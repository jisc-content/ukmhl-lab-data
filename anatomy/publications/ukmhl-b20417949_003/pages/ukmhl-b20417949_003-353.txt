The flocculus is a prominent tuft, divided into several laminiB, and situated below and behind the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. It is connected with the nodule by a thin valvular fold of white substance, the inferior medullary velum, which is continuous with the central white stem of the cerebellum; the inferior medullary velum is partly concealed by the tonsil. The antero-posterior section of the cerebellum presents the well-known appearance termed the arbor vitae. The central white core, or corpus trapezoides, sends stems to the various lobules, and from these a branch is given off to each folium. Core, stem, and branches are surrounded by the external grey matter. In the medullary core of the lateral hemisphere is a collection of grey matter, the corpus dentatum. This much resembles the olivary nucleus of the medulla. On section it shows a thin wavy lamina of grey matter folded upon itself so as to form a

228s At the outer and back part of the hard palate can be felt the hamular process of the sphenoid. A little in front of this the posterior palatine artery emerges from the posterior palatine canal—a point to be borne in mind in uranoplasty. The Tonsil,—liies between the anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces, in close proximity to the internal carotid artery, between which and the tonsil are only the superior constrictor muscle and the fibrous wall of the pharynx. Externally, the tonsil corresponds to the angle of the jaw. The Pterygo-Maxillary Ligament.—May be felt, behind the last molar tooth and below and in front of the tonsil, passing down from the hamular process to the back part of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw. A little below it is the gustatory nerve, pressure upon which causes acute pain. Division of the nerve gives temporary relief in cancer of the tongue. Tor the examination of the throat, the head should be thrown well back, and the nostrils pinched: the soft palate is then instinctively raised in order to facilitate breathing through the mouth. On the nostrils being relaxed, the soft palate will become pendulous, when the finger can be passed behind it to explore the posterior aperture of the nares. Parts in the Middle Line of the Neck.—From above down- wards : Hyoid bone, thyro-hyoid membrane, thyroid cartilage, crico-thyroid membrane, cricoid cartilage, trachea—of which the second, third, and fourth rings are covered by the isthmus of the thyroid gland. Hyoid Bone.—Can easily be felt when grasped from side to side. Thyro-Hyoid Membrane.—Behind it is the lower part of the epiglottis. It is pierced on either side by the superior laryngeal nerve and the laryngeal branch of the superior thyroid artery.

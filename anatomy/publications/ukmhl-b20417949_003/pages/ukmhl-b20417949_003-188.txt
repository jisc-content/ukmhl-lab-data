228o SUMMARY OF PRACTICAL POINTS. HEAD AND NECK. The Scalp.—Eirmly connected to the tendon of the occipito- frontalis, and moves with it. A scalp wound will generally divide the tendon. Tendon of the OccipitO-Frontalis.—But loosely connected to the pericranium. Between the two is a stratum of loose cellular tissue, which readily becomes the seat of diffuse inflammatory infiltration and sloughing. Arteries of the Scalp. — Frontal, emerging from the superior internal angle of the orbit. Supra-orbital, emerging from supra-orbital notch or foramen at junction of inner and middle thirds of supra-orbital arch. Temporal, running between condyle of lower jaw and external auditory meatus, and then crossing the posterior root of the zygoma; divides into anterior and posterior branches. Posterior auricular, over front part of mastoid process. Occipital, about midway between mastoid process and external occipital protuberance. All these arteries are subcutaneous.* * One is well repaid for a perusal of Mr. Treves's excellent chapter on the Scalp. See Treves's " Applied Anatomy."

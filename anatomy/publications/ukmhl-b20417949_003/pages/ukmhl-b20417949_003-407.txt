348cc y. CRANIO-CEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY. The relations of the convolutions to surface markings are variable within certain limits, not only at different ages and iu the two sexes, but in different individuals of the same age and sex, and therefore can only be relied upon as approximations. It is doubtful, indeed, how far there is constancy of position of any group of nerve cells ; and " it is possible that, while each group may occupy a constant position with regard to its neighbours, yet, on account of the varying development of the several areas, the absolute sites of each group are not as constant as their relative positions, and that a group which in one brain occupies the crest of a convolution, may be in another on the slope of a gyrus, or even in the trough between two gyri. The patterns of the convolutions are but expressions of the relative rates of growth of the different areas of the surface."— (Macalister.) 1.—The Pour Cardinal Points on the Cranial Surface. Bregma.—Junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures ; lies in the centre of a line drawn across the vertex from one external auditory meatus to the other, the head being in its usual erect position, - that is, the upper border of the zygoma being horizontal. It corresponds to the anterior fontanelle, which is diamond-shaped in the infant.

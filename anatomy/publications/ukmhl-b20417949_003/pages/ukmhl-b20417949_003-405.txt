348aa The severat. cortical branches of the above arteries, with the parts they supply, may be tabt'lated as follows : — Inferior internal frontal. - Two or three. Supply the g-.yrus rectus, the olfactory I peduncle and bulb, and the internal orbital convolution. I Anterior internal frontal. - Supply the front part of marginal and oallosal gyri. Anterior j and neighbouring part of outer surface of hemisphere. Cerebral Artery.^ Middle internal frontal. - Supplies the paracentral lobule, and neighbouring part of outer surface of the hemisphere. Posterior internal frontal. - Supplies the greater part of the cuneate lobule and .neighbouring part of outer surface of hemisphere. External orbital. Inferior frontal, Ascendi7ig frontal. Ascending temporal. - ,^ Supply the convolutions of same name. Parieto-temporal. - Relatively large branch issuing from the back part of the , posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and supplying the central part of the parietal Cerebral Artery. 1 j^^^g I Temporal. - Supply the superior temporal convolution and the upper part of the ( middle temporal convolution. f Temporal. - Two or three. Pass outwards over the hippocampal gyrus, and I ramify on the under & outer surfaces of the temporal & occipital lobes. Posterior ,' Calcarine. - Runs along the calcarine fissure, and supplies the cuneus, the Cerebral Arterylingual lobule, and outer neighbouring outer surface of hemisphere. 1 Parieto-occipital. - Runs up in the parieto-occipital fissure, and supplies the I cuneus and precunius, and neighbouring part of outer surface of hemisphere.

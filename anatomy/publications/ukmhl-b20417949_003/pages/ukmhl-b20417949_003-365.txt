335 ^^•B.—The above is not the present classica description of the Arachnoid. See note, p. 348e, COVERINGS of the BRAIN & GORD-~2nd Tablet. THE ARACHNOID Surrounds the brain & cord, from which it is separated by the sub-arachnoidean space. Visceral Layer of the Arachnoid of the Brain — On the upper surface of tho hemispheres it is thin & transpaient, and passes over the convolutions without dipping into the sulci. - At the base of the brain it is thicker and slightly opaque. Crossing from side to side between the two temporo-sphenoidal lobes and between the two hemispheres of the cerebellum & the medulla oblongata, it bounds inferiorly the anterior posterior subarachiioidean spaces. It is reflected round the cranial nerves in the shape of loose sheaths as far as their point exit from the skull, where it becomes continuous with the parietal layer. Visceral layer of the Arachnoid of the Cord — Forms, especially in the lower part, but a loose sheath round the cord & the roots of the nerves. This sheath is single round the two roots of each spinal nerve, and is continued as far ai5 their exit from the dura mater J the arachnoid is also reflected over the processes of the ligamentum denticulatum. THE SUBARACHNOIDEAN SPACE Is comprised between the pia mater & the visceral layer of the arachnoid, and contains the cerebro-spinal fluid. It usually communicates with the general ventricular cavity of the brain by an opening in the layer of pia mater which bounds the fourth ventric>' inferiorly. It is narrow on the surface of the hemispheres, but is greatly expanded both at the base of the brain in the situation of the anterior & posterior subarachnoidean spaces, and also round the spinal cord. It is crossed by numerous fibrous bands in the situation of the base of the brain and at the upper part of the back of the cord, and is partly subdivided by an incomplete membranous septum which connects the arachnoid with the pia mater opposite the posterior median fissure.

228a Added, 1897. NOTES ON THE NEWEE MATTEE. Sdmmerlng's Classification of the Cranial Nerves. Following the Continental custom, British anatomists now frequently reckon separately the two nerves of the 7th pair of Willis's classification, and the three nerves of the 8th pair. This gives twelve pairs of cranial nerves, which are renumbered from the Sth onwards as follows :â€” 8th , Auditory. 9th Glosso-pharyngeal. 10th ... Pneumogastric. 11th Spinal accessory. 12 th Hypoglossal. This is the classification of Sommering, based upon the succession fTom before backwards of the apparent origins. The classification of Willis was based upon the succession of the foramina of the base of the skull through which the several nerves leave the cranium. In this latter classification, facial & auditory, as they leave the cranium through the same foramen, counted as one nerve; and so did, for the same reason, the glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, & spinal accessory. A third classification is being worked out by degrees, based on the succession of the real origins. Cervical Plexus & the Hypoglossal Nerve. A paragraph of some interest must now be detached from the description of the hypoglossal nerve, and transferred to that of the cervical plexus. The distribution of

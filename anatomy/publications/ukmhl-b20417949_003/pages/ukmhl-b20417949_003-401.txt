848w pineal body. The latter results from the mode of reflection of the ventricular epithelium on to the under surface of the velum interpositum. The ventricalar epithelium passes back- wards over the anterior half or two-thirds of the upper surface of the pineal body before being reflected upwards and forwards on to the velum. The recess thus caused cannot, of course, be seen in ordinary dissecting, but it appears as a pi-ojection on a cast of the ventricular cavity. FORAMEN OF MONRO.

It is still stated by advanced, as it always has been by dissectiona], anatomists, that the anterior extremities of the velum interpositum pass from the 3rd into the lateral ventricles through the foramina of Monro, It will easily be seen that the statement is not correct from the modern standpoint: The apertures of communication between the lateral and 3rd ventricles, taken in the modern sense, or emhryologice, being the apertures of communication between the cavities bounded by the epithelial linings of these cavities, these apertures of communication themselves, or the foramina of Monro taken emhryologice, must of a necessity be bounded by their own epithelial lining ; and, as the choroid plexuses lie behind and outside this epithelial lining, these are necessarily foreign to the

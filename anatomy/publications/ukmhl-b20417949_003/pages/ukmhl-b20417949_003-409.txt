348ee Fissure of Rolando {Reid's Method).—Draw a base line from the lowest part oj the infra,-orbital margin through the middle of the external auditory meatus to the back of the head (Fig. 585). Draw two lines perpendicular to the above - the one from the depression in front of the external auditory meatus, and the other opposite the posterior border of the mastoid process at its root to the middle line of the head, taken as drawn : there is now constituted a four-sided figure. The diagonal drawn from the Fig. 585. -RELATION OF PRINCIPAb FISSURES AND CONVOLUTIONS TO THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE SCALP, (Reid.) posterior-superior angle to the point where the anterior perpendicular crosses the fissure of Sylvius will represent the fissure of Rolando. Other methods; Upper end of the Fissure—Lies half an inch behind the mid-point of the vertex, - that is, half an inch behind the middle of the distance between the external occipital protuberance and the nasal eminence, or glabella TThane). (It may perhaps be more correct to fix the upper end of the fissure at a distance from the external occipital protuberance equal to 55-6 per cent, of the distance between that point and the glabella.) From its upper end the fissure passes downwards and forwards for 3f inches, forming an angle of 67° (Cunningham says 71*5°) with the middle line of the head. Lower end of the Fissure.—Lies half an inch behind the bifurcation of the fissure of Sylvius, and close to its horizontal limb (Thane).

220 ABTICULATIONS of the CRANIUM with the^SPINE Are the occipito-otloid and occipiio-axoid artionlations, from which articulations the ath-axoi articiilation cannot well be poparatei OCCIPITO-ATLOID ARTICULATION — consists of a double artlnodia betwee condyles of occipital and superior articular surfivces of atlas; the condyles bein convex from before backwards & inwards and looking downwards & outwards, an the articular surfaces of the atlas being concave from before backwards & inwarc and looking upwards & inwards. The ligaments are: Capsular - Two. Thin & loose; surround the arthrodial articulations.

256n DEVELOPMENT OP THE CENTRAL VENOUS SYSTEM. The central venous system results from the metamorphoses of the cardinal, and of the vitelline & umbilical veins. Cardinal Veins. These are four symmetrical and parallel veins, two superior (jugular, or primitive jugular veins) and two inferior (or cardinal veins proper), which lie on either side and along the whole length of the spinal column, and converge towards the heart, - those of either side joining to form two short trunks, the canals of Cuvier, Avhich open into the auricular portion of the heart on either side of the vitelline or omphalo-mesenteric vein. The cardinal veins receive numerous lateral branches, or " intercostal " veins, from either side of the body. A Fig. 22.â€”DiAGRAii of the cardinal veins. r.j., right upper cardinal vein, or right jugular; l.j., left upper cardinal vein, or lefc jugular ; r.c, I.e., right and left cardinal veins ; r.C, l.C, right and left ducts of Cuvier. When the upper limbs develop, two of these veins enlarge, and become the snhclavians. (See Diagrams B, C, and D.) The portions of the superior cardinal, or primitive jugular, veins situated above the subclavians become the external jugular veins.* The portion of the right primitive jugular vein below the subclavian becomes the right innominate vein, superiorly, and the superior cena cava, inferiorly. The corre- sponding portion of the left primitive jugular conti.acts into the left .superior intercostal. At this stage there is no internal jugular vein. It is the external jugular vein vk^hich first, through the mastoid foramen, drains the blood from the lateral sinus ; and it is through the gradual closure of the mastoid foramen, and the consequent decrease in size of the external jugular vein, that the internal jugular vein subsaquently develops, and, joining the lower part of the primitive jugular, comes in a large measure, to take the place of the external jugular.

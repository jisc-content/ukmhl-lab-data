THE CEREBELLUM. The cerebellum is oblong from side to side and flattened from above downwards, and presents two surfaces and a circumference. It consists of two lateral hemispheres connected by a median lobe, the vermiform process, which is divided into upper and lower vermes. The circumference of the cerebellum is notched in front and behind. The anterior notch, or incisura semilunaris, is the widest; it embraces the superior peduncles and the testes. The posterior notch, or incisura marsupialis^ is narrower and deeper, and receives the falx cerebri. The circumference of the cerebellum is divided into upper and lower lips by the great horizontal fissure, which deeply indents the organ externally and behind, in front this fissure is widely open for the emergence of the cerebellar peduncles. The upper surface is flattened on either side, and slightly elevated in the centre. Quite anteriorly it presents the Lingula, consisting of four or five narrow Fig. 536.—uppur surface of the cerebellt'm, diagrammatic. Fig. 537. —lpi'ER surface of the cerebellum, photographed.

Behind this is the Lobus Centralis, somewhat broader, but also of small extent from side to side ; the lobus centralis lies at the bottom of the semilunar notch, and is but little seen from above; but laterally it gives off two more prominent processes, the al?e, which partially surround the semilunar notch. Behind the foregoing comes the much broader Lolms Culminis, consisting of a central portion, the culmen monticuli^ belonging to the superior vermiform process, and of two lateral portions, the anterior rrescentic lobes, belonging to the lateral hemispheres. The culmen mohticuli constitutes the highest part, or monticulus, of the superior vermiform process. The anterior crescentic lobe completes the lateral boundary of the semilunar

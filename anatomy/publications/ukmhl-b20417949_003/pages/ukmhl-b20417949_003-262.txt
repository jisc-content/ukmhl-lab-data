256b Anterior Mediastinum.—Is oblique downwards, and to the left on account of the inclination of the heart. It is relatively broad below, where it contains the origin of the triangularis sterni muscle, the lower part of the left internal mammary vessels, some fat and lymphatic glands. It is much narrower above, and usually ceases to exist opposite the upper segment of the gladiolus, since, as a rule, the anterior borders of the two lungs here come in contact. Superior and Inferior Sterno-Pericardial Ligaments. These are two variable bands of fibrous tissue extending frcm the sternal fourchette and the xyphoid appendix to the upper and lower parts respectively of the front of the pericardium. The upper one is the strongest, and is occasionally somewhat cord-like. The lower one is weaker, and frequently indistinguishable. Transverse Sinus of the Pericardium Is the passage, Avithin the cavity of the pericardium, between the complete but common serous sheath to the aorta and pulmonary artery in front, the superior vena cava on the right and the auricles below and behind. Fig. 19.—diagram of the eeflfxtioxs of the serois layer of the pericardum from the fibrous layer on to the great vessels that reach the heart, - the heart beikg removed. (after macalister.) The transverse sinus is supposed to have resulted from the fusion, through absorption of the septum between them, of two originally separate sinuses, one situited on the right side of the aorta & pulmonary artery, and the other on the left side of these vessels. The incomplete character of th3 serous covering to the several other large vessels connected to the base of the heart leads to various pouches or sinuses, between

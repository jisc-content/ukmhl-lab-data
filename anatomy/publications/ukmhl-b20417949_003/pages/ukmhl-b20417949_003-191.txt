228r The Nostril, or Anterior Aperture of the Nose—is on a lower level than the floor of the nasal fossa. When raised, it allows of the inspection of the lower part of the nasal cavity, including the inferior turbinated bone. Septum Nasi,—Is generally deviated a little to one side or other, narrowing the nasal fossa of that side. Coronary Arteries.—Surround the buccal aperture lying close to the mucous membrane, and can be compressed from within the mouth. The hare-lip pins are passed deeply in the operation for hare-lip. Steno's Duct.—Runs along a line drawn from the lower part of the concha to a point midway between the free margin of the lip and the ala of the nose, and opens on the summit of a small papilla opposite the second molar tooth of the upper jaw. The Tongue.—is rough over the anterior two-thirds of its dorsum, and smooth posteriorly. On its under surface, in front of the frenum, it presents a narrow median furrow. On either side of this are the ranine veins ; these indicate the position of the corresponding arteries. The middle line of the tongue is but slightly vascular. The Sublingual G-landS.—Stand out on the floor of the mouth on either side of the frenum. On their inner side we find the sublingual artery, which is endangered when the frenum is too freely divided. Tendons of the G-enio-HyO-GrloSSi.—May be felt in the middle line of the floor of the mouth, just behind the jaw-bone. Their division allows the tongue to be drawn very freely out of the mouth, as may be necessary in the removal of a cancer of the organ.

Fig. 31)8.â€”the three branches of the fifth nerve. (Hirschfeld.) I, Gasserian g-anglion. (2) Ophthalmic nerve. (3, 4, 5) Its frontal, lachrymal, and nasal branches. (6) Lenticular ganglion, with its three roots and its ciliary offsets. (7) Superior maxillary nerve ; 8 & 13, its orbital or temporo-malar and its posterior dental branches (9) Meckel's ganglion, hanging down from the superior maxillary nerve by the spheno-palatine branches of the latter; 10, large superficial petrosal branch of the facial, con- stituting its motor root, and joining with the sympathetic root a little before reaching the ganglion ; II, palatine nerves passing down from the ganglion, and entering the palatine canals. (15) The inferior maxillary nerve, with, 18, its masseteric and deep temporal branches divided. (16) Auriculo-temporal nerve, arising by two roots which embraced the middle meningeal artery. The nerve is seen winding round the neck of the condyle and the temporal artery, and anastomosing with the temporo-cervical branch of the facial; 17, buccal nerve. (19) Inferior dental nerve, with its branches to the molar & bicuspid teeth, and its terminal or mental branch, 20. (21) Lingual or gustatory nerve, receiving the chorda tympani from the facial, 22. (23) Facial nerve, dividing into its two terminal branches, temporo- and cervico-facial, the latter anastomosing with the auriculo-temporal. C, D, temporal & internal maxillary arteries ; F, middle meningeal in the partly opened foramer rotundum; c, orbicularis oris, partly cut away ; d, Steno's duct, piercing the buccinator ; /, externa] pterygoid, divided.

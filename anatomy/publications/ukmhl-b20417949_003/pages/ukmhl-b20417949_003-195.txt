228v The facial artery grooves tlie upper and back part of the submaxillary gland, and then crosses the lower jaw in front of the masseter. Between the sternal and clavicular heads of the sterno-mastoid lie the common carotid artery internally, and the internal jugular vein externally. The vein, at this level, is clearly external to the artery on the right side of the neck, while, on the left side, it approaches and sometimes crosses it. Between and behind the two vessels is the pneumo-gastric nerve. The phrenic nerve lies external to the vein, in front of the scalenus anticus. Between the two sterno-mastoids, at the lower part of the neck, is the " fonticulus gutturis," which rises and sinks in distressed breathing. The sterno-clavicular articulation marks the commencement of the innominate vein, and, on the right side, the division of the innominate artery. The Supra-Clavicular Fossa.— is crossed at its lower and inner part by the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid. Below, and then externally to this, it is crossed more or less horizontally, and at a somewhat variable level, by the supra-scapular and transversalis colli vessels; so that, in the ligature of the subclavian artery, the knife should be used with much care after the platysma and deep fascia have been divided. The Triangle formed by the Scaleni Muscles corresponds pretty nearly to the outer border of the sterno-mastoid. Its base is formed by the first rib. Upon this rests the subclavian artery, which can here be controlled by pressure downwards and inwards upon the bone. Above the artery are the cords of the brachial plexus. The subclavian vein lies below and in front of the artery, in front of the scalenus anticus. The Lung.—Eises half an inch or an inch above the clavicle, and its apex can be examined by auscultation and percussion through the soft parts of the supra-clavicular fossa. {Bee practical questions at end of hook.)

228p Externa] Occipital Protuberance.—Always perceptible to the finger. Corresponds to the torcular Herophili. Gives attachment to the ligamentum nuchse. From either side of it spring the superior curved lines of the occipital bone, which give attachment to the trapezius, sterno-mastoid, and occipito-frontalis. The inferior curved lines are out of reach of the finger. Frontal Sinuses.—Do not exist in childhood. They are formed, as age advances, by the separation of the two tables of the skull. The absence of the usual external prominence does not necessarily indicate the absence of the sinuses, which may be formed by the retrocession of the inner table of the skull. Neither does a prominent bump necessarily imply a large sinus. The same remark applies to the mastoid cells. External Auditory Canal.—Euns forwards and inwards, with a slight concavity downwards, and is an inch and a quarter long in the adult. To straighten the canal for inspection the auricle should be drawn upwards and backwards. The membrana tympmii is oblique downwards and inwards. It is slightly concave, and the handle of the malleolus can be seen adhering to its upper half. Branches of the Fifth Nerve and Corresponding Vessels. —The supra-orbital nerve and artery emerge from the orbit through the supra-orbital notch or foramen at junction of inner and middle thirds of supra-orbital arch. The infra-orbital and mental foramina, with the corre- sponding vessels and nerves, are in a line drawn from this point to the interval between the bicuspid teeth of the lower jaw. The auriculo-temporal nerve emerges from under cover of the parotid gland behind the temporal artery, and accompanies the two branches of the latter. Condyle of the Lower Jaw.—Can be felt, when the mouth is opened and shut, to glide forwards and backwards upon the eminentia articularis, in front of the external auditory meatus.

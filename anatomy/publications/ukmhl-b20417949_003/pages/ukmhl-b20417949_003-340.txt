310 THE THIRD VENTRICLE Is a narrow median fissure comprised between the optic thalami, and extendinr; to the base of the brail It presentj Roof-Formed by under surface of fornix and by velum interpositum. (See morphologic] A^iew, p. 348t Floor - Corresponds to interpeduncular space on under surface of cerebrum, and is form from before backwards by the tuber cinereum & infundibulum, corpora albicantia, ai locus pc^foratus posticus. It is prolonged downwards and forwards into a recess, whi| passes, in the foetus, into the iter ad infundibulum Lateral Walls - Formed by inner surfaces of optic thalami, which surfaces are bounded abo bv the striai pineales. or superior penduncles of pineal gland, and are covered belc by part of the grey matter of the 3rd ventricle prolonged upwards from its floor. - T lateral walls are joined togedier by the middle or soft commissure, a transverse ba of grey matter continuous with the remainder of the grey matter of the 3rd ventric Ant. Boundary (See Fig. 52G) - Formed by anterior crura of fornix. In front of these the lamina cinerea and the anterior commissure. - Between the crura & the optic thala are the foramina of Monro, through which the lateral & 3rd ventricles communiCE and the anterior extremities of the velum interpositum pass from the 3rd into the late A-entricles to form the choroid plexuses of the latter. (See morphological view, p. 348 Post. Boundary (See Fig. 527) - Formed by posterior commissure, a transverse band white fibres connecting posteriorly the optic thalami. Below this is the opening of aqueduct of sylvius or iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum ; above are the tuberc quadrigemina & the pineal gla For other recesses, see p. 348v.

the tuber valvulte of the under surface, the folium oacuminis forms the anterior boundary of the marsupial notch. It constitutes the narrow link between the two expanded posterior superior lobes. The itnder surface of the cerebellum is rounded and elevated laterally, and depressed in the middle line. Quite posteriorly, and at the sides, this surface presents the posterior inferior lohe, which forms the lower boundary of the jireat horizontal fissure. This lobe constitutes the lateral part of the Lohus Tuheris. The central portion of the latter is the tuber valculce, which, with the above-mentioned folium cacuminis of the upper surface, bounds anteriorly the marsupial notch. Laterally, there is usually associated with the tuber valvulte the slender lobe, or lobus gracilis, which is not directly connected Avith it, however. In front of the foregoing is the Lobus Pyramidis, consisting centrally of the pyramid, and laterally of the digastric or biventral lobes. More anteriorly and centrally, and embraced by the foregoing, is the Lobus Uvuhe, consisting of the uvula and Fig. 540.—i NDKR .slrface hk xiih; cerkuelluai, thk left tonsh, BETNO REMOVED, I)[AttRAM.MATIC.

The uvula is a somewhat triangular elevation, placed between the two ami/gdahe, to which it is connected by a narrow ridge, the furrowed band, lying deeply in the valley, and crossed by transverse furrows.

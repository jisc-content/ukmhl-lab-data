348bh FlG.:583.â€”ARTERIALiDISTRIBUTION ON UNDER^SURFACE OF BRAIN. (Cunningham.) It will be seen that the minute vascularisation of the brain has been treated apart from the course and general distribution the arteries which reach that organ. The subject, which originated with Charcot's lectures on cerebral localisation published in Paris in 1876, is one and undivisible, - a unit as regards both the premises submitted and the conclusions reached, - Charcot's preamble, in fact, to the clinica study of cerebral degeneration and haemorrhage. In the usual way of presenting it, it is broken up into bits. The six branches of the ganglionic system are distributed among the several tributaries of the circle of Willis : two go to the anterior cerebrals, one to the anterior communicating, one to the basilar, two to the posterior cerebrals. These are thus presented, as a rule, several pages apart. The same thing is repeated in regard to the arteries of the cortical system. When tracing out either the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral artery, it may nicely round off the customary statement to give the minute physiological distribution of the same. But such advantage has its drawbacks. It is through this splitting up of subjects, a practice which is yearly increasing, that modern study becomes more and more a burdening of the memory, and the examination, in a measure, a test as to mere remembering.

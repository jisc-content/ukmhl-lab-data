228t Thyroid Cartilage.—The projection of its upper border, or pomum Adann, and the notch which it presents, are relatively little marked in the female, and in the male before puberty. The upper part of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland can be felt, especially when enlarged, on either alse the cartilage. The gland moves up and down with the cartilage in deglutition. CricO-Thyroid Membrane.—is crossed by the small artery of the same name, a branch of the superior thyroid, which is of little importance surgically. In laryngotomy, the membrane is first exposed by a vertical incision, and then divided transversely close to the cricoid cartilage—that is, as far as possible from the vocal cords. Cricoid Cartilage.—Is the first guide in the ligature of the common carotid, pharyngotomy, &c. Behind it the pharynx narrows into the commencement of the oesophagus. Foreign bodies frequently lodge at this point. The Trachea.—Recedes from the surface as it descends. Unless the low division be specially indicated, the canal had better be opened as high as possible. The isthmus of the thyroid gland (which crosses the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea) can be either drawn down or divided; or the cricoid cartilage, with the two or three first rings of the trachea, may be divided (laryngo-tracheotomy). The Inferior Thyroid Veins.—Are necessarily distended when tracheotomy is required. They should be avoided as far as possible, and any abundant hsemorrhage should be stopped before the trachea is opened. The left innominate vein rises somewhat dangerously high in front of the lower part of the trachea. In front of the trachea there is sometimes a small artery—the thyroidea ima. In children, the thymus gland may rise a little above the sternum.

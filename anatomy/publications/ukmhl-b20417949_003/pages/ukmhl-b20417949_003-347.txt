MEDULLA OBLONGATA, CEREBELLUM, MESOCEPHALON, &c. NOTE. The Author has endeavoured to present the anatomy of the medulla and meso- cephalon* from the double standpoint of (I.) Dissectional or objective anatomy, - in the Tablets ; and (II.) Structural anatomy as raa'le out by transverse sections, see Notes, p. 348hh. It will be noticed that the same anatomical terms, - e.^r., restiform bodies, crura cerebri, anterior pyramids, &c.,-have been used in different senses under Land under II. Thus, under I., the restiform bodies are the two wide and thick bundles, easily seen hy the dissector, to all appearances the continuation of the posterior columns of the cord, which diverge superiorly to expose the grey of the Hoor of the 4th ventricle ; while, under II., the restiform bodies are the upper part only of such structures, which upper part no naked-eye examination can distinguish from the lower part of the same. Simi- Urly, under I., the crura cerebri are the two thick cylindrical or slightly flattened bundles, also easily seen by the dissector, which emerge from beneath the anterior border of the pons, and pass forwards and outwards to the cerebrum, bounding the posterior perforating space, &c. ; while, under II., the crura cerebri include, in addition to the above, the conjoined tegmenta, structures entirely different, and largely removed from view. It will easily be seen why the terms have been used, and have had to be used, in varying senses, and why conflicting statements - which will easily be reconciled- have had to be submitted. The description of the Cerebellum is now so overburdened with details, mostly meaningless to the author's mind, that, as a matter of convenience, the subject has been treated in the form of a Note, and not as a Tablet. For the significance of the term Mesocephalon, .see Note, p. 331.

228q Ramus of the Jaw.—incisions made over this should be horizontal in direction, so that they may avoid both Steno's duct and the facial nerve. Stents duct runs along a line from the lower part of the concha to a point midway between the free margin of the lip and the ala of the nose. The trunk of the facial nerve passes downwards and forwards from the point where the anterior border of the mastoid process meets the ear. Facial Artery.—Crosses the lower jaw in front of the masseter, where it can be felt and compressed. It passes upwards and forwards to near the angle of the mouth, where it lies close to the mucous membrane, and can be felt and compressed from within. Its coronary branches also lie near to the mucous membrane. The artery then ascends along the side of the nose to a little to the inner side of the tendo oculi, where it joins with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. Puncta Lachrymalia.—The lower one is slightly the larger, and the more external. The lower lachrymal canal runs first downwards and then inwards, forming an angle, which the surgeon obliterates, before introducing Weber's knife, by drawing the lower lid outwards. Tendo Oculi.—Crosses the lachrymal sac a little above its middle. It is easily seen when made tense by drawing the lower lid outwards. A puncture just below it would enter the lower part of the lachrymal sac. Nasal Duct.—Runs downwards, backwards, and outwards. It is from half to three-quarters of an inch in length, and ends in the inferior meatus of the nose. Its inferior aperture is sometimes on the roof of the meatus, when it is large and round, and sometimes on the outer wall of the meatus, when it is smaller and slit-like. The Skin of the Nose.—is firmly connected to the cartilages ; hence the acute pain felt in erysipelas and small boils on the nose.

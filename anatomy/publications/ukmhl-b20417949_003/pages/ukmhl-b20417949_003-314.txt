The Inferior or Orbital Surface of the Frontal Lobe will be best introduced here. It presents the gyrus rectus, or straight convolution, and the three orhiial convolutions, internal {!.), anterior (^A.^, and posterior (P.), which latter are respectively continuous with the superior, middle, and inferior frontal convolutions of the outer surface. These convolutions are demarcated by the straight or olfactory, and the triradiate, sulci. The straight or olfactary sulcus (olf.) is pai-allel to the longitudinal fissure, and lodges the olfactory tract and bulb. The triradiate sulcus (tr.) usually presents three branches, running backwards, inwards, and outwards. It is sometimes H-shaped, another branch running forwards from the external branch. The gyrus rectus is sometimes described as forming part of the internal orbital convolution.

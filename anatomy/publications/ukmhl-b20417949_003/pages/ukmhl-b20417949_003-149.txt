215 STRUCTURE of the PHARYNX. Presents three coats, which, from without inwards, are muscular, fibrous, muoous; and vessels & nerves. MUSCULAR COAT — Is formed by r Inferior Constrictor - Side of cricoid cartilage J oblique line on outer surface of ala of thyroid cartilage & surface behind it, and inferior cornu. Eaph6 on posterior median line of pharynx ; its inferior fibres being hori- zontal & continuous with those of cesophagus, and its superior fibres passing obliquely upwards and overlapping those of the middle constrictor. - S. by pharyngeal plexus and external & recurrent laryngeal nerves. IVEicLdle Constrictor - Whole extent of upper surface of great cornu of hyoid bone, lesser cornu, stylo-hyoid ligament. Raph6 on posterior median line of pharynx; its inferior fibres descending beneath inferior constrictor, its middle fibres being horizontal, and its sup- erior fibres overlapping superior constrictor & stylo-pharyngens. - S. by pharyn- geal plexus. Superior Constrictor - Lower third of free margin of internal pterygoid plate, its hamul'ar process, & contiguous part of palate bone; pterygo-maxillary ligament; alveolar process of inferior maxilla above mylo-hyoid ridge; side of tongue. Eaph6 on posterior median line of pharynx; its superior fibres ascending by means of strong fibrous band below mentioned, to pharyngeal spine on basilar process, its lower fibres being horizontal. - S. by pharyngeal plexus. Stylo-pharyngeuS - inner side of base of styloid process. With palato-pharyngeus into posterior border of thyroid cartilaere & side of pharynx. - S. by pharyngeal plexus & glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Palato-pharyngeus - Posterior surface of soft palate by two heads separated by levator palati. With stylo-pharyngeus into posterior border of thyroid cartilage & side of pharynx. - S. by pharyngeal plexus. SalpingO-pharyngeUS (Santorini) - Small fasciculus from outer surface of cartila- ginous portion of Eustachian tube to stylo-pharyngeus, with which it blends inferiorlv. Is often wanting. Other accessory muscles, the petro-, spheno-, & occipito-pharyngei, are also described; but they are rarely met with. Eelations - The constrictors overlap each other from below upwards. The stylo- pharyngeus passes between superior & middle constrictors; the superior laryngeal nerve between the middle & inferior constrictors; the recurrent laryngeal nerve beneath the inferior. - (Vide also relations of pharynx in foregoing Tablet). FIBROUS COAT, or PHARYNGEAL APONEUROSIS - Thick above, thin below. Attached to petrous portion of temporal bone, under surface of body of sphen- oid, and, by means of a strong fibrous band (cranio-pharyngeal ligament, Thomson & Cleland), to pharyngeal spine on under surface of basilar process. IVrnnOTTS MEMBRANE — Thick on under surface of body of sphenoid; covered wiih MUCOUb M^mJ3gA^^^ as low down as floor of nares, with squamous epitheliam Selow Beneath it are found numerous glands, which are simple & compound follicular and racemose.

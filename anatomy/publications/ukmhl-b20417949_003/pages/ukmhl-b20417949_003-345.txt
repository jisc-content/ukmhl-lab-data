Fig. 530.â€”the third and KorrRTii ventkicles. (Hirschfeld.) 14, upper surface of optic thalamus, atid groove, corresponding- to the marg-in of the fornix and the choroid plexus, separating- the portion covered by the abo\ e from the anterior tubercle, 15; 11, 12, tubercula quadrigemina and pineal gland ; 13, superior peduncle of the pineal gland or stria pinealis : between the origin of this and the optic thalamus there is a small triangular depression, the trigonum habenulse ; in front of the anterior tubercle is seen the divided anterior crus of the fornix, 18, with, between the two, the foramen of Monro; between the two crura is the anterior conunissure, 19. IG, third ventricle; 17, middle or soft commissure ; 20, 21, lamina cornea and taenia semicireularis ; 22, nucleus caudatus ; 23, radiating fibres of internal capsule exposed through the removal of foregoing ; 24, fifth ventricle; 1, 2, fourth ventricle; 3, valve of Vieussens, divided ; 5, foramen of Magendie ; 6, lingula ; 7, nodule ; 8, frajnulum ; 9, arbor vita; ; 10, 11, descending cornu of lateral ventricle. The internal geniculate body is now, by advanced anatomists, detached from the optic thalamus on physiological grounds, and as belonging to the mid-brain : It is no longer referred to by the advanced school in connection with the optic thalamus.* It appears to have no functional connection with the optic nerve, and to be merely related to the intercerebral fibres of the tract and commissure, or fibres of Gudden (see p. 228d). It undergoes no change after removal of the eye-balls. The optic thalamus is indistinctly divided into three nuclei - external, internal, and antero-superior. In shape, the latter is not unlike the caudate nucleus. Its anterior and largest part forms the anterior tubercle ; it then passes backward above and between the two other nuclei. * Dissectionally, however, there the two geniculate bodies ai-e side by side, the internal and the external, and one exactly like the other.

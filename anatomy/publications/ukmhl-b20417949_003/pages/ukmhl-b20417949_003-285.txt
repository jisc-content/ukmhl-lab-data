256y The Vertebral Spines.—Can he felt from the sixth cervical down- wards, the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra being the most prominent (V. prominens). The upper cervical spines, which lie in front of the ligamentum nuchsD, recede too much from the surface to be perceptible to the finger, except, possibly, the bifid extremity of the axis. The dorsal spines lie in the median furrow caused by the projection of the erectores spinse. They do not lie on a level with corresponding rib and corresponding vertebral body; each lies on a level with the head of the rib and the body of the vertebra below. This is due to the obliquity of the dorsal spinous processes. The two lower dorsal spinous processes are less oblique, and tally pretty accurately with the heads of the corresponding ribs. Correspondences of the Principal Spines, mainly according to Holden:— Dorsal Spines.—4th. Bifurcation of trachea; aorta reaches spine. 5th. End of aortic arch; upper level of heart. 8th. Lower level of heart; central tendon of diaphragm. 9th. (Esophagus and vena cava perforate diaphragm, and former opens into stomach ; upper extremity of spleen. 10th. Upper limit, posteriorly, of convex surface of liver. 11th. Lower extremity of spleen. 12th. Limit of pleura behind: aorta perforates diaphragm. Lumbar Spines.—1st. Kenal arteries; pelvis of kidney. 2nd. Superior mesenteric artery crosses intestine, and mesentery begins ; receptaculum chili; termination of spinal cord. 3rd. Umbilicus. 4th. Division of aorta; highest part of crest of ilium. Scapula.—Covers the ribs from the third to the seventh. The root of the spine is marked by a slight dimpling of the skin. It lies on a level with the third dorsal spine. (See practical questions at end of book,)

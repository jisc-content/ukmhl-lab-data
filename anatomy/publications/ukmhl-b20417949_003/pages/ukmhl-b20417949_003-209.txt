(Moms.) Some of the fibres of the thyro-arytenoideus and of the crico-arytenoidei lateralis and posticus join l)oth the horizontal and the oblique fibres of the arytenoideus. Some of the lower fibres of the crico-arj'tenoideus posticus are occasionally inserted inio the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage : these fibres constitute the kerato-cricoideus muscle. Different names are gi\ en to the horizontal and to the oblique portions of the arytenoideus. The former portion is said to form the arytenoideus transmrsus. The latter is the arytenoideus obliquus, and * The smaller miiscles of the larynx supply perhaps the most telling object- lesson one c.onld select as to the now-a-day tendencies in Anatomy, The muscles of the larynx that everybody can see are the same in number and,

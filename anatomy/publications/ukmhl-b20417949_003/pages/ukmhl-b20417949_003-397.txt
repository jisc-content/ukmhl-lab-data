348s in. INTERIOR OF THE BRAIN. (These Notes should be read in conjunction with the pages they are respectively stated to refer to.) Parts seen in Posterior & Descending Cornua.â€”A Note to pp. 296 & 300. The calcar avis and the bulb of the cornu are now placed by some anatomists on the inner wall of the posterior cornu, and not on its floor; and below them, on the floor of the cornu, there is said to be, an elevation caused by the fasciculus longitutidinalis inferior. Similarly, the hippocampus major, pes hippocampi, corpus fimbriatum, and choroid plexus are now placed by some on the inner wall of the descending cornu. And on the roof of the cornu there is said to be an elevation, the amygdaloid tubercle, due to the projection of the amygdaloid nucleus, or enlarged extremity of the narrow posterior part of the caudate nucleus, into which the taenia semicircularis is also prolonged. It will be noticed that the Tablets, as opposed to the Notes, make no mention of the amygdaloid tubercle on the roof of the descending cornu. The structure may be seen in hardened sections, but the Author could never convince himself of its being visible in the brain on the dissecting room table. Gray, Ellis, Holden, and Heath never saw it; neither did Hirschfeld. The description is an example, to the Author's mind, of the importation of interpretational Anatomy into what purports to be dissectional Anatomy. * * As confirming- the view contended for, there have been placed side by side, p. 348t, the illustration? of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle given, on the one hand, by Hirschfeld, and, on the other, by Schwalbe. The interpretational anatomist, Schwalbe, introduces the amygdaloid tubercle, t.a. (on section only), which Hirschfeld does not show ; and he shows an " eminentia collateralis " quite different from what Hirschfeld represents, and such as the Author, certainly, has never seen.

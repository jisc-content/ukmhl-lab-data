338 ARTERIES of the BASE of the BRAIN. A.re the anterior & middle cerebral branches of the internal carotid and the posterioi cerebral of the basilar, which are joined together by the anterior & posterior communicating. Unterior Cerebral - Anterior & smaller of the branches of bifurcation of internal carotW opposite inner extremity of fissure of Sylvius. Forwards & inwards towards longitudinal fissure, being connected with each other bv Anterior Co:.imunicating, - A small branch about two lines in length. Round genu and along upper surface of corpus callosum, and join with posterior cero- bral. Give ofi" small branches to anterior perforated space and to inner & under surfaces of frontal lobe. Iblidd.le Cerebral-"^^^^ larger of the two terminal branches of internal carotid. Forwards & outwards along fissure of Sylvius, giving twigs to anterior perforatef^ space, and divides into branches to pia mater of frontal, parietal & temporo. sphenoidal lobes, and to central lobe or Island of Reil. - Sometimes gives off anterior choroid. Posterior Communicating - Very variable in size. From back part of internal carotid just before its bifurcation. I Backwards parallel to its fellow, and inosculates with posterior cerebral. % Posterior Cerebral-Two; terminal branches of basilar. Forwards and outwards for a short distance giving numerous branches to posterio* perforated space, and join posterior communicatiii|j. Backwards & outwards on crura cerebri in front of 3rd nerve, and, curving slightly inwards, divide into numerous branches to inner, under, & outer surfaces of occipital lobe. They give off the posterior choroid. CIRCLE OF WILLIS â€” is formed in front, laterally & behind respectively by: I Anterior cerebral arteries joined by the anterior communicating, H Trunks of internal carotids & posterior communicating, jB Posterior cerebral & basilar. ^ Within the circle of Willis are comprised from before backwards the laminfi oinerea, optio commissure, tuber cinereum with the infundibulum, corpora albicantia & posterior perforated apaow.

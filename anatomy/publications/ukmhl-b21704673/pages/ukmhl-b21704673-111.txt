79 FRONl' OF THE ARM The dissector has al- ready taken notice of the lacertus fibrosus, and has separated it artificially from the fascia brachii above, and from the fascia anti- brachii below. Observe now that it springs from the anterior margin of the tendon of the biceps brachii, and that it likewise receives some muscular fibres from the short head of the muscle. M. Brachialis (O.T. Brachialis Anticus).—The brachialis arises from the entire width of the anterior surface of the distal half of the body of the humerus, from the medial inter- muscular septum, and from a small part of the lateral intermuscular septum above the brachioradialis. The origin from the bone is prolonged upwards in two slips which partially embrace the insertion of the deltoid. The fibres converge to be inserted into the ba.se of the coro- noid process of the ulna by a short, thick tension. The muscle lies partly under cover of the biceps brachii, but projects be- yond it on either side. It is overlapped on its medial side by the pronator teres, and on the lateral side by t the brachioradialis and ex- Subscapularis Supraspinatus Latissinius dorsi Pectoralis major Teres major Deltoid Coraco'brachialis Brachioradialis Kxtensor carpi radjalis longus Kxlensors Pronator radii teres and flexors *'iG. 33.—Anterior aspect of Municrus with Muscular Attachments mapped out.

ABDOMEN 528 diaphragm, and in a backward direction from the anterior abdominal wall. This pressure and counterpressure, which produce so marked a con- formation of the anterior surface of the two kidneys, must also exercise an important influence in maintaining the organ in its place, and securing it in that part of the abdominal cavity in which it lies. Still it is doubtful if these influences have so potent an effect on the right as on the left side. The right kidney is embedded to a greater or less extent in the liver, and this no doubt exerts an influence in fixing the organ in position. Ligaments fixing the kidney to the abdominal wall are described, and it is easy to demonstrate that the extra-peritoneal tissue in which it lies becomes condensed in the regions above and below into obscure ligamentous lamellae, but it is doubtful if these can have much effect in maintaining the kidney in its place. Pancreas Bile-duct Fig. 204.—Section through Abdomen at the level of the second lumbar vertebra. Hilus of th.6 Kidney.—The medial border of each kidney presents a longitudinal fissure called the hilus, for the admission and egress of the vessels, nerves, lymph vessels, and duct (Fig. 209). This is bounded anteriorly and posteriorly by a thick lip, and leads into a deep recess or cavity in the kidney, which is termed the 7-enal sinus. The ureter and the renal vessels enter the kidney between the lips of the hilus. They will be found to have the following general position from before backwards: (i) branches of the renal vein; (2) branches of the renal artery ; (3) ureter or renal duct. Anterior Surface of the flight Kidney. — The anterior surface of the right kidney may present three impressions, viz. a hepatic, a colic, and a duodenal. The hepatic impression,

ABDOMEN 490 The Ileo-Csecal Orifice is an antero-posterior slit, bounded above and below by a protruding lip formed by the partial invagination of the lower end of the ileum into the csecum. The two lips are the two segments of the valve of the colo7i (O.T. ileo-cacal valve'). At the extremities of the orifice the segments of the valve unite together and become continuous with a ridge of the wall of the gut which is prolonged around the cavity. The anterior and posterior parts of the ridge, immediately adjacent to and connected with the lips of the valves, are spoken of as the frenula of the valve. The peritoneum and the longitudinal muscular bands are in no way involved in the infoldings which form the valve-flaps ; but the other Orifice of vermiform process' Upper segment- Lower segment- Fig. 189.â€”Ileo-Caecal Opening and Valve from a subject hardened by formalin injection (Birmingham.) constituents of the gut-wall (viz. the mucous membrane, the submucous coat, and the circular muscular fibres) take part in their formation. Villi are present on the ileal but not on the csecal aspect of each valve-flap. The function of this valve is obvious. It is so arranged that the free passage of materials from the ileum into the crecum is in no way impeded ; but when the csecum becomes distended, and there is, consequently, a tendency to regurgitation, the frenula of the valve are put upon the stretch and the free borders of the segments are brought into firm contact. In this way reflux of the contents of the csecum into the ileum is prevented, although it is well to note that the obliquity of the entrance of the ileum into the cmcum' also exercises a very important influence in the same direction. The position of the ileo-csecal orifice is marked on the anterior surface of the abdomen by the medial angle between the intertubercular and the right lateral lines. About an inch below the ileo-ctecal orifice, and on a posterior plane, is the

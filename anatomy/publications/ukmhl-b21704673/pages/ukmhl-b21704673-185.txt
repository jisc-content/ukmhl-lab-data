ARTICULATIONS 153 facets of the os naviculare and os lunatum, and a very small articular facet on the extreme lateral part of the proximal surface of the os triquetrum. Two interosseous ligaments stretch across the narrow intervals between these bones— one on either side of the os lunatum—and complete the carpal surface. Formed of these factors the carpal surface is convex in all directions. Further, it should be observed that the articular surface extends distally to a greater extent dorsally than on the volar aspect. The proxwial surface or socket (Fig. 61) is elongated from side to side, and concave in all directions. The greater part of it is formed by the distal end of the radius, but to the medial side of this by the discus articularis of the distal radio- Head of ulna Kiu. 61.—Carpal Articular Surfaces of the Radius and of the Discus .Articularis of the Wrist. ulnar joint likewise enters into its construction. The distal articular surface of the radius is divided by a low ridge into a lateral triangular and a medial quadrilateral facet. The lateral facet, in the ordinary position of the hand, is in contact with the greater extent of the proximal articular surface of the os naviculare. The medial facet of the radius, together with the discus articularis, forms a much larger surface, triangular in outline, which is opposed to the proximal articular surface of the os lunatum. When the hand is placed in line with the forearm no part of the proximal articular surface is allotted to the os triquetrum ; its small articular facet rests against the medial part of the capsule of the joint. When the hand is moved medially {i.e. adducted), however, the os triquetrum travels laterally, and its articular surface comes into contact with the distal

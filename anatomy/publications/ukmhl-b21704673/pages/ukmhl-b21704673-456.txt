ABDOMEN 424 however, other forms of inguinal hernia which do not pass through the abdominal inguinal ring but through the posterior wall of the canal to the medial side of the inferior epigastric artery, and between it and the obliterated part of the umbilical artery, or still more medially between the obliterated part of the umbilical artery and the lateral border of the rectus. Such herniae, because they do not pass obliquely along the inguinal canal but more directly through its posterior wall, are called by the surgeon direct inguinal hernire. As there are no congenital diverticula of the peritoneum in these regions such hernim must be due either to the slow distension of weak points in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, under the influence of the intra-abdominal pressure, or to the instant rupture of such points when the pressure is suddenly increased. After a pouch of the posterior wall, containing gut, has been protruded into the canal, or after a portion of the peritoneal sac containing gut has been forced through the posterior wall into the canal, the action of the abdominal pressure will tend to force the protrusion along the line of least resistance, which is usually down the canal to the subcutaneous inguinal ring. The coverings of the direct hernia will differ according to whether the hernia has torn the posterior wall or forced it forwards as a covering, and, in the latter case, according to whether the hernia has passed from the medial inguinal pouch between the inferior epigastric artery and the obliterated part of the umbilical arterj', or through the supravesical pouch to the medial side of the obliterated artery. The coverings of the hernia passing from the medial inguinal pouch will be the same as those of the oblique hernia, except that transversalis fascia will take the place of infundibuliform fascia ; but if the hernia passes from the supravesical pouch, to the medial side of the obliterated part of the um- bilical artery, it will push before it the falx inguinalis, it will enter the canal below the upper border of the cremasteric fascia, and it will receive no sheath from the latter fascia, from within outwards, therefore its anatomical coverings will be—(i) peritoneum, (2) extra-peritoneal fat, (3) transversalis fascia, (4) falx inguinalis, (5) intercrural fascia, (6) superficial fascia, (7) skin. The student should also understand that whilst it is commonly believed that oblique herniae are usually due to the persistence of a portion of the processus vaginalis there is no anatomical reason why a new peritoneal sac should not be formed in the region of the lateral inguinal fossa, that is in the region of the abdominal inguinal ring, as easily as in other regions. If such a pouch were formed it would pass along the line of the canal, its coverings would be similar to those of a hernia which had passed into the upper persisting part of the processus vaginalis, and its relationship to the tunica vaginalis would depend largely upon the size of the latter sac, that is upon how much of the lower part of the original processus remained un- obliterated, and upon the more anterior or posterior position of the upper end of the tunica vaginalis. Femoral Hernia.—This consists in the protrusion of some abdominal contents from the abdominal cavity into the region of the thigh. In its descent it passes behind the inguinal ligament along the femoral canal of the femoral sheath. It is consequently mainly the duty of the student who is engaged in the dissection of the lower limb, and within whose domain the femoral sheath lies, to investigate the anatomical connections of this variety of hernia (p. 185). Still it is essential that the dissector of the abdomen should examine, from its abdominal aspect, the femoral ring or aperture of communication between the femoral canal and the abdominal cavity, and give the dissector of the lower limb an opportunity of doing so likewise. The femoral ring is placed immediately below the inguinal ligament, in the interval between the external iliac vein and the base of the lacunar

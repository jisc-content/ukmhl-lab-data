361 MALE PERINEUM sisting of a pelvic^ a glutceal, and a perineal part. The perineal or third part of the pudendal artery enters the perineum by passing through the small sciatic foramen. At first it is placed deeply; but it is found to become more superficial, as it is traced forwards, and at the same time to incline medially, so that, at its termination, it lies close to the middle line of the body.

It lies fully an inch and a half above the level of the lowest part of the ischial tuberosity, and is accompanied by two veins and the two divisions of the pudendal nerve. Of the latter the dorsal nerve of the penis lies above it and the perineal nerve below it. Reaching the base of the urethral triangle, the pudendal artery insinuates itself between the two fasciae of the uro- genital diaphragm, and, gradually emerging from under cover of the bone, proceeds forwards along the edge of the pubic

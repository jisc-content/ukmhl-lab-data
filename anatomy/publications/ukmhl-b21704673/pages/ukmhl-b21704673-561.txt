ABDOMINAL CAVITY which indicates the area of contact with the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, occupies almost the whole of the upper two-thirds of the anterior surface, and corresponds to the upper inclined plane. Over this district the kidney is some- times sunk deeply into the liver. The right suprarenal gland, which rests, as a rule, on the upper extremity of the right kidney, extends downwards, for a very short distance, on the anterior surface of the organ between it and the liver. With the exception of this narrow strip, immediately adjoining the Fig. 205.—Right Kidney and Duodenum. superior extremity, the hepatic impression on the anterior surface of the kidney is covered by peritoneum. The colic impression correspcftids to the inferior inclined plane, and sometimes it exhibits a marked degree of obliquity. The right colic flexure and the commencement of the transverse colon are in contact with this area. The posterior surfaces of these portions of great intestine are devoid of peritoneum, and bound to the kidney by areolar tissue. The duodenal impression, or area of contact with the second part of the duodenum, is in the neighbourhood of the hilus, and varies greatly both in position and extent (Fig. 205).

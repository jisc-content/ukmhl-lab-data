587 PELVIS VE RTCX it is separated by the recto-vesical fascia, the deferent ducts and seminal vesicles which are enclosed in the fascia, and the peritoneum of the anterior wall of the recto-vesical excavation. The apex is placed in relation with the upper part of the symphysis pubis. It is continuous with a strong fibrous cord, the ligamentum umbilicale medium {urachus), which proceeds upwards, on the posterior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall, to the umbilicus. The urachus is the re- mains of the intra-abdominal part of the allantoic diverticulum from the hind-gut of the embryo. The superior surface looks upwards and backwards, and is completely covered by peri- toneum. It supports some coils of small intestine and, as a rule, a coil of the pelvic colon. It is slightly convex; it is tri- angular in outline, and is bounded by three borders, viz.— two lateral, which diverge from the apex, and a pos- terior, which separates it from the base. The lateral and pos- terior borders meet at the lateral angles, and at these angles the ureters enter the bladder wall. Each lateral border is in relation with the side wall of the pelvis, along a line considerably ureter ureter Fig. 233.—Diagram of the Under Surface of the Empty Bladder. (After A. F. Dixon.) below the level of the deferent ducts and the umbilical artery. The infero-lateral surfaces are separated from each other by a rounded anterior border. Each infero-lateral surface forms part of the posterior wall of the cave of Retzius, and is separated by extra-peritoneal fat from the back of the ! body of the pubic bone and the fascia covering the pelvic surfaces of the obturator internus and the levator ani muscles. The anterior border, which separates the infero-lateral sur- faces, lies behind the symphysis and in front of the prostate, b It extends downwards and backwards to the internal urethral

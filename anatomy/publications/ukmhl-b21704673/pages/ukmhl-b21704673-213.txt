Medially, it has a double attach- ment, viz.—(i) to the pubic tubercle, (2) through the medium of the lig. lacunare to the medial part of the pecten pubis (O.T. ilio-pectineal line). The inguinal ligament pursues an oblique course between its iliac and pubic attachments, and at the same time describes a gentle curve, the convexity of Sheath of rectus Aponeurosis of external oblique Intercrural fibres Inguinal ligament (Poupart’s) Subcutaneous abdominal ring Lig. inguinale reflexum Lig. lacunare (Gimbernat’s) Fig. 68.—Dissection to show the connections of the Inguinal Ligament. which is turned distally. By its distal border it affords attachment to the fascia lata, and when this is divided it loses its curved direction. The ligamentum lactmare (O.T. Gimbernat’s) is a small triangular pieceof aponeuroticfasciawhich occupies the interval between the medial part of the inguinal ligament and the medial inch of the pecten pubis—being attached by its margins to both. Its base, which looks laterally, is sharp, crescentic, and free, and abuts against the femoral sheath. The lacunar ligament occupies a very oblique plane; its femoral surface 1—12 6

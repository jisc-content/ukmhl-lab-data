The intermediate part of the palmar aponeurosis h.as been left in position whilst the lateral and medial portions have been removed to display the short museles of the thumb and little finger. digital vessels and nerves, together with the lumbrical nuuscles, appear in the intervals between the slips into which the jialmar aponeurosis divides. These should be defined, and it will be seen that they jiass distally under cover of the superficial transverse ligament. Having noted this point.

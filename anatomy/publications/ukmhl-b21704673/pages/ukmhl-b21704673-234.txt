INFERIOR EXTREMITY 202 anterior part of this head ; the posterior part will be seen in the dissection of the glutseal region. The two heads of origin of the rectus femoris join at a right angle, immediately beyond the margin of the acetabulum, and form a strong flattened tendon, which gives place to a fusiform, fleshy belly. The tendon of origin spreads out on the anterior surface of the proximal part of the muscle in the form of an aponeurosis. About three inches proximal to the knee-joint the rectus femoris ends in a strong tendon of Its surface is covered by a glistening aponeurosis. The descending branch of the lateral circumflex artery constitutes the best guide to its anterior border, and when this margin is raised it will be seen that the muscle lies upon, and is partially blended with, the vastus intermedius. The vastus lateralis arisesâ€”(i) from the proximal part of the linea intertrochanterica; (2) from the front of the trochanter major, distal to the insertion of the gluta;us minimus; (3) from the root of the trochanter major below the insertion of the glutasus medius; (4) from the lateral part of the glutEEal tuberosity anterior to the insertion of the gluta;us M. insertion, which is prolonged for some distance proximally, on its deep surface, in the form of an aponeurosis. As it nears the patella this tendon is joined by the other tendons of the quadriceps, and through the :. iiio-psoas medium of a com- mon tendon finds insertion into the proximal border of that bone. The rectus femoris is supplied by the femoral 7ierve. M. Vastus Lateralis (O.T. the lateral side of the thigh.

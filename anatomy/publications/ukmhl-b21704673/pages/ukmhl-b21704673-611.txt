579 PELVIS where some are large enough to catch the point of a small catheter or bougie. Direction of the Urethral Canal.—The prostatic portion is directed downwards and very slightly forwards. The membranous part describes a gentle curve behind the sym- physis. The concavity of the curve looks forwards and upwards. The cavernous part first ascends, then curves down- wards. The urethra, therefore, in the flaccid condition of the penis, takes a course in which there are two curves, like the letter 03 placed on its side. When the penis is raised towards the front of the abdomen the curve in the cavernous Urethra Corpus cavernosuni urethrae Dorsal vein of penis Fibrous capsule of corpus cavernosum penis Dorsal artery Unreal nerve Fibrous capsule of corpus cavernosum penis Corpus cavernosum pen* Septum penis Arter>’ to corpus cavernosum penis Erectile tissue of corpus cavernosum penis Fig. 227.—Transverse section through the anterior part of the body of the Penis. part of the canal is obliterated, and there is then only one curve, the concavity of which is directed upwards. Dissection.—The cor[>orus cavernosum penis was separated into two parts by the incision which opened the urethra. Transverse incisions should now be made through each part. Structure of the Penis.—The corpus cavernosum penis consists of a mass of erectile tissue surrounded by a strong fibro-elastic sheath, the tunica albuginea. It is more or less completely separated into two lateral halves by a median septum connected with the internal surface of the sheath. This septum receives the name of septum penis, and it is frequently termed the septum pectiniforme because, in front, it is very imperfect, being broken up by vertical slits into a

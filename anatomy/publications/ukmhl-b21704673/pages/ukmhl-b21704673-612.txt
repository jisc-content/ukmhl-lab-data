580 ABDOMEN number of processes like the teeth of a comb. Fibrous lamellae and bands proceed from the deep surface of the sheath and join together to form a spongy framework. The interstices of this framework communicate freely with each other and are filled with venous blood. By squeezing the corpus cavernosum under the tap and washing out the blood some idea of the trabeculae may be obtained. The corpus cavernosum urethrae has a similar structure. The enclosing sheath, however, is very delicate, and the trabeculae are much finer. Fig. 228.—Medial section through terminal part of the Penis : Prepuce extremely short. Dissection.—Divide the peritoneum along the junction of the superior surface with the fundus of the bladder, and extend the incision to the lateral wall of the pelvis to separate each lateral false ligament from the peritoneum posterior to it. Next divide the peritoneum in the medial plane on the superior surface of the bladder and then divide the superior and posterior walls of the viscus in the median plane. After the division is completed dissect the fundus of the bladder from the deferent ducts and the seminal vesicles, taking care not to injure the ureters as they enter the bladder wall. When the separation is completed note the relations of the bladder and ureters to the more posterior structures. In the median plane there may be a slight interval be- tween the deferent ducts in which the rectum is separated from the bladder wall merely by the recto-vesical fascia ; this interval, if it is present, corresponds to the middle and back part of the trigone of the bladder. On each side of it the deferent duct and the seminal vesicle separate the bladder Fibrous capsule of the Prepuce Corpus cavernosum - penis Offsets from capsule l Corpus cavernosum urethrae

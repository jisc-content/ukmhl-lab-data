Finally it leaves the forearm by passing be- hind the transverse carpal ligament. A small artery, the a. mediana^ a branch of the volar interosseous artery, accompanies the median nerve. Sometimes this vessel attains a considerable size. As the median nerve enters the forearm it gives off numerous branches for the supply of muscles, and near the wrist it supplies a ravius palmaris, which has already been dissected (p. 95)- The jnuscular branches supply all the muscles of the superficial group, therefore, with the single exception of the flexor carpi ulnaris ; viz. the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, and the flexor digi- torum sublimis. It likewise supplies a long slender twig—volar in- terosseous nerve—which goes to the deep muscles on the anterior aspect of the fore- arm. Fig. 43.—Anterior aspect of Bones of Forearm with Muscular Attachments mapped out. Deep Structures on the front of the Forearm. — The connections of the deep muscles must now be studied, and at the same time the volar interosseous artery and volar interosse- ous nerve must be followed. The flexor digitorum pro- fundus is the large muscle which clothes the volar and

THE UPPER EXTREMITY 24 in its distal half. This is due to the fact that the posterior wall of the axilla extends more distally than the anterior wall. Whilst, therefore, it is covered in its proximal half by the pectoralis major, below this it is only covered by the skin and fascia. Behind it proximo-distally are the subscapularis, the tendon of the latissimus dorsi, and the teres major, but it is separated from the subscapularis muscle by the axillary (circumflex) and radial (musculo- spiral) nerves, and from the latissimus dorsi and the teres (musculo-spiral) Fig. IX.—Diagram to show relation of Axillary Vessels and Nerves. major by the radial nerve. To its lateral side is the coraco- brachialis muscle, but between the muscle and the artery are the musculo-cutaneous and the median nerves. To the medial side of the artery is the vein with the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm in the angle between the artery and vein anteriorly, and the ulnar nerve in the angle between the artery and vein posteriorly. The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm lies along the medial side of the vein. The branches of the axillary artery have been seen at different stages of the dissection. They may now be more fully examined. They are :— Kaclial nerve Ulnar nerve

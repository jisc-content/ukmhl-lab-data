Through this aperture an exten- sive protrusion of the synovial membrane takes place in the form of a bursa mucosa, which, from its position under the upper part of the subscapularis muscle, receives the name of the bursa subscapularis. It is important to note the position and character of this opening, seeing that in some cases the head of the bone may be driven through it in dislocation of the joint. The second apcTiure is smaller and more distinctly defined. It is placed between the two tubercles of the Coraco-acromial ligament Acromion process Coracoid process Coraco-humeral ligament Communication between joint- cavity and sub- scapular bursa Subscapularis muscle I.ong tendon of biceps brachii Capsule of joint Fig. 39.â€”Shoulder-joint as seen from the front. humerus, at the proximal part of the sulcus intertubercularis, and it is through this that the long tendinous head of the biceps brachii gains admission to the interior of the capsule. The synovial membrane akso protrudes from this opening, and lines the sulcus intertubercularis as low as the in- sertion of the pcctoralis major. It is not often that the third opening is seen. It is situated, when present, on the lateral or posterior aspect of the capsule, and allows a pocket of synovial membrane to bulge out in the form of a bursa under the infraspinatus muscle. At certain points the capsule of the shoulder-joint is

553 ABDOMINAL CAVITY view by piercing the transversus abdominis muscle a little way in front of the ilio-hypogastric. It is distributed to the integument of the scrotum and the medial aspect of the proximal part of the thigh (pp. 174 and 394). The nerviis genito-femoralis (O.T. genito-crural nerve) is directed forwards through the psoas, and, appearing upon its anterior aspect, ends by dividing into a lumbo-inguinal, and an external spermatic branch. The external sperfuatic branch proceeds downwards and medially. It crosses the external iliac artery obliquely, and reaches the abdominal inguinal Lateral cutaneous Iliacus Twelfth Last thoracic nerve I IHo-inguinal Genito-femoral Quadratus lumborum Femoral Luinbo'sacral cord Ilio-hypogastric Ilio-inguinal Genito-femoral Lateral cutaneous — Femoral Obturator Lumbo-sacral cord Fig. 213.—The Lumbar Ple.vus (semi-diagrammatic). ring. There it comes into relation with the constituents of the spermatic cord, and, leaving the abdomen, is distributed to the cremaster muscle. In the female this branch is very small, and ends in the round ligament of the uterus and the labium pudendi. The lumbo-inguinal branch runs downwards along the lateral side of the external iliac artery, and, crossing the deep circumflex iliac artery, passes behind the inguinal ligament. It supplies a limited portion of the skin on the front of the thigh. d'he 71. cutatieus femoris lateralis (O.'I'. e.xternai cutaneous nerve) emerges from the lateral border of the psoas about

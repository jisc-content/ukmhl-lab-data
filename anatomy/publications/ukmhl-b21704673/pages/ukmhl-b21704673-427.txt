ABDOMINAI. WALL 395 M. Transversus Abdominis (O.T. Transversalis Muscle). —This is the deepest of the three muscular strata which enter into the formation of the wall of the abdomen. It has a threefold origin — viz. from the pelvis, from the vertebral column, and from the costal cartilages. By its pelvic origin it is attached to the lateral third of the inguinal ligament and to the anterior two-thirds of the medial lip of the crest of the ilium; by its costal origin it arises from the inner surfaces of the costal cartilages of the lower six ribs, by a series of slips or digitations which interdigitate with the slips of origin of Psoas magnus Quadratus lumborum Sacrospinalis F'ascia transversalis External oblique Internal oblique Transversus abdominis Latissimus dorsi Serratiis post. inf. Fig. 148.—Lumbar fascia and sheath of Rectus abdominis. The dotted line represents the Peritoneum. the diaphragm ; by its vertebral origin it is attached, through the medium of the lumbar fascia, to the spinous processes, and the tips and roots of the transverse processes, of the lumbar vertebrre. In point of fact, the lumbar fascia constitutes the posterior aponeurosis of this muscle. But the manner in which this fascia is attached to the vertebrre requires further explanation. As it approaches the spine it splits into three layers or lamellae; of these the posterior lamella is attached to the tips of the spinous processes, the anterior la7nella to the roots of the transverse processes, and the intermediate latnella to the tips and adjacent sides of the transverse processes. Two aponeurotic compartments are thus formed.

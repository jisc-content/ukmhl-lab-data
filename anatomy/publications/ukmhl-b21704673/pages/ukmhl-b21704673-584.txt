552 ABDOMEN nerve. But other branches come off from certain of these divisions. Thus, the lower root of the genito-femoral springs from the anterior division of the second lumbar nerve, whilst the two roots of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh take origin from the posterior divisions of the second and third lumbar trunks. The ilio-hypogastric nerve emerges from the lateral border of the psoas, and crosses the quadratus lumborum obliquely.

Reaching the crest of the ilium, it leaves the abdomen by piercing the transversus abdominis muscle. Its further course has already been studied (p. 394). It gives off an iliac bra7ich to the skin of the glutfeal region, and a hypogastric brattch to the skin over the lower part of the abdominal wall. The ilio-itiguinal nerve is smaller than the ilio-hypogastric, and leaves the psoas almost at the same point. It runs obliquely downwards and laterally over the quadratus lum- borum and the upper part of the iliacus, and disappears from

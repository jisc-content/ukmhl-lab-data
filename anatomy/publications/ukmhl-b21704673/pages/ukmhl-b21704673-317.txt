THE LEG 285 M. soleus knee. There it will be observed to be semimembranosus continuous with the tendon of the semi- membranosus, and through it, therefore, the semimembranosus may be regarded as having an insertion into the linea poplitea of the tibia. The flexor hallitcis Io7igiis is placed upon the posterior aspect of the fibula, and its tendon will be noticed grooving the posterior border of the talus as it passes forwards to gain the sole of the foot. The flexor digitorum longus lies upon the tibia. The tibialis posterior rests upon the interosseous membrane upon a deeper plane and between the fleshy bellies of the two flexors. Aponeurosis covering the Tibialis Posterior. — This con- stitutes the second partition which crosses the posterior osteo-fascial compartment of the leg. It is a strong aponeurosis, which is at- tached on the one hand to the medial border of the fibula, and on the other to the vertical ridge which descends from the linea poplitea on the posterior surface of the tibia. To demonstrate these attachments, the flexor muscle of the toes must be pushed medially and some of its fibres divided. The flexor hallucis longus must in like manner be pushed laterally. The aponeur- osis will then be seen to serve as a surface of origin for both of ^°4 these muscles; and, on its removal, it will also be observed to give fibres, by its deep surface, to the subjacent tibialis posterior.

THE UPPER EXTREMITY 15° attached above to the distal and dorsal part of the medial epi- condyle, whilst distally it is fixed to the medial border of the olecranon. The tratisverse part consists of a band of fibres, which bridges across the notch between the olecranon and coronoid process, to both of which it is attached. The lig. annulare and the chorda obliqua will be described later (see pp. 155-157)- Stratum Synoviale (Synovial Membrane).—The joint should be opened by making a transverse incision through the Interosseous membrane Medial epi- condyle Anterior part of ulnar collateral ligament Posterior part of ulnar collateral ligament Olecranon Ulna Transverse part of ulnar collateral ligament Radius Coronoid Fig. 59.—Medial aspect of Elbow-joint. anterior part of the capsule. The stratum synoviale will be seen lining the deep surface of the capsule, from, which it is reflected upon the non-articular parts of the bones which are enclosed within the capsule. Anterior to the humerus it lines the radial and coronoid fossae, and posteriorly it is prolonged proximally in the form of a loose diverticulum into the olecranon fossa. In these fossae a quantity of soft oily fat is developed between the bone and the stratum synoviale. In this way pliable pads are formed which occupy the recesses when the bony processes are withdrawn from them. Distally the synovial membrane of the elbow-joint is

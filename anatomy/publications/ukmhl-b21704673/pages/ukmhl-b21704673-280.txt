INFERIOR EXTREMITY 248 the head, but the posterior slip gives an aponeurotic extension to the fascia of the leg, whilst the anterior part gives off a slip (in some cases strong, but generally feeble) to the adjacent part of the lateral condyle of the tibia. M. Semitendinosus.—This muscle arises from the medial impression on the proximal part of the tuberosity of the ischium by a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps femoris, and also by fleshy fibres directly from the bone (Fig. 74, p. 200). A narrow, tendinous intersection appears on the posterior surface of the muscle about the Fig. 92.—Anterior aspect of Proximal Portions of Bones of Leg with Attachments of Muscles mapped out. middle of the thigh, and is directed obliquely distally and laterally. The muscular belly ends, in the distal third of the thigh, in a long cylindrical tendon which passes distally on the semimembranosus muscle. On the medial side of the knee the tendon bends anteriorly, crosses the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint, and, becoming flattened, is inserted into the proximal part of the medial surface of the body of the tibia, near the anterior crest of that bone and immedi- ately distal to the tendon of the gracilis. From its distal border aponeurotic fibres pass into the deep fascia of the leg; its proximal border is adherent to the gracilis for about half an inch from its insertion, and both tendons are concealed by the Lig. coUat. fibular M. biceps femori M. semitendinosus

SOLE OF THE FOOT 299 all the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus into connection with the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus. The musculus quadratics plantic which is inserted into the tendon of the long flexor of the toes, and also the four lumbrical muscles which arise from the flexor tendons, can now be distinguished. Note the position of the long plantar ligament between the two heads of origin of the quadratus plantae. Fibrous Flexor Sheaths. —Before tracing the flexor tendons forwards on the toes, it is necessary to ex- amine the sheaths which retain them upon the plantar aspect of the phalanges. In their con- struction these fibrous sheaths are precisely simi- lar to the corresponding sheaths of the fingers. They are not so strongly marked, but they present the same thickenings over the shafts of the phalanges and the same want of strength opposite the inter- phalangeal joints. They may now be opened in order that the enclosed tendons may be examined. A mucous sheath is present in each to facilitate the play of the flexor tendons within them (see p. 123). Insertions of the Flexor Tendons. — Two tendons, one from the flexor digitorum brevis and one from the flexor digitorum longus, enter the flexor sheath of each of the four lateral toes. Of these, the tendon of the former muscle corresponds with a tendon of the flexor sublimis in the hand, whilst the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus corresponds with a tendon of the flexor profundus. Further, they are inserted in exactly the same manner. The tendon of the flexor brevis, which is the more superficial, divides into two Calcaneus ••• F'lexor hallucis longus Flexor digitorum longus Quadratus plantae (O.T. accessorius) Lumbricals Fio. 109.—Second layer of Muscles and 'I endons in the Sole of the Foot.

589 PELVIS As the bladder fills its superior wall is raised from the fundus and infero-lateral walls. All its surfaces are increased in area, and the borders, which in the empty bladder inter- vene between them, become rounded off and finally obliterated. The organ thus becomes oval in form, and the walls, which are thick and firm in the contracted state, become com- Rectu-= abdominis Retro-pubic pad of fat Corpus cavernosu penis l^ulbo-cavernosiis Peritoneum Ductus deferens Prostate Sphincter ni externus ani imernus Hulb of urethra Sphincter uni externus Fig. 235. â€” Medial section through the Pelvis of an Adult Male.

The apex appears above the symphysis pubis, and, as distension goes on, the organ rises higher and higher into the hypogastric region until a considerable extent of its wall becomes applied to the abdominal wall above the pubis. The infero-lateral surfaces of the distending bladder encroach on the paravesical fosste, and finally obliterate them, thus coming into contact with a greater extent of the lateral walls of the pelvis. When the bladder is excessively distended it assumes a Li

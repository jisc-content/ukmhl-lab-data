ABDOMEN 620 The following structures lie in the wall of the pelvis outside the pelvic fascia :— Blood-vessels. Nerves. The middle sacral vessels. The parietal branches of the hypogastric vessels after they have pierced the fascia. The sacral and sacro-coccygeal plexuses. The pelvic parts of the sympathetic cords. General Position of the Viscera.—pelvic colon lies in the hinder and upper part of the cavity, and its loops tend to ^ overlap the other viscera. ' ' - " The rectum occupies the lower and posterior part of the cavity, and is adapted to the concavity of the sacrum and coccyx. The bladder and urethra are situated in front, the former lying against the bodies of the pubic bones. The uterus and vagina occupy an intermediate position; and the, uterine appendages lie laterally between the uterus and the side walls of the pelvis. Peritoneum.—As the peri- toneum descends from the posterior abdominal wall into the pelvis, it gives a complete covering to the pelvic colon and attaches it to the anterior surface of the sacrum by a pelvic meso-colon. At a lower level it gives a partial cover- ing to the rectum, first clothing it on its anterior and lateral surfaces, then on its anterior surface alone. Finally, it quits the gut about three inches above the level of the anus, and is reflected on to the upper part of the posterior wall of the vagina, upon which it ascends to the uterus. It covers the whole of the supra-vaginal portion of the posterior surface of the uteru.s, and reaching the fundus turns over and descends on the anterior surface of Fig. 245.—Horizontal section through the Urethra, Vagina, and Anal Canal, a short distance above their termina- tions.

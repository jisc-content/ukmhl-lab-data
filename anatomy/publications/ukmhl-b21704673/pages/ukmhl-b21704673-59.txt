Its other tributaries correspond, more or less closely, to the branches of the axillary artery. M. Subclavius.—The subclavius is a small muscle which lies immediately below the clavicle enclosed between the two layers of the costo-coracoid membrane. It takes origin by a short rounded tendon from the superior surface of the first costal arch, at the junction of the bone with the cartilage, and the fleshy belly is inserted into the shallow groove on the inferior surface of the clavicle. The nerve of Joint capsule Joint ca Fig. 12.—.Stcnio-clavicular and Costo-slernal Joints. supply is derived from the fifth cervical nerve and enters the posterior surface of the muscle. When the muscle contracts it depresses the clavicle and draws it slightly forwards. Dissection.—When the subclavius has been examined it must be divided horizontally, and when this has been done the costo-clavicular ligament will be found behind the medial end of the muscle. The clavicle must now be detached from the sternum and the cartil.age of the first rib, and turned laterally so that the brachial plexus may be properly examined, but before this is done the sterno clavicular joint should be studied. With the assistance of the dissector of the head and neck the clavicular part of the sterno-cleidomastoideus muscle must be

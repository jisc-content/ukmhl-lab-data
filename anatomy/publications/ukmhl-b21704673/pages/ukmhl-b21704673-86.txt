54 THE UPPER EXTREMITY Dissection. —The branches of the posterior circumflex artery of the humerus and the axillary nerve should now be dissected out on the deep surface of the deltoid muscle. Arterise Circumflexae Humeri (O.T. Circumflex Arteries).— The atieria circutnflexa hutneri posterior has been already observed to arise within the axilla from the posterior aspect of the axillary artery a short distance distal to the subscapular branch. It at once proceeds backwards, through the quadri- lateral space, and, winding round the surgical neck of the humerus, it is distributed in numerous branches to the deep surface of the deltoid muscle. Several twigs are also given to the shoulder-joint and the integument. It anastomoses with II. Transverse section of the humerus immediately be- low the tuberosities. A.A. Axillary artery. P.C.

The termination of the arteria ciraanflexa hunien anterior can now be more satisfactorily studied, and its anastomosis with the art. circumflexa humeri posterior established if the injection has flowed well. By this anastomosis the arterial ring which encircles the proximal part of the humerus is completed. Nervus Axillaris (O.'P. Circumflex Nerve).—'Phis nerve accompanies the posterior circumflex artery, and supplies— (^^) muscular branches to the deltoid and teres minor; {l>) cutaneous branches to the skin over the distal pait of the deltoid ; and {c) an articular twig to the shoulder-joint.

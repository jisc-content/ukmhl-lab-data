ABDOMEN 4o8 traced as far as the testis, but more commonly it only extends down the cord for a short distance; indeed it is frequently absent. To obtain a proper conception of this fibrous thread, it is necessary that the student should understand that neither the testis nor the tunica vaginalis are developed in the scrotum. In the early months of foetal life the rudimentary scrotum is devoid both of tunica vaginalis and testis, and Fig. 152. â€” Diagrams illustrating the descent of the Testis and the deriva- tion of the tunica vaginalis from the peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity. the testis lies on the posterior wall of the abdomen projecting forwards into the great serous cavity of the abdomen which is called the peritoneal cavity. The wall of the peritoneal cavity is formed by a membrane called the peritoneum, and the inner surface of the membrane is lined by a layer of flat epithelium, peritoneal epithelium. The peritoneum which is in contact, externally, with the general muscular wall of the abdomen is called the parietal peritoneum ; but here and there the posterior wall of the peritoneal sac is invaginated by one or other of the abdominal viscera. When the invaginating viscus carries forward more peritoneum than is necessary to cover its surface the excess of peritoneum forms a fold which connects the viscus with the posterior wall of the abdomen ; such folds are called mesenteries and they connect the peritoneum covering the invaginat- ing viscus, which is termed the visceral peritoneum, with the parietal

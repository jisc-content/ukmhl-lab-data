184 INFERIOR EXTREMITY funnel-shaped prolongation of the lining. This, then, is the femoral sheath, and the dissector will now readily understand that the miterior wall of the sheath is formed of fascia transversalis from the anterior wall of the abdomen above the inguinal ligament, while the posterior wall is formed of fascia iliaca, prolonged downwards from the posterior abdominal wall. Posterior Wall of the Femoral Sheath.—There are still Fig. 69.—Dissection to show the Femoral Sheath and the otlrer Structures which pass between the Inguinal Ligament and the Innominate Bone. some additional facts relating to the posterior wall of the femoral sheath which require to be mentioned. It is formed, as stated above, by the fascia iliaca; but as this enters the thigh it blends with the fascia pectinea, and further, it is firmly fixed in position by certain connections which it establishes in the thigh. Thus beyond the femoral sheath it is prolonged laterally over the ilio-psoas muscle, whilst from its posterior aspect a lamina is given off which passes posterior to that muscle and joins the capsule of the hip-joint.

THE UPPER EXTREMITY 72 ridge, and extends up the arm as high as the insertion of the deltoid. The dissector should note that these septa divide the arm into an anterior and a posterior osteo-fascial compartment. Structures in the Anterior Compartment.—The anterior osteo-fascial compartment of the arm has been opened into by the reflection of the front part of the fascia brachii. The three muscles which specially belong to this region are the biceps brachii, brachialis, and the coraco-brachialis. The Fig. 30.—Transverse section through the Distal Third of the Right Arm. biceps brachii is the most superficial muscle: under cover of it, and closely applied to the anterior aspect of the humerus, is the brachialis; whilst the coraco-brachialis is the slender muscular belly which lies along the medial side of the biceps in its upper part. But, in addition, two muscles of the fore- arm will be observed extending upwards into this compartment of the arm, to seek origin from the lateral epicondylar ridge of the humerus : they are the brachioradialis and the extensor carpi radialis longus. They are closely applied to the lateral side of the brachialis. The brachial artery, with its vence comites, extends through the region in relation to the medial margin of the biceps brachii, and all the terminal branches of the

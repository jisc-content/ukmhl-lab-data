ABDOMEN 502 Immediately adjoining the neck a smooth rounded prominence projects upwards and forwards from the junction of the anterior surface and the upper border, above and to the left of the lower part of the small curvature of the stomach. This process is the tuber onmitale (His). It abuts against the lesser omentum which separates it from the omental tubercle of the liver. The inferior surface of the body of the pancreas looks downwards and rests upon the duodeno-jejunal flexure, the coils of the small intestine, and the trans- verse colon close to the splenic flexure. It is completely covered by the peritoneum, which forms the posterior layer of Fig. 192.â€”Dissection of Pancreas from behind to show its Ducts. (Birmingham.) the transverse meso-colon, and varies greatly in extent, the variation being due to the varying degrees of intestinal pressure to which the pancreas is subjected from below. The gastric pressure exerted on the pancreas from above, and the counter- pressure which is exerted by the intestine on the inferior surface of the organ from below, varying, as they do in the same individual, according to the condition of these hollow viscera, determine, in a great measure, the shape of the body of the pancreas. The body of the pancreas has the appearance of being wedged in between the two layers of the transverse meso-colon at its root. The splenic artery pursues a wavy course along the superior border of the pancreas, whilst the transverse meso-colon is attached to its anterior border. The tail of the pancreas abuts against the visceral aspect of the spleen, and usually rests upon a small depression on the

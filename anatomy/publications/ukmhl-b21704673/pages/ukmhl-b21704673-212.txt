18o INFERIOR EXTREMITY the cavity of the knee-joint. (5) The subcutaneous infra- patellar bursa, placed directly beneath the skin anterior to the proximal part of the ligamentum patella. (6) The deep infi-a- patellar bursa, which is placed between the ligamentum patellfe and the anterior surface of the proximal part of the tibia. The suprapatellar bursa and the deep infrapatellar burste are practically always present, but one or more of the subcutaneous and subfascial burste may be absent. Not un- commonly a subfascial and an adjacent subcutaneous bursa may communicate through an aperture in the deep fascia. The subcutaneous bursae are often destroyed during the reflection of the skin, but the deeper bursm can usually be found, if looked for carefully, in the situations mentioned above. Deep Dissection of the Thigh In this dissection the following parts require to be examined:— 1. 2. 3- 4- 5- 6. 7- 8. 9- 10. 11. 12. 13- The femoral sheath. Nervus lumboinguinalis. Nervus cutaneus femoris lateralis. M. sartorius. Nervus femoralis and its rami. Arteria femoralis and its rami. Vena femoralis. M. ilio-psoas. M. quadriceps femoris 1 Musculus rectus femoris. Musculus vastus lateralis. Musculus vastus intermedins. Musculus vastus lateralis. M. articularis genu. M. tensor fascite latm. Deep part of the tractus ilio-tibialis fascire latm. Intermuscular septa, lateral and medial. Ligament Inguinale (O.T. Poupart’s Ligament)— Liga- mentum Lacunare (O.T. Gimbernat’s Ligament).—Although, properly speaking, both of these ligaments belong more to the abdominal wall than the thigh, it is essential that the dissector should obtain some knowledge of their connections before he proceeds further with the dissection. The inguinal ligament is merely the thickened lower border of the apo- neurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdominal wall folded backwards upon itself. It thus presents a rounded surface towards the thigh, and a grooved surface towards the

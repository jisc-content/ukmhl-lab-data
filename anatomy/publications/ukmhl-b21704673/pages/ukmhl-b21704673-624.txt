592 ABDOMEN relation to the bladder, but to the entire bladder, with the reflection, being pushed upwards and forwards by the ex- panding gut. In the new-born infant the bladder differs both in form and position from the bladder of the adult. It is more or less pyriform, the narrow end passing into the urethra, and there is little or no appearance of a basal portion (Fig. 237). Further, it is placed very much higher. The internal urethral orifice is at the level of the upper border of the symphysis pubis, and the anterior surface of the organ is uncovered by peritoneum, and lies in direct contact with the abdominal wall (Symington). As growth goes on the urethral orifice sinks rapidly from the period of birth up to the fourth year, and Fig. 237.—Medial section through Pelvis of a newly-born full-time Male Infant. R. Rectum. Sa.

Then it remains stationary till puberty, after which it sinks slowly till it attains its normal adult position (Disse). It should also be noted that the recto-vesical re- flection of peritoneum, in the infant at birth, is at the level of the base of the prostate. [ Ureters.—Having crossed the lower end of the common | iliac artery, or the upper end of the external iliac artery, at the j brim of the small pelvis, the ureter descends, along the front of ' the hypogastric artery and its anterior division, till the level of the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia is reached, i.e. the level of the spine of the ischium. It then turns medially and forwards on the upper surface of the visceral fascia. In this part of its course it passes deep to the deferent duct, pierces the vesical layer of the visceral fascia, and enters the bladder

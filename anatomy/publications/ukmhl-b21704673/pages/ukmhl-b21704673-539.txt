507 ABDOMINAL CAVITY The serous coat, derived from the peritoneal membrane, can be best stripped off with the fingers. The subserotis coat is composed of a little areolar tissue which intervenes between the muscular and serous strata. The branches of the two vagi nerves can now be followed, as they spread out upon both surfaces of the stomach. The 7nuscular coat consists of involuntary or unstriped muscular fibres, and these are disposed in three incomplete layers—each layer being distinguished by the direction of its fibres. The stratum lotigi- tudinale (O.T. external layer) is composed of fibres which run for the most part in the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal fibres of the CESophagus, on reaching the cardiac orifice, radiate over the stomach in all directions, but more par- ticularly along the lesser curvature, and they dis- appear (with the exception, perhaps, of some on the lesser curvature) before they reach the pyloric part of the organ. On the body of the stomach a new and independent set of longi- tudinal fibres take origin, and these gradually form a continuous layer which gains in strength and thickness as it sweeps onwards towards the pylorus. The stratum circulare (O.T. middle layer) is composed of circular fibres, which are continuous with the more superficial circular fibres at the lower end of the oesophagus. They do not form a continuous coating for the stomach (Birmingham). Beginning as a series of loops immediately to the right of the oesophageal opening, they gradually increase in length as the layer is followed towards the pylorus, and soon they completely encircle the organ and form a continuous stratum. No fibres of this layer encircle the fundus. At the pylorus the circular Fig. 194.—Dissection of the three layers of Muscular Fibres in the Wall of the Stomach.

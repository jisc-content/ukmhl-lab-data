THE LEG 269 naviculare, and the intermediate cuneiform bones, to the posterior part of the interosseous space between the meta- tarsal bones of the great toe and the second toe. There it leaves the dorsum of the foot, by dipping plantarwards between the two heads of the Tibialis anterior Extensor digitorum longiis first dorsal interosse- ous muscle, to reach the plantar region where it unites with the lateral plantar artery in the forma- tion of the plantar arch. Its relations on the dorsum of the foot are very simple, (i) It lies in the in- terval between the tendon of the exten- sor hallucis longus on the medial side and the most medial ten- don of the extensor digitorum longus on the lateral side. (2) At itscommencement it is crossed by the proximal band of the cruciate ligament, whilst near its ter- mination it is crossed by the most medial tendon of the extensor digitorum brevis ; with these exceptions the vessel is simply covered by the integu- ment and fascia.

The medial terminal branch of the deep peroneal nerve lies ^ ong its lateral side, and two vena comites accompany it. As the dorsalis pedis artery traverses the dorsum of the oot it gives off several twigs to the medial margin of the foot, and also three named branches :—

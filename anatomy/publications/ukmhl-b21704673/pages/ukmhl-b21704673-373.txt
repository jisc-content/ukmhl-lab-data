MALE PERINEUM 341 it arbitrarily into two portions by drawing an imaginary transverse line between the anterior parts of the ischial tuberosities, immediately in front of the anus. Two triangles are thus mapped out. The anterior of these may be appro- priately called the urogenital triangle^ because the most im- portant objects which it contains are the urethra and the root of the penis; the posterior may be distinguished as the anal triangle, from its containing the anal canal. Fig. 127.—Body in Perineal Posture. Preparation of Part for Dissection;—To prepare the part for dissection, a staff should first be introduced into the bladder. The dissector must stand upon the left side of the subject. Having smeared the instrument with oil, hold it lightly in the right hand and guide it gently along the upper and right wall of the urethra. When the point of the instrument reaches the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm (O.T. triangular ligament),—a strong aponeurotic structure which is stretched tightly across the pubic arch—depress the handle, but use no force. Should any diffi culty be experienced, introduce the forefinger of the left hand into the rectum to guide the point of the instrument along the membranous and prostatic portions of the urethra. The most dependent part of the scrotum should now be stitched to the prepuce of the penis, and dragging both penis and scrotum forwards upon the staff, they should be fixed by means of the twine to its handle, l^astly, fasten the handle of the staff to the cord which passes behind the flexed knee-joints of the subject. The anal canal should then be slightly distended with tow, and the orifice of the anus stitched up. I—22 a

INFERIOR EXTREMITY 176 the knee, and its terminal branches turn anteriorly and later- ally to the anterior aspect of the patella. The pos- terior division reaches the surface on the medial side of the knee, posterior to the great saphenous vein, and proceeds distally to supply the integument on the medial side of the proximal part of the leg. But the main stem of the medial cutaneous nerve, before it divides, likewise sends a few twigs through the fascia lata to reach the skin on the proximal and medial aspect of the thigh. These make their appear- ance along the line of the great saphenous vein. N. Saphenus (O.T. Long Saphenous).—The sapiien- becomes cutaneous on the medial side of the knee by perforating the fascia between the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis muscles. The guide to it is the saphenous branch N. cutaneus femoris lateralis N. ilio-ingulnalis N. luniboinguinalis Branch from medial cutaneous of the thigh Intermediate cuta- neous of the thigh" Medial cutaneous^ of the thigh V. saphena magna- Anterior part of medial cutaneous-, of the thigh Ramus infrapatellaris of n. saphenus" V. saphena magna- N. saphenus- N. peronaeus superficialis_ (O.T. musculo- cutaneous) of the a. gam supre?na, which descends alongside of it. It follows the course of the great saphenous vein into the leg. Before it pierces the fascia it gives off an infrapatellar branch. The infrapatellar branch pierces the sartorius muscle and the fascia lata on the medial side of the knee, and turns laterally towards the anterior aspect of the joint, below the level of the patella.

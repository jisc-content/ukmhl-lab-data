ABDOMINAL WALI. 411 The sympathetic filaments extend downwards upon the internal spermatic artery. They come from the renal and aortic plexuses. The spermatic lymph vessels enter the abdomen through the abdominal inguinal ring, and join the lumbar glands. Testis (O.T. Testicle).—The testis should next be examined. First note its position in the scrotum. It lies somewhat Skin — Dart os Ext. spermatic fascia Cremasteric Infundibuliform fascia Parietal vaginalis Visceral tunica" vaginalis Tunica albuginea- A lobule of the testis A septule Mediastinum testis Digital fossa- I nternal spermatic vein Ductus Artery to ductus deferens Internal spermatic artery Internal muscular tunic of Kolliker Fig. 154.—Transverse section through the left side of the Scrotum and the Left Testis, seen from above. The sac of the tunica vaginalis repre- sented in a distended condition. obliquely, with its superior extremity directed forwards and laterally, and its inferior extremity backwards and medially. The left testis usually hangs at a lower level than the right. Each testis is enveloped by the tunica vaginalis testis. The tunica vaginalis is a serous sac, and, consequently, pre- sents a parietal or scrotal portion, and a visceral or testicular portion. Its extent can be demonstrated in a striking manner by making a small aperture in the parietal part, and then introducing a blow-pipe into the serous cavity and inflat- ing it with air. It will be seen to be considerably larger than

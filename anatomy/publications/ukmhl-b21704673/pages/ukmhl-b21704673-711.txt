The Publishers desire to call attention to this work, for many years undoubtedly the most popular among students. Owing to the death of Professor Cunningham, Professor Arthur Robinson, his successor in the Chair of Anatomy in the University of Edin- burgh, has undertaken the editing of the work in future. The present revision by Professor Arthur Robinson has just been brought out; in this he has entirely re-written the dissection of the pelvis, taking it from a more simple and practical method, while the opportunity has been taken to add some colour illus- trations throughout the volumes where the addition seemed to be of practical value. “ We can hardly call to mind any textbook which has been and will con- tinue to be of such practical assistance to a very large miinher of medical .students.”—Lancet. ''Stands unrivalled as a Handbook of Human Anatomy adapted both for dissecting-room work and for home reading. British Medual Join nal.

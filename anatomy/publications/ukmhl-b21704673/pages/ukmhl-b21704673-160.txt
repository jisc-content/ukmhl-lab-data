THE UPPER EXTREMITY 128 verge laterally, along the medial side of the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, and they are inserted together into the medial side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. A strong slip will generally be seen to deviate laterally from the lateral border of the muscle. This passes dorsal to the long flexor tendon, and joins the superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis. Both parts of the adductor pollicis are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve.

Fig. 51.—Volar aspect of the Bones of the Carpus and Metacarpus with Muscular Attachments mapped out. Two sesamoid bones are developed in connection with the tendons of the short muscles of the thumb as they are inserted on either side of the base of the proximal phalanx. Short Muscles of the Little Finger.—The abductor digiti quinti (O.T. minimi digiti) lies on the medial and volar aspect of the hypothenar eminence, and the flexor digiti quinti brevis (O.T. 7ninimi digiti) upon its lateral side. On separating these from each other, the opponens digiti quinti (O.T. fninimi digiti) is seen on a deeper plane, and in the interval between them. The abductor digiti quinti arises from the pisiform bone.

INFERIOR EXTREMITY 200 Circumflex Artery).—This is the largest branch which proceeds from the profunda femoris artery. It arises near the origin of the latter from the femoral artery, and runs laterally, between the divisions of the femoral nerve and under cover of the sartorius and rectus femoris muscles. It ends by dividing into ascending, transverse, and descending branches. The ascending branch reaches the dorsum ilii by passing M. rectus femoris (straight head of origin) M. rectus femoris (reflected head of origin) Attachment of the lig. lio-femorale M. adductor longus (origin) abdominis (origin) M. rectus abdominis (origin) Fig. 74.—Muscle-Attachments to the Lateral Surface of the Pubis and Ischium. • proximally under cover of the tensor fascite latte. Its terminal twigs anastomose with the superior glutteal artery. The irans- verse branch is of small size. It passes to the deep surface of the vastus lateralis, reaches the posterior part of the thigh, and inosculates with the medial circumflex artery and the first perforating artery. The descending b7-anch gives twigs to the vastus intermedins and rectus femoris, and one long branch, which may be traced distally, amid the fibres of the vastus lateralis, to the knee, where it anastomoses with the lateral superior genicular artery. ftr. gracilis (origin) M. adductor brevis (origin) M. .semimeni branosus (origin M. quadratus femoris (origin) Mm. biceps and semitendinosus (origin)

ARTICULATIONS 321 The medial meniscus is semicircular in outline, and forms the segment of a much larger circle than the lateral meniscus. Its anterior fibrous horn is fixed to the fore part of the inter- mediate rough area of the tibia in front of the attachment of the anterior crucial ligament; its posterior horn is attached to the back part of the intermediate rough area of the tibia, behind the intercondylar eminence and in front of the attachment of the posterior crucial ligament. The circumfer- ence of this cartilage is closely connected with the deep surface of the capsule where the latter is fused with the tibial collateral ligament. 2 1 12 I I 10 7 8 Fig. 119.—Parts attached to the proximal end of the Right Tibia. 1.

Ligamentum Transversum Genu.—The transverse ligament is a fibrous band which stretches across from the fore part of one meniscus to the corresponding part of the other, con- stituting thereby a bond of union between them. Dissedioti.—The condyles of the femur should now be detached by dividing the fibular collateral ligament and the crucial ligaments close to their femoral attachments. Attachment of Parts to the Proximal Surface of the Tibia. —The ligamentous structures are attached to the intermediate area on the upper surface of the tibia in the following order VOL. 1—21

ABDOMEN 4i8 have a similar course to the arteries, and end in fine twigs to the papillae of the glans. Trigonum Lumbale and Lumbar Fascia. On the sixth clay after the body was placed on its back it will be turned upon its face, with blocks supporting the thorax and pelvis, and in this position it will remain for five days. At the end of the first or the beginning of the second day of this period, when the dissector of the upper extremity has cleaned the latissimus dorsi, the dissector of the abdomen must take the opportunity of examining the posterior border of the external oblique. As tire posterior border of the muscle passes from the last rib to Serratus post. inf.

The dotted line represents the Peritoneum. the lateral lip of the iliac crest it is quite free and, in many cases, there is a small triangular interval between it and the lower part of the lateral border of the latissimus dorsi in which the fibres of the more deeply situated internal oblique can be seen. This is the trigomivi lumbale Petiti. It is a comparatively weak region of the abdominal wall, and in some rare cases hernia of the abdominal contents occurs through it. Not uncommonly, however, the lateral border of the latissimus dorsi overlaps the posterior border of the external oblique, and in these cases the trigonum lumbale does not exist. On the third day, after the dissector of the upper extremity has reflected the muscles which connect the upper extremity with the trunk on the posterior aspect, the dissector of the abdomen, in association with the dissector of the head and neck, should examine the lumbar fascia and the lumbar origins of the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles. The lumbar fascia is a portion of the lumbo-dorsal fascia which binds

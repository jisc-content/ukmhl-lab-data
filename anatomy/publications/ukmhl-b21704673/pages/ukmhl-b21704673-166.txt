THE UPPER EXTREMITY 134 distal third of the lateral epicondylar ridge of the humerus, and from the lateral intermuscular septum. From the fleshy portion of the muscle a long tendon proceeds, which passes under cover of the dorsal carpal ligament, and is inserted into the dorsal aspect of the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. This muscle is supplied by the radial nerve ( musculo-spiral). M. Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis (O.T.

Radialis Brevior).—The extensor carpi radialis brevis is closely associated with the preceding muscle. It arises by the common extensor tendon from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus; it also derives fibres from the radial collateral ligament of the elbow-joint, from the investing deep fascia, and the fibrous septa in connection with it. The tendon of the muscle accompanies that of the long radial extensor under cover of the dorsal carpal ligament, and is inserted into the dorsal aspect of the base of the third metacarpal bone immediately beyond the root of its styloid process, 'rhis muscle is supplied by the dorsal interosseous nerve.

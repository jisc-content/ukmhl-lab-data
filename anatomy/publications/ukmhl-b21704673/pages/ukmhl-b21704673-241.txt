MEDIAL SIDE OF THE THIGH 209 circumflex branch. It passes ^Josteriorly between the adjacent margins of the psoas and the pectineus, and then between the adductor brevis and the obturator externus, to the posterior region of the thigh where, close to the lesser trochanter, it divides into an ascend- ing and a transverse terminal branch. Before it divides the main trunk gives off (i) a super- ficial branch which passes medially across the front of the pectineus and between the ad- ductors longus and brevis, and (2) an arti- cularbranch which enters the hip-joint through the incisura acetabuli. The terminal branches will be examined in the dissection of the gluteal region. M. obturator externus M. obturator internus quadratus femoris M. vastus M. vastus niedialis M.

It is well now that he should revert to this vessel and study its branches in the order in which they arise. The following Tal)le may aid him in doing this :— A. profunda. Aa. pudendx externa; (superficial and deep). 1 A. epigastrica superficialis. L A. circumflexa ilium superficialis. J ® A. circumflexa femoris lateralis. A. circumflexa femoris medialis. A. femoralis. - , ^ , A. perforans prima. A. perforans secundus. Aa. Nutriciie. A. perforans tertia. A. perforans (piarta (terminal). Rami Musculares. I- A. genu suprema. M.

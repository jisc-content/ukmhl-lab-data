Its proximal margin is in a measure continuous with the deep fascia of the forearm, of which it may be considered to be a thickened part; whilst distally, it is connected with the palmar aponeurosis. Upon the volar surface of the transverse carpal ligament the expanded tendon of the palmaris longus is prolonged distally to the intermediate part of the palmar aponeurosis, whilst on N.

Close to its medial attachment the uinar artery and nerve find their way into the palm by pass- ing superficial to it and deep to a more superficial fascias band, the ligameutiun carpi volare, which is attached on the medial side to the pi.siform and the hook of the os hamatum, and on the lateral side to the tubercle of the navicular and the ridge of the great multangular bone. I he tunnel which the transverse carpal ligament forms with the volar concavity of the carpus is transversely oval in shape, and it opens distally into the intermediate compartment of the palm. Through it pass the tendons of the flexor

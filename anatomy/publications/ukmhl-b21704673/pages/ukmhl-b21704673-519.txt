487 ABDOMINAL CAVITY To obtain a proper view of these minute villous processes it is necessary to float out a portion of the small intestine in water, after it has been carefully cleansed from adhering mucus, and examine it with an ordinary pocket-lens. If a portion of the upper end of the jejunum be placed side by side with a portion of the lower part of the ileum, and inspected in this manner, the student will readily detect that the villi are, if any- thing, larger, and that they are decidedly more numerous, in the jejunum than in the ileum. They diminish gradually in number and in size as we pass down the small intestine. Aggregated lyviph nodules (O.T. Peyeds patches') and solitary lymph nodules must also be looked for. Frequently they are difficult to find, but by holding the bowel up to the light they can generally be detected. When seeking aggregated nodules it is better to begin at the lower end of the ileum and pass upwards. An aggregated lymph nodule consists of a large number of lymph follicles grouped to- gether so as to present to the eye a patch of an elongated, oblong figure. The patches are placed upon that aspect of the intestine which is opposite to the line of the mesenteric attachment, and the long axis of each corresponds in its direction with that of the intestine itself. In the lower part of the ileum the patches may present a length of one, two, or even four inches, and a breadth of about half an inch, but higher in the ileum they become much smaller and not nearly so numerous, and they are few in number or entirely absent in the jejunum.

INFERIOR EXTREMITY 194 thus formed is called the adductor canal or “ Hunter’s Canal.” When the fibrous expansion which closes in the canal is traced proximally, it is seen to become thin and ill-defined as it approaches the femoral triangle; when traced in the opposite direction, however, it becomes dense and strong, and opposite the opening in the adductor magnus it presents a thick, sharply defined margin. It stretches from the adductor longus and the adductor magnus posteriorly to the vastus medialis anteriorly.

The relationship of the parts in Adductor Canal (Hunter's) is seen. canal, where it is formed by the adductor magnus, presents a deficiency or aperture which leads backwards into the popli- teal fossa. The appearance and construetion of this aperture will be studied at a later stage. It is called the hiatus tendineus or opening in the adductor magnus. The femoral vessels and the saphenous nerve traverse the adductor canal. In this part of its course the artery gives off some muscular twigs and the arteria genu suprema. The femoral vessels leave the canal at its distal end by inclin- ing posteriorly through the opening in the adductor magnus and entering the fossa poplitea.

(4) The terminal twig, called the fourth perforating artery, pierces the adductor magnus at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the thigh. The brafuhes which spring from the profunda femoris are: — the two circumflex arteries, the four perforating arteries, and some muscular branches. The lateral cir- cumflex artery arises from the lateral as- pect of the profunda, close to its origin. It has already been followed to its dis- tribution (p. 198). The tuedial circumflex artery, which origin at the same level, but from the medial and posterior aspect of the pro- funda, will be studied when the pectineus muscle is reflected. The 7uuscular branches are irregular both in origin and size. They supply the adductor muscles, and give twigs which pierce the adductor magnus to reach the ham- string muscles. The medial cir- cumflex artery frequently arises from the femoral trunk. Arterise Perforantes (Perforating Arteries).—These arise in series from the main trunk, and pass ])osteriorly through the adductor muscles to the posterior region of the thigh. They may be recognised from the close relation which they bear to the linea aspera of the femur.

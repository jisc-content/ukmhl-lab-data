In addition to this attachment, however, a careful dissection in a good subject will show that the central part of the base projects backwards in the form of a short process or beak, which joins the central point of the perineum. Near the symphysis pubis the anterior margin, fused with the anterior margin of the deep fascia of the diaphragm, forms the transverse ligament of the pelvis.

The penis has been removed, the urethra cut across, and the inferior layer of the urogenital diaphragm removed on the left side. border of this band and the arcuate ligament of the pubis an oval gap is left for the passage of the dorsal vein of the penis. In the erect posture of the body the superficial surface of the urogenital diaphragm looks downwards and forwards, whilst its deep surface looks upwards and backwards towards the cavity of the pelvis. In close contact with its superficial surface are the parts which constitute the root of the penis, viz., the bulb and the two crura and the muscles which are associated with them, also the superficial transversus perinei muscle on each side. The structures which lie between

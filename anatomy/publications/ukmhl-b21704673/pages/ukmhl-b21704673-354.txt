322 INFERIOR EXTREMITY from before backwards:—(i) The anterior horn of the medial meniscus on the medial side of the extreme anterior part of the area. (2) The anterior crucial ligament and the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus: these are placed side by side, but the attachment of the former, which lies to the medial side, overlaps that of the lateral meniscus. (3) The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus on the summit of the intercondylar eminence between its two tubercles. (4) The posterior horn of the medial meniscus immediately behind the intercondylar eminence. (5) The posterior crucial ligament at the hinder part of the area. Articulatio Talocruralis (Ankle-joint). The ankle-joint is a diarthrodial articulation of the ginglymus or hinge variety.

It is a joint of great strength ; its stability being ensured not only by the powerful ligaments which surround it, but also by the close interlocking of the articulating surfaces. The bones which enter into the formation of the ankle- joint are the distal ends of the tibia and fibula and the proximal, medial, and lateral surfaces of the talus. The distal

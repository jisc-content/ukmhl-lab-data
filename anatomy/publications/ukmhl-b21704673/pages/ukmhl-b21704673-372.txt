ABDOMEN 34° ABDOMEN. When the body is brought into the dissecting-room, it is first placed in the lithotomy position (Fig. 127), and is retained in that posture for three days, during which time the dis- sector of the abdomen is expected to dissect the permeum. MALE PERINEUM. Boundaries of the Perineum.—The perineum may be said to correspond to the inferior aperture or outlet of the pelvis. It is necessary, then, that the student should renew his acquaintance with this part of the skeleton before he begins the dissection. Let him obtain a pelvis with the liga- ments in situ. He will observe that he has to deal with a diamond-shaped space, and that it has the following bound- aries : anteriorly, the symphysis pubis and the arcuate pubic ligament (O.T. sub-pubic); posteriorly, the coccyx ; and on each side from before backwards, the rami of the pubis and ischium, the tuberosity of the ischium, and the ligamentum sacro-tuber- osum (O.T. great sciatic). If he now turn his attention to the subject before him he can readily identify these limits. The ligamentum sacro-tuberosum, however, is somewhat obscured, from its being covered by the glutseus maximus muscle, but it can be felt by pressing deeply in a line between the ischial tuberosity and the coccyx (Figs. 127 and 128). In the undissected body the superficial area of the perineum is very limited; indeed, when the limbs are extended and approximated (as is the case when one stands erect), it merely consists of a narrow groove running forwards between the thighs from the coccyx towards the pubis. In this groove are placed the anus or orifice of the anal canal and the roots of the scrotum and penis, whilst in the middle line a cutaneous ridge—the median raphe—may be seen. This raphe can be traced from the anus forwards over the scrotum and along the under surface of the penis. Subdivision of the Space.—The perineal space has, there- fore, a diamond-shaped form, and it is customary to subdivide

307 SOLE OF THE FOOT I—20 « and its smooth, glistening internal surface will be displayed. This appearance is due to the synovial merhbrane which lines it. The tendon is inserted into the plantar part of the base of the first metatarsal bone, and also to a slight degree into the adjacent part of the medial or first cuneiform bone. It likewise, in some cases, sends a slip to the base of the second metatarsal bone. As the tendon winds Adductor halluds (oblique head) round the cuboid bone it is thickened, and contains a nodule of fibro-cartilage, or perhaps a sesamoid bone. Dissection.—The dis- section of the sole of the foot is brought to an end by disarticulating the proximal end of the first metatarsal bone. A good view is thus obtained of the continuity between the dorsalis pedis artery and the plantar arch.

Anastomosis around the Knee- joint.—The most im- portant of the anas- tomoses around the knee-joint are placed on the anterior aspect of the articulation, . and take the form of three transverse arches. The uppermost of these arterial arcades passes through the superficial fibres of the quadriceps extensor, close to the proximal border of the patella, and is formed by the union of a branch from the superior lateral genicular artery with another from the articular branch of the arteria genu suprema. The middle and lower transverse arches are both placed under cover of the ligamentum patellte. The middle arch runs across in the fatty tissue close to the distal end of the patella. It is formed by the inferior lateral genicular artery, and a branch which results from the union of a twig from the

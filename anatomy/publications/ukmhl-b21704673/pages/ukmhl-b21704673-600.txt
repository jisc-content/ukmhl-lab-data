ABDOMEN 568 should repeatedly convince himself, by introducing the index finger of his right hand into the rectum and that of his left hand into the pelvis, that he can quite easily define the outlines of the prostate and the seminal vesicles by a process of palpation, and when he has completed the dissection he should note that he has demonstrated that the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia, which is single laterally, is cleft medially Parietal pelvic fascia Seminal Vesical layer of pelvic fascia Bladder vesicle Prostate» Symphysis Pubo-prostatic ligament Arcuate ligament Transverse liga- ment of pelvis Corpus caver- nosum penis ■Rectum j • Upper fascia % pelvic diaphra- 'Rectal fascia '•Recto-vesical fascu Upper fascia of uro-gen diaphragm Dilatation of urethra in bulb Bulb of corpus cavernosum urethra Lower fascia of uro-genital diaphragm (O.T. loxN’er layer of triangular lig.) Fig. 221.—Diagram of the Pelvic Fascia as seen in a sagittal section of the Pelvis. Pelvic fascia represented in red. into three lamellae by the interposition of the rectum between a middle and a lower layer, and the interposition of the bladder and the prostate between the middle and an upper layer. There are two compartments, therefore, in the sub- stance of the fascia, a lower or posterior, which contains the rectum, and an upper or anterior, in which lie the bladder, the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and the lower parts of the ductus deferentes. Dissection.—The suspensory ligament of the penis must be detached from the front of the symphysis. The left crus of the penis has already

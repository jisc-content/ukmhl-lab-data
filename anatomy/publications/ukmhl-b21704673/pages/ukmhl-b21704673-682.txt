650 ABDOMEN The pelvic portions of the sympathetic cords are described on p. 609. The position and constitution of the coccygeal body are given on p. 609. The Pelvic Diaphragm. This is described on pp. 556, 604. The dissector should note that the levator ani muscle passes downwards and back- wards and that it gives support to the lateral border of the vagina; he should note also that the anterior borders of the two levatores ani muscles embrace the lower part of the vagina very closely, and exert a sphincter action upon it. Dissection.—After he has studied the pelvic diaphragm the dissector should remove the levator ani to display the obturator internus, and examine the attachment and arrangement of that muscle (see p. 612). He should then study the piriformis (see p. 612), and should complete his dissection of the pelvis by an examination of the pelvic articulations. The Pelvic Articulations.—These are described at p. 612. In the later months of pregnancy the ligamentous structures of the various pelvic joints become softened and thickened by the infiltration of fluid. The pelvic bones are thus separated from each other to some extent, and the calibre of the pelvic canal is increased in preparation for the passage of the child.

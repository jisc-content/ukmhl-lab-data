Laterally, also, the line of peritoneal reflection is raised until it may appear to leave the lateral surface of the bladder along the line of the ductus deferens, as this passes backwards Urethra Peritoneal reflection Peritoneal reflection Ductus deferens Prostate Fig. 236.â€”Medial section through a Male Pelvis, in which the Bladder was greatly distended.

ABDOMEN 594 its apex downwards. In size it is variable, but its average dimensions are: letigth, about one and a quarter inches (31 mm.) from base to apex; breadth, one and a half inches (37 mm.) from side to side at its broadest part. Position.—The prostate rests upon the anterior aspect of the lowest part of the rectum. It is about an inch and a half distant from the anus, whilst its anterior border lies Symphysis pubis Fig. 239.—Dissection of the two Levatores Ani. The pelvis is tilted forwards and the pubic arch has been removed. Both la)’ers of the triangular ligament, the parts in relation to them, and the pubic origins of the levatores ani, have also been taken away. The portion of bone removed is indicated by the dotted lines. three-quarters of an inch behind the lower part of the symphysis pubis. As already mentioned, the prostate is en- closed in a strong fibrous sheath derived from the pelvic fascia. This sheath is firmly fixed not only by the pubo- prostatic ligaments, which form a part of it, but also, at the apex of the gland, by the continuity which is established between the sheath and the upper fascia of the uro-genital diaphragm. These connections of the sheath prevent the prostate altering its position in response to the continual

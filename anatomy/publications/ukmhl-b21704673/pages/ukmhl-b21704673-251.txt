GLUT^.AL REGION 219 a bed in which the cutaneous nerves ramify before they enter the skin. In this region Lumbar nerves Cutaneous branches of the i2th thoracic and ilio-hypogastric' nerve the cutaneous nerves are very numerous, and they are derived from a great variety of sources. Some proceed from the posterior branches of the spinal nerves, whilst others are given off from the anterior of the spinal nerves. From the posterior branches there are usually six—three from the sacral nerves, and three from the lumbar nerves. The three sacral 7ierves reach the surface by piercing the glutaeus maximus muscle close to its origin from the sacrum and coc- cyx. They are usually of small size and pierce the muscle in a line drawn from the posterior superior iliac spine to the tip of the coccyx. The largest is found opposite the lowest piece of the sacrum, the highest about an inch above this, and the lowest about the same distance below it. Owing to the coarseness of the muscular fasciculi of the glutoeus maximus between which they appear, they are somewhat difficult to find. In looking for them, it is best to cut right down through both superficial and deep fascise, so as to secure them as they emerge from the muscle. Sacral nerves.

When flaccid, the parietal part is simply wrapped loosely over the visceral portion which adheres to the surface of the testis. A Fig. 155. A.

Dissection.—Open into the sac of the tunica vaginalis by running a pair of scissors along the anterior aspect of the parietal part. When the parietal portion of the tunica vaginalis is folded backwards the form of the testis may be studied, and also the manner in which it is attached to the posterior wall of the sac. Body of the Testis and Epididymis.—The testi.s is an oval body, with flattened sides. The posterior margin is also some- what flattened, and is in relation with the epididymis. This is an elongated and arched structure, which is adapted to the superior

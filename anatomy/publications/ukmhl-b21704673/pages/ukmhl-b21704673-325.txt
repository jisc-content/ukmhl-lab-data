In the next place, separate the contiguous borders of the flexor digitorum brevis and abductor digiti quinti. The lateral plantar artery and nerve lie, for a short portion of their course, in the interval between these muscles. Approaching the prominent base of the fifth metatarsal bone the artery disappears from view, by turning medially under cover of the flexor tendons. At the same point the lateral plantar nerve divides Flexor digitorum brevis Abductor hallucis Quadratus planta; Abductor digiti quinti Tibialis Peronxus longus Tibialis posterior Flexor hallucis brevis posterior Peronmus brevis Plantar interossei . brevis dig. quinti Adductor hallucis part) Fig. 107.—Plantar aspect of the Tarsus and Metatarsus with Attachments of Muscles mapped out. into its superficial and deep divisions. The deep division of the lateral plantar nerve and the deep part of the lateral plantar artery cannot be dissected at present. The superficial division of the nerve, however, should be traced to its distribution. M. Flexor Digitorum Brevis.—This muscle arises from the medial tubercle of the calcaneus, from the deep surface of the intermediate part of the plantar aponeurosis, and from the intermuscular septum on either side of it. About the middle of the sole the fleshy belly divides into four slips, which end I—19 (t

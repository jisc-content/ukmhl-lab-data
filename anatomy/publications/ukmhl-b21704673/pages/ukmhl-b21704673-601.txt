569 PELVIS been separated, and the right crus should now be cut away from the margin of the pubic arch and the inferior fascia of the uro-genital diaphragm, care being taken to avoid injuring the latter. As the penis is turned down the median and single dorsal vein will be seen to jmss backwards, between the arcuate ligament and the upper border of the transverse ligament of the pelvis (which is the thickened upper border of the fascire of Levator ani Dorsal vein of penis Dorsal artery of penis nerve of penis Artery to corpus cavernosum penis Inferior fascia of uro- genital diaphragm Crus penis Urethra Inferior fascia of uro-genital diaphragm Bulb Superior fascia of uro-genital diaphragm Fig. 222.â€”Dissection to show the Dorsal Vessels and Nerves of the Penis and their relations to the layers of the Uro-genital Diaphragm. The upper part of the deep transverse perineal muscle has been left between the layers of the ligament. The lower part has been removed to expose the posterior layer. The lines of the saw-cuts to be made at the next stage of dissection are indicated on the bones by the dotted lines. the uro-genital diaphragm), into the pelvis, where it will be followed at a later stage. The dorsal artery and the dorsal nerve of the penis pierce the inferior fascia of the uro-genital diaphragm near the upper part of the lateral border of the pubic arch, and the artery to the corpus cavernosum frequently passes through the diaphragm immediately to the lateral side of the nerve (Fig. 222). The proximal parts of these structures have already been seen in the dissection of the perineum. The bulb of the corpus cavernosum urethrte should now be carefully detached from the upper part of the inferior

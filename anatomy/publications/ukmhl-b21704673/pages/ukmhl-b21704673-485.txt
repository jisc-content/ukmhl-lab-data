ABDOMINAL CAVITY 453 where it is separated into two lateral parts by the falciform ligament. The right lateral part of the upper portion extends backwards, between the liver and the diaphragm, to the coronary ligament which separates the upper surface of the right lobe of the liver from the posterior surface (Fig. 200): the left lateral part of the upper end of the sac passes backwards over the upper surface of the left lobe of the liver Fig. 172.â€”Transverse Section of Abdomen at level of Epiploic Foramen. 1.

Below the falciform ligament the upper and anterior part of the great sac extends, as a continuous cavity, from side to side, and it projects back- wards, on each side, deeply into the hypochondriac, lumbar, and iliac regions (see Figs. 172 and 173). The back- ward extensions of the great sac form two deep gutters, one on each side, in which collections of fluid may become lodged when the body is lying recumbent. The lateral boundary of each of the gutter-like recesses is the lateral

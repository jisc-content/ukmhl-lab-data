HERNIA 423 distend the inguinal canal and force the abdominal contents further and further along it until they eventually protrude through the subcutaneous inguinal ring. The coverings of such a hernia will naturally be the con- stituent parts of the abdominal wall in the inguinal region that is from within outwards, (i) peritoneum, (2) extra-peritoneal fat, (3) infundibuli- form portion of transversalis fascia, (4) cremasteric fascia, (5) intercrural fascia, (6) superficial fascia, and (7) skin. A hernia which travels obliquely through the abdominal wall, along the line of the inguinal canal, is called an oblique inguinal hernia, and as the neck of the hernial sac lies to the lateral FtG. 159.—Diagram illustrating different forms of scrotal hernice. side of the inferior epigastric it is called a lateral inguinal hernia. If the cavity of the persisting processus vaginalis, into which the hernia has passed, is still continuous with the cavity of the tunica vaginalis the herniated viscus or peritoneal fold will enter the tunica vaginalis of the testicle, but if the cavity of the upper part of the processus vaginalis has been separated from that of the lower part, by the formation of an oblique or transverse septum, the upper part of the processus, with its contained hernia, may be forced downwards either anterior or posterior to the lower part, or the lower end of the upper part may invaginate the upper end of the lower part. Hernia: differentiated from each other by the relationship which the upper |)art of the processus, containing the herniated viscus, bears to the lower part, the tunica vaginalis, are described by surgeons under special names which the student will find fully explained in manuals of surgery.

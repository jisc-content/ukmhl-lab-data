ARTICULATIO HUMERI 93 surrounds the margin of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and is attached to its rim. It deepens, and at the same time serves to extend, the articular socket of the scapula. The intimate connection which it presents with the capsule of the joint can now be studied. Two tendons are also closely associated with it, viz. the long head of the triceps brachii below, and the long head of the biceps brachii above.

Long Head of the Biceps. — The long tendon which receives this name is an important factor in the construc- tion of the shoulder-joint. Entering the capsule through the opening between the two tubercles of the humerus, it is prolonged over the head of the bone to the top of the glenoid cavity. Its origin should now be examined. It divides into three portions, viz. a large intermediate part, which obtains direct attachment to the scapula, and two smaller lateral parts, which diverge from each other and blend with the labrum glenoidale. The long head of the biceps brachii.

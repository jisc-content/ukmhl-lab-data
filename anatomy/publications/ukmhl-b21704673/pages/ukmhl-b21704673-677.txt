PELVIS ^M5 Traced towards the uterus it is found to end blindly. Laterally it may end in a similar manner, or it may pierce the posterior layer of the broad ligament and end in a dilated vesicle of piriform shape called the vesicular appendix or Hydatid of AIorgag7ii. This maybe attached to one of the fimbrite of the uterine tube. The Eectum.—A detailed account of the rectum in the male is given on p. 582 ; the student should read that account and then note the points of difference in the female. In the upper part of its extent the rectum of the female is separated from the uterus and vagina by the recto-vaginal excavation of peritoneum and the coils of intestine which it .ppvmlicca ||^iculo^i Morgag^ni Upoophoron Lat. border of broad Corpus luteum Ovary Lig. of ovary Lower border of broad lig.

The Uterus, with the Broad Ligament stretcliing out from either side of it. (From Gogenbaur.) contains. Below the bottom of the pouch the rectum is in apposition with the posterior wall of the vagina, the layer of recto-vaginal fascia alone intervening. The connection be- tween the rectal and vaginal walls is very loose above, but is closer below. This arrangement has an important bearing upon the manner in which prolapse of the uterus occurs. The Anal Canal.—The anal canal bends downwards and backwards from the rectum, commencing about one inch and a half in front of the tip of the coccyx and terminating at the anal orifice. An angular area is thus left between the anterior wall of the canal and the back of the genito-urinary cleft. This area is occupied by a pyramidal mass of firm fibro-muscular tissue called the permeal body.

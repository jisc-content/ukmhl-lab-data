FOSSA POPUTEA 243 the plantaris, and finally at its termination it sinks under cover of the proximal border of the soleus. 'I'hroughout its whole course the popliteal artery rests upon the floor of the fossa poplitea. In its upper part it is separated from the femur by some fatty tissue ; then it crosses the oblique ligament of the knee-joint; and lastly it comes into con- tact with the fascia covering the popliteus muscle. The popliteal vein is placed upon a more super- ficial plane, and crosses the artery. In the proximal part of the fossa it is placed upon the lateral side of the artery, whereas in the distal part it is situated upon its medial side. The two vessels, however, are in close association through- out, and are bound together by a dense fibrous sheath. The tibial nerve is super- ficial to both vessels, and crosses both from the lateral to the medial side; in the proximal part of the fossa it lies a short distance lateral to the vein, but in the distal part it lies on the medial side. The branches of the popliteal artery are :— Adductor magnus Popliteal vein Popliteal artery A. genu superior medialis A. genu superior lateralis A. genu inferior lateralis Head of fibula A. genu inferior medialis Popliteus Soleus Fig. 90.—Popliteal Artery and its Hranches. 1. Muscular. 2. Cutaneous. 3. Genicular. The muscular branches consist of an upper and a lower set. The upper branches are distributed to the hamstring muscles near their insertions. The lower branches, termed the sural arteries, end chiefly in the two heads of the gastrocnemius ; but twigs also go to the soleus and plantaris. The cutafieous branch, called the superficial sural, usually

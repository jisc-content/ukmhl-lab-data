ARTICULATIONS 323 ends of the leg bones are very firmly united together by an interosseous and other ligaments which give the joint a certain amount of elasticity or spring. They form a deep hollow resembling a mortice. The upper part of the talus is received into this cavity. Distal end of shaft of tibia Tibio-fibular interosseous membrane Distal end of shaft of fibula Tuber calcanei Groove on medial malleolus for tendon tibialis posterior Trochlear surface of talus Deltoid ligament Fibrous sheath for tendon flexor hallucis longus Sustentaculum tali xor hallucis longus tendon Posterior talo-calcanean ligament Posterior ligament of lateral malleolus (O.T. Posterior inferior tibio-fibular ligament) Transverse inferior tibio-fibular ligament Facet on astragalus for trans- verse inferior tibio-fibular ligament Posterior talo-fibular ligament Calcaneo-fibular ligament Fig. I2I.—Ankle-joint dissected from behind with part of the Capsular Ligament removed. The ligaments of the ankle-joint are :— 1. Capsula articularis. 2. Ligamentum deltoicleum. 3. Ligamentum talofibulare anterius. 4. Ligamentum talofibulare posterius. $■ Ligamentum calcaneo-fibulare. Disseclion.—The remains of the transverse and laciniate ligaments, together with the tendons which are in relation to the joint, should be removed and the ligaments defined. The anterior and posterior parts of the capsule should be first dissected. They may then be removed in

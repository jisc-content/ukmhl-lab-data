328 INFERIOR EXTREMITY Syndesmosis Tibioflbularis (O.T. Inferior Tibio-fibular Joint) (Figs. 120 and 121).—This articulation is constructed upon a stronger plan, because the strength of the ankle-joint very largely depends upon its security. In some cases a very narrow strip of the distal part of each of the opposing surfaces of the bones is articular and coated with cartilage, in other cases articular cartilage is etitirely abse?it. Above this the surfaces are rough, and are held together by an exceedingly strong interosseous ligament, composed of short fibres which pass directly between the bones. Fig. 124.—Vertical section through the Foot, along a line stretching from the centre of the heel behind to the centre of the great toe in front. (From Luschka.) 1. Tibia. 2. Talus. 3. Calcaneus. 4. Navicular. 5. First cuneiform. 6. First metatarsal. 7 & 8. Phalanges of hallux. 9. Sesamoid bone. 10. Tendo calcaneus. 11. Bursa between tendo calcaneus and calcaneus. 12. Tendon of extensor ballucis longus. 13. Tendon of flexor ballucis longus. 14. Plantar aponeurosis (intermediate p.art). 15. Thick superficial fascia of heel. In addition to this interosseous ligament there are:— 1. Lig. malleoli lateralis anterius (O.T. Ant. inf. tibio-fibular ligament). 2. Lig. malleoli lateralis posterius (O.T. Post. inf. tibio-fibular ligament). 3. Inferior transverse ligament. The anterior and posterior ligaments are flat strong bands which pass from the tibia to the fibula, in an oblique direc- tion, laterally and distally.

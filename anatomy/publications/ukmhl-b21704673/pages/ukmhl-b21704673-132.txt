The nervus profundus soon disappears from view by passing backwards on the lateral side of the radius through the fibres of the supinator muscle.

It has been traced in its farther course (p. 96). The ramus superficialis is a purely cutaneous nerve, and gives off no branches until it gains the dorsal aspect of the lower end of the forearm. Muscles.—The muscles on the volar aspect and medial border of the forearm are arranged in a superficial and a deep group. I’hey comprise the flexors of the wrist and fingers, and also the pronators. In the superficial group

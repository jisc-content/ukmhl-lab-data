Kidney Capsule and Kidney Substance.—The kidney is invested by a strong fibrous coat, which can be easily stripped from its surface. Divide this capsule along the lateral margin of the organ and peel it off towards the hilus.

Examine the manner in which the ureter or duct is con- nected with the kidney. As it approaches the hilus it expands into a wide funnel-shaped portion called the pelvis (Fig. 209). This enters the sinus and divides into two, or perhaps three, large primary branches, and these again break up into a

ABDOMEN 6i6 Ligamentum Sacroiliacum Interrosseum.—The interosseous sacro-iliac ligament \?, strong. It consists of fibrous bands, which connect the rough surface on the posterior part of the lateral aspect of the sacrum with a corresponding rough surface on the ilium, behind the auricular surface. Upon the interosseus sacro-iliac ligaments the strength of the articu- lation chiefly depends. As the sacrum narrows towards its dorsal surface it cannot be regarded as forming a typical key- stone of an arch. It may be regarded as being, in a great measure, suspended from the iliac bones by ligaments.

Ligamentum Sacroiliacum Posterius Longum.— The long posterior sacro-iliac ligament is fixed above to the posterior superior spine of the ilium ; w'hilst, interiorly, it is inserted into the third tubercle on the posterior surface of the lateral mass of the sacrum. It lies posterior to the interosseous ligament. Jmgamentum Sacroiliacum Posterius Breve. — The short postei'wr sacro-iliac ligament also lies behind the interosseous ligament, and is a short band of fibres which extends from the posterior inferior spine of the ilium to the back of the sacrum.

576 ABDOMEN utriciilus prostaticus. Its orifice is narrow, but the recess widens out towards its blind upper end, and its length, which may be gauged with a probe, varies from a quarter to half an inch (6-12 mm.). It is of interest both practically and developmentally,—practically, because it is sometimes large enough to entangle the point of a small catheter or bougie, and developmentally, because it represents, in the male, the vagina and uterus of the female. On the margins of the prostatic utricle the dissector will find the slit-like orifices of the ejaculatory ducts. The ducts themselves run downwards, along the lateral walls of the utricle, between the middle and lateral lobes of the prostate. Bristles should be passed through the apertures into the ducts. Owing to the projection of the urethral crest from the middle of the floor of the canal a transverse section of the prostatic portion of the urethra presents a crescentic figure— the convexity of the crescent being directed forwards and the concavity backwards.

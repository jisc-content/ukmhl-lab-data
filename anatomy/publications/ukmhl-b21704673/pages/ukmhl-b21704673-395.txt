363 MALE PERINEUM The dorsal nerve of the penis follows the pudendal artery between the two fascife of the urogenital diaphragm, where it lies more completely under shelter of the side of the pubic arch than the artery. Finally, piercing the superficial layer of the diaphragm, about half an inch below the symphysis pubis, it accompanies the dorsal artery of the penis. At the root of the penis it supplies one or two twigs to the corpus cavernosum penis.

Transversus perinei Colles' fascia I Fig. 136.—Dissection to expose the Prostate from the Perineum. J The dissection of the perineum, to the extent usually possible in three t days, is now completed, and the student should notice that in the urethral ; triangle he has opened two fascia-bounded compartments. The superlicial 1 compartment lies between Colies’ fascia and the urogenital diaphragm. Posteriorly this is closed by the union of the fascia and the diaphragm. Laterally it is closed by the attachment of the fascia and the diaphragm to the rami of the ischium and pubis. Anteriorly, since the fascia of Colles is continuous with the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the abdominal wall, the pouch is open, and fluid poured out into it can ]>ass upwards to the abdominal wall. For the contents of the pouch see p. 343. The deep pouch lies between the two fasciic of tlic urogenital diaphragm. It is closed posteriorly and anteriorly by the union of the two layers, and laterally by the attachment of the two layers of the diajihr.agm to the rami , of the pubis and iscliium.

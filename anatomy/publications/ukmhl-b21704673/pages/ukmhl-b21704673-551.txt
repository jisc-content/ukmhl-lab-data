519 ABDOMINAL CAVITY The loiver and posterior surfaces are both divided into segments by a right and a left pair of fosste which run parallel with the sagittal plane. The left pair of sagittal fossae, which separate the lower and the posterior surfaces into right and left lobes, are the fossa for the U7nbilical vem on the inferior surface, and the fossa for the ductus venosus on the posterior surface. The right pair of sagittal fossae, which segment the lower and posterior surfaces of the right lobe, are the fossa for the gall-bladder on the lower surface and the fossa for the inferior vena cava on the posterior surface. The Lower Surface of the Liver looks downwards and backwards and rests either upon viscera situated at a lower level in the abdomen or upon the front of the lesser omentum. It is separated into a smaller right and a larger left segment or lobe by the fossa for the umbilical vein. On the lower surface of the right lobe, close to its posterior border and at its left extremity, is the porta hepatis or hilus of the liver, through which the hepatic artery and the portal vein pass into the liver and the bile-ducts and the lymph vessels pass out. It connects the posterior part of the fossa for the umbilical vein with the posterior part of the fossa for the gall-bladder.

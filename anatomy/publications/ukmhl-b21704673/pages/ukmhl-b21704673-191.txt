159 AR'riCULATIONS Articulatio Intercarpea (Intercarpal Joint). The intercarpal joint has one joint cavity, but it includes not only the articulations between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones which form the transverse part of the joint but also the articulations between the bones of the proximal row and those between the bones of the distal row. The main part of the cavity of the joint lies between the bones of the proximal and distal rows; but two prolongations pass proximally, one between the os lunatum and the os naviculare, Recessus sacciformis Discus articularis Os lunatum tritjuelrum liamatiim Os naviculare maiius Os capitatum Os mult- angulum minus Os maliangu- lum majus Fig. 63.â€”Coronal section through Kadio-carpal, Carpal, and Carpo- metacarpal and Inter-metacarpal Joints to show Joint Cavities and Interosseous Ligaments (diagrammatic). and the other between the os lunatum and the os triquetrum, and three diverticula are prolonged between the bones of the distal row, beyond which they become continuous with the cavity of the carpo-metacarpal joint. The bones of the proximal row are connected together by two dorsal, two volar, and two interosseous ligaments, which pass from the os lunatum to the os naviculare and os tri- quetrum, which lie to either side of it. The two interosseous ligaments are composed of short, stout fibres which pass between the non-articular portions of the opposed surfaces of the bones. They are readily seen from the proximal aspect,

71 FRONT OF THE ARM of the biceps brachii. The latter fibres constitute the lacertus fibrosus, and form a very distinct band (O.T. semilunar or bicipital fascia) which, continuous with the fascia above and below, bridges across the brachial artery, and is lost upon the pronator teres muscle on the medial side of the forearm. The fascia brachii may be reflected by making an incision through it along the medial line of the front of the arm. In throwing the medial portion medially, the dissector must leave the lacertus fibrosus in position. This may be done by separating it artificially from the general aponeurosis by an incision above and below it. Lateral inter- muscular septum Fig. 29.—Diagram (after Turner) to show how the Arm is divided by the intermuscular septa and bone into an anterior and posterior compartment. These compartments are represented in transverse section. A.s the foregoing dissection is proceeded with, it becomes evident that septa or partitions pass in between the muscles from the deep surface of the investing fascia brachii. Two of these possess a superior strength, and obtain direct attach- ment to the humerus. They are the lateral and medial intermuscular septa. The connections of these cannot be fully studied at present, but it is important that the student should understand their relations at this stage. In the course of the dissection of the arm they will gradually be displayed. 1 he septum intermusculare mediale is the stronger and more distinct of the two. It is attached to the medial epi- condylar ridge, and may be followed proximally as high as the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle. The septum intermusculare laterale is fixed to the lateral epicondylar I—5/j

ARTICULATIO HUMERI 89 of the glenoid cavity—the socket in which it moves ; (2) by the great laxity of the ligamentous structures which connect the humerus with the scapula. These provisions for allowing an extensive range of movement at this articulation might, at first sight, lead one to doubt the security of the joint. Its strength certainly does not lie in the adaptation of the bony surfaces to one another, nor in the power of its ligaments. It lies—(i) in the intimate manner in which the scapular muscles are arranged around it ; (2) in the overhanging coraco-acromial arch which forms, as it were, a secondary socket for the head of the humerus, and effectually prevents any displace- ment in an upward direction ; and (3) in atmospheric pressure, which Capsule of joint Humerus Deltoid Fold of capsule of Joint Latissimus dorsi Subscapularis anterior praspinatus Posterior circumflex artery of humerus and axillary (O.T. circumflex) nerve Teres major Radial (O.'F. musculo-spiral) Fig. 38.—Coronal or vertical transverse section through the Left Shoulder-joint. (Viewed from behind.) exercises a powerful influence in keeping the opposed surfaces in contact with each other. From all points of view, except over a small area below, the loose, ligamentous capsule which envelops the shoulder-joint is supported by muscles, the tendons of which are more or less intimately connected with it. Above, it is covered by the supraspinatus ; behind, the infraspinatus and teres minor are applied to it; in Jront is the subscapularis. Below, the capsule is to a certain extent unsupported by muscles, and here it is prolonged downwards, in the form of a fold, in the ordinary dependent position of the limb (Fig. 38). When, however, the arm is abducted, this told is obliterated, and the head of the bone rests upon the inferior part of the capsule, which now receives partial support from two muscles which

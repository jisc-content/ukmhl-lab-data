533 ABDOMINAL CAVITY large number of short stunted secondary divisions called calices or infundibula, which are attached to the walls of the sinus. The kidney should now be cut into two in the longitudinal direction. Use a large knife, and, entering it at the lateral border, carry it steadily through the gland sub- stance to the hilus. An examination of the cut surface of the kidney will show that its sub- stance is arranged in two parts — a medullary and a cortical. The medullary portion is seen to consist of dark-coloured, faintly striated pyramidal masses, the bases of which are directed to- wards the periphery, whilst their apices are free and project into the sinus. On the sinus wall each of these appears in the form of a pro- ^ —From a figure by Ma.x Brddel to show .,V the form of the Pelvis of the Ureter and the minent mammillary projection, called a renal papilla, which projects into one of the calices of the pelvis of the ureter (Fig. 2io). If the kidney be squeezed, fluid will be seen to exude from these papillae, showing that the tubuli uriniferi open upon their surface. The number of pyramids and renal papillae vary from eight to twenty. Usually there are more than twelve. A single calyx of the ureter may surround one, two, or even three renal papillae, and receive the urine which issues from the I—34i Cilices, as well as the relation of the main branches of the Renal Artery to these. The ureter, pelvis, calices, and arteries were injected with celloidin, and then the kidney substance was removed by means of a digesting fluid. It is thus a cast of the pelvis and calices which is represented, and the cupped appearance of each caly.x shows the manner in which the corre- sponding renal papilla projects into the calyx.

ABDOMINAL CAVITY 475 of peritoneum which passes from the lower border of the ileum to the anterior surface of the mesentery of the appendix or, sometimes, to the appendix itself. The retro-ciccal or retro-colic fold passes upwards behind the upper part of the caecum and the lower part of the ascending colon ; when it is present the vermiform process usually lies in it. The inter-sigmoid fossa should also be looked for at this stage, in order that, if it is present, its boundaries may be examined before they are interfered with by dissection. It runs upwards liehind the root of the Transverse colon Iliac colon Mesentery of small intestine Pelvic colon Upper recess of oriental bursa Right colic flexure (O.T. hepatic flexure) Right lateral part of lower peritoneal com- partment Left colic flexure T. splenic Left lateral part lower perito- neal compart- ment Descending colon Ascending color* Caecunr.

To find it, turn the pelvic part of the colon upwards. Dissection.—.\fter he has examined any of the occasional peritoneal fossae which happen to be present the dissector shoukl remove the right layer of the jieritoneum of the mesentery, the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon, and the peritoneum of the jiosterior wall of the abdomen between the root of the mesentery and the ascending colon. Commence at the upper end of the jejunum and pass downwards to the lower end of the ileum, then u|nvards along the right side of the posterior wall of the abdomen ; finally clear away the lower layer of the transverse meso-colon.

3M INFERIOR EXTREMITY side of the patella and ligamentum patellae, in order that the common extensor tendon and the patella may be thrown distally over the proximal end of the tibia. The joint is now opened from the front, and the parts in the interior may be observed.

Posterior view. I Interior of the Joint.—First note the great pad of soft faj which is placed on the deep surface of the ligamentum patellae.j In vertical section this fatty mass is triangular in form (Fig. 117).! It is termed the mfra-patellar pad, and it fills up the intervaj between the patella, femur, and tibia, and adapts itself t(^ the varied forms which this recess adopts in the differenj movements of the joint. It is separated from the interio^ of the joint by a covering of synovial membrane, and fronil its surface a band of this membrane extends posteriorly ancj proximally to the anterior margin of the intercondylar foss^

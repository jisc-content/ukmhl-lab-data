ABDOMINAL CAVITY 427 posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall, taking with it a fold of peritoneum termed the falciform ligament of the liver. Shape and Boundaries of the Abdominal Cavity.—The abdominal cavity is ovoid in shape, its vertical diameter being the longest. Superiorly, it is roofed by the dome- shaped diaphragm, which presents a deep concavity towards the abdomen. Inferiorly, it is floored by the pelvic diaphragm, formed by the levatores ani and the coccygei muscles, which is also concave towards the abdominal cavity. Neither the roof nor the floor is complete and unbroken. The diaphragm is per- forated by certain struc- tures which pass between the thorax and the ab- domen. The continuity of the pelvic diaphragm is broken by the passage of certain structures be- tween the pelvic division of the abdominal cavity and the perineum. The upper part of the ab- dominal cavity extends upwards for a consider- able distance under the shelter of the lower ribs and their costal cartil- ages. The protection which is thus afforded to the viscera in this portion of the cavity is most complete laterally and behind. In front, as the costal cartilages ascend towards the sternum, a wide A-shaped gap is left between those of opposite sides. The level to which the costal arches descend on either side varies greatly in different subjects, but, in the great majority of cases, a narrow belt of abdominal wall, from one to two inches wide, is left between the lower border of the chest wall and the highest point of the iliac crest.

524 ABDOMEN altogether absent, and the hepatic lobules rest directly upon their walls. A section should now be made through the liver substance and the cut surface examined, distinguished from the hepatic points of difference :— Portal Veins. 1. Are always accompanied by a branch of the duct and a branch of the hepatic artery. 2. Mouths usually collapsed. 3. Walls thicker. 4. Walls separated from the liver substance by the fibrous cap- sule. The portal veins can be readily veins. The following are the Hepatic Veins. 1. Are solitary and not accom- panied by any other vessel. 2. Mouths usually open and gaping. 3. Walls exceedingly thin. 4. Walls apparently in direct apposition with the liver substance. Structure of the Liver.—Very little of the structure of the liver can be learned in the dissecting-room. It is com- pletely enveloped by a fibrous capsule (Glisson’s). This is thick where the peritoneum is absent; but very thin where that membrane is spread over the gland. The liver substance pre- sents a mottled appearance, and when torn or ruptured the surface exhibits a granular aspect. The minute particles which give rise to this appearance are the hepatic lobules. In the human liver these are not completely separated from each other. Each lobule may be regarded as a miniature liver; they are 'Suprarenal vein all built Up of the same con- Surface stituents, but covered by . , inferior vena tn6SC C3.H Only cava made out by the aid of the microscope.

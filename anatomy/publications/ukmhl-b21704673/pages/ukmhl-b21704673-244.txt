INFERIOR EXTREMITY 2 I 2 brevis. Anterior to it are the pectineus and adductor longus muscles. It gives branches to three muscles, viz. the adductor longus, the adductor brevis, and the gracilis. Very rarely it will be observed to supply a twig to the pectineus. In addi- tion to these it supplies an articular branch to the hip-joint (Fig. 8o, X ) a fine twig, which appears at the distal border of Femoral nerve (O.T. ant. crural) Lumbo-inguinal nerve Femoral sheath Femoral canal Obturator artery Obturator nerve M. adductor longus Fig. 81.—Dissection to show the Structures surrounding the Obturator Foramen of the Hip Bone. the adductor longus, to join the sartorial plexus (Fig. So); and a terminal twig which goes to the femoral artery—(Fig. So)— and breaks up into fine filaments upon its walls. The posterior branch of the obturator nerve, as it enters the thigh, pierces the upper border of the obturator externus. It extends distally, between the adductor brevis and the adductor magnus, and is chiefly expended in the supply of the latter muscle. It gives also, however, a branch to the obturator externus and an articular branch to the knee-

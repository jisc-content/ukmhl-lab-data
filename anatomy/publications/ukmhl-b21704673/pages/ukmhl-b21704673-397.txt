FEMALE PERINEUM 365 a collection of adipose tissue under the integument. It is covered with hair. Labia Majora.—These correspond to the scrotum in the male, cleft along the middle line. They are two rounded folds, which commence in front at the mons Veneris, where they meet in the anterior commissure, and extend down- wards and backwards towards the anus. They diminish in thickness as they proceed backwards, and they meet posteriorly in the posterior commissure. Laterally they are covered by skin studded with scattered hairs, whilst medially they are coated with smooth humid integument, the free surface of which is lubricated by a semi- solid secretion, de- rived from numerous sebaceous glands which open upon it. During parturition the labia majora are un- folded, and thus give the vagina a greater capability of dilata- tion. The labia majora enclose an elliptical fissure, which is termed the riina pudendi, or the urogenital fissttre, on account of its containing the apertures of the urethra and vagina. Labia Minora or Nympbse.—These represent the male prepuce. They are two pendulous folds of integument which lie within the labia majora. To display them fully the labia majora must be pulled apart. They are placed one on each side of the vaginal orifice. As they proceed forwards they become more prominent, and at the same time converge so as to approximate to each other more closely. Reaching the clitoris, each terminates by splitting into two divisions or folds. The smaller and lower fold is attached to the under surface of the clitoris, and receives the name of frenulum clitoridis. The upper fold arches over the clitoris like a hood, and unites with the corresponding fold of the opposite side to form the preeputium clitoridis.

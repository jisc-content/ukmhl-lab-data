THE LEG 287 inserted into the tuber-cle of the navicular bone, and also by a number of slips into certain of the tarsal and metatarsal bones. These will be dissected later on. The tibialis posterior is supplied by the tibial nerve. Arteria Peronea.—This vessel may now be traced distally as it runs along the fibula under cover of the flexor hallucis longus. It is accompanied by two vence comites. About an inch or an inch and a half proximal to the ankle-joint it gives off its perforating branch, and then, continuing distally. , ^ , Medial calcanean qiiadratus planta; 1 vessels and nerve Abductor digit. c|umt.

In addition to these it gives off— 1. Muscular branches. 2. A. nutritia fibulae. 3. Ramus communicans. The tnuscular branches supply the muscles around it. The ; nutrient artery enters the nutrient foramen on the posterior j surface of the fibula. The commimicating artery arises a short

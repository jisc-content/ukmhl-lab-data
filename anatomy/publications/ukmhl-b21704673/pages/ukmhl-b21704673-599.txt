567 PELVIS been demonstrated. The recto-vesical layer must now he incised, in the medial plane, on the posterior surface of the prostate and each half must be turned laterally. As the borders of the prostate are approached a plexus of veins will be exposed on each side, and immediately beyond the plexus the recto-vesical layer of the fascia will be found to blend with the vesical layer, which passes over the upper surface of the prostate. The ducti deferentes and the seminal vesicles will be exposed when the reflection of the recto-vesical layer is carried backwards beyond the prostate (Fig. 220). itxus maximus Sphincter ani extemus Crus penis Iniemal pudendal artery Bulb Urogenital diaphragm (inferior f^cia) regcnital diaphragm (superior fascia) Prostate Levator ani Seminal vesicle tactii-s deferens (Hresical fascia Rectal fascia Rectum Levator ani Ischio*cavernosus muscle Bulbo-cavernosus muscle Urethra Inf. fascia of urog. dia.

The True Ligaments of the Bladder.—There are live so- called true ligaments of the bladder, two laieral, the lateral pubo-vesical ligaments, two anterior, the medial pubo-vesical ligaments, and one superior. The lateral are the lateral parts of the vesical layer of pelvic fascia. The anterior are two thickenings of the same layer, one on each side of the medial plane in front of the bladder; they contain smooth muscle fibres which pass from the bladder to the back of the pubic bones at the margins of the symphysis. The superior, the lig. umbilicale medium, is formed by the urachus. During the various stages of this dissection the student

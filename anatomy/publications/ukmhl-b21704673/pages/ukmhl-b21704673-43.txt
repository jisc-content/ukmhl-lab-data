PECTORAI. REGION 11 division into sternal and clavicular parts clearly made out. The muscular fibres are rendered tense by abducting the arm from the side. On the right side the dissector begins at the inferior border of the muscle, whilst on the left side he commences at the superior border. lie must also clean the anterior margin of the deltoid. In the interval between the deltoid and the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major the cephalic vein and, subjacent to it, the deltoid branches of the thoraco-acromial artery, and the infraclavicular lymph glands will be found. The “cleaning” of a muscle means the removal of the whole of the deep fascia from its surface. To do this successfully the dissector must Central elands M. serratus anterior Subscapular glands M. latUsiinus dorsi M. pectoralis major M. pectoralis minor Pectoral glands Lymphatic vessels to sternal glands M. deltoidens Cephalic vein I. pectoralis major Chain of glands related to the axillary vessels Fig. 4.—The Lymph Glands and Vessels of the .‘\xilla and Mamma. (From Poirier and Cuneo—modified.) follow three rules, (i) Me must cut boldly down through the deep fascia till he exposes the red fibres of the muscle. (2) As he removes the fascia he must keep the knife edge playing against the fibres of the muscle. (3) As he makes his cuts he must carry the knife blade in the direction of the fibres of the muscle. If he follows rules i and 2 he will not leave a thin film of fascia on the muscle, and as he follows rule 3 he will find that the direction of his incisions change as the course of the fibres of the muscle changes. If the work is well done the deep fascia should be removed from the muscle as a continuous unperforated layer of fibrous tissue, and the surface of the muscle will be clean.

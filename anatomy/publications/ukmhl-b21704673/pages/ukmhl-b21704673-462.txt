430 ABDOMEN line which encircles the body at this level indicates on the surface the position of the intertubercular plane of subdivision. The two horizontal planes, thus placed, map out the abdomen into three districts or zones, which are termed from above downwards—(i) the costal^ (2) the iwibilical, and (3) the Jt)>pogastric zone. Fig. 162.—The Abdominal Viscera as seen from the front after removal of the great omentum. The dark lines indicate the subdivision of the abdominal cavity. (Birmingham.) The two vertical planes of subdivision are called the rigM and left lateral planes. Each corresponds, on the surface, to a perpendicular line reared from the midpoint between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium. By these lateral planes, each of the three zones determined by the horizontal planes of section is subdivided into three. The costal zone is mapped olf into a central epigastric

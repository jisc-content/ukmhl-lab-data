252 INFERIOR EXTREMITY it clasps the neck of the femur, and anteriorly, it is attached to the whole length of the linen mlertrochanierica, and to the root of the great trochanter. This attachment is very firm and strong. Posteriorly and distally, it falls short of the crista intertrochanterica by about half an inch, and it presents a weak attachment to the distal part of the posterior surface of the neck of the femur.

Pubo-capsular ligament Obturator membrane When the capsule of the hip-joint has been carefully cleaned ! it will be seen that the fibres which compose it run in two j different directions. The majority pass in a longitudinal direction from one bone to the other; others, however, may ■ be observed to take a course more or less at right angles to the former.

The longitudinal fibres i are massed on the front of the joint. Certain thickened :

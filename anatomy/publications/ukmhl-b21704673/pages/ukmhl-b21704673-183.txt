ARTICULATIONS prolonged into the proximal radio-ulnar joint, so that both articulations possess a single continuous synovial cavity. Movements at the Elbow-joint.—The movements at the elbow-joint must not be confounded with those that take place at the proximal radio- ulnar joint. At the elbow-joint two movements, viz. flexion, or forward movement of the forearm, and extension, or backward movement of tlie forearm, are permitted. The muscles which are chiefly concerned in flexing the forearm upon the arm at the elbow-joint are the biceps, the brachialis, the muscles attached to the medial epicondyle, and the brachio-radialis. The muscles which extend the forearm at this articulation are the triceps and anconreus and the muscles which spring from the lateral epicondyle. Dissection.—It is advisable to study the radio-carpal, or wrist-joint, before the articulations between the two bones of the forearm are examined. The transverse volar and dorsal carpal ligaments, together with the extensor and flexor tendons, should be completely removed from the'wrist. No attempt, however, should be made to detach the extensor tendons from the dorsal aspects of the fingers and thumb. The short muscles of the thenar and hypothenar eminences must also be taken away.

521 ABDOMINAL CAVITY the posterior surface of the left lobe merges with the sharp margin of the organ. It has been pointed out that the oesophagus is separated from the bottom of the oesophageal groove in the liver by the prominent anterior margin of the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, which in the first instance then must be regarded as being responsible for this depression (Birmingham). On the posterior surface of the right lobe may be recog- nised—(i) the lobus caudatus (Spigelii); (2) the fossa for Left triangular ligament (O.T. left lateral ligament) CEsophagus Inferior vena cava Coronary ligament Omental tubercle of liver Caudate (O.T. spigelian) Pylorus Fig. 201.—Liver, Right Kidney, Spleen, and Stomach, as seen from behind.

The lobus caudatus (O.T. lobus Spigelii) is the portion of liver substance which lies between the fossa of the ductus venosus and the fossa of the inferior vena cava. Its lower end appears on the under surface of the liver immediately behind the porta hepatis. It is separated into the papillary process on the left and the caudate process on the right (Fig. 200). The caudate lobe forms the bottom of the vertebral hollow, and is separated from the bodies of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth dorsal vertebrie by the diaphragm and the lower part of the descending thoracic aorta.

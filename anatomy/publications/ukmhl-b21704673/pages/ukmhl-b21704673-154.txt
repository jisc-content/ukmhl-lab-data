I 2 2 THE UPPER EXTREMITY digitorum sublimis, the flexor digitorum profundus, the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, and the median nerve. The relation of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis to the transverse carpal ligament is peculiar. It pierces the lateral attachment of the ligament, and proceeds distally in the groove of the os multangulum majus in a special compartment provided with a special mucous sheath. Mucous Sheaths of the Flexor Tendons.—As the flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel they are enveloped in two mucous sheaths, which at the same time line the walls of the canal, and thus greatly facilitate the Median nerve Tendons of flexor digitorum profundus Sheath of flexor pollicis longus Tendon of fle.xor pollicis longus Sheath of flexor carpi radialis Tendon of flexor carpi radialis Lig. carpi transversum (O.T. ant. annular lig.)

As already stated, these sheaths are two in number. One is wrapped around the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, the other invests the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum sublimis. Both are prolonged proximally into the forearm for an inch or more, and both are carried distally into the palm in the form of diverticula upon the diverging tendons. The diverticula in relation to the tendons which go to the index, middle, and ring fingers, end near the middle of the palm. Those upon the tendons of the thumb and little finger, however, are prolonged distally into the digits, and line the fibrous sheaths which confine the tendons upon the volar aspects of the phalanges. It is not likely that these mucous sheaths have been preserved intact throughout the previous dissection of forearm and palm ; but should they

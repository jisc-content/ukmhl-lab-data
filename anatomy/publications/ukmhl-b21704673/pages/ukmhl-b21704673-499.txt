467 ABDOMINAL CAVITY Birmingham, the stomach-bed. It is formed by the following structures, all of which are related to the lower surface of the organ; (i) the gastric surface of the spleen; (2) the left suprarenal gland and a varying amount of the upper part of the left kidney; (3) the upper surface of the pancreas; (4) the transverse meso-colon; and (5) the transverse colon. A niche of the great sac of the peritoneum intervenes between the stomach and the spleen, and the omental bursa separates it from the left suprarenal capsule, the kidney, the pancreas. Fig. 180.—Outline of the upper aspect of the Stomach of a Child which has been hardened hi situ by formalin injection. It is the same stomach as is figured on p. 434. and colon, whilst the transverse meso-colon intervenes between it and the coils of the small intestine. The right, upper, or posterior border of the stomach is termed its lesser cuj-vature. It extends from the cardiac orifice to the pylorus, and curves round the base of an eminence, on the lower surface of the left lobe of the liver, called the tuber omentale, and also to a smaller extent round a corresponding prominence of the pancreas. It-is therefore concave, and from it proceeds a fold of peritoneum, called the gastro-hepatic omentum, which connects the stomach to the liver and, to a slight extent, to the diaphragm. The left, lower, or anterior border of the stomach, called the greater airvature^ on account of its great length, is convex and is directed to the left and I—30 a

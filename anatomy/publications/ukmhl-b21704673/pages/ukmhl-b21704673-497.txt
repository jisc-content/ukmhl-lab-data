The gullet or oesophagus opens into the stomach above and to the left, whilst below and to the right the stomach becomes continuous with the duodenum or first part of the small intestine. The form and the position of the organ within the abdomen are greatly influenced not only by the amount of food it con- tains but also by the empty or distended condition of the other hollow viscera in its vicinity. It is convenient to describe it as it appears when moderately distended. It then assumes a pyriform shape and is strongly curved upon itself. It is cus- tomary to recognise in connec- tion with the stomach : (i) a blunt left extremity or fundus; (2) a narrow right extremity or pylorus; Thoracicduct_ (3) two orifices, a i2th thoracic vertebra, cardiac and a pyloric ; Abdominal aorta- (4) two surfaces, a superior and an inferior; and (5) two borders or curvatures, a greater and a lesser. The/w«t/«T, or left,'or cardiac end, is full and rounded, and forms a marked bulging directed upwards and backwards. It occupies the back part of the left cupola of the diaphragm, from which it is separated in part by the spleen and the liver. To the right of the fun- ius and about two inches below its summit is the otsophaneal mrJiM orifice. This is placed on the upper part or com. VOL.

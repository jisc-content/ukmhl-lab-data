ABDOMEN 434 Fasten the lower border of the anterior surface of the liver to the right costal arch and examine the stomach. Ventriculus (Stomach).—I'he stomach is a pear-shaped organ which lies in the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions, partly below and partly to the left side of the liver. Its long axis runs obliquely and is curved upon itself, the bass or fundus of the organ being situated above, behind, and to the left, whilst the apex or pylorus lies lower, more anteriorly, and more to the right. Traced from its highest to its lowest point it runs first forwards and slightly downwards, then to Fig. 164.—Stomach of a Child, two years of age, hardened i?i situ by formalin injection. the right, and finally slightly backwards to its junction with the duodenum or proximal portion of the small intestine. When the left lobe of the liver is pulled upwards and to the right the oesophagus will be found entering the stomach a little to the right of the highest point of the fundus, at the cardiac or oesophageal orifice. From this point the two borders of the stomach can be traced to the pyloric end of the organ. The upper border or small curvature is much the shorter; it runs downwards and to the right in a fairly uniform curve. The great curvature is much longer. First it ascends from the oesophagus to the highest point of the fundus. After crossing

ABDOMINAL CAVITY 461 nerve; trace its branches along the wall of the stomach and towards the spleen. Finally clean the crura of the diaphragm to the level of the orifice through which the oesophagus enters the abdomen. When the dissection is completed the dissector is in a position to study the coeliac artery and its branches, the blood supply of the stomach, and the bed of the stomach. Arteria Coeliaca (O.T. Coeliac Axis).—The coeliac artery is a short, wide vessel, which springs from the front of the aorta, between the two crura of the diaphragm, immediately above the upper margin of the pancreas. It is directed horizontally forwards, and, after a course of little more than half an inch, divides into three large branches, viz.—(i) the left gastric; Fig. 177.—The Coeliac Artery and its branches. (2) the hepatic ; and (3) the splenic, which radiate from each other like the spokes of a wheel. The coeliac artery is surrounded by a thick, matted plexus of nerves, called the cceliac plexus, which sends numerous nerve twigs with the three branches of the artery. Arteria Gastrica Sinistra (O.T. Coronary Artery).—This, the smallest of the three branches of the coeliac artery, proceeds upwards and to the left, behind the omental bursa and through the left pancreatico-gastric fold, to the oesophageal opening of the stomach, where it changes its direction, enters between the two layers of the lesser omentum, and runs, from above downwards and to the right, along the lesser curvature of the stomach. Near the pylorus it ends by

ABDOMEN 596 The delicate ejaculatory ducts pierce the base of the prostate a short distance behind the internal urethral orifice of the bladder, and, as they descend, they separate the so-called middle lobe from the remainder of the gland, which is generally spoken of as consisting of two lateral lobes. Vesiculae Seminales.—The two seminal vesicles lie between the fundus of the bladder and the rectum. Each is about two inches (50 mm.) in length and is conical or piriform in shape. The lower pointed end of each vesicle rests on the Fig. 240.—Horizontal section through the Bladder and Rectum at the level at which the ureters enter the bladder. base of the prostate, and the blunt upper end lies in the sacro-genital fold of peritoneum in relation with the recto- vesical excavation of peritoneum, and with the entrance of . the ureter into the bladder. At their lower extremities ; ! the vesicles are separated from each other only by the inter- posed deferent ducts, but they diverge as they ascend, and ^ their upper ends are wide apart. They are enclosed, together with the deferent ducts, which lie along their medial sides, in a dense sheath derived from the recto-vesical layer of the visceral pelvic fascia. Each vesicula seminalis is in reality a closed tube, five or six inches long, which is coiled upon itself and bound into vesicular form by the dense areolar tissue in which it is though there is no structural demarcation between them.

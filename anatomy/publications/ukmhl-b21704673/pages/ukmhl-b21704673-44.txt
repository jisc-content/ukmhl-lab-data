THE UPPER EXTREMITY I 2 the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles, immediately below the clavicle, are placed one, or it may be two, lymph glands which receive the lymphatic vessels which accompany the cephalic vein. These vessels convey the lymph from the lateral side of the arm and the shoulder. M. Pectoralis Major.—This powerful muscle extends from the anterior aspect of the thorax to the humerus. It is divided by a deep fissure into a clavicular and a sternocostal portion. The fissure' penetrates through the entire thickness of the muscle, the clavicular and sternocostal portions being thus distinct, except close to their insertion. The clavicular portio7i arises by short tendinous and muscular fibres from an impression on the medial half of the anterior surface of the Fig. 5.—Under Surface of the Clavicle with the Attachments of the Atuscles mapped out. clavicle. The superficial part of the sternocostal portio7i takes origin by fleshy fibres from the anterior surface of the sternum, from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, and, occasionally, from the sixth rib near its cartilage. The deeper part rises by a variable number of muscular slips from the cartilages of the upper six ribs. The pectoralis major is inserted, by a flattened bilaminar tendon, into the lateral lip of the sulcus intertubercularis of the humerus, and the fibres of the muscle undergo a re- arrangement as they converge upon this tendon. The greater part of the clavicular portion joins the anterior lamina of the common tendon; some of the most medial clavicular fibres, however, are inserted directly into the humerus below the tendon, whilst a few gain attachment to the deep fascia of the arm, and others become adherent to the adjacent part of the deltoid. The fibres of the sternocostal portion of the muscle take

165 ARTICULATIONS I—11 b movements of abduction and adduction, it should be noticed that in the extended position of the fingers they are very free ; but if flexion be induced, the power of separating the fingers becomes more and more restricted, until it becomes absolutely lost when the hand is closed. An examination of the collateral ligaments will afford the explanation of this. These “ are attached so far dorsally on the metacarpal bones, as to be much nearer to their distal ends than to their volar aspects ” (Cleland). Consequently, while they are comparatively lax in the extended position of the fingers, the further flexion advances the tighter they become, and in this way they interfere with the lateral movements of the first phalanges. The first phalanx of the thumb has only a limited range of movement at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Articul.\tiones Digitorum (Joints of the Fingers). The ligaments connecting the phalanges are arranged upon a plan identical with that already described in connection with the metacarpo-phalangeal joints. This should not be made an excuse, however, to slur them over. Movements.—From the manner in which the articular surfaces are adapted to each other, flexion and extension are the only movements which can take place at the interphalangeal joints. Flexion of the second phalanges of the fingers is brought about by the flexor sublimis, and of the ungual phalanges by the flexor profundus. Extension of the phalanges at the interphalangeal joints is largely produced by the interosseous and lumbrical muscles acting through the extensor tendons, into which they are inserted. These muscles, therefore, whilst they flex the first phalanx at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, extend the second and ungual phalanges at the interphalangeal joints. In the case of the thumb, the long flexor and the extensor pollicis longus operate at the interphalangeal joint.

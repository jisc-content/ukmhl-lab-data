DISSECTION OF THE BACK 43 vertebrae, and also to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium. The costal slips of origin interdigitate with the lower digitations of the external oblique muscle of the abdominal wall. The fibres of the latissimus dorsi converge rapidly as they approach the lower part of the scapula. The highest fibres pass almost horizontally towards this point; the lowest fibres ascend almost vertically; whilst the intermediate 1. Serratus posterior inferior. 2. I.,atissimu.s dorsi. 3.

As a result of this convergence of fibres, the muscle is greatly reduced in width; and it sweeps over the inferior angle of the scapula in the form of a thick, fleshy band, which winds round the lower margin of the teres major muscle to gain insertion,- by means of a narrow, flat tendon, into the floor of the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus (Fig. 33, p. 79). This insertion cannot be studied at present, but will be seen later on. With the teres major muscle the latissimus dorsi forms the posterior fold of the axilla. At first it is placed on the dorsal aspect of

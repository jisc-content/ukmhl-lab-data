PECTORAL REGION 7 cover of the serratus anterior muscle. At a later stage these branches will be found appearing between the digita- tions of the serratus anterior. The anterior branches come out, as a rule, about an inch in front- of the corresponding- posterior branches, and then proceed forwards over the lower border of the pectoralis major muscle, where they should be sought for at once. From the lower members of this series some minute twigs are given off, which enter the superficial •i Fibrous trabeculae of the gland M. teres major M. latissimus dorsi M. pectoralis major Lobules of the gland Ampullae of ducts M. serratus anterior Fig. 2.—Dissection of the Mamma. surface of the digitations of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The posterior branches run backwards, to the dorsal aspect of the trunk, over the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle. It is advisable not to attempt to secure the two highest lateral cutaneous nerves (i.e. those issuing from the second and third intercostal spaces) in the meantime. They are best dissected along with the other contents of the axilla. Dissection.—If the subject be a female the dissector should endeavour to make out the connections, and also something of the structure, of the mamma. The small area of skin which has been left over the areola should be raised towards the summit of the nipple, and bristles may be introduced through the orifices of the ducts which may be seen on the I—1 h

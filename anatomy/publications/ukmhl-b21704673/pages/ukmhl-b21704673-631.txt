599 PELVIS After birth, when the umbilical cord is ligatured and divided, a portion of each hypogastric artery, from the umbilicus to the sciatic notch, undergoes atrophy, and is ultimately converted into a fibrous cord known as the lateral umbilical ligament. This springs from the lower end of the trunk, or from the anterior division of the hypogastric artery, and runs forward on the side wall of the pelvis to the apex of the bladder, whence it ascends to the umbilicus. At the side of the pelvis it lies at a higher level than the obturator nerve, and it passes to the lateral side of the ductus deferens. For about the first two inches of its extent it has a small lumen, and from this part one or more superior vesical branches arise.^ Branches of the Divisions of the Hypogastric Artery.

Arterise Vesicales Superiores (Superior Vesical Arteries). —As a rule there are two or three slender superior vesical arteries which spring from the umbilical artery. They supply the greater part of the superior and infero-lateral surfaces of the bladder, and occasionally one of them gives off the artery to the ductus deferens., an extremely slender branch which can be traced along the deferent duct to the testicle. Ai'teria Vesicalis Inferior (Inferior Vesical Artery).— ’ Although the portion ot the hypogastric artery of the foetus which runs from the great sciatic notch through the umbilicus to the placenta is the direct continuation of the main trunk, it is frequently called the umbilical artery and is spoken of as a branch of the hypogastric artery. When this terminology is adopted the lateral umbilical ligament is said to be the remains of the umbilical artery.

THE UPPER EXTREMITY 62 bands, which are placed in relation to the transverse artery of the scapula and the suprascapular nerve. The ^lpper transverse ligament of the scapula bridges across the incisura scapulae and converts it into a foramen. It lies between the transverse artery of-the scapula and the suprascapular nerve : the former being placed above it, and the latter below it. Not infrequently it is ossified. The inferior transverse ligament of the scapula is a weaker band; it bridges across the transverse artery of the scapula and the suprascapular nerve as they pass through the great scapular notch. On the one hand, it is attached to the lateral border of the spine of the scapula, and on the other, to the back part of the neck of the scapula. FRONT OF THE ARM. In this dissection the following parts have to be studied :— 1. Cutaneous vessels and nerves. 2. Brachial aponeurosis. 3. Brachial artery and its branches. 4. Median, ulnar, radial, and musculo cutaneous nerves and branches of the last two. 5. Biceps, coraco-brachialis, and brachialis muscles. In conjunction with this dissection, it is convenient to study the triangular space in front of the elbow, and also to trace the cutaneous nerves to their ultimate distribution in the skin of the forearm. Surface Anatomy.—In a muscular limb the prominence formed by the biceps muscle along the front of the upper arm is very apparent. Every one is familiar with the rounded swelling which it produces when powerfully contracted in the living subject. On either side of the biceps there is a feebly marked furrow, and ascending in each of these there is a large superficial vein. In the lateral furrow is the cephalic vein; in the lower part of the medial furrow the basilic vein. In the upper part of the medial bicipital sulcus is an elongated bulging produced by the subjacent coraco-brachialis muscle. This is useful as a guide to the lower part of the axillary and the upper part of the brachialis arteries, which lie

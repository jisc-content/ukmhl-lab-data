INFERIOR EXTREMITY ;o8 arteria genu suprema, and another from the superior medial genicular artery. The lowest arch lies on the tibia, immedi- ately above its tuberosity, and results from the anastomosis of the anterior recurrent tibial and inferior medial genicular arteries. The upper and middle of these transverse arches are connected, on each side of the patella, by ascending and descending branches, which anastomose with one another, and thus enclose the patella in an irregularly quadrilateral arterial framework. From all sides of this arterial enclosure, twigs are given off which enter small Superior medial artery of the knee Vastus lateralis Deep branch of arteria genu suprema Vastus medialis Ligamentum patellge Medial meniscus Rectus femoris I’iceps femoris Superior lateral arter)' of the knee Patella Fibular collateral ligament Head of fibula Anterior recurrent tibial artery Anterior tibial artery Ligamentum patellae Inferior medial artery of the knee Tibial collateral ligament Fibulae collateral ligament Inferior lateral artery of the knee Fig. 113.—Anastomosis pn the front of the Left Knee-joint. foramina on the anterior surface of the patella to supply the osseous substance. Six arteries therefore take part in the formation of this system of anastomoses, on the front and lateral aspects of the joint, viz. the articular branch of the arteria genu suprema, the two superior and the two inferior genicular branches of the popliteal, and the anterior recurrent branch of the anterior tibial. In addition to the twigs which proceed from these, to form the arterial arches, numerous branches are given which spread over the bones in the form of a close meshwork. During the dissection of the articula- tion these vessels will become apparent. The knee-joint is supplied on its posterior aspect by twigs derived from all the genicular branches of the popliteal. These twigs are variable in

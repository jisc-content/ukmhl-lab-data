84 THE UPPER EXTREMITY Triceps (outer head) Deltoid Brachialis Musculo-spiral groove Teres minor ment of the humcral heads Infraspinatus triceps as they are exhibited in the dissected part. The caput later ale of the triceps arises from the lat- eral and posterior aspect of the body of the humerus, proximal to the sulcus for the radial nerve. It takes origin, by short tendinous fibres, along a line which descends verti- cally from the insertion of the teres minor above to the upper border of the sulcus for the radial nerve. But it also derives fibres from a strong aponeurotic bridge or arch, which is thrown over the groove, so as to give protection to the a. profunda brachii and the radial nerve. The strength and position of this arch can be tested by thrusting the handle of the knife distally and laterally in the sulcus for the radial nerve, and along the course of the nerve and artery under the lateral head of the triceps. By its distal end the arch is connected with the lateral intermuscular septum. The caput mediale of the triceps is placed distal to the sulcus for the radial nerve. It sends upwards, on the posterior aspect of the humerus, and along the medial margin of the groove, a Origin of e.\- tensors Medial epi- condyle Ancotiaius Fig. 36.â€”Dorsal aspect of the Humerus with Attachments of Muscles mapped out.

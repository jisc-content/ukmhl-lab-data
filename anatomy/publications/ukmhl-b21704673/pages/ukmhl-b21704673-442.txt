ABDOMEN 410 intervenes between them, and also by the investments which are given to the cord by the abdominal wall. The external spermatic artery is a branch of the inferior epigastric, and has already been seen entering the cremaster muscle. The external spermatic nerve, a branch of the genito- femoral nerve, has a similar destination. It has also been parts.

The ductus deferc7is (O.T. vas deferens), the duct of the testis, can always be distinguished by the hard, firm, cord- like sensation which it gives when the spermatic cord is held between the finger and thumb. It ascends along the posterior part of the cord. At the abdominal inguinal ring, however, it separates from the spermatic vessels, and lies to their medial side; as it enters the abdomen it hooks round the inferior epigastric artery. The artery to the ductus deferens is a small branch from a superior vesical. It follows the duct to the testis. displayed in aprevious stage of the dissection. Fig. 153.â€”Dissection of the Left Sper- matic Cord to show its constituent The internal spermatic artery arises within the abdomen from the front of the aorta, it enters the cord at the abdominal inguinal ring, and proceeds to the testis, into the posterior border of which it sinks, after dividing into several smaller twigs. The pampini- form veins issue from the testis at its posterior border, and, as they pass upwards, they form, in the cord, a bulky plexus, which is termed the pampinifo7-m plexus. A single vessel, the spemnatic veiti, issues from this, and enters the abdomen through the abdominal in- guinal ring. On the right the inferior vena cava; on

ABDOMEN 346 Sphincter Ani Externus.—When this muscle is cleaned it will be seen to consist of a thick ring of muscular fibres surrounding the orifice of the anal canal. Posteriorly^ it is attached, by a pointed tendon, to the tip and posterior surface of the terminal part of the coccyx; anteriorly, it blends with other perineal muscles in the central point of the perineum. The fibres, in passing between these two points of attachment, encircle the anal orifice and constitute a true sphincter muscle. Some of the superficial fibres, both in front and behind the anal opening, are di- rectly attached to the skin. It draws its nerv- ous supply from two sources, viz., the foii7ih sacral nerve and the in- ferior hceni07'rhoidal 7terve. Ischio-rectal Fossa.— Although the anal canal is the largest and most important object which is contained within the posterior portion of the perineum, it does not fill up the entire extent of the anal triangle. An interval or recess is left upon each side of the anal canal—between it and the ischium, — and to this recess is given the name of the ischio-7-ectal fossa. In shape the ischio-rectal fossa is pyramidal, the apex of the pyramid being directed superiorly towards the pelvic cavity, and the base inferiorly towards the integuments. The medial wall of the space is sloping, whilst the lateral wall is steep and perpendicular. Boundaries.—Whilst the term '■'■ischio-rectal" is applied to this fossa, it must be borne in mind that neither the ischium nor the anal canal enters directly into the formation of its walls. Both are separated from the space by fascial and muscular layers. Upon the medial aspect of the ischium is the obturator Fig. 130.—Diagram. The arrow is directed upwards into the ischio-rectal fossa. The parietal pelvic fascia is seen upon the inner surface of the obturator internus. Observe also the anal fascia clothing the lateral surface of the levator ani and the rectal fascia upon its medial surface.

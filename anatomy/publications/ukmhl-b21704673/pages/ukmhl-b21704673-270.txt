The saphenous nerve, accompanied by the ramus saphenus of the arieria genu suprema, will be found under cover of the sartorius. They afterwards come to the surface at its posterior border.

The upper boundaries have been pulled apart and the aponeurosis into which the two heads of the gastrocnemius is attached has been split and the heads have been displaced to their respective sides. of that muscle, whilst the posterior division of the medial cutaneous nerve of the thigh (O.T. internal cutaneous) courses distally along the posterior border of the same muscle, and comes to the surface a short distance posterior to the saphenous nerve. Properly speaking, these structures belong to the thigh and they have already been seen in the dissection of its medial region (p. 198). When the boundaries of the fossa are thoroughly

FOSSA POPLITEA 245 ligament of tlie knee-joint. It pierces this ligament to reach the synovial membrane. Vena Poplitea (Popliteal Vein).—The popliteal vein is formed near the distal border of the popliteus muscle by the union of the venae comites of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. It runs proximally through the fossa poplitea, and, entering the adductor canal through the opening in the adductor magnus, it becomes the femoral vein. The relations which it presents to the popliteal artery have already been detailed. In addition to tributaries corresponding to branches of the artery, it receives the small saphenous vein, which has been seen piercing the popliteal fascia to join it. By slitting it open with the scissors the dissector w’ill see that it possesses three (sometimes four) valves in its interior. Nervus Obturatorius (Obturator Nerve).—This minute nerve will be found lying upon the medial side of the popliteal artery. Trace it proximally and it will be seen to enter the space by piercing the distal fibres of the adductor magnus; follow it distally, and it will be observed to enter the knee- joint by penetrating the oblique popliteal ligament. BACK OF THE THIGH. The dissection of the back of the thigh must be com- pleted on the fifth day. The following are the structures which are brought into view:— 1. .Superficial fascia. 2. Cutaneous nerves. 3. Deep fascia. {Biceps femoris. Semitendinosus. .Semimembranosus. Adductor magnus. S Nerves f Posterior cutaneous of thigh, f .Sciatic. 6. Arteries, Four perforating. Reflection of Skin.—A vertical incision must be made in the medial line of the thigh through the belt of skin which still encircles the limb posteriorly. The two flaps can then be reflected, the one laterally and the other medially. Superficial Fascia—Cutaneous Nerves.—In the fatty super- ficial fascia thus brought into view cutaneous twigs from four sources must be looked for—(i) along the medial line of the

ABDOMEN 558 to the medial sides of the seminal vesicles. The pelvic portions of the ureters can be seen descending, outside the peritoneum, along the front of the hypogastric arteries, and turning medially, below the ductus deferentes, towards the base of the bladder. The prostate lies below the bladder and encloses the prostatic part of the urethra (Fig. 214).

It covers the upper surface of the bladder, and passes from the lateral borders of that surface to the lateral walls of the pelvic cavity as the lateral false ligametiis of the bladder. Turning over the posterior border of the upper surface of the bladder, it descends, for a slight distance, on the fundus or base of the viscus, and then, if the bladder is empty, it projects backwards as a semi- lunar ledge or fold, the sacro-geiiital fold. In the middle portion of this fold arc enclosed the seminal vesicles and

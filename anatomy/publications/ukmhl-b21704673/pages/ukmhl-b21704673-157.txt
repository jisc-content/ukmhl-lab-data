125 FOREARM AND HAND tinguish two kinds, viz. vincula brevia and longa. In the accompanying illustration (Fig. 50) the connections of these may be seen. The vincula brevia are triangular folds, which connect the tendons near their insertions to the volar aspect of the adjacent phalan.x. The vincula longa are not invariably present. They are placed more proximally, and are narrow, weak folds which pass between the tendons and the bones. Insertions of the Flexor Tendons.—The insertions of the two flexor tendons can now be studied. On the volar side of the first phalanx the tendon of the flexor sublimis becomes flattened and folded round the subjacent cylindrical tendon of the flexor profundus. It then splits into two parts, which pass dorsal to the tendon of the flexor profundus, and allow Fig. 50.—Flexor Tendons of the Finger with Ligg. vaginnlia. the latter to proceed onwards between them. Dorsal to the deep tendon the two portions of the tendon of the flexor sublimis become united by their margins, and then they diverge, to be inserted into the borders of the body of the second phalanx.^ By this arrangement the flattened tendon of the flexor sublimis forms a ring, or short tubular passage, through which the tendon of the flexor profundus proceeds onwards to the base of the ungual phalanx, into which it is inserted. In each of the four fingers the same arrangement is found; the tendon of the flexor sublimis is inserted by two slips into the margins of the volar surface of the second phalanx, whilst the tendon of the flexor profundus is in- serted into the volar aspect of the base of the terminal phalanx. ' Where the margins of the two slips of the tendon of the flexor sublimis are united behind the tendon of the flexor profundus, a decussation of fibres takes place between the two slips.

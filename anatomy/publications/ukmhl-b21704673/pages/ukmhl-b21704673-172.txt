In a well-injected limb it will be seen to end on the dorsum of the carpus by anastomosing with the volar interosseous artery and the dorsal carpal arteries. In addition to the branches which it supplies to the muscles, it gives off one large branch called the interosseous recurrent artery. The arteria inter os sea recurrens takes origin from the parent trunk as it appears between the supin- ator and the abductor pollicis longus, and turns proximally, under cover of the anconccus muscle, to reach the dorsal aspect of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. The ancon- seus should be detached from its origin and thrown medially, in order that the artery may be traced to its termination. The inter- osseous recurrent artery will then be seen to end by anastomosing with the posterior terminal branch of the profunda artery of the arm. Anastomosis arormd the Elbow - joint. — The series of inosculations around the elbow should now be reviewed as a whole. A distinct inos- culation will be found to take place upon both the anterior and posterior aspect of each epicondyle of the humerus. Behind the lateral epicondyle the interosseous recurrent artery joins the postei'ior branch of the profunda brachii artety: anterior to the same epicondyle the anterior branch of the proftmda Imichii artery communicates A. collateralis .ulnaris inferior (O.T. anasto- matic) Ant. terminal of A. pro- funda brachii •A. radialis ulnaris Aa. recurrentes ulnares A. interossea recurrens . interossea dorsalis --■-—-••'A. interossea volaris Fig. 55.—Diagram of Anastomosis around the Elbow-joint.

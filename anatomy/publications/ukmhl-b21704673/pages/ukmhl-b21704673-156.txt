THE UPPER EXTREMITY 124 phalangeal joints. Each fibrous sheath consists of a number of parts of which the two strongest, the digital vagifial ligaments^ lie opposite the bodies and are attached to the margins of the first and second phalanges. Such strong bands ! placed opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints would seriously interfere with their movements, therefore, in these regions weaker transverse bands, the aiuiular liga- cruciate bands—the cruciate liga77tents—are often found, intervening between the annular ligaments and the stronger portions of the sheaths. The fibrous sheath, together with the phalanges and the volar accessory liga- i ments of the metacarpo- phalangeal and interphalan- geal joints, forms, in each finger, an osteo-fibrous canal, in which are enclosed the tendons of the flexor digi- torum sublimis and of the flexor digitorum profundus together with their surround- ing mucous sheath. The fibrous sheaths in front of one or more of the fingers may now be opened. They will be seen to be lined by a mucous sheath, which is reflected over the enclosed tendons so as to give each a separate investment. The mucous sheath of the little finger has been seen to be a direct pro- longation from the common mucous sheath of the flexor tendons; the other three are distinct from this, and are carried proximally into the palm. They envelop the tendons of the ring, index, and middle fingers, as far as a line drawn across the palm immediately proximal to the heads of the metacarpal bones. If the flexor tendons be raised from the phalanges certain mucous folds will be noticed connecting them to the bones. 'These are termed the viticula tendina. Of these we dis- ments, are formed.

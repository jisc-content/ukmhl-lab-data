60s PELVIS and its posterior margin is separated from the lower border of the piriformis by the inferior glutmal and pudendal vessels and the sciatic and pudendal nerves as they pass out of the pelvis. The Pelvic Nerve Plexuses.—There are two pelvic spinal nerve plexuses, viz. the sacro-pudendal and the coccygeal.

The Sacro-Pudendal Plexus (O.T. Sacral Plexus).—The anterior primary divisions of six spinal nerves take part in the formation of this plexus, viz., part of the fourth lumbar nerve, the fifth lumbar, the first, second, and third sacral nerves, and part of the fourth sacral nerve.

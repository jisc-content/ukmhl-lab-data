The medial wall of the right gutter is formed by the right kidney and the ascending colon (see Figs. 173 and 174), and the medial wall of the left gutter by the 1 20 9 10 II 12 13 Fig. 173.â€”Transverse Section of Abdomen immediately below Epiploic Foramen. 1.

The dissector should pass his hand from above down- wards along each of these lateral gutters of the anterior part of the great sac and he will find that each is divided by a transverse fold of the peritoneal wall into an upper and a lower part, but the division occurs at very different levels on the opposite sides. On the left side the fold which separates the upper from the lower part of the left gutter is the phrenico-colic ligament, which lies at the level of the eleventh

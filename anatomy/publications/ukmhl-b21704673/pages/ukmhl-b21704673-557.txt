ABDOMINAL CAVITY 525 the fashion of a helmet, and are prolonged downwards for a short distance upon its anterior surface and its medial border. The suprarenal glands lie in the epigastric region, and rest upon the diaphragm. The Right Suprarenal Gland is, as a rule, triangular in form, and rests, by its base, upon the anterior and medial aspect of the upper end of the right kidney. It is placed between the posterior surface of the right lobe of the liver and that portion of the diaphragm which covers the side of the spine. The anterior surface, which looks laterally as well as forwards, presents two impressions—(i) The one is a narrow flattened strip, adjoining the anterior border of the gland, which is overlapped by the inferior vena cava; (2) the second impression comprises the remainder of the anterior surface, and is in contact with the liver. Only a small and variable part of the lower portion of the anterior surface of the right suprarenal gland is covered by peritoneum. On the upper part of the impression for the vena cava, not far from the apex of the gland, a short fissure termed the hilus may be observed, vein which immediately enters the inferior vena cava. The posterior surface of the right suprarenal gland is divided by a salient curved ridge into an upper flat part, which is applied to the diaphragm, and a concave lower part, which is occupied with fat and rests upon the kidney. The Left Suprarenal Gland is semilunar in form, and, as a rule, is slightly larger than the right. Its position on the kidney is also somewhat different. It is usually placed on its medial border immediately above the hilus. The anterior surface presents, not far from its lower end, a very obvious hibis with a large emerging vein. The greater part of this surface is separated from the posterior-inferior surface of the stomach by the posterior wall and the cavity of the Fig. 203.—Anterior Surface of Left Suprarenal Gland.

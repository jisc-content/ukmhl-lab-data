324 INFERIOR EXTREMITY order to bring the powerful lateral and medial accessory ligaments more fully into relief. At the same time the articulating surfaces will be dis- played, and the play of the surfaces can be studied when the joint is flexed and extended. Anterior and Posterior Segments of the Capsule (O.T. Anterior and Posterior Ligaments).—These are feeble bands which are placed in front of and behind the joint. They are attached to the margins of the articulating surfaces, Cuboid Dors.al c.alcaneo-cuboid ligament ■ Calcaneo-cuboid joint J • Tendon of peronmus longus ^ Interosseous talo-calcanean ligament I Talo-calcanean joint Lateral talo-calcanean ligament Fig. 122.—Ligaments on the Lateral Aspect of the Ankle-joint and on the Dorsum of the Tarsus. except in front and distally where the anterior segment is fixed to the neck of the talus. The fibres of these liga- ments have for the most part a transverse direction. The Lateral Accessory Bands (O.T. External Lateral Ligament).—The lateral accessory bands of the capsule of the ankle-joint are three in number, (i) The anterior talo- fibular ligament; (2) the posterior talo-fibular ligament; (3) the calcaneo-fibular ligament. The anterior talo-fibular Ugainent is the most anterior of the three. It is a flattened band which passes forwards from Posterior ligament of lateral malleolus (O.T.

ABDOMEN I. 5°4 independent opening into the duodenum above, and anterior to, the opening of the main duct. The dissector is now in a position to study the bile-ducts and the portal vein. The Bile-Ducts.—The ducts which carry the bile, secreted by the liver, from the liver and the gall-bladder to the duodenum are (i) the right and left hepatic ducts, (2) the common hepatic duct, (3) the cystic* duct, and (4) the common bile-duct. Bile flows only in one direction through the hepatic ducts and the common bile-duct, that is, towards the duodenum, but through the cystic duct it flows sometimes to and sometimes from the gall- bladder. The right and left igSrCJ .4-. ”iatonnh'e“ns hepatic ducts issue from the correspond- Bile-papilla Commonopening ing lobes of the Hver of bile and pan- • ^ , , into the porta Frenulum Fig. 193.—The Bile-Papilla in the interior of the Duodenum. (Birmingham.) creatic ducts hepatis, and unite within it to form the cotnmon hepatic duct. The latter, which is about one inch (2.5 c.m.) in length, de- scends into the up- per part of the small omentum, where it unites with the cystic duct, which has already been examined p. .447, to form the common bile- duct. As it descends, the‘’common hepatic duct passes either in anterior or posterior to the right branch of the hepatic artery. Ductus Choledochus (O.T. Common Bile-Duct).—The common bile-duct is from three and a half to four inches long (8.7 to 10 c.m.). In the flrst part of its course it lies in the right free border of the lesser omentum, to the right of the hepatic artery, and in front of the foramen epiploicum, from which it is separated by the right border of the portal vein and the posterior layer of the small omentum. In the second part of its course it passes behind the first part of] the duodenum, with the gastro-duodenal artery, close to the posterior end of the neck of the pancreas; then, entering on ¥

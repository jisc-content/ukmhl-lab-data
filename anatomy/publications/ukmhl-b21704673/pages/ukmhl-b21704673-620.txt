588 ABDOMEN orifice which separates it from the lower end of the fundus. This border is separated from the back of the symphysis and the pubo-prostatic ligaments by the retro-pubic pad of fat, which appears in medial sections of the pelvis as a small wedge- shaped mass of soft, fatty areolar tissue (Fig. 235). This pad is continuous with other parts of the extra-peritoneal fat, and adapts itself to the changing conditions of the bladder. The internal urethral orifice, by which the urine leaves the bladder, is placed at the junction of the fundus with the anterior border, and occupies the most dependent position. It is surrounded by the base of the prostate which presents Ductus deferens Seminal vesicle Prostate Ureter nfero-lateral surface Membranous urethra Fig. 234.— Bladder hardened in situ viewed from the right side. It contained a slightly larger amount of fluid than the specimen depicted in Fig. 232. (A. F. Dixon.) a structural continuity with the bladder wall. The term neck is frequently applied to this region of the bladder. Changes in the form of the Bladder as it becomes filled with Urine.—The neck of the bladder is firmly fixed in position by its attachment to the prostate and by its connec- tion with the diaphragmatic layer of the pelvic fascia, and the prostate is securely held in place by its strong sheath of pelvic fascia; therefore, as the bladder becomes filled, the internal urethral orifice suffers very little change of position. It is only in cases of excessive distension that any marked change in its level becomes manifest, and under such circumstances the internal urethral orifice sinks, to a certain extent, in the pelvic cavity.

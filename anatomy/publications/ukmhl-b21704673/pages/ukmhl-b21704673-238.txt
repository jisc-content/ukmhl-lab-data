2o6 INFERIOR EXTREMITY ligament. At first it is placed on the iliacus, but, as it pro- ceeds distally, it inclines medially and thus it crosses posterior to the femoral artery, and comes to lie on the pectineus. Reaching the proximal border of the adductor longus, it passes posterior to that muscle, and is continued distally, close to the body of the femur, in front of the adductor brevis and adductor magnus. Numerous large branches spring from the profunda Fig. 76.—Muscle-Attachments to the Lateral Surface of the Os Pubis and Os Ischium.

Ultimately it is reduced to a fine terminal twig, which turns posteriorly through the adductor magnus, and receives the name of the fourth perforating artery. The following are the relations of the profunda femoris:—(i) It lies anterior to the iliacus to the lateral side of the femoral artery. (2) It is anterior to the pectineus and posterior to the femoral artery, but separated from it by the femoral vein and the profunda vein. (3) It is anterior to the adductor brevis, and lower down to the adductor magnus and posterior to the adductor

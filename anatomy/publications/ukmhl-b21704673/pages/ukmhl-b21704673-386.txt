354 ABDOMEN The bulb and the two crura together constitute the root of the penis, and each is provided with a special muscle, which at present hides it from view. Clothing the bulb the student will recognise a bipenniform muscle called the bulbo-caverfiosus, whilst moulded upon the surface of each crus is the ischio- cavernosus. These muscles should now be cleaned and their connections examined. Corpus cavernosum penis Ereclile tissue of bulb Urethra (divided) Bulb of corpus cavernosum urethrae Fascia covering bulb divided where it is continuous with the urogenital diaphragm Crus penis : surface at* tached to the pubic arch Fig. 133.—Dorsal or attached aspect of the Penis. The specimen was hardened by formalin injection and removed from the pubic arch and the triangular ligament. Superficial Perineal Muscles.—Under this heading are included not only the bulbo-cavernosus and ischio-cavernosus muscles, but also the superficial transverse perineal muscles. The superficial perineal muscles have been seen to lie within the pouch formed by the superficial fascia and the urogenital diaphragm. When the superficial fascia is removed each will be found to be invested by its own delicate aponeurotic layer. M. Transversus Perinei Superficialis.—This is a narrow slip of muscular fibres which arises from the medial aspect

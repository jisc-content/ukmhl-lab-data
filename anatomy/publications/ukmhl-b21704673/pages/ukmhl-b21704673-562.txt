53° ABDOMEN gland, the spleen, the stomach, and the pancreas are in contact with the upper inclined plane on the anterior surface of the left kidney. The suprarenal gland, as a rule, occupies a narrow district along the medial border from the level of the hilus to the summit of the organ. The spleen is in contact over an area immediately adjoining the outer convex border. The extent of this splenic field varies considerably in different subjects. The pancreas stretches across the left kidney either immediately above, or perhaps exactly over, the eminence which intervenes between the two sloping surfaces on the Superior vessels Ureter Left colic flexure (O.T splenic flexure) Fig. 206.—Relations of the Left Kidney and the Pancreas. anterior aspect of the kidney. The stomach is in contact with the left kidney over the triangular interval which is left be- tween the suprarenal gland, the spleen,* and the pancreas, and this surface is covered by peritoneum of the omental bursa. The inferior sloping surface on the anterior aspect of the left kidney presents a varying relation to the intestinal canal. Towards the lateral border of the organ is the descend- ing colon, whilst the remainder of this surface is in relation to the coils of the small intestine. Posterior Surface of the Kidney.—This surface is mapped out into a medial and a lateral district. The medial

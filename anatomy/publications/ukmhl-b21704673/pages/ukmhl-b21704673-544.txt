ABDOMEN 512 recess, likewise intervenes between the upper part of the spleen and the surface of the body. The remaining three surfaces are turned towards the cavity of the abdomen, and are closely applied to the viscera which support the organ in its place. These three surfaces, which may be grouped together under the one term visceral” are. separated from each other by three ridges which radiate from a blunt and often inconspicuous prominence which may be termed the intermediate angle, and represents the apex of the tetrahedron. One of these ridges, a salient and prominent Anterior angle Intermediate angle Fig. 197.—The Spleen (visceral aspect). border (margo intermedins), ascends to the upper end of the spleen and separates an extensive anterior gastric area from a narrower posterior renal area; a second short ridge or border passes backwards to the posterior angle and intervenes between the renal and the colic surfaces; whilst the third ridge, less distinctly marked, proceeds forwards to the anterior angle and separates the gastric and the colic surfaces from each other. The term colic surface is applied to a triangular area which is bounded by the two last-named ridges, together with the lower border of the organ. The facies gastrica is the most e.xtensive of the three visceral districts. It is deeply concave and moulded upon

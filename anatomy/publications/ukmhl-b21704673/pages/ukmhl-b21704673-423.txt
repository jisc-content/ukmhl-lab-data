391 ABDOMINAL WALL From these origins the muscular fibres radiate, but the general direction is from below upwards and medially. The posterior fibres ascend, and are inserted into the lower borders of the cartilages of the lower four ribs. These fibres occupy the same plane as the internal intercostal muscles—indeed, they will be observed to be directly continuous with the fibres of the internal intercostal muscles of the two lower spaces. The loivesi fibres, those springing from the inguinal ligament, arch downwards and medially,' and join with the lowest fibres Fascia of Scarpa Suspensory ligament penis Cord covered by sper- matic fascia Internal oblique Inguinal ligament Falx aponeur- otica inguinalis Cord covered by cremaster Subcutaneous inguinal ring Aponeurosis of internal oblique Reflex inguinal ligament Fig. 146.—Dissection of the Inguinal Region. The aponeurosis of the external oblique is ttirnecl down. of the transversalis in a flat tendon, called the falx inguiualis or conjoined te?idon, which is inserted into the pubic crest, and into the pecten pubis, behind the lacunar ligament and the reflex inguinal ligament, for fully half an inch of its extent (Fig.s. T42 and 146). The interfuediate fibres proceed upwards and medially, and end in a strong aponeurosis, which extends from the lower margin of the thorax to the pubis. By this aponeurosis they gain insertion into the lower borders of the cartilages of the seventh and eighth ribs and the xiphoid process, and into the linea alba throughout its entire length. The manner in which the aponeurosis reaches the middle line requires special description. I —2r, e

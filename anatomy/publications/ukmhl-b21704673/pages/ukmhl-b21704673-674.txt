ABDOMEN 642 fatty, vascular tissue previously mentioned as the parametrium. The opening of the lower end of the vagina into the urino- genital cleft is partly closed, in the virgin, by the hymen. This is formed by two antero-posteriorly placed crescentic folds which are united in front and behind. After the hymen has been ruptured, its torn fragments, called cariin- culcB hymenales, persist round the opening. Fig. 254.—The lower part of the Cervi.x Uteri, the anterior wall of the Vagina, and the Vestibule. The Vagina has been opened from behind. The Relations of the Vagina.—The posterior wall of the vagina is in relation above with the recto-vaginal excavation of peritoneum. Below this it is in apposition with the anterior wall of the rectum (Fig. 244). The anterior wall of the vagina is related to the lower part of the base of the bladder and to the urethra. The lower end of the vagina is embraced between the vestibular bulbs, and is clasped by the sphincter vaginee, and each lateral border is supported by the corre- sponding levator ani muscle. The anterior borders of the levatores ani muscles, as they pass backwards from the body Uteri e.xternum Cervi.\ uteri

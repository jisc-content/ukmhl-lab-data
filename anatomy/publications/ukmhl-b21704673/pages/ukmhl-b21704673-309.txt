THE LEG 277 mw- 3ft-; upon the medial aspect of the distal part of the tibia, also been dissected upon the medial aspect of the thigh and knee. It can now be exposed in its course along the medial side of the calf of the leg. It lies a short distance posterior to the medial border of the tibia. The sma// saphenous vein has been seen to arise from the lateral end of the dorsal arch and to pass proximally posterior to the lateral malleolus. It may now be followed, as it ascends along the lateral side of the tendo calcaneus, to the posterior aspect of the leg, where it lies over the inter- val between the twoheadsof the gastrocnemius muscle. When it gains the distal part of the fossa poplitea it pierces the deep fascia and joins the popliteal vein. Associated with each of these veins are certain It has Lumbar nerves. Lateral cutaneous branches of last dorsal and ilio«“ hypogastric Sacral nerves - Perforating cutaneous" Branches from posterior femoral _I5 cutaneous nerve Lateral cutaneous Perineal rami of posterior cutaneous nerve Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh Medial cutaneous Lateral cutaneous Medial cutaneous Peronaeal anastomotic nerve Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh ~|j M cutaneous nerves, which must be displayed at the same time. The posterior cutaneous ?ierve of the thigh is closely related to the small saphenous vein in its proximal part, and the sural nerve accompanies it in the distal half of the leg. In company with the great saphetious vein is the saphenous nerve.

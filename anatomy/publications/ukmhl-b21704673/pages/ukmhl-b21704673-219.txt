.87 THE THIGH two out of every five subjects the obturator artery, on one or on both sides, takes origin from the inferior epigastric artery. In these cases it passes posteriorly to gain the obturator sulcus in the upper part of the obturator foramen. According to the point at which it arises from the epigastric trunk, it presents different relations to the femoral ring. In the majority of cases it proceeds posteriorly in close contact with the external iliac vein and on the lateral side of the femoral ring. In this position it is in no danger of being wounded in operations undertaken for the relief of a strictured femoral hernia. In about thirty-seven per cent, however, of the Adductor brevis Femoral vein Great saphenous vein Femoral artery Lateral cutaneous nerve Profunda femoris artery* Lateral circumflex artery- inguinal ligament (Poupart’s) Superficial circumflex iliac artery Femoral nerve Superficial epigastric afid superficial pudendal arteries Deep external pudendal artery Intermediate cuta- neous nerve (O.T. middle cutaneous) Fig. 70.—Dissection of the Trigonuni Fenioralc. ca.^s, in which it exists, the artery is placed less favourably. In these, it either proceeds posteriorly across the septum femorale which closes the opening into the canalis femoralis, or it arches over it and turns posteriorly on the medial side of the ring upon the deep aspect of the base of the lacunar ligament. In the latter situation it is in a position of great danger, seeing that it is the base of the lacunar ligament against which the surgeon’s knife is generally directed for the relief of strictured femoral hernia. Dissection.—The femoral triangle may now be dissected. To bring its boundaries into view the deep fascia must be removed from the anterior aspect of the proximal third of the thigh ; in the distal two-thirds, the

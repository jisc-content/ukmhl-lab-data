370 ABDOMEN lies upon the side of the vagina close to its orifice. To obtain a good view of these muscles the superficial fascia of the labia should be dissected away. In cleaning the muscles the dissector should look for the small nerve twigs which are given to each by the perineal division of the internal pudendal nerve. Superficial Perineal Muscles.—The iransversus perinei super- ficialis has the same disposition as in the male, but it is rare to find it so well marked in the female.

It is a slender fasciculus which takes origin from the medial surface of the ramus of the ischium, close to the tuberosity, and passes obliquely forwards and medially to its insertion into the central point of the perineum. In the female the central point of the perineum is placed behind the vaginal orifice. The ischio-cavernosus is much smaller than the correspond- ing muscle in the male. It arises from the medial aspect of the ischial tuberosity, and is inserted by a tendinous expansion on the surface of the crus cliloridis.

74 THE UPPER EXTREMPPY in the proximal part, after the vein has pierced the fascia, it comes into closer relationship with the artery. The two venae comites are closely applied to the sides of the artery, and the numerous connecting branches which pass between them, both in front of and behind the artery, make the relationship still more intimate. Behind the brachial artery there are four muscles. From above downwards they are (i) the long head of the triceps which is separated from the artery by the radial nerve and the N. musculo- cutaneus ' N. medianus, N. cut. antib. med.

(4) In the remainder of its course the brachialis forms the posterior relation. With the exception of the musculo-cutaneous nerve all the terminal branches of the brachial plexus lie in relation to the brachial artery. The median nerve lies laterally and somewhat anteriorly in the proximal half of the arm ; it crosses anterior to the artery at the level of the insertion of the coraco-brachialis, and in the distal half of the arm and the cubital fossa it is to the medial side of the artery. The ulnar nerve and the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm lie close to the medial side of the artery as far as the

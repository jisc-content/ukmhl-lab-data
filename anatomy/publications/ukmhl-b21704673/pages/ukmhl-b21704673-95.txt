FRONT OF THE ARM 63 immediately behind and to the medial side of it. The humerus is thickly clothed by muscles; but towards its lower part the two epicondyloid ridges, leading down to the epicondylar eminences, may be felt. The lateral ridge is the more salient of the two, and therefore the more evident to touch. The bony points around the elbow require to be studied Fig. 25.—Relation of bones of Elbow to the surface.

It is by a proper knowledge of the normal relative positions of these that the surgeon is able to distinguish between the different forms of fracture and dis- location which so frequently occur in this region. First note the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This constitutes a prominence, appreciable to the eye; grasp it between the finger and thumb, and note that it inclines dorsally as well as medially. In a well-developed, fully extended arm, the lateral epicondyle does not form a projection on the surface, but can be felt at the bottom of a slight depression

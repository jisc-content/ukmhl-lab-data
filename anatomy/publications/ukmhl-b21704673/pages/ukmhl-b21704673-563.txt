ABDOMINAL CAVITY 531 district is the narrower of the two, and looks medially and backwards. It is in apposition with the psoas muscle and the crus of the diaphragm, and a rounded ridge, which corresponds to the angle between the planes of the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles, separates it from the lateral district. The lateral district looks backwards. In its upper third it rests on the diaphragm, and in its lower two-thirds upon the quadratus lumborum and the aponeurosis of origin of the transversus muscle. The upper end of the kidney curves slightly forwards in correspondence with the diaphragm on 1. Pancreas. 2. Splenic vein joining the portal vein. 3.

Inferior vena cava. which it lies, and it should be borne in mind that between the diaphragm and the last rib the pleural cavity descends behind the kidney for a short distance (Fig. 208). In spare individuals, when the kidneys have been hardened in situ, dimples, corresponding to the tips of the transverse processes of the first, second, and third lumbar vertebra;, and a shallow groove for the last rib, may sometimes be detected on the posterior surface of the kidney. A furrow corresponding to the arcus lumbo-costalis lateralis is also not infrequently to be seen on the posterior aspect of the kidney. The student should never experience any difliculty in determining the side to which a given kidney belongs. Even allowing that the upper end cannot be distinguished from the lower end, or the anterior surface from the posterior surface, by differences in their appearance (which is frequently the case in a dissecting-room kidney), the ureter 1—34 a

536 ABDOMEN pleural and peritoneal membranes are merely separated from each other by some loose areolar tissue. Through this gap the superior epigastric branch of the internal mammary artery descends into the abdominal wall. Posterior Aitach77ient. — d’he arcus lumbo-costalis lateralis (O.T. liganientum arcuatum externuvi) is a fibrous band which stretches from the last rib to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra. It arches in front of the quadratus lumborum, and is merely the thickened upper part of the fascia which covers that muscle, i.e. the antei'ior Fig. 211.—Posterior Surface of the Anterior Wall of the Thorax and Abdomen, to show the Costal and Sternal Origins of the Diaphragm on the left side.

The last dorsal nerve passes laterally and downwards under this ligamentous arch. The amis lumbo-costalis tuedialis (O.T. ligamentutti arcuatum ititernum) arches over the psoas magnus muscle, and, like the lateral arch, is simply a thickening of the fascia which covers the muscle. It is the stronger of the two, and is attached by one extremity to the tip of the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and by the other to the body of the second lumbar vertebra and the tendinous part of the corresponding crus of the diaphragm.

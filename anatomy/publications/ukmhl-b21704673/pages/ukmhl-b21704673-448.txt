4i6 ABDOMEN masses, called the co7ii vasculosi. Ultimately these ducts open into a single convoluted canal, termed the ductus epididymidis. The head of the epididymis is thus composed of the coni vasculosi and the coiled ductus epididymidis. The body and tail of the epididymis are formed of the continuation of the same canal coiled and convoluted upon itself to a remark- able degree. The intricacy of its flexuosities will be better understood by simply stating that if it were completely opened out it would be found to measure twenty feet or more. At the lower end of the cauda epididymidis the ductus epididymidis becomes continuous with the ductus deferens. Dissection.—The dissector should endeavour to unravel a part of the ductus epididymidis. The coils are held together by areolar tissue and the dissection is very tedious. Penis.—The penis has already, to a certain extent, been studied in the dissection of the perineum (p. 351). It has cavernosum penis ends in a blunt rounded extremity, which is covered by the glans penis. The corpus cavernosum urethree, when traced backwards into the perineum, expands into the bulb of the urethra which is attached, in the medial plane, to the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm ; traced forwards to the extremity of the penis, it is again found to expand into the glans penis., which fits like a cap upon the rounded end of the corpus cavernosum penis. 'I'he glans penis is somewhat conical in shape, and the projecting margin of its base is termed the corona glandis. 'I'he urethra opens at the extremity of the glans by a vertical fissure, called the meatus urinarius. Fig. 157.—Median section through the terminal part of the Penis. Urethra surrounded by the corpus cavernosum uretlirai been seen to be composed of the corpus cavernosum pans and the cotpus cavernosum urethrcr. Posteriorly, the corpus cavernosum penis divides into the two crura penis which are attached to the sides of the pubic arch ; an- teriorly, the corpus

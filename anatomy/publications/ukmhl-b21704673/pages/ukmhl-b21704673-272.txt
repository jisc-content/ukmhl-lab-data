INFERIOR EXTREMITY 240 the fossa it is placed upon their medial side. Its branches may be classified into cutaneous, muscular, and articular. The n. cutaneus surce f?iedialis is its cutaneous branch which arises about the middle of the fossa, and proceeds distally in the furrow between the two heads of the gastrocnemius. It will afterwards be seen to unite with the peroneal anastomotic nerve, a little distal to the middle of the calf of the leg, to form the sural nerve. The muscular branches supply both heads of the gastro- cnemius, the plantaris, the soleus, and the popliteus : they Bursa prepatellaris V. Vastus medialis S. Sartorius. S.M. Semimem- branosus. G. 1.

The branch to the popliteus requires special notice. It arises more distally than the others, and crosses the superficial surface of the popliteal artery to reach the lateral side of that vessel. It then runs distally on the posterior surface of the popliteus muscle, and gains the anterior surface by winding round the distal border. This will be better seen when the muscle itself is dissected. The articular branches are three in number. They are given off by the tibial nerve in the proximal part of the fossa, and they accompany the middle artery of the knee and the two medial genicular arteries. That which accompanies the inferior medial artery is larger than the other two, and can

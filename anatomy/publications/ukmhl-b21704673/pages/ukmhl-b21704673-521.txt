ABDOMINAL CAVITY 489 left with the ileum and the vermiform process. It is com- pletely surrounded by peritoneum and is supplied with blood by branches derived from the loop between the termination of the superior mesenteric artery and its ileo-colic branch. The Vermiform Process springs from the medial and posterior aspect of the caecum, about an inch below the ileo- csecal junction, and passes either upwards and to the left, towards the left hypochondrium, downwards into the pelvis across the right external iliac artery, or upwards behind the caecum and the ascending colon. It invariably occupies the Frenulum of valve Tainiae coli Anterior t*nia coli Upper segment of valve Frenulum of valve Orifice of ileum Inferior segment of valve Ileum Orifice of vermiform process Fig. 188.—Caicum which has been distended with air and dried, and then opened to show lleo-Caecal Opening and Valve. (Hirnungham.) last position if a retro-colic pouch is present. It is attached by a mesentery, the meso-appendix, to the posterior surface of the lower part of the mesentery of the ileum. Dissection.—Turn the ctecum upwards, remove the peritoneum from the wall of the iliac fossa behind it and clear away the extra-peritoneal fat. Note that the peritoneum and fat separate the emeum from the right psoas and iliacus muscles, and from the femoral nerve ((3.T. anterior crural) in the angle between them. The anterior surface of the ctecum is in rela- tion with the anterior wall of the abdomen or is separated from it by the lower part of the great omentum. Cut away a portion of the right lateral wall of the caecum and examine the ileo-caecal orifice and the orifice of the vermiform process from the interior of the intestine.

PELVIS 565 The lower part of the parietal layer should next be examined. In the dissection of the perineum the student saw that the lower part of the parietal pelvic fascia formed the lateral wall of the ischio-rectal fossa, and that it blended, immediately below the origin of the levator ani, with the lower layer of the fascia of the pelvic diaphragm which covers the lower surfaces of the levator ani and the coccygeus (anal fascia). He saw also that, in the anterior part of the peri- Bladder - Endo-pelvic fascia Obturator internus Prostate Prostatic urethra* Levator ani - Upper fascia of v'pelvic diaphragm Endo-pelvic fascia Bulbo-cavernosus covering the bulb of the urethra Pubic arch Deep transvers perineal muscle Inferior fascia of uro-. genital diaphragm Crus penis” Ischio-cavernosus- Scrotal vessels a . . nerves Fascia of Colies Sheath of prostate Lower fascia of pelvic diaphragm Parietal pelvic fascia ..

The endo-pelvic fascia is depicted in red. neum, the parietal fascia extended medially, as the superior fascia of the uro-genital diaphragm, from the margin of the I pubic arch to the side of the urethra, where it not only I blended with the fascia coming from the opposite side, but also became continuous, round the anterior border of the 'i levator ani, with the fascia on the upper surface of that muscle, that is, with the visceral layer of the pelvic fascia. ^ To display the details of the visceral layer of the fascia the final stages of the dissection of the perineum must now be completed.

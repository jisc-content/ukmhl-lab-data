• ARTICULATIONS 155 ( (2) for the distal radio-ulnar joint, {a) a capsule^ and (b) the 't discus articularis. j In addition there are other ligaments which pass between ^ ) the bodies of the two bones of the forearm, and are therefore r common to the two articulations, viz. the oblique cord and ^ the interosseous tnembrane. w To expose these ligaments the volar and dorsal muscles of the forearm must be completely removed. Ligamentum Annulare Radii (O.T. Orbicular Ligament). —This is a strong ligamentous collar which encircles the Olecranon Incisura radialis Transverse portion of lig. collaterale ulnare Incisura semilunaris Lig. annulare Processus coronoicleus Fig. 62.—Annular Ligament of the Radius. capitulum radii and retains it in the incisura radialis of the ulna. It forms four-fifths of a circle, and is attached by its extremities to the volar and dorsal margins of the incisura radialis. It is somewhat narrower distally than proximally, so that, under ordinary circumstances, the head of the radius cannot be withdrawn from it in a distal direction, and it is braced tightly upwards towards the elbow, and greatly strengthened by the anterior and posterior portions of the capsule of the elbow-joint, and by the radial collateral liga- ment which are incorporated with it along its proximal border. Its distal border is loosely attached to the neck of the radius by a prolongation of the stratum synoviale, which is covered externally by a thin layer of fibrous tissue.

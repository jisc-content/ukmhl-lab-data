'I'HE rillGli *93 inserted into the medial surface of the body of the tibia, posterior to the tuberosity (Fig. 92, p. 248). By its distal border this tendon is connected with the fascia of the leg, whilst by its proximal border it is joined to the capsule of the knee-joint. In its upper oblique part the sartorius muscle forms the lateral boundary of the femoral triangle, and lies anterior to the iliacus, the rectus femoris, and the adductor longus muscles. Distally, it is placed anterior to the femoral vessels as far as the opening in the adductor magnus. At its insertion its ex- panded tendon lies anterior and superficial to the tendons of M. vastus meclialis M. vastus interinedius M. sartorius Femoral vessels and n. saphenusin . adductor canal (Hunter’s) M. adductor Femur ISI. vastus lateralis Fig. 72.—Transverse Section through the Adductor Canal. insertion of the gracilis and semitendinosus, but is separated from them by a bursa. The sartorius is supplied by the anterior division of the femoral 7ierve. Canalis Adductorius Hunteri (Hunter’s Canal).—When the femoral artery leaves the femoral triangle it is continued distall)'; in the medial region of the thigh, in a deep furrow, which is bounded anteriorly by the vastus medialis muscle, and posteriorly by the adductor muscles. If this furrow be traced proximally, it will be seen to run into the deeper, wider, and more apparent hollow, which has been described as the femoral triangle. Further, this intermuscular recess is converted into a canal, triangular on transverse section, by a strong fibrous membrane which stretches across it, and upon the surface of which the sartorius muscle is i)laccd (Fig. 72).

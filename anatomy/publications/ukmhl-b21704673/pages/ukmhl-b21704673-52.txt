20 THE UPPER EXTREMITY several subordinate groups. Some of the glands have been removed as the dissection proceeded, and others are so small that they may have escaped the attention of the dissector, but if he has followed the directions given above he will have noted at least four groups of glands, (i) A lateral or brachial group consisting of six or more glands, which extend along the axillary vessels. They receive the lymphatics from ii' Cephalic vein M. pecloralis major M. deltoideus Chain o( glands related to the axill.ary vessels M. serratii.s anterior Central glands M. pectoralis minor Pectoral glands M. lalissiinus dorsi M. pectoralis Lymphatic vessels 1 to sternal glands Fig. 9.—The Lymph GInnds and Vessels of the Axilla and Mamma. h (From Poirier and Cuneo—modified.) 5 the greater part of the upper extremity, and those at the I upper part of the chain also receive lymph from the deep part of the mamma. (2) A pectoral group, or medial group, J which lies in the angle between the anterior and medial walls | i of the axilla. This is subdivisible into two parts: (a) an upper group of two or three small glands which lie beneath the pectoralis major in the region of the second and third l intercostal spaces—these receive lymph from the anterior wall * of the thorax and from the lateral two-thirds of the mamma; {/>) an inferior group which lies along the posterior border of

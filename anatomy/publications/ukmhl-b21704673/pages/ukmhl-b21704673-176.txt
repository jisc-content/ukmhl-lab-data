Each of these is lined by a special mucous sheath, to facilitate the play of the tendons within it. The different compartments may now be success- Fig. 57.—(From Luschka.) 1. Middle metacarpal bone. 2. Tendon of flexor sublimis. 3. Tendon of flexor profundus. I., II., and III. 4. Second lumbrical muscle. 5. Second dorsal interosseous muscle. 6. Extensor tendon. The three phalanges. ively opened up so that the arrangement of the tendons with reference to the dorsal carpal ligament may be studied. The first compartment is placed on the lateral side of the base of the styloid process of the radius, and corresponds with the broad obliciue groove which is present in this part of the

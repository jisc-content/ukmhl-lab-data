REVIEWS OF THE SECOND EDITION. “We think it the most useful surgical textbook for students we have recently seen.”—Bristol Mcdico-Chirurgical Journal. “ It is one of the best, if not the best, of the many textbooks of surgery for students to read.”—Binninghani Medical Review. “For all ordinary' purposes the most systematic English textbook on general surgery.”—Scottish MedicalJourmal. “ It is one of the most reliable and readable books the student or general practitioner could possess.”—Dublin Journal of Medical Science. “The teaching throughout is in complete accord with the late.st developments of surgical work.”—British Medical Journal. EARLY REVIEW OF THE THIRD EDITION JUST PUBLISHED. “ A more valuable work than the second edition, admirable though the latter was. I'o epitomize our criticism : It is a good general textbook, as full as it can reasonably be expected to be, up to date, concise and clear, accurate in its teaching, and, as such books ought to be, dogmatic. It is a book which deserves to be on the practitioner’s shelves, for it is one 0/ the best conaensaiions of modern surgical theofy and Jracticc ivith which we are acijuaintcd."—'fhe Hospital.

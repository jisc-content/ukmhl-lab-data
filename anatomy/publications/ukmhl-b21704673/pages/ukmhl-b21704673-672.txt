In niultiparae (women who have borne children) the anteflexion is not so marked as in nulliparae. The uterus possesses a great degree of mobility, however, and its position is constantly liable to change, but under no circumstances does it occupy an exactly median position.

When the bladder fills the uterus is raised, the anteflexion and anteversion become less marked, and, in cases of over-distension of the bladder, the uterus may assume an erect position, or may be even forced back-

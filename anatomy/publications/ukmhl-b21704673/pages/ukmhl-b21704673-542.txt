ABDOMEN Sio stitutes the pyloric sphincteric ring. The knob-like appear- ance presented by the extremity of the pyloric canal, when viewed from the interior of the duodenum, is produced by the presence, beneath the mucous membrane, of this muscular ring. The sphincteric cylinder which surrounds the pyloric canal varies much in its thickness in accordance with different degrees of contraction of the canal. The longitudinal muscle-fibres likewise form a thick layer on the superficial aspect of the sphincteric cylinder and ring. They are uniformly disposed around the pyloric canal, but Sulcus in- ' termedius Interior of pyloric canal Incisura angularis Sphincteric cylinder Duodeno-pyloric constriction Sphincteric ring Orifice of pyloric canal Interior of duodenum Sphincteric ring Duodeno-pyloric constriction Sphincteric cylinder Pyloric vestibule Fig. ig6.â€”Pyloric Canal and Pyloric Vestibule of the .Stomach opened up by section in the plane of the two curvatures. comparatively few of these fibres pass superficially over the duodeno-pyloric constriction to become continuous with the corresponding fibres of the muscular coat of the duodenum. As they approach the duodenum the deeper longitudinal fibres of the pyloric canal leave the surface and penetrate the substance of the pyloric sphincteric ring. There can be little doubt that by this arrangement an effective apparatus, antagonistic to the pyloric sphincteric ring, is provided, by means of which, when the sphincter relaxes, the pyloric orifice may be dilated. There is thus a constrictor and a dilator of the pylorus. In suitable specimens this arrangement of the muscle

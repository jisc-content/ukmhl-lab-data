137 FOREARM AND HAND M. biceps brachii M. supinator M. pronator teres munis and the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Closely accom- panied by the ex- tensor pollicis , viiM. . I . . I r M. triceps brevis it crosses the two radial extensors. The tendon which issues from it at this point is con- tinued distally over the lateral side of the ex- panded lowerend of the radius, and under cover of the dorsal carpal ligament. It is inserted into the lateral side of the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. This muscle is supplied by the dorsal interosseous nerve. M. Extensor Pollicis Brevis (O.T. Extensor Prtmi Internodii Pollicis). — This muscle is placed along the distal border of the pre- ceding muscle. It arises from a small portion of the dorsal surface of the radius, and also from the in- terosseous mem- brane. Its tendon is closely applied to that of the abductor M. flex carp, uln M.

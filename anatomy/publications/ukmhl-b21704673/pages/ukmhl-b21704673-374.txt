ABDOMEN 342 Reflection of Skin.—Two incisions are required :—(Fig. 127) (i) a transverse incision along the line which separates the anal from the urogenital triangle—i.e. in front of the tuberosities of the ischia ; (2) an incision at right angles to the first in the line of the median raphe. This incision should begin well forwards on the scrotum and be continued back a little beyond the point of the coccyx. The knife should be carried round the anus so as to encircle it. The four triangular flaps which are marked out should now be reflected. Some difficulty will be experienced in raising the skin. This is due to the presence of a number of fasciculi of involuntary muscle which radiate outwards from the anus. The term corrugator cutis ani is applied to this muscle. The stiperjicial fascia and the external sphincter jnuscle are now exposed. Fig. 128.—Outlet of Male Pelvis. Panniculus Adiposus (Superficial Fascia).—The student should examine the superficial fascia as it is spread over the entire extent of the perineal space. It shows great differences in character and texture in different positions. At the side of the anus it is remarkable for the large quantity of fat it holds in its meshes. This fat is soft and lobulated, and passes upwards upon each side of the anal canal in the form of a pliable and elastic pad. Over the tuberosities of the ischia the superficial fascia under- goes a striking alteration. Here it becomes tough and stringy; dense fibrous septa separate the lobules of fat from each other and connect the skin with the subjacent bone.

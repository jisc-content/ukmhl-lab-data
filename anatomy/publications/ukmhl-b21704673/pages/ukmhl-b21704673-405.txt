FEMALE PERINEUM 373 I—24 a corpus cavernosum. Posteriorly, opposite the lower part of the symphysis pubis, the corpus cavernosum separates into two parts, the crura clitoridis which diverge widely from each other. Each crus is attached by its deep surface to the rami of the pubis and ischium, and is covered by the corre- sponding ischio-cavernosus muscle. The clitoris, then, consists of three parts:—(\) a glans continuous with the pars intermedia; (2) a body, and (3) tivo crura attached to the sides of the pubic arch. It has been Central point of perineum Fig. 140.—Dissection of Female Perineum to show the Clitoris and the Bulb of the Vestibule. noted that the pars intermedia corresponds with the corpus cavernosum urethrae in the male. This apparatus in the female, therefore, closely resembles the penis in the male, the chief differences being the diminutive size of the clitoris, and the fact that the glans clitoridis is not perforated by the urethra. Dissection.—Detach the left crus clitoris from the side of the pubic arch and throw it aside. This dissection requires care, because the internal pudendal artery, the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, and the small artery which enters the crus, are very apt to be injured. The internal pudendal vessels and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris will be seen piercing the uro-

ABDOMEN 586 upper end, and pinch in its walls. The membranous part of the urethra and the bulb of the urethra are in front of the canal, but, on account of the backward inclination of the gut, they are separated from it by a mass of fibro- elastic tissue corresponding to the perineal body of the female. Behind the anal canal is the ano-coccygeal body (Symington). Vesica Urinaria (Bladder).—This is a hollow viscus, with strong muscular walls, which acts as a temporary reservoir for the urine before it is emitted from the body by the process of micturition. Its form, and, in a great measure, its position and relations, are influenced by the amount of fluid it contains and by the age of the subject. Fig. 232.—-Bladder hardened hi situ viewed from the right side. It contained a very small quantity of fluid. (A. F. Di.xon.) The different forms which the bladder assumes, under con- stantly changing conditions, render its description a matter of serious difficulty. As a rule it is found in the dissecting room with contracted walls and empty. For this reason, and also because our information regarding the empty bladder is more exact, the dissector should study, in the first place, the form it presents when in this condition, and afterwards consider the changes it undergoes as it becomes filled with urine. The following description is based upon the account given by Professor Dixon. The empty bladder lies completely within the cavity of the pelvis. It has the form of a triangular pyramid possessing nn apex, a base or fundus and three surfaces, viz.—a superior •and two infero-lateral surfaces. The fundus looks backwards towards the rectum, from which \

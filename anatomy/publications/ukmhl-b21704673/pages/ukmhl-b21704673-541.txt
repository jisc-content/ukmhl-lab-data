Then remove a segment of the wall of- the first part of the duodenum, and dissect it to display its structure. Pyloric Orifice and Pyloric Canal.—The extremity of the pyloric canal protrudes into the commencement of the duodenum, so that, when viewed from the duodenal side, it presents the appearance of a smooth, rounded knob, sur- rounded by a shallow furrow or fornix, and having a small puckered orifice, the pyloric opening, in its centre. The resemblance which it presents to the os uteri externum is very striking. When the stomach has been properly hardened m situ the pyloric orifice is almost invariably found tightly closed. It is only on rare occasions that the opening is patent. In such cases it is circular, and surrounded by a ring-like ledge Fig. 195.—Small portion of the Pyloric part of the .Stomach with part of Duodenum attached. which has been called the pyloric valve ; but it is doubtful if this is a natural condition. During life the pyloric opening may be regarded as being always rigidly closed, except during digestion when it opens intermittently, and at irregular intervals, to allow material to be squirted from the stomach into the duodenum. The muscular coat of the pyloric canal is modified to suit the requirements of this section of the stomach. It is provided with a powerful sphincteric apparatus. Both the circular and longitudinal muscular fibres are present in greater mass than in any other part of the organ. The circular fibres are disposed in the form of a thick sphincteric muscular cylinder which‘surrounds the entire length of the pyloric canal. At the duodeno-pyloric constriction the margin of this cylinder becomes increased in thickness, forming thereby the massive muscular ring which encircles the pyloric orifice and con- Orifice of pyloric canal of stomach Termination of pyloric canal protruding into duodenum Pyloric part of stomach

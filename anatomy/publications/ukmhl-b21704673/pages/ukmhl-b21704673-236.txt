204 INFERIOR EXTREMITY muscular septum, it takes origin. It is inserted into the patella through the medium of the common tendon. It is supplied by the femoral nerve. Common Tendon of the Quadriceps.—It should now be noticed that the common tendon of the quadriceps muscle closes the knee-joint above the patella. It is inserted into the proximal border of that bone, and is intimately connected with the capsule of the knee-joint. Some fibres are carried distally into the ligamentum patellae upon the surface of the patella. A pouch of synovial membrane is prolonged proximally beyond the level of the patella, between the quadriceps and the bone. Into the wall of this pouch the m. articularis genu is inserted. Dissection.—The vastus intermedius should be divided in a vertical direc- tion, so as to bring the little muscle articularis into view, and at the same time the long, slender nerve-filament which runs along the medial border of the vastus intermedius may be traced to the muscle and the synovial stratum of the knee-joint. The ligatnentum patellce, which connects the patella with the tuberosity of the tibia, and through which the quadri- ceps is attached to that bone, will be studied in connection with the knee-joint. The whole of the quadriceps femoris is an extensor of the knee, and the rectus portion is also a flexor of the hip-joint. MEDIAL SIDE OF THE THIGH. The group of adductor muscles on the medial aspect of the thigh, together with the blood-vessels and nerves associated with them, must next be dissected. In this dissection the following are the structures which are displayed:— ' Pectineus. Adductor longus. Adductor brevis. Adductor magnus. Gracilis. ^Obturator externus. / Profunda femoris (and its branches). \ Obturator. / The two divisions of the obturator nerve. \ Occasionally the accessory obturator nerve. Muscles, Arteries, Nerves,

But animal functions, he adds, generally speaking, are like nothing to be found in the works of art, or where there is not ani- mation and life; and had physiologists spent that time in making accurate observation upon animals themselves, which has been thrown away upon me- chanical and chemical visions, by this time we might have understood animal principles and processes much better than what we do now. To confirm this reasoning, I would here ask, if, without experiments or observations on the living body, mere chemical and mechanical reasoning could ever have informed us, that a new tail will grow to the lizard, and a new head to many of the mollusca after the old ones are struck off; or could they have foretold, that when the claw of a lobster, a crab, or a craw-fish is destroyed, the remaining phalanxes shall drop off at the fourth joint, and that then, the animal, by its vital powers, shall reproduce an

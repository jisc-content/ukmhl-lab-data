As the blood, however, on account of the valves, cannot return by these arteries back to the heart, we must necessarily look for some other channels by which it is again conveyed to the fountain. Now, by numerous experiments and observations, Harvey, an Englishman whose name should be dear to every anatomist, discovered that those branches of arteries which were large enough to convey red blood, trans- mitted it to branches that conveyed it back in an opposite direction, and that these last branches, by reiterated unions, formed large trunks, which re- turned the whole from all the parts to which the branches of the arteries had sent it. He also observed, that the whole of the blood was sent through the left ventricle of the heart to the system at large ; that the whole was returned by the retrograde vessels back to the right; that the right transmitted the whole to the lungs through the pulmonary artery ; that there it was received by retrograde vessels that conveyed it again to the left ventricle; and that the left conveyed it again to the aorta, or the pipe that distributes it through all the various parts of the system. This is the re- gular course of the blood, which is called circula-

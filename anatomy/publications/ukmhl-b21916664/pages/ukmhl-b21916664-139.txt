LECTURE FOURTH. 109 wax, which hardens upon cooling, and, supposing himself the first who made use of such a material in the way of injection, to secure the reputation of such an invention, sent one of his preparations to the Royal Society of London in 1672. His friend, Frederick Ruysch, carried the art to the highest per- fection to which it has arrived, made a number of valuable discoveries, and, by maceration, or rather corrosion, exhibited clusters of small vessels crowd- ed together, yet all in situation, and without any interposing substance. The numerous advantages that anatomy has de- rived from the art of injection, cannot well be de- scribed in a general Lecture. You will be fully j convinced of its use when we come to that part of the course which treats of the bloodvessels. From the general view of the discoveries made by dissection, we shall now proceed to enumerate those which have been made by the application of the mechanical and chemical philosophy, and shall I afterwards inquire, how far these are sufficient to explain the several phenomena of organized bodies. With respect to that branch of philosophy that is called Mechanical, the ancients could suppose no other way by which the appearances of material substances could be explained. So partial was Fy-

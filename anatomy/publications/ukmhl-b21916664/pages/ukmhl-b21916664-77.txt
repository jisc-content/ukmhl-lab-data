47 LECTURE SECOND. The claim of Athotis is supported by Eusebius and Africanus, as quoted by Syncellus, and their authority was the popular tradition of Egyptian priests, who, to raise their country in the estima- tion of the credulous Greeks, pretended to all that was learned and scientific. Hermes is known to have been the tutelary spirit of the pillars on which the writings of Egypt were in- scribed, and was therefore considered not only as the patron, but the inventor of their arts and sciences. But, as Hermes in Greece, Mercury at Home, and Thoth in Egypt, signified a pillar as well as a god, the writings of Hermes had a twofold meaning: they might either denote, simply, the writings inscribed on the pillars, or the writings of the god to whom these pillars were consecrated. The last was the sense in which the priests were anxious that the phrase should be understood: for, among the ancients, it was a more common species of fraud, to publish their writings under celebrated names, than, like the modems, to pilfer the writings that belong to another, and impu- I dently to publish them as if they were their own. By the writings of Hermes, we are then to under- stand the writings of the priests: and, indeed, we are told by Jambliclius and Galen,j" that every new f De Mysteriis Egyptiorum. Also Galen, Lib.

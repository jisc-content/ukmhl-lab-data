LECTURE FOURTH. 105 late Dr. Monro of Edinburgh, who, somehow or other, have warmly disputed about the merit of suggesting a thought that occurred to anatomists before they were born. Yet they both have had the merit of arranging the scattered ideas on the subject into a systemâ€”a merit of no inferior degree thought Dr. Hunter, when that merit was his own, but a merit implying no more than ordinary talents, when it was considered the only merit of Harvey. As this system of absorbents or lymphatic veins is the last great and leading discovery made in Ana- tomy by means of dissection, before we proceed to those which have been made by the application of geometry and chemistry, we shall take a view of the principal improvements that have been introduced in the way of demonstration. As verbal descrip- tions do not always convey accurate ideas of the things described, surgeons and anatomists early thought of supplying the defect by pictures or figures. This discovery, by some, has been ascribed to the celebiated Italian, Leonardo da Vinci, not only a philosopher, but a painter and anatomist, who lived about the time that engraving was in- vented, and died in the beginning of the sixteenth century; but, however great his merit might be in other respects, he is not entitled to this honour.

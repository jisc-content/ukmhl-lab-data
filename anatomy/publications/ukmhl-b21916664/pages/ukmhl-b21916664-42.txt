LECTURE FIRST. 12 ciculi which are regularly described, and have gotten names, reckoning classes sometimes as pairs, the number amounts to nearly 400. The branch of Anatomy which treats of these organs, is styled Myology; and to those who are anxious to found their treatment of luxation and fracture on the principles of science, and not on the precedents of ignorant empiricism, it holds out the most flattering prospects of distinction and eminence, by removing one of the greatest oppro- briums in the art of surgery ; while to those who are struck with the singular phenomena of ani- mal motion, and inspired with the true spirit of philosophy, are desirous to know by what kind of powers animals breathe, circulate their blood, and digest their aliment, or by what kind of mecha- nism, superior to human, they swim, walk, leap, and fly, in such an astonishing variety of ways, it is, without exception, the most instructive, and the most interesting part of the science. As the muscles, however, are only the imme- diate organs of motion, we must still proceed in our inquiries, and try to discover from what source they derive their energy. On minute examina- tion, we soon learn, that certain white filaments, or ropes, not only enter the different muscles, but

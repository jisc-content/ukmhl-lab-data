COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 139 elephant may not use his proboscis, the swallow his bill, and the beaver his teeth ;â€”or we dissect them, in order to know whether functions and instincts, specifically different, may not be connected ; and particularly where voluntary organs are concerned, with forms and structures remarkably similar, as we see on comparing the toad and the frog, the hare and the rabbit, the carrion and the granivorous crow, and various species of the same genus, dis- tinguished more by habits and instincts, than by obvious features of form, or of structure; a circum- stance that naturally occasions this reflection, that a difference of habit, disposition, and instinct, may as often originate from insensible causes as from many of those prominent characters that forcibly obtrude themselves upon our senses. Lastly, we are led to extend our inquiries to every genus and species of animals within our reach, when we wish to be informed respecting the beautiful gradations in nature, to draw conclusions with regard to the animal kingdom at large, or to ascertain whether the fossil-remains of animals belong to the species that now exist, or to genera and species that have long been extinct: An in- quiry, that naturally and necessarily carries us into geology, to consider the past revolutions of the

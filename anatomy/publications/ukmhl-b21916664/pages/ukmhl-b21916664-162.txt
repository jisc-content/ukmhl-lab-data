General knowledge alone can fully prevent these ridiculous prejudices, that naturally arise from al- lowing the mind to be wholly engrossed with a fa- vourite science. In that situation a man must ne- i â€¢ cessarily see things through a false medium. The chemist can only see his affinities, the geometrician his mechanical laws, and both must resemble the blind man, who, judging of visible objects by the ear, concluded that colours were a species of sounds, and from what he heard of the nature of scarlet, ima- gined it something like the blast of a trumpet; nor was this misapplication of a sense attended with more palpable absurdity, than the application of one science to explain and illustrate the principles of another. It is a most singular and curious fact in the his- tory of anatomy, that geometry, chemistry, and the vital principle of Helmont and Stahl, have all three been occasionally rejected from philosophy, because each in their turn, when they got into power, as- pired at the most despotic authority, attempted to

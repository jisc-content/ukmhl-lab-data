His pupil, dissatis- fied with this explanation, could not help suspect- ing that they performed' a different office, and of much more importance. Having, therefore, taken his degree at Padua, and returned to England, he became anxious to resume the subject. According- ly, procuring a numer of animals, and opening them alive, he, at last, completely ascertained the func- tions of the venous membranes, which, from forcing the blood always to flow in the same direction, in the same vessels, he denominated Valves: and thence was led, as he told Mr Boyle, to the noblest discovery that is known in anatomyâ€”the circula- tion of the blood. It was made public in 1628, and I need not mention the great changes which it necessarily introduced into all our reasonings on the animal economy. The consequences which it had with respect to himself, are not, perhaps, so gene- rally known. Who could have imagined that the first effects of a discovery, which has since procured him the epithet Immortal, could have been a considerable

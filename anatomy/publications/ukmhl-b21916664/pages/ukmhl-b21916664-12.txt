LIFE OF DR. BARCLAY. II education at the parish school of Muthil, under Mr. Thomson, who had the reputation of being an ex- cellent Latin scholar, and to whom we have accidentally seen a copy of the Doctor’s Thesis ad- dressed in grateful and affectionate terms. In November 1776, Dr. Barclay was entered as a student at the Old College of St. Andrew’s, having gained by competition what is termed a Founda- tion Bursary, and having been placed at the head of the list of four successful candidates. Here he gave early proofs of an acute and inquiring mind, was greatly distinguished in the Greek class un- der Professor Hill, and made himself speedily master of Euclid’s Elements and of the Conic Sections. At St. Andrew’s he passed altogether five sessions, and, while prosecuting his theologi- cal studies at the New or St. Mary’s College, he acquired, without the aid of any teacher, such a knowledge of the Hebrew language as enabled him to read and understand the whole of the He- brew Bible, which he did before he became a preacher. About this period he wrote for his own instruction, or perhaps with some view to publi- cation, what he termed a History of all Religions j and this is said, by a very competent judge, to have been full of interesting information; but as no trace of such a work was found amongst his pa- pers, it is probable that he had abandoned any idea of giving it to the world, and had destroyed the manuscript.

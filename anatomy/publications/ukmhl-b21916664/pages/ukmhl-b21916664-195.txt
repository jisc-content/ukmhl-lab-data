COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 165 new fluid, a most powerful and general agent in nature ? and who, even then, could have anticipated the consequences that followed, that by this fluid, Sir Humphrey Davy should have been enabled to dis- cover a number of other substances, likewise gene- ral agents in nature, and by such discoveries an- nihilate a number of favourite theories, and establish a new era in chemistry ? It would be easy to enu- merate more, and a great many more, that have been made in a similar manner, and thrown much light upon Physiology. But though such discoveries have frequently been of the greatest utility, and can never be expected in forming a hypothesis, or in re- tailing the experiments of others, 1 would not re- commend Comparative Anatomy merely from the hopes of occasionally stumbling on them. Compa- rative Anatomy is different from a mine of gems or a lottery. Independent of these casual dis- coveries, many of which may still be reserved for future inquirers, it never fails to afford adequate and certain rewards, to every one that with zeal and spirit turns his attention to it. It affords clear and ocular demonstration that all animals are constructed on the same general outline, and only varied as to class, order, genus, and species.

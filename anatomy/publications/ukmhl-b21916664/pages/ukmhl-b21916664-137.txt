LECTURE FOURTH. 107 microscope. It was first used by the accurate Eus- tachius, afterwards employed by Grew and Malpi- ghi, in illustrating the structure and economy of plants, and also by the latter in demonstrating parts of the animal system. To this instrument we are indebted for many discoveries of Swammerdam, Liewenhoeck, Baker, Trembley, Lyonet, and Bon- net, and for two or three foolish and absurd theo- ries that are evidently founded on optical decep- tions, particularly a theory of animalcula in the se- minal fluid; of muscular motion, founded on the structure of the ultimate fibres ; and a third about the intimate structure of nerves. The last improvement which I shall mention of this kind, is the art of Injection.* It had always been found a tedious operation to dissect proper- ly the smaller branches of collapsed bloodvessels. Some assistance was therefore necessary; and, for that reason, Jacobus Sylvius, the master of Vesa- lius, was wont to fill them with a coloured liquor. Eustachiusf adopted a similar plan in examining * With respect to injections, see Portal, Vol. I. p. 633-4-G Vol. II. p. 261.

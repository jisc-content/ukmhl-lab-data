8 LECTURE FIRST. or branches, to be afterwards described, are about nine. As the rough surfaces, however, of bones, will not allow them to move on one another without great friction, in all cases where motion is either frequent or extensive, there ought to be some inter- vening substance. We accordingly observe, in the recent subject, that all those articulating surfaces, where any extensive motion takes place, are covered with a smooth and elastic substance, of a pearl colour, known in our language by the name of Gristle, but in Anatomy, by that of Cartilage,â€” a substance which, independent of its smoothness, is lubricated by a fluid that is called Synovia, and which performs, to the different joints, the same office that oil does to a piece of machinery. As the bones, however, must be restricted in their range of motion, we must also suppose, that there are means by which that end is to be accom- plished. Upon inspection, we perceive that some are prevented from changing their relative situa- tion by certain modes of articulation; while others, where a slight motion is permitted, are united by cartilage; and others, where extensive motion is allowed, connected by ligaments, membranes, or flesh.

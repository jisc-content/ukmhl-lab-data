17 LECTURE FIRST. il l 1 ' a ii cavities or ventricles are enlarged, and the blood flows in ; when it contracts, the ventricles are dimi- nished, and their blood propelled into two large pipes, the one leading directly to the lungs, and the other to all the rest of the system. These two pipes are named Arteries, and as they likewise have a muscular power, and at the same time are very elastic, by contractions similar to those of the heart, they propel the blood towards their ex- tremities, while a valvular apparatus, at their com- mencement, prevents it from returning by the same channels back to the heart. For the more minute distribution of their blood, these two arteries are branched or ramified, while the branches proceeding from the same trunk are frequently observed to unite in their course, and ob- viously with this intention of nature, that when some are obstructed, the parts may be duly supplied by the others with which they communicate, or, as we speak in the language of Anatomy, with which they inosculate or anastomose, the number of branches into which the two arteries divide, is de- i cidedly beyond all computation. It is only the lar- ger and the least numerous that are traced by the ' eye, even when assisted by a powerful microscope, and of these, only the more regular are dignified c

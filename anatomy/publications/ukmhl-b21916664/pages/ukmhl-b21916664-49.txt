While the blood in the arteries regularly flows from trunks to branches, in the retrograde vessels, with only one exception,, it as regularly flows from branches to trunks. These retrograde vessels are distinguished in anatomy by the name of Veins ; they are still more numerous than the arteries; are i usually found lying by their sides ; are described by nearly similar names ; have a much less muscular power; and as they are not assisted by the heart in - propelling the blood, as happens to be the case with • the arteries, they open to it larger and larger chan- nels as it advances* and have valves at different parts of their course to prevent its reflux. But here the young anatomist will say, that this < is no explanation at all of what we pronosed ; for, if ! the arteries transmit the whole of their blood to the veins, and the veins return it back to the heart, how are the different organs to be nourished ? The observation is certainly just; and, in order to ac- l count for the nourishment of the system, we must > necessarily suppose, that certainly some branches of j arteries wander fr°m the course of this circulation, and terminate otherwise than in venous branches.

134 LECTURE FOURTH. I have now finished this introductory part of the course, in which you have had a general view of the animal system, and seen a sketch of the leading discoveries made in anatomy, with the arts and sciences, that have contributed to their improve- ments. As a preparation, and to give an interest to those minute and detailed descriptions, on which we are to enter, I thought it necessary. The prin- cipal facts will be highly useful, as heads of arrange- ment, in collecting your future ideas on the subject; and, if you observed that I ventured at times to mark the limits, within which the auxiliary sciences ought to be confined, you must not understand me, as if I meant to lay any restriction upon you. As your knowledge increases, you will think for your- selves ; I wish you by no means to subscribe im- plicitly to my opinions—such unbounded confidence could do no good to me—it would not reflect any credit on your own understandings, and it never would promote the interest of the science, which with you and with me ought to be the great object at heart.

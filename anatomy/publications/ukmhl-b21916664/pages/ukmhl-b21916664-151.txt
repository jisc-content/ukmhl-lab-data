This species of heat is diffused through all nature, is the source of fluidity through- out the universe, is in a sensible or latent state, in- timately combined with every other body, and even with the air, which, according to him, is the coldest of all bodies. This air, by its tenuity, and that heat with which it is combined, furnishes the vital spirit to animals ; while the lungs, by their spongy texture, are admirably calculated to receive and dis- tribute it through the system by respiration.‚Äù From this language of Cicero, one might at first be in- clined to believe, that he was acquainted with latent heat, and that the evolution of this heat, in passing through the lungs and the bloodvessels, was the principal cause of animal temperature. But his random expressions are so vague, and so evidently founded upon the hypotheses of the stoical philo- sophy, that we must, in justice, ascribe this dis- covery to a later period. Our countryman, Mayow*, was the first who had accurate ideas on the subject; he proved from a number of well-conducted chemical experiments. * Dr. Hooke has likewise some claim.

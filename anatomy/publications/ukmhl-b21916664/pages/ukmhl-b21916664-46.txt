LECTURE FIRST. 16 of air, the blood could neither nourish the parts nor support life. Such then being the fact, and the heart the great fountain of the blood, we must ne- cessarily suppose that it will send some to the lungs, in order to receive that supply of air which had been long and vaguely conjectured, but by Mayow demonstrated, if not to be the only, at least to be the principal support, and regulating cause of ani- mal temperature. In man accordingly, and in eve- ry other animal with warm blood, we perceive no less than a double heart, or at least two cavities that are named ventricles, one for transmitting blood to the lungs to receive air, and the other for distri- buting it afterwards through the system, and even to the heart and the lungs themselves, for the pur- pose of nourishment. The young anatomist will very naturally be anxi- ous to know, what is the cause of the constant and impetuous flow of the blood. To meet his inquiries, it must be remembered that the heart is a muscle; that through the influence of its nervous energy, it is made to contract and relax, alternately, more than 60 times in a minute, and, at that rate, most singu- lar to tell, without either pain or fatigue during the whole period of existence, be that protracted to 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 years. When it relaxes, its two

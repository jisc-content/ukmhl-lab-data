122 LECTURE FOURTH. that the air was a compound, and that it was only one of its constituents that supported life. He proved likewise, that the same constituent, and no other, supported combustion, and that the tempera- ture of animals was nearly in proportion to the quan- tity of air which they respired. From these facts he concluded, that the function of respiration was the principal cause of animal heat. On observing that the same aerial constituent, which supported combustion and animal life, was what converted potash into nitre, he chose to call it nitrum aereuin, or aerial nitre, in order to distinguish it from the nitrate of potash, which, in his language, is the ni- trum fixum, and, at the same time, from the nitric acid, which, in his language, is the nitrum acidum. Observing farther, that the nitrum fixum, or nitrate of potash, changed the colour of the blood from black to red, he endeavoured to explain the change of co- lour which the blood undergoes in passing through the lungs. In that passage, he supposed it to com- bine with his nitro-aerial particles, from the air which we breathe; and knowing that a regular and constant supply of fresh air is necessary to life and the due performance of the different functions, he inferred, that this regular supply of his nitro-aerial particles was the principal intention of respiration.

Since that period, every anatomist has seen the importance of Comparative Anatomy, and been forced to acknowledge, that scarcely a problem in physiology can be solved without it; and it must be obvious, that every organ should be accurately examined in varieties of form, connection, structure, and relative position, before we can venture to assert with confidence, what is essential, or what is not essential to its functions. At one time, ana- tomists were surprised to find a liver on the left side, as if the liver upon that side could not perform its functions as well as upon the right.

LECTURE SECOND. 31 Another reason for appealing to the structure of various animals, is, that by confining our researches to one species, we might be apt to ascribe too much to the form, size, structure, and situation of organs but, by examining different animals, we soon learn that similar functions may be performed by or- gans of various forms, magnitudes, proportions, si- tuations, and structures, or should the functions happen to be varied according to the organs, we are led to a very useful inquiry, not only how far the variety of function, but of genius, habits, instincts, and manners, is connected with each variation of the organs. Thirdly, Without the aid of Comparative Anato- my, we might often be induced to entertain false con- ceptions of the relative importance of the different organs ; but when we see them imperfect in one ani- mal, wanting in another, diseased, obliterated, or ex- tracted, m a third, with or without any essential in- jury to life, we have then criteria by which we may be able to form some judgment of that rank which they hold even in the human species. Fourthly, Comparative Anatomy becomes ne 'cessary in ascertaining the action of organs. All the functions have long ceased before the human body can legally be opened; and it is only in the lower animals that we can presume

LECTURE FOURTH. 108 an opinion that they were branches of the same system with the lacteals of Asellius, they were named by Bartholine, vasa lactea, and, from the nature of the fluid which they contained, vasa se- rosa, vasa lymphatica, and ductus aquosi. The great importance of these discoveries was generally acknowledgedâ€”the difficulty of making them can only be conceived by those who are somewhat ac- quainted with the subject. The lymphatics or lac- teals can scarcely be seen, even with the microscope, but when they are distended with fluids ; and they seldom contain any fluids at all, except during the life of the animal, or a short time after its death. We ought not, therefore, to be much surprised if they escaped the observation of anatomists for so many ages, nor wonder, when the lymphatics were discovered, that physiologists should have found it difficult to assign their use. The lacteals of Asel- lius spoke for themselves : they were the channels by which nourishment was conveyed into the system. But what nourishment could vessels convey that arose from the very points of the extremities ? Among various opinions, it was thought by Rud- beck and Bartholine, themselves, that, by suction or absorption, they were meant to convey back to the heart, all the fluids that had flowed in the smaller

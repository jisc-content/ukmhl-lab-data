Lastly, Comparative Anatomy is an object of im- portance ; considered by itself, it can be practised at all times, and in all places, with very little inconve- nience or obstruction. By it a person may readily acquire a facility in dissection, a dexterity and con- fidence in surgical operations, and not only preserve, hut extend the knowledge which he has acquired of the human system. Above all, it is found of singu- lar utility in natural history; it there lays open an extensive field of useful inquiry, and, every day, be- comes a source of, not only delightful, but endless amusement: it not only shews us how to examine the structures of animals with our own hands, but if we be fond of works on Zoology, it comes forward like a friendly interpreter, explains a great number of phenomena which otherwise we could not possibly comprehend ; presents before us a wide range of ani- mated beings, infinitely varied in form, magnitude, and colour, in strength, instincts, habits, and man- ners, yet all exhibiting a number of the same com- mon functions, and all proving that our generic and specific distinctions are only branches of the same

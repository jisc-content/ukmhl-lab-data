LECTURE SECOND. 42 In my opinion, by that patient and accurate dis- section which displays the structure. By calling to our aid the mechanical philosophy which illustrates the general properties of matter. By applying likewise to the chemical philosophy for an explanation of these properties that belong to certain combinations of matter : And By diligent inquiry into the cause or causes of * those phenomena that characterise living organized systems of matter. From these sources has the whole of our present information been derived; and I now shall proceed, as a general, and, I think, as an useful preparation for that course on which we are to enter, to mention some of the principal discoveries which each of them has furnished, and to point out, at the same time, those particular departments in which each, under a prudent management, may be made instrumental in leading to improvement and to future discoveries. Observing the order in which they have been mentioned, I shall begin with a general account of the principal discoveries made by dissection. It were to be wished that the history of this part of anatomy were better understood. Ignorance here has not only retarded the progress of the science, but, unfortunately, combined with selfishness and

Such are a few of the common specimens of that kind of knowledge, which some physiologists would have us to renounce for what Dr. Hunter not improperly denominates, their chemical visions. I hope it is A unnecessary to warn you of the consequences. As the living principle has already become the subject of experiment and observation, and methods pointed out by which its properties, its powers, its functions, and its modes of action may be ascertained, I shall leave you to judge how far it is proper to turn from a field of such useful inquiry, merely because the fashionable vulgar, among our physiologists, do not countenance it. But such opposition has not been peculiar to the vital principle: the circulation discovered by Harvey was hooted and ridiculed in the same way, because the fastidious pride of ana- tomists, the fashion of the day, and their tender at- tachment to their own theories, would not permit them to examine the facts on which it was founded. Even chemistry itself, now so vainly proud of her physiology, experienced at one time a similar treat- K 2

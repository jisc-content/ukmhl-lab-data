COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. 167 us with instances, numerous and diversified, where similar functions are connected with quite different organs, and similar organs with different functions. The philosopher would err, who, from cursorily ex- amining the outward form, or internal structure of the hare and the rabbit, should thence imagine that they have similar instincts and habits. He would err if he thought that the same individuals might not have very different instincts at different times, when they watch over and provide for their offspring, and when they repel them, cease to care for them, or even to know them. He who has studied the singular varieties of the human character, will cer- tainly admit these must depend much less on any visible changes of the organs than upon the agent that secretly directs them and remains un- seen. Even many changes may take place in the organs, and, by their reaction on the ruling agent, ' occasion many peculiar sensations, that cannot be traced up to their origin. Thus, what can be the cause that every individual of the same species emits a peculiar variety of effluvia, but some difference in the action of the organs ? a difference, however, which we never can detect, either by dissection or by chemical tests, and should never have supposed.

LECTURE FIRST. 15 must be obvious to every candid observer who takes but a transient view of the subject. Yet growth and nutrition necessarily pre-suppose a supply of nourishment: Whence then is this nourishment derived, and by what means is it conveyed to the i several organs ? Upon examining the animal structure, we find, that the only possible and immediate source of this nourishment, must be the blood, which flows by a thousand various channels into all the different parts of the system. This blood, by rest, spontaneously separates into two parts, a solid and a fluid; the solid again, by a slight pressure, likewise into two; while chemical analysis has shown, that each con- tains a considerable variety of ingredients. All have remarked the singular colour of this 1 fluid. An English anatomist of the name of Lower, observed that it got a shade of this colour in the lungs, or in those organs by which we breathe ; while Mayow, another English anatomist, endeavoured to prove that it is the air regularly inspired into these organs that give it this shade.* At any rate, experi- ence has shown, that, without this regular supply * In the incubated egg, the blood is red, before the heart or the lungs become visible.

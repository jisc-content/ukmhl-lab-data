20 LECTURE FIRST. The truth is, we find that various series of branches belong to the arteries ; that those composing the ultimate series are so minute as not to admit the red and grosser parts of the blood ; that many are destined to convey only the thinner portion of this circulating fluid ; and that many of these, wander- ing from the circle, empty themselves into bones, muscles, ligaments, and nerves, and the other parts of which the animal fabric is composed; when there, each part, by a vital process that is called Assimila- tion, converts this fluid into a substance of its own specific character and properties. We observe farther, that some of this last series of arteries open on the surface, where they exhale perspirable matter; others on the central aspect of the lungs, exhaling that vapour which appears in the breath ; that others again, for various purposes, pour out their fluids into the different cavities of the system, and many into bodies of various shapes, sizes, and structures, which anatomists have chosen to call Glands, and in which the fluids of these ves- sels are, by certain processes, changed into fluids of a different quality ; some of these, to lubricate the joints and the parts in motion ; some to assist in preparing the aliment and promoting digestion; some to protect the skin and the surface; some a fluid, employed as a means to generate the species ; and

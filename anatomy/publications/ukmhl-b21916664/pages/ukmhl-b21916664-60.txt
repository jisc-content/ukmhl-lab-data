LECTURE SECOND. 30 For the sake of illustration, and of those gentle- men who may wish to acquire more extensive ideas of the animal economy, or even of living bodies in general, 1 shall occasionally introduce Comparative Anatomy, and, where the analogy seems to be strik- ing, point out the structure and functions of plants. But, in order to prevent confusion and error, I shall at all times keep in my view the human body, as the standard or scale by which the size, form, si- tuation, and proportions are to be estimated. By a steady adherence to this plan, it is to be hoped that our principal object will be better illustrated and understood, our ideas accumulate without con- fusion, and become general without being vague. In many respects this comparison is necessary. All living bodies with which we are acquainted, are constructed on one general plan, possess similar, at least analogous, organs and functions ; and being mo- dified only as to class, order, genus, and species, con- tribute much to illustrate one another. In one animal, for instance, the organ is small, its structure complicated, or its use obscure; while, in another, this organ is large, its structure simple, and its use obvious. So that many discoveries which are now made in human anatomy, would have still been un- known, had they not been previously made in the comparative.

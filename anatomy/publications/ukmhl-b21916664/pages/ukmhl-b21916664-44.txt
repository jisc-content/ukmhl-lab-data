LECTURE FIRST. 14 many instances cannot be traced; the number de- scribed depends much on the taste and dexterity of the anatomist. The trunks themselves, issuing from the brain and the spinal marrow, reckoning them in pairs, are about 40, and in tracing both them and their branches, we observe them, in cer- tain definite places, swelling into knots, which are called Ganglia, or forming networks, which are nam- ed Plexuses. The 40 pairs of trunks, with their pairs of branches, ganglia and plexuses, dignified with names, are above 100. The branch of ana- tomy which treats of these organs, is styled Neu- rology. Having thus seen how the bones are articulated,— by what kind of substances they are connected,—by what organs they are put in motion,—and from what source their motion is derived, we have next to in- quire, how they and the other organs enumerated, increase in bulk, advancing gradually from the pe- riod of conception, when the whole make scarcely a visible speck, to that size which they afterwards ex- hibit in maturer years. That a vital power, totally distinct from any that is known in chemistry or me- chanics, constructs and arranges the different or- gans, and regulates, from the very dawn of our existence, all the processes of growth and nutrition.

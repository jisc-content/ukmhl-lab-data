LECTURE FOURTH. 123 viate an objection that arose from the general opi- nion of his time,â€”that the motion of the lungs, in- duced by respiration, was chiefly designed to pro- mote the circulation, he observed, that the circu- lation of the foetus was carried on without any as- sistance from the lungs, and that though our breath- ing be suspended for a while, the pulse does not stop. His nitro-aerial fluid was afterwards discovered in a separated state by the celebrated Priestley, and, after assuming different names, is now distinguished by that of Oxygen, or Oxygenous Gas. By the known properties of this gas, and by his discovery of latent heat, the late Dr. Black was able to throw additional light upon respiration and animal heat. From this simple statement of facts, it must be obvious how much physiology is indebted to the chemists ; and it is natural to expect, that much ad- ditional and valuable information may yet be derived from their future labours, provided they continue within those bounds which nature has prescribed to their researches. But, as chemical science can no more explain the properties of a circle, than mathe- matical reasoning the effervescence of an acid and alkali, they ought to recollect, that every science has its limits, and can only be useful when it is con-

LECTURE FOURTH. Ill produced a great force by a small effort, and that she did so by certain levers or mechanical powers, supposed to exist in the muscles or tendons. Bo- relli showed that no such power existed in either; that the bones, in general, were the levers of the muscles ; and that these levers were of a very differ- ent form from what had been imagined. In short he demonstrated, from the general direction and ob- liquity of the muscles, with respeetto the bones, from the place of their insertions near to the joints, and from the situation of these insertions between the fulcrum and the resistance, that nature was prodigal of muscular power, and, instead of produc- ing a great force by a small effort, did not unfre- quently employ a force a hundred times greater than the resistance which she had to overcome. Having thus ascertained the nature of the levers, he proceeded next to calculate the strength of the different muscles, and found that many which scarcely support the weight of the lever in the dead body, do yet, in the living, exert a force equal to some thousands of pounds. All these conclusions are drawn from data universally admitted ; but he had an opinion with regard to the structure of the muscular fibre, that makes their force almost incredi- ble. On this hypothesis he makes the force of

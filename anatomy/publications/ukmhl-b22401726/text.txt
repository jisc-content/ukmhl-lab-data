A Child at the full Period, just in the State in which it was delivered; having no Covering to the Abdominal Viscera. The Case is attached to the Preparation. See also a Cast of this Pre- paration. (From Mr. .) A 2$. A Monstrous Child, brought into the World, 25th June, 1794. The Mother was a poor Woman at Evesham in Worcestershire; she was 33 Years of Age and had Six Children before. Nothing particular happened during her Preg- nancy with this. She had, of course, a very laborious time, but recovered perfectly. She felt the Child alive when taken in Labour, and it would probably have been born alive if she had had medical aid sooner. A Surgeon of Droitwich, near Evesham, bought it for Three Guineas, and sold it to a Person in this Town for 250 Guineas, of whom I bought it, 1797. See a Cast of this Monster to the right below. A 24. A double-bodied Human Monster, having only one Head. A 25. An Extra-uterine Foetus, which had grown to the Size of a Fifth or Sixth Months’ Pregnancy. The Tube and Ovarium are sound on the op- posite Side; and within the Uterus which is clearly thickened, we see evidently that some Process has been going on, like an Efflores- cence or Separation of an inner Coat from the Uterus.

Integuments of the Thigh from a Child born at se- ven Months. The Mother about the fourth Month of Gestation was walking on the Ice, and was alarmed by feeling it crack under her. It is presumeable the Impression from Terror was transferred from her own Skin to that of the Foetus in Utero, leaving a permanent Dis- position to Contraction : for the Child was born covered with Cicatrices, the Skin having been universally torn and rent asunder. In various Situations the new Skin was pretty dense, in some Parts very thin and transparent, while in others it had not yet covered the Wounds. The Effect of this Process on the Forehead was the Retraction of the Palpebrse to that Degree, that the Eyes were staring wide as if without Eyelids. By Mr. H. K 2132 Morbid Anatomy.— Vermes. A a.

This Preparation stands at the West End of the Room on ac- count of its Size. By Mr. H. The Uterus of a Woman who died with peritonseal Inflammation 14 Days after Delivery. The Child had reached its full Time, but had been dead nine Days when extracted by the blunt Hook. From the Woman’s own Account it appeared that in probability the Child had been destroyed by the increasing Pressure from hardened Faeces and Costiveness in tire Parent. From Mr. FI. A very large encysted Dropsy of the Ovarium, which I tapped many Times. This is at the West End of the Room. Miss P. The Uterus and Appendages from a Lady, aged 27, who died of Hydrothorax a few Weeks after her first Accouchement. The Appearance is that of there being only a single Ovarium so much larger than ordinary, as to be well cal- culated to do the duty of two; but on closer Inspection there is a perceptible Attempt to form a second Ovarium, although it is exces- sively small, and must have been useless. Pre- sented by Mr. H. Q. Tumors from the Head. A Tumor removed from the Scalp. A Tumor from the Scalp, given me by Dr. J. 1796.

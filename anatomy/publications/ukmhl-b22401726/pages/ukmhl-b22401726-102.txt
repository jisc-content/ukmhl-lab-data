98 Morbid Anatomy.—Liver y fyc. K 8. A diseased Liver from a Person who died dropsi- cal. It was very much enlarged, not scliirrous but in a soft pulpy State, hardly bearing to be touched without tearing. The Duodenum and Omentum adhere to the lower Edge where there was an Abscess containing about two Ounces; these Adhesions are separated and hang down, shewing absorbent Glands much enlarged; the Coats of the Liver are very much thickened. The same Person as K 7. above. K 9. A Portion of a hard, cancerous Liver with cancer- ous Tubercles of different Sizes dispersed through its Substance. K 10. A scliirrous State of the Pori-biliarii of the Liver, from a Person with very schirrous and enlarged Uterus and Ovaria. K 11. A thickened and ulcerated Liver. K 12. A Portion of Liver, wherein most, if not all, the Pori-biliarii are obstructed and diseased ; the Surface and Substance throughout being stud- ded with schirrous Tubercles. This was a Disease of many Years’ Standing; occasioning Icteric Complaints at uncertain Intervals and of uncertain Duration: ending Life at last by Ascites and Anasai*ca, with their usual Conco- mitants.

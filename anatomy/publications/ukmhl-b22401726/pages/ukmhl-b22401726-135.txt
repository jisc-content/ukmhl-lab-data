The Mother about the fourth Month of Gestation was walking on the Ice, and was alarmed by feeling it crack under her. It is presumeable the Impression from Terror was transferred from her own Skin to that of the Foetus in Utero, leaving a permanent Dis- position to Contraction : for the Child was born covered with Cicatrices, the Skin having been universally torn and rent asunder. In various Situations the new Skin was pretty dense, in some Parts very thin and transparent, while in others it had not yet covered the Wounds. The Effect of this Process on the Forehead was the Retraction of the Palpebrse to that Degree, that the Eyes were staring wide as if without Eyelids. By Mr. H. K 2

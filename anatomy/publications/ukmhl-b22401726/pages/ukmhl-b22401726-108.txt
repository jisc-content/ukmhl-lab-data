The Cavities of the Kidney completely filled up with a soft Bird-lime Matter, almost pure Carbonate of Lime. The Weight of the Kid- ney was nearly a Pound. The corresponding Ureter was so wasted by Disease, that no trace whatever of it could be made out. The Kid- ney with its Contents was divided, then dried, and finally immersed in Spirits. The remain- ing Kidney in the same Subject was sound. Given me by Mr. H. M 39. The ulcerated Kidney of a Child, seven Years old. Many small Abscesses had formed from calcu- lous Irritation, one of these had burst through the peritonaeal Covering into the Cavity of the Abdomen, and a Pint and a half of Matter was found upon the Psoas Muscle upon Examina- tion of the Body. A Bougie is in the ulcera- ted Opening. The other Kidney was com- pletely diseased and suppurating. The Ure- ters on both Sides enlarged. See Bladder, N 45. From Mr. H.

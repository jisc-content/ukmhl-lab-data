T. J. 1797. A 14. An Aneurism at the Curve of the Aorta. A 15. A Portion of fibrous and lamelfated Coagulum from an Aneurism. A 16. An Aneurism of the Arch of the Aorta. The aneu- rismal Sac on its Surface has some yellow Spots of bony Matter. A 17. An Aneurism of the Aorta, shewing its diseased and ruptured Coats, as also its Contents; the Coagulum putting on its usual striated Appear- ance. A 18. A very large Aneurism of the Aorta Descendens, in the Thorax, laid open to shew Caries of the Vertebrae and Ribs, Portions of the Coagulum with the striated Appearance lying underneath. On the posterior Part, the Ribs are entirely destroyed and a Portion of the Coagulum pass- ing out. A 19. An Aneurism of the Thoracic Portion of the Aorta with the Coagulum which lay in the Cavities of the dissolved Bodies of the Vertebrae. A 20. The Aorta very much enlarged at its Curvature, and ossified. A 21. A large Aneurism of the Aorta-abdominalis. The Part of the Aorta where the Disease com- menced is very different from the Sac itself, being more in a State of Induration, and in some Parts quite ossified. A 22. The Iliac Arteries choked with coagulated Blood. A 23. An Aneurism of the Femoral Artery which burst and destroyed. There is a general tendency to Ossification; small Particles of Bone depo- sited.

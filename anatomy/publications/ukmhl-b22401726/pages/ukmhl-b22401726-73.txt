69 Human Monsters.—In Spirit. tricles communicate. The Aorta arises from nearly the Centre of this Opening, consequently from both Ventricles. A 21. A complete Transposition of the Thoracic and Ab- dominal Viscera in a Foetus. From Mr. 1802. A 22. A Child at the full Period, just in the State in which it was delivered; having no Covering to the Abdominal Viscera. The Case is attached to the Preparation. See also a Cast of this Pre- paration. (From Mr. .) A 2$. A Monstrous Child, brought into the World, 25th June, 1794. The Mother was a poor Woman at Evesham in Worcestershire; she was 33 Years of Age and had Six Children before. Nothing particular happened during her Preg- nancy with this. She had, of course, a very laborious time, but recovered perfectly. She felt the Child alive when taken in Labour, and it would probably have been born alive if she had had medical aid sooner. A Surgeon of Droitwich, near Evesham, bought it for Three Guineas, and sold it to a Person in this Town for 250 Guineas, of whom I bought it, 1797. See a Cast of this Monster to the right below. A 24. A double-bodied Human Monster, having only one Head. A 25. An Extra-uterine Foetus, which had grown to the Size of a Fifth or Sixth Months’ Pregnancy. The Tube and Ovarium are sound on the op- posite Side; and within the Uterus which is clearly thickened, we see evidently that some Process has been going on, like an Efflores- cence or Separation of an inner Coat from the Uterus. A 31. Note A 31. The Hydrocephalous Child, which stands near the same Place with the last Pre- paration, belongs to the Letter « A. Diseases ol the Head.”

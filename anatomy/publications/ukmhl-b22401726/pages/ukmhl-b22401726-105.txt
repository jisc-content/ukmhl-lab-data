A diseased Kidney, which formed a Tumor exter- nally in the Region of the Liver, and by some supposed to be Liver. The Tumor had been forming seven Weeks, and evidently contained a Fluid. It was the right Kidney of a young Woman, aged 24 Years, and was punctured by me, 1794. Five Pints of Foetid Matter by Measure were let out. She lived six Weeks. A hollow Bougie was kept in, and taken out twice a Day, when by Measure, half a Pint a Day for six Weeks, which is two Gallons and one Pint, add the five Pints at first, makes near three Gallons of Matter from the Kidney alone in the above Time. M 2. A Kidney, with a small Cavity in it from Disease.

423 POPLITEAL NERVES. POPLITEAL NERVES. These nerves and most of their branches have been illustrated in preceding Plates, but some of the muscular offsets of the internal nerve may be now observed more completely after the removal of the gastrocnemius.

The muscular branches of this nerve are furnished to the muscles of the calf and the popliteus. The nerves to the superficial muscle of the calf, viz., gastrocne- mius, have been before noticed (Plate liii.). The hranch to the plantaris muscle, 5, is an offset of the nerve to the outer head of the gastrocnemius ; it enters the fleshy fibres of its muscle with a small twig of an artery. The Iranch to the soleus, 6, descends beneath the gastrocne- mius, and divides into pieces which penetrate the muscle near the upper attachment to the bones of the leg, and at the super- ficial aspect. The branch to the 2^op)liteus, 9, arises opposite the knee-joint, and passes beneath the plantaris to the lower border of its muscle: at this point it jends round the edge of the popliteus, and enters the under surface. Loiver internal articular nerve, 7, which is shown at its origin in Plate lii., appears from beneath the popliteal vessels, and passes along the upper border of the popliteus muscle with the artery of the same name; it then runs beneath the internal lateral ligament to the fore part of the knee, where it pierces the capsule of the joint. External popliteal trunlc, 2. Nearly the same view of this nerve is given in this as in the preceding Plate. Inferiorly it passes beneath the peroneus longus, and divides between that

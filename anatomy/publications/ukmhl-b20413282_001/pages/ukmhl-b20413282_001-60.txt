396 DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. through the adductor magnus, and ends in the vastus externus ; it supplies offsets to the gluteus maximus and the long head of the biceps, and communicates by the branch, /, with the inter- nal circumflex. NERYES OF THE BUTTOCK. The chief nerves of the buttock appear below the pyriformis, and are derived from the sacral plexus ; but above the pyriformis comes the upper gluteal nerve ; and on the great sacro-sciatic ligament are sacral nerves. 1, 2, 3. Branches of the posterior sacral nerves. 4, 5, Branches of the superior gluteal nerve. 6. Branches of the small sciatic, cut. 7. Nerve to the upper gemellus. 8. Nerve to the quadratus femoris. 9. Nerve to the obturator internus. 10. Pudic nerve, 12. Great sciatic nerve: ft Cutaneous branches of the sacral nerves. Posterior sacral nerves, 1, 2, 3. These are the external branches of the posterior primary trunks of the first three sacral nerves; the highest is marked with number 1, and the lowest with 3. At first they are directed out beneath the multifidus spinjB muscle, and then unite, in the manner shown in the Figure, beneath a thin layer of fibres of the great sacro-sciatic ligament. From this plexiform union of the nerves two or three offsets are con- tinued through the gluteus maximus to the integuments of the buttock (Plate xlvii.). The nerves are not always joined in the manner indicated. TJioioer gluteal nerve. Springing from the large lumbo-sacral trunk which connects together the lumbar and sacral plexuses (p. 309), it issues from the pelvis above the pyriformis muscle with the gluteal artery. As soon as it comes into sight it divides, like the artery, into two pieces, which run forwards between the two smaller gluteal muscles. The upper or more superficial branch, 4, enters the gluteus medius ; and the deeper part, 5, furnishes offsets to both the gluteus medius and minimus, and ends anteriorly in the tensor fascige latse.

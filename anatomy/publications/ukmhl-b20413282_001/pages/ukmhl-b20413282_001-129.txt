ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 455 through the communicating part, o. From its extremity in the sole of the foot the large artery of the great toe is sent forwards, and one or two small branches run backwards. The large artery of the toe, n, (art. mag. pol.) is the digital branch of the anterior tibial, and supplies one toe and a half: it has the following arrangement. It runs forwards over the first interosseous muscle to the cleft of the toes, where it splits into the two collateral branches for the great toe and the next; and near the fore part of the interosseous space a branch is directed inwards under the flexor muscles, or between the heads of the short flexor, to form the digital branch, e, of the inner side of the great toe. The anterior tibial artery in the foot resembles the radial artery in the hand in supplying branches to one digit and a half But it diff"ers from that vessel in assisting to complete the plantar arch instead of forming, like the radial, a separate arch. Deep anastomosis of the foot. In the sole of the foot amongst the processes of the tendons and the ligaments is situate a chain of anastomoses between branches of the internal and external plantar with the dorsal artery of the foot, as is shown in the Drawing. External plantar nerve, 3. In this dissection of the nerve the branches to the interossei are traced out. From the part of the nerve by the side of the plantar arch small muscular offsets are supplied to all the interossei muscles : these are so evident as not to require figures of reference. The remaining muscular branches of this part of the nerve have been described with Fig. i.

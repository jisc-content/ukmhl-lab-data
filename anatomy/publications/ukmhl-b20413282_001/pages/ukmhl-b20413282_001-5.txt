341 THE FASCIA LATA. mit efferent vessels through the deep fascia to communicate with deeper lymphatics. Irritation of the surface of the foot, or of the inner part of the leg and thigh, along the course of the saphenous vein, may give rise to swelling and suppuration in this set of glands. Another group of superficial inguinal glands lies transversely along the line of Poupart's ligament. See Plate xxxii. Cutaneous nerves. The nerves now laid bare are derived from the lumbar plexus (p. 809); and they will be followed farther in the subsequent dissection of the thigh, with the exception of the ilio-inguinal. 1.

The ilio-inguinal nerve, 1, issues through the external abdominal ring, and terminates in offsets to the scrotum, and to the integu- ments of the thigh internal to, and rather below the saphenous opening. FASCIA LATA AND THE SAPHENOUS OPENING. The special fascia of the thigh, or the fascia lata, gives a sheath to the limb, and serves for the attachment, of muscular fibres at certain points : it is pierced also by apertures for vessels and nerves.

Opaque line of the blood- The fascia lata C forms a continuous tube around the thigh, and sends inward processes to form sheaths for the muscles. White lines on the surface indicate the position of the intermus- cular septa. Along the front of the thigh is a wider yellowish line, 1, which marks the situation of the subjacent femoral vessels.

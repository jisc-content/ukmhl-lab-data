GLUTEUS MEDIUS MUSCLE, 3S3 and nerves. On the fore part of the g-luteus medius the fascia lata has been left. MUSCLES OF THE BUTTOCK. Two groups of muscles occupy the back of the pelvis, viz. the glutei or abductors of the hip, and the external rotators of the sajne joints A. Glntexis maximns, cut. B. Gluteus medius. C. Pyriformia. LÂ». Gluteus minimus. E. Gemellus sxiperior. F. Obturator intemus. G. Gemellus inferior. H. Obturator esternus. L Quadratna femoris. J. Adductor magnus. L. Semitendinosus. JJ". Biceps cruris. 0. Semimembranoaus. P. Vastus externus. Q. Tensor vaginje femoris. E. Great aacro-sciatic ligament. S. Fascia lata on the gluteus. The ghdeiis medius, B, is placed farther forwards than the glu- teus maximus, and the fibres converge to the top of the trochanter. It arises from the outer surface of the os innominatum between the crest and the upper curved line, except behind where the glu- teus maximus is attached, extending nearly to the hinder border of the bone ; and the superficial fibres are attached to the fascia lata. The muscle is inserted below across the outer surface of the great trochanter from the tip to the root. The muscle is in part subcutaneous, and is in part covered by the gluteus maximas. Its anterior border touches the tensor fasciae latae, Q ; and the hinder border, which is contiguous to the pyriformis, near the pelvis, overlays this muscle near the femur. Between it and the pyriformis are seen the superficial part of the gluteal artery, and the superior gluteal nerve. The action of the muscle will vary with the state of the bones as to fixedness or mobility. Should the femm* be fi-ee to be moved the muscle will abduct it from its fellow. If the bone is hanging the anterior and lower fibres will rotate it inwards. In the beginuing of a step in walk- ing the fore part of the muscle acts with the smallest gluteus in bringing forwards the hinder limb until it comes into a line with the tnmk.

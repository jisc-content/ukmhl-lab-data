DISSECTION OF THE FRONT OF THE LEG. 450 DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LVIII. The dissection of the front of the leg and dorsum of the foot appears in this Illustration. In preparing the dissection divide the skin along the centre of the limb, and reflect it to the sides by means of a cross cut at each end, and a third opposite the ankle. After search has been made for the cutaneous nerves and vessels in the fat, the fascia may be taken away to show the muscles and the deeper vessels and nerves ; but in executing this step the two parts of the anterior annular ligament are to be defined and left, as in the Plate. CUTANEOUS VEINS AND ARTERIES. On the dorsum of the foot is the arch in which the saphenous veins begin. The small arteries ramifying on the surface of the le": and foot are derived from the anterior tibial trunk. a. Venous arch, of the foot. b. Internal saphenous. c. External saphenous. d. Communicating veins. p. Vense comites. The venous arch, a, on the doi'sura of the foot, answers to a similar arch on the back of the hand. Contained in the sub' cutaneous fat, it is placed anterior to the tarsus. Its convexity is turned towards the toes, and is joined by small digital veins ; and at its concavity open small superficial, with some deep veins, d. At each end the arch is continued into a saphenous vein. The internal saphenous vein, h, begins at the inner end of the dorsal arch, and ascending to the leg in front of the inner ankle crosses obliquely the tibia: its farther course in the leg behind that bone is manifest in Plate LV, The external saphenous vein, c, springs from the confluence of

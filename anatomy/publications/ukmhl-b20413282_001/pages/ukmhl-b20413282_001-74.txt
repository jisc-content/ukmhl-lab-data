410 DISSECTIOX OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. Branches of this part of the artery. These consist of muscular and articular, as before said. Upper muscular branches. Three or four in number they spring from the popliteal trunk soon after it enters the ham : they supply the semimembranosus and biceps, but most enter the former muscle; and in those muscles they communicate with the per- forating and muscular branches of the profunda. The articular arteries ramify over, and in the knee-joint. They are five in number, yiz. an upper and a lower pair, with a single central branch, but only the upper pair comes into this dissection. The upper pair of articular branches leave the sides of the parent trunk, and are directed over the femur to the front of the limb. The external, Tc, passes beneath the biceps, and the internal, 1, beneath the adductor magnus and the other muscles bounding internally the ham; on the fore part of the knee they end in muscular branches to the triceps, and in anastomotic branches over the joint. The middle or azygos artery penetrates into the joint through the posterior ligament ; it is concealed by the large popliteal nerve. The popliteal vein, o, has the same extent, and the same con- nections with surrounding parts as the artery, but its position to that vessel changes. Between the heads of the gastrocnemius it conceals entirely the artery, but higher up the artery becomes more and more uncovered, and at the opening in the adductor magnus the vein is quite external. Its contributing branches are muscular and articular, corre- sponding with those of the artery; and it receives in addition the short saphenous vein, p, opposite the back of the joint. NERVES OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. The great sciatic nerve and its two primary popliteal branches are continued along the back of the thigh to the leg. At the buttock the ramifications of the small sciatic nerve come into sight.

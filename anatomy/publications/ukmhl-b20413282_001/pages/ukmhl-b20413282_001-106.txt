DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. through near the heel, aud is to be removed in part, as is here shovrn. Then the dissection will be completed after the removal of the fat and fascia. SECOXD LAYEE OF MUSCLES. In this group are included the flexors of the digits which take origin at the back of the leg, viz. flexor longns pollicis, and flexor longns digitorum with its accessory muscles. The same letters in the two Figures mark the same parts. T\ Flexor longus digitonun. E. Flexor longus poUicis. F. Flexor accessoiius. G. Inner h.ead of accessorius. H. Liim'bricales. I. Tendon of flexor "breris digito- rum. J. Tendon of flexor longns digito- rum. L. Sheath of flexor tendons, i!^. Flexor brevis pollicis. 0. Flexor minim digiti. P. Interossei. Q. Tendon of peroneus longus. Tendon of flexor longus pollicis, E. Issuing at the back of the foot from a groove in the astragalus and os calcis, where it is enveloped by a synovial membrane, it is directed inwards to the root of the great toe ; it then enters the digital sheath, where it is incased in a second synovial sac, and is inserted into the base of the ungual phalanx. In the foot it rests on the flexor brevis pollicis, X, and lies under the tendon of the flexor longus digitorum, D : to this last tendon it i.> connected by a slip, which is prolonged most com- monly into those pieces of the common flexor of the digits belonging to the second and third toes, and in greatest proportion to the inner one (Turner).* Tendon of flexor longus digiformn, D. This tendon appears on the inner part of the foot; it is then inclined towards the middle of the sole, and divides into four pieces for the four outer toes. Each of these pieces, J, enters the digital sheath with a tendon, I, of the short flexor, and having pierced that tendon is inserted into the base of the last phalanx. * On Tariahility iu Human Structure, by ^Villiam Turner, M.B. ; Trans, of Rr.yal Soc. of Edinb., vol. xxiv.

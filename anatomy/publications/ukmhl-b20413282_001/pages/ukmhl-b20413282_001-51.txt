ARTERIES OF THE BUTTOCK. 387 nosus, L, biceps, N, and semimembranosus, 0, and they are more fully seen in Plate Lii. Parts of the origin and insertion of the adductor magnus, which were not visible in the former view of the muscle (Plate xlvii.), are now denuded. Internal to the hamstrings may be seen the origin from the ischial tuberosity ; and external to those muscles is the wide expanded part, which is inserted into the femur in a line with the quadratus femoris, and in the attachment side of the gluteus maximus. ARTERIES OF THE BUTTOCK. Most of the arteries of the buttock belong to the set of external parietal branches of the internal iliac (p. 306): they are the gluteal, sciatic, and pudic, which issue from the pelvis by the great sacro-sciatic notch. Branches of the profunda artery appear also in the lower part of the region dissected. a. Superficial part of the gluteal artery. h. Pudic artery. c. Trunk of the sciatic. d. Coccygeal branch of the sciatic. e. Muscular and anastomotic branch of the sciatic. /. Continuation of the sciatic. g. Branch to great sciatic nerve. h. Branch of internal circumflex. i. Ending of first perforating ar- tery. The gluteal artery comes through the great sacro-sciatic notch above the pyriformis, and supplies the gluteal muscles. It divides at once into a superficial and a deep piece, and the latter of these will be contained in the next Plate. The superficial part a, sends off many branches to the under surface of the gluteus maximus. One or two small branches run inwards and backwards through the great sacro-sciatic ligament to the integuments, and send deeper off^sets to the muscle over the back of the sacrum. The pudic artery^ h, appears in the buttock for a very short dis- tance : it leaves the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic notch, below the pyriformis, and then winds over the ischial spine by the side of the nerve of the same name, to enter the perina3uni through the small sacro-sciatic notch, c c 2

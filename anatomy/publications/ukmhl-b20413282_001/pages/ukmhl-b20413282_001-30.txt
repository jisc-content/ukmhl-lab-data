DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLVI. This Illustration shows the dissection of the deep muscles of the fore and outer parts of the thigh, with their vessels and nerves. The thigh having been prepared for the drawing of the pre- ceding Fgure, the dissection for this Plate will be completed by cutting through the rectus muscle, and removing the fat from the branches of the external circumflex artery and anterior crural nerve. With the handle of the scalpel the outer vastus, L, may be separated above from the inner vastus, F, where vessels and nerves intervene ; and the thin aponeurosis, 0, which is con- tinued from their common tendon over the knee-joint, may be cut through and raised to the sides of the knee. All the fascia lata on the outer part of the thigh is to be removed, except a narrow slip with the insertion of the tensor vaginse femoris. MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. The chief fleshy mass on the front of the femur is formed by the three parts or heads of the extensor of the knee-joint ; but at the upper and outer parts of the thigh are the small tensor vagina femoris, and the gluteal muscles. A. Sartorius, cut. B. Gluteus medius. C. Tensor vaginje femoris. D. Hiacus. E. Kectus femoris, cut. F. Vastus internus. G. Pectineus. H. Adductor longus. K.- Adductor brevis. L. Vastus externus. M. Gluteus minimus. N. Ligaraeutum patellte. 0. Expansion from the extensor tendon of the knee. P. IFendon of the extensor cruris. The tensor vagiim femoris, C, is a small muscle, which is

DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLV. The anatomy of the femoral vessels and anterior crural nerve may be acquired from this Figure. After the completion of the dissection for the preceding Plate the chief nerve and vessels on the front of the thigh will be brought into view by removing the cutaneous nerves, and by- taking away the greater part of the sartorius muscle. On the removal of the fat and an aponeurosis beneath the sartorius the nerve and vessels will be visible. SURFACE MUSCLES OF THE FRONT OF THE THIGH. The connections of the several superficial muscles can be per- ceived in this Figure ; but the description of each will be given subsequently with the group of muscles to which it belongs : they are marked by the same letters of reference as in Plate XLIV. A. Ends of the sartorius. B. Gluteus maximus. C. Tensor vaginae femoris. D. Hiacus. E. Rectus femoris. F. Vastus internus. G. Pectineus. H. Adductor longus. I. Gracilis. J. Adductor magnus. K. Semi-membrauosus. FEMORAL ARTERY AND VEIN. The main blood vessels of the lower limb, like those of the upper, are large single trunks as far as one bone reaches in the member, and divide into branches in the leg where two bones are present.

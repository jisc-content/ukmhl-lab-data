355 SCARPA-'S TRIANGULAR SPACE. to the abdomen, is limited by Poupart's ligament: in the dissected limb this band forms a straight line, but before the removal of the fascia it arches down below the level of the arteries, & and c., and diminishes the length of the space. The apex is formed by the meeting of the sartorius, A, and adductor longus, H, and points to the inner side of the mid-line of the thigh. Towards the surface this space is closed by the strong fascia lata, and by the teguments and the inguinal glands : this covering will vary in thickness according to the quantity of fat in the body. The floor or the deep boundary is limited by the iliacus, 7^^^^^ D, and psoas, at the outer part; and at the inner part, by the pectineus, G, adductor longus, H, and still nearer the femoral vessels by a small piece of the adductor brevis. The hollow is deepest near the middle, where the blood vessels lie, and gradually becomes shallower from that point towards each side. It contains the femoral artery and vein, with their first branches, the anterior crural nerve, and lymphatics and fat. The femoral artery, Â«, lies along the centre or deepest part of '/J -"^^-^^^ the intermuscular interval, resting above on the psoas muscle, and furnishing the large profunda and small superficial branches: it leaves the space below by sinking under the sartorius, about an inch outside the apex. The femoral vein, m, lies close to, and on the inner side of the (//) /^t^ ^^^^ artery, gradually winding beneath that vessel near the sartorius muscle. Like the artery it is most superficial at Poupart's ligament; and at that spot it rests on the pubes, between the pectineus and psoas muscles. In the space it is joined by the saphenous or superficial, and by deep veins. The anterior crural nerve, 4, enters the space on the outer side(//^y/i^W^ of the artery, and may lie close to that vessel, as in the Plate, or J\<-ty<^ . at a short distance from it (quarter to half an inch). Above it lies deeply between the iliacus and psoas, and is separated from the artery by a slip of muscular fibres. About two inches from Poupart's ligament it breaks up into superficial and muscular branches ; but before this final division it sends one or two small branches beneath the femoral vessels to the pectineus muscle. Deep lymphatics lie around the femoral vessels, and receive

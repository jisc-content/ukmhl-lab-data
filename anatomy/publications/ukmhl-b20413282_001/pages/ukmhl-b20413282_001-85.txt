Thene muscles raise the 05 calcis, and in this way extend the ankle. Should the toes rest on the ground, so as to render the fVx>t immoveable, the mnscles can still raise the heel with the weight of the bodr, a« in the different kinds of progression, or in standincr on the to€«. If the lower attachment becomes the fixed point the Bolens can render the leg-bones steady on the foot, and the o-astro- cnemius and plantaris will support the knee-joint, as in the straightened state of the liml) in standing. Ilurincr stooping to the ground the gastrocnemius and ijlantaris will assist in bendinjr the knee ; and in the act of rising from that posture the soleus brings back the bones of the leg over the astragalus. Before the foot reach^ the ground in walking backwards the miLscles point the toes; and after the sole tonch^ the ground they incline back the slanting limb orer it.

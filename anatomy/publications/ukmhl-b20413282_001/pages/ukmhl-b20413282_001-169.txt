PEEFACE. This Volume contains a concise description of a series of Anatomical Plates in folio in a separate Atlas, with some remarks on the practical applications of Anatomical facts to Surgery. The purpose for which the Plates are designed, and the circumstances connected with their production are explained below. With the view of carrying out the pictorial representa- tion of dissections, the part of the Human Body to be illus- trated is divided into suitable stages or regions; and the muscles, blood-vessels, and nerves of each region are shown in layers in the natural order of succession, so that their mutual connections may be brought before the eye at one and the same time. The Illustrations comprise views of the Head and Neck, the upper Limb, the Perinseum, the Abdominal parietes, the Pelvis, and the lower Limb. All the Figures are drawn of life- size from actual dissections ; and they are printed in colours with the object of making them as true pictures as possible of Nature, and more serviceable as copies for the Student to imitate. Only such dissections were prepared for the Drawings as may be commonly seen in the practical Anatomy Koom; and the minute detail, whose counterpart the Student with average manual dexterity could not pro- duce without some difficulty and loss of time, was inten- tionally omitted.

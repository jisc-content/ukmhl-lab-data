450 DISSECTION OF THE SOLE OF THE FOOT. MUSCLES OF THE FOURTH LAYER. In the last layer of the sole of the foot are included the inter ossei, and the tendons of insertion of the tibialis posticus anc peroneus longus. When the same letters are used in the Figure; they point to the same parts. Prolongations of the tendon of the tibialis posticus at its insertion. X. Three plantar interossei. Z. Four dorsal interossei. The mterossei muscles are seven in number, and fill the interval between the metatarsal bones. Two are lodged in each inte: metatarsal space, except in the inner where there is only one and they are attached to the bones bounding laterally the spaces they are arranged into a plantar and a dorsal set. The plantar set, X, three in number, are slender fleshy slip which lie in the three outer spaces, and arise each from a sing metatarsal bone, viz., fifth, fourth, and third. Opposite the met|, ^ tarso-phalangeal joint each becomes tendinous, and is insertel li into the inner side of the base of the first phalanx of its toe; I i slip is prolonged from it to join the extensor tendons on tjl ii dorsum of the phalanx. i k The dorsal set, Z, are four in number, one being placed in eaA id of the intermetatarsal spaces. Each has a double origin lateraF < from the two metatarsal bones between which it is lodged. A;- teriorly they end in tendons, which are inserted, like the planij^ muscles, into the fibular side of the fourth and third toes, and ir) both sides of the second toe: they join also the extensor tendos on the dorsum. All the muscles are visible in the sole of the foot, where thj are covered by fascia, by the external plantar nerve, and tl plantar arch and its branches : near the toes the transversfs pedis and the transverse metatarsal ligament lie on them, m the dorsum of the foot only the dorsal set appear ; and they \n pierced behind by arteries passing from the one aspect of the f ji to the other.

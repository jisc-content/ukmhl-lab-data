A SURFACE view of the muscles of the fore and inner parts of the thigh, with the cutaneous nerves placed in position after being dissected. The common mode of proceeding with the dissection of the thigh has been here departed from, with the view of keeping within bounds the number of the Plates. Usually the subcuta- neous nerves and vessels contained in the fat are first traced out. Scarpa's space at the top of the thigh is next laid bare, and the fascia lata is then removed to bring into view the muscles. If it is wished to study Scarpa's space separately from the rest, let the lower two thirds of the Plate be covered with a piece of paper. The cutaneous nerves of the front of the thigh are either direct offsets of the lumbar plexus, or are derived from branches of that plexus. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE XLIV.

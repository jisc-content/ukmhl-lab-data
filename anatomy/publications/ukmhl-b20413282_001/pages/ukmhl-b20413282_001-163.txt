By GEORGE VINER ELLIS, PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY IN UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, LONDON. The author has made the work a system of dissections of the whole body in parts or regions, in order that the knowledge obtained by its use may be prac- tical rather than verbal. For the purpose of carrying out the plan proposed, he has divided the book into chapters and sections, and has included in each the dissection of one great division of the body, such as a limb, the thorax, the abdomen, the head and neck, etc., etc. The dissection of each part is conducted by those steps foimd best adapted, after many years' experience in teaching, for the purpose of making a complete examination of all the structures of each particular region. Thus, beginning at the surface, attention is first directed to superficial marks as indices of the subjacent bone, vessels, or muscles ; next, the soft parts are observed in succession, with their natural position undisturbed ; and lastly, the individual joints are brought under the notice of the dissector. To enable the student to make progress without the constant superintendence of an instructor, full directions for the performance of the several manual proceedings are given, and the different objects that come into view on the removal of the more superficial layers are severally distinguished. The anatomical description has been made topographical, so to say, in ac- cordance with the peculiar plan of the work ; for only so much of a vessel, nerve, or muscle, is described, as may be laid bare by the dissection, in order that the student may not be perplexed by a reference to objects which are not seen.

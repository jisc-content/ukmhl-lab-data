398 DISSECTION OF THE POPLITEAL SPACE. FORM, SIZE, AND BOUNDARIES. The ham is placed at the back of the knee-joint, and corresponds with the interval in front of the elbow in the upper limb. Like the intermuscular space which it resembles, it is situate on that aspect of the joint to which flexion takes place, and lodges the main vessels and nerves of the limb. A. Biceps cruris. E. Sartorius. B. Semimembranosus. F. Plantaris. C. Semitendinosus. G. Outer head ) of the gastro- D. Gracilis. H. Inner head) cnemius. In form the popliteal space is lozenge-shaped, with the points directed up and down. Before its lateral boundaries are dis- turbed it extends about two inches and a half above the knee- joint, and downwards about one inch and a half from the same point ; but its length will vary with the degree of separation of the hamstring muscles. This hollow is produced by the arrangement of the muscles at the knee, for the hamstrings and the heads of the gastrocnemius and the plantaris, as they pass the joint, are collected on the sides of the limb, and give rise thus to the angular interval of the popliteal space. By the removal of the muscles from the mid- line of the limb to the side, greater extent of bending is per- mitted in the joint. Towards the surface the ham is closed by the teguments, and by the fascia lata strengthened by transverse fibres from the tendons of the hamstrings. And the bottom of the space is formed by the femur and the knee-joint. Laterally it is inclosed by the intermuscular septa, which are inserted into the condyloid lines of the femur, and by the following muscles. On the outer side lies the biceps muscle. A, as low as the condyle of the femur; and below that point come the plantaris, F, and outer head of the gastrocnemius, G. On the I inner side it is limited as low as the condyle by the semimembra- nosus, B ; by the semitendinosus, C, lying on the other ; and by j the sartorius and gracilis, D and E, which intervene between the |

DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. 418 fleshy fibres to the condyloid line for about an inch. And the outer belly is fixed also by tendon to the outer condyle of the femur, viz. to the upper and hinder part, but chiefly to an im- pression on the outer surface. Fleshy fibres soon succeed to each tendon of attachment, and descend, forming separate bellies (inner and outer), to end in the wide common tendon. The common tendon, broad and thin above, where it receives ' the gastrocnemius, becomes narrower below, and joins that of the soleus in the tendo Achillis, K : from it a slender piece is pro- longed upwards between the halves of the muscle. The muscle is in contact by one surface with the fascia of the leg ; and by the other with the soleus and plantaris, and the popliteal vessels and the internal popliteal nerve. The inner half I or belly is more prominent than the outer, and reaches lower down the leg. At its origin the two parts of the muscle limit laterally the popliteal space. In extension of the ankle the muscle is always combined with the soleus through the tendo Achillis ; but from its attachment to the femur it possesses a power of moving that bone, which is not shared by the soleus. Supposing the foot fixed, the gas- trocnemius can draw back and down the femur, bending the knee- joint at the same time, as is exemplified in stooping to the ground, or in squatting. In walking backwards it will assist \ the soleus, the knee-joint being kept straight by the extensors, in bringing the limb over the projected foot. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE LIV. The soleus and plantaris muscles, and the lower part of the popliteal vessels and nerves, are laid bare in this view. On cutting through the heads of the gastrocnemius opposite] the knee-joint, and removing that muscle as far as the commonj

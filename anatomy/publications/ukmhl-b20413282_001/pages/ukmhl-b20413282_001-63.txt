VESSELS OF THE HAM. 399 semimembranosus and the femur ; and below, the condyle is situate the inner head of the gastrocnemius, H. The upper and lower points or angles are constructed also by muscles. At the upper, the biceps, A, and semitendinosus, C, are in contact; and at the lower, the inner head of the gas- trocnemius, H, comes into apposition with the plantaris and the outer head of the gastrocnemius, F and G. The depth of the space is greater above, than below the knee- joint, and is greatest opposite the inter-condyloid hollow of the femur. The widest part is on a level with the condyles of the femur. The ham is closed on all sides except above and below, and at those spots it communicates with the back of the thigh and leg. Above, a probe can be pushed under the hamstrings along the course of the internal popliteal nerve; and below% it can be passed under the gastrocnemius by the side of the great blood-vesself. Blood poured out from the vessels into the hollow would diffuse itself under the muscles of the thigh and leg in the channels indicated. In the popliteal space are contained the large blood-vessels and nerves of the limb, with their branches; a branch of the obturator nerve ; an offset of the small sciatic nerve with its artery ; and lymphatics, with much fat. VESSELS OF THE HAM. The chief vessels in the ham are the popliteal artery and vein, which wind from the fore part to the back of the limb above the knee, so as to pass the knee-joint on the flexion-side ; but branches of those trunks cross the space, and a small superficial artery, accompanying the small sciatic nerve, is continued through it to the leg. Popliteal artery. Upper external articular. Upper internal articular. Cutaneous branches with veins. Cutaneous branch with the small sciatic. Cutaneous branch of the anasto- motic. Internal sural to gastrocnemius. Short saphenous vein. Cutaneous veins of the back of the leg. Popliteal vein. External sural artery to the a;astrocnemius.

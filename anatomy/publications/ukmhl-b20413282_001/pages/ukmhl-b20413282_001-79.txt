SUPERFICIAL VESSELS OF THE LEG. 4If! external popliteal nerve: appearing superficial to the fascia, it joins the short saphenous as soon as this becomes cutaneous. To the outer side of the leg it furnishes a considerable cutaneous branch, 6, which reaches two thirds or more of the distance to the heel: this branch may arise separately from the external popliteal trunk. One or two other cutaneous nerves for the upper and outer part of the leg are supplied by the external popliteal nerve. SUPERFICIAL VESSELS OF THE BACK OF THE LEG. Both cutaneous arteries and veins are found with the cutaneous nerves at the back of the les;. Arteries. a. Trunk of the popliteal. 5. Muscular branch of popliteal. c. Cutaneous branch with short saphenous nerve. d. Cutaneous branch with peroneal fimnmrniip-ariHg nerve. e. Cutaneous part of the anasto- motic artery. Veins, Trunk of the popliteal. Internal or long saphenous. External or short saphenous. Communicating branch between saphenous veins. Communicating to saphenous from posterior tibial. ' Cutaneous arteries. Many of these perforate the deep fascia at intervals, and some pierce the gastrocnemius ; but the longest and argest accompany the superficial veins. The Iranch, c, with the short saphenous nerve springs from the Dopliteal trunk near the knee-joint, and accompanies the vein Deneath the fascia to reach the integuments. The Iranch, with the peroneal Gomnmmcating nerve, begins in muscular branch of the popUteal trunk, and runs with an offset )f the nerve to the integuments of the outer part of the calf. A h'anch with the small sciatic nerve is supplied from the mus- ular artery, h, and reaches the integuments below the upper hird of the leg. The cutaneous branch, e, of the anastamotic appears at the knee ; escapes from beneath the sartorius, and is continued onwards ith the internal saphenous nerve.

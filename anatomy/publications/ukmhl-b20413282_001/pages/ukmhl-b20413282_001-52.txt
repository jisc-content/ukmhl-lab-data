388 DISSECTION OF THE BUTTOCK. The sciatic artery, c, escapes with the pudic and sciatic vessels and nerves through the great sacro-sciatic notch, and is accom- panied by cutaneous offsets of the small sciatic nerve. It supplies the part of the buttock below the gluteal artery, and furnishes the following branches :— The coccygeal Iranch, d, pierces the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and supplies the gluteus maximus : one of its branches enters that muscle, and accompanies the chief cutaneous offset of the sacral nerves ; whilst others ramify on the back of the sacrum and coccyx. Muscular and anastomotic Iranch, e. This artery varies much in size, and passes transversely outwards to the root of the great trochanter. It supplies largely the gluteus maximus, and ends at the spot mentioned by anastomosing with the gluteal and in- ternal circumflex arteries. ■ Nerve Iranches. A small artery, g, enters the trunk of the great sciatic nerve, and is called " comes nervi ischiadici." And the continuation of the artery,/, accompanies the smaller sciatic nerve, branching like it to be distributed with the several offsets of the nerve. Muscular branches, many of which were cut in the dissection, enter the under surface of the great gluteus, and the lower external rotator muscles ; and the artery to the quadratus femoris runs to its muscle with the nerve, 5 beneath the gemelli and in- ternal obturator. The internal circumflex artery of the profunda (Plate L.) divides into two beneath the quadratus : the branch, h, to the thigh issues between the contiguous borders of the quadratus and adductor maguus, and is distributed to the hamstrings. First perforating artery. This branch of the profunda pierces the adductor magnus, and supplying the gluteus maximus and the biceps muscle, N, ends in the vastus externus. NERVES OF THE BUTTOCK. Most of the nerves included in this dissection are branches of the sacral plexus, and appear at the lower border of the pyri-

343 THE SAPHENOUS OPENING. pierced by "many small apertures for lymphatics and vessels, it has been named the cribriform fascia. Through this large aperture pass the saphenous vein, lym- phatics, and one or more small superficial vessels : the vein enters nearer the lower than the upper cornu, but the others have not a fixed position. By means of this aperture a femoral hernia comes forwards, and forms a swelling in the thigh ; and as the saphenous opening serves as the aperture of exit of the hernia from beneath the fascia, it answers to the external abdominal ring of the inguinal hernia. The intestine escapes through the upper part of the opening above the situation of the vein, and pushes before it, while pro- truding, the crural sheath in which it descends, and the thin cribriform fascia placed over that hole. As the hernial tumour enlarges it is directed upwards upon the firm outer margin of the openingâ€”the part above E ; and since the gut makes a sharp curve round the fascia it may be constricted at that spot by the thickened falciform process. The condition of the margins of the aperture as to tightness and looseness depends upon the position of the limb, and on the tension of the rest of the fascia lata. When the thigh is bent and rotated in, the margins of the saphenous opening are rendered- lax ; but if the thigh is extended and rotated out, the aperture is made tighter and smaller, and the outer edge takes on the characters of a firm constricting band. In an attempt therefore to force backwards a piece of protruded intestine into the abdomen the position of the limb should be specially attended to, for success may depend upon the greatest possible laxity being given to the edges of the saphenous opening.

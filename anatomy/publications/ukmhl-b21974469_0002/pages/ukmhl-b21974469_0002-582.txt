542 of disease in the thorax rather than in the pericar- dium, because he had been accustomed to observe that a troublesome sensation was experienced in that part from the crura diaphragmatis being irri- tated or compressed.—41. From some of the cases of thoracic inflammation which have been narrated, and from others which are on record, it is evident, that dropsy of the pericardium, as well as of the thorax, sometimes takes place suddenly, though at other times these accumulations of fluid are gradual.—42. Dropsy of the pericardium is by no means a rare occurrence when conjoined with other diseases of the thorax, but I do not recollect to have met with it alone; and the circumstance of its seldom existing without complication with other affections, occasions a difficulty in determining upon the symptoms which are peculiar to accumulations of fluid in this capsule. Cases, therefore, in which it has been discovered uncomplicated, merit parti- cular attention; and the following is an instance of this nature.—Morgagni, xvi. 20. Case 17. Hydrops pericardii. A man whose feet had long been cedematous was seized with slight fever. His respiration became increasingly difficult every day, so that he was constrained to breathe with the neck upright. He had cough and mucous expectoration, with great thirst. At length he died. Dissection. When the body was dissected, the pericardium was found to be full of serum. Valsalva, xvi. 21.

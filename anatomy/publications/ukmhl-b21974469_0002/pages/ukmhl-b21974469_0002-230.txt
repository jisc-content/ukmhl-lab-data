190 the diaphragm from this intercourse, but even between the nostrils and the abdominal viscera. The sympathetic relation which subsists between the Schneiderian membrane and the abdominal viscera, I observed in a nobleman by whom I was consulted some years ago. He was subject to attacks of an epileptic nature, which appeared to commence from the hypochondria, but were pre- ceded by a fetid odour, very annoying to himself, though none of the by-standers could perceive it even when they purposely inhaled his breath. It appeared to me that the irritation in the hypochon- dria was propagated through the intercostal nerves, and by the small nerve we have just mentioned, to the nostrils, and excited an action in the olfactory nerves similar to that occasioned by the effluvia exhaled from a fetid substance.* Morgagni, xiv. 28. * So generally does the Schneiderian membrane become the seat of sympathetic irritation, from intestinal worms, that itching in the nostrils is recognised as one of the diagnostic signs of their existence. But this does not arise from any peculiarity of ex citement, for a similar effect is often produced when the alimen- tary canal is subjected to continued unnatural stimulation from other causes. Whether the stomach and intestines be infested with worms, pervaded by morbid secretions, stimulated by undi- gested aliment, or disturbed in their functions by any other causes, the mucous surface of the nasal cavities is very frequently implicated: there is turgidity of its vessels with itching, sneezing, or repeated hemorrhage—superficial ulceration—enlargement of the mucous glands—or thickening in the other textures of the nose. Certainly these affections, and the fleshy excrescence which constitutes the common nasal polypus, may arise from topical disease, or from some local injury; but I believe they are usually derived from the source to which I have adverted.

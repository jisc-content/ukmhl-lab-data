471 Dissection. The tumour, which during life had been hard, was now flaccid, and was found to be filled with blood, part of which was grumous and the remainder fluid. The adjacent glands were greatly indurated, and compressed the oesophagus and jugular vein ; and the parietes, both of the vein and of the gullet, were thickened. The larger trunk of this vein and the aorta were lacerated. The surface of the lungs was diversified with black spots, and in the texture of these organs some globules of calcareous matter, and a large quantity of serous fluid, were discovered. Valsalva, xvii. 19. Valsalva has not been sufficiently explicit in this case, but when I considered the protracted diffi- culty of respiration, especially after violent motion, I regarded it as an instance of aneurism of the aorta. The period of his admission into the hos- pital, when the tumour was particularly noticed, accounted for pulsation not being observed. The aorta by dilating upwards was, I believe, the occasion of most of the symptoms which had been noticed—the pressure upon the trachea and larynx would tend to impair the voice—and the compression of the pharynx and oesophagus rendered deglutition, at first, difficult, and as the disease advanced, totally obstructed the canal. The internal jugular vein being submitted to com- pression, the return of blood from the head was interrupted; and from this circumstance the pain of the head, the redness of the countenance, and the wandering of intellect arose.— Morgagni, 20.

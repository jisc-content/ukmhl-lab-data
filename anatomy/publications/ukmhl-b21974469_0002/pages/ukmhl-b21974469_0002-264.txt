224 substance to within a finger’s breadth of the cor- responding lateral ventricle.— Valsalva, li. 57. Numerous cases are registered in medical works, in which the patient survived an injury of the brain, occasioned by a wound through the orbit, for nine, twelve, fourteen, and even twenty-one days: but I have met with no instance in which there was a more complete exemption from in- convenience than in this. In some of the other cases alluded to the animal functions indeed ap- pear to have been but slightly disturbed till near the period of decease. The upper part of the orbit is so extremely thin, that wounds inflicted with a pointed instrument in that direction are not to be lightly regarded, espe- cially if there should be a supervention of sleepiness, nausea, fever, vertigo, or any sign of paralysis. But injuries of this nature have not invariably proved fatal, for even where amaurosis of the cor- responding eye, and paralysis of the opposite side have resulted, the patient has been known to survive. In a case related by Nebelius there was paralysis and aphonia, but the patient regained perfect health in about six weeks.*—Morgagni, 58. * It is sometimes astonishing how much injury the brain will support. Splinters of bone have been thrust into it, and frag- ments of its substance have come away; and though paralysis and convulsions ensued, yet the patient has ultimately recovered. In cases of hernia cerebri large portions have been sliced oft' without being destructive to life. If such cases are inexplicable, they afford striking and encouraging evidence that the brain possesses considerable power of sustaining and repairing its or- ganic lesions.—Ed,

433 arch, seemed to be broader than usual. Its internal coat was marked here and there with white spots, and was unequal; and, what seemed to me more important, it was of a reddish black colour, as if it had been affected with inflammation. The appear- ance of opaque spots did not extend farther than the dilated part of the artery; but the other morbid changes were evinced beyond the arch, where the artery descends upon the vertebrae, though not in so great a degree as in the expanded por- tion. They were continued into the arteria inno- minata. The vessels of the pia mater were turgid with blood ; and the lateral ventricles were occupied by a somewhat bloody serum. The abdomen was not opened.—Morgagni, xxvi. 35. In numerous cases of sudden death which have been observed by my friends, no morbid appear- ances have been discovered except disease in the aorta.*—36. # An increased redness is often observed within the aorta, but distinct inflammation has seldom been noticed. Mr. Hodgson has related a case which was communicated to him by Dr. Farre in which there had been effusion of lymph. It was intimately connected with the inner coat of the aorta, and a plug of it had extended into the left subclavian artery, and nearly obliterated the cavity of that vessel. The man had been attacked with violent pneumonia. In a young man who had committed suicide by taking a large quantity of arsenic, and who died about ten or twelve hours afterwards, I found, amongst other morbid appear- ances, a deep redness to the extent of a three-shilling piece within the right ventricle; and, at the root of the aorta, there was a, corresponding appearance as to colour, and some small F f

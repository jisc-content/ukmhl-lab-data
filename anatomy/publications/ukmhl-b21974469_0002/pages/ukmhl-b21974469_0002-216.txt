There was much greenish water in the lateral ventricles; and to the bottom of the right ventricle pus of a similar colour had subsided. A much larger quantity of purulent matter was discovered between the dura mater and the petrous process of the temporal bone, whence it had found its way into the vertebral canal. This process was the seat of caries, and ra- ther a wide aperture had been made in its posterior surface. The cavity of the tympanum was filled with pus. The brain was moderately firm; but although it was dissected the day after death, it exhaled so offensive an odour that the examination could not be pursued.â€”Morgagni, xiv. 5*

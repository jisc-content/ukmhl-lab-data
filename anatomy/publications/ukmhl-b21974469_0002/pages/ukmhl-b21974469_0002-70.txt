30 the vessels of the pia mater were distended with blood. The right ventricle contained as much black and coagulated blood as would fill the shell of a hen’s egg; and some blood was contained in the other ventricles. There were vesicles in the pos- terior part of each choroid plexus. It was pro- bable that the blood had been effused from vessels ruptured in the left plexus choroides; but what- ever might have been the immediate source of this extravasation, it is unquestionable that whenever a vessel has been ruptured, the utmost care should be taken not to agitate the circulation of blood by con- cussions, such as arise from vomiting, coughing, or sneezing. I knew a plethoric gentleman, who died from apoplexy, with which he was attacked whilst straining to expel faeces, and a similar catastrophe has happened during parturition.—Morgagni,m. 11. Case 0. Apoplexy from extravasation into the right ventricle; with diseased liver. A Danish ambassador, sixty-four years of age, who was known to have some induration of the liver, was suddenly seized with paralysis of the left side, and speedily afterwards with apoplexy, so that he died in eight hours. Dissection. The liver was indurated. Many hydatids existed in the right plexus choroides, and more than four ounces of grumous blood were con- tained in the ventricle. *—Morgagnit iii. 18. * It might perhaps be questioned whether Morgagni accurately discriminated between vesicles and hydatids; the former often appear upon the choroid plexuses; probably, the true hydatid, but

178 well authenticated, and respecting those that are, we have but little satisfactory information as to the precise duration of the foramina without the faculty of hearing being lost. In some of the cases, too, the aperture might be exceedingly minute. Morgagni, xiv. 10. Ossification of the membrana fenestrce ovalis, and other causes of surditas. Where there is much accumulation of impacted cerumen, it is usually preceded by deafness from a cause that is more deeply seated, and on that account the meatus had been neglected. I observed this on an occasion when there was ossification of the small membrane which connects the basis of the stapes with the fenestra ovalis. The cerumen, after long continuance in the meatus, has sometimes acquired the hardness of stony matter.—Morgagni, xiv. 11. Deafness has been occasioned by a congenital thickening of the membrana tympani. A thick membrane has been observed exterior to the membrana tympani, which appears to be a process of cuticle, thickened perhaps by some dried sebacious matter.—12. Sometimes there is a layer of condensed wax upon the membrane; or the external meatus is obstructed either by a fleshy excrescence, or by an extraneous body.—13. A large quantity of thick mucus in the tympanum has likewise been productive of deafness, or, at least, has proved the cause of great dulness of hear- ing.—12.

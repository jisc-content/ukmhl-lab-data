174 SECTION XIII. Diseases of the Ear. As Valsalva and myself have published more on the diseases of the ear than of the eye, fewer obser- vations remain for publication. Case 1. Caries of the petrous portion of the temporal hone, from smallpox. A boy was afflicted with a disease in his right ear, as a sequel of small pox. When he was about twelve years of age, being deaf on that side, and having purulent discharge from the meatus, a cataract, but there is little in them worthy of citation. In a few of these instances the disorganization of the eye was such that the opaque lens was dislodged from its capsule, and was situated in the anterior chamber of the eye, where it had been nearly absorbed. It does not appear that he was aware to what extent absorption may be carried on, when fragments of the lens are placed within the solvent action of the aqueous humour. Nor is there any evidence of his having had an idea that the process he described would conduce to the removal of the disease, if there existed no lesion of the organ besides opacity in the lens. He mentions a family in which three sisters were affected with cataract, whilst three brothers were exempted from the disease; and he alludes to a similar occurrence relative to deafness. Some observations on diseases of the palpebrae are also brought forward; and amongst them he relates that whiteness of the eyelashes has appeared to be injurious to vision in a bright light. An example, he says, is extant in the works of Caspar Hoffman, of a person whose eyelashes were white, and who saw better whenever they were painted black. Within his own knowledge, men whose eye- lashes had been white from birth, uniformly became blind.â€”Ed,

336 Case 5. Inflammation of the diaphragm and brain in phthisis. A tall and slender man, who, being a hemp- dresser, was subject to thoracic inflammation. He had been affected in this way six or seven times. On one occasion the pulmonary affection was attended with bilious vomiting, and on another with phrenitis; and ultimately his organs of voice were so perverted, that he might be said to clang rather than to speak. By keeping tolerably free from the dust of his occupation he had nearly recovered his voice, when he was seized with febrile rigors, and a piercing pain beneath the left mamilla. He was brought into the hospital about the middle of February, and though he had pre- viously been bled, yet as he respired with difficulty, and did not expectorate any thing, the abstraction of blood was repeated. He often lay on the affected side. He vomited green bilious matter. On the fifth day phrenitis came on, and sometimes pre- sented a joyous, sometimes a grave, at others a furious character. He was again bled, and a medicated cataplasm was applied to the abraded scalp. Convulsive motions ensued, which com- menced with subsultus tendinum, but afterwards became more violent. His respiration was not dif- ficult. When asked if he felt pain anywhere, he replied in the negative, though he sometimes cried carried on by one lung, the other having been destroyed. In the preceding case the accumulation of pus might have resulted from common inflammation; but the tubercular state of the lungs denotes scrofulous diseases.â€”Ed.

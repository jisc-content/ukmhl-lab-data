549 hydrothorax, in which it is often the chief symptom. When hydrothorax is complicated with ascites, the difficulty of breathing is but very slightly relieved, if at all, when the fluid is drawn from the abdomen. The preceding observations show that this symptom is often extremely urgent, not only when dropsy of the thorax is combined with the same affection of the pericardium, but also in those cases in which there is no effusion into the latter cavity. But on the contrary, numerous cases have occurred, in which the pericardium was distended with fluid, without the disease being attended with dyspnoea. This, however, is not invariably the case, for the breathing is sometimes considerably affected, and decumbence rendered impracticable. Cases occurred to Lancisi in which the breathing was short and difficult, and the patients could only respire whilst they were out of bed; but as the period of death approached, and the fluid had accumulated to the quantity of a pint or a pint and half, the horizontal posture alone could be endured. The inability of sup- porting the erect position appeared to arise from the pressure made upon the centre of the dia- phragm.*—45. In the Commentaries of the Imperial Academy of Petersburg, Schreiberus has related a case in which the pericardium contained about four pints * Dr. Pearson has related a case in which, although the right side of the chest contained three pints of serous fluid, the patient could bear the recumbent posture better than the erect; and could lie upon the left side but not upon the right.—Ed.

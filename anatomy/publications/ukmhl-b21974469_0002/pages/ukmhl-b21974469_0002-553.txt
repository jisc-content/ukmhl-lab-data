thoroughly effected, the pulse returned to its former standard. In the Sepulchretum it is recorded that Ballonius had not only seen this affection of the pulse, but that he had also witnessed the removal of its languidness and smallness by a similar process. He says, “ pro gradibus purgationis pulsus restitue- “ batur.” There is, indeed, an intermission of the pulse of much longer duration, and Lancisi writes that he was affected with it for six years. When- ever it originates, as Lancisi reports it to have done in his case, “ ex hypochondriorum consensu,” it may be entirely removed by perfectly restoring the viscera in those parts.* Effects similar to those which arise from the nerves being irritated in the hypochondria may be produced from their irritation in any other part. In the following instance the intermission was maintained by anxiety of mind. An intelligent professor of physic at Bologna happened to discover that his pulse was intermittent, and being extremely anxious respecting it, as if it were impossible that it should occur from an accidental cause, he was often applying his fingers to his wrists; and he * Probably the stomach and liver were the organs chiefly affected. I am now attending a case in which the patieut, a gentleman thirty-six years of age, is occasionally seized with intermission in the action of the heart, and transient sensations of deliquia. These attacks are invariably accompanied with the usual symptoms of dyspepsia, and are removed by taking two or three alterative doses of mercury. But functional diseases of the heart do not exclusively arise from sympathy with the organs of digestion; I have observed it affected in a very extraordinary manner, as I have already mentioned, from sympathy with the uterus during abortion.—Ed.

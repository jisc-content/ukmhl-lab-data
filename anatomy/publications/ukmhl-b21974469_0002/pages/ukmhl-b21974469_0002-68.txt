28 ground; she suddenly fell down and became para- lytic in the whole left side of the body, and in the right arm; her face was pale, and her respiration natural. She lived nine hours. Dissection. The ventricles of the brain were filled with fluid blood; the right was extensively ulcerated around the external margin of the corpus striatum and the thalamus nervi optici; the left thala- mus also was slightly ulcerated; the plexus choroi- des could scarcely be observed.— Valsalva, ii. 13. The condition of the ventricles explained the relative paralysis; and the lesion of the optic thalami elucidated the defect of vision. Out of twenty- three cases of apoplexy examined by Valsalva and myself, it happened that only three were in youths, and four in men. From this case of the septuage- narian it is evident that paleness of countenance affords no argument against the existence of san- guineous apoplexy. Extravasation of blood does not prove fatal at equal periods of the disease; in one of the preceding cases the patient lived only nine hours, and in the other ten days. One of the principal criteria by which the urgency of apoplexy is determined, is the state of respiration; but in the woman above mentioned, this function remained undisturbed.—Morgagni, ii. 14. Case 4. Apoplexy from extravasation into the ventricle, the consequence of ulceration. An old man, long before his death had been attacked with apoplexy, from which the whole right side jof his body continued paralytic.

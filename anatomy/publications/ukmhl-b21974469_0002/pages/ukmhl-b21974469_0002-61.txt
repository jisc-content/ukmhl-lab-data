21 mater. Usually it occupies the ventricles, and such is the extenuation which occasionally results, that when surgeons have thought they merely perforated the dura mater, the brain itself, scarcely thicker than a membrane, was perforated also.—xii. 13. In a man who died cachectic, Morgagni found the septum lucidum and fornix were extremely flaccid, and a little fluid was deposited between the two laminae of that septum; the lateral ventri- cles at the same time contained bloody fluid. lxiii. 8. Amongst other causes of the accumulation of water in the head, hydatids should be mentioned; they have been found not only in the cranium, but in the brain of animals; and they have been dis- covered in the meninges of the human hydroce- phalic foetus. In a case recorded by Wepfer, the whole was a heap of compact vesicles full of limpid fluid.—xii. 6. SECTION IV. Spina bifida. The chronic form of hydrocephalus is so often connected with fluid in the spinal canal, that the circumstance of their having been associated in one letter admits of easy explanation. Fluid may* however, be deposited in one independent of the other, and may happen in adults as well as in foetuses and children. It occurs, indeed, with the greatest facility in foetuses, because in them the bones of the vertebrae readily yield, like the bones

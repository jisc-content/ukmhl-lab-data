402 That the thickness of the parietes of the heart instead of being diminished, should sometimes be increased when the ventricles are dilated, may be accounted for by supposing that the blood retained within the ventricle obstructs the return of blood from the substance of the heart: and at the same time a larger quantity of blood enters the coronary arteries, the aorta not allowing of the usual freedom of circulation through it; so that the parietes of the heart receive more blood than usual, whilst less is returned from them.— 35. Case 19. Aneurism of the heart, and dilatation of the aorta; the aorta ruptured into the pericardium by an indirect canal. A corpulent man about sixty years of age, died suddenly. He had been affected with tremour, and those who were acquainted with this circum- stance supposed that he died of apoplexy. Dissection. The pericardium was distended with a large quantity of blood. The heart was enlarged ; and the aorta was dilated above the heart, and the whole arch was diversified internally with bony scales, some of which were also found in the arteries of the limbs. On the internal sur- face of the great artery, not far from the heart, a foramen large enough to admit the finger origi- nated, and passing between the coats in an oblique direction, for about the space of three digits, it opened on the external surface of the artery, within the pericardium.— Morgagni, xxvi. 15.

105 dissection, as I was then teaching anatomy in the college. The arch of the cranium protuberated inwards, except in those parts where it is natu- rally thick; and it was incredibly thin. At one part on the right side of the os sincipitis, there was a foramen nearly large enough to admit the point of the little finger; which was closed with a membrane. There was no appearance of caries about the edges of this perforation, or in any other part of the cranium. With this foramen a small orifice in the dura mater corresponded, from which issued a fluid of a brown colour. This orifice communicated with a cavity sufficient to receive the bulk of a large egg. The cavity was filled with a fluid resembling that which has just been mentioned, in which some coagula of blood had subsided; it was of an irregular form; its surface was unequal, and the circumjacent parts of the brain were of a dirty brown colour, indicative of semiputrefaction. The corresponding thalamus of the optic nerve, though distant from the cavity, appeared shrunk; but in neither of the optic nerves, nor in either eye was there any perceptible disease. The left lateral ventricle contained a considerable quantity of pel- lucid fluid. The choroid plexuses were of a pale colour, and possessed a few small vesicles; the whole cerebrum was of an obsolete yellowish hue; and its vessels were exceedingly turgid with blood of a black colour.â€”Morgagni, ix. 20.

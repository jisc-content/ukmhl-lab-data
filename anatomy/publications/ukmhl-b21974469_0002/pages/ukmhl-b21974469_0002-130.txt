90 testes, and the pineal gland, were of a yellowish colour. The lateral ventricles contained fluid like that found in the pericardium, except that it was not thick; the surface of each ventricle was less smooth than usual, and in the left there was a more obvious diseased appearance. The medullary tract between the thalamus of the optic nerve, and the corpus striatum, was of a yellow colour, and almost liquified; and this corpus itself, when com- pared with the opposite, was much reduced in size, and wrinkled, as if there had been tabes of its substance. From the middle of it a tubercle projected, which in magnitude and figure resembled a large bean, and was of a red colour like a recent bruise on the skin. The remaining substance of the corpus striatum was yellow and so relaxed as to be nearly fluid.â€”Morgagni, xi. 11. Case 5. Paralysis from deposition of serum in the ventricles, and ulceration of the left ventricle. A man, about sixty years of age, fell suddenly, having lost the power of motion and the sense of feeling in the right side of his body. He scarcely replied when he was interrogated, and when he did speak, it was with a stammering tongue. During the whole time he survived this attack he voided but little urine, and never evacuated the bowels without enemata. At the commencement of the twenty-first day he had difficulty of respiration, which was the precursor of death.

227 was lacerated. The lateral sinuses of the dura mater were also ruptured, and the cerebellum itself had sustained injury.—Morgagni, lii, 25. Lesions of the cerebellum, in general, are more speedily destructive than equal injuries of the cerebrum; at least, this occurs in the more com- plicated animals. It must be admitted, however, that the cerebellum has frequently been the seat of considerable disease, and yet life itself has not been affected for a considerable period. To those diseases which are induced by degrees and which advance slowly, the body, in some measure, ac- commodates itself; and, as far as possible, supplies the deficiencies which result from suspended action in the diseased part.—26. I believe there will not be found more than two instances in the human subject, in which death has not very speedily ensued from violent wounds of the cerebellum. One is recorded by Petit re- specting a soldier, who, after a bullet had passed through the left lobe, survived forty-three hours; and the other is related by Binningerus concerning a Dutchman, who, (if no error has been committed,) lived more than four days after a small piece of bone had been extracted from its substance. In some cases of injury of the cerebellum the consequent paralysis was on the injured side, so that a doubt arose whether the seat of the causes producing hemiplegia may not generally be found to vary from that which happens in the cerebrum. Although there are so few examples of life being protracted after a considerable wound has been inflicted upon the cerebellum, yet every experienced Q 2

359 a great tendency in tendinous structures to become bony.—17. Boerhaave saw the septum of the heart and its cavities bony. In the history of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, A. D. 1726, Garengeot is reported to have found a bone in the heart reaching from one ventricle to the other. The person was seventy-two years of age. Senac not only relates histories of what had occurred in his own prac- tice, but has collected similar instances from others.*—18. Ossification of the mitral valves has been found to induce violent palpitation of the heart, accom- panied with a weak and unequal pulse, in conse- quence of their contracting the orifice at which they are placed, and from their not being adequate to prevent the return of some of the blood which had been admitted into the ventricle. Hence the circulation through the lungs was impeded, and the right cavities of the heart became dilated. The celebrated Reimannus having observed these symptoms, found one of the mitral valves rough and entirely ossified, as well as its chordae tendiniae and the carneae columnae. Morand found one of these valves dilated into a sac large enough to admit a man’s thumb. The man in whom it occurred had been subject to palpitation * Mr. Allan Burns met with a case in which the whole extent of the pericardium covering the ventricles, and the ventricles themselves, except about a cubic inch at the apex of the heart, were ossified and firm as the skull. And Mr. Charles Beli has, in his collection, specimens of a similar change of structure, though not to so great an extent. See a case by Dr. Prost, p. 355. Ed.

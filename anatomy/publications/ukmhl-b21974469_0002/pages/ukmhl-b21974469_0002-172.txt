132 pulmonary vein was occupied by a large quantity of fluid blood ; and the valves of the pulmonary artery were indurated. The vessels of the dura and pia mater were greatly distended with black and fluid blood, as were those also which are distributed upon the septum lucidum and the membrane of the lateral ventricles. The ventricles contained a large quan- tity of turbid fluid. The choroid plexuses were red and vesiculated; one of the vesicles was as large as a moderate-sized grape, in the coats of which, vessels as large as those in the plexus itself were observed. The cortical and medullary struc- tures of the cerebrum were indurated, whilst the cortical substance of the cerebellum was rather softer than natural.â€”Morgagni, viii. 4. Case 3. Insanity from deposition of serum and induration of the cerebrum, with disease of the heart. A butcher whose intellectual faculties had been deranged fourteen months, died in the beginning of 1719. It was supposed that his death was occa- sioned by exposure during a very cold season, to the effects of which he was inattentive. Dissection. The heart adhered to the pericar- dium universally. Serum was deposited beneath the pia mater, and the cerebrum was extremely firm in texture. Having reflected the indurated fornix, I observed near each of its pillars a kind of pellucid and knotted lymphatic; and they crept separately towards the pineal gland. The cerebrum and medulla oblongata were extremely firm, so

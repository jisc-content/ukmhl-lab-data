24 In the following instance the tumour of spina l)ifida was rashly opened. A boy was brought to me having a tumour on the lumbar vertebrae, which was soft, and in many places translucent: at birth it was small, but within ten months it had grown to the size of a fist; the boy was strong, and was well formed, even in his lower limbs, although they were weak. I cautioned the parents not to have the tumour opened. A surgeon, however, who being ignorant of its nature confi- dently promised to cure the disease, was permitted to thrust a knife into the middle of the tumour, from which, at first, a considerable quantity of limpid fluid, and, towards the last, some bloody fluid escaped; he afterwards introduced a tent into the orifice. The child did not cease to cry; the body trembled; the face became pale and wrinkled, and death followed on the third day. Dissection. The parietes of the tumour were collapsed and rugous, and consequently thicker than usual; if compressed a considerable quantity of fluid, in colour like pale urine, flowed from the wound; when its parietes were slit open the spinal marrow presented itself, invested with its pia mater, which was universally red from distended vessels ; the medullary substance of the chord, as well as the nerves proceeding from it, adhered closely to the middle of the parietes of the tumour longitudinally; and it was manifest that the other (coats had coalesced with the parietes.

ascribed it to congenital smallness of the superficial arteries. But this feebleness of pulsation is gene- rally the result of disease, and varies according to the circumstances in which it originates.—10. It has been shown to arise from disease in the aorta, and from adhesion of the pericardium to the heart, though the pulse is not unfrequently of an opposite character from this organic lesion. Senac has attempted to explain these contrarieties by referring to an increased resistance being at one time derived from excessive plenitude, whence it happens that not only does the fulness of the pulse increase after bleeding, but it becomes stronger. And he refers to the coats of the arteries being contracted, at another time, by nervous influence, a circumstance which happens in hysterical women. Some cases of asphyxia are of short duration, others protracted and fatal, not only in hysterical women, but in other persons, in whom there does not appear any thing to account for it, except nervous influence.—12. The following case of hydrops pericardii was attended with peculiar weakness of the pulse. Case 2. Weakness of pulse from hydrops pericardii, arid disease of the heart and liver. A middle-aged man, who was a hemp-dresser, came into the hospital of St. Mary de Morte in the spring of 1705, complaining of pain in the right hypochondrium. In this part there was an evident tumour, which resisted the hand, and appeared to be seated in the liver. The pulse was the smallest.

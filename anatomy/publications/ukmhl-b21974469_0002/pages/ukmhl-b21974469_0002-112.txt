72 was brought, at the beginning of the night, into St. Mary’s hospital at Bologna. His pulse was not frequent, but weak and unequal; and not so perceptible in one arm as in the other. His eyes glistened and were fixed. When interrogated he denied having any pain in the head, or any dis- position to somnolency; he vomited, and his tongue appeared to waver, yet the sense of feeling and the power of motion remained. During the night he gradually became worse, and died the following morning. Dissection. The abdominal viscera were moister than usual; the liver was of a whitish colour and somewhat indurated; the gall-bladder contained a dark-coloured bile. The transverse arch of the colon was contracted to the thickness of a thumb. The lungs adhered universally to the costal pleura, and when detached on the left side some fluid escaped, but whence it came I did not with certainty discover. The blood was fluid in the heart and in every other part of the body. When the body was decapitated, serous fluid distilled from the foramen magnum; and after the cranium had been opened a similar fluid was found every where within the skull, especially beneath the pia mater, where, in some parts, bubbles of air were mixed with it. There were some vesicles on the choroid plexuses.—Morgagni, iv. 35. Cerebral congestion after excessive loss of blood. There may be determination of blood to the head, and great turgescence of vessels, even when the patient appeared to have died of haemorrhage.

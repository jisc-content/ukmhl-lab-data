538 when impregnated with chyle, than any other body with which I could compare it. Both cavities of the thorax were occupied by a large quantity of a greenish fluid ; and the pericar- dium contained nearly two pints of a fluid having a bloody appearance ; but this colour might owe its origin to a delay of some days in opening this capsule. The heart was nearly covered with a rather thick accumulation of fat. When the cranium was opened, serum was found to be deposited between the membranes of the brain, and in the ventricles.—Morgagni, xvi. 36. Though it was evident, during life, that serum had been effused into the thorax, yet some of the symptoms which usually denote thoracic dropsy were absent. If in these cases a sense of fluctua- tion was constantly perceived, we might dispense with other symptoms when there had been no pro- bable cause of suppuration; but although fluctua- tion is sometimes made apparent to others as well as felt by the patient, yet it does not uniformly exist, and indeed cannot occur when a large quantity of fluid is accumulated.—37.

239 The point of the weapon entered about three digits below the external ear, and pursued a direction to- wards the beginning of the spinal marrow. Scarcely any blood was effused from the wound, yet the young man fell, and was deprived of sensibility and motion in all the parts below the head. He spoke but little, and even that was attended with some difficulty of respiration. When put into bed he complained of coldness ; and to remedy this incon- venience a warming pan was resorted to, by which his legs were severely burnt without his being con- scious of pain. At first he neither evacuated the bladder nor intestines; but after some days the urine flowed involuntarily. About the seventeenth day he began to have some feeling in the left side, and on the twentieth day he was able to move the fingers and toes on that side a little. On the thirty- second day he discovered returning sensation on the right side: and the degree of sensibility gradu- ally improved, so that by the fortieth day the man had regained tolerably perfect feeling, and also considerable power of motion. Some months elapsed, however, before he was able to stand; and even then he continued more infirm on the right side than on the left; and the sensibility also of the left side was the most complete.â€”Morgagni,\m. 23.

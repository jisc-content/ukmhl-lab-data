303 menstruated less freely tlian usual, was attacked with a piercing pain in the thorax, and difficulty of day febrile symptoms recurred, accompanied with some wander- ing pains : he passed a distressing night, and early the following morning my attendance was requested. He complained of almost intolerable pain in the loins, extending thence to the thorax, and especially through the region of the diaphragm, but rather on the right side. His respiration appeared to be carried on without the action of this septum.

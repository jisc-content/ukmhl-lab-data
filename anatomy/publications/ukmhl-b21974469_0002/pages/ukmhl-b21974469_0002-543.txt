503 carotid artery, where that artery emerged from the canalis caroticus, was thickened, and of a nature that may be ranked between ligament and cartilage. A similar alteration of structure had commenced in some larger arteries of the cerebrum. Exterior to the cranium this disease was more considerable; for on one side of the neck, at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, a rather large bony scale was found between the coats of the vessel; and the trunk of the same artery was dilated universally, to a considerable degree. The aorta, near the valves, and in some other places, exhibited the rudiments of ossification.â€”Morgagni, xxiv. 6. I apprehend that the asphyxia may be ascribed to the sudden deposition of serous fluid; in the same way that it was produced in a boy, whose cerebellum was partially destroyed by suppuration, and who was without pulsation during many days before his decease.* In the case of a young man, in whom the asphyxia was attributed, as it often is, to polypi in the heart, that organ was found greatly enlarged, and its fibres extremely flaccid.| In a woman, whose heart was enlarged, and who had a frequent recurrence of asphyxia, I thought that circumstance wras inexplicable with- out supposing the existence of spasm. For as often as she was seized with convulsive asthma, or w ith paroxysms which resembled that disease, and was brought into the hospital, her pulse was imper- ceptible.]; This failure of the pulse often occurs to hysterical women. * Vide page 173. t Page 382.

811 painful side cough was excited. The pain after- wards ceased, and of this she had no recurrence: and the pulse, though retaining other morbid qualities, became less frequent. On the fourth day she was attacked with shivering succeeded by heat, and was considerably worse. Her cough had hitherto been dry, but she now expectorated fetid and bloody pus, of a dark colour. She could only respire when the neck was elevated. The pulse became smaller and more languid, and the pus of a livid hue. Slight delirium also came on; and during the latter days of life the quotidian accession of fever was later than it had been. In the middle of the sixth day she died, apparently from sudden suffocation. Dissection. Each cavity of the thorax contained a small quantity of an ash-coloured and offensive serum, and the lungs adhered slightly and loosely to the costal pleura. This membrane, in some places on the left side, where the lung had been adherent, was rough and unequal, from bodies which appeared like small and red tubercles.* At the lower part of the lung, on this side, there was a concretion of lymph in the form of a double mem- brane, one portion adhering to the lung, the other * The substances mentioned in this case may have been granu- lated portions of lymph, which, we may infer from their colour, had become organized. At the same time it is unquestionable that the pleura has been the seat of tubercular affections from other causes. Steatomatous tumours, and hydatids have also existed in this membrane. The tubercular accretions of serous membranes will be more particularly considered under diseases of the peritoneum, and hydatids. Ed.

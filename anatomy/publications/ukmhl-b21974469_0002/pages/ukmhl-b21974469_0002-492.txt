452 / Case 1. Aneurism of the aorta. Anthony Ferrarini, of a melancholic tempera- ment, and with a disposition to cachexia, con- stantly spat a large quantity of saliva impregnated with acrid salts. During twelve months he had been annoyed with violent and almost ceaseless cough, united with some difficulty of breathing, especially when ascending an acclivity. About the end of August 1689, he was suddenly attacked in the middle of the night, with such oppressive anguish at the chest that he expected immediate suffocation : nevertheless, by expectorating a con- siderable quantity of mucus, the agony ceased. But after an interval of two days, when evacuating the intestines, he was seized with a similar paroxysm, though in a mitigated degree; and subsequent to that seizure, he was constrained to respire with the neck upright. He experienced is actually productive of greater firmness in those parts, in con- sequence of an effusion of lymph. All aneurisms, however, are not formed by the destruction of the inner and middle coats ; for, in consequence of some previous lesion of their texture impairing the elasticity of a portion of the vessel, it sometimes gives way, and there is a partial dilatation of the three coats into an aneurismal sac. I conceive that we may safely drop the division of aneurisms into species; but we cannot understand the pathology of the disease without being aware that it often presents a diversity of structure, though generally preceded by the same deviation of the parietes of the vessel from the natural state. The deposition of calcareous matter is sometimes so extensive, that the parietes of the sac have appeared to be constituted of osseous substance. An interesting case of this nature has been related by Mr. Liston, in the Ed. Med. Journal for January 1821. Ed.

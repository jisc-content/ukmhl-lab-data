395 appearance which has been described. The outer coat of the artery, as it receded from the trunk, became so much extenuated that it could scarcely be distinguished where it was exterior to the thorax. The pai'ts which had been carried for- wards with the sac, and which surrounded it, would prevent the blood from being easily effused by the ruptured aneurism. The inner coat was thickened and appeared to consist of different membranes like flesh—membranes which, in some parts, were as thick as the finger, and which in others were lacerated.* The sac contained grumous blood. When the cedematous limbs were dissected, no serum was found between the muscular fibres; the whole was limpid, and seemed to be deposited in the dilated cells of the adipose membrane; and on the fluid being exposed to heat it did not become turbid, but wholly evaporated. However, the deep yellow serum which was found in the thorax, not only became turbid, but a pellicle formed upon its surface, and was ultimately left in the bottom of the vessel. The serum of the abdomen formed a pellicle, but did not become cloudy.— Valsalva, xvii. 25. From the preceding case, as well as from others, it will appear that although an aneurism be perpe- tual, some of its consequences may not uniformly be experienced. If from any slight internal cause, such as the swallowing of food or drink, or the existence of flatus in the oesophagus, pressure is made on the aneurism; or if from accidental * These were laminated concretions of lymph.—Ed.

362 Dissection. The heart was found ulcerated, and contained a polypous concretion. Morgagni, xxv. 17. Many cases of ulceration of the heart have been witnessed by different anatomists, some of whom have not clearly described the symptoms. In some of the cases of ulceration of this viscus, men- tioned in the Sepulchretum, there was intermission of the pulse but no deliquia; in others deliquia and no intermission.—20. The heart has been found in different states of ulceration. Olaus Borrichius found it deeply ulce- rated, and the ulcer in a sloughing state: but he does not mention either syncope or intermission of the pulse. Peter Marchetti has related a case in which an ulcer penetrated to the left ventricle; the symptoms which he mentions as having existed were, emaciation, debility, and fever. From nu- merous instances recorded by Senac, in the chapter on inflammations, abscesses, and ulcers of the heart, it appears that inequality of the pulse is not a necessary consequence of ulceration of the heart; but, in those cases, frequent deliquia are said to have occurred. In the cases which have occurred to Valsalva and me, the erosions were small, but they could be clearly distinguished from those concretions which by their inequality and colour resemble ulceration. In them there was neither intermission of the pulse nor syncope; but in cases observed by Albertini there were slight deliquia.—21, 24. In a case in which a tubercle had formed upon the heart of an old man, neither intermission of the

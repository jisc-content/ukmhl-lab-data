410 valves were indurated and thick, and the edges of all the semilunar valves were white and hard, and were so thickened as to equal a line and a half of the inch of Bologna. The trunk of the aorta was considerably dilated from its valves to the curvature; and beyond this part its diameter was sensibly increased, though in a smaller degree. Throughout this tract its parietes were thickened, and felt much harder than is usual; and its inner surface was rendered unequal, especially within the space of its greatest expansion, by numerous white and yellowish rudi- ments of ossification. In the lateral ventricles of the brain there was a considerable excess of fluid, similar to that which occupied the thorax; and the falx was thick and hard, but the texture of the brain was healthy. It was evident that the blood had issued from the meningeal vessels, which had been lacerated by the saw ; and probably it was mixed with serum.* Morgagni, xxvi. 33. During the time of carrying bodies from one place to another, and turning them about on every side, sometimes having the head downwards, and at others the feet, the blood, especially if fluid, as it was in the preceding instance, and in many others, is liable to be dislodged. Therefore we are not to * Consistent with what has been said on the subject of apo- plexy from active aneurism of the left ventricle of the heart, it may be supposed that plethora of vessels in the head would generally arise from aneurism of that cavity of the heart; but a state of vascular plenitude, and even apoplexy, have arisep from dilatation of the auricles.â€”Ed.

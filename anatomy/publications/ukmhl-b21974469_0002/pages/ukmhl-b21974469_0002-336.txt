296 obtained his livelihood by sifting wheat, an employ- ment which is always pernicious to the lungs. He had recovered from an attack of pleurisy, but, un- fortunately, had a relapse, and died on the eleventh day. The symptoms under which he laboured were, an obtuse pain in the thorax, particularly on the right side, as well as frequent cough with but little expectoration; and the sputum which he did eject was viscid and bloody. His face was florid, his pulse was hard, greatly confused, unequal, and intermittent; he was not wholly exempt from con- vulsive tremors, and was unable to respire except when sitting up. The blood, which was repeatedly withdrawn, had a thick buffy coat on its surface. There was intumescence of the abdomen, and the feet and legs were cedematous. Dissection. As soon as the cartilages of the ribs were divided, serum issued from the thorax. There was a large quantity of this fluid in both cavities, but especially in the right; and concretions floated in it like the dregs of wine. No adhesion had been contracted with the costal pleura, but, on both sides, this membrane was redder than it is in the healthy state : this increased vascularity, however, was greatest on the left side. The inferior lobe of the right lung was hard and turgid, and when incised it was discovered to be unusually dense in its structure, and of a brownish purple colour. There was an excess of fluid in the pericardium, and the heart was enlarged, in consequence of dilatation of the ventricles, more particularly of the right; but the parietes of these cavities were not thickened.

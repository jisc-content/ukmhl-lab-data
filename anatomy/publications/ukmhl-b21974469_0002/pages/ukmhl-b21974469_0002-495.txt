455 evidently labouring under phthisis. It is proper to remark that a tumour in the thorax has produced some of the symptoms of aneurism. The existence of the disease must not be determined by one or two of the ordinary phenomena which indicate it; most of them ought to be regarded, to avoid deception. During certain passions of the mind, the circula- tion of blood through the lungs is often powerfully excited, and sometimes as forcibly retarded, which the face, respiration, and pulse clearly demon- strate. We cannot therefore be surprised if from violent efforts to suppress or conceal indignation, aneurisms of the heart and aorta should originate. Such is the power of human passions in dilating the channels and receptacles of blood in the thorax, that Albertini justly deduced an argu- ment from the absence of this influence ii* brutes, to account for these dilatations being so rarely found in them, and so often in the human subject. When, therefore, these, or any other probable causes have preceded—when most of the symp- toms which usually characterize the disease are present—when there are no indications of other diseases in the thorax—and when the effects of remedies are considered—we may be prepared to conjecture that aneurism exists.—19. The absence of pulsation, as in the case just related, and in numerous others, is a circumstance which has misled many physicians. There may be pulsation independent of aneurism of the artery, and aneurism may exist without pulsation. Some- times it is very obscure from the commencement ;

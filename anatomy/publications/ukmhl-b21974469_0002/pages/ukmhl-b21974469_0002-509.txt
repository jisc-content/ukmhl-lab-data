469 digits in depth, whilst the subjacent red portion did not exceed two. After this he was occa- sionally seized with syncope. He progressively became worse, and on the latter days of his life his face was greatly swelled. At length, whilst carried from one bed to another, he suddenly expired. Dissection. The intestines, anteriorly, were adherent to the omentum, and laterally, the con- volutions were united to one another. The other abdominal viscera were firmly connected to the contiguous parts. The pleura pulmonalis adhered to the costal pleura, and on the left side to the mediastinum and diaphragm also. The bronchial glands were enlarged. The coats of the aorta were indurated, and beset internally with bony scales; and they were also dilated into an aneurism three digits in breadth and a span in length. At about the fourth dorsal vertebra the dilatation was greater; and the body of this vertebra was hollowed out, and its place occupied by the aneurism. The union between the aneurism and the bone was so firm, that they could not be disjoined without lacera- tion. A coagulum, which originated in the left ventricle of the heart, extended into the aneurism. There was an accumulation of serum in the left cavity of the thorax, and it contained a large coagulum of blood, which probably had escaped from the aneurism, though no trace of rupture was discovered.â€” Valsalva, xvii. 17.

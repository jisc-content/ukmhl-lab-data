324 varnish, probably arose from the white humour, which pervaded the cells of these viscera, shining through the transparent membranes.—4. Ossified curtilages; and calcarions concretions. The cartilages of the trachea and bronchia sometimes become bony, even before the person is far advanced in years. Calculi are likewise some- times formed within the bronchi*. The bronchial glands within, and exterior to the lungs, occasion- ally become hard like gypsum. Yet I believe these calculi more frequently originate from the long retention of tenacious secretions within the ramifications of the bronchi*, and in the air-cells. Many cases are extant in which the calculi are represented to have been coughed up; and in some of those instances they were considerable in number; and varied in magnitude, from the size of a millet seed to that of a pea or bean. They have been brought up when as large as a small peach- stone or a filbert nut, but this is an extraordinary occurrence. They are also described as having been found in the lungs equal to the size of a walnut, or of a pigeon’s egg.—Morgagni, xv. 19, 20. They usually resemble the concretions which are formed in the joints of arthritic patients, and consequently are friable, light, and chalky. An asthma or an orthopncea is often found to accom- pany them ; but more frequently they are attended with an obstinate cough, and not very seldom with haemoptysis and phthisis. In one of the recorded instances it is said there was no cough, but a continued pain in the right side. In another, the patient suffered acute pain

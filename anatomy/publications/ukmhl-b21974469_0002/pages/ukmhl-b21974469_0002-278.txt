238 Dislocation of the vertebrae. It has been a subject of controversy whether the vertebrae are fractured or luxated with the greater facility. Valsalva and myself have inspected the vertebral column after most violent blows, and though we have found the vertebrae fractured, we have never detected a luxation. If, indeed, the ligaments have been diseased, there has been an unnatural inclination of the spine to one side; but I am now speaking of displacement from external violence without any preexisting imperfection. I will not deny the possibility of this occurrence; though I do not know that it has ever been demon- strated by a post mortem examination that luxation has happened without the bones being broken. Many cases certainly are recorded, but they are not conclusive, because the accuracy of the dis- sections cannot be relied upon.*—Morgagni, lvi. 35. The following is an interesting case of recovery from an injury of the beginning of this medullary process. Case 3. Lesion of the medulla spinalis. A young man twenty-four years of age, received a wound from a dagger on the left side of the neck. * The strength of the processes of the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae, and the manner in which they are locked together, as well as the strength of their ligamentous and muscular union, renders it impossible for displacement to occur without fracture ; but it has been stated, on the highest authority, that dislocation of any of the cervical vertebrae is possible, though a very rare occurrence; and that it generally happens between the first and second.—Ed.

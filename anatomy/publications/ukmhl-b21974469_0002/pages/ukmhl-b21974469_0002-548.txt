508 Some light may yet be thrown upon this obscure subject, if the body of a woman who is perhaps still living at Paris should be examined with that attention which the case deserves. In this female asphyxia has existed from birth, and no pulsation has been perceived in any artery, or indeed in the heart, even after the most violent exertions, or in the highest temperature of fever—a disease to which she is peculiarly liable. The case is related in the Hist, de l’Acad. R. des Sc. A. 1748.—9. Scarcely any disease more approximates to a state of asphyxia than a remarkably small pulse, united with debility. Sometimes there is naturally a slender pulse, and this I supposed to be the case with a robust woman, habituated to considerable exertion, who was violently attacked with angina; but although the pulse was extremely small, I was not deterred from withdrawing as much blood as the urgency of the disease required. After her recovery, however, I found that the pulse was the same as it had been during her illness, and I accession was produced by agitated feelings, and suddenly terminated the life of this extraordinarily useful man. Dissection. The coats of the stomach and of the intestines were loaded with blood. The pericardium was thickened, so that it did not collapse on being opened. The heart was very small, and seemed to be contracted, or rather shrunk in size. The muscular structure of this organ was paler in colour and of a looser texture than the other muscles. The coronary arteries were converted into bony tubes. The mitral valves were ossified in places, and the aortic valves did not retain their usual pliancy. There was an incipient aneurism of the aorta. The vessels of the pia mater were turgid with blood; the carotid artery, in the sella tursica, was ossified, and the vertebral artery was bony.—Ed.

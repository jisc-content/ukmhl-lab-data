when roused by irritating the nostrils and the sole of the right foot, he was capable of expressing himself by signs, and by a few words; and these irritations had a happier effect after bleeding, espe- cially about four hours after the right jugular vein had been opened on the sixth day from the attack of apoplexy, when his mental faculties and the power of speech were temporarily restored. A similar change happened on the following night; and, indeed, the recovery of his understanding was then more complete and of longer duration. From this period he gradually declined; he was seized, at intervals, with convulsive motions in the right side, especially in the hand and foot; his face and eyes were convulsed, and perhaps the heart itself, for often no pulsation could be perceived He died about the tenth day. Dissection. Every thing appeared natural in the thorax and abdomen. The brain was flaccid ; the left ventricle contained a little serum; and the right more than two ounces of coagulated blood; the plexus choroides was lacerated, and the posterior part of the parietes of the ventricle was deeply ulcerated.—Valsalva, ii. 9. In this great man various circumstances con- curred to the production of apoplexy—his studious habits, close application to important business, anxiety, and the gout.

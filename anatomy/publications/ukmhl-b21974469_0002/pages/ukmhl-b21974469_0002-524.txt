484 spots, and a small protuberance on the inner surface of the artery, where it w as affixed to the vertebrae; the prominence, however, though unna- tural, w^as constituted of the natural substance of the artery. From the origin of the left carotid artery to the heart, the vessel was w ider than usual, and internally was rugged and unequal from bony lamellae, which were so numerously distributed as scarcely to leave any intervals betw een them. In these small interstices the internal coat of the vessel was attenuated by ulceration; and at one place the blood had gradually insinuated itself through one of the intervals, detaching and ele- vating the external coat from the inner, so that there was an appearance of extended ecchymosis ; and coagulated blood existed at that part. By the continued distension the blood had ultimately burst the exterior tunic, and was extravasated into the pericardium.—Morgagni, xxvi, 17. The circumstance that death so speedily occurs from the extravasation of no larger a quantity of blood than can be contained in the pericardium, may surprise some persons. For if we suppose it to be distended, and then to contain two pints, as has been estimated ; yet a much larger quantity is often lost in haemorrhages within twelve or fifteen hours. Here, how ever, the blood is effused at once, and flows from the very trunk of the aorta near its origin—circumstances which mate- rially differ from its flowing gradually out of distant branches: and its escape into the pericar- dium must be distinguished from its discharge externally. Although the heart continues to act

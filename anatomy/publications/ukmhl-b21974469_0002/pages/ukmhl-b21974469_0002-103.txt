63 ulceration: the right ureter was so dilated on coming out from the kidney as to equal a hen’s egg; and the coats of the bladder were thickened. The right lobe of the lungs adhered closely to the pleura costalis ; the whole surface of the heart was united with the pericardium; its ventricles contained blood of a black colour, and which in its consistence resembled tar, more of which flowed from the inferior vena cava when it was divided; the carotid arteries were greatly dilated. Although six days had elapsed before the brain was examined, the cerebrum was remarkably firm ; and the cerebellum moderately so. A considerable quantity of serous fluid was effused not only between the membranes, but also in the ventricles of the brain. The vessels of the pia mater were more turgid than usual; there was a little fluid in the duplicature of the septum lucidum; and a considerable number of vesicles on the choroid plexuses. Both the posterior branches of the carotid arteries, which usually are minute, were exceedingly dilated: the coats of other vessels had become opaque, and contained small whitish protuberances, almost cartilaginous, some of which were rather like excrescences than in that state which precedes ossification.—Morgagni, iv. 19.

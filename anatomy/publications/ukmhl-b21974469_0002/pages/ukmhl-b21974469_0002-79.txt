39 thirty years before, sufficient to receive his finger; and as this could not have happened without a laceration of blood vessels, he maintained that the blood or pus must have been absorbed.—ii. 16. Case 14. Apoplexy from extravasation into the left hemisphere. An old man died apoplectic in the hospital at Padua, about the beginning of December 1744. He had been seized thirty days before, and at length became senseless, and fell into a state of mus- cular immobility. His eyes were extremely red. jDissection. The upper part of the right lobe of the lungs was indurated and contained a tubercle in a state of suppuration; the corpora sesamoidea in the semilunar valves of the aorta, were enlarged and of a white colour. Beneath the right hemisphere of the brain a small quantity of blood was extravasated, and the vessels of the pia mater were exceedingly turgid. \%jthin^e substance of the left hemisphere there was a cavity, tfee length of which was at least equal to jfche breadth of five fingers, and its width to that of two and a half; it contained a considerable quantity of blood, partly coagulated; the parietes of the cavity presented a lacerated appearance; the circumjacent parts of the brain, involving the corpus striatum and the thalamus nervi optici were very soft; the lateral ventricles contained a small quantity of bloody fluid.—Morgagni, lx. 2. It is probable that extravasation to so great an extent had not taken place at once, but had been gradually increasing from the earliest period of the attack. Whenever apoplexy is threatened, it is

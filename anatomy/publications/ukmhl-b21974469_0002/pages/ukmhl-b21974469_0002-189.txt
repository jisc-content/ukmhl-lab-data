J49 Hydrophobia independent of the infection of rabies. Instances of hydrophobia have occurred without having been preceded by the bite of an animal, in which the morbid appearances of the pharynx, lungs, intestines, and stomach coincided with those which arise from the infection of rabies contagiosa. Two cases of this nature originated from drinking a cold fluid whilst the body was greatly heated. One was dissected by the celebrated Genselius, who found the muscles and glands of the pharynx of a red colour, and the stomach appeared as if it had been dried. The rest of the viscera were in a natural state. This hydrophobic patient, though he trembled at the light, and at the sight of white linen, and could not endure even to look at some liquids, yet was not distressed at their being named, as it occurred in two other instances. Numerous cases are on record, especially in the observations of Schenck, which, as well as these, shew that true hydrophobia may be brought on without conta- gion.*—viii. 31. Though the diversities both in the symptoms and morbid appearances are so great, I consider the principal seat of the disease to be the brain and nervous system. As, however, effects only are * There is no reason to suppose that rabies contagiosa is ever spontaneously generated in the human body, or derived from any other source than contagion. The cases referred to being cha- racterized by the water-dread may be regarded, however, as a simulation of that disease.—Ed»

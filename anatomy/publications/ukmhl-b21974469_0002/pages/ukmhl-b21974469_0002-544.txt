504 Riolanus reports that he has known persons live many years with this state of pulse, but it was accompanied with extreme debility. Sometimes the pulse is not perceived in conse- quence of an unnatural smallness, or of an unusual distribution of those arteries which physicians are accustomed to feel, or of some obstruction in them. They are small in those persons in whom they are divided into numerous branches higher up than usual, or in whom the ulnar artery is larger than the radial. Their distribution is unnatural when they are situated unusually deep, or when they run upon the back of the radius.—7. Other examples of that kind of natural asphyxia, either in one or both wrists, may be found in the Sepulchretum. In such cases as these, we must guard against being deceived, and if the state of the artery in one arm should awaken alarm, the examination of the other ought not to be omitted: and should there exist deficiency of pulsation in both the wrists, the attention should be directed to other arteries, as the temporal, carotid, or the femoral in the groin. An asphyxia of either description may happen from an accidental obstruction of one or of both the radial arteries, by means of a coagulum, or from some other cause. In a case of peripneumony, the pulse of the right wrist was nearly imperceptible, and it appeared to have occurred in consequence of an induration of the lung on that side, by which the right subclavian artery had been compressed.*—8. * Corvisart, after noticing the great diversities in the state of the pulse during diseases of the heart, observes, “ One of the

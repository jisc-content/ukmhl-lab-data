235 The dura mater was greatly thickened where it lay beneath the diseased cranium, and adhered very closely to the part which had received the blow. On the left side the vessels of this membrane were loaded with blood, and considerably dilated; and the traces of them in the remaining sound part of the skull, were much deeper on this side than on the right. The vessels of the plexus choroides were in a state of turgescence, and there was an accumulation of serum at the basis of the cerebrum. JEpist. lii. 38. Garellius has in his possession a thigh bone having a tumour upon it the size of a man’s fist, perforated with caries in several places, and sending forth three bony processes, the largest of which was equal to a finger in length and thickness. The foramen through which the medullary artery entered the bone, though naturally very small, was enlarged to such a degree as easily to admit the little finger. In two other thigh bones similar changes had taken place. He entertained the opinion that the vessels were in an aneurismal state. *—lii. 39. * The former of these cases affords an exceedingly fine speci- men of fungous exostosis, originating from the diploe of the cranium; and its highly vascular structure associates it with fungus haematodes. The description of the latter case is too con- cise; but, I think we may infer, that it was an instance of carti- laginous exostosis, from the medullary membrane; and the dilated state of the medullary artery in this thigh bone, and also in the two others alluded to, resembles the enlargement of the nutrient arteries of sarcomatous and other tumours of the soft parts.—Ed.

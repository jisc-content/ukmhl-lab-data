450 the right cavities of the heart arise, inequality of pulse is not likely to ensue; but, frequently, there is palpitation. The distinguished Chomel remarked that a man whose pulmonary artery w as ossified internally and externally, and whose heart was very much enlarged, had been annoyed by fre- quent palpitations : but in a maiden dissected by Valsalva, although the valves at the entrance of the pulmonary artery were so united together as scarcely to leave an aperture equal to the diameter of a lentil, so that blood was delayed in the right cardiac cavities, which had become dilated, yet palpitation was not observed among the symp- toms.*—Morgagni, xxiii. 14. Aneurism of the aorta. Those cases of this disease will be first adduced in which the vessel was merely dilated ; and after- wards those in which the aneurism had ruptured. A peculiar interest attaches to the first case, from the circumstance of its having occurred in the person of Anthony Ferrarini, one of the first physicians at Modena. I have collected the par- ticulars from the papers of Malpighi, whose iftatter, nature had closed again.” Morgagni has alluded to an instance in which the large pulmonary vessels were found com- pletely divided, though there had been no haemorrhage. See page 335. It is probable that, during the destruction of the viscus, its vessels were secured in the manner to which I have adverted. During inflammatory action the vasa vasorum also may effuse coagulable lymph. Mr. Hodgson has recorded one instance, in which the femoral artery and profunda were obliterated by fungoid excrescens.es similar to those which form on valves.—Ed. * Vide page 375.

314 existed. They were hemispherical, and of the size of vetches. Although these appearances were less numerous within the right cavity, nevertheless the above description was applicable to many parts of the pleura on that side. The membrane did not exhibit the least appearance of heightened vascu- larity on either side. The pericardium contained a small quantity of a somewhat bloody fluid. The inguinal glands were enlarged; and there existed a hernia in the right groin; and fluid in the tunica vaginalis testis. I suspected this fluid arose from a ruptured hydatid, in consequence of observing a small and almost solid and flesh- coloured body, attached, by a peduncle, to the tunica albuginea, where it surrounds the belly of the testicle. This tubercle appeared to be the residue of a vesicle, and seemed to be constituted of its contracted and thickened parietes. Morgagni, xxi. 19. The concretions said to have been expectorated might be similar to those which sometimes form in the uterus and in the intestines. I have seen them bearing the form of the trachea, which they exhi- bited when floated in water. Ruysch and Chesel- den have represented ramified concretions of this nature; they have been seen by other anatomists, and when hollow were supposed to be veins.â€”19. Haller found the pleura callous, but never ossi- fied ; and Hottinger observed it converted into a texture not unlike cartilage, a change which he conjectured to have arisen from pleurisy, under which the woman had laboured some years before. Perhaps the cases of Haller, and that of the old

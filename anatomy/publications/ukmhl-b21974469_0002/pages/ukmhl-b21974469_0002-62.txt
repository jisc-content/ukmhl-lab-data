22 of the cranium. At one time some of the vertebrae are bifid; and at others, all of them. By the fluid pressing against the membranes of the medulla spi- nalis, a tumour is formed upon the posterior sur- face, proportionate to the quantity of water, as in hydrocephalus. The vertebrae are chiefly deficient in the situation of the spinous processes, not only because the bones are naturally disjoined in that part, but more particularly, in my opinion, because there is less resistance there than laterally, where the muscles and tendons are situated. Ruysch was surprised that this tumour did not more fre- quently protrude at the inferior and outer part of the os sacrum, where there is naturally an opening. But the tube of the dura mater containing the cauda equina does not descend quite so low ; it has sometimes, however, been urged downwards. In a case of this kind, in which the dropsy was com- mon to the cranium and spine, Genga punctured the tumour with extraordinary success. The hy- drocephalus succeeded a contusion on the head, and about a month after it was discovered, the tumour at the os coccygis appeared. Although the child was nearly four years old, yet when pres- sure was made upon the head, serum escaped from the punctured orifice at the extremity of the sacrum. *—Morgagni, xii. 9.

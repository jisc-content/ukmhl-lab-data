In the Sepulchretum a case of sudden effusion into the cavities of the chest, and the removal of the fluid by paracentesis, is related. It occurred to a young man after excessive exercise on horse- back. When the body was agitated, fluctuation was distinctly perceived on the left side of the chest, and the fluid was drawn through a canula, and continued to issue afterwards through an orifice kept open by artificial means.*—5. Tozzius and Albertini have described cases in which they found serum in the lungs themselves. When effusion takes place into the texture of these viscera it constitutes what may properly be considered as dropsy of the lungs.f—33. * Paracentesis thoracis has often been performed successfully in cases of empyema, and sometimes in hydro thorax; but in instances of the latter description, though'no doubt may exist as to the accumulation of fluid, there may be the greatest uncer- tainty as to the cavity it occupies. In the Transactions of the King’s and Queen’s College in Ireland, vol. 2, Dr. Archer has related a case in which this operation was performed, and eleven pints of fluid were drawn from the right cavity. The discharge ceased at the expiration of four months. Morgagni did not bestow so much attention on the state of the urine in dropsy, as on other symptoms. Dr. Blackall is entitled to the merit of having particularly directed attention to the excretion of serum by the kidneys, which* in many cases, is so abundant that the urine is coagulable by h< also probable, that the presence of serum in the urine is not confined to dropsical cases, though it may but seldom occur dropsical at. It is under other circumstances.—JSt/. t See a case of this description in note page 354.—-Ed.

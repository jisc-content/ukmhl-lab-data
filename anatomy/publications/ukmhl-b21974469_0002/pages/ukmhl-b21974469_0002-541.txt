501 ligature with the artery, was enlarged into a ganglion at the bend of the elbow. Haller and other anatomists have found the collateral branches enlarged, though not equally, when the course of an artery has been intercepted. It seems probable that sometimes only one branch may be dilated, and at others more.—8. There is not much reason to hope for recovery, after the division of the large vessels of the neck. If the carotid artery is divided, it is not sufficient to tie the lower orifice ; a ligature must, be applied upon the upper also. Schlichtingius has related an instance of the cure of a wound inflicted on the internal jugular vein.*—liii. 22. Asphyxiaj", and other peculiarities of the pulse. Cases of asphyxia from adhesion between the pericardium and heart—from a diseased state of the cerebellum—and from lesion in the valves of the heart, and in the vessels, have been related; and * The precaution of applying two ligatures should not be con- fined to the carotid artery. Some years ago I witnessed an instance in which a man bled to death from a wound of the brachial artery, in consequence of the surgeon neglecting to tie the lower orifice. In the recurrence of haemorrhage the case precisely resembled that just related by Morgagni, and whenever the surgeon was called he found no haemorrhage. At length, however, the patient sunk under the repeated loss of blood.—Ed. f The term asphyxia has been applied to two morbid states of the body. In one case, it denotes a total suspension of all the mental and corporal functions; and in the other, a failure or cessation of the pulse, with little or no disturbance of perception er of voluntary power—Good’s Nosology. The appellation is .employed by Morgagni in the latter sense.—Ed.

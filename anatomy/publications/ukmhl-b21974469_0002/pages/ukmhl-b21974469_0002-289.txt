249 I am indebted to Mediavia for the following case. Case 6. Dyspnoea from a suppurated tumour behind the trachea. A woman upwards of eighty years of age, had complained, for several days, of difficulty of breath- ing and swallowing, attended with a sensation of heat of the fauces, when she was received into the hospital at Padua. Whilst there, she was seized with so violent a paroxysm of dyspnoea that she had nearly been destroyed by it. She recovered from the attack, .but it was followed by the spitting of fetid and bloody pus. She pointed to the larynx as the seat of disease, and by drawing it forwards with her fingers she could respire more freely. The aperture of the fauces appeared more ex- panded, and of a redder hue than usual. Respira- tion became more difficult, and she yielded to a fatal destiny about the beginning of September 1725, fifteen days after the first appearance of purulent sputum. Dissection. At the posterior part of the trachea, and about the distance of a finger’s breadth below the cricoid cartilage, a tumour had grown to the size of half a walnut. It in some degree compressed the oesophagus, but more particularly the trachea, so that the caliber of this pipe was narrowed to an oblong fissure. The cavity of the tumour was Some cases of this description will be adduced when speaking on the subject of impeded deglutition. Morgagni has mentioned serous depositions from inflammation as a cause of dyspnoea, but he does not appear to have distinguished the effusion of coagu- lable lymph as in cases of cynanche trachealis.—Ed.

481 intestines, especially those of them nearest to the anus, were distended with faeces. The stomach was exceedingly capacious though nearly empty; and about a pint of serous fluid, which resembled turbid bloody water, had been effused into the abdomen. This fluid was of so acrid a quality that it induced a burning sensation in the extremities of the fingers. The pericardium was greatly distended with a fluid similar to that reported to have occupied the abdomen; and beneath it, some black and firmly coagulated blood covered the surface of the heart. These parts and the genital organs were brought to me, but neither the heart nor the trunk of the aorta appeared to be dilated. However, on cutting into this vessel I found that, at the left extremity of the arch morbid appearances could be distinctly perceived, and onward to the heart they were still more strongly marked. In some places there were opaque spots which denoted subsequent ossification; in others we observed the commencement of small foramina, and likewise parallel longitudinal furrows. The semilunar valves were contracted, and, at the space of half a digit from them, there existed an orifice in the parietes of the artery sufficient to receive the extremity of a thumb; and this foramen communicated with a roundish aneurism which was appended to the artery in the form of a sacculus. It was the size of a large walnut, and was so situated at the posterior part of the aorta, as to have obstructed the functions of the left auricle or of the contiguous sinus. It had been ruptured in its upper part, and blood had i i

218 Case 6. Fracture and depression, with counter-fissure. Fite relicks also of a former removal of hone. A man fifty years of age, was struck with a stone about the middle of the left eyebrow, where the supraorbital nerve emerges from the orbit. After many hours had elapsed he was brought into the hospital, where it was requisite to confine him in bed on account of his violent convulsive agitation. The eyelids were closed, and his mental faculties annihilated; and he died thirty-six hours from the time of receiving the injury. During the last hour of life there was a cessation of convulsion. Dissection. The cranium above the orbit was broken into numerous fragments, and an acute splinter had irritated the dura mater, and produced inflammation in that membrane. On the opposite side of the head, a fissure was likewise discovered. A serous secretion was found in the cerebrum, which bore a slight resemblance to sanies. In con- sequence of some antecedent injury to the head, a portion of the cranium had been removed, and a thick membrane, to which the dura mater very closely adhered, was now substituted. Valsalva, li. 39. The possibility of counter-fissure has been a point of controversy; and though it does sometimes happen, it is a rare occurrence. It is probable that many of the cases which are recorded as examples of counter-fissure originated from the head having received a blow at opposite parts by the same accident, or from an extension of fracture to that

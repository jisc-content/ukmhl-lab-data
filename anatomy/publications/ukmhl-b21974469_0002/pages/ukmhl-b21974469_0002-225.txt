185 In cases of suppuration in the frontal sinuses, Palfin suggested that those cavities might be trephined. This operation indeed is not very desi- rable, but much greater inconveniences and even death have often resulted from an unarrested ozaena and the caries which has ensued from it. Where an ulcer of the nose was exterior to the sinuses, and yet its precise seat and extent uncertain, Valsalva injected fluids by a syringe, the head and upper parts of which were perforated. When the septum nasi was partially destroyed by ulceration, Valsalva resorted to internal as well as external remedies to check its progress. He also introduced thin tubuli into the nostrils, of such a shape and figure that the alae nasi might be sup- ported as far as possible.—Morgagni, xiv. 22. Excessive secretion from the Schneiderian membrane. From the mucous surface of the nose there is sometimes excessive secretion of a watery fluid. About the end of June 1745 I was consulted by a Venetian woman, who, from the time of being annoyed with coryza and an irritating discharge from the left nostril, in the preceding winter, conti- nued to be teased with a stillicidium, though at the time of her application the fluid was of an unacrimonious quality. Sometimes drops of pel- lucid water followed one another so rapidly as appearances, but I found the left antrum maxillare full of pus, and entertained no doubt that the pain attendant upon its formation had been the cause of the animal’s wildness. Palfin observed that intolerable pain was occasioned by suppuration in the pitui- tary sinuses.— Ed.

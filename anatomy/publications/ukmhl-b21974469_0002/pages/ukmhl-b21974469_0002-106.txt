66 of the jejunum was sprinkled with petechiae, the ilium was of a reddish colour, and in two places the coats were somewhat hard. One of these parts having been opened, exhibited an ulcer two digits wide and three in length, and this ulcer had de- stroyed the internal coat. The edge of the liver was black, the bile thick and turbid, the spleen large and flaccid, and the bladder distended with urine. Each cavity of the thorax, and the pericardium, contained some bloody serum. The heart was of an extremely loose texture. The brain was very soft; serum was deposited beneath the pia mater; and, in some places, there were bubbles of air under the same membrane. The ventricles contained a little bloody serum, and some vesicles filled with a pellucid fluid, were observed upon the choroid plexuses. The jaws were very firmly closed, whilst the other parts of the body were scarcely at all rigid : the upper lip was drawn to one side at the period of death. When the mouth was opened, an abscess was discovered in it as large as a walnut: the posterior parts of the mouth were livid, and when their soft parietes were cut into, they exhibited numerous cells,, distended with a fluid which pre- sented a gelatinous appearance.—Morgagni, iv. 26. With such flaccidity of the heart and brain it is not at all surprising that this man died suddenly. The morbid condition of the latter organ had been indicated by the stupor—by the insensibility to the stimulus of urine—to the pain arising from the ulcerated intestinum ilium—to that of the

497 lived three days, the latter, in whose aorta there was a large tubercle,* was taken off in nineteen hours.—Morgagni, xxvi. 39. Case 2. Rupture of blood vessels in the parietes of the thorax, without external wound. A man was kicked on the thorax by a horse. No external mark of injury was manifest, but the man experienced extreme difficulty of breathing, which neither bleeding nor any other measures were adequate to subdue. He died on the fifteenth day. Dissection. No rib was fractured, but a large quantity of blood was extravasated between the ribs and the costal pleura, by which a considerable tumour was occasioned, and the lung corresponding with this tumefaction of the parietes had sustained some lesion.—Morgagni, liii. 32. Death has often resulted from injuries of the thorax independent of any external wound. External aneurisms. Some cases of popliteal aneurism were cured by Valsalva on the plan by which he treated internal aneurisms, namely, bleeding and slender diet. Morgagni, 1. 10. Case 1. Inguinal aneurism; the posterior crural nerve ulcerated. A man forty years of age had a small pulsating tumour which arose gradually about the right groin. * See page 436. K k

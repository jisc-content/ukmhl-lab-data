47 bed earlier than usual; two hours afterwards his wife found him not only dead but cold, and lying in the position in which he laid himself down to sleep. This happened on the day after the death of Tita, of whom some particulars have been related. Dissection. The body was examined the next day. As soon as the scalp was divided, a consi- derable quantity of blood poured from its vessels. There was no appearance of extravasated blood within the cranium. The ventricles contained a small quantity of limpid fluid, but the substance of the cerebrum and of the cerebellum was perfectly natural. All the vessels, however, in the mem- branes and in the substance of the cerebrum were turgid with fluid blood to a degree that exceeded every thing of the kind which I had previously observed; some vessels scarcely discernible at other times, were greatly distended. The pericardium contained a small quantity of bloody serum ; the heart was large, and its vessels and auricles were distended with blood; the right valvula mitralis, and some of the semilunar valves, were opaque, and indurated; and on the centre of the posterior surface of the heart a small white membrane protruded, which appeared to be the vestige of a ruptured hydatid.—Morgagni, iii. 26. This man being plethoric, and retiring to rest with a loaded stomach, would have the aorta compressed, and respiration would be impeded. By these means a large quantity of blood accumu- lated in the head, and proved fatal.—27.

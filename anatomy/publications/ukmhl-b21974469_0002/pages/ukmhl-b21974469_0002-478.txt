The spleen was unusually soft in its texture; but its coats were thickened in some places, having a ramified appearance of structure, of a tendinous firmness, and apparently of an intermediate nature between cartilage and ligament. The mesenteric glands were enlarged.*—Morgagni, xxiv. 18. Case 2. A man died in the latter end of June 1689. On examination the aorta was found to be ulcerated and ruptured near the heart, so that the pericardium was filled with coagulated blood. There was no dilatation of the artery.— Valsalva, xxvi. 7. In other cases of rupture of the aorta which will be adduced, as well as in the one which has just been related, the parietes had been destroyed by ulceration. In the following case the aorta was ulcerated as well as ossified, to a considerable extent. Case 3. An old country woman of a diminutive stature, and excessively thin, was said to have died of old age, after two days indisposition.

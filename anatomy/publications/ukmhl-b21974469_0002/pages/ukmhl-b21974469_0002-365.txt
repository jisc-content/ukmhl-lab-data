325 in the middle of the thorax, and discharged a large quantity of limpid water from the fauces.—21. Although, even when calculi are expectorated, the patients more frequently die than recover, either because the concretions are not all ejected, or on account of others forming, or from the circumstance that the lungs had undergone irrecoverable disor- ganization; yet examples are not wanting of persons having not only lived a long time after expectorating these substances, but also of their having enjoyed good health without the aid of medicine. Asthmatic symptoms have sometimes ceased after calculi have been expectorated. Zacutus and Wedelius relate instances of restoration to health, after sharp and rough calculi had been expelled from the lungs. One of them resembled the bone of the finger; others were smaller, but had acute angles. Though several authors mention the appearance of these concretions in such diseases as phthisis, cough, dyspnoea, haemoptoe, asthma, and hectic fever, they do not specify the existence of pain; so that it would appear, from their obser- vations, that no great degree of pain was expe- rienced.—22. These concretions being soft in the beginning, assume the form of the part or tube in which they are seated. The haemorrhage resulting from them occasionally is so profuse as to destroy life.—23. I shall subjoin one history of a calcarious lung, from that distinguished anatomist Malpighi. A woman who was greatly emaciated was occasionally annoyed with cough, and difficulty of breathing ; but these affections never were accom- panied with expectoration of thick matter. The

59 Case 7. Apoplexy from deposition of serum; the brainflaccid; the vertebral artery ossified; and the blood fluid. A man, about seventy years of age, of pallid countenance, had dulness of hearing, and was occasionally attacked with vertigo and a disposi- tion to syncope. He had likewise some tremor, which was attributed to his having been for many years accustomed to manipulations with quick- silver ; and also a large scrotal hernia on the right side. He had been walking with a friend, appa- rently well and cheerful, but they had scarcely separated an hour and a half when he was found dead in the road. Dissection. The body was inspected twenty- four hours after death. The upper limbs were rigid; the mouth was distorted by being drawn to the right side, and on this part there was an appearance of ecchymosis, but whether it arose from a contusion received at the time he fell, or merely from the blood having accumulated there after death, I could not determine, for the blood throughout the body was in a fluid state. The cerebrum was flaccid and discoloured ; beneath the dura mater there was a considerable quantity of serum, and a smaller quantity in the ventricles; upon the choroid plexuses there were some turgid vesicles; and in the coats of the vertebral artery there were small laminae, some of a tendinous, some of a cartilaginous, and others nearly of a bony structure.â€” Valsalva, iv. 11.

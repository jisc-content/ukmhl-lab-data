459 Dissection. The face of the corpse was tumid and of a dark colour; the preputium and glans penis were swollen and livid, and exhaled an odour which indicated an approach to gangrene. The liver and spleen were indurated, and the latter was somewhat enlarged. On the exterior part of the thorax, between the right axilla and the sternum a tumour existed which was of a hemispherical figure, though somewhat depressed. It extended from the fourth rib to the clavicle, and yielded to pressure, so as to indicate that scarcely any bones or cartilages remained. The clavicle was displaced and carious, and the portions of the four upper ribs, which usually are cartilaginous, were destroyed. This destruction had been effected by an aneurism larger than the head of a kid: its figure was nearly oval, and it extended from the base of the heart to the upper part of the thorax. The aneurism resembled a sac, the left side of which communicated with the right side of the aorta, before it gave off the arteria innominata, by a foramen large enough to admit two fingers. The sac appeared to be formed by a production of the parietes of the aorta ; but in the aneurism these parietes were of whiter colour, more tenacious and dense, and not thinner than the coats of the artery. The sac was invested by numerous curved laminae of a fibrous texture; and within this circumference so large a quantity of grumous blood was contained, that when it was removed from the sac, with the lamellar concre- tions, it weighed forty ounces. The aneurism, by its bulk, had pressed the right lung backwards and

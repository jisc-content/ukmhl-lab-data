298 the fourth day he voided some bilious dejections. On the eighth day, after very copious urinary excretion, this disease terminated in death. Dissection. The right cavity of the thorax con- tained a serous fluid, which was turbid and sanious. Both lungs adhered to the diaphragm, as well as almost universally to the other parietes of the chest. The anterior part of the left lung was united to the pleura merely by filaments ; but the adhesion in other parts was effected by the inter- position of an adventitious membrane, of a white colour, and of a tenacious quality: and in some places, on the right side, it was scarcely less than half the thickness of the ring finger; but on the left it was materially thinner. When this concre- tion was separated from the lungs, which was readily done, the coats of those viscera presented a healthy aspect: but the costal pleura on the right side was somewhat opaque; and that part of it which covers the triangularis muscle of the thorax, was in a state of sphacelation, and lacerable by the slightest touch of the finger. The contiguous muscle, and the adjacent fleshy portion of the diaphragm on each side, extending to the centre of this septum, in those parts to which the lungs had been adherent, presented traces of inflammatory lesion. The left lung contained a portion of calcarious matter, and in other parts the texture of this viscus was indurated, dense, and heavy; but in all these respects the opposite lung had under- gone a much greater degree of disorganization. The pericardium contained a little more fluid than is usually found in this bag.

88 Case 3. Paralysis from ulceration of the brain; the left corpus striatum detached. A sexagenarian, harrassed with diarrhaea, accom- panied with tormina, and constant watchfulness, was seized in the following night with hemiplegia of the right side, without any previous complaint of the head. The first day, however, after bleeding, and the use of irritating applications to the soles of the feet, he could move his hand and foot a little; but the day afterwards he had not the least control over them. His right eye was half closed; his cheeks were florid; he could scarcely articulate— when he did speak it was with stammering. He gave sufficient evidence by signs that his mental faculties were unimpaired. At the commencement of the attack he respired with freedom, but respi- ration became difficult a day or two before death, which happened at the beginning of the fourth day. Dissection. As soon as the cerebrum was re- moved from the cranium, but especially when the infundibulum was divided from the pituitary gland, limpid serum and fluid blood burst forth. On the left side a quantity of serous fluid was deposited along the course of the vessels which presented the appearance of jelly. In two places beneath the pia mater the substance of the cerebrum appeared to be in a state of ulceration, but this was more manifest in the corresponding ventricle, for here the corpus striatum was found to be entirely separated from the rest of the cerebral substance by the ulcerative process.— Valsalva, xi. 25*

491 absorbed as much as the vertebrae, and in others, as in the preceding instances, they remain unin- jured. The reason of this difference is not very obvious.—30. The lamellated concretions which often form in aneurisms, especially those connected with the artery like a sac, and adhere to all its sides, are very different from concretions in the heart, or blood coagulated out of the body. They do not form, however, in all aneurisms, even where cir- cumstances, by retarding the motion of the blood, appear favourable to their formation. In an aneurismal sac, the blood is almost stationary, and at the latter period of the disease, the body is generally preserved quiescent, to guard against syncope and suffocation; and if no * concretions formed previous to death, I should suppose there existed some latent cause which would prevent the coagulation of the blood afterwards. Morgagni, xvii. 29. Valsalva found aneurism of the aorta a much more common occurrence than he expected, and therefore was solicitous to adopt measures to coun- teract it in the beginning. With a view to cure internal varices of veins Hippocrates said “ conducit “ aatem, lalibus, si ab initio curandos suscipies, ui et “ vence de manibus sanguinem emittant, et diceta e qua “ quam siccissimus et exanguissimus fiat” and in rela- tion to the advantage of this practice he subjoins “ si curentur incipiente morbo, rursus in Loco vence “ considunt ad latus, humilesque fiunt.” Albertini, the companion of Valsalva’s studies, adopted this practice in cases of internal varices of veins with

428 heart itself, or from the affections of other organs contiguous to it, or situated remotely. In many of the preceding dissections these circumstances have been elucidated, but it will be proper to add some which have not yet been spoken of distinctly. Palpitation sometimes arises from the influence of the mind, exerted through the medium of the nervous system, as happens to persons in health under the dominion of certain passions: and the same effect may be produced from other causes acting upon the brain, irrespective of mental agency. It may sometimes be excited by causes applied to the nerves, without apparent injury being immediately inflicted upon the brain. It has arisen from a disease in the foot: and those pal- pitations which occur in hypochondriacal and hysterical patients, are also ascribable, wholly or in part, to disordered action excited through nerves which communicate with the vessels or with the heart. The nervous system, in these persons, is too highly susceptible of sudden and irregular action, of several albuminous laminae. Blood was effused into the pos- terior part of this cavity, and an irregular rupture was perceived when the laminae were removed from the heart, an inch and half long. It was evidently of recent date; but on its left side, to the extent of five or six lines, the substance of the heart was destroyed, and replaced by a fibrous concretion, like that in aneurismal sacs. The ventricle was extenuated in this part, but thickened every where else. It is remarkable that the rupture took place not in the point of the old lesion, but in its vicinity. There is no doubt that the loss of substance in the heart was of very old date.—Nouveau Journal de Med. Avril, 18*20. Union between the ruptured part of the heart and the pericar- dium, by adhesive inflammation, may conduce to a protraction of life on these occasions.—Ed.

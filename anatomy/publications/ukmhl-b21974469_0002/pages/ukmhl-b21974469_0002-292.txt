252 Diseases of the abdominal viscera, especially in the liver and stomach, are a fruitful source of this affection. Those viscera which are contiguous to the diaphragm, as the liver and stomach, may produce it, through the medium of that septum, by mere contact, or in consequence of the peritoneum being implicated in the visceral disease; because this membrane is common to the viscera and to the lower surface of the diaphragm : or the lungs may be sympathetically affected through the medium of the nerves. In a case of tumour, a pound in weight, annexed to the stomach, dry cough, difficulty of breathing, and continual pain in the head, with watchfulness and loss of appetite, had been the prominent symptoms.

In some instances this consolidation, and adhesion of the pulmonary to the costal pleura, were the only morbid appearances discovered after death. Of the following cases, those first adduced will elucidate this result of inflammation; afterwards those will be successively

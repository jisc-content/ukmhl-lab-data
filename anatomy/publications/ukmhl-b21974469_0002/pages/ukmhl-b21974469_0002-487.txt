447 tissue beneath the inner coat of the artery. This coat may occasionally be ulcerated where they exist, but usually it is spread over them, as it often is over the scales of bone both in the arteries and veins. In parts of the aorta which had become callous and yellow, Haller observed that there was a progression in the spots from softness to various degrees of hardness. In some it was of a pulta- ceous consistence, and in others coriaceous, in some cartilaginous, and in others bony. I have already mentioned instances in which there had been a soft matter deposited between the coats of the arteries, and which, in some parts, had been advancing to a firm concretion by the absorption of the more fluid parts ; but, in many instances, I never could find any thing like fluid, nor any varia- tion of consistence.*—27. The aorta has sometimes exhibited a reticulated texture internally, as well as conversion into bone.—liii. 37. Various other cases of ossification and ulceration will arise when describing diseases with which they were complicated.f * See an interesting case by Jano Planco, page 434. f A cartilaginous or osseous induration of the aortic valves is perhaps the most frequent lesion to which the heart is liable; and it will at once be admitted that no disease of the arterial system can threaten more serious consequences. Sometimes the indu- ration commences in the corpus Arantii, and that body then proves a nucleus from which the ossification extends upon the floating edge of the valves ; but most frequently the deposition of osseous matter takes place at the base of the valves, between the two membraneous folds of which they are formed; but as accre- tion goes on, the lining membrane is absorbed, so that the

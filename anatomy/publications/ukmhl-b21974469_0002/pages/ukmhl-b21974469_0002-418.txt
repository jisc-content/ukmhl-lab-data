378 no such enlargement had taken place. If, for instance, either of the tricusped valves becomes contracted or inflexible, it will consequently be incapacitated to perform its functions; or if any of the chordae tendiniae are ulcerated, ruptured, or relaxed, and thus rendered inadequate to retain the valve in its situation, so as to close the orifice, some blood will return into the veins when the ventricle contracts. Certainly this symptom often indicates dilatation in the right cavities of the heart; but occasionally it denotes some other affection which either exists in those cavities, or, at least, maintains such a relation to them as to interfere with the transmission of blood through the right side of this organ.â€”9, 10. We must be careful not to be deceived by a kind of alternate turgescence of the veins, which cor- responds with a deep inspiration, or a forcible expiration. It will be easy to distinguish, however, whether the dilatation concurs with the frequency of respiration or of pulsation. We must likewise be careful not to confound the pulsation of veins with that of dilated carotid arteries ; and provided the vessels are prominent and tumid we shall experience no difficulty if we attend to the situa- tion, and to the softness of the parietes if it is a vein. We shall be assisted in the distinction by compres- sing the vessel; for should it be a vein, it will become turgid above the obstructed part, and will subside below it. We must also observe whether there may exist any other cause which does not involve organic disease in the heart, as is the case with chlorotic females* in whom, especially when

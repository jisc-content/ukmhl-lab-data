318 viscera had sustained various lesions of structure. Sometimes they were scirrhous; at other times they were found obstructed, or in some different morbid state ; and the stomach suffered more than the other viscera. This organ was inflated, and loaded with putrid and offensive saburrae.—44. The state of the thorax in the most extreme cases, may be elucidated by a reference to the appearance of the lungs in a man who speedily died from a violent attack of this nature. Those viscera were found so tumified that they completely filled the cavities of the thorax; and the lung on the side which had been painful, was inflamed, blackish, and stuffed with a white ichor like an abscess. The pleura was inflamed and livid, but diversified with some bloody points. The intercostal muscles having been highly inflamed, presented the appear- ance of a bruised part.—45. From these circumstances, and others noticed by authors who have written on this subject, it appears that the genuine indications of pleurisy have arisen from worms, not only when inflam- mation in the pleura had really been induced by that cause, but also when there was only a simu- lation of inflammatory action. It is, therefore, incumbent on physicians to be careful, especially in children, and others liable to worms, lest they mistake for the true disease, that which is sympa- thetic, and which, w hen arising from worms, will only yield to anthelmintic treatment.*—46. * That the respiratory functions should often be disturbed from abdominal disease cannot excite much surprise, when the association of their respective viscera is considered, as well as the

301 Case 7. A man about fifty years of age, whose thigh had been for many years the seat of a leprous affection, was attacked with quinsy, which continued for two days, and terminated in a pain of the back, to which were added dry cough, urgent thirst, inability to lie upon the right side, and an oppressive con- striction at the lower part of the thorax.

The left cavity of the thorax was full of a puriform serum; and, in consequence of concretion having taken place, a kind of mem- braneous expansion adhered to the pleura, and presented the appearance of ulceration in that membrane. When this stratum of lymph was removed, the pleura was found to be inflamed, and the lungs themselves had sustained a slight degree of similar lesion.*â€”Valsalva, xx. 56. * The puriform appearance of the serous deposition into the thorax, reminds me of a case, which was peculiarly interesting to myself in consequence of its having occurred in the person of an intimate friend.

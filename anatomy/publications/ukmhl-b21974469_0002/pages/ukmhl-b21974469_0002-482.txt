442 I have already said that numerous cases had occurred to my friends in which, after sudden death, no morbid appearances were discovered which would account for it, except disease in the aorta. Sanctorini entertained no doubt that osseous bracteae in this vessel were alone sufficient to destroy a man suddenly. He related to me six or seven instances, in which he could find nothing but these little bones to account for death. The most recent was the following case. Case 3. A Venetian tailor, devoted to hard drinking, but generally enjoying good health, had complained that he was not quite well; and soon afterwards, having eaten two little fish, and drunk some wine, he expired as he sat by the fire. The body was examined on the following day. Dissection. The lungs were not perfectly healthy, and in the pericardium there was an excess of serous fluid But it was evident that the man could not have died thus from either of these causes; and as the heart and other viscera betrayed no morbid appearances worthy of observation, the aorta was opened from the curvature to the loins, and exhibited numerous scales; which were also observed, to some height, in both the carotid arteries. The stomach was exceedingly capa- cious, as it usually is in drunkards. The caecum, to which there was no appendicula vermiformis, was contained in a hernial sac ; and the orifice of the sac was three or four inches broad. Morgagni, xxvi. 37.

87 Case 2. Paralysis after apoplexy from deposition of serum, ivith Jlaccidity of the heart. On one occasion there was admitted into the hospital of incurables at Bologna, an aged man, who, after apoplexy, was affected with hemiplegia of the whole right side of his body, and who was deprived of the sense of feeling as well as of the power of motion. He was afterwards attacked with fever and difficulty of breathing, though he neither perceived weight nor pain in the thorax. During the few last days of his life his pulse was weak, and the penis became gangrenous. Dissection. The intestines were turgid with gas. The left cavity of the thorax contained a small quantity of serous fluid, and the upper part of the right lobe of the lungs was of a purple colour, and of a hard and compact texture. I had not on any former occasion found the heart so flaccid as it was in this instance—when laid down it fell so flat as scarcely to equal a finger in thickness; and indeed all the muscles were exceedingly relaxed. As we cut into the cranium, a serous fluid escaped from it in no inconsiderable quantity, but some remained at the basis of the skull, in the spinal canal, and in the lateral ventricles: I supposed the larger quantity had been under the pia mater. On the left choroid plexus there were some vesicles turgid with fluid.—Morgagni, xi. 13.

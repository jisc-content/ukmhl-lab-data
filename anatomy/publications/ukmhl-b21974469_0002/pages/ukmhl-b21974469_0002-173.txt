133 that there was greater facility in discovering their minute parts; and I apprehend that the brains of maniacal persons are the most suitable for tracing the origin and course of nerves.â€”Morgagni, viii. 6. Case 4. Insanity from deposition of serum, induration of the cerebrum, and partial flaccidity of the cerebellum; with extrication of gas. A woman became the subject of mental derange- ment, in consequence of a man being killed to whom she was on the point of marriage. She continued in this state for nine years. Twelve months antecedent to death she underwent partu- rition, without any alteration in the state of her mind. Though wandering about the streets she was quite harmless. She died of pulmonary in- flammation in the beginning of December 1725. Dissection. The head only was examined. Serum was deposited beneath the pia mater, having some bubbles of air mixed with it; and similar bubbles were so crowded in some of the vessels of the cerebrum as to fill them. The medullary substance was of a brownish colour, probably owing to its vessels being unnaturally distended ; for this colour diminished at an increased distance from the cortical substance. The whole of this medul- lary substance was of unusual hardness, and the nerves were unnaturally firm and destitute of their usual degree of moisture. The cortical substance of the cerebellum was exceedingly soft, whilst the texture of the medullary substance of this part aijid of its pedunculi was firm like that of the cerebrum. Morgagni, viii. 9.

492 almost unexampled perseverance, and with great advantage; and the same result was found to be attainable in relation to the arteries, by the same means. In determining its utility Valsalva did not rely merely upon the cessation of pulsation, and the subsidence of the other symptoms which attend the early stage of aneurism. He also had an opportunity of observing in the body of a nobleman who had been cured of aneurism under this treatment, and who died of another disease, that the vessel in which aneurism had commenced, had contracted again to its natural diameter, though its coats, in that part, were somew hat callous. When Valsalva had withdrawn as much blood as was requisite, he ordered a progressive dimi- nution of food and drink till the quantity was reduced to a determined w eight of aliment and water. Having so enfeebled the patient that he could scarcely raise his hand from bed, on which he was ordered to lie from the beginning, the quantity of aliment was cautiously increased, till that degree of strength was regained which warranted the patient to rise from bed. Stancario succeeded in curing a young nun in the same manner. On the first days, after she rose from bed, the pulsation returned, but it did not continue, and, at length, entirely ceased. It will not, in general, recur, unless the patient refuses to confine himself to a temperate system of diet.— 30. There are many persons, however, to whom Valsalva’s method of cure may appear more into- lerable than the aneurism itself, especially at the only time when any treatment could avail. The

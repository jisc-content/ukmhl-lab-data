77 very unequal, for the trunk and thighs were fat, whilst the feet and legs, and particularly the upper limbs, were exceedingly slender. Thirteen hours had elapsed since death, and the season was very cold, being near the close of the year 1740, yet the abdominal viscera retained a considerable degree of warmth. The omentum was drawn up to the stomach; the stomach was small, but the intestines were inflated. The bladder was so distended as to ascend six digits above the pubis; the internal coat of this viscus exhibited, here and there, some bloody points; the vessels about the upper orifice of the urethra were so turgid that this canal appeared to have been inflamed, and was almost in a state of sphacelation. The gall-bladder was distended with bile, and contained several small and soft calculi, and one which was hard and granulated. There were other unusual appearances, not the result of disease, but of malformation. The dia- phragm was perforated by two foramina instead of one, by which veins were transmitted from the abdomen into the thorax ; they were contiguous to each other, but quite distinct; through one of them the vena cava passed, and by the other one of the hepatic veins, which united with the cava a little above the diaphragm. There were twenty-six ribs, but the thirteenth on each side was so exceedingly small as scarcely to exceed two inches in length. There was also an additional vertebra, which might be associated either with the lumbar or dorsal, according as they were calculated.

246 the vessels, at least, which proceed from the base of this organ towards its apex, were manifestly enlarged from remora of blood. The uvula and velum palati were not diseased. The membrane of the tonsils was thickened by the deposition of a yellowish jelly-like serum, and the tonsils them- selves were swollen, especially the left; which also was indurated, and when squeezed, or cut into, pus was discharged from it. The cartilages and muscles of the larynx were in a healthy state; but the investing membrane of this part, and of the adjacent portion of the trachea, was of a red colour and slightly thickened. Where the membrane covered both surfaces of the epiglottis, it had in some places a florid hue, and in others it was brownish and tumid. On cutting into it, the colour and tumefaction were discovered to have arisen from blood and serum, wdth which the membrane and the glandular bodies connected with it were distended. On the convex surface of this cartilage, suppuration had commenced. That portion of the membrane which descends at the posterior part of the larynx, and the glandular bodies which it envelops, had been the seat of high inflammatory action; and, on each side, the membrane was raised into a protuberance equal to the thickness of a manâ€™s little finger. These protuberances originated from the basis of the cricoid cartilage, and con- verging as they ascended, proceeded so far as some- what to exceed the heighth of the arytaenoid carti- lages, but were not connected with them. They consisted of the membrane with its glands, rendered turgid by the accumulation of blood and serum: the

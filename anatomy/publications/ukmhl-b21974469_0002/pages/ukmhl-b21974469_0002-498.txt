458 frequently discovered in the pulmonary artery than in the aorta, though it appears to be no more capable of resisting the action of the right ventricle than the aorta is adequate to sustain that of the left. This comparative infrequency must be referred to the position of the artery.â€”Morgagni, xviii. 24. Case 3. Aneurism of the aorta, occasioning the absorption of the ribs. The subject of this case was a native of Beluna, about fifty years of age, who was a shearer of woollen cloth, and who had been affected with the venereal disease. About a year before I saw him, he began to perceive a tumour in the right and upper part of the chest, and when I did see him he complained of great difficulty of respiration whenever he walked or spoke; but it did not attack him by paroxysms, nor had he either a sense of suffocation, or sudden interruption of sleep. He was only able to eat and drink sparingly, though previously he had been greatly addicted to excess in drinking. His face was tumid, and of a brownish red complexion; his voice obscure and hoarse; the sputum thick; the tumour was occa- sionally observed to pulsate: indeed, before the last twenty days, the pulsation was evident at a distance. The early part of the night, in which he died, he had passed as usual, amongst his fellow servants, and retired to bed saying that he should soon fall asleep, but he was found, shortly after- wards, breathing with stertor, and foaming at the mouth; and in about four hours he expired.

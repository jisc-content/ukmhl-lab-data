53 Case 2. Apoplexy from deposition of serum, with Jlaccidity of the heart9 and ossification of the aorta. A lawyer at Bologna, about sixty years of age, whose countenance was florid, inclining to a leaden hue, had complained for a month, of pain or a sensation of weakness in the region of the stomach, by which his strength had been greatly diminished, so that, when taking exercise on foot, he was frequently compelled to rest.

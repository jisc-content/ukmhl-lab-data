437 Excrescence and ulceration of the aortic valves. Case 1. A miller’s servant, thirty-six years of age, became diseased, and died under circumstances which seemed to indicate hydrothorax. His legs were cedematous, and the pulse was extremely weak. He had virulent gonorrhoea at the time. Dissection. There had been effusion of fluid, not only into the thorax, but also into the abdomen; and the viscera in both these cavities were inflamed. The lungs were dense. The aortic valves were occupied by short and irregular excrescences, and were so approximated as to leave a very narrow orifice for the transmission of blood. When exa- mining them individually with more attention, I found that the border of the right valve was shorter than usual, and that the left was ruptured, through the middle, from the border to the base ; and from the lips of the ruptured valve other excrescences sprouted. Although the general texture of these valves was more flaccid than natural, yet, when they were rubbed between the fingers, some parti- cles like cartilage could be perceived. This disease had originated in ulceration, and the internal surface of the contiguous ventricle participated in it. The borders of the mitral valves, in places, were somewhat thickened and indurated. The large intestines were inflamed and fetid, and the liver was enlarged and pale; and on its from cheese to common pus. The accumulation of curdy matter has sometimes been so great as to obliterate the cavity of an artery. Calcarious matter is occasionally deposited in the centre of these eminences.—Ed.

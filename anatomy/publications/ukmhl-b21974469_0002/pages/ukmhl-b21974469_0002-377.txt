The pancreas was thickened, and somewhat indurated. The right lung was closely united to the ribs and diaphragm in every part; but the left in a few places only. On the contrary, the substance of the right lung was healthy, whilst the greater part of the left viscus was diseased. A suppurating tubercle was situated in the upper lobe, and the inferior lobe was red, indurated, and dense in its texture; and its upper part contained pus, or matter like pus. The pleura was inflamed, and easily drawn away from the ribs. The tendinous centre of the diaphragm was inflamed, so that its minuter vessels were conspicuous. The pericardium contained some turbid and bloody serum. The vessels in the membranes of the brain were exceedingly turgid with blood ; the pia mater was generally red from its injected vessels ; and serum was effused beneath it, in the convolutions of the brain. The lateral ventricles contained a small quantity of bloody serum, and there were nume- rous and not very small hydatids on the posterior surface of the choroid plexuses.

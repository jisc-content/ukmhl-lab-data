41 trace of the corpus striatum could be found. The seat of this body was occupied by a substance, the colour of which was a mixture of red and yellow; it was in a state of suppuration, but had no offensive- ness of odour. The cavity of both ventricles was di- lated, and the septum lucidum was broken through; there was no vestige of the fornix, and scarcely any of the choroid plexuses. The coats of the left ver- tebral artery, before that vessel inosculates with the opposite to form the basilary artery, were somewhat thickened and opaque.

The texture of the heart was extremely flaccid; the coronary vein was dilated; the parietes of the pulmonary artery and its valves were thin; the left auricle of the heart was expanded much beyond its usual capacity; the lower edge of one of the mitral valves was thickened to an extreme degree; bony concretions were formed upon the corpora sesa- moidea of the semilunar valves; and in several places the aorta was ossified.—Morgagni, lx. 4. The blood in this case appears to have been ex- travasated from rupture of the vessels in the choroid plexuses, or of other vessels within the ventricles ; and the greater part had probably flowed from the right side.—5. Case 16. Apoplexy from extravasation into the cerebrum, with distortion of the spine. A beggar, about fifty years of age, having a curved spine, was seized with apoplexy; his right limbs were paralytic, and his mouth was distorted. He was immediately received into the hospital, where

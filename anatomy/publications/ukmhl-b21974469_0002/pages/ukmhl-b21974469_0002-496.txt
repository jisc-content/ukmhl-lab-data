In a large aneurism of the thoracic aorta, beginning about three digits above the heart, Ruysch has mentioned that for some time before death, the pulsation was obscured from the quantity of laminae of coagulated blood.â€”20. The following case coincides with the preceding in the nature and seat of the aneurism, and the uneasiness occasioned by deglutition ; but here the arteria innominata was involved in the dilatation. Case 2. Aneurism of the aorta a?id arteria innominata. A trumpeter at Padua had been affected with an aneurism of the aorta which occupied the upper part of the chest, long before I saw him, which was, I think, about the year 1723. In proportion as the expansion of the artery increased, the uneasiness in deglutition, and the difficulty of breathing, were augmented, till at length he became entirely incapable of swallowing, and afterwards of breathing. Dissection. I found the arch of the aorta, with the arteria innominata, so dilated, that the aneurism had compressed the trachea and cesophagus. Its inner surface was occupied by a thick laminated concretion, which I had observed in other instances, Its curved laminae could be separated from each other like those of an onion: it was hard, of a yellowish white colour, and bore a stronger resemblance to hardened suet than to

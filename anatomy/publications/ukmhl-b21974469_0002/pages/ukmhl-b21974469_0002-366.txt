326 symptoms underwent no alteration by her lying on the back or on either side; but she respired most freely when the neck was elevated. She expe- rienced a sense of weight, as if something were hanging from the fauces into the thorax, and con- stringing the fauces. Malpighi conjectured that the lungs were tartarized. When she died, and the thorax was opened, the accuracy of his diagnosis was confirmed by the crashing of the knife, as if sandy concretions were cut into, and was still further corroborated in the progress of the dissection,—Morgagni, xv. 25. In a man who had been affected with a tumour in the neck, which ultimately proved fatal, several parts of the lungs were filled with globules of an earthy concretion; and these organs were univer- sally pervaded with a great redundance of serum.* Valsalva, xvii. 19. * Dr. Johnson has related an instance in which an abscess formed in the lungs produced caries of the ribs, and afterwards burst outwardly. The right lung was converted into a mass of calcarious matter, cartilage, and a solid substance like indurated liver.—Med. Chir. Journal, March, 1817. Dr. Marcet, in his Work on Calculi, has mentioned the existence of a white incrustation of a triple phosphat on the surface of one of the lungs. A case recently occurred to me in which a concretion, the size of a french bean, had formed in the lung; and the external portion of the viscus, corresponding with the earthy body, exhibited precisely the appearances of a cicatrix. It is well known that hydatids form in the pulmonary tissue. In a case, the symptoms attending which had been those of phthisis, M. Prost found two cysts, one of which was the size of a pullet’s egg, and its parietes were partly cartilaginous and partly ossified. Ossification of the cartilages of the larynx and air-tubes is not a veuy unfrequent occurrence.—Ed.

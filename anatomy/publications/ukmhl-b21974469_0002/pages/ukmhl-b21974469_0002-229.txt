This event, however, generally hap- pens to plethoric persons. By what means the Schneiderian membrane, when irritated, can draw the diaphragm into sym- pathetic action, and excite violent sternutation, has been occasion of surprise to many distinguished men: and an argument has been deduced from this well-known sympathy against those who elucidate the consent of parts by a reference to nervous communications.

243 As this woman had neither wandering of intel- lect nor lethargy, it is probable that the vessels had been accustomed to distension; and perhaps the functions of the respiratory organs were more dis- turbed than those of other viscera, in consequence of there being greater turgidity of the vessels at the origin of the nerves which are subservient to that process. Cases have frequently occurred in which there was pain and spasm in some distant part; but the seat of disease was proved by examination to be in the brain, though there had been no indication of it during life. The parts which had been painful and convulsed, though subjected to careful examination, did not exhibit any trace of disease. In cases of wound, tetanic spasms are often premised by a pain in the pharynx; but it is unquestionable that the cause of the pain and convulsion was not in the pharynx, but in the wound. Therefore, although when respiration becomes difficult from an affection of the nerves, the source is distinguished with greater facility if the patient complains of the head, whilst the symptoms of other causes are absent, yet it sometimes happens that the disorder arises from an encephalic lesion, without any inti- mation whatever.—9. But respiration may be disturbed by acute pain in any part of the body, through the influence of nerves, when it may not be ascribable to irritation in the brain. Through the same medium the pulmo- nary action is disordered in hypochondriasis and hysteria; and orthopncea arising from renal calculi has been accounted for in the same manner.—10. R 2

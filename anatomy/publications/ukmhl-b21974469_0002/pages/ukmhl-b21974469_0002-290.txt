250 filled with putrid matter. Its parietes internally were hard, and externally were constituted of yellowish granules like millet seed. Two conti- guous glands, each as large as a pea, presented a similarly granular appearance, from which circum- stance it was inferred that the tumour had origi- nated from a gland like them. Morgagni, xv. 15. Dislocation of the cartilages of the larynx, and of the os hyoides. In a case of impediment to deglutition, an attempt was made to account for the phenomena by attributing them to spasm of the hyoidei muscles ; but the history is not given with adequate precision, because the muscles in this part are numerous, and perform offices directly opposed to each other. Not only may the os hyoides and larynx occasion the difficulty alluded to, but like- wise those parts which are connected with them, if considerably diseased. Valsalva has related a case in which this occurred from luxation of the superior appendages to that bone; and Boerhaave, on the authority of Cowper, reported an instance of similar obstruction from the luxation of the car- tilages of the larynx, which I suppose was the displacement of the thyroid from the cricoid.* Morgagni, xxviii. 14. * Morgagni has exclusively associated these cases with impeded deglutition, but they are equally injurious to respiration. I am sanctioned in this opinion by the following instance of luxation of the os hyoides. A few years ago a respectable and intelligent dissenting minister, not enjoying good health, was seized, whilst

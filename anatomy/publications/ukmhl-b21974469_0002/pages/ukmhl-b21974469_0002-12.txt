IV facts, all sound reasoning and solid improve- ment in medical science must be founded. A deep conviction of the importance of the subject induced me to undertake an abridge- ment of Morgagni's vol uminous work De Sedibiis et Causis Morborum, per anatomen Indagatis; and if, by rendering more accessible the valuable stores contained in this long-celebrated work, and by recording a few of my own dissections, I may be the means of diffusing that knowledge by which disease may be better understood, I shall be amply rewarded for my humble though rather arduous labour as an editor. Other anatomists preceded Morgagni in this path of research, and the Sepidchretum Anato- micum, by Theophilus Bonetus, claims priority of attention. Amidst numerous repetitions, and many vague and useless narrations, this work contains facts of great importance, and affords evidence of indefatigable industry. Many of the facts, also, which are related in Lieutaud's Historia Anatomico-Medica are ex- tremely valuable and interesting, but in the detail of symptoms it is exceedingly defective. I might add the celebrated names of Ruysch and Haller, both of whom have very accurately

364 Polypus of the heart. Concretions found in the heart have been com- pared by different anatomists to marrow, fat, and sometimes to flesh; and their appearance bears an accurate resemblance to these substances. But those who imagined that they really were of this nature were satisfied with a very superficial exami- nation of them, and were consequently deceived. Those, however, who were not under a deception, and who really saw that blood-vessels had extended into these substances, a circumstance which I have never seen, did not then meet with the polypi of which I now speak, but with excrescences of the heart. The principal and peculiar substance of these polypi is the same as the crust which often in which, although there was an abundance of fluid in both cavities, the larger quantity was on the left side, and the heart was compressed into a narrow space immediately beneath the sternum. A few years ago I visited a man in whom there was reason to believe the heart had been suddenly and violently displaced ; but as the body was not examined after death the case must be related with diffidence. He was an old man and had long been subject to troublesome cough; and, upon one occasion, when coughing with extreme violence, he said that he felt something “ crack” within him. He pointed to the region of the heart, and, on examination, no pulsation could be observed in the left side, but it was felt in epigastric. Some months had elapsed when I saw him. On the most attentive examination I could not detect the least impulse against the ribs, but in .the epigastric region, the action was very strong, distinct, and circumscribed; and in consequence of the man being exceedingly emaciated, something which in figure and solidity resembled the heart could be traced. The man lived at a distant part of the country, and I saw him only once ; but the circumstances appeared to me to indicate a displacement of the heart.—Ed.

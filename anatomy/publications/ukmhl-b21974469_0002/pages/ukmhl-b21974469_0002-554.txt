514 perceived with deep concern that the intermission was constantly increasing. I advised this gentle- man to apply his finger much less frequently to the pulse; and when he had followed my advice, the anxiety of his mind diminished, and the inter- mission soon became less observable, till, at length, not attending to it, the affection wholly ceased. I have likewise observed that not only the nerves distributed to the heart, but that those also which are subservient to the arteries, or their contiguous muscles, may vary the action of these arteries. The patient in whom I observed this circumstance had but just escaped the peril of a violent disease, when his mind was deeply distressed by the reception of unpleasant intelligence which had been communicated to him at this unseasonable moment, and his distress was aggravated by his efforts to disguise it. At a period when I had no reason to expect such an occurrence, I found the pulse in both wrists beating with every kind of irregularity, but on the following days the inequality was confined to the left arm. As the pulse was perfectly regular in the right arm, it was evident that the cause related only to the left brachial artery; and that vessel soon regained its natural action when the mental distress was alleviated, and the nerves returned to their proper functions.â€”20. The influence of the nerves in the production of inequality in the pulse has been elucidated by the celebrated Molinelli in the third volume of the Commentaries of the Institution of Sciences at Bologna. He tied the par vagum on one side of the neck of four dogs, and did not immediately

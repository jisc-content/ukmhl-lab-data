pulse, syncope, palpitation, nor any other indica- tion of disease in the heart, preceded death; and though I do not think, with Harvey, that the heart is insensible, yet its parietes may sometimes be affected with diseases which, by extension, per- forate the cavities, and life is lost without any premonitory symptoms.—25. Prolapsus of the heart. The heart may be displaced by a variety of causes, but to some of the reported cases I have objected. In the true prolapsus of the heart the diaphragm is sometimes so greatly depressed that it seems to embrace the heart in a kind of hood, as was observed in the Marquis de Palais by the physician of the French king. As the diaphragm and heart descend, the inconveniences arising from a compressed stomach, and the pulsations of the heart in the left hypochondrium are more or less observed. Therefore not only the patient, but the physician who does not attentively consider all the symptoms, may mistake a displacement of the heart, and its pulsations, for an affection of the stomach and the pulsations of the coeliac artery. It frequently happens from similar compression of the diaphragm, that they who are affected with hydrops pericardii complain of pain and a sensa- tion of oppressive weight in the region of the stomach. *—Morgagni, xvii. 28. * In some cases of malformation the heart has been found either wholly on the right side or verging towards it. It is often displaced by accumulations of pus or of serum in the left cavity of the chest. Recently, when examining a case of hydrothorax.

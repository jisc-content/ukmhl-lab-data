136 yellowish-red colour. The choroid plexuses were florid, the vessels were turgid in other parts of the brain as well as in the plexuses, and the coats of the arteries unusually firm. But the circumstance most worthy of notice was, that whilst the cortical substance of the cerebellum was exceedingly flaccid, and that of the cerebrum in a less degree, the medullary substance of the cerebellum and the tuberculum annulare was a little firmer than usual, and that of the cerebrum and of the beginning of the medulla spinalis was peculiarly hard. Morgagni, viii. 15. In one case of this nature the vessels were found distended, some fluid was deposited beneath the pia mater, and the general substance of the cere- brum was indurated, whilst some of the internal parts were extremely soft: amongst the latter were the fornix and the pineal gland.—12. The brain has been found indurated by other anatomists. In my dissections the pineal gland often appeared diseased; and in almost all the dissections I have made of persons whose intellec- tual faculties were deranged, the substance of the cerebrum and cerebellum was unnaturally firm. The membranes of the brain have been thickened, and the falciform process ossified, both in cases of insanity and idiotism. It has occurred to me frequently to find that there had been determina- tion of blood to the head, and more frequently deposition of serum beneath the membranes or in the ventricles. The spleen was probably often affected, and the liver and pancreas have also been found the seat of disorganization.—13, 14,

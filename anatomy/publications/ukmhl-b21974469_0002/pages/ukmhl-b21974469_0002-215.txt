175 swelling arose behind the external ear, from which, when the integuments were divided, a large quan- tity of pus was discharged. Some hours after the abscess had been opened the boy was seized with convulsions, and they recurred at intervals till his death. On the day that he was attacked with these irregular muscular actions, the divided integuments became painful, and a particular part of the incision was so exquisitely sensible that the slightest touch on that spot gave intolerable pain. The day follow- ing the boy was delirious, and almost destitute of pulse and strength. His delirium afterwards ceased, and he regained some vigour and cheerful- ness ; but he relapsed, and died the beginning of February 1740. Dissection. The lateral sinuses of the dura mater were full of blood, with which also the vessels of the pia mater were surcharged. There was a small redundance of serous fluid in the right lateral ventricle, and a much larger quantity in the left. The sella tursica was occupied by a purulent fluid, some of which had descended to the beginning of the medulla spinalis. The posterior surface of the petrous portion of the right temporal bone was carious, and it was in consequence of a perforation in that bony process that pus had been effused into the cranium. The membranes of the cere- bellum on the right side were ulcerated, and the corresponding part of the cerebellum itself to the depth of an inch was of a brown colour. The pus within the cranium had a greenish hue, but was not fetid. The heightened sensibility at a particular point in the incision appeared to have

Some of the glands of the choroid plexuses were equal in size to large lentils, and two coagula of blood were attached to the right plexus. On both sides of the cerebellum there was extravasated blood—on the left side about the quantity of an ounce, and that portion of the cere- bellum which was contiguous to it had a soft con- sistence, like rotten fruits.*— Valsalva, ii. 22.

It did not adhere much to the adnata in any part, but in the centre it was completely dis- joined from it, so that Vandelli passed a probe of moderate size between them with facility; but the extreme point was firmly connected with the cornea, and when the patient turned his eye to look at objects on one side of him the whole pterygium was rendered tense, and the lachrymal caruncle drawn forwards and elongated. Nearer to the basis, it was proportionably less changed from the natural appearance: in this part it was florid from the vessels distributed upon it, but the other parts of it were of a whitish colour. In consequence of the structure being opaque, a considerable portion of the rays of light were intercepted. The patient indeed was affected with a degree of nyctalopia, for he saw better when sur- rounded with a degree of gloom than when exposed to a clear light, consequently he saw more per- fectly in the evening than at noon.

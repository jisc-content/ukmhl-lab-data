368 Case 1. Aneurism of the right auricle; a vesicle on the kidney. A man sixty years of age, was seized with orthopncea; and such was the degree of oppression “ The first effect of this reaction” he says “ will be to cause the “ extension—the elongation of the fibres of the heart; the second “ to prolong the stay of the blood in the cavities of that organ, “ and consequently also to prolong the stay of its stimulus. “ Finally, the coronary arteries, as well as the capillaries of the “ heart, remaining in a permanent state of fulness, will supply “ more nourishing matter to the fleshy substance of this organ, “ whence arise, without doubt, the increase, at least in part, of “ its vital energy, and also the dilatation of its cavities; the elongation of its fibres, the thickening of their bands, the “ greater consistence of the parietes, and the more vigorous “ action of the organ. “ The same causes, acting daily and hourly, will tend more " and more to change the natural state of the heart, as well as “ that of the arteries which spring from it. These latter will yield “ with less facility, the dilating power acting less directly upon “ their parietes, which, moreover, can oppose a greater relative “ resistance, by reason of their own organization, and the support “ which they derive from the pressure and action of the sur- “ rounding parts. The heart on the contrary, free on all sides, “ formed of fibres, susceptible of great extension, and supported “ only by their own reciprocal union, will experience in its “ organization, a change which the same efforts will not produce “ upon the arteries. It is true, we sometimes see these vessels “ yield to the efforts of the blood propelled forward by the heart, “ which, itself, in some subjects, preserves its natural size, while “ the arch of the aorta, for example, undergoes a great dilatation; “ but, then, a peculiar and local weakness favours the dilatation “ of the vessel which becomes the seat of aneurism. “ The formation of aneurism of the first species, does not “ always depend upon the want of proportion between the caliber “ of the vessels, and the quantity of blood which the heart has “ to send through them. Every obstacle to the current of the

124 Dissection. One lobe of the lungs was some- what indurated. Having disunited the fifth and sixth vertebrae of the thorax, much serous fluid escaped from the spinal canal. The vessels of the pia mater, on the posterior part of the left hemi- sphere of the brain, were greatly distended with blood of a black colour; and there was a little serum beneath the same membrane resembling jelly, with some bubbles of air, though it did not appear from any unpleasant odour that decompo- sition had commenced, and being in the middle of March (1745) putrescence would scarcely have taken place in three days. The brain was indu- rated, and exhibited bloody points in the medullary structure, which soon spread into drops, indicating the existence of a large quantity of fluid blood. The lateral ventricles retained scarcely any fluid; the choroid plexuses were of a deep red colour; the pineal gland was of a rosy hue. The medulla spinalis being attentively examined from the cra- nium to the fifth dorsal vertebra, the vessels of its pia mater were so exceedingly turgid with blood, especially its posterior, surface, as to resemble an injected part; even the minute vessels of the spinal nerves participated in this turgescence. The ab- domen was not opened.â€”Morgagni, x. 17. Case 9. Convulsions from deposition of serum, and turgescence of vessels in the lateral ventricles, with abdominal disease. An old porter was brought into the hospital February 1, 1745. He was speechless; pulsation

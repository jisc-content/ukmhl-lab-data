300 often found after thoracic inflammation as some have supposed. Haller asserted that it never appeared to him that inflammation of the pleura alone had been destructive to life.* In the following instance, however, by contrast- ing the degree of lesion of the pleura with that of the lungs, it may be inferred that the man’s death should chiefly be attributed to inflammation of the membrane; and I do not recollect to have met with a parallel instance in the histories of Valsalva, or amongst those which have fallen more imme- diately beneath my own observation. Morgagni, xxi. 37. * At the close of the twentieth and twenty-first epistles, Morgagni has filled several long articles with an examination of conflicting testimonies respecting the frequency of inflammation in that portion of the pleura which invests the ribs, independent of inflammation in the substance of the lungs. We may summa- rily state, that, in numerous cases in which there had existed the symptoms usually recognised as diagnostic of pleuritis, the inflammation was seated in the substance or coats of the lungs; and when it might have originated in the costal pleura, the viscera were usually, though not uniformly, implicated in the disease. Morgagni, it will also be observed, had found the pleura inflamed when there had been no very acute symptoms. Portal entertained the opinion that there was no essential difference between pleurisy and peripneumony. He endeavours to show, as the result of his dissections, that the pulse, which is said to be hard in pleurisy and soft in peripneumony, and that the heavy pain and oppressed respiration of the latter, as well as the acute pain of the former, are all extremely uncertain. He suggests the probability that the pain of the side may sometimes arise from sympathy between the nerves of the lungs and the intercostal nerves.—Ed.

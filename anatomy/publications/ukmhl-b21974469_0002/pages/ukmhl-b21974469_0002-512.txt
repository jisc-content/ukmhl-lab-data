A middle-aged woman, who had been in the hospital at Padua before, on account of pain in the left division of the chest, presented herself again for admission, previous to the middle of January 1717. She complained of the same pain, and it was accompanied with considerable fever, and vibration of the pulse. The disease was evidently urgent, but the symptoms did not indicate such imminent danger as to induce a suspicion that a fatal termination was so near: nevertheless, she died suddenly on the following day. Dissection. When the thorax was opened, it appeared as if she had laboured under hydro- thorax ; but as a large quantity of coagulated blood was found below the serum, the nature of the case was clearly defined. Proceeding in our inquiry as to the source of the extravasated blood, a large and ruptured aneurism of the aorta discovered itself. From its origin this artery was wider than it is in its natural state, and its inner surface was uneven; but it was not manifestly dilated into an aneurism before it had sent off the subclavian artery. From this part the coats of the artery were not extended into a lateral sac, but the trunk expanded itself uniformly, so as to form a large and almost spheroi- dal cavity. At the lower part, the artery again contracted to its usual diameter. The aneurism on one side had compressed the upper portion of the left lung, and on the other it pressed upon the

271 pounds of limpid serum, and the right was filled with a more turbid fluid, in which portions of a membraniform concretion floated. There was no adhesion between the pleurae, but the whole of the right lung was greatly indurated from inflammation. The pericardium was exceedingly distended with fluid.— Valsalva, xx. 30. The circumstance that a portion of the lungs which is situated behind the liver had been the seat of inflammatory action, elucidated the decep- tion as to the organ affected, and also accounted for the sensation of heat in the back.—Morgagni, 31. Case 4. A girl sixteen years of age, was cachectic, and the menses had been suppressed for eight months. She had some catarrhal expectoration, and expe- rienced a degree of difficulty of respiration, with a sensation of heat and uneasiness in the thorax, on the left side. At length she was unexpectedly seized with a laborious orthopnoea, so that she could not assume the recumbent position. The sputum, which heretofore had been purely mucous, became bloody; and she felt an oppressive weight in the left side of the chest, having, at the same time, a hard pulse, and coldness of the extremities.

Both cavities of the thorax con- tained limpid serum; and after this fluid had been allowed to stand at rest, it exhibited a concretion in the middle, which was separate from the rest of the fluid, and resembled jelly. And when some of

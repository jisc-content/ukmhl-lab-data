Previous to the expulsion of the latter worm, which was six months before she came to Valsalva, she had suffered violent pain, extending from the ear to the adjacent temple and neighbouring part of the forehead, but was immediately relieved when the worm was thrown off with a quantity of pus. The worm resembled a small silkworm. On the same day, however, she was again attacked, at various inter- vals, with a similar but more violent pain. When seized she immediately fell down, and remained insensible till the pain subsided, a period of about two hours. Soon afterwards a third worm was expelled, which, though smaller, coincided in form with the preceding. The deafness of this ear re- mained, and was accompanied with some numbness and itching of the contiguous parts. Valsalva enter- tained no doubt that the tympanum was ulcerated. Those who have ulcers in the ear should never sleep in the daytime of summer or autumn, without having the orifice of the meatus closed, because flies are likely to be attracted, and will deposite their ova, which is the only means by which these maggots are propagated. They never originate from putrefaction. Worms may be removed by fluids injected into the tympanum, or by the smoke of proper substances conveyed thither from the mouth through the Eustachian trumpet.â€”xiv. 7.

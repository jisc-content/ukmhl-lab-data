Case 6. Pulmonary phthisis, with cartilaginous bladder. A man fifty years of age, having undergone excessive fatigue in travelling, complained of pain in his chest, and expectorated a large quantity of matter. He was most comfortable when lying with his head bent forwards. His feet and abdomen were tumid, he was very thirsty, his respiration was rather panting than breathing; and this function was peculiarly oppressed after he had taken food. To these symptoms haemoptysis was added. However, the spitting of blood ceased; and for nearly the space of a month he was wholly free from pain in the chest, though the other symptoms continued. During the three or four latter days of his life he was * There seems but little doubt that this was a case of true tuber- cular phthisis. Delusive amendments, and unexpected accessions of acute disease, are well known to occur frequently in this dreadful malady. It may be a form of disease which suddenly develops the pulmonary affection. But instances have occurred to me in which life had been terminated by affections in which the lungs scarcely appeared to be involved; when, on examination after death, these viscera were found to be extensively disorganized by strumous lesion. It has often appeared surprising that extensive structural disease should have taken place without being manifested by hectic fever or by any other marked symptoms.—Ed.

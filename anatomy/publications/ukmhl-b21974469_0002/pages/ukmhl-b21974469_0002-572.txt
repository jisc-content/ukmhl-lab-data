The abdomen contained but little serum, and all the viscera were in a healthy state except the spleen, which had become somewhat enlarged. The uterus was examined, to ascertain if there existed any rudiment of conception; and two vesicles, with a kind of unformed and unad- herent mucous mass, united with something like coagulated blood, were found within the cavity of that organ. One of the vesicles was about the size of a small lentil, and the other that of a small vetch. They were firmly adherent to the parietes of the uterus, but did not evince any vascularity; nor did the fluid they contained coagulate by heat. How ever, the ova, or vesicles of the ovaries, consisting of double membranes, not only exhibit blood-vessels, but the included humour is coagulable, and resembles albumen. This congelation of the fluid of the ovarian vesicles took place in the w oman w hose case is before us. The entrance of one of the Fallopian tubes into the uterus was obliterated. The lungs w ere unadherent to the costal pleura, but their texture w as hard. The thoracic cavities w ere so replete with serous fluid that it burst forth on dividing the sternum ; and about five ounces of a similar fluid w ere contained in the pericardium. There existed this difference, however, between the thoracic aud pericardiac liquors, that on being exposed to the action of heat, the former coagu- lated, but not the latter.â€” Valsalva, xvi. 2.

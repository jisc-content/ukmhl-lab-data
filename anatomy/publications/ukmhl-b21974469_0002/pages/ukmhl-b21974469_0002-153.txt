SECTION VIII. Spasmodic and Convulsive Diseases. Though convulsive affections must often be regarded as only forming a part of other diseases, or in its membranes. There was no uniformity as to the seat of this structural mischief. Out of eight cases, which the author states were not selected from others to establish any new theory, three presented morbid appearances at some part between the tenth and twelfth dorsal vertebrae; two between the sixth and eighth, and one of them also at the lumbar extremity of the chord; in two instances the disease was exclusively seated at this extremity. In the remaining case not only was there softening of structure of the lumbar extremity, but from the bulb of the brain through the whole extent of the spinal chord, hydatids of various sizes were observed. They were contained in the sac formed by the spinal membranes. Not only was the situation variable but also the injury itself. In the first the spinal marrow was softened and of a slightly brown colour: in the second, it was of unusual density: in the third—the meninges were injected, and the spinal marrow softened at its lower extremity: in the fourth—there was a point of suppuration in the posterior part of the left hemisphere of the brain; the arachnoid coat of the spinal marrow towards the tenth and twelfth dorsal vertebrae, presented a brownish appearance; and in the two corresponding points the medullary substance was softened: in the fifth—the arteries of the basis cranii were in several points cartilaginous and ossified; the parietes of the left ventricle of the heart were an inch in thickness, whilst the cavity itself measured but five or six lines; at the eleventh or twelfth dorsal vertebrae the sheath of the spine was brownish, and the medullary substance was softened: in the sixth—the whole ex- ternal surface of the spinal membrane was studded with osseous scales, of a dull white colour, and from one to two lines in dia- meter ; towards the seventh and eighth dorsal vertebrae, and at the lumbar extremity of the spinal marrow, the medullary sub- stance was softened: in the seventh—the hydatids existed as I

T3 In a man whose death happened from the rupture of a popliteal aneurism and the consequent effusion of blood, numerous bloody points appeared in the sections of the medullary substance, and were en- larged to drops when I made lateral pressure on the sections. The corpora striata of this patient, when cut into small pieces, exhibited no striae, but a continued medullary band.*—1. 55. * The importance of this observation is often verified in practice, and though, like the preceding, it does not relate to apoplexy, I have thought it might with propriety, be affixed to this sub-division of the present section. After uterine haemorrhage, and also after copious depletion on account of pulmonary and other inflammations, I have frequently observed the symptoms of cere- bral congestion—and which has generally appeared to arise from the excitement occasioned by some mental effort, though occasion- ally it has arisen without an evident cause. Whilst the other parts of the body appear comparatively bloodless, the vessels of the head throb violently ; there is severe pain; confusion of intellect, sometimes to such a degree as to threaten delirium; the pulse at the wrist is usually small and vibrating, and the countenance dis- tressed. When I first observed these symptoms I was led to abstract blood, from an apprehension of phrenitis; but I did harm: for if the urgency of symptoms was diminished, the sus- ceptibility to a recurrence was increased, and restoration to health was protracted. The liability to this form of cerebral plethora has appeared to me to be proportionate to the preceding haemorrhage, and the consequent debility. If in this condition an intrusive visitor be admitted to converse, though but for a short time, with the patient—or if the patient attempt to read, or in any other way to employ the mental faculties beyond what is perfectly easy—or if the mind be agitated, this state of the head will almost inevitably be induced. It may, however, be brought on by all those causes which tend to destroy the equili- brium of circulation; and none are more likely, in this con- dition of the patient, than noise in the room, deficiency of sleep, improper food, a constipated state of bowels, or a morbid state

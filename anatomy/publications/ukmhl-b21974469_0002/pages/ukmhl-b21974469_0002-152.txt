Whether epilepsy originates from induration of the cerebrum, from abscess, from lesion of a pecu- liar character, from turgescence of vessels, deposi- tion of fluid, or from any other cause, the cure is generally difficult—often beyond our reach; and when means are available, it will be manifest how greatly they must be diversified, to adapt them to the varied exigencies of disease primarily seated within the cranium, or derived from disease in some other part. The consideration too is urged upon us, how greatly it behoves medical practi- tioners to combine their efforts to elucidate this disorder; that by diligent observation, and by accurate dissection, each may fulfil his part towards an object so momentous*.—ix. 26. * Of late years much attention has been directed to the morbid condition of the medulla spinalis in this and in other diseases. In a considerable number of epileptic cases inspected by M. Esquirol, some part of the spinal cord was found to deviate from its natural appearance or texture, either in its medullary substance

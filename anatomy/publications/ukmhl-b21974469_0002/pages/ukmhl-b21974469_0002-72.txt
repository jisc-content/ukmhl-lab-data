32 # the abdomen. The colon was so small as to re- semble that of dogs; the vessels of the intestines were more turgid than usual; the spleen exhibited some bloody spots on its surface, and the gall bladder contained bile of a bloody appearance; there were some livid spots on the surface of the liver, but in other parts this viscus was unnaturally pale. On the side of the splenic artery there was an ossified hemispherical aneurism, full of coagu- lated blood. There was a small quantity of bloody fluid in the pericardium. When the calvarium was removed, extravasated blood was observed through the dura mater, which was found to cover the whole right hemisphere of the brain; the vessels of the pia mater, distributed over both hemispheres, were turgid with blood, and on the external part of the right hemisphere, there were two or three foramina from which the blood had issued. These foramina communicated with a longitudinal cavity in the medullary substance of that hemisphere, capable of receiving two fingers, and which was full of grumous blood; a small quantity of blood had reached the right ventricle, and some from it passed through a laceration of the septum lucidum into the left. From some other source, blood was extravasated beneath the tento- rium, which had diffused itself over the whole cerebellum; and, as far as we could see, a quantity of blood was extravasated upon the spinal marrow. If any considerable extravasation of blood takes place into the spinal canal, death will result from compression of the nerves which proceed from the medulla spinalis.â€”Morgagni, iii. 2.

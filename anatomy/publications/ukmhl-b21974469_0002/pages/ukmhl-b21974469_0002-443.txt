403 Case 20. Aneurism of the heart, and dilatation of the aorta and of other vessels; the aorta ruptured into the pericardium. A Venetian woman about thirty years of age, enjoying a good habit of body, laboured under occasional difficulty of breathing. She was the mother of several children, and ten years before had been seized with paralysis of the lower limbs, from which attack, however, she had recovered. Besides the difficulty of respiration, there existed a pulsating tumour in the neck, in the course of the right carotid artery, yet she never complained of any pain, or of numbness or tumefaction of the right arm. For four or five days before her death, she often complained of a sensation which, to use her own expression, excited an idea that the ribs had fallen towards the abdomen. In the middle of December 1708 she was seized with deliquium animi, her face, and particularly the lips became livid, and she died within a quarter of an hour. Dissection. The colour of some parts of the intestines and the pancreas indicated inflammation; and on examining the small intestines more atten- tively I found a part of them, to the extent of the palm of a hand, occupied by innumerable minute tuberosities which were nothing else than cells between the coats of these viscera, distended with extricated gas. The gall-bladder contained four or five calculi, which were found to be inflammable. When the abdominal viscera were removed, the diaphragm displayed a convexity downwards rather than upwards. d d 2

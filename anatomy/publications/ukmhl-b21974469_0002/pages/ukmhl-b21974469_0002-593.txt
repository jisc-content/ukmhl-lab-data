553 SECTION V. Wounds of The Thorax. Wounds of the diaphragm, and hernia through that septum. A blind man, seventy years of age, fell and struck the left side of his chest against a flint, with such violence as to fracture his ribs, and was received into the hospital of St. Mary de Vita. His pulse was hard, he had an oppressive and pricking pain in the wounded part, respiration was very difficult: and although this difficulty subsided a little on the fourth day, it became more violent again on the sixth, and was accompanied with delirium. He died on the ninth day. Dissection. The left cavity of the thorax was full of extravasated blood, and the true ribs of the corresponding side were all fractured. The seventh had wounded the diaphragm by its rugged extre- mity, and round the wound this muscle was universally inflamed.— Valsalva, liii. 5. The blood was effused from the lacerated inter- costal vessels. There is no mention of cough in this case, or of effusion into the abdomen. Pro- bably the situation of the wound in the fleshy fasciculi, which might not have been completely perforated, will reconcile the apparent discrepancy between this case and that related before.* To the wounded and inflamed state of the diaphragm, which is the principal agent in respiration, the very urgent dyspnoea must be referred. —6.

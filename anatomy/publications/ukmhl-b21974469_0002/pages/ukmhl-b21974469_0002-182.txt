142 In one dissection Mead discovered nothing more than a large quantity of green and viscid bile in the stomach, although he likewise examined the throat, brain, and thorax. The whole course of the oesophagus has been found in a contracted state. I apprehend, however, that we have not yet had a sufficient number of dissections to determine satisfactorily the seat of the disease : and I lament that from an uncontrollable fatality it has not been in my power to dissect one of these bodies. Either I have not been able to obtain permission, or have been prevented by illness or urgent engagements. Morgagni, viii. 20, 21. The first patient I saw at Bologna under this lamentable malady, was a boy who had been bitten in the cheek forty days before the disease com- menced. He w as furious and anxious; his face was florid ; he was extremely restless, but quite sensible, and therefore did not attempt to injure any one. Whenever water was offered to him, a sense of suffocation was produced. Death ensued within twenty-four hours. In another boy of this place the disease com- menced five months after he had been bitten in the leg. The cicatrix ulcerated. He was unexpectedly seized with anxiety, and soon afterwards a dread of wrater came on. In the morning his lips were black, and his pulse scarcely perceptible: at noon, about twenty hours from the attack, he expired. I shall subjoin two dissections, undertaken at my request by my friend Mediavia; and will add a third which was transmitted to me by Jaques de Machy from Rome.â€”22.

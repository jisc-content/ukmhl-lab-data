subject of apoplexy; from tlr^ appearance of the smaller cell I believed that she had. Morgagni, iii. 6. Many cases of apoplexy appear to maintain some analogy with cases of aneurism ; and not unfrequently they exist together. In such instances, it is probable that the coats of the cerebral vessels become dilated, ulcerated, or otherwise diseased, before they rupture.—8. It is not uncommon to find the coats of the vessels of the brain ossified, in old people—especially the carotids, where they make so great a flexure at the side of the sella tursica. In the case of an old woman, however, who died apoplectic from great extravasation; whilst almost all the other arteries, even the carotid, had bony lamellae in their parietes, the coats of the cerebral arteries were in a natural state.—lxii. 7. The cells remaining from previous attacks of apoplexy are often discovered. Brunnerus relates, that in the head of a woman who recovered from apoplexy, with which she had been attached five years before death, he found the remains of three small cells round the corpus striatum, which had become callous and had cicatrized. In another case of hemiplegia of the left side, in which I was consulted, the man died ten months afterwards, of diseased heart. The right hemisphere of the brain contained an abscess four digits in breadth, and one and a half in depth. The thalamus of the optic nerve on that side was less by two thirds than the left. J. W. Albrechtus found a cavity in the brain of a person whose cranium had been depressed

19 Chrome Hydrocephalus. Sometimes fluid has been deposited between the cranium and scalp, but neither Valsalva nor Mor- gagni had an opportunity of examining bodies in which such accumulations existed. Morgagni had seen the disease and cured it. t—xii. 1. Cases of chronic internal hydrocephalus have often been examined. In foetuses which Morgagni supposed to have perished from hydrocephalus, it appeared as if there had been no brain. The upper part of the head was exceedingly depressed; a thick membrane firmly adhered to the hairy scalp; there was no appearance of the upper part of the skull; no cerebrum, but merely a kind of bladder containing a yellowish fluid; disjoined from this bladder, which occupied the anterior parts in the basis of the cranium, a small substance was ob- served, not larger than the kernel of an almond, which, perhaps, represented the cerebellum. In other cases the fluid appeared to have entirely escaped.—xii. 6. The brain is not only extenuated and dissolved by the water, and the bones of the foetal cranium disunited, but the bones of the face and body are might be adduced, but I shall advert to none except the abuse of mercury as stated by Dr. Blackhall. It has been said, that the fluid in the heads of hydrocephalic patients never jellies by heat; but that author has rendered it probable that the urine will sometimes coagulate.—Ed. f I have recently attended an interesting little girl about four years old, whose head, two years ago, was greatly enlarged from this species of dropsy, from which she perfectly recovered under the use of purgatives and digitalis.—Ed. c 2

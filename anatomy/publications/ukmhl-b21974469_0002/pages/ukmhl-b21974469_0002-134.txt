94 itself was diseased. One of the parotid glands contained small fragments of calcarious matter. When the head was detached from the trunk it was supposed that as much serous fluid escaped from within the cranium, and from the vertebral canal, as would have filled a common wine bottle. On this account there was but little fluid discovered about the cerebrum or in the ventricles when the cranium was opened; and there was nothing else worthy of observation. A large quantity of fluid is often met with in the vertebral canal of persons who had been hemi- plegic ; but it is somewhat astonishing that so large a quantity should have accumulated in the head as well as in the spinal tube without inducing apoplexy.â€”Morgagni, xi. 15. Case 8. Paralysis from turgescence of vessels, and softness of texture in the brain. A woman, after a second attack of apoplexy, manifested a degree of stupor, and was nearly paralytic; one or two months afterwards she was attacked with fever, which was indicated by thirst, and the state of pulse. She died. Dissection. The vessels of the cerebrum were somewhat turgid with blood of a black colour; and there was so much laxity in the texture of the cerebrum itself that in some places, the cortical substance adhering to the pia mater, was drawn off as the dura mater was reflected. A small quantity of serum was contained in the third ventricle.

358 / Dissection. There was somewhat more fluid in the cavity of the abdomen than is natural; the stomach was greatly distended, and the omentum was drawn upwards. The mesenteric glands were enlarged, and somewhat indurated. The heart was not small but flaccid, and in the middle of its posterior surface there was a bony scale upon it of no inconsiderable extent; and a smaller scale was situated upon the right auricle. These osseous squamae adhered so closely to the fleshy fibres that they could not be separated without lacerating them. The internal surface of the aorta, near the valves, exhibited some distinct whitish spots ; some of which were also observed near the bifurcation of the aorta, and in the iliacs.â€”Morgagni, xxvii. 16. The heart, as well as the arteries, has been seen by others as well as myself partially ossified. Columbus, in some bodies, detected the septum ventriculorum converted into cartilage. Veslingius found the interior of the left ventricle surrounded with a cartilaginous incrustation ; and in the Sepulchretum a case is recorded, in which a carti- laginous excrescence existed near the left auricle, and even the auricles themselves, had become hard and cartilaginous. Where parts become cartilaginous, there seems no reason to doubt that they may become bony. The fleshy fibres of the heart are sometimes converted into the nature of tendons. Albertini met with some cases in which half the substance of the heart had acquired a tendinous structure and colour; and one instance of this kind came under my own observation. It may be observed that in the advance of life there is

341 mentioned by Valsalva, which, in colour and con- sistence, he said, resembled the medullary sub- stance of the brain. These and other appearances present themselves in the progress of the disease, according to the varieties of cause and constitution. Before the disease has made any considerable progress, the tubercles are solid and resemble conglobate glands. Indeed, during the first years of their existence, they may be so minute as in a great degree to elude discovery ; but they are developed as the person advances in life, and at an earlier or later period, as suitable causes to excite the disease into action may be applied.* Morgagni, xxii. 19. Consumptions may arise from a constitutional or an adventitious cause; and considerable diversity will be observed in the state of the lungs. It will be found in different cases, that both the appearance and the odour of pus are dissimilar; and sometimes it exists in conjunction with the indurated part of the lung, and, at others, these are separate lesions. One part has been in a state of suppuration, whilst * In the interesting case which led to these remarks on tubercles, the parotid glands are said to have been enlarged as well as all the glands of the neck. I believe the salivary and other conglo- merate glands are but seldom implicated in true scrofulous dis- eases. The glands so frequently enlarged in the neck, and other parts, where this diathesis prevails, it is understood, are the lymphatic or conglobate. That form of fungoid tumours desig- nated tuber a diffusa, and so well described by Dr. Farre, is perhaps often mistaken for a scrofulous disease. “ No texture” says he, “ seems to escape the ravages of this fungus. It appears indifferently in all the viscera, in the cellular membrane, and eveij in the bones.”—Ed.

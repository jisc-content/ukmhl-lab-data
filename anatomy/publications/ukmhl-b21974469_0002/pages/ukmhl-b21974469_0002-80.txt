40 evident that the quantity of food should be dimi- nished, blood should be withdrawn, and exertions of mind and body should be moderated.â€”3. Case 15. Apoplexy from extravasation into the ventricles, with degeneracy of structure in the brain, and disease of the heart and aorta. A husbandman of middle age, and rather cor- pulent, was brought into the hospital in the begin- ning of the year J748, in an apoplectic state. It was reported to be his third attack. His respiration was stertorous, and the whole body paralytic; he was destitute of sensibility, and incapable of mo- tion; his pulse was extremely slender; and death occurred within about seven or eight hours. Dissection. Four days elapsed before the dis- section was performed. The vessels about the head were turgid with blood. As soon as the cranium was opened a considerable quantity of dark coloured blood flowed down; the vessels dis- tributed through the pia mater of both the cerebrum and cerebellum, w ere extremely loaded, and a small quantity of blood was extravasated beneath this membrane in the middle of the left hemisphere. Into the ventricles a large quantity of blood was effused; for besides two or three ounces of coagula, fluid blood pervaded not only the lateral but also the third and fourth ventricles. The posterior sur- face of the left ventricle, and of the left thalamus of the optic nerve, discovered laceration; but an injury of this nature was more obvious in the right, where the thalamus was scarcely distinguishable, and no

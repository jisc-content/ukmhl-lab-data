The subject of the third case fell from a scaffold during his recovery; the lips of the cicatrix at their extremities were still united, but the central parts appeared to have been recently disjoined.—Med. Repos. Feb. 1819.

That form of paralysis designated shaking palsy has been ably discussed by Mr. Parkinson. He supposes the proximate cause to be a diseased state of the medulla spinalis, in that part which is contained in the canal formed by the superior cervical vertebrae, and extending as the disease proceeds, to the medulla oblongata.” Sometimes there is great discrepancy between the state of the mental faculties and the solution of muscular action: the latter may be limited to an unimportant part of the body, when the intellectual powers are nearly or totally destroyed. At other times there is an almost universal state of paralysis with unim- paired intellects. During many years I have been in occasional attendance upon'a case of this nature. The gentleman in the meridian of life became affected with vertigo, to which shaking

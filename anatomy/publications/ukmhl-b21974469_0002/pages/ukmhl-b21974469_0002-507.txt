4G7 was dilated into an enormous aneurism; but the dilatation was not uniform in degree. The aneu- rism adhered most tenaciously to the fourth and fifth dorsal vertebrae, which seemed to be a little curved to the right side ; and near these vertebrae, the expanded vessel had burst, and discharged its blood, by a large fissure, into the left cavity of the chest. The circumference of the foramen was ulcerated; and about it there were firm concretions hollowed out into a kind of tube. There were no morbid appearances worthy of observation in the abdomen, except on the right kidney, the upper half of which was converted into a bladder containing about three ounces of serum, which, on evaporation by heat, exhaled a urinous odour. The parietes of this vesicle were thin and highly vascular; and the vessels became extremely conspicuous by injecting them from the emulgent artery. As the lacteal vessels arose from the small intestines, from about eight digits below the pylorus to the distance of two ells, and passed to the centre of the mesentery, they presented the appearance of numerous whitish spots, having a diversity of figure and magnitude ; some of them were equal to the size of a lentil, and a few twice that size; but others were smaller. They were turgid with chyle, which tasted like milk, though inclining to a saltish flavour. Valsalva, xvii. 14. It is probable that the thoracic duct had been compressed by the bulky aneurism, and conse- quently the transmission of chyle through that canal had been interrupted, so that its vessels h h 2

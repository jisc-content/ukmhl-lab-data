282 nor did he expectorate any thing. On the fifth day he died. Dissection. There was a small quantity of a brownish serum in the left thoracic cavity, which escaped when the sternum was reflected. The lung on this side was greatly indurated; it was of a greenish colour, diversified, however, with black spots; and when cut into, a serous and putrid colluvies mixed with blood gushed out of it. Valsalva, xx. 45. Case 16. A man about twenty-six years of age was seized with a piercing pain in the right side of the thorax, and fever as well as cough were concomitant with it. He expectorated but little, and about the eighth day delirium came on; but it was most violent during the night. Notwithstanding a cessation of pain, the difficulty of respiration constantly in- creased, but he could easily lie upon either side. On the tenth day he died. Dissection. The whole texture of the pulmonary organs was indurated and their posterior surface had contracted some adhesion to the pleura, and the side of the left lung was also united to that membrane. The lungs and pleura were covered by a soft and reticulated substance, and by this, in many parts, their junction was effected. Both the cavities, but especially the right, contained a large quantity of a fluid like whey. When this fluid was set by, there was no separation of its constituents as in a former instance, but it coagulated by expo- sure to heat. The pericardium was turgid with serum.â€” Valsalva, xx. 47.

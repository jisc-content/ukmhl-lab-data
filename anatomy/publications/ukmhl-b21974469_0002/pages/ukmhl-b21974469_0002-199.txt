When seized he could take nothing into his mouth, nor rest in one place, but was constrained to walk about. The tonsils were slightly inflamed, and there was a copious discharge of acid humour by spitting. It appeared probable that the in- vesting membrane of the larynx and adjacent parts, (being morbidly sensible from the existence of slight inflammation) was a little irritated by the particles of wine, or the acrid secretion brought into contact with it during those acts which have just been particularized, and sometimes from its excess in quantity, and this irritation excited a sympathetic action in the muscles, by which the larynx was constringed. There seemed also a greater suscep- tibility of this spasmodic action, from the hypo- chondriac affection, which had been indicated by the hsemorrhoidal flux.

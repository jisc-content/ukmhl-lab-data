SECTION III. Hydrocephalus. Accumulations of a serous fluid in. the head arise under circumstances which have given occa- sion to a division into the acute and chronic forms. Acute Hydrocephalus. Case 1. An intelligent boy, thirteen years of age, whose brother and sister died of phthisis, was seized with pain in his forehead. His eyes also were painful, and discharged a viscid secretion. The following day he became delirious, his eyes were fixed, and he vomited a little tenacious matter. He was then seized with convulsions, and sunk into lethargy; from which, however, he was often roused by con- vulsions, attended with difficulty of respiration. He died. Dissection. The stomach contained greenish matter; the upper part of the right lobe of the lungs was occupied by a suppurated tubercle, the size of a walnut, resembling in colour and consistence the medullary substance of the brain. In the peri- cardium there were about two ounces of serum. The dura mater was tinged of a cineritious colour along the sides of the blood vessels. When the dura mater was torn from the crista galli a little puriform serum burst forth, and about an ounce of limpid serum escaped by the roots of the optic nerves. The pineal gland was unusually large. Valsalva, Epist. i. 2.

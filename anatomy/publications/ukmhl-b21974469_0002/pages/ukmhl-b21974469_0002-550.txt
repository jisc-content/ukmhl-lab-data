510 the weakest, and the most frequent I had ever met with. About four hours after coming into the hospital, he was attacked with such violent pain in what he designated the stomach, that from its severity, and the paleness of his face—from the cold perspiration which attended it—from the pulse being almost imperceptible—and from the respiration being in the state it generally is in dying persons, he appeared actually on the point of death. From this attack, however, he recovered, and related to the persons around him, that he had several times undergone similar paroxysms. His pulse returned to the state I have described. On the following day the physician ordered blood to be withdrawn from the arm, and directed the administration of suitable medicines. The tumour of the liver gradually disappeared after a few days, when the man was seized with pain in the region of the heart, accompanied with difficulty of breathing. A small quantity of blood was again withdrawn, by which the respiration was somewhat relieved, but the state of pulse was only improved in a slight degree—indeed it was so small and languid, in the temples as well as at the wrists, as to be scarcely perceptible. I applied my hand to the left side of the chest, and found that the heart beat with equal frequency, and with moderate power. The action of this organ was sensibly felt much below the region it occupies. It seemed to labour, and the patient solicited what are com- monly termed cordial medicines. About the eighth or ninth day after coming into the hospital he died suddenly.

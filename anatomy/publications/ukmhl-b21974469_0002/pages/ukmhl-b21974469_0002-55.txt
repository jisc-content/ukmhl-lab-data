15 little limpid serum escaped; the pia mater ap- peared slightly inflamed; the interstices of the convolutions were full of serum; a little serum, tinged with blood, was also found in the ventricles. The inflammation of the stomach and intestines, as well as of the pia mater, appeared to be of the erysipelatous kind.— Valsalva, vi. 8, 9. Case 4. Hydrocephalus from diseased liver. * A man, about forty years of age, who for many years was liable to periodical pain in the right hypochondrium, frequently attended with vomiting, and sometimes with ileus and delirium, had, al- most constantly, violent pain in the head. The eyes discharged a serous fluid. After excess in drinking wine, he suffered an attack of pain and vomiting, and although temporarily relieved by an empirical unction, the pain recurred, accompanied with delirium and convulsions; the latter ceased about an hour before death, on his becoming apo- plectic, when his respiration was oppressed; he foamed at the mouth, and his pulse was strong and full until death. Dissection.—The liver was indurated, and the abdomen contained a small quantity of serum. * Whilst it cannot justly be doubted that hydrocephalus results from different morbid conditions of the brain, it appears equally certain that it often arises from disease or disordered function in the abdominal and other distant organs. When there is evident disease in the head, and at the same time derangement in the functions of some other viscera, the abdominal for instance, it is often difficult to decide which part was primarily affected.—Ed.

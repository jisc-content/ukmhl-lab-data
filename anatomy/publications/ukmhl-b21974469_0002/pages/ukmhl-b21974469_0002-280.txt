240 CHAPTER II. DISEASES OF THE THORAX. THOUGH the parts contained in the thorax are fewer than those within the cranium, and not- withstanding their structure and functions are in- volved in less obscurity; yet they are so intimately united, from contiguity, connexions, or offices, that if one is injured or diseased the whole participate: and this circumstance frequently creates a difficulty in separating the primary and principal disease from those affections which are accessory. The cause of difficult respiration, however, may not only exist in the lungs and simultaneously in another part of the thorax, but the pulmonary affection may be associated with a disease exterior to the chest, and, most frequently, with disease in the head, the neck, or abdomen. Boerhaave said that there was scarcely a particle of the body which was not in a greater or less degree concerned in respiration; and consequently he was fully impressed with the difficulty which occasionally arises in determining whence the derangement of this function is derived. On this subject he says “ summam in morbis dif- “ Jicultatem facere magnum numerwn organorum, quce “ ad actionem concur runt, fy quorum aliquod Icesum “ totam functionem turbat, cum interim difficillimum “ sit scitu, quce ex toto numero proprie Icesa sit.” Morgagni, Epist. xv.

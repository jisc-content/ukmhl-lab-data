6 appearance of jelly. The sinus of the falx con- tained a thin and long coagulum of blood, an appearance which has not unfrequently been mis- taken for worms.â€” Valsalva, vii. 6. SECTION II. Diseases in the Membranes of the Brain. Case 1. The dura mater nearly ossified in an idiot. The body of a beggar was brought into the anatomical theatre in 1728. He had always mani- fested fatuity, and for a short time before death became so irrational as to throw away the bread he had begged. He had been liable to obstruction of the bowels as well as pain of the head. Dissection. The dura mater was firmly attached to the skull on the left side of the forehead, and to some extent this part of the membrane was con- verted into a structure betwixt bone and ligament. Although the cerebellum was soft and flaccid, and the medulla oblongata not very firm, yet the cere- brum was indurated, as it is frequently in idiots. There was a little limpid water in the lateral ventricles; the plexuses were colourless; some vesicles appeared on them which contained limpid fluid like that in the ventricles.

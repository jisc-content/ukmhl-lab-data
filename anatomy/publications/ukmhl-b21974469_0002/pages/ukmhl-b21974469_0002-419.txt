379 ascending steep places, Lancisi believed that this pulsation sometimes occurred. If, however, other signs of an affection of the heart are present, such as palpitation, oppression in the region of the heart, syncope, with a pulse generally full and equal—a dilatation of the right cavities may be inferred. Perhaps it may be justly said, however, that the pulse is the most equivocal symptom, as it is often rendered unequal from complication with disease in the left side of the heart.—11. In all the cases alluded to, the pulsation in the jugular veins must be ascribed to the contraction of the ventricle, and not to that of, the auricle. In some of them the auricle was callous ; and in a case by Dionis that sinus was covered with an osseous scaly substance, like a very hard egg-shell. It may sometimes, however, arise from the auricle ; and I believe it is possible to distinguish from which of these cavities it really happens. If the eye is fixed upon the veins at the time of applying the fingers to the artery, and the pulsations are found to be synchronous, it may be inferred that the impulse is derived from the ventricle; but if they are not synchronous the conclusion will be, that the pulsation of the veins is occasioned by the contraction of the right auricle.*—12. * In consequence of the frequency of complication, there are no symptoms which unequivocally distinguish an aneurism of one cavity from that of another. The sign proposed by Lancisi as characteristic of dilatation in the right side of the heart, has been observed in persons in whom the left cavities were found dilated. At the same time Corvisart thinks that when united with other circumstances, this venous pulsation, may enable us to form a pretty correct notion as to the side of the heart which

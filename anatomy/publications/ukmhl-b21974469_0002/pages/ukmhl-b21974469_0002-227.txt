187 within that time he had consulted the most eminent physicians in the principal cities of Europe, and amongst them Valsalva’s opinion had been sought by letter. Written descriptions of cases, however, do not afford so accurate an idea of disease as is obtained by an interview; and at length Valsalva had an opportunity of seeing the patient. He observed, that on wiping the nose, or touching it with his fingers, the hemorrhage, though previously decreasing, was accelerated ; and having found in dissection that the blood-vessels were extremely turgid at the line of union between the alae nasi and bone, about a finger’s breadth from the orifice of the nostril, he suspected that the blood was effused from that part, and on pressing it with his finger the hemorrhage ceased. By this easy method the patient was ultimately cured.— Valsalva, xiv. 24. Case 2. Some vessels were ruptured in the nostril of a poor widow by sneezing, and hemorrhage had con- tinued for nine hours when I saw her. She had very properly been bled. I directed firm bolsters of lint to be introduced, by which the bleeding was imme- diately suppressed. They were moistened indeed with the juice of nettles, by which alone, when snuffed into the nostrils, I have seen hemorrhage restrained. Soft tents had been tried, but they are unavailable for compression in such cases. She had lost so much blood, however, that sixteen days afterwards my advice was solicited relative to a state of general indisposition, accompanied with palpitation of the heart, and difficulty of respiration.

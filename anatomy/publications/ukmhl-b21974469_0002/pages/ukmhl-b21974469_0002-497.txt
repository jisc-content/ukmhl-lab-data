457 any thing else with which I could compare *t.*—Morgagni, xviii. 22. The disease, I thought, in this case, was attri- butable to frequent and strong inflation of the lungs ; for whatever interferes with natural respi- ration disturbs the circulation of the blood, so that sometimes it is excited and at others obstructed. Hence persons who habitually use wind instru- ments, or who are subject to violent cough, are very liable to aneurism. By comparing the observations of various authors with those which have occurred to me, I find that at the curvature of the aorta, or very near it, aneu- risms of this vessel are usually found. The blood is driven into this part from the left ventricle with greater impetus, and is proportionately repelled by the curve, when the vessel contracts, into the contiguous parts of the vessel. But the blood is more easily received into the descending aorta than into that portion which ascends from the heart, because it is shorter, has no branches, and is closed by the semilunar valves; and therefore aneurismal dilatations are more liable to happen between the curvature and the heart, than in any other adjacent part. Aneurisms are much less * Mr. Armiger has related an interesting case of dysphagia from aneurism of the descending aorta. The aneurism ultimately burst into the oesophagus, at about two inches from the diaphragm. There had been considerable difference in the pulsations of the two radial arteries. In the left wrist they varied in frequency from 90 to 100, and were the smallest and weakest; in the right wrist they were 100 to 110 in the minute. Med. Chir. Trans, vol, ii.—Ed. /

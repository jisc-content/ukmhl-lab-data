123 When the calvarium and dura mater had been removed, a few drops of extravasated blood were found upon the pia mater near the longitudinal sinus, on the left hemisphere; and the vessels of this membrane over the right hemisphere were greatly distended with blood, and of a black colour. An almost limpid serous fluid was depo- sited between the convolutions ; there was scarcely any in the ventricles, but a large quantity had accumulated about the foramen magnum of the occipital bone; and when the spine was divided at the border of the thorax water flowed from its canal. The palsy of the lower limbs and bladder must be ascribed to the fluid which possessed the spinal canal; the spasmodic affections to the state of the encephalon and spine conjointly. Morgagni, x. 13. Case 8. Convulsions from turgescence of vessels and deposition of serum, in the brain and within the spinal canal. A wool-comber, twenty-one years of age, was attacked with fever, in the course of which he had an accession of delirium. Having experienced a remission of the mental wandering, he was brought into this hospital, where convulsive actions were immediately observed in the muscles of the upper limbs, and consequently subsultus tendinum in both wrists. There was no inflammatory crust on the blood which was withdrawn, but it was of an extremely dense and compact quality. An op- pressive state of coma ensued ; and three daya afterwards he died.

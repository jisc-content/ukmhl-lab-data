366 Aneurisms of the heart. Internal aneurisms of the thorax, not only com- press the lungs in consequence of their bulk, and retard the circulation of blood through them, but they often oppress the diaphragm by their weight; so that, in various ways, they prove injurious to respiration. The most frequent affections of this nature are dilatations of the heart and of the aorta. These diseases, of course, were not discovered till anatomy was pursued by the dissection of human bodies. Yet the doctrine of dilatation of the aorta made so slow a progress, that in the year 1595, when Sylvatica published his Treatise on Aneurism, he did not mention them; and, many years afterwards, Riolanus asserted that aneurism been extravasated into the cellular substance, to the extent of about half an inch, and a small surface over the left ventricle betrayed marks of superficial inflammation. The carneae co- lumns were enlarged; the right auricle, aud both ventricles, contained each a large polypus, attached by three or four pedicles. That in the right auricle weighed upwards of an ounce; and each of the others, an ounce. They were of a pale red colour, solid and firm ; and when cut into were observed to be highly vascular. Ed. Med. and Surg. Journal, April 1817. Corvisart entertains the opinion that polypous concretions might form previous to death. He divides the concretions into three kinds. First—Those which are of longer or shorter standing, which may be known by their pale fleshy colour, their density, their fibrous or fibrinous organization, and the force by which they adhere to some parts of the cavities of the heart. Secondly— The polypus-like concretions formed in the latter days of life— of a yellow lymphatic colour; feebly adherent. Thirdly—A kind of magma or coagulum like badly prepared currant jelly. He admits, however, that there may rather be different degrees of the same thing, than distinct species.—Ed.

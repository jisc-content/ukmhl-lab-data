617 THE TEETH. limited sensibility. Around the necks of the teeth, this membrane presents numerous fine papillas; and from this point it is reflected into the alveolus, where it is continuous with the periosteal membrane lining that cavity. The Teeth. The human subject is provided with two sets of teeth, which make their appearance at different periods of life. The first set appear in childhood, and are called the temporary, deciduous, or milk teeth. The second set, which also appear at an early period, continue until old age, and are named permanent. The temporary teeth are twenty in number; four incisors, two canine, and four molars, in each jaw. The permanent teeth are thirty-two in number; four incisors, two central and two lateral, two canine, four bicuspids, and six molars, in each jaw. General characters. Each tooth consists of three portions; the crown or body, 320.â€”The Permanent Teeth. External View. Molars JBieitspids Canine Incisors Canine projecting above the gum; the root, or fang, entirely concealed within the alveolus; and the neck, the constricted portion between the other two. The roots of the teeth are firmly implanted within the alveoli: these depressions are lined with periosteum, which is reflected on to the tooth at the point of the fang, and covers it as far as the neck. At the margin of the alveolus, the peri- osteum becomes continuous with the fibrous structure of the gums. Permanent Teeth. The Incisors, or cutting teeth, are so named from their presenting a sharp, cutting edge, adapted for cutting the food. They are eight in number, and form the four front teeth in each jaw.

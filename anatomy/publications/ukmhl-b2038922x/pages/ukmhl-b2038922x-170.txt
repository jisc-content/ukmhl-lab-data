OSTEOLOGY. *34 Structure. It consists of dense cancellous tissue, covered by a thin compact lamina. Development.

In two in stances, I have seen this bone cartilaginous throughout, at a much later period (six years). More rarely, the bone is deve- loped by two centres, placed side by side. Articulations. With the two condyles of the femur. Attachment of Muscles. The Rectus, Crureus, Vastus inter- ims, and Vastus externus. These muscles joined at their insertion, constitute the Quadriceps exten- sor cruris. The Tibia. The Tibia is situated at the front and inner side of the leg, and, excepting the femur, is the longest and largest bone in the skeleton. It is prismoid in form, expanded above, where it enters into the knee-joint, more slightly enlarged below. In the male, its direction is vertical, and parallel with the bone of the opposite side; but in the female it has a slight oblique direction downwards and outwards, to compensate for the oblique di- rection of the femur inwards. It presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity, or head, is large and expanded on each side into two lateral emi- nences, the tuberosities. Supe- riorly, the tuberosities present two smooth concave surfaces, which articulate with the con- dyles of the femur; the internal articular surface is longer than the external, and oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle; the external one being broader, flatter, and more circular, to articulate with the external condyle. Between the two articular surfaces, and nearer the posterior than the Styloid jjroee* EjclPjr.niil. N.tUtntus

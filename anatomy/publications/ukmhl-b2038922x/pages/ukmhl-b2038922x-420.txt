3^4 ARTERIES. The brandies of the ulnar artery may be arranged into the following groups, Anterior ulnar recurrent. Posterior ulnar recurrent. T \ Anterior interosseous.

The anterior ulnar re- current arises immediately below the elbow-joint,passes upwards and inwards be- tween the Brachialis anti- cus and Pronator radii teres, supplies these muscles, and, in front of the inner con- dyle, anastomoses with the anastomotica magna and in- ferior profunda. The posterior ulnar re- current is much larger, and arises somewhat lower than the preceding. It passes backwards and inwards, be- neath the Flexor sublimis, and ascends behind the inner condyle of the humerus. In the interval between this process and the olecranon, it lies beneath the Flexor carpi ulnaris, ascending be- tween the heads of that muscle, beneath the ulnar nerve; it supplies the neigh- bouring muscles and joint, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda, anasto- motica magna, and inter- osseous recurrent arteries. The interosseous artery is a short trunk, about an inch in length, and of con- siderable size, which arises immediately below the tu- berosity of the radius, and, passing backwards to the upper border of the inter- osseous membrane, divides into two branches, the an- terior, and posterior inter- osseous. The anterior interosseous passes down the forearm on the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, -D ascending Brunch from Sivp e rio ■rJ'rofu ttdtv Anastomotic JPaxtesrior UlnwrHecu r ven i terior Jiilerosse.ous Termination of 1 n teriorlnterossco eis TostsrioT Carpal (Jiadial) DorsnTis Indicts

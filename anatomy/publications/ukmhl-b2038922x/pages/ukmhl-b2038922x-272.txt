236 MUSCLES AND FASCIiE. arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebras; and, ascending obliquely inwards, is inserted by a narrow tendon into the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas. The inferior oblique portion, the smallest part of the muscle, arises from the bodies of the first two or three dorsal vertebras; and, passing obliquely outwards, is iuserted into the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebras. 158â€”The Pras-Vertebral Muscles. The vertical -portion lies directly on the front of the spine, and is extended between the bodies of the lower three cervical and the upper three dorsal vertebras below, and the bodies of the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebras above. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the pharynx, the oesophagus, sympathetic nerve, the sheath of the great vessels of the neck, the inferior thyroid artery, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. By its posterior surface, with the cervical and dorsal portions of the spine. Its inner border is separated from the opposite muscle by a considerable interval below; but they approach each other above. 8. Vertebral Region (Lateral). Scalenus Anticus. Scalenus Medius. Scalenus Posticus. The Scalenus Anticus is a conical-shaped muscle, situated deeply at the side of the neck, behind the Sterno-mastoid. It arises by a narrow, flat tendon from the tubercle on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib; and, ascending

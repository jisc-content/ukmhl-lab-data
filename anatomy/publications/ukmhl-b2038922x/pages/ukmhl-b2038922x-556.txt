520 CRANIAL NERVES. integument covering the temple and side of the forehead, communicating with the facial and auriculotemporal branch of the inferior maxillary nerve. The malar branch passes along the external inferior angle of the orbit, emerges upon the face through a foramen in the malar bone, and perforating the Orbi- cularis palpebrarum muscle on the prominence of the cheek, joins with the facial. The Spheno-palatine branches, two in number, descend to the spheno-palatine ganglion. The posterior dental branches arise from the trunk of the nerve just as it is about to enter the infraorbital canal; they are two in number, posterior and anterior. 280.â€”Distribution of the Second and Third Divisions of the Fifth Nerve and Sub-maxillary Ganglion. The posterior branch passes from behind forwards in the substance of the superior maxillary bone, and joins opposite the canine fossa with the anterior dental. Numerous filaments are given off from the lower border of this nerve, which form a minute plexus in the outer wall of the superior maxillary bone, immediately above the alveolus. From this plexus, filaments are distributed to the pulps of the molar and bicuspid teeth, the lining membrane of the antrum, and corresponding portion of the gums. The anterior branch is distributed to the gums and Buccinator muscle. The anterior dental, of large size, is given off from the superior maxillary nerve just before its exit from the infraorbital foramen; it enters a special canal ii. the anterior wall of the antrum, and anastomoses with the posterior dental. From this nerve some filaments are distributed to the incisor, canine, and first

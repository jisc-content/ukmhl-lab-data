The conjoined tendon of the Internal oblique and Transversalis is inserted into the crest of the os pubis and pectineal line, immediately behind the external abdominal ring, serving to protect what would otherwise be a weak point in the 164.—The Internal Oblique Muscle. abdomen. Sometimes this tendon is insufficient to resist the pressure from within, and is carried forward in front of the protrusion through the external ring, forming one of the coverings of direct inguinal hernia. The aponeurosis of the Internal oblique is continued forward to the middle line of the abdomen, where it joins with the aponeurosis of the opposite muscle at the linea alba, and extends from the margin of the thorax to the pubes. At the outer margin of the Rectus muscles, this aponeurosis for the upper three-fourths of its extent, divides into two lamellae, which pass, one in front and the other behind it, enclosing it in a kind of sheath, and reuniting on its inner border

The lig amentum arcuatum externum is the thickened upper margin of the anterior lamella of the transversalis fascia; it arches across the upper part of the Quadratus lumborum, being attached, by one extremity, to the front of the trans- verse process of the second lumbar vertebra; and, by the other, to the apex and lower margin of the last rib. To the spine, the Diaphragm is connected by two crura, which are situated on the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, one on each side of the aorta. The crura, at their origin, are tendinous in structure; the right crus, larger and longer than the left, arising from the anterior surface of the bodies and intervertebral substances of the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebras; the left, from the second and 167.â€”The Diaphragm.

A tendinous arch is thrown across the front of the vertebral column, from the tendon of one crus to that of the other, beneath which passes the aorta, vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. The tendons terminate in two large fleshy bellies, which, with the tendinous portions above alluded to, are called the crura, or pillars of the dia- phragm. The outer fasciculi of the two crura are directed upwards and outwards to the central tendon; but the inner fasciculi decussate in front of the aorta, and then diverge, so as to surround the oesophagus before ending in the central tendon. The anterior and larger of these fasciculi is formed by the right crus. The Central or Cordiform Tendon of the Diaphragm is a thin tendinous apo- neurosis, situated at the centre of the vault of this muscle, immediately beneath the pericardium, with which its circumference is blended. It is shaped somewhat S 2

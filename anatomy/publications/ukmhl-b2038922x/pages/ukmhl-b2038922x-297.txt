261 OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. inspiration, the cavity of the thorax is enlarged in the vertical direction from two to three inches, partly from the ascent of the walls of the chest, partly from the descent of the Diaphragm. The chest, consequently, encroaches upon the abdomen; the lungs are expanded, and lowered, in relation with the ribs, nearly two inches; the heart being drawn down about an inch and a half; the descent of the latter organ taking place indirectly through the medium of its connection with the lungs, as well as directly by means of the central tendon to which the peri- cardium is attached. The abdominal viscera are also pushed down (the liver, to the extent of nearly three inches), so that these organs are no longer protected by the ribs. During expiration, when the Diaphragm is passive, it is pushed up by the action of the abdominal muscles; the cavity of the abdomen (with the organs contained in it), encroaches upon the chest, by which the lungs and heart are compressed upwards, and the vertical diameter of the thoracic civity diminished. The Diaphragm is passive when raised or lowered, by the abdominal organs, independently of respiration, in proportion as they are large or small, full or empty; hence the oppression felt in the chest after a full meal, or from flatulent distension of the stomach and intestines. In all expulsive acts, the Diaphragm is called into action, to give additional power to each expulsive effort. Thus, before sneezing, coughing, laughing, and crying; before vomiting; previous to the expulsion of the urine and faces, or of the foetus from the womb, a deep inspiration takes place.* MUSCLES AND FASCIAE OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY.

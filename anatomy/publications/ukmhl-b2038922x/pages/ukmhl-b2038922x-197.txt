161 OF THE ATLAS WITH THE AXIS. variety of movement, flexion and extension being very free; lateral movement and rotation, although less extensive than the former, being greater than in any other region. In the dorsal region, especially at its upper part, the movements are most limited; flexion, extension, and lateral motion taking place only to a slight extent. In the lumbar region, all the movements are very free. II. Articulation of the Atlas with the Axis. The articulation of the anterior arch of the atlas with the odontoid process forms a lateral ginglymoid joint, whilst that between the articulating processes of the two bones forms a double arthrodia. The ligaments which connect these bones are, the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid. Transverse. Posterior Atlo-Axoid. Two Capsular. Of the Two Anterior Atlo-Axoid Ligaments (fig. 117), the more superficial is a rounded cord, situated in the middle line; it is attached, above, to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas; below, to the base of the odontoid process and body of the axis. The deeper ligament is a membranous layer, attached,, above, to the lower border of the anterior arch of the atlas; below, to the base of the odontoid process, and body of the axis. These ligaments are in relation, in front, with the Recti antici majores. The Posterior-Axoid Ligament (fig. 118) is a broad and thin membranous layer, attached, above, to the lower border of the posterior arch of the atlas; 118.â€”Occipito-Atloid and Atlo-Axoid Ligaments.

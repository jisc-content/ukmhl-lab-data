424 ARTERIES. From the arrangement already described of the distribution of the vessels to the toes, it will be seen that both sides of the three outer toes, and the outer side ..

Pulmonary Artery. The pulmonary artery conveys the venous blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. It is a short wide vessel, about two inches in length, arising from the left side of the base of the right ventricle, in front of the aorta. It ascends obliquely upwards, backwards, and to the left side, as far as the under surface of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into two branches of nearly equal size, the right and left pulmonary arteries. Relations. The greater part of this vessel is contained, together with the ascending part of the arch of the aorta, in the pericardium, being enclosed with it in a tube of serous membrane, continued upwards from the base of the heart, and has attached to it, above, the fibrous layer of the membrane. Behind, it rests at first upon the ascending aorta, and higher up lies in front of the left auricle. On either side of its origin is the appendix of the corresponding auricle, and a coronary artery; and higher up it passes to the left side of the ascending aorta. A little to the left of its point of bifurcation, it is connected to the under surface of the arch of the aorta by a short fibrous cord, the remains of a vessel peculiar to foetal life, the ductus arteriosus. The right pulmonary artery, longer and larger than the left, runs horizontally outwards, behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava, to the root of the right lung, where it divides into two branches, of which the lower, which is the larger, supplies the lower lobe; the upper giving a branch to the middle lobe.

Development of the Foot. (Fig. 115). The Tarsal bones are each developed by a single centre, excepting the os calcis, which has an epiphysis for its posterior extremity. The centres make their appearance in the following order: in the os calcis, at the sixth month of foetal life; 115.—Plan of the Development of the Foot. ^Ap-p.UO&yZ unites after -puberty Tarsus / Centre far e-cbcA %o7l& jacce-pt 0.9 CaZcijt Metatarsus 2 Centres for each Lone I far Shaft / far Digital Hxt re mity JPJicblatig e s 2Centresfar eaclo ioru- IforSUft /for Metatarsal Ext.V JLppCUTS 6$" >/ ?

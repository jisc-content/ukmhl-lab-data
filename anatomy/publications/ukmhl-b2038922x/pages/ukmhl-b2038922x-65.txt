The superior extends on each side from the superior to the lateral angle, is deeply serrated for articulation with the parietal bone, and forms, by this union, the lambdoid suture. The inferior border extends from the lateral to the inferior angle; its upper half is rough, and articulates with the mastoid por- tion of the temporal, forming the masto-occipital suture: the inferior half articu- lates with the petrous portion of the temporal, forming the petro-occipital suture: these two portions are separated from one another by the jugular process. In front of this process is a deep notch, which with a similar one on the petrous portion ©f the temporal, forms the foramen lacerum posterius. This notch is occasionally subdivided into two parts by a small process of bone, and presents an aperture at its upper part, the internal opening of the posterior condyloid foramen. Structure. The occipital bone consists of two compact laminae, called the outer and inner tables, having between them the diploic tissue; this bone is especially thick at the ridges, protuberances, condyles, and anterior part of the basilar process; whilst at the bottom of the fossae, especially the inferior, it is thin, semi- transparent, and destitute of diploe. Development (fig. 24). The occipital bone has four centres of development; one for the posterior or occi- 24.—Development of Occipital Bone.

The centre for the occipi- tal portion appears about the tenth week of foetal life; and consists, according to Blandin and Cruvelhier, of a small oblong plate which appears in the situation of the occi- pital protuberance.* The r condyloid portions then ossify, U> and lastly the basilar portion. ' At birth, the bone consists of four parts, separate from one another, the occipital portion being fissured in the direction above indicated. At about the fourth year, the occipital and the two con- dyloid pieces join; and about the sixth year the bone consists of a single piece. At a later period, between the eighteenth and twenty-fifth years, the occipital and sphenoid become united, forming a single bone. Articulations.

To the space between the curved lines, the Complexus, Splenius capitis, and Obliquus superior; to the inferior curved line, and the space between it and the foramen magnum, the Rectus posticus major and minor; to the transverse process, the Rectus lateralis; and to the basilar process, the Recti antici majores and minores, and Superior Constrictor of the pharynx. The Parietal Bones. The Parietal Bones (paries, a wall), form by their union the sides and roof of * Beclard considers this segment to have four centres of ossification, arranged in pairs, two above, and two below the curved lines, and Meckel describes eight, four of which correspond in situation with those above described, of the other four, two are placed in juxta-position, at the upper angle of the bone, and the remaining two, one at each side, in the lateral angles.

ARTICULATIONS. i68 one another, and are each lined by a separate synovial membrane. In the first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, the interarticular ligament does not exist; consequently, there is but one synovial membrane. Actions. The movements permitted in these articulations are limited to eleva- tion, depression, and a slight amount of movement forwards and backwards. The mobility, however, of the different ribs varies very much. The first rib is almost entirely immoveable, excepting in deep inspiration. The movement of the second rib is also not very extensive. In the other ribs, their mobility increases succes- sively to the last two, which are very moveable. The ribs are generally more moveable in the female than in the male. 2. Articulation of the Neck and Tubercle of the Ribs with the Transverse Processes. The ligaments connecting these parts, are— Anterior Costo-Transverse. Middle Costo-Transverse (Interosseous). Posterior Costo-Transverse. Capsular. The Anterior Costo-Transverse Ligament (fig. 125) is a broad and strong- band of fibres, attached below to the sharp crest on the upper border of the neck of each rib, and passing obliquely upwards and outwards, to the lower border of 125.—Costo-Transverse Articulation. Seen from above. the transverse process immediately above. It is broader below than above, broader and thinner between the lower ribs than between the upper, and more distinct in front than behind. This ligament is in relation, in front, with the intercostal vessels and nerves ; behind, Avith the Longissimus dorsi. Its internal border completes an aperture formed between it and the articular processes, through which pass the posterior branches of the intercostal vessels and nerves. Its ex- ternal border is continuous with a thin aponeurosis, which covers the External intercostal muscle. The first and last ribs have no anterior costo-transverse ligament. The Middle Costo-Transverse or Interosseous Ligament consists of short, but

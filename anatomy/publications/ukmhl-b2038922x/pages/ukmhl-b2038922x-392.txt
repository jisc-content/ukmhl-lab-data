The relation of the internal carotid with the tonsil should be especially remem- bered, as instances have occurred in which the artery has been wounded during the operation of scarifying the tonsil, and fatal hemorrhage has supervened. The branches given off from the internal carotid are: From the Petrous Portion . Tympanic. ( Arterise receptaculi. From the Cavernous Portion \ Anterior meningeal. [ Ophthalmic. iAnterior cerebral. Middle cerebral. Posterior communicating. Anterior choroid. The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches. The tympanic is a small branch which enters the cavity of the tympanum, through a minute foramen in the carotid canal, and anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and with the stylo-mastoid artery. The arterice receptaculi are numerous small vessels, derived from the internal carotid in the cavernous sinus; they supply the pituitary body, the Casserian ganglion, and the walls of the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses. One of these branches, distributed to the dura mater, is called the anterior meningeal; it anastomoses with the middle meningeal. The Ophthalmic Artery arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel 213. -The Ophthalmic Artery and its Branches, the Roof of the Orbit having been removed.

ARTERIES. 342 the Genio-hyo-glossus. The hypoglossal nerve lies nearly parallel with the lingual artery, separated from it, in the second part of its course, by the Hyo- glossus muscle. The branches of the lingual artery are, the Hyoid. Sublingual. Dorsalis Linguae Ranine. The lipoid branch runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone, supplying the muscles attached to it, and anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. The dorsalis Ungues (fig. 212) arises from the lingual artery beneath the Hyo- glossus muscle; ascending to the dorsum of the tongue, it supplies its mucous membrane, the tonsil, soft palate, and epiglottis; anastomosing with its fellow from the opposite side. The sublingual, which may be described as a branch of bifurcation of the lingual artery, arises at the anterior margin of the Hyo-glossus muscle, and, running forwards and outwards beneath the Mylo-hyoid to the sublingual gland, supplies its substance, giving branches to the Mylo-hyoid and neighbouring muscles, the mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. 209.â€”The Arteries of the Face and Scalp.* / The ranine may be regarded as the other branch of bifurcation, or, as is more usual, as the continuation of the lingual artery; it runs along the under surface * The muscular tissue of the lips must be supposed to have been cut away, in order to show the course of the coronary arteries.

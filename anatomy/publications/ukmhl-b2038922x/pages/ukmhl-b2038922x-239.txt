203 OF THE PHALANGES. Actions. The movement permitted in the tarsal ends of the metatarsal bones is limited to a slight gliding of the articular surfaces upon one another; considerable motion, however, takes place in their digital extremities. VII. Metatarsophalangeal Articulations. The heads of the metatarsal bones are connected with the concave articular surfaces of the first phalanges by the following ligamentsâ€” Anterior or Plantar. Two Lateral. They are arranged precisely similar to the corresponding parts in the hand. The expansion of the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament. Actions. The movements permitted in the metatarsophalangeal articulations are flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. VIII. Articulations of the Phalanges. The ligaments of these articulations are similar to those found in the hand; each pair of phalanges being connected by an anterior or plantar and two lateral ligaments, and their articular surfaces lined by synovial membrane. Their actions are also similar.

PULMONARY. 425 The left pulmonary artery, shorter but somewhat smaller than the right, passes horizontally in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to the root of the left lung, where it divides into two branches for the two lobes. The terminal branches of the pulmonary artery will be described with the anatomy of the lung. The author has to acknowledge valuable aid derived from the following works:— Harrison's 'Surgical Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body.' Dublin, 1824.— Richard Quain's Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body.' London, 1844.—Sibson's 'Medical Anatomy'; and the other works on General and Microscopic Anatomy before referred to.

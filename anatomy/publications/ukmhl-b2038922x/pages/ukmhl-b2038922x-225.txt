Its posterior surface blends with the ligaments of the metacarpo- phalangeal articulation. LATERAL LICAMENT X. Metacarpophalangeal Articulations (fig. 137). These articulations are of the ginglymoid kind, formed by the reception of the rounded head of the metacarpal bone, into a superficial cavity in the extremity of the first phalanx. They are connected by the following ligaments : Anterior. Two Lateral.

Their Metacarpo -jahalalujeal palmar surface is intimately -^Tt,c • blended with the transverse ligament, forming a groove for the passage of the flexor tendons, the sheath surround- ing which is connected to each side of the groove. By their internal surface, they form part of the articular surface for the head of the metacarpal bone, and are lined by a synovial membrane. The Lateral Ligaments are strong rounded cords, placed one on each side of the joint, each being attached by one Phalangeal extremity to the tubercle on Artic ff the side of the head of the metacarpal bone, and by the other to the contiguous ex- tremity of the phalanx. The posterior ligament is supplied by the extensor ten- don placed over the back of each joint. Actions. The movements which occur in these joints are flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction; the lateral move- ments are very limited. XL Articulations op the Phalanges. These are ginglymoid joints, connected by the following ligaments: Anterior. Two Lateral. The arrangement of these ligaments is similar to those in the metacarpo-pha- langeal articulations ; the extensor tendon supplies the place of a posterior ligament.

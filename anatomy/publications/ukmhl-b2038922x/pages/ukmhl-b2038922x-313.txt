277 ANTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. -Front of the Left Forearm. Deep Muscles. The Flexor Longns Polli- cis is situated on the radial side of the forearm, lying on the same plane as the prece- ding. It arises from the up- per two-thirds of the grooved anterior surface of the shaft of the radius; commencing, above, immediately below the tuberosity and oblique line, and extending, below, to with- in a short distance of the Pronator quadratus. It also arises from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane, and occasionally by a fleshy slip from the inner side of the base of the coronoid process. The fibres pass downwards and terminate in a flattened tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, is then lodged in the interspace be- tween the two heads of the Flexor brevis pollicis, and entering a tendino-osseous ca- nal similar to those for the other flexor tendons, is in- serted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the Flexor sub- lines digitorum, Flexor carpi radialis, Supinator longus, and radial vessels. By its poste- rior surface, with the radius, interosseous membrane, and Pronator quadratus. By its ulnar border, with the Flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve. The Pronator Quadratus is a small, flat, quadrilateral muscle, extending trans- versely across the front of the radius and ulna, above their carpal extremities. It arises from the oblique line on the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, and the surface of bone immediately below it; from the internal border of the ulna; and from a strong aponeurosis which covers the

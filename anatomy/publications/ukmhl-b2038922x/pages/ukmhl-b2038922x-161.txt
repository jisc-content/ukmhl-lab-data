125 PELVIS. The superior circumference forms the margin or brim of the pelvis, the included space being called the inlet. It is formed by the linea ileo-pectinea, completed in front by the spine and crest of the pubes, and behind by the anterior margin of the base of the sacrum and sacro-vertebral angle. 100.—Male Pelvis (Adult). 101.—Female Pelvis (Adult). The inlet of the pelvis is somewhat heart-shaped, obtusely pointed in front, diverging on either side, and encroached upon behind by the projection forwards of the promontory of the sacrum. It has three principal diameters: antero- posterior (sacro-pubic), transverse, and oblique. The antero-posterior extends from the sacro-vertebral angle to the symphysis pubis; its average measurement is four inches. The transverse extends across the greatest width of the inlet,

476 NERVOUS SYSTEM. 257.—Transverse Section of the grey substance of the spinal cord, near the middle of the dorsal region. Magnified 13 diameters. J. L. Clarke, del. the horn (fig. 257), round which is the lighter space or lamina, the gelatinous substance; and the cervix cornu, or remaining narrow portion of the horn, as far forwards as the central canal. The gelatinous substance contains along its border a series of large nerve- cells ; but more internally consists of a stratum of small cells traversed by transverse, oblique, and longitudinal fibres (figs. 258, 259). Nearly the whole inner half of the cervix is occupied by a remarkable and important column of nerve-cells, called the posterior vesicular column (fig. 257), which varies in size and appearance in different regions of the cord, and is intimately connected with the posterior roots of the nerves. Within, and along the outer border of the cervix are several thick bundles of longitudinal fibres, represented in the adjoining figure by the dark spots; other bundles of the same kind may be seen in the grey substance along the line of junction of the caput with the cervix cornu (fig. 258). The anterior horn of the grey sub- stance in the cervical and lumbar swellings, where it gives origin to the nerves of the extremities, is much larger than in any other region, and contains several distinct groups of large and variously shaped cells. This is well shown on comparing the above figures. 258.—Transverse Section of the grey substance of the spinal cord through the middle of the lumbar enlargement. On the left side the groups of large cells are seen; on the right side the course of the fibres without the cells. Magnified 13 diameters. J. L.

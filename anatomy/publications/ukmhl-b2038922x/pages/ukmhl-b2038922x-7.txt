PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. JN this Edition of the very successful work of the late Mr. Gray, no change has been attempted on the original scheme of the book; nor has any modification been made in the execution of that scheme. The absence of any attempt in this work to teach the rudiments of scientific, as distinguished from descriptive anatomy, was felt as a defect by its author during his life, and the sub- ject of the expediency of adding a chapter on that branch of anatomy, was discussed between him and the present Editor: but it was thought that, so long as the Examining Bodies do not exact a knowledge of this branch of science as a necessary part of Medical Education, it would be un- wise to encumber the pages of a work, designed especially for Students, with matter which, however interesting and valuable in itself, could hardly be regarded as essential, while it must necessarily have added a good deal to the bulk and cost of the work. Consequently, the Editor's task has been restricted to an attempt to give greater precision to the language, and to supply the necessary references to anatomical works of merit which had been published since the date of the last Edition. November, 1863.

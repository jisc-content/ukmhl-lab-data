ARTERIES. 386 The Thoracic Aorta commences at the lower border of the third dorsal ver- tebra, on the left side, and terminates at the aortic opening in the Diaphragm, in front of the last dorsal vertebra. At its commencement, it is situated on the left side of the spine; it approaches the median line as it descends; and, at its termi- nation, lies directly in front of the column. The direction of this vessel being influenced by the spine, upon which it rests, it describes a curve which is concave forwards in the dorsal region. As the branches given ofT from it are small, the diminution in the size of the vessel is inconsiderable. It is contained in the back part of the posterior mediastinum, being in relation, in front, from above downwards, with the left pulmonary artery, the left bronchus, the pericardium, and the oesophagus; behind, with the vertebral column, and the vena azygos minor; on the right side, with the vena azygos major, and thoracic duct; on the left side, with the left pleura, and lung. The oesophagus, with its accompanying nerves, lies on the right side of the aorta above: in front of this vessel, in the middle of its course; whilst, at its lower part, it is on the left side, on a plane anterior to it.

Surgical Anatomy, The student should now consider the effects likely to be produced by aneurism of the thoracic aorta, a disease of common occurrence. When we consider the great depth of the vessel from the surface, and the number of important structures which surround it on every side, it may be easily conceived what a variety of obscure symptoms may arise from disease of this part of the arterial system, and how they may be liable to be mistaken for those of other affections. Aneurism of the thoracic aorta most usually extends backwards, along the left side of the spine, producing absorption of the bodies of the vertebrae, with curvature of the spine ; whilst the irritation or pressure on the cord, will give rise to pain, either in the chest, back, or loins, with radiating pain in the left upper intercostal spaces, from pressure on the intercostal nerves ; at the same time, the tumour may project back on each side of the spine, beneath the integument, as a pulsating swelling, simulating abscess connected with diseased bone ; or it may displace the oesophagus, and compress the lung on one or the other side. If the tumour extend forward, it may press upon and displace the heart, giving rise to palpitation and other symptoms of disease of that organ; or it may displace, or even compress, the oesophagus, causing pain and difficulty of swallowing, as in stricture of that tube, and ultimately even open into it by ulceration, producing fatal haemorrhage. If the disease make way to either side, it may press upon the thoracic duct; or it may burst into the pleural cavity, or into the trachea or lung ; and lastly, it may open into the posterior mediastinum. The aorta is, comparatively often, found to be obliterated at a particular spot, viz., at the junction of the arch with the thoracic aorta, just below the ductus arteriosus. Whether this is the result of disease, or of congenital malformation, is immaterial to our present purpose; it affords an interesting opportunity of observing the resources of the collateral circulation. The course of the anastomosing vessels, by which the blood is brought from the upper to the lower part of the artery, will be found well described in an account of two cases in the Pathological Transactions, vols. viii. and x. In the former (p. 162), Mr. Sydney Jones thus sums up the detailed description of the anastomosing vessels. 'The principal communi- cations by which the circulation was carried on, wereâ€”Firstly, the internal mammary, anastomosing with the intercostal arteries, with the phrenic of the abdominal aorta by j means of the musculo-phrenic and comes nervi phrenici, and largely with the deep epigastric.

NERVES OF TYMPANUM. 739 The TYMPANIC BRANCH OF THK GL0S«0-1'HARYNGEAL NERVE J^,^,] (W'^. 235,- ; nerve of Jucobsou, p. 108) enters a special aperture in the temporal bone (tig. 230, ct), to reach the inner wall of the tym- supplies panum. In this cavity the nerve supplies iilaments to the lining ,„e,iii>niiu', niiMnbrane, to the fenestra rotunda and fenestra ovalis, and to the Eustachian tube ; and it terminates in the tliree undermentioned and otiier branches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and ^"^^ connect this nerve with others. Branches. One branch is arched forwards and downwards, and one to sym- enters the carotid canal to communicate with the sympathetic (•') P''^*'"'-*'""' on the artery (p. 114). The second (■') is the small deep petrosal nerve, which is dh-ected small deeii forwards through a canal beneath the cochleariform process, to join uervc!' the carotid jilexus of the sympathetic (sometimes also the large superficial petrosal nerve) in the foramen laceruni. And the third (^) has the following course :—It ascends in front and small (jf the fenestra ovalis, and iiear the gangliform enlargement on the petrosal'*' facial nerve, to which it is connected by filaments (fig. 35).

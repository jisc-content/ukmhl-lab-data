DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 194 Bupcrlicial iircifonii llbi-es. Internal structure of medulla oblongata. On tlie anterior surface of the medulla ol)longata there may be seen, more or less distinctly in different subjects, a set of fibres crossing transversely over the upper half of the pyramid and the olivary body. These are the superficial arciform filrres, and thc-y pass externally into the restiform body. Structube. The fibres of the several columns of the spinal cord enter the medulla o]:)longata below, where they undergo a partial re-arrangement, and are partly continued onwards to the cerebrum and cerel)elluni, being joined by other fibres Avhich take theii" origin in the medulla, and partly end in the gi-ey substance of the medulla. The course of the filjres can only be shown to a very small extent by dissection, and for the complete study of the Fig. 56.* arrangement of the fibres, as well as of the grey matter, it is necessary f to examine sections of different parts of the medulla oblongata. Dissection Dissection. To expose the connection of the pyi-amid with thej pyranSd spinal cord, let the student turn outwards on the left side, as in fig. I 56, the small part of the anterior column of the cord that remainsi below the decussation (for the cord has been cut through near this),| and the pyramid of the right side will then be seen to diyide belowd into two parts, one passing directly into the anterior column, andi( the other crossing the median fissure and disappearing in the oppp-ij site half of the cord. * Superficial dissection of the medulla oblongata and pons. a.

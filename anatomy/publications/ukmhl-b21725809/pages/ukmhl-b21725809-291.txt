275 BRACHIAL ARTERY. with fasciae and muscles, its situation is indicated by the surface-depression along the mner border of the biceps and coraco-brachialis muscles. ^ . , , . Throughout the arm the brachial artery is superficial, being Roiations^^ covered only by the integuments and the deep fascia ; but at the bend of the elbow it becomes deeper, and i^ig-^i- is crossed by the pro- longation from the tendon of the biceps. Posteriorly the artery has the following mus- cular connections (fig. 82) :â€”While it is in- side the humerus it is placed over the long head of the triceps (f) for two inches, but separated partly by the musculo-spiral nerve and profunda vessels ; and over the inner bead (g) of the same muscle for about an inch and a half. But when the vessel passes to the front of the bone, it lies on the insertion of the coraco- brachialis (c) and on the brachialis anticus (h). To the outer side are the coraco-brachia- lis and biceps muscles (c and b), the latter overlapping it. Veins. Vense comites lie along the sides of the artery (fig. 82, d), encircling it witli cross branches, and the me- dian-basilic vein crosses over it at the elbow. The basilic vein is near the artery, on the inner side, above ; but it is superficial to the fascia in the lower half of the arm. * Axillary and brachial arteries. (Quain's "Arteries.") 1. Axillary artery and branches : the small branch above the figure is the superior thoracic, and the larger branch close below, the acrornio-thoracic. 2, Long thoracic. 3. Subscapular. 4. Jh'achial artery. 5. Superior profunda branch. 6. Inferior profunda. 7. Anastomotic. 8. Biceps muscle. 9. Triceps muscle. The median and ulnar nerves are shown in the arm ; the median is close to the brachial artery. T 2 with veins,

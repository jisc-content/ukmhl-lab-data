712 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. motion liniitud. Union of the pluilangcs. synovial sac. Form of bones. Kind of motion, movement of bone, state of ligaments. licacl of tlie metatarsal bone, is least impeded in tlie gi-eat toe joint ; but these movements in the foot are not so free as in the hun(L Articulations of the phalanges. There are two inteii:)hu- langeal joints to each toe, except the first. Ligaments similar to those in the metatarso-phalangeal joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior, are to be recognized in these urticulationf<. The joint between the last two phalanges is lea.st distinct; and often- times the small bones are immoveably united by osseous substance. These ligaments receive a more particular notice Mdth the dissection of the hand (p. 327). A simple synovial membrane exists in. each phalangeal articulation. Articular surfaces. In both phalangeal joints, the nearer phalanx presents a trochlear surface ; and the distal one is marked by two lateral hollows or cups with a median ridge. Movement. Only flexion and extension are permitted in the two phalangeal joints of the toes, as in the hand. \n flexion farther phalanx glides under the nearer; and in extension the two are brought into a straight line. The bending is checked by the lateral ligaments and the extensor tendon; and the straightening is limited by the inferior L'gament and the flexor tendons.

VISCERAL PLEXUSES OF SYMPATHETIC. 4S3 on the vessels, viz., superior mesenteric, aortic, spermatic, and in- thetie to the fcrior mesenteric, ai-e derived from the solar plexus beneath the ^'^ • stomach. The remaining portion of the sympathetic nerve in the abdomen will be subsequently referred to (p. 491). Dissection. On the two mesenteric arteries the dissector will have Dissection already made out the plexuses of nerves distributed to the intes- tinal tube beyond the duodenum. He has now to trace on the aorta the connecting nerves between aortic ^^^^ the mesenteric plexuses, by taking the peritoneum from the aorta P^^'^"^' below the pancreas. From the upper part of the aortic plexus an offset is to be followed along the spermatic artery ; this may be done on the left side, where the vessel is partly laid bare. By detacliing the peritoneum below tlie bifurcation of the aorta, hypogastric and follo-fting downwards over the iliac arteries the nerves from the P^®^^^''- aortic plexus and the lumbar ganglia, the dissector will arrive at the hypogastric i:)lexus, above the promontory of the sacrum. The suverior mesenteric plexus is a large bundle of nen^es, and is Superior • iiiGscuttiric distributed to the same extent of the intestinal tube as the mesenteric piexus artery. The nerves surround closely the trunk and larger branches is on artery of the artery ; but near the intestine some of them leave the vessels, ^[^^^^ and divide and communicate before entering the gut. The offsets secondary ■ of the main plexus are named after the arteries which they accom- plexuses, pany, viz., intestinal nerves to the small intestine, and ileo-colic, right colic, and middle colic plexuses to the large intestine. The aortic plexus is an open network of nerves covering the aorta Aortic • TJiBXiis is below the superior mesenteric artery; it is stronger on the sides between than the front of the aorta, in consequence of its recei^dug acces- "rteries^-"' sory branches from the lumbar ganglia, especially the left. Above, the plexus derives an offset, on each side of the aorta, from the solar and renal plexuses. It ends below, on each side, in branches offsets, wliich cross the common iliac artery, and enter the hypogastric plexus. From it off'sets are furnished to the spermatic and inferior mesenteric arteries. The spermat ic plexus, formed by roots from both the aortic and the Spermatic renal plexus, runs on the spermatic artery to the testicle; in the cord i'^'^'^"'* • it joins other filaments on the vas deferens. In the female, the nerves on the ovarian (spermatic) artery are in female, furnished to the ovary and the uterus. The inferior mesenteric plexus supplies the part of the intestinal inferior tube to which its artery is distributed. This plexus is furnished piext!^*!'"" Irom the left side of the aortic plexus ; and the nerves composing it are whiter and larger than in either of the preceding plexuses of the sympathetic. Near the sigmoid flexure the branching of the nerves join nerves and the imion of contiguous twigs are well marked. Its offsets ves*seis'^- (plexuses) are left colic, sigmoid, and superior hsemorrhoidal: they secondary ramify on those arteries, and have a like distribution. l>iexusos. The Kypo(jastric plexus, or the large preverteljral centre for the Hypogastric supply of sympathetic nerves to the viscera of the pelvis, is situate ^'^^^"^^' in front of the last lumbar vertebra. It is formed by the union of ^'^^'^^ion; the prolongations of the aortic plexus; and the nerves composing it • I I '2

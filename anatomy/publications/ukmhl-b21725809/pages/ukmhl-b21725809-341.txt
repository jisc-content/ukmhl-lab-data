325 CAfiPO-METACARPAL ARTICULATIONS. Fig. 99. bone is brought in front of the palm; and as tlie movement proceeds, the thumb is gradually tm-ned towards the fingers, passing into the state of (ypposition. In this way the thumb may be made to touch and opposi- the palmar surface of any or all of the fingers, the phalanges of the ' latter being somewhat bent at the same time. Extension of the extending; joint is fi-ee, and by it the metacarpal bone is removed from the palm towards the outer border of the forearm. Abduction and adduction. By these movements the thimib is .and lateral placed in contact with, or removed from the fore finger. The metacarpal hones of the fingers receive longitudinal bands from Joints of the carpal bones on both aspects, thus :â€” ^^^^^ The dorsal ligavients (fig. 99) are two to each, except to the bone have dorsal' of the little finger. The bands of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger come from the trapezium and tra- pezoid ; those of the third metacarpal are attached to the trajjezoid and os mag- num; the bone of the ring finger receives its bands from the os magnum and unciform ; and to the fifth metacai-pal bone there is but one ligament from the imci- form. The palmar ligaments (fig. 96), usually one to each metacarpal bone, are weaker and less constant than the dorsal. These liga- ments may be obKque in direction ; and sometimes a band is divided between two, as in the case of a ligament passing from the trapeziimi to the second and third metacarpals. One or more may be wanting. On the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone of the middle digit is lateral band, a longitudinal lateral hand, which is attached above to the os mag- num and unciform, and below to a rough part on the inner side of the base of the above mentioned bone. Sometimes this band isolates the articulation of the last two metacarpals with the unciform bone from the remaining carpo-metacarpal joint; but more frequently it is divided into two parts, and does not form a complete partition. This band may be seen by opening from behind the articulation between the imciform and the last two metacarpal bones ; and by cutting through the transverse ligaments joining the third and fourth metacarpals so as to allow their separation.

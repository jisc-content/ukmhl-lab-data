On the riolit side the psoas is to be left untouched, in o^rder that the place oVen.ergence fL it of the different offsets of the plexus "YhmTk Spinal Nekves. The anterior primary branches of the lumbar nerves enter the lumbar plexus, with the exception of the j,,exus last. Five in number, they increase in size from Fig. 167.* above down, and are joined by filaments of the sympathetic near the intervertebral fora- mina. Before entering the plexus, they supply branches to the psoas <and quadratus lumborum muscles. The fifth nerve (fig. 173) receives a commu- nicating branch from the fourth, and is to be fol- lowed into the pelvis to its junction with the sacral plexus. After the two are united, the name lumbosacral cord is ap- • plied to the common trunk. The LUMBAR PLEXUS (fig. 167) is formed by the intercommunication of the first four lumbar nerves. Contained in the substance of the psoas, near the posterior surface, it consists of commimicating loops be- tween the several nerves, and increases in size from above downwards, like the individual nerves. Superiorly it is sometimes united by a small branch with the last dorsal nerve : connections . • witli Ticrvcs. find inferiorly it joins the sacral plexus through the large lumbo- sacral cord.

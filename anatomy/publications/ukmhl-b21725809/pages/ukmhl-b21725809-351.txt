335 RELATIONS OF LUNGS. The outer surface of the lung is convex, and is in contact with Extcnuii the wall of the thorax : a large cleft divides it into two parts, and ' on the right side there is a second smaller fissure. The hmev sur- internal face is flat when compared with the outer: at the fore part is a large lioUow which lodges the heart and great vessels, and is most marked on the left lung; and behind> ^ this is a fissure about three s/j^Â®^^''',^^^'^" 7-()0t.. Fig. 101, inches long, hilum pulmonis, which receives the vessels of the root of the lung. Each lung is divided into two lobes by an obliq[ue fissure, wliicli pivisou begins at the posterior border near the apex, and ends at the fore part of the base ; and the lower lobe is larger than the upper. ^^^^ In the right lung a second horizontal fissure is dii-ected forwards . iiiid tlic from the middle of the oblique one to the anterior border, and cuts righ off a small triangular piece from the upper lobe : this is the third or middle lobe. Occasionally there may l)e a trace of the third lobe in the left lung. Besides the dift'erence in the number of the lobes, the right lung Differonce is larger and heavier, and is wider and more hollowed out at the s"ze of'tije"'^ base, as well as being somewhat shorter than the left. The increased length and the narrowness of the left lung are due to the absence of a large projecting body like the liver below it, and to the direction of the heart to the left side. * Diagram to show the difference in the anterior border of the right and left lung, the edge being indicated by the dark line : and to mark the diflferent level of the base on tlie two sides.

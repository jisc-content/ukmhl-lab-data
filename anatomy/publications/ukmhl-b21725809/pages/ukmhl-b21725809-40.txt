DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 24 adjoining muscles. In the upper lip it is attached, on each side of the middle line, by one slip (naso-labial) to tlie back of the septum lixwl tonoso of the nostrils (fig. 5, and by a thin stratum to the outer surface and to jaw- ., > Â® ' ^ ., , bones. oi upper jaw, opposite the canine tooth, and external to the depressor of the wing of the nose. In the lower lip it is fixed on each side to the inferior jawbone, opposite the canine tooth, external to the levator menti muscle. To see these attachments the lip must be everted, and the mucous membrane carefully raised. Relations. 'Yh.e inner margin of the muscle is free, and Isounds the aperture of the mouth ; while the outer edge blends with the different muscles that elevate or depress the lips and the angle of the mouth. Beneath the orbicularis in each lip is the coronary artery, with the mucous membrane and the labial glands. Use of both Action.

Inner alone. The inner fibres acting alone will turn inwards the red part of the lip, and diminish the width of the oral opening. Outer alone. The outer fibres press the lips against the dental arches, the fr^e edges being protruded and somewhat everted. At the same time * 1. Frontalis nuiscle. 4. Occipitalis. 2. Orbicularis palpebrarum. 3.

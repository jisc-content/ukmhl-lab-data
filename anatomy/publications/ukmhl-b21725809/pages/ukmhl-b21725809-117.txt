INFEAOrvBITAL ARTERY. 101 the ti'Ctli, after fovining loops of commiuncation with one another, anil with the posterior dental nerve. From the middle branch lilaiuents ai^e given to the bicuspid teeth ; and from the anterior to the canine and incisors, as well as a twig or two to the inferior meatus of the nose. /. Tlie palpebral hunches are usually two small twigs which turn to lower upwards round the margin of the infraorbital foramen to reach the ^^^^^'^' lower lid. a. The lateral nasal branches are directed inwards, and supply t" side of H0S6 * the skin of the side of the nose. h. The labial branches, three or four in number, are larger than and to upper the others, and descend to the lip, supplying the skin of the face ^'P' Fig. 25.* between the orbit and the mouth, as well as the mucous membrane of the upper lip. Their ramifications are crossed by, and com- joining municate with the infraorbital branches of the facial nerve, the whole forming the infraorbital plexus (p. 38). The INFRAORBITAL ARTERY is a branch of the internal maxUlary infraorbital (p. 89). Taking the course of the nerve tlirough the infraorbital '"^^'^^^T canal, tlie vessel appears on the face beneath the elevator muscle of the upper lip ; and it ends in branches which are distributed, like those of the nerve, between the eye and mouth. On the face ends in its branches anastomose with offsets of the facial and buccal arteries. In the canal in the maxilla the artery furnishes small ^^1^Â°^^^ twigs to the orbit, and a larger anterior dental branch which rims and one to with the nerve of the same name to the incisor and canine teeth : teettf the dental branch also gives offsets to the antrum, and near the teeth it anastomoses with the posterior dental artery. The vein accompanying the artery communicates in front with infraorbital the fficial vein, and terminates behind in the alveolar plexus (p. 89). * Diagram of the superior maxillary nerve. 2.

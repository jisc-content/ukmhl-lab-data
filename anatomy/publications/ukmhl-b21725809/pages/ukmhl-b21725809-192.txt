176 DISSECTION OP THE NECK, To fix The transverse lifiament of the atlas (fig. 50, ') is a strong arched vvool^ss'^ ^'^^^^^ behind thft odontoid ijrocess, whicli is attaclied on eacfi side to imnsvcrs ^ tubercle on the inner suiface of the lateral mass of the atlas, below liliinentr ^^^^ P''^'''^ °^ ^U'P^^' articular process. The ligament is rounded at each end, but flattened and wider in the nuddle ; and at this spot also named it has a band of longitudinal fibres connected with its upper and cmcifonn. i^^y^^ margins (fig. 49, ^) so as to produce a cruciform figui-e : the upper band is inserted into the basilar process, and the lower into the body of the axis. Towards the spinal canal it is concealed hy the long occipito-axial ligament. Socket for odontoid process. Check ligaments. Suspensory ligament. Articular surfaces of odontoid process, and two synovial sacs. Occipito- atlantal articula- tions are condyloid joints. This ligament forms, with the anterior arch of the atlas, a ling (fig. 50, ^) which siuTOunds the neck of the odontoid process of the axis, and prevents separation of the bones. The lateral odontoid or check ligaments (fig. 49, ^) are two strong bundles of fibres, attached by one end to a flat impression on each side of the head of the odontoid j)rocess, and by the other to a rough mark on the inner surface of the condyle of the occijntal bone. These ligaments are covered by the long occipito-axial band: their upper fibres are short and nearly horizontal; the lower are longer and oblique. The central odontoid ligament is a small median cord, which 13asses from the tip of the odontoid process to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. When the transverse and odontoid ligaments have been cut through, the odontoid process will be seen to have two cartilage- covered surfaces, which correspond to as many synovial sacs. One surface is on the front of the process, and articulates with the anterior arch of the atlas ; the other is the floor of the groove laehind the neck of the process, and is in contact with the transverse ligament. The posterior synovial sac is larger than the anterior. Occipito-atlcmtal articulations. A synovial joint is formed between the condyle of the occij^ital bone and the ujiper articular process of the atlas on each side. Surrounding the articulation is a capsular ■ ligament of scattered fibres, which is strongest externally and in i * Atlas witli the odontoid process removed from tlie ring formed by the ■ bone and the transverse ligament. 1, Transveree ligamcut with its oifsets • cut. 2.

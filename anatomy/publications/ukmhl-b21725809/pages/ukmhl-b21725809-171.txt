155 EXTERXAL MUSCLES OF LAEYNX. Km iiich from the middle line ; as well as for a short distance iinto the inner surface of that cartilage. The muscle rests on the icrico-thyroid membrane, and is concealed by the sterno-thyroid nnuscle. Action. It draws the cricoid cartilage upwards and backwards, so Use. Bs to increase the distance between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages, and thus tightens the vocal cords. Fig. 39.* Fig- 40.t The POSTERIOR CRICO-ARTTENOID MUSCLE (fig. 40, c) arises from Posterio Ithe depression by the side of the vertical ridge at the back of the ar'^°"jjoi^^ cricoid cartilage. From this origin the fibres are directed out- on back of • • • • 1 cricoicL wards and upwards, converging to their insertion into the mus- cartilage, cular process at the outer side of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Action. It draws the arytenoid cartilage downwards and outwards Use. to a slight extent, separating this from the one of the opposite side ; Ibut its principal action is to rotate the cartilage, turning outwards •the vocal process, and thus dilating the glottis.

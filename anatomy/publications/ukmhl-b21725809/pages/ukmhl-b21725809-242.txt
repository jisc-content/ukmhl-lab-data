226 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. Aqueduct of Sylvius. Three sets of fibres in cerebral hemisphere Ascending fibres : The aqueduct of Sylvius (iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum) is a narrow passage, about five-eighths of an inch long, uniting the third and fourth ventricles. It is lined by ependyma, external to which is a layer of grey matter continuous with that of the floor of the two cavities. Fibres of the cerebrum. In the cerebral hemispheres three systems of fibres are distinguished, viz., ascending, transverse, and longitudinal. The ascending are derived in large part from the spinal cord and the lower portions of the encephalon; the transverse and longitudinal connect together parts of the cerebrum. Ascending ov 2xduncular fibres {p.^. 67). The longitudinal fibres entering the mid-brain from the pons are collected into two sets, which are contained respectively in the crusta and the tegmentum, thoir origin. In this region they are reinforced by the superior peduncles of the cerebellum, and by fibres derived from the corpora quadrigemina, as well as hj others springing from the grey nuclei of the crura. The fibres of the crusta enter the internal capsiile ; and while some (including the pyramidal tract) are continued without interrui^tion through this into the medullary centre of the hemisphere, others pass into the lenticular and caudate nuclei, and fi'esh fibres are Fibres of crusta, and of added from those bodies.

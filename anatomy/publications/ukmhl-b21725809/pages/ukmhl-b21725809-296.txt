DISSECTION OF THE ARM. 280 Relations of tho muscle. Use. Two inter- muscular septa : .in niurr ancV an outer. Dissection of vessels and nerve. The triceps is superficial, except ut the uj^per part where it is overlapped by the deltoid miiscle. It lies ou the humerus, and conceals the musculo-spiral nerve, the supeiior profunda vessels, and the articxdation of the elbow. On the sides the muscle i» united to the intermuscidar septa ; and the lower fibres are con- tinuous externally mth the anconeus—a muscle of the forearm. Action. ALL the pieces of the triceps combining in their action will bring the ulna into a Une P'g- 83.* with the humeiOLS, and extend the elbow-joint. As the long head passes the shoulder, it can depress the raised humerus, and adduct, the bone to the thorax. The INTERMUSCULAR SEPTA an filjrous processes continuous witli the investing aponeurosis of tlie arm, which are fixed to the ridges leading to the condyles of the humerus : they intervene between the muscles on the front and back of the limb, and give attachment to the fleshy filjres. The internal is the stronger, and reaches as high as the cora- co-brachialis muscle, from wliich it receives some tendinous fibres. The brachialis anticus is attached to it in front, and the tricejj- behind ; and the uhiar nerve, and the inferior j^rofunda and anas- tomotic vessels pierce it. The external septum is thinner, and ceases at the deltoid muscle. Behind it is the triceps ; and in front are the brachialis anticus, and the muscles of the forearm (sxij)inator longus and extensor carj)i radialis longior) arising above the condyle of the humerus : it is pierced by the musculo-spiral nerve and the accompanying vessels. Dissection. To follow the sajDerior profunda vessels and the mus- culo-spiral nerve, the middle head of the triceps should be cut across * Dissection of the dorsal scapular vessels and nerve, and of tlic triceps muscle. Muscles: a. Long head of triceps, b. Outer head, with a bit of whalebone beneath it to mark the extent of its attachment down the humerus. 0. Inner head. d. Anconeus, e. Supinator longus. p. Extensor carpi radialis longior. o. Teres major. H. Teres minor, i. Infraspinatus, cut across. J. Supraspiuatus, cut through. Artm'ks: a. Suprascapular. h. Dorsal scapular, c. Posterior circumflex.

210 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. How to seo them. Calloso- luarginal sulcus. Dissection. The jmrts to be no^v described can only be seen satisfactorily on a separate hemisphere ; but if the student possesses only the one brain, he may show much of the inner surface Ijy cutting off the left hemisphere as low as the corpus callosum. Sulci. The calloso-marginal sulcus (cm) begins below the rostrum of the corpus callosum, and arches upAvards, following the curve of the fore part of that body. It is then directed backwards a.s far as Parieto- occipital fissure. Calcariiie fissure. the posterior extremity of the corpus callosum, where it bends uj)- wards and ends by notching the superior margin of the hemisphere (fig. 60, cm). Its fore part is frequently interrupted by one or two small gyri uniting the adjacent convolutions. The 'parieto-occi'pital ov perpendicular fissure (fig. 62, po) is a deep cleft which descends from the upper margin of the hemisphere at the back part, with a slight inclination forwards, to join the follow- ing sulcus on a level with the hinder end of the corpus callosum. The calcarine fissure (c) is nearly horizontal. It begins close to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere, and is directed foi-wai-ds, receiving the parieto-occipital fissure about the middle of its length, to end a little below the splenium of the corpus callosum. It gives rise to the eminence called calcar avis in the lateral A'^entricle, whence its name. * Sulci and convolutions of the inner aspect of the hemisphere. Suld: cm. Calloso-marginal. po.

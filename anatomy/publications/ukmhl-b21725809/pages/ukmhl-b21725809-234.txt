DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 218 Pia matev enters it. and by the optic tlialaiiius and crus cerebri on the other. A fold of pia mater (vekim interpositum) projects into the transverse fissure beneath the fornix (fig. 64, g), and fonns lateral fringes- Pis. 64.* the choroid plexuses, which appear in the ventricle along the margin of the slit. In the natural state the fissiu'e is sej^arated from the cavity of the ventricle by the epithelium of the ej^endyma being continued over the choroid plexus. The student is now to return to the examination of the parts in the centre of the brain, viz., the fold of pia mater and its vessels, with the third ventricle. Afterwards the corpus striatum and optic thalamus will be studied. The velum interpositum (fig. 64, y) is the fold of pia mater entering the great transverse fissure. Triangular in shape, it has the same extent as the body of the fornix, and reaches in front to the foramen of Monro. The upper surface is in contact with the fornix, to which it supj^lies vessels. The lower surface, looking to ventricle"'the thii'd ventricle, covers the pineal body and a part of each optic * Second view of the dissection of the brain, the fornix being cut through in front and raised.

314 DISSECTION OF UPPER LIMB. arterie of ^' Small dorsal arteries of the tlmmb (c) arise opposite the thumb metacarpal bone, along which they extend, one on each border, to be distributed on its posterior aspect, and fore (I. The dorsal branch of the index finger is distributed on the radial ''"S"'- edge of that digit. Sheaths of The diiferent divisions of the annular ligament may be seen more iTgameut completely by cutting the sheaths of the ligament over the several tendons passing beneath. There are six separate compartments, from with- and each is lubricated by a synovial membrane. The most ex- out inwards, ^^^^^i lodges the first two extensors of the thumb. The next is a large hollow for the two radial extensors of the wrist ; and a small space for the extensor of the second phalanx of the thmnb follows on the ulnar side. Farther to the ianer side is the common sheath for the extensor of the fingers, and that of the fore finger; and then comes a slender compartment for the extensor of the little Bones finger. Internal to all is the sj)ace for the extensor carpi ulnaris. the*^enclons. The last muscle grooves the ulna ; but the others lie in hollows in the radius in the order mentioned above, with the exception of the extensor minimi digiti which is situate between the bones.

Dissection of externiil ligaments of slioulder. Shoulder- joint, outline of. Directions. The ligaments of the articulatious of the limb, wliich are still moist, may be examined at once ; but if any of them have become dry, they may be softened by immersion in water, or with a wet cloth, while the student leariis the others. Dissection. For the preparation of the external ligaments of the shoulder-jomt the tendons of the surrounding muscles, viz., sub- scapularis, supraspiuatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor, must be detached from the capsule ; and as these are united with it, some care will be needed not to open the joint. The Shoulder-Joint. This ball and socket joint (tig. 93) is formed between the head of the humerus and the glenoid fossa of the

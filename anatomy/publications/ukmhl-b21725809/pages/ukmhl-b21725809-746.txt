In most cases the outer wall of the tympanic portion of the canal is partly formed by fibrous tissue. The aperture by which the tendon of the muscle escapes is placed a little above and in front of the fenestra ovaHs. The outer boundary of the cavity is formed by the membrana tympani (fig. 230, c), and the surrounding bone.

NERVES IN BASE OF SKULL. 17 sphenoidal fissure, it sinks beloAV tlie fourtli and a part of tlic fifth, and divides into two branches. Near the orbit the nerve is joined by one or two delicate fila- passes to ments from the cavernous plexus (p. 20). The FOURTH or trochlear nerve (fig. 4,") courses forwards to one Fourth muscle in the orbit. It is the smallest of the cranial nerves, and Fig. 4.* pierces the dura mater at the free edge of the tentorium, close behind the posterior clinoid process. In the wall of the sinus it in the wall lies below the third; but as it is about to pass through the °^ sphenoidal fissure it rises higher than all the other nerves. While in the wall of the sinus the fourth nerve is joined by- twigs of the sympathetic ; and it is sometimes connected with the ophthalmic trunk of the fifth. Fifth or trifacial nerve (fig, 4, '^). This nerve is distributed Fifth nerve to the face and head, and consists of two parts or roots—a large or J-'oots^^" sensory, and a small or motor. The large root of the nerve passes through an aperture in the Large root * Cranial nerves in the base of the skull. On the left side the dura mater has been removed from the middle fossa to show the nerves in the wall of the cavernous sinus, the Gasserian ganglion, and the three trunks of the fifth nerve. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

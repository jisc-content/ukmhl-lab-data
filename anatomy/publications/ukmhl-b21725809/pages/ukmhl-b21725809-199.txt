183 VERTEBRAL AND BASILAR ARTERIES. cl The inferior cerehellar artery (posterior, arises from tlie end of tlie vertebral (sometimes from tlie basilar), and winds backwards cerebelUun, round the medulla oblongata, between the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, to the median groove of the cerebellum. Directed onwards in tlie sulcus between the hemisphere and the inferior vermiform process, the arteiy reaches the hinder ^ margin of the small brain, and there anastomoses with the superior cere- bellar artery. An offset of this branch ramifies over the imder part of the offsets, cerebellar hemisphere, and ends externally by anastomosing with the Fig. 52.* artery of the upper surface. As the vessel passes by the side of the fourth ventricle, it gives a small choroid branch to the plexus of that cavity. The BASILAR ARTERY ("), formed by the union of the two verte- Basilar brals, reaches from the lower to the upper border of the pons, where ^^^^y> it ends by di\'iding into two branches (posterior cerebral) for the ^^^^^^ ^"^ cerebrimi. The vessel lies in the median groove of the pons, rest- situation, ing against the body of the sphenoid bone. On each side of, and almost parallel to it is the sixth nerve. Branches. Besides the two terminal branches mentioned above. Branches: the artery siipplies transverse offsets to the pons and the fore part of the cerebellum, and a large branch to the upper surface of the cerebellum. a. The transverse arteries of the pons are four or five small twigs, transverse to tlie lions; * Arteries at the base of the brain. 1. Internal carotid trunk. 2. Anterior cerebral. 3.

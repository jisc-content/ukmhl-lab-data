Lastly, the fibres of the muscle are to be detached at their origin ; ™yo and thJ inner piece may be removed entirely by cutting through « ■ 636 the vessels and nerves that enter it. In doing this the sacral nerves ""J ^secl are to be dissected out of the fleshy fibres, and to be followed to the nerves, surface of the great sacro-sciatic ligament, where they will be after- wards seen. * Second view of the dissection of the buttock (Illustrations of Dissections).

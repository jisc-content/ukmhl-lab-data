503 STRUCTURE OF THE COLON. The longitudinal fibres may be traced as a thin layer over the longitudinal surface, but most are collected into three longitudinal bands, about band's, a ([uarter of an inch in width. On the vermiform api^endix the which are fibres form a uniform layer; but they are continued thence into ^'^^Jpg^^^j?" the bands on the caecum and colon : on the rectum they are dif- and rec- fused over the surface. When the bands are divided the intestine ■ elongates,—the sacculi and the ridges in the interior of the gut disappearing at the same time. The circular fibres are spread over the whole surface, but are and circular, most marked in the folds projecting into the intestine. In the rectum (to be afterwards seen) they form the band of the internal sphincter muscle. The fibrous or submucous coat resembles that of the small intestine.

The mucous coat, which may be examined on opening the intes- Mucous coat tine, is smooth, and of a pale yelloAv colour ; and it is not thrown joids*"'^*' into special folds, except in the rectmn. The surface is free from villi; and by this circumstance the mucous membrane of the large and villi, can be distinguished from that of the smaU. intestine. This differ- ence in the two portions of the alimentary tube is well marked on the ileo-csecal valve ; for the surface looking to the ileum is studded with -villi, while the surface continuous with the mucous lining of the large intestine is free from those eminences. Glands. The mucous membrane is thickly beset with very small Tubular tubular glands or crypts of LieberhUhn, like those of the small intes- stands, tine ; and lymphoid nodules (solitary glands) are scattered over the and lym- whole of the large intestine, but are most abundant in the csecum duie^.""" and vermiform appendix.

THE PANCREAS. The pancreas (fig. 149, e) is a narrow flattened gland, from six Form and to eight inches in length, and larger at the right than the left end. ^^^^^^' It is divided into head, tail, and body. divisions. The liead, or the right extremity, occupies the concavity of the The head duodenum ; and the left extremity, or the tail, is rounded, and ' touches the spleen. The body of the gland measures about one inch and a half in and the breadth, and from half an inch to an inch in thickness. The rela- tions of the pancreas to surrounding parts are described at p. 486. Dissection. Let the pancreas be placed on the anterior surface. Trace out and let the excretory duct be traced from the head to the tail by cutting away the substance of the gland. The duct will be recog- nised by its whiteness. Structdre.

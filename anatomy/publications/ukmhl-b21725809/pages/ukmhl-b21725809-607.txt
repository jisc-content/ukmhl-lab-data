Q Q IJ^TEliPUBlC DISC. Dissection. The disc will be best seen by making a transverse ^j^^,*!*.^^ section of tlie bones, Avliicb -will show the disposition of the anterior ligament of the articulation, and the thickness of the plate, with its toothed mode of attachment to the bone ; and when another oppor- 1 unity offei"s, a vertical section may be made. The interpubic disc consists of a layer of cartilage on each side, interpubH; w hich is firmly adherent to the ridged surface of the bone, and a tibrous portion in the centi'e. The fibrous part is thickest in front; and at the iijjper and back portion of the symphysis there is cleft in it. generally a fissure, produced by the absorj^tion of the fibrous sub- stance. In some bodies the fissure extends through the whole of the disc, so as to divide it completely into two. The thin obturator membrane (fis;. 186, b) closes almost Obtiu^ator entirely the thyroid foramen, and is composed of fibres crossing in closes an different directions. It is attached to the bony margin of the fora- f^f^^,^*' men, except above where the obturator vessels pass through ; and â– it the lower and inner jjart of the aperture it is connected to the pelvic aspect of the hip-bone. The surfaces of the ligament give attachment to the obturator muscles. Branches of the obturator A'essels perforate it.

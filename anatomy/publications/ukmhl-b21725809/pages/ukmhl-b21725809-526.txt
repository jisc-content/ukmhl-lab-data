It is pear-shaped, and its larger end (fundus) is directed forwards beyond the margin of the liver; while the smaller end (neck) is turned in the opposite direction, and bends downwards to terminate in the cystic duct by a zigzag part. In length the gall-bladder measures thi'ee or four inches, and in breadth rather more than an inch at the widest part. It holds from an ounce to an ounce and a half. By one surface it is in contact with the liver, and on the opposite it is covered by peritoneum. The larger end touches the abdominal wall opposite the cartilage- of the ninth rib (fig. 144, gb), where it is con- tiguous to the transverse colon ; and the small end is in contact with the duodenum. Structure. The gall-bladder possesses a peri- toneal, a fibrous and muscular, and a mucous coat. The serous coat is stretched over the under or free surface of the gall-bladder, and surrounds the large end. The fibrous coat is strong, and forms the framework of the sac ; intermixed with it are some involuntary muscular fibres, the chief being longitudinal, but others circular. The mucous coat is marked internally by numerous ridges and intervening depressions^ which give an alveolar or honeycomb appear- ance to the surface. On laying open the gall- bladder this condition will be seen, wath the aid of a lens, to be most developed about the centre of the sac, and to diminish towards each ex- tremity. In the bottom of the larger pits are dejiressions leading to recesses. Where the gall-bladder ends in the cystic duct (fig. 161) its coats project into the interior, and give rise to ridges resembling those in the sacculated large intestine.

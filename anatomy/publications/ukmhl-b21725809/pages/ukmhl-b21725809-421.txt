To remove the spinal cord with the sheath of the dura mater from the body, the lateral processes in the intervertebral cord, Fig. 124.* Fig. 125.t foramina, -vvith the contained nerves, are to be cut; and one or two of them in the dorsal region should be followed outwards beyond the apertures by cutting away the surrounding bone. The central prolongation may be now detached from the coccyx; and the cord and its membranes are to be divided opposite the fourth cervical * Lower end of the dura mater with its central and lateral processes.

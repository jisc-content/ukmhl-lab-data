247 BOUNDAEIES OF AXILLA. muscles passing from the trunk to the upper limb. In the anterior wall are the two pectoral muscles, but these take unequal shares in its construction, in consequence of the difference in their size :— thus the pectoralis major (a) extends over the whole front of the in front, space, reaching from the clavicle to the edge of the anterior fold ; while the pectoralis minor (b) corresponds only to about the middle third of the wall. In the posterior boundary, from above down- and bebiud; wards, lie the sixbscapularis (f), the latissinius dorsi muscle (d), and Fig. 72.* the teres major (e) : the free margin, of this boundary, wliich is formed by the latissimus dorsi and teres major, is thicker and more prominent, especially near the arm, than the anterior. On the inner side of the axilla lie the first five ribs, with their on the intervening intercostal muscles, and the part of the serratus magnus ^"'^ ■ (c) taking origiii from those bones. On the outer side the space o'lter sides; has but small dimensions, and is limited by the humerus and the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles (g and h).

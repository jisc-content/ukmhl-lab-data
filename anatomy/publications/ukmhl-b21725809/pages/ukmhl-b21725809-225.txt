OUTER CEREBEAL CONVOLUTIONS. 209 of the Sylvian fissure, and ends by joining the superior temporo- sphenoidal convolution. The angular convolution {Aug) arises from the hinder part of the and^angular foregoing, arches over the upper end of the parallel sulcus (s<), and tions. descends behind that furrow to be continued into the middle teniporo- sphenoidal convolution : it is joined behind to tlie middle occipital convolution by the second annectant gyi'us (behind Ang). Sulci and convolutions of the occipital lobe. The ^^j'^^t^^^j occipital lobe is divided into three convolutions, Avhich run forwards convolu- from the posterior extremity of the hemisphere, by two small g^pg^oj" furrows—the superior and middle occipital sulci. The superior niicUlle, and occipital convolution (so) is united anteriorly to the superior parietal lobule by the fii-st annectant gyrus ; the middle (mo) to the angular convolution by the second, and to the middle temporo-sphenoidal coTvol^"* convolution by the third annectant gyri; and the inferior (lo) to tions. the lower temporo-sphenoidal convolution by the fourth annectant gyrus. An inconstant inferior occipital sulcus, at the lower margin of the hemisphere, separates the third occipital convolution from the external occipito-temporal of the under surface. The occipital convolu- tions are very variable, and the sulci are frequently ill marked. Sulci and convolutions op the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. Temporo- Three longitudinal sulci limit as many convolutions in this lobe. sufci""^'^'^^ The superior temporo-sphenoidal or parallel sulcus (si) is Avell upper marked, and runs below and parallel to the posterior brancli of the °^ P''^^'^^^^^' fissure of Sylvius, from near the anterior extremity of the lobe, backwards and upwards, into the inferior parietal lobule. The middle tempm-o-sphenoidal sulcus (^mt) takes a similar course at a middle, and lower level, but it is not so constant as the superior ; and the inferior (fig. 62, it), which is also very variable, is placed on the inferior, imder surface of the hemisphere near the margin, separating the lower temporo-sphenoidal from the external occipito-temporal convolution. The superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution (inframarginal; st) ^jg^J"',"" forms the lower boundary of the posterior branch of the Sylvian also tiu-ee. fissure, and is continuous behind with the supramarginal convolu- tion. The middle and inferior temporo-sp)henoid(d convolutions (mt and it) are conmionly tinited in some part of their extent. The posterior end of the middle one is joined by the angular and third annectant gyri. The inferior forms the lower margin of the lobe, and receives the fourth annectant gyrus. Convolutions op the central lobe (fig. 61, c). The Convoiu- triangular surface of the insula is divided by shallow sulci, con- [sUnd^of verging from the base towards the apex, into five or six small gyri, Reil. which are for the most part concealed by the operculum. Sulci and Convolutions op the Inner Surface op the sulci and Hemisphere (fig. 62). The convolutions of the inner aspect of the l^"^^^-}' heinisphere, with which are included those of the lower surface imun and behind the fissure of Sylvius, are generally well defined ; but some ^^iSes being so long as to reach beyond the extent of a single lobe of the outer surface, they are not usually described as forming lobes like the foregoing.

The inner end is smaller, and is marked in the dry bone, except at the upper part where there is a notch in the osseous margin, by a groove for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum; it is so sloped that the anterior wall and the floor extend inwards beyond the hinder wall and the roof for nearly a quarter of an inch. Condition in In the fcetus the osseous part of the meatus is very imperfect, the the foetus. -fj^Qj. gj^^ anterior wall being composed of fibrous tissue (Symington). After birth the osseous wall is completed by an outgrowth from the ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympam. Fig. 230.* Lining Lining of the meatus. A prolongation of the integument lines Sttfskin. the auditory passage, and is united more closely to the osseous than to the cartilaginous portion ; it is continued over the membrane of the tympanum in the form of a thin pellicle. At the entrance of the meatus are a few hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue over the cartilage Ceruminous of the meatus lie some ceruminous glands of a yellow-brown colour, glands. resembling in form and arrangement the sweat-glands of the skin ; these secrete the ear-wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices ; they are absent in the osseous part, and are most abundant in that small portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue.

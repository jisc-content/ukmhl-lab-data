The thoracic surface is covered by the pleura of each side and the peri- '^Jj^tJ^. cardium (p. 371). At the circumference of the midriff the fleshy attachment l)rocesses of origin alternate with like parts of the transversalis of border, muscle ; but a slight interval separates the slips from the ensiform Jjj^o^^J^j^^ jirocess and seventh cartilage, and a second space exists sometimes between the fibres from the last rib and the arch over the quadratns Fig. 165.* lumborum muscle.

488 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. in which it gastric branches. It then ascends between the layers of the small omentum, on the left side of the bile-duct and poital vein, and divides near the transverse fissure of the liver into two—the right and supplies and left hepatic. Branches are distributed not only to the liver, but also to the stomach, the duodenum, and the pancreas, as btluw :— a. The gastro-duodenal artery is a short vessel which descends beneath the duodenum near the pylorus, and divides into the two following branches :— The right gastro-epijjlo'ic artery (Ji) is the continuation of the gastro-duodenal trunk, and runs from right to left along the great offsets to stomnch, Fig. 149.^ duodenum and pancreas. Branches to the liver, curvatui-e of the stomach. It gives oiisets upwards to the surface of the stomach, and downwards to the great omentum, and ends by inosculating with the left gastro-epiploic artery. The superior pancreatico-duodenal artery (i) is of small size, and descends between the duodenum and pancreas to join the inlerior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. Offsets are given to both the viscera; and on their posterior aspect is another small artery of the pancreatico-duodenal, with a similar position and distribution. h. The pyloric branch (o) descends to the small curvature of the stomach, and, running from right to left, anastomoses Avith the coronary artery; it distributes small twigs on both surfaces of the stomach. The hepatic branches sink into the liver at the transverse fissure, and ramify in its substance :— * Vie-w of the coeliac axis, and of the viscera to which its branches are supplied (Tiedemann). a.

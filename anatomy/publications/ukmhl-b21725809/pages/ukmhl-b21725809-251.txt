235 NUCLEI OP CRANIAL NEEVES. The fourth ventricle communicates above with the third ventricle through the aqueduct of Sylvius, and with the subarachnoid space through an aperture in the j)ia mater between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. Below, it opens into the central canal of the cord. It is lined by ependyma, the ej^ithelium of wliich is continued over the pia mater in the roof, and prolonged upwards and down- wards into the canals leading from the ventricle. Projecting into the lower half of the ventricle is a vascular fold on each sideâ€”choroid plexus, similar to the body of the same name ia the lateral and third ventricles. It is attached to the inner sur- face of the pia mater which closes the ventricle between the medulla and the cerebellum, and extends from the point of the calamus scriptorius to the extremity of the lateral recess of the cavity. It receives branches from the inferior cerebellar artery. The floor of the fourth ventricle is covered by a layer of grey matter, which is continuous below with the grey conunissure of the cord, and above with the grey substance of the aqueduct. Nuclei op cranial nerves (fig. 71). In the dorsal portion of the medulla oblongata and pons are situate the collections of nerve-cells from which many of the cranial nerves take their origin. Some of these a^)- pear in the floor of the fourth ven- tricle, while others are placed a little below the surface. Beneath the calamus scriptorius, and in the portion of the floor of the cavity formed by the medulla oblongata, are the nuclei of the twelfth, tenth, ninth and eighth nerves. The hypoglossal nucleus (XII) extends through nearly the whole length of the medulla ob- longata ; its lower -pavt is hidden, lying in front of the central canal below the level of the fourth ventricle, but its upper half approaches the surface in the lower portion of the fasciculus teres. The nucleus of the vagus (X) corresponds to the ala cinerea, and is continued above into the glosso- pharyngeal nucleus (IX) which lies be- neath the inferior fovea. The position of the inner or principal auditory nucleus (VIIK) is indicated by the auditory tubercle. Openings into other cavities. Choroid plexus of cavity. Grey layer of floor.

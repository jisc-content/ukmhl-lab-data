DISSECTION OF THE KECK. 170 anticus major. Origin. Insertion. Relations. Use. Rectus anticus minor is beneath preceding. the preceding muscle, and is largest at the upper end. Its origin is l>y pointed tendinous slips from the anteiior tuhercles of the ti-an.s- verse processes of the third, fourth, fiftli, and sixth cervical vertebra); and the libres ascend to be inserted, shortly tendinous, into the basilar jn-ocess of the occipital bone by tlie side of the pharyngeal tubercle, reaching from the middle line to the petrous portion of the temjDoral bone. This muscle partly conceals the longus colli and rectus anticus minor. Its anterior sixrface is in contact with the jjliarjaix, the internal and common carotid arteries, and the sympathetic nerve. The origin from the cervical vertebrae corresponds with, that of the scalenus anticus. Action. It Ilexes the head and the cervical portion of the spine. The RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS MINOR (fig. 45, g) is a small flat muscle, which arises from the front of the lateral mass of the atlas at the root of the transverse process, and is inserted into the basilar process of the occijaital bone behind the last nruscle, and half an inch from its fellow. The anterior primary branch of the suboccipital nerve emerges between the borders of this muscle and the rectus capitis lateralis. * Deep muscles of the front of the neck and scaleni. a.

413 GREY SUBSTANCE OF CORD. commissural or connecting piece between them. The same cut demonstrates the existence of a mass of grey matter in the interior, which is arranged in the form of two crescents (one in each half), united by a cross piece, and surromided by white substance. The commissure consists of two parts, viz., a transverse band of'''J}^ com- llllSSUl'G * grey matter (fig. 128, h), with a white stratum in front. The gi'ey transverse band {posterior or grey commissure) connects the pay(.^^°^ opposite crescents, and is j)laced rather nearer the front than the ^-^^-^ back of the cord. In its centre is the shrunken canal of the its central spinal cord (fig. 128, i), which is best seen in the foetus. It reaches the whole length of the medulla, and a cross section of the cord shows it as a round spot. Above, the canal opens on the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and below, it is continued into the filum terminale. It is lined by a columnar ciliated epithelium, and is lined by obstructed by a granular material near the upper end. epithelium, The anterior or ivhite commissure is best marked opposite the en- p^^^^'*^ largements on the cord, and is least developed in the dorsal region.

It is rather nan-ow at its base (cervix ; ^), and enlarged towards its extremity (caput; ^ .^.^ ^ where it is surmounted by a semi-trans- ^ ^ parent layer which has been nam ed the substantia gelatinosa (^). There is also on the inner side of the cervix of the posterior cornu a special portion of grey matter containing nerve-cells, the posterior vesicular column of Clarke {% which is most developed in the lower dorsal region.

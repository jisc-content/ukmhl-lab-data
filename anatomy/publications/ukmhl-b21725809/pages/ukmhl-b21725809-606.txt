592 DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. borum is attaclied ; and its posterior surface is covered by the quad- ratus liimbomm. use. Use. This ligament supports tlie upiight moveable portion of the spinal column, and resists the tendency of the last lumbar vertebra to slip forwards over the inclined base of the sacrum. Symphysis PuBic ARTICULATION (symphysis pubis; fig. 186, a). The two pubis. pui^ic ijoj^eg are united by an interpubic disc, by ligauientous fibres in front and above, and by a strong subpubic ligament. Anterior The anterior jmhic ligament is composed of interlacing fibres Few fibres behind, and above. Subpubic ligament. which are mixed with fibres of the tendon of the external oblique muscle. There is not any definite posterior band ; but the periosteum is thickened by a few scattered fibres. The superior ligamentous fibres fill the interval between the bones above the disc. The subpubic ligament (ligamentum arcuatum; fig. 186, c?) is a strong triangular band occupying the angular interval between the pubic rami at the lower part of the symphysis. Its apex is con- tinuous with the fibrous portion of the interi^ubic disc ; its base is free and concave, and forms the summit of the subpubic arch. * Ligaments of the symphysis pubis, thyi'oid hole, and acetabulum, a.

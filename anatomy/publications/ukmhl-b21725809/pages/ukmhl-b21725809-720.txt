DISSECTION OP THE LEG. 706 Os ealcis with cuboid bone, by dorsal, internal, and inferior ligaments. The last is strongest, and divided into two parts : superficial and The OS calcis with the cuboid bojie. The ligaments in thk articulation are plantar, dorsal, and internal. The dorsal or superior calcaneo-cuboid lirjarnent (fig. 219, ry) is a rather thin fasciculus of fibres, which is attached near to tlie con- tiguous ends of the os calcis and the cuboid bone; it is sometimes divided into two pieces, or it may be situate at the outer border of the foot. At the inner side of the cuboid bone is a stronger internal bmd (fig. 219,/) from the os calcis ; this is fixed behind to the upper Fig. 220.* Fig. 221.+ 3-. part of the os calcis, external to the band to the navicular bone, and in front to the contiguous inner side of the cuboid. The inferior calcaneo-cuboid ligament is much the strongest, and is divided into a superficial and a deep part:â€” The superficial portion, long plantar ligament (fig. 220, '), is attached to the under surface of the os calcis from near the posterior to the anterior tubercle ; its fibres pass forwards to be connected with the ridge on the under surface of the cuboid bone ; but the most internal are continued over the tendon of the peroneus longu.** muscle, assisting to form its sheath, and are inserted into the bases of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. * Plantar ligaments of the foot (Boiirgery). 1. Long plantar ligament. 2. Inner part of the short plantar ligament. 3. Tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. + View of the inferior ligaments of the tarsal bones, a. Long plantar, cut. h.

DISSECTION OF THE BEAIN. 214 (lifTerciit the layers of the septiim lucidum, and has not any lining of vettn-cle. ^^^^^ lateral ventricle (fig, 63) is a narrov/ space which extends nearly the whole length of the hemisphere, and sends a process downwards into the teniporo-sphenoidal lohe. The cavities of the two sides approach one another in front, where they are only separated Fig. 63.* Subdivision, by the tliin septum lucidiim ; and below the liinder part of thdt partition, each communicates with the third ventricle by an ajDerture known as the foramen of Monro. At the back there is a wider interval between them. The roof of the space is formed in its whole extent by the fibres of the corpus callosum passing outwards to the convolutions; in the floor are niimerons objects wliich will be emunerated in connection with the several parts of the A'entricle. The ventricle consists of a central part or body, and three < processes or cornua, anterior, posterior, and middle or inferior. * View of the lateral ventricles : on the left side the descending comu is i laid open.

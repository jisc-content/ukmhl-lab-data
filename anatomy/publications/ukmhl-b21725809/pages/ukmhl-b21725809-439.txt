Afterwards the nerve is to be followed forwards to where it enters beneath the superficial fascia nearer the middle line. The superficial fascia of the anterior half of the perineum is com- Sujierficial posed of two layers, Avhich. differ in their characters and relations. One is the subcutaneous fatty part, continuous with that of the subcutanc- adjoining regions : its thickness, and the quantity of fat in it vary "'^^P^'^*^' Fig. 133.* with the condition of the body. Passijig in front into the scrotum, it there loses its fat, and contains involuntary muscular fibres, forming the layer knoAvn as the dartos. The other (fascia of Colles) is a more membranous stratum of and mem- limited extent, and is connected with the firm subjacent structures. I'a^yer""^ Externally it is fixed to the conjoined rami of the ischium and pubis, outside the line of the crus penis and its'muscle, extending as far back as the ischial tuberosity. Posteriorly this layer bends upwards to join the triangular ligament of the urethra; but in front it is unattached, and is continued to the scrotmn and penis.

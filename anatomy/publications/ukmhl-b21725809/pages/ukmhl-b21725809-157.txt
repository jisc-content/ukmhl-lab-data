SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. 141 the mouth through the largest palatine canal, and courses forwards j^Q^j^y^*^"."'^^^ ! nearly to the incisor teeth, where it joins the naso-palatine nerve. " ' Wliile in the canal, tlie nerve furnishes two or more filaments (inferior nasal,^) to the membrane on the middle and lower sj)ongy bones ; in the roof of the mouth it supplies the mucous membrane I. and glands, and gives an offset to the soft palate. The small ov posterior palatine nerve lies in the smaller canal, small; and and ends inferiorly in the soft palate, the uvula, and the tonsil. It is said to supply the levator palati and azygos uvulte muscles. The external palatine nerve is smaller than the other two, and external descends in the canal of the same name to be distributed to the Palatine. velum palati and the tonsil. The pharyngeal branch is very small, and is directed through the Pharyngeal branch. Fig. 34.* pterygo-palatine canal to supply the mucous membrane of the pharynx near the Eustachian tube.

It will be necessary to cut through the sphenoid bone to follow these nerves to their termination. Connecting branches. The ganglion is united, as before said, with Uniting the spheno-palatine branches of the fifth nerve (fig. 34,'), receiving ^''''"ches, sensory fibres through them ; and through the medium of the *째 Vidian, which is described below, it communicates with a motor nerve (facial), and with the sympathetic nerve. fr^^t^T AK outer wall of the nose and of the palate. 1.

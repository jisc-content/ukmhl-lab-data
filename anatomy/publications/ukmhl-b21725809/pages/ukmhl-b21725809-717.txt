703 MOVEMENTS IN ANKLE-JOINT. Movevients. Only the movements of flexion and extension are per- Kinds of mitted in the ankle; in the former state the toes are raised towards the fore part of the leg; and in the latter, they are pointed towards the ground. Inflexion the astragalus moves backwards so as to project behind; Flexion : and the motion is arrested by the wide part of the astragalus being moving wedged in between the malleoli. bone; The posterior ligament is stretched over the projecting astragalus, state of and the posterior and middle pieces of the external lateral, and the I'ganients. posterior part of the internal lateral ligament, are made tense. In extension the astragalus moves forwards over the end of the Extensiou: tibia, and projects anteriorly. A Limit to the movement is imposed moving by the meeting of the astragalus with the tibia behind. bone; The lateral ligaments are partly made tight as in flexion, for state of instance, the anterior piece of the external, and the fore and middle I's^^'nents; portions of the internal. When the joint is half extended, so that the small hinder part of sliglit lateral the a.stragalus is brought into the arch of the leg-bones, a slight movement of the foot inwards and outwards may sometimes be obtained ; but if the foot is forcibly extended, the ]3ortions of the lateral ligaments attached to the astragalus prevent this lateral movement by their tightness.

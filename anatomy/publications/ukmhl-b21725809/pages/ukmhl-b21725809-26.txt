Directions for removal of brain. Mode of pro- ceeding, and parts cut in succession. the passage of the venous blood. Moreover, the innermost layer sends processes between different parts of the brain, forming the falx, tentorium, &c. The falx cerebri (fig. 3) is the median sickle-shaped process of tlie dura mater, which dips in between the hemispheres of the large brain. Its form and extent will be evident if the light half of the brain is gently separated from it. Nan-ow and pointed in front, where it is attached to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, it widens posteriorly, and joins a horizontal piece of the dura mater named the tentorium cerebelli. Its upper border is convex, and is fixed to the middle line of the skull as far backwards as the internal occipital protuberance ; and the lower or free border, concave, is turned towards the central i^ortion of the brain (coitjus callosum), with which it is in contact posteriorly. In this fold of the dura mater are contained the following sinuses :—the superior longitudinal along the convex border, the inferior longitudinal in the hinder j)art of the lower edge, and the straight sinus at the line of jruiction between it and the tentorium. The SUPERIOR LONGITUDINAL SINUS (fig. 3, 1) extends from the ethmoid bone to the internal occipital protuberance. Its i^osition in the convex border of the falx will be made manifest by the escape of blood through numerous small veins, when pi'essure is made from before back with the finger along the middle line of the diu'a mater. When the sinus is opened it is seen to be narrow in front, and to widen behind, where it ends in a dilatation termed the torcular Herophili on one side (more frequently the right) of the internal occipital protuberance. Its cavity is triangular in form, vnth the apex of the space turned to the falx ; and across it are stretched small tendinous cords—chordte Willisii—near the openings of some of the cerebral veins. Occasionally small Pacchionian bodies pro- ject into the sinus. The sinus receives small veins from the substance of the skull and dura mater, and larger ones from the brain; and the blood flows backwards in it. The cerebral veins open chiefly at the posterior part of the canal, and they lie for some distance against the wall of the sinus before they perforate the dura mater; their course is directed from behind forwards, so that the ciu'rent of the blood in them is evidently opposed to that in the sinus : this dis- position of the veins may be seen on the left side of the brain, where the parts are imdistm-bed. Directions. Before the rest of the dura mater can be examined, the brain must be taken from the head. To facilitate its removal, let the head incline backwards, while the shoulders are raised on a block, so that the brain may be separated somewhat from the base of the skull. For the division of the cranial nerves a sharp scalpel will be necessary ; and the nerves are to be cut longer on the one side than the other. Bemoval of the Brain. As a first step cut across the anterior part of the falx cerebri, and the difl'erent cerebral veins entering the

In their conrse downwards the nerves snpply cliietly tegumentary branches : ijjterai one of these is directed backwards by the side of the metacarpal phixlanx, and after nniting with the digital nerve on the back of the finger (p. 285), is contumed to the dorsum of the last x^halanx.

To expose them, the ulnar artery tendons?''"'^ should be cut through below the origin of the deep branch ; and the superficial volar branch of the radial having been divided, the palmar arch is to be thrown towards the fingers. The ulnar and median nerves are also to be cut below the annular ligament, and turned downwards. _ * Superficial dissection of the palm of the hand. (Illustrations of Dissec- tions.) Muscles: a. Abductor pollicis. c. Outer head of flexor brevis. D. Adductor pollicis. n. Palmaris brevis. Arteries: a. Ulnar, b. Radial, c. Superficial volar branch, d. Superficial palmar arch. c.

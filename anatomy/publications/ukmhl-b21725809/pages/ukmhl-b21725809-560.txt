After surround- ing the upper portion of the rectum, and forming a fold (ineso- rectum) hehind it, the membrane covers the upper surface of the bladder, and projects for some \V-ay between the two vLscera, thus giving rise to the recto-vesical pouch (fig, 145, rvp): on eacli Fig. 170.* The pori- toucuin COV(M-S piu'dy till' rectum â– ; and partlj" the bladder, leaving fi'ont and lower part free.

All the front and lower part of the bladder are therefore uncovered by peritoneum ; and when the bladder is distended it rises above the pubic bones, so as to allow of its being opened in front without injury to the serous membrane. The recto-vesical pouch is wide above, where it corresponds with the interval between the iliac arteries, and is narrow below between the rectum and bladder. It descends slightly into the interval between the vesiculte seminales, and ends usually at a line joining the spots where the ureters enter the wall of the bladder.

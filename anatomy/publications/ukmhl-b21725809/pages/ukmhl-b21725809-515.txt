501 LARGE INTESTINE. 111 length this ijortion of the alimentary canal measures about length; live or six feet,—one-fifth of the length of the intestinal tube. The diameter of the colon is largest at the commencement of the cascmn, size, and gradually decreases as far as the upper part of the rectum : in the lower part of the rectum there is a dilatation above the amis. When compared with the small intestine, the colon is distinguished Compared by the following characters :—It is generally of greater capacity, .^^[['''la^r^p being in some places as large again, and is more fixed in its position ; it is also free from convolution, except in the left iliac fossa, where more fixed, it forms the sigmoid flexure. Instead of being a smooth cylindrical tube, the colon is sacculated, and is marked l)y three longitudinal not coiled, muscular bands, which alternate with as many rows of dilatations ; but in the Fig. 156.* sacculated witli bands. rectum the surface is smooth, and the Append- ages.

Attached to the surface, especially along the transverse colon, are small processes of peritoneum containing fat—the appen- dices epiploicac. Dissection. For the purpose of examin- ing the large intestine, the student should cut oS and blow up the caecum, with part of the ileum entering it ; and he should prepare in a similar way a piece of the transverse colon, and a piece of the sigmoid flexure (about four inches of each). The areolar tissue and the fat are to be removed with care from each, after it has been inflated. The CjECUM, or the head of the colon (fig. 156, a), is the rounded end of the large intestine which projects, in the form of a pouch, below the junction of the ileum with it. It measures about two inches and a half in length, and rather more in width, though gra- dually narrowing below: it is the widest its inner side it is joined by the small lower there is a small worm-like projection (c)—the vermiform appendix.

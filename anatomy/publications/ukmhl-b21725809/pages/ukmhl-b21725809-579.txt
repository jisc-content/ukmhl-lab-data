Numerous ganglia are found in iiowfonnecl ; tlie plexus, especially at the points of union of the spinal and sympathetic nerves. Olfsets. From each plexus offsets are furnished along the branches offsets to of the internal iliac artery to the viscera of the pelvis, and the genital of tlie male, organs: these form secondary plexuses, and have the same name as ^iz-i the vessels on which they are placed. The inferior hcemorrhoiclal plexus is an offset from the back of to the the plexus to the rectum, and joins the sympathetic on the superior hsemorrhoidal artery (p. 483). The vesical plexus contains large offsets, with many white-fibred ^"^^^^Jj^gj, or spinal nerves, and passes forwards to the side and neck of the bladder. It gives one plexus to the vesicula seminalis, and another to the vas deferens. The prostatic plexus leaves the front of the pelvic plexns, and to the pro- supplies the substance of the prostate. At the front of the prostate penis'; an offset (cavernous) is continued onwards to the dorsum of the penis, to sujjply the cavernous structure. On the penis the cavernous nerves join the pudic nerve. In the female there are the following additional plexuses for the offsets in supply of the viscera peculiar to that sex :— ' Ovarian plexus. The chief nerves to the ovary are derived from to the the renal and aortic plexuses (p. 483), and accompany the artery of "^^'^ ' that body ; but the uterine nerves supply some filaments to it. Vaginal nerves. The nerves of the vagina are large, and are not to the plexiform, but consist in greater part of s^Dinal nerve-fibres ; they ^''"'^'"^' end in the lower part of the tube. The uterine nerves are furnished to the uterus with only a small and to the adinixtiu'e of the sj)inal nerves : they ascend along the side of the uterus, and consist of long slender filaments without ganglia or communications. The Fallopian tube receives its branches from the iiterine nerves. Some few nerves surrounding the arteries of the uterus are plexi- form and ganglionic. The LYMPHATIC GLANDS OF THE PELVIS form oue chain in front Cliain of pe!- of the sacrum, and another along the internal iliac vessels : their siancls; efferent ducts join the lumbar glands. Into these glands the deep l}Tnphatics of the penis, those of the genital organs in the female, entering and the lymphatics of the viscera and wall of the pelvis are col- them. ° lected. Section V.

FIBRES OF MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 195 Pyramid and anterior column. The fibres of the pyramid form a Fibres of the well-defined and independent bundle (fig. 58, «) through the whole l'y'a""d, e.\.tent of the medulla oblongata, and are continued below partly into the anterior column of the same side, and partly into the lateral column of the opjiosite half of the cord. The set of fibres keeping to the same side forms the outer portion of the pyramid, but in the anterior column of the cord, where it is known as the direct pyramidal direct, tracty it is placed close to the anterior median fissure. The decus- sating fibres are usually the more numerous, and pass obliquely and crossed, backwards, across the median fissure and behind the opposite anterior column, to enter the lateral column, where they constitute the crossed pyramidal tract. Upwards, the fibres of the pyramid are prolonged through the pons to the crusta of the cerebral peduncle (fig. 56, c, d). The fibres of the anterior column of the cord which Rest of are not continued into the pyramid incline backwards, and enter the coiumu reticular formation of the medulla oblongata. ^° The decussation of the pyramids (fig. 56, b) occupies the anterior Decussation fissure of the medulla oblongata at a distance of three-quarters of an I'y'''^''^'^^- inch from the pons. It is about a quarter of an inch in length, and is generally constracted by the crossing of three or four bimdles of * I>?ep dissection of the medulla oblongata, pons, and crus cerebri, a. i-yramidal fibres, cut through, and raised as far as the optic thalamus b iatera tract, c. Olivary body. d. Deep longitudinal fibres in the pons, aenved from the anterior and lateral columns of the cord. c.

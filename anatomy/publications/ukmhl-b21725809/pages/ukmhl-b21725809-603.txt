The sacrum is joined at its base to the last lumbar vertebra, at its apex to the coccyx, and laterally to the two hip- bones. And the hip-bones are connected together in front, as well as to the spinal column behind. Union of Pieces of Sacrum and Coccyx. So long as the pieces Ligaments of the sacrum aud coccyx remain moveable they are articulated as tlpaT&t^', in the other vertebrae by an anterior and posterior common ligament, with an intervertebral disc for the bodies ; and by other ligaments for the neural arch and processes (p. 374). After the sacral vertebrae have coalesced, only rudiments of the and joined, ligaments of the bodies are to be recognised ; and when the jiieces of the coccyx unite by bone, their ligaments disappear. Sacro-Vertebral Articulation. The base of the sacrum is Sacrum articulated with the last lumbar vertebra by ligaments similar to lumbir^* those uniting one vertebra to another (p. 374) ; and by one special vertebra, ligament—the sacro-vertebral. Dissection. For the best manner of bringing these different liga- Dissection, ments into view, the dissector may consult the directions given for the dissection of the ligaments of the vertebrae (p. 374). The common ligaments for the bodies of the two bones are an By liga- anterior and a posterior, with an intervening fibro-cartilaginous substance. Between the neural arches lie the ligamenta subflava ; tebne, and between the spines the supra- and interspinous bands are situate. The articular processes are united by capsular ligaments with s}tio- vial membranes. The sacro-vertebral ligament is a variable bundle of fibres, which and by a reaches from the under surface of the tip of the transverse process ban? sacro- of the last lumbar vertebra to the lateral mass at the base of the vertebral, sacrum.

Dissection. Little dissection is needed for these ligaments. When Dissection.

ISCHIO-RECTAL FOSSA. 419 wlucli are contained in a sheath of fascia; opposite the ischial tulierosity they are situate about an inch and a half from the edge of the bone, but towards the front of the space they approach to within half an inch of the margin of the ischial ramus. Crossing ihe centre of the hollow are the inferior ■hsoniorrhoidal vessels and nerve (b),—branches of the pudic. At the anterior part, for a short P^j^^^J^'^^ distance, are two superficial perineal nerves (-) (of the pudic) ; and at the posterior part is a small branch of the fourth sacral nerve (^), with cutaneous oftsets of the sacral plexus ("*) and inferior hreraor- rhoidal vessels (c), bending round the gluteus. Into this space the surgeon sinks his knife in the first incision First cut ii in the lateral operation of lithotomy ; and as he carries it from entersTthls before backwards, he wOl divide the superficial hoemorrhoidal vessels space, and nerve. Muscles. Connected with the lower end of the rectum are four Muscles of muscles, viz., a fine cutaneous muscle, and two sphincters (external and internal), with the levator ani.

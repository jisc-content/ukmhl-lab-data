DISSECTION OF THE CEBIT. 48 Lower oblique muscle. inferior oblique muscle, let the eyeball be replaced in its natural position ; tlien by separating the lower eyelid from the margin of the orbit, and removing some fat, the muscle will appear beneath the eyeball, arching from the inner to the outer side : il the external tarsal ligament be divided it may be followed upwards to its insertion into the ball. The INB-EEIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE (fig. 12, h) is placed near the anterior margin of the orbit, and differs from the other muscles in being directed across, instead of parallel to the axis of the orbit. Fig. 12.* Origin. It arises from the superior maxillary bone immediately outside the Course. opening of the nasal duct. From this spot the muscle passes out- wards between the inferior rectus and the bone, then between the Insertion, eyeball and the external rectus, to be inserted into the sclerotic coat between the outer and upper recti. Relations. The borders of the muscle look forwards and backwai'ds, and the posterior receives its branch of the third nerve. The insertion of the tendon is near that of the superior oblicLue muscle, but rather closer to the optic nerve. * Third view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:—a.

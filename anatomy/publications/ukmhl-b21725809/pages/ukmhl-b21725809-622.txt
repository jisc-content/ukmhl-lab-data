DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 608 the inner is tlio crural canal; The crural canal (fig. 189) is the innermost space in the interior of the crural slieath :â€”Its length is about a third of an incli, and It reaches from the base of Gimbernat's ligament to the upper coniu of the saphenous opening. It decreases rapidly in size from above down, and is closed below. The aperture by which the space com- municates with the cavity of the abdomen is named the crural ring. Fig. 189. liarts around it. Cnu'al rins situation and fomi; boundaries. In front of the canal are Poupart's ligament and the upper end of the falcifoiTU margin of the sajjhenous opening; while behind it is the pectineus inuscle. On the outer side of the canal, but in the sheath, is the femoral vein. Through this channel the intestine jjasses from the abdomen in femoral hernia. The crural ring is the upper opening of the crural canal. It is on a level with the base of Gimbernat's ligament (fig. 143, d), and is larger in the female than in the male. Oval in shajDe, its greatest measurement is from side to side, in which direction it equals about half an inch ; and it is filled by a lymphatic gland. The structures around the ring, outside the crural sheath, are similar to those bounding the canal, viz., in front, the suiDcrficial and the deep crnral arch, and behind, the pubis covered by the * Dissection of the crural sbeath (Illustrations of Dissections), a.

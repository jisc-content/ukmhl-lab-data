The internal Parts^^^ oblique conceals the transversalis muscle, and the vessels and nerves internal l)et\veeu tlie two. Near Poupart's ligament it lies on the spermatic o^liqup. cord and the transverealis fascia. The rectus muscle is covered below by the aponeurosis. The TRxVNSVERSALIS MUSCLE (fig. 140, a) fomiS the third stratum Transversa- lis niusciG ' in the wall of the abdomen, and differs from the two oblique mus- cles in ha-vdng a posterior as well as an anterior aponeurosis. Like the internal oblique it is attached on all sides, except where the siiermatic cord lies. At the pelvis it arises from the outer third of origin from I ^ , chest, loins Poupart's ligament, and the anterior two-thirds or the iliac crest and pelvis along the inner border ; at the chest it takes origin hj fleshy slips from the inner surface of the lower six costal cartilages ; and be- tween the chest and the pelvis it is connected with the lumbar flares end vertebrfe by means of the posterior aponeurosis or the fascia lum-aponen- Â»' J.

Internally it is continued to the linea alba, pass- ijehind ing beneath the rectus as low as midway between the umbilicus and rectus, ex- C6T)t 111 the pubis, but in front of the muscle below that spot. Its attacb- lower part. ment below to the pelvis is nearly the same as the internal oblique ; for it is fixed to the front of the pubis, and to the pectineal line for about an inch, but iDeneath the oblique muscle. Some of the fibres pi^res to end on the transversalis fascia, and are connected beneath Poupart's transversalis ligament with a thickened band of that fascia which is called the deej) crural arch. Action. The transversalis muscle draws downwards the lower ribs, Use. and diminishes the abdominal cavity, compressing the viscera and forcing upwards the diaphragm. Conjoined tendon. The aponeuroses of the internal oblique and At pelvis transversalis muscles are united more or less near their attachment conjoined to the pubis, and give rise to the conjoined tendon. The aponeu- tendon, rosis of the oblique muscle extends about half an inch along the pectineal line ; while that of the transversalis reaches an inch along the bony ridge, and forms the greater part of the conjoined tend(m.

Superficial to the transversalis are the two muscles Relations or before examined; and beneath it is the thin transversalis fascia, niuspir'^"^''' Its fleshy attachments to the ribs alternate with like processes of the diaphragm ; and the highest slip joins the lower edge of the triangularis .sterni muscle. The lower border of the transversalis is fleshy in the outer, but tendinous in the inner half, and is arched above the internal abdominal ring. Dissection. To remove the aponeurotic layer from the rectus Expose muscle of the right side, make a longitudinal incision through the [fy/amidSis tendinous sheath, and turn it to eacli side. As the fascia is retlected,

182 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. from tlie nervous substance, the intervab between the vessels being closed by connective tissue so as to form a continuous membrane. From its deep aspect minute and very numerous vessels pass into the brain perpendicularly to the surface. Vessels and Vessels and nerves. The arachnoid has no vessels, but various luemlbraues. anatomists have described minute branches of some of the cranial nerves in the membrane. The sources of the vessels of the pia mater are given below, and its nerves, which are probably destined for the vessels, come from several cranial nerves and the sympathetic. Dissection of Dissection. To follow out the arteries, let the brain remain upside arteries down, and let the arachnoid membrane be removed from them. Having displayed the trunks of the vertebral arteries on the medulla oblongata, and those of the carotid near the median fissure of the of large large brain, the student should lay bare on one side the branches ' to the large brain. Define first the two arteries (anterior cerebral) lying in the median fissure and joining by a short branch ; next, an artery that passes outwards in the fissrae of Sylvius (middle cere- bral), and pursue it to the outer surface of the hemisjjhere. Look then for a much smaller vessel (choroid), which sinks into the brain on the outer side of the crus cerebri. By gently raising the cere- bellum on the same side, the last ailery of the cerebrum (posterior cerebral) may be traced back to the inner "pavt of the hemisiDhere. and of small Two principal arteries pass to the small brain. One on the brain. upper surface (superior cerebellar) may be brought into view vnth the slender foui-th nerve by its side on raising the cerebellum. The other artery (inferior cerebellar) turns backwards from the vertebral to the median groove, and may be easUy followed. Arteries of Artbeies OF THE Bbain (fig. 52). The brain is supj)lied with the braiu. blood by the vertebral and internal carotid arteries.

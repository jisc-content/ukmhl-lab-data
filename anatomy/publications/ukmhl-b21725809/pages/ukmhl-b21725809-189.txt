173 liga:\[ents of atlas and axis. arches of the upper two vertebrce, to Avhich special ligaments are attadied. i c, • , Special ligaments unite tlie first two cer^acal vertebrae to each fv^;^^^^ other and to the occipital bone : some of these are external to, and othei-s within the spinal canal. The ligaments oiUside the spinal canal are fibrous membranes, Jetween Avhich connect the axis to the atlas, and the latter to the occipital vertebra ^_ bone in front and behind. Capsular ligaments also surround the ^^'/i^X'.^"" articulations formed by these bones on each side, but they mil be examined more conveniently after the spinal canal has been opened. ^^^^^^.^^ The anterior atlanto-axial ligament (fig. 46, 3) consists of a mem- liga^lent branous layer attached to the anterior arch of the atlas and the body bet^veen of the axis, and a superficial thickened band in the centre, prolonged atlas ami from the upper end of the anterior common ligament, and connect- ins the ridge on the front of the axis to the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas. The anterior occivito-atlantal ligament (fig. 46) resembles the and between foregoing, and passes from the basilar process of the occipital l^one, occipital immediately in front of the foramen magnum, to the anterior arch 1^°"^. of the atlas. Its central part is also thickened, and is fixed to the . tubercle on the front of the atlas. The posterior occipito-atlantal ligament (fig. 47, ^) is a thin broad Posterior membrane, the deep surface of which is intimately united to the bftwecu dura mater. It is attached above to the hinder margin of the ^'^^^'^'ifj^^^ foramen magnimi of the occipital bone, and below to the jDosterior atlas,' ■arch of the atlas. Behind the upper articular process of the atlas it forma an arch over the groove of the bone in this situation, * External ligaments in front between the occipital bone, atlas, and axis.

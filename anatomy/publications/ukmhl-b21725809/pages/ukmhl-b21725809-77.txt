61 ANTERIOR TRIANGULAR SPACE. Muscles in the space. In the area of the triangular interval, as it Contents of is above defined, are seen the larynx and pharynx in part, and '° many muscles converging towards the hyoid bone, some being above and some below it. BeloAV are the depressors of that bone, viz., -hyoid, stemo-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid, to "); and above are omo the elevator muscles, viz., mylo-hyoid, digastric, and stylo-hyoid. Fig. 15. Connected with the back of the hyoid bone and the larynx are some of the constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Vessels in the triangular space. The carotid blood vessels (" and ") a^terylii occupy the hinder and deeper part of the space along the side of space, the sterno-mastoid muscle ; and their course would be marked on Course- the surface by a line from the stemo-clavicular articulation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. As high as the level of the cricoid cartilage they are buried beneath Covering.s- * Anterior triangular space of the neck (Quain's "Arteries"). 1. Stemo- raastoid. 2. Sterno-hyoid. 3. Anterior belly of orao-hyoid. 4. , Thyro- hyoid. 6. Common carotid artery dividing. 7. Internal jugular vein. 8. External jugular vein.—In the original drawing the sterno-mastoid is partly cut through.

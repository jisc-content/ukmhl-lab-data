Occipito- frontalis, how seen: take care not to cut away apo- neurosis. anterior portion qf wliicli is the attraliens, -vvliile the posterior Is the attollens aurem muscle. On drawing forwards the ear, a ridge marks the situation of the posterior muscle. To remove the integuments, let the scalpel be carried downwards about an inch behind the ear, from the trans- verse cut above as far as to a level with the lobule of the ear, and then forwards below the lobule. After the piece of skin included by those cuts has been reflected towards the ear, the retrahent muscle must be sought beneath the subcutaneous tissue ; it consists of rounded bundles of fibres, and is stronger and deeper than the others. The ATTRAHENS AUREM (fig. 1, is a Small fan-shaped muscle, and arises from the fore part of the aponeurosis of the occipito- frontal: s. Its fibres are directed downwards and backwards, and are inserted into a projection on the front of the rim of the ear. Beneath it are the superficial temporal vessels and nerve. The ATTOLLENS AUREM (fig. 1, has the same form as the preceding, though its fibres are longer and better marked. Arising also from the tendon of the occipito-frontalis, the fibres converge to their insertion into the inner or cranial surface of the pinna of the ear,â€”into an eminence corresponding with a fossa (that of the antihelix) on the o]3posite aspect. The RETRAHENS AUREM (fig. 1, consists of two or three roundish but separate bundles of fibres, which are stronger than those of the other muscles. The bmidles arise from the root of the mastoid process, and pass almost horizontally forwards to be inserted by tendinous fibres into the lower part of the ear (concha) at its cranial aspect. The auricular branches of the posterior auricular artery and nerve are in contact with this muscle. Action. The three preceding muscles will move the outer ear slightly in the directions indicated by their names : the anterior dramng it upwards and forwards, the middle one U2Dwards, and the posterior backwards. The OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS MUSCLE (fig. 1, ^,''), covers the greater part of the vault of the skull, and consists of anterior and posterior fleshy parts with an intervening aponeurotic tendon. Dissection. To expose the occipito-frontalis, the transverse incision already made on the side of the head is to be prolonged above the eyebrow to the root of the nose, and from the latter spot a cut is to be carried backwards along the middle line of the head to the ex- ternal occipital protuberance. The flap of skin, thus marked out, is to be raised from before back with the subjacent fat; Avhile doing this the dissector will meet first with the anterior fleshy -part of the muscle, next with a white shining thiii aponeurosis, and lastly with the posterior fleshy belly towards the lateral aspect of the cranium. The aponeurosis of the muscle is easily taken away with the granular fat superficial to it; and if the under surface of the flap presents a white instead of a yellow ajipearance, the student may suspect he is removing that membrane. The imterior or occipital part (*) arises from the outer half or two-

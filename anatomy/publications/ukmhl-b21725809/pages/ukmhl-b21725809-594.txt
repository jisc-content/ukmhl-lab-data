DISSECTION OP THE PELVIS. 680 dissection to see it; anterior commissure must be removed ; and, after tlie body of the organ has been hiid bare, the crura, one on each side, are to be followed outwards. The CLITORIS (fig. 181, &) is a small erectile body, and is the repre- sentative of the penis. It has the same composition as the penis, except that the urethra is not continued along it. Its anteiior extremity is terminated by a rounded part or glans (c), and is has a giaus covered by a fold of the mucous membrane con-esponding to the vnL^T' prepuce of the male (p. 432). composi- its structure this organ resembles the penis in the following particulars :â€”It consists of corpora cavernosa, which are attached is like the penis; Fig 181.' corpora cavernosa, corpus spongio- sum, and erectile tissue. Bulbs of vestibule: by crura (one on each side ; a) to the ischio-pubic ranai, and are blended in the body. A small suspensory ligament descends to it from the superficial fascia of the mons Veneris; and along the middle is an imperfect jjectiniform septum. Farther, it possesses a portion of corpus spongiosum, but this structure is limited to the glans clitoridis (c). Structure. The outer fibrous casing and the septum are alike in both penis and clitoris ; and in the interior of the clitoris is an erectile tissue, like that in the male organ (p. 576). The blood-vessels of the corpus cavernosum are like those of the penis; and the glans receives the ending of the doreal artery (p. 440). The BULB OF THE VESTIBULE (semi-bulb, Taylor; fig. 182, a) is an elongated and flattened mass of cavernoiis or erectile tissue, which is enclosed in a thin fibrous coat. It lies by the side of the vestibule * Representation of the clitoris, a. Crus, and b. Body of the corpus cavernosum c. Qhins clitoridis.

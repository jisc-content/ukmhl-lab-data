DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 584 internal, and middle. Mucous membraue. The internal fibres describe circles round the openings of the Fallopian tiibes, and spread from those apertures till they meet at the middle line. At the neck of the uterus they are amnged in a transverse direction. The middle or intervening set of fibres are more indistinct tlian the others, and have a less determinate direction. The mucous lining of the uterus is continued into the vagina at one end, and into the Fallopian tubes at the other. In the body it is thin and soft, of a reddish-white coloui-, smooth, and closely Fig. 183. Vessels are large. Arteries. Veins. Nerves. Lympha- tics : two sets. Round liga- ment ends in groin; attachment to uterus; adherent. In the cervix it is stronger, and presents the folds before referred to. The blood-vessels of the uterus are large and tortuous, and occupy canals in the uterine substance, in which they commimicate freely together. The arteries are furnished from the uterine and ovarian branches (p. 560). The veins correspond with the arteries ; they are of large size, and form plexuses in the utenis (p. 560). The nerves are derived from the symjjathetic (p. 565), and are very small in proportion to the size of the uterus. Lymphatics. One set accompanies the uterine vessels to the glands on the iliac artery. Another set issues from the fundus, enters the broad ligament, and accompanies the ovarian artery to the glands on the aorta : the last are joined by lymphatics of the ovary and Fallopian tube. Round ligament of the uterus (fig. 171, n). This firm cord sup- ports the uterus, and is contained partly in the broad ligament, and partly in the inguinal canal. It is about five inches in length, and is attached to the uj)per end of the uterus close below and in front of the Fallopian tube.

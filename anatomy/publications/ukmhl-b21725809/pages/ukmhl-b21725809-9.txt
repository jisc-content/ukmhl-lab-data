PEEFACE. In this edition of the Demonstrations of Anatomy, the plan and arrangement of the work, as explained in former editions, have not been altered; but the deso'iption of the minute structure of the viscera and sense-organs has been omitted, in view of the increased facilities which exist at the present day for the study of microscopic Anatomy. The figures illustrating the text have been added to by the introduction of thirteen new woodcuts. In carrying out the revision of the text, I have endeavoured to maintain the efficiency of the work as a guide to the acquisition of knowledge by practical study. September, 1887. G. D. THANE.

A part of the third nerve, however, and the branch of the fourth entering the plexus unite to form a lower smaller trunkâ€”the pudic nerve ; and other branches are given off by the several nerves before their union. Fig. 174.* Branches. Most of the offsets of the plexus are distributed outside the pelvis, and are met with, in the dissection of the buttock (p. 639); of these only the origin is to be seen now. The named branches are the great and small sciatic, the superior and inferior gluteal, the pudic, and the perforating cutaneous. Other small offsets are furnished to some of the muscles of the buttock. a. The great sciatic nerve (fig. 174, gs) is the principal nerve of deat sciatic. * Diagram of the sacral plexus, from behind.

213 CORPUS CALLOSUM. Its centviil part, which is exposed in the longitudinal fissure, is very situation, narrow, and measures about tliree inches in length. It is nearer to extent and the anterior than to the posterior end of the cerebrum, and is some- what arclicd from before backwards. On each side its upper surface is free for a short distance beneath the callosal convolution, from which it is separated by a groove. In front, the corpus callosum is bent downwards (fig. G2), forming Anterior thL- (jeniL and rostrum as before described (p. 203) ; and behind, it posterior ends in a thickened part named the spleniitvi. ends. The fibres of the corpus callosum are for the most part directed Fibres transvei-sely, but on the upper surface there is a somewhat irregular, transverse ; narrow longitudinal band on each side close to the middle line (strice tndinaL"^' longitudinales or nerves of Lancisi). Between the two bands is a median groove or raph^. Farther out there may be seen other loncfitudinal fibres belonging to the covered band, if that has not been completely removed. The longitudinal striae are prolonged downwards in front, and form the peduncles of the corj)us callosum (p. 203). Dissection. In order to see the thickness of the corpus callosum, Dissection, and to bring into view the parts in relation with its under surface, a cut is to be made through it on the right side about half an inch from the raphe ; and this is to be extended forwards and backwards, as far as the limits of the underlying ventricle. While cutting through the corpus callosum, the student may observe that a thin membraniform structure (ependyma) lines its under surface. The corpus callosum is thicker at each end than at the centre, in is thickened consequence of a greater number of fibres being collected from the ^* cerebrum ; and the posterior iDart is the thickest of all. Connected Under with its xmder surface along the middle is the septum lucidum or partition between the ventricles (fig. 63, b) at the fore part, and the fornix (c) beliind. This is the chief commissural body of the halves of the cerebrum, and its fibres pass laterally into the medullary centre of the hemi- sphere, in which they radiate to the convolutions. Dissection. The left lateral ventricle is to be now opened in the Dissection, same way as the right; and to prepare for the examination of the cavity on the right side, as much of the corpus callosum as forms the roof of the space is to be removed. A part of the ventricle extends down in the temporo-sphenoidal lol)e towards the base of the brain; and to open it, a cut is to be carried outwards and down- wards, through the substance of the hemisphere, along the course of the hollow. (See fig. 63.) Ventiucles of the brain. Five ventricles are described in the Brain con- brain ; but four of them are subdivisions of one large central cavity, ventricles, and these are lined thrcnighout by a thin membrane named the ependyrna, which is covered by epithelium, for the most part ciliated. They are the two lateral ventricles, one in each cerebral hemisphere, the third ventricle close to the base of the brain, and the fourth ventricle, between the cereljellum and the back uf the pons and medulla oblongata. The fifth ventricle is a small space l^etween Fifth is

Next, the ring of the occipital bone bounding posteriorly the foramen magnum is to be taken away. Lastly, the student should detach the tube of dura mater from the interior of the spinal canal; and, by foUowhig upwards the posterior common ligament of the l)odies of the vertebra), its continuation, the long occipito-axial ligament, -will be exposed. The lone/ or postei'ior occipito-axial ligament Q) is a strong flat band Long ■which continues ujDwards the posterior common ligament of the vertebrte. Its upper end is broad, and is attached to the upper ligament, surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, reaching outwards Fig. 49.* on each side as far as the insertion of the check ligaments. De- scending thence through the foramen magnum, and over the odon- toid process, it becomes somewhat narrower, and is inserted mainly into the back of the body of the axis, but many of the superficial fibres are prolonged into the posterior common ligament. Occasion- ally a biu^a is found between it and the transverse ligament. _ Dissection (fig. 49). After the removal of the long occipito-axial Dissection ligament, by cuttmg through it transversely above, and reflecting it downwards, the student should define a strong band, the trans- verse ligament, which crosses the neck of the odontoid process, and sends upwards and downwards a slip to the occipital bone, and the axis. The upper offset from the transverse ligament may be cut through afterwards for the purpose of seeing the odontoid ligaments, andortontnid which radiate from the process, the central one being a slender band i'S"»ieiits. in the middle line, and the lateral, much stronger, passing nearly horizontally outwards. * Internal ligaments between the occipital bone, atlas, and axis, second view, ^courgery ) 1.

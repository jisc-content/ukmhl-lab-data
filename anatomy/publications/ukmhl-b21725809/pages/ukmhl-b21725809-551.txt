Arising in front of the anterior m the crural from the second, third, and fourth nerves in the plexus "'"^oi'^e"; (sometimes not from the second), it niakes its appearance at the inner border of the psoas near the sacro-iliac articulation. Escaped from beneath the nmscle, the nerve crosses the side of the pelvis ])elow the external iliac, but above the obturator vessels, and enters ends in the the thigh through the aperture at the top of tlie thyxoid foramen. ' Occasionally the obturator gives origin to the following branch : — The accessory obturator nerve (l) arises from the trunk of the occasionally obturator, or from the third and fourth nerves of the plexus. Its "j"ancir^°-'^ coui-se is along the inner border of the psoas, beneath the investing fascia, and over the hip-bone to the thigh, where it ends by joining the obturator nerve, and suj)plying the hijvjoint (p. 625). G VXC.LIATED CORD OF THE SYMPATHETIC. The lumbar part of Symrathetic T jy Z c J.^ coTd in the the gangliated cord of the sympathetic is placed on the iront ot tiie abdomen spinal column (fig. 167, o) : it lies along the inner border of ])soas muscle, and is somewhat concealed on the right side by the vena cava, on the left by the aorta. The cord possesses four or five has fo^^r^or ^ oval ganglia opposite the bodies of the vertebrae, which supply " " ' connectinsj and visceral branches. Connectinci branches. From each ganglion two small branches are l'™nche.s to directed backwards along the centre of the body of the vertebra, nerves, with the lumbar artery ; these unite with one or two spinal nerves near the intervertebral foramen. The connecting branches are long in the lumbar region, in consequence of the gangliated cord being carried forwards by the psoas muscle from the intervertebral foramina. Branches of distribution. Most of the internal branches throw '^^^ t° ^'"^ themselves into the aortic and h}qDogastric plexuses, and so reach the viscera indirectly. Some filaments enter the vertebrae and their connecting ligaments. Last dorsal nerve (fig. 167, e). The anterior primary branch i^ast dorsal of the last dorsal resembles the intercostal nerves in its distribution, but differs from them in not being contained in an intercostal space. Lying below the last rib, the nerve is directed outwards across the course to upper part of the quadratus lumboruni, but beneath the external aMomen'-'^ arched ligament and the fascia of the quadratus. At the outer border of that muscle it perforates the middle layer of the fascia lumljorum, and enters the wall of the abdomen, where it ends in an abdominal and a lateral cutaneous branch (p. 450). The first lumbar artery accompanies it. , Near the spine it furnishes a small branch to the quadratus muscle: ^'"anch to iiiiisclc and it may communicate by means of this with the first lumbar nerve. The LUMBAR ARTERIES of the aoi'ta (]). 527) are furnished to the LiiiiiV'' back, the spinal canal, and the wall of the abdomen : they resemble Ave'in num. the aortic intercostals in their course and distribution.

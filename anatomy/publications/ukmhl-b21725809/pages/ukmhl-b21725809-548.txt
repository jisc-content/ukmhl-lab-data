Beginning of the tho- racic duct. To 8liow the origin of the duct, the diaphragm is to be divided over the aorta, and its piUars are to he thrown to the sides : a piece may be cut out of the aorta opposite the first lumbar vertebra. The beginning of the duct (receptaculum chyli), and the lower end of the large azygos vein may be well seen : and the two are to be followed upwards into tlie thorax. On the left side the student may trace the splanchnic nerves and the small azygos vein through the pillar of the diaphragm, and may show the knotted cord of the sympathetic nerve entering the abdomen beneath the arch over the j^soas muscle. Lymphatic glands. A chain of glands is placed along the side of the external iliac artery, and along the front and sides of the lumbar vertebrfE ; they are connected by short tubes, which increase in size and diminish in number, and opposite the first lumbar vertebra form one principal trunk which enters the thoracic duct. Into the glands the lymj)hatics of the lower limbs, and those of some of the viscera and of the wall of the abdomen are received. Another cluster of large glands surrounds the cceliac axis, and covers the upper end of the abdominal aorta. They are distinguished as the cceliac glands, and receive the lymphatics of the stomach, spleen, pancreas and great part of the liver. Their ducts unite with those of the mesentei'ic glands, and give rise to one or more large trunks, which pass to the common thoracic duct. Receptaculum chyli. The thoracic duct begins in the abdomen by the union of three or four large lymphatic trunks. Its commence- ment is marked by a dilatation, which is placed on the right side of the aorta, opposite the first or second lumbar vertebra. The duct enters the thorax by jiassing through the diaphragm with the aorta. Section VI. SPINAL AND SYMPATHETIC NERVES. The spinal nerves of the loins enter into a plexus, and supjily the limb and the contiguous portions of the trunk. Dissection (fig. 167).

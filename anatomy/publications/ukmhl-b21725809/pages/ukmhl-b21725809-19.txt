B 2 OCCIPITO-FRONTALIS MUSCLE. 8 thirds of the upper curved line of the occipital hone, and from the OccMpitai. mastoid portion of the temporal hone. The fibres are about one inch i;^^^ ^,,^,,17, and a half in length, and ascend to the aponeurosis. The anterior or fi-ontal part {') forms a thin layer whicli covers Frontal about the lower two-thirds of the frontal bone. Its fibres are paler than those of the occipital part, and spring from the aponeurosis tache.l. Fie 1.* some distance below the line of the coronal suture. They descend to the eyebrow and root of the nose, where they interlace mth the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, corrugator siipercilii and l^yramidalis nasi muscles, and terminate in the subcutaneous tissue. Some fasciculi are frec[uently attached to the nasal bone internally, and to the external angular process of the frontal bone on the outer side. The right and left muscular portions meet at tlie lower part of the forehead. The tendon or epicranial aponeurosis covers th.e upper part of tlie Aponeu- cranium, and is continuous across the middle line with the like .structure of the opposite half of the head. In front, it sends a pointed process downwards for some distance between the two muscular portions; and behind, it is prolonged between the posterior its attacli- bellies, to be attached to the occipital bone above the superior curved line. From its lateral margin the upper auricular muscles and rela- arise. Superficial to the aponeurosis are the vessels and nerves * Aluscles of the scalp and car. 1. Anterior, and 4, posterior belly of the occipito-frontalis. 15. Attollens aurem. 16. Attrahens aarem. 17. Eetra- hena aurem only partly seen.

TRIANGULAR LIGAMENT. is to be removed completely from the corpus spongiosum and tlie surface of the ligament, and the erector muscle from the crus of the penis. Next, the crus penis is to be detached from the bone ; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament nor to injure, near the pubic ramus, the terminal branches of the pudic artery and the nerve to the penis. The TRiANGULAE LIGAMENT OF THE URETHEA (deep perineal ^^^j'^l^'^" aponeurosis; fig. 134, c) occupies the anterior part of the sub-urethra: Fig. 134.* pubic arch, and is about one inch and a half in depth in the middle line. On each side it is fixed to the pubic and ischial rami beneath the attach- crus penis. Its base is turned towards the rectum, and in the mid- <lle line is imited with the centi-al point of the perineum ; while laterally it is free and sloped towards the bone, so that the ligament is deeper at the sides than in the centre. Superficial to it are the bulb of the corpus spongiosum and the crura of the penis, with the and mxisclea of the anteiior half of the perineal space ; and the super- ''^'-'^tion.s ficial fa,scia joins it along the hinder border. From its deep surface some fibres of the levator ani arise ; and the thin anal fascia is con- tinued backwards from the ligament over that muscle in the ischio- rectal fossa. â€¢ Deep dissection of the perineum {Illustrations of Dissections).

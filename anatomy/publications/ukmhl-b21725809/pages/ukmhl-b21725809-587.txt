INTEEIOR OF THE URETHRA. 573 gallinaginis) : it is formed of erectile substance, with, a framework of elixstic and muscular tissues. In the crest of the raucous mem- in the crest brane, near its posterior extremity, is a small hollow (e) named * P • vesicula prostatica^ sinus pocula'iHs, or utricle. The vesicnla prostatica (fig. Ill, g) is directed backwards in the "^^^f^^^'^j^^^ prostate, for a quarter of an inch, passing beneath the middle and theprostate, between the lateral lobes. Its orifice in the urethra is about a line wide, and its closed extremity is about as large again. Along tbe and by its Avall, on eacli side, is placed the common seminal duct (/), which ejaculatoiy terminates on or v/itbin the margin of the mouth of the sac ; and if ciucts. bristles are introduced into the common seminal duct behind the prostate, they will render the apertures evident. Small glands open on the surface of the mucous membrane lining the utricle. The vesicula is the remains of the united lower ends of the ducts of Miiller in the foetus, and represents the uterus in the female. On each side of the central crest is an excavation, which is named Prostatic the prostatic sinus (fig. 178,/). Into this hollow the greater number fnToor.* of the ducts of the prostatic glands open ; but the apertures of some are seen at the back of the central eminence. The MEMBRANOUS PART OF THE URETHRA (fig. 178, O) is three- Membi-an- ous part • quarters of an inch in length, and intervenes between the apex of the prostate gland and the b;ilb (/c) of the corpus spongiosiim urethrse. In its interior are slight longitudinal folds. This is the dimensioas; narrowest piece of the whole tube, with the exception of the outer orifice, and measures rather less than a quarter of an inch across. It is the weakest of the three portions of the canal, and is supported parts liy a thin stratum of erectile tissue, by a thin layer of unstriated circular fibres (p. 429), and outside all by the constrictor urethrae muscle. The SPONGY PART (fig. 178, i) reaches to the end of the penis. Spongy It is about six inches in length, and its strength depends upon a ' surroimding material named corpus spongiosum urethrae. The average size of the canal is about a quarter of an inch in dimensions diameter, though at the vertical slit (meatus urinarius), by which it terminates on the glans penis, the tube is smaller than elsewhere. On a cross section it appears star-shaped, but in the glans, as a vertical slit. Two dilations exist in the spongy portion ;—one istwodiiata- along the floor close to the triangidar ligament, being contained in on"irTbulb the bulb or bulbous part of the urethra, and is named sinus of thd one in glans; bulb ; the other is an elongated hollow, situate in the glans penis, and has been called fossa navicularis (n). There are many small pouches or lacunce (o) in the canal, as far lacunaj back as the membranous part,, which have their apertures turned towards the outer orifice of the urethra. One of these, larger than one larger the rest, lacuna marjna, is found generally immediately within the '^au the meatus, in the roof of the fossa navicularis. The ducts of Cowper's glands (fig. 178, h) are two in number. Ducts of and terminate, one on each side, on the floor of the urethra near the SJer'^ bulb ; but their openings are generally too small to be recognised. Mucous lining of the urethra.

By its inner surface the ganglion is in contact with the Eustachian tube, and at a little distance behind lies the large meningeal artery. In this ganglion, as in the others connected with the fifth nerve, filaments from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves are blended. Some tmgs are furnished by it to muscles. Connecting branchesâ€”roots. Through its connection T>dth the nerve to the internal pterygoid, the otic ganglion receives fibres from both the small and large roots of the inferior maxillary nerve, so that it Fig. 36.-' symi)a- thetic, seventh, ninth, auriculo- temporal, and chorda tyinpani. Branches to jnuscles; lensor tyinpani may be said to derive its motor and sensory roots from the fifth. Its sympathetic root comes from the plexus on the middle menin- geal artery. The ganglion is farther joined beliind by the small superficial petrosal nerve (^), through which fibres are conveyed to it from the facial and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. One or two short branches pass between the ganglion and the beginning of the auriculo-temporal nerve; and a filament descends to the chorda tympani. Branches to muscles. Two muscles receive their nerves through the otic ganglion, viz., tensor tympani and tensor jmlati.

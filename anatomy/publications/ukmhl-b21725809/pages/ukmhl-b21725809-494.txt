The ascending branch supplies the cojcum with the vermiform appendix and the beginning of tlie ascending colon, and anastomoses with the right colic artery; while the descending branch joins in a loop with the teimination of the mesenteric trunk, and distributes offsets to the lower end of the ileum. Right colic d. The right colic artery (d) is frequently conjoined at its origin pte ascend- preceding. Near the ascending colon it divides into ascend- ing colon, ing and descending branches, which anastomose with the ileo-colic artery on the one side, and with the middle colic on the other. Middle colic C- The middle colic branch (c) springs from the upper part of the passes'to ^^^'tery, and entering between the layers of the transverse meso- ti'ansverse colon, divides into two branches : the right one anastomoses with the Â«olon; artery to the ascending colon, and the left with the left colic branch of the inferior mesenteric arteiy (fig. 148, c).

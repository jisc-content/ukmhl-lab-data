The folds are largest and most unifonu beyond, and not far from the opening of the bile-duct. Opening of The aperture of the common bile and pancreatic ducts (fig.

A probe passed into, the bile-duct will show its oblique course (half an inch or more) tmder the mucous coat. Occasionally the pancreatic duct opens by a, distinct orifice. To see satisfactorily the following objects, some jneces of fresh intestine will be necessary. Villi. When a piece of the lower part of the duodenum, from which the mucus is washed away, is examined in water, the mucous membrane will be seen to be thickly studded with small pro- jections, like those on velvet. These bodies exist along the whole of the small intestine, and are irregular in form (fig. 155), some being triangular, others conical or cylindrical with a large end. Their length is from -^^th to -gV^h of an inch ; and they are best marked where the valvulce conniventes are largest. In the duode- and number, num their number is estimated at 50 to 90 in a square Une, but m the lower end of the ileum at only 40 to 70 on the same surfiice ^Krause). Glands.

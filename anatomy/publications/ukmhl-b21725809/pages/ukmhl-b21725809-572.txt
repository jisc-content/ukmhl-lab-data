DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 558 ItornI sacral arteries supply spinal brniielies. Ghiteal artery : The lateral sacral arteries (fig. 172, i) are commonly two in number, superior and inferior: they correspond in situation with the lumbar arteries, and form a chain of anastomoses by the side of the apertures in the sacrum. These arteries supply the pyriformis and coccygeus muscles, and anastomose with each other, as well as Avith the middle sacral. A sjnnal branch enters each aperture in the sacrum. The gluteal artery (fig. 172, m) is the continuation of the posterior Fig. 172.* division of the internal iliac, anil is destined for the gluteal musclei^ on the outer surface of the hip-bone. It is a short, thick trunk, which leaves the pehds through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, above the pyriformis muscle, with its accompanying vein and the small superior gluteal nerve. In the pelvis the artery gives small hranclms iidsets. to i\^Q contiguous muscles, viz., iliacus, jDyriformis, and obturator, and a twig to the hip-bone. * Dissection of the internal iliac artciy (Tiedemann).

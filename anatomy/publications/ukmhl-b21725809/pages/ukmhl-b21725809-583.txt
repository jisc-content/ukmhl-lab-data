569 STRUCTURE OF URINARY BLADDER. common seminal duct, it diminishes in size, and becomes straight. In the mucous lining are numerous tubular glands (Henle). G(mmon seminal diicts (fig. 177,/). These tubes (right and left) Semnmi^^ are formed by the junction of the narrowed part or duct of the formed: vesicula seminalis with the vas deferens of the same side. They begin op])osite the base of the prostate, and are directed downwards ^^^^^^. and forwai'ds through an aperture in the transverse prostatic fibres, and along the sides of the hollow (vesicula prostatica), to open into '• the urethral tube. Their length is rather less than an inch, and lengtii; their coui-se is convergent to their termination close to each other terminatior,; in the floor of the urethra (p. 573). Structure. The wall of the common duct is thinner than that of structure, the vesicula seminalis; but it possesses similar coats. It is sur- rounded by longitudinal involuntary muscular fibres, which blend in tlie urethra with the submucous stratum. THE BLADDER. After the bladder has been removed from the pelvis, its form Bladder out and the extent of its different regions can be more conveniently " studied. While the bladder is in the body, it is OA^oidal in shape, and form; rather flattened from above down; but out of the body it is rounder than when in its natural position, and it loses that arched form by which it adapts itself in distension to the curve of the pelvis. If this viscus is moderately dilated, it measures about five inches dimensions, in length, and three inches across (Huschke). Its capacity is greatly influenced by the age and habits of the individual. Ordin- arily the bladder holds about a pint mthout inconvenience during life, though it can contain much more when distended. Structure. A muscular and a mucous coat, with an intervening Coats of the fibrous layer, exist in the wall of the bladder : at certain parts the ^i^^*^®^'- peritoneum may be also enumerated as a constituent of the wall. The vessels and nerves are large. The imperfect covering of ^en'<o?}e?m has been described (p.'546). Peritoneal. The muscular coat is formed of thin layers of unstriated muscular Muscular fibres, viz., an external or longitudinal, a middle or circular, and an g^^ta'^^^ internal or submucous. The Imcjitudinal fibres (fig. 176, ^) form a continuous covering, External or with the usual plexiform disposition of the muscular bundles, and naif extend from apex to base. Above, some are connected with the attach- urachus, and the subperitoneal fibrous tissue. Below, the posterior'"^"*'*' and lateral fibres enter the prostate ; while the anterior are attached to the fascia covering the prostate, but a fasciculus on each side is united to the back of the pubis through the anterior true ligament of the bladder. On the front and back of the bladder the muscular layer is stronger, and its fibres more vertical than on the sides, forms Sometimes this outer layer of fibres is called detrusor iLrince from its uh"?""" action in the expulsion of the urine.

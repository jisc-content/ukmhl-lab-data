291 BRANCHES OF ULNAR ARTERY. Its ■branches are muscular, anterior and posterior recurrent On the anmdar ligament the artery has passed through the fascia, P-^it^on- and lies close to the pisiform bone. The ulnar nerve, with its palmar iig„,uent. branch, still accompanies the vessel on the inner side. Bmnchct^. The greater number of the ofl^ets of the artery are distributed / to the muscles. Its named branches are the follow- ing :— "(T. The anterior ulnar recurrent branch frequently arises in common with the next, and ascends on the braciiialis anticus muscle, to join the branch of the anastomotic artery beneath the pronator teres. It gives offsets to the conti- guous muscles. b. The posterior ulnar recuirent branch {d), of larger size than the ante- rior, is directed beneath the flexor subliniis muscle to the interval between the inner condyle and the olecranon. There it passes with the ulnar nerve be- tween the attachments of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and joins the ramifica- tions of the inferior pro- funda and anastomotic arteries on the inner side of the elbow-joint. Some of its offsets enter the muscles, and others supply the articulation and the ulnar nerve. c. The interosseous artery is a short thick trunk, which is directed back- wards towards the inter- osseous membrane, and divides into anterior and posterior branches : the two divisions will be afterwards followed. * Dissection of tlie deep muscles of the forearm, and of the vessels and nerves between the two groups of muscles.

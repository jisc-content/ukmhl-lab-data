DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 694 Anterior ligament is tendon of the extensor. Open the knee-joint in front The anterior ligament or ligamentum patellce (fig. 213, ^) is 'part of the tendon of insertion of the extensor muscle of the knee (p. 620). About two inches long, it is attached above to the apex and lower border of the j)ateUa ; and below to the tubercle of the tibia. An expansion of the triceps extensor covers it; and a bursa intervenes between it and the front of the tibia above the tubercle. Dissection (fig. 214). To see the refl.ection8 of the syno\dal mem- brane, raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an incision on each side, above the patella. When the anterior portion of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) Fig. 214. and behind. Synovial membrane will be seen extending from the intercondylar fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is another fold (alar ligament) over some fat. The limb may be laid flat on the table, and some of the posterior ligament removed, to show the pouches of the syno-^dal membrane which project behind over the condyles of the femur ; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the parts are learnt. The synovial membrane (fig. 214) lines the interior of the joint, and is continued to the margins of the articular siu'faces of the bones. It invests the interarticular fibro-cartilages after the manner of serous membranes, and sends a pouch between the tendon of the popliteus and the external fibro-cartilage and the head of the tibia ; it is also reflected over the strong crucial ligaments at the back of the joint. * The capsule of the knee-joint cut across, and the patella thrown down, to show the named folds of the synovial sac. a. Mucous ligament, b. Internal, and c. External alar ligament.

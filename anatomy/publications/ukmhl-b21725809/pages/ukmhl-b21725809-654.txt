The INFERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE is larger than the superior, and arises from the upper part of the sacral plexus (fig. 196, igj. The short trunk is directed backwards below the pyriformis, and divides Fig. 196.* into numerous branches which radiate upwards and downwards, and enter the gluteus maximus midway between its origin and insertion. Small sciatic The SMALL SCIATIC (fig. 195/) is a cutaneous nerve of tlie back crasnerve^" thigh. It springs from the second and third sacral nerves (fig. 196, ss), and takes the course of the sciatic artery as far as the lower border of the great gluteus, where it gives many cutaneous branches. Much diminished in size at that spot, the nerve is con- tinued along the back of the thigh beneath the fascia, and ends * Diagram of the sacraJ plexus from behind. LSC.

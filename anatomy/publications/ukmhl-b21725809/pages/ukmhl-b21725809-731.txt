717 SCLEROTIC COAT. Fiisuous Oo\T OP THK Eyeball. The outer casing of tlie eye consists of nn opaciue hinder part called sclerotic, and of an anterior transparent portion, the cornea. The SCLEROTIC is the firm, whitish, opaque portion of the outer coat of tlie eyeball, which supports the more delicate structiires within. THssection. To examine the inner and outer surfaces of this layer, Fig. 223.*** Fibrous coat. Sclerotic part. Dissection to see the interior. it will be necessary to cut circularly with a scissors through the cornea close to the sclerotic, and to remove the cornea from the front of the eyeball; on piercing the cornea the aqueous fluid escapes from the containing chamber. The other structiires may be then abstracted from the interior of the sclerotic covering, and may be set aside with the cornea for subsequent use. The sclerotic tunic of the eye (fig. 223, a) extends from the Extent of entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the cornea, forming ^'-'^^rotic; about fiA^e-sixths of the ball. At its back, and a little to the inner side of the centre (one-tenth apertures of an inch), the optic nerve (l) is transmitted through an aperture in it : this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is cril>riform when the nerve is drawn out,â€”the lattice-like condition being due to the bundles of fibrous tissue between the funiculi of * Diagram of a liorizontal section of tlie eyeball, a.

641 BRANCHES OF THE SACRAL PLEXUS. below the knee in the integuments of the back of the leg (p. 662). ends iii the The branches distributed to, or near the buttock, are the follow- ing The ascending or gluteal cutaneous branches (fig. 194) turn upwards ascending roimd the border of the gluteus maximus, and are distributed to the skin over the lower third of the muscle. The descending cutaneous branches (fig. 194,^) supply the integu- ments of the upper third of the thigh at the inner and posterior ^.^^^^^^^^^3 aspects. One of these branches (fig. 195, ^), which is larger than the branches; others, is distributed to the genital organs, and is named inferior inferior pudendal (p. 425); as it courses to the perineiun, it turns below the jierye"'^^^ ischial tuberosity, and perforates the fascia lata at the inner side of the thigh to end in the scrotum. The GREAT SCIATIC (fig. 195,") is the largest nerve in the body. Great sciatic It is the source of all the muscular, and most of the cutaneous ^^^^/^ . branches to the limb beyond the knee, as well as of the muscular branches at the back of the thigh. At its origin it appears to be a prolongation of the sacral plexus (fig. 196, ^s). It is directed through the buttock to the back of course in the thigh, and rests on the external rotator muscles below the pyriformis. Commonly it does not supply any branch to the no branch iu buttock, but it may give origin to one or two filaments to the hip- i^gio"- joint. Frequently the nerve is divided into two large trunks at its origin, and one of them (the external popliteal) pierces the fibres of the pyriformis muscle. The PUDic NERVE (fig. 195,*) winds over the small sacro-sciatic Pudlc nerve, ligament by the side of its companion artery, and is distributed vnth. this vessel to the perineum and the genital organs (p. 421).

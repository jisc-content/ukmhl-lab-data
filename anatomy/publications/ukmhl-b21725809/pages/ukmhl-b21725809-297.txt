The MUSCULO-SPIRAL NERVE (fig. 72,^) is the largest trunk of the Mu.scu1o- posterior cord of the brachial plexus (p. 256), and is continued along ^inds'^^^^* the back and outer part of the limb to the hand. In the arm the nerve winds with the superior profunda artery beneath the triceps muscle. At the outer aspect of the arm it is continued between the outer side brachialis anticus and supinator longus muscles to the external condyle °^ ' of the humerus, in front of which it divides into the radial and posterior interosseous nerves (fig. 92,- and ^). The nerve gives branches, muscular branches, and the following cutaneous offsets to the inner and oiiter sides of the limb. a. The internal cutaneous Iranch of the arm (fig. 82,is of small internal size, and arises in the axillary space in common with the branch to ^^l^^i^^ the inner head of the triceps ; it is directed across the j)osterior boundaiy of the axilla to the inner side of the arm, where it becomes cutaneous in the upper tlxu'd, and is distributed as before said (pp. 272 and 284), b.

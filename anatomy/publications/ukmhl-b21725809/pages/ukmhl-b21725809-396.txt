Eolation is the twisting of the bodies of the verteljrae around a vertical axis through their centres, the fore part being turned to the right or left, while the lower articular processes glide in the opposite direction over the upper of the next bone below. The movement will obviously be checked by the tightening of one set of oblique fibres in the intervertebral disc. A pure rotation of this kind, however, small extent in the upper dorsal region ; but degree of turning movement is permitted lateral flexion, owing to the conformation In the loins the articular surfaces are so impossible. of takes place only to a in the neck a greater in combination with the articular surfaces. disjiosed that rotation is

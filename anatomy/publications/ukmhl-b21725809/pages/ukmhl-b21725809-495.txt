481 INFERIOR MESENTERIC VESSELS. twigs are united in arches before entering tlie gut, like those to the small intestine. The supei-ior mesenteric vein (fig. 150, 6) is formed by the iinion Superior of branches from the intestine corresponding to the offsets of the vein, artery. The trunk passes beneath the pancreas on the right side of the ai-tery, and there joins the splenic vein to form the vena portaj. At the lower border of the pancreas it receives the right gastro- epiploic branch from the stomach (fig. 150, c). The MESENTERIC LYMPHATIC GLANDS are numerous between the Mesenteric layers of the mesentery. An upper group lies by the side of the artery, and contains the largest glands ; and a lower group, near the intestine, is lodged in the intervascular spaces. The chyliferous lympliatics vessels of the small intestine, and the absorbents of the part of them™^ the large intestine supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, pass through the mesenteric glands in their course to the thoracic duct. Along the side of the ascending and the transverse colon are a few Meso-colic other small lymphatic glands, meso-colic, which receive some absorb- s^^"*^^' ents of the large intestine. Dissection (fig. 148). By drawing the small intestine over to the Dissection ' . . . of inferior right side, the dissector will observe the inferior mesenteric artery mesenteric on the front of the aorta, a little above the bifurcation. The peri- artery, toneum should be removed from its surface, and the branches should be traced outwards to the remaining half of the large intes- tine : a part of the artery enters the pelvis, but this will be dis- sected afterwards. On the artery and its branches the inferior mesenteric plexus of nerves ramifies. The inferior mesenteric vein is to be followed upwards beneath vein: the pancreas to its junction with the superior mesenteric or the splenic vein. On the aorta the dissector will meet with a plexus of nerves, aortic which is to be left uninjured. The INFERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY (fig. 148, h) Supplies branches inferior to the large intestine beyond the transverse colon, and communica- .™tery*:^"'' ting with the superior mesenteric, continues the chain of anastomoses along the intestinal tube. This vessel is of smaller size than the superior mesenteric, and origin, arises from the aorta from one to two inches above the bifurcation. It descends, lying at first on, and then close to the left side of the aorta, and after giving off branches to the descending colon and the and sigmoid flexure, terminates as the superior hsemorrhoidal artery to branches, the rectum, a. The left colic artery (c) passes out in front of the left kidney, Left colic and divides into an ascending and a descending branch for the Jelceidtng supply of the descending colon : by the ascending offset it anasto- colon > moses with the middle colic branch of the superior mesenteric, h. The sigmoid artery (d) is distributed to the sigmoid flexure, Sigmoid and divides into oS'sets which anastomose above with the preceding ^''^i^ch colic, and below with the haemorrhoidal branch. Here, as in the sigmoid rest of the intestinal tube, arches are formed by the arteries before flexm-e. they reach the intestine, 1 I

INTERNAL PLANTAR ARTERY. 6/ hallucis. Its superficial digital branches accompany the digital j^j^f^Wj; nerves of the internal plantar (fig. 206), and are thus disposed of :â€” The first is distributed to the inner side of the foot and great fii'st. toe ; the second lies over the first interosseous space ; the third second, corresponds Avith the second sj)ace ; and the fourth is placed over the third space. At the root of the toes the last three join, the deeper digital arteries in those spaces. * First view of the sole of the foot (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles : A. Abductor hallucis. b.

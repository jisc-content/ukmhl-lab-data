Be- liind the crest of bone, near the common opening of two of the semicircular canals, is the aperture of the aqueduct of the vestibule (c), a narrow canal which ends on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone : it contains a process of the membra- nous labyrinth called the ductus endolpnphaticus, and a small vein. Fig. 236.* The roof is occupied by a slight transversely oval depression, fossa in roof. fovea heniielliptica; this is separated from the fovea hemispherica by a prolongation of the crest (6) on the inner wall. The SEMICIRCULAR CANALS (fig. 237) are three osseous tubes, ^'u-ee semi- circulfti' Avhich are situate behind the vestibule, and are named from their canals: form. Dissection. These small canals will be easily brought into view preparation by the removal of the surrounding bone by means of a file or bone Â° ^^^"^' forceps. Two may be seen opening near the ajjerture made in the vestibule, and may be followed thence ; but the third is altogether towards the posterior aspect of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The canals are unequal in length, and each forms more than haK lengtii; an ellipse. They communicate at each end with the vestibule, but termination the contiguous ends of two are blended together so as to give only hfgsj'' five openings into that cavity. Each is marked by one dilated one end extremity which is called the ampulla.

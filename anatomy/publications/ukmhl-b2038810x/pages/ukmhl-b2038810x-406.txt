268 MUSCLES AND FASCIAE. the arm is raised, it draws the humerus downwards. It is a powerful defence to the front of the shoulder-joint, preventing displacement of the head of the bone forwards. Posterior Scapular Region. (Fig. 171.) Supraspinatus. Teres Minor. Infraspinatus. Teres Major. Dissection, To expose these muscles, and to examine their mode of insertion into the humerus, detach the Deltoid and Trapezius from their attachment to the spine of the scapula and acromion process. Remove the clavicle by dividing the ligaments connecting- it with the coraco:d process, and separate it at its articulation with its scapula: divide the acromion process near its root with a saw. The fragments being removed, the tendons of the posterior Scapular muscles will be fully exposed, and can be examined. A block should be placed beneath the shoulder-joint, so as to make the muscles tense. The supraspinous aponeurosis is a thick and dense membranous layer, which completes the osseo-fibrous case in which the Supraspinatus muscle is contained affording attachment, by its inner surface, to some of the fibres of the muscle. It 171.â€”Muscles on the Dorsum of the Scapula and the Triceps. is thick internally, but thinner externally under the coraco-acromial ligament. When this fascia is removed, the Supraspinatus muscle is exposed. The Supraspdnatus muscle occupies the whole of the supraspinatus fossa, arising from its internal two-thirds, and from the strong fascia which covers its surface. The muscular fibres converge to a tendon, which passes across the capsular liga- ment of the shoulder-joint, to which it is intimately adherent, and is inserted into the highest of the three facets or the great tuberosity of the humerus. Relations. By its upper surface, with the Trapezius, the clavicle, the acromion, the coraco-acromial ligament, and the Deltoid. By its under surface, with the

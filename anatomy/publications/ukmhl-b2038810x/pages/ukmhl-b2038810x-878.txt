SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 74° If traced downwards, it is found continuous with another curved margin, the concavity of which is directed upwards and inwards ; this is the inferior cornu of the saphenous opening, and is blended with the pubic portion of the fascia lata covering the Pectineus muscle. The inner boundary of the opening is on a plane posterior to the outer margin, and behind the level of the femoral vessels ; it is much less prominent and defined than the outer, from being stretched over the subjacent Pectineus muscle. It is through the saphenous opening that a femoral hernia passes after descending along the crural canal. If the finger is introduced into the saphenous opening while the limb is moved in different directions, the aperture will be found to be greatly constricted on extending the limb, or rotating it outwards, and to be relaxed on flexing the limb and inverting it: hence the necessity of placing the limb in the latter position in employing the taxis for the reduction of a femoral hernia. The iliac portion of the fascia lata, together with its falciform process, should now be removed, by detaching- it from the lower margin of Poupart's ligament, carefully dissecting- it from the subjacent structures, and turning- it aside when the sheath of the femoral vessels is exposed descending beneath Poupart's ligament (fig. 402). 402.—Femoral Hernia. Iliac Portion of Fascia Lata removed, and Sheath of Femoral Vessels and Femoral Canal exposed. The Crural Arch, or Poupart's Ligament, is the lower border of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle, which stretches across from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, to the spine of the os pubis and pectineal line : the portion corresponding to the latter insertion is called GimhernaVs Ligament.

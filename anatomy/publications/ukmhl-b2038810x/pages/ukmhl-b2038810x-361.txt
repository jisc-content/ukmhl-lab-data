223 SUPERFICIAL CERVICAL REGION. This muscle divides the quadrilateral space at the side of the neck into two triangles, an anterior and a posterior. The boundaries of the anterior triangle are in front, the median line of the neck; above, the lower border of the body of the jaw, and an imaginary line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the mastoid process ; behind, the anterior border of the Sterno-mastoid muscle. The boundaries of the posterior triangle are, in front, the posterior border of the Sterno-mastoid ; below, the upper border of the clavicle; behind, the anterior margin of the Trapezius. * 153.â€”Muscles of the Neck, and Boundaries of the Triangles. The anterior edge of the muscle forms a very prominent ridge beneath the kin, which it is important to notice, as it forms a guide to the surgeon in making he necessary incisions for ligature of the common carotid artery, and for Relations. By its superficial surface, with the integument and Platysma, from phich it is separated by the external jugular vein, the superficial branches of the ervical plexus, and the anterior layer of the deep cervical fascia. By its deep urface, it rests on the sterno-clavicular articulation, the deep layer of the cervical iscia, the Sterno-hyoid, Sterno-thyroid, Omo-hyoid, the posterior belly of the Agastric, Levator anguli scapulae, the Splenius and Scaleni muscles. Below, it 5 in relation with the lower part of the common carotid artery, internal jugular em, pneumogastric, descendens noni and communicans noni nerves, and with the eep lymphatic glands; with the spinal accessory nerve, which pierces its upper iird, the cervical plexus, the occipital artery, and a part of the parotid gland. Ne rves. The Platysma myoides is supplied by the facial and superficial branches * The anatomy of these trianples will be more exactly described with that of the vessels the neck. c J

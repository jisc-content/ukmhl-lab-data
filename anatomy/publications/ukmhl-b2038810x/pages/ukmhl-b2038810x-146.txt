8 THE SKELETON. The Ninth Dorsal has no demi-facet below. In some subjects, however, the ninth has two demi-facets on each side, then the tenth has a demi-facet at the upper part; none below. The Tenth Dorsal has (except in the cases just mentioned) an entire articular facet on each side above ; it has no demi-facet below. In the Eleventh Dorsal, the body approaches in its form and size to the lumbar. The articular facets for the heads of the ribs, one on each side, are of large size, •Peculiar Dorsal V ;brse.

The transverse pro- cesses are very short, tubercular at their extremities, and have no articular facets for the tubercles of the ribs. The spinous process is short, nearly horizontal in direction, and presents a slight tendency to bifurcation at its extremity. The Tivelfth Dorsal has the same general characters as the eleventh ; but may

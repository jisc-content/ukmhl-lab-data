232 MUSCLES AND FASCLE. The Levator Palati is a long, thick, rounded muscle, placed on the outer side of the posterior nares. It arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and from the adjoining cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube; after passing into the pharynx, above the upper concave margin of the Superior constrictor-, it descends obliquely downwards and inwards, its fibres spreading out in the posterior surface of the soft palate as far as the middle line, where they blend with those of the opposite side. 157.â€”Muscles of the Soft Palate. The Pharynx being laid open from behind. Relations. Externally, with the Tensor palati and Superior constrictor. Inter- nally, with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. Posteriorly, with the mucous lining of the soft palate. This muscle must be removed and the pterygoid j attachment of the Superior constrictor dissected away, in order to expose the next I muscle. The Oircumflexus or Tensor Palati is a broad, thin, riband-like muscle, placed on the outer side of the preceding, and consisting of a vertical and a horizontal portion. The vertical portion arises by a broad, thin, and flat lamella from the scaphoid fossa at the base of the internal pterygoid plate, its origin extending as far back as the spine of the sphenoid ; it also arises from the anterior aspect of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube ; descending vertically between the internal pterygoid plate and the inner surface of the Internal pterygoid muscle, it terminates in a tendon which winds round the hamular process, being retained in this situation by some of the fibres of origin of the Internal pterygoid muscle, and lubricated by a bursa. The tendon or horizontal portion then passes horizontal!- :

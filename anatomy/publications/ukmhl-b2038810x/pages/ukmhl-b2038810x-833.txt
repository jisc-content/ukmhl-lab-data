THE KIDNEYS. b95 circumference of the kidney. Pyramids so formed are called the ' 'pyramids of Ferrew.' They have also been named ' lobnles of the kidney,' and the vessels which run between them ' interlobular.' The student must not confound these with the lobes mentioned on p. 692, of which the foetal kidney is composed. The pyramids of Ferrein are found in the cortical arches only, and were considered by Ferrein as quite distinct; but although they are for the most part separated by interlobular vessels and two rows of Malpighian bodies, yet it is now generally admitted that certain tubes of adjacent lobules intercommunicate. In the columns of Bertini no definite lobular arrangement is said to exist, on account of the absence of straight tubes ; the tubuli contorti of those parts meeting the tubuli rectPat the base of the Malpighian pyramids, and not at the sides adjacent. 382.*—Transverse Section of Pyramidal Substance of Kidney of Pig, the blood- vessels of which are injected. .

In the tubuli contorti it is more or less spheroidal; in the straight tubes and the ascending or larger limb of Henle's loop, large and cloudy, being of the cubical variety; whilst in the descending limb it is smaller and transparent, closely resembling the endothelium of blood-vessels, From the < Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory.'

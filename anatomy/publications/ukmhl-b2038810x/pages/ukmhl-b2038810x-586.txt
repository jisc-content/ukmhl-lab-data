VEINS. 448 splenic veins, their union taking place in front of the vena cava, and behind the upper border of the great end of the pancreas. Passing upwards through the right border of the lesser omentum to the under surface of the liver, it enters the transverse fissure, where it is somewhat enlarged, forming the sinus of the portal vein, and divides into two branches, which accompany the ramifications of the hepatic artery and hepatic duct throughout the substance of the liver. Of these two branches the right is the larger but the shorter of the two. The portal vein, is about four inches in length, and, whilst contained in the lesser omentum, lies behind and between the hepatic duct and artery, the former being to the right, the latter to the left. These structures are accompanied by filaments of the hepatic plexus of nerves, and numerous lymphatics, surrounded by a quantity of loose 246.—Portal Vein and its Branches. areolar tissue (capsule of Glisson), and placed between the layers of the lesser omentum. The vena portae receives the gastric and cystic veins ; the latter vein sometimes terminates in the right branch of the vena portae. Within the liver the portal vein receives the blood from the branches of the hepatic artery.

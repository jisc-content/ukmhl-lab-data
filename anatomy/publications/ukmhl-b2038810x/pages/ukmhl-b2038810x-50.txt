GENERAL ANATOMY. xliy tkm of the blood-vessel s, glands, and, in fact, almost every organ in the hod}'. The organs which are formed almost exclusively of the yellow elastic tissue are the ligamenta subflava of the vertebrae, the elastic ligaments of the larynx, the longitudinal elastic fibres of the trachea, the elastic layer of the middle coat of the arteries, and in quadrupeds the ligamentum nuchse. Free cells are found in the areolar tissue, as indicated above. The chief forms are the spindle-shaped and the stellate, but numerous intermediate Fig. VI.—Yellow elastic tissue. High power.

Recldingshausen's discovery in the cellular tissue of cold- blooded animals of 'wandering cells,' or cells endowed with the power of automatic motion, and of changing their shape. These cells appear identical with the white globules of the blood; and it would seem from the researches of Strieker, Cohnheim, and others, that the wall of the capillary vessels are permeable to the latter bodies, which are thus allowed to escape into the cellular tissue, there to undergo development, normally into the natural cells and cellular tissue, or abnormally into the corpuscular forms of lymph and pus, according to circumstances."* * On this subject reference maybe made to v. Becklingshausen, in Virchow's Archiv. Bd. xxviii., and Rollett, in Strieker's Human and Comparative Histology, translated by Power, chap, ii., where the reader will find references to Strieker, Cohnheim, Kiihne, and others.

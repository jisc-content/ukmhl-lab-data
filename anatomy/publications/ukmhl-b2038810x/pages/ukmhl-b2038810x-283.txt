SESAMOID BONES. 145 and one in the Psoas and Iliacus, where they glide over the body of the pubes. Sesamoid bones are found occasionally in the tendon of the Biceps, opposite the tuberosity of the radius ; in the tendon of the Gluteus maximus, as it passes over the great trochanter; and in the tendons which wind round the inner and outer malleoli. The author has to acknowledge valuable aid derived from the perusal of the works of Cloquet, Cruveilhier, Bourgery, and Boyer, especially of the latter. Reference has also been made to the following:—' Outlines of Human Osteology/ by F. O. Ward. 1A Treatise on the Human Skeleton, and Observations on the Limbs of Vertebrate Animals,' by G. M. Humphry. Holden's' Human Osteology.' Henle's' Handbuch der systematischen Anatomie des Menschen. Erster Band. Erste Abtheilung. Knochenlekre.' ' Osteological Memoirs (The Clavicle),' by Struthers. 'On the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton/ and ' On the Nature of Limbs,'by Owen.—Todd and Bowman's ' Physiological Anatomy/ and Kolliker's ' Manual of Human Microscopic Anatomy/ contain the most complete account of the structure and development of bone.—The development of the bones is minutely described in Quain's ' Anatomy,' edited by Sharpey and Ellis.—On the chemical analysis of bone, refer to Lehmann's 'Physiological Chemistry/ translated by Day ; vol. iii. p. 12. Simon's 'Chemistry/ translated by Bay; vol. ii. p. 396.

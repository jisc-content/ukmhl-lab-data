439 BRANCHES OF SUPERIOR CAVA. the following1: The communicating branch between the two trunks enlarges and forms the future left innominate vein; the remaining part of the left trunk is obliterated as far as the heart, where it remains 24i.-The Venae Cava, and Azvgos Veins, Pervious> and forms th+e f"0' with their Formative Branches. n«7 8infu^ 5 a r€f™nt of obliterated vessel is seen in adult life as a fibrous band Anterior Jugular- passing along the back of the left auricle and in front of the root of the left lung, called by Mr. Marshall the vestigial fold of the pericardium. The internal mammary veins, two in number to each artery, follow the course of that vessel, and receive branches corres- ponding with those derived from it. The two veins unite into a single trunk, which terminates in the innominate vein. The inferior thyroid veins, two, frequently three or four in number, arise in the venous plexus, on the thyroid body, communicat- ing with the middle and superior thyroid veins. The left one descends in front of the trachea, behind the Sterno-thyroid muscles, communicating with its fellow by transverse branches, and terminates in the left vena innomi- nata. The right one, which is placed a little to the line, right vena right of the median opens into the innominata, just at its junction with the superior cava. These veins receive tracheal and inferior laryn- geal branches, and are provided with valves at their termination in the innominate veins. The Superior Inter- costal Veins return the blood from the upper in- tercostal spaces. The right stiperior in- tercostal, much smaller than the left, closely corre- sponds with the superior intercostal artery, receiv- ing the blood from the first, or first and second inter-

ARTERIES. The pyloric branch arises from the hepatic, above the pylorus, descends to the pyloric end of the stomach, and passes from right to left along its lesser curvature, supplying it with branches, and inosculating with the gastric artery. The gastro-duodenalis (fig. 224) is a short but large branch, whicli descends behind the duodenum, near the pylorus, and divides at the lower border of the stomach into two branches, the gastro-epiploica dextra and the pancreatico- duodenalis. Previous to its division, it gives off two or three small inferior pyloric branches to the pyloric end of the stomach and pancreas. The gastro-epiploica dextra runs from, right to left along the greater curvature of the stomach, between the layers of the great omentum, anastomosing about the middle of the lower border of the stomach with the gastro-epiploica sinistra from the splenic artery. This vessel gives off numerous branches, some of which ascend 223.â€”The Coeliac Axis and its Branches, the Liver having been raised, and the Lesser Omentum removed. to supply both surfaces of the stomach, whilst others descend to supply the great omentum. The pancreatico-duodenalis superior descends along the contiguous margins of the duodenum and pancreas. It supplies both these organs, and anastomoses with the inferior pancreatico-duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. In ulceration of the duodenum, which frequently occurs in connection with severe burns, this artery may be involved, and death may occur from hemorrhage into the intestinal canal. The cystic artery (fig. 223), usually a branch of the right hepatic, passes upwards and forwards along the neck of the gall bladder, and divides into two branches,

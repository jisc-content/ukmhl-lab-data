GENERAL ANATOMY. xcviii urethra, the vas deferens, the prostate, Cowper's glands, Bartholine's glands, and a portion of the uterine mucous membrane. The spheroidal or glandular epithelium (Fig. X.LII.) is composed of circular cells, with granular contents and a small nucleus. Fig. XLI.—Epithelium of the intestinal villi of the rabbit, a, Basement-membrane. Magnified 300 times. This form is found in the kidney, ureters and "bladder, and in the secreting glands. Ciliated epithelium (Fig. XLITI.) maybe of any of the preceding forms, but usually inclines to the columnar shape. It is distinguished by the presence of minute processes, like hairs or eyelashes (cilia), standing up from the free surface. If the cells be examined during life, or immediately Fig. XLII.—Spheroidal epithelium from the human bladder Mag- nified 250 times. Fig. XLIII.—Ciliated epithelium, from the human trachea.

The situations in which ciliated epithelium is found in the human body ! are: the respiratory tract from the nose downwards, the tympanum and Eustachian tube, the Fallopian tube and upper portion of the uterus, and the ventricles of the brain.

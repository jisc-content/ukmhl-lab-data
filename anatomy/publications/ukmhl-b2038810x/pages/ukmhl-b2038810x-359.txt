A block having been placed at the back of the neck, and the face turned to i the side opposite to that to be dissected, so as to place the parts upon the stretch, make two I transverse incisions: one from the chin, along the margin of the lower jaw, to the mastoid jprocess ; and the other along the upper border of the clavicle. Connect these by an oblique jincision made in the course of the Sterno-mastoid muscle, from the mastoid process to the {sternum; the two flaps of integument having been removed in the direction shown in fig. 147, the superficial fascia will be exposed. The superficial cervical fascia is exposed on the removal of the integument from the side of the neck ; it is an extremely thin aponeurotic lamina, which is hardly demonstrable as a separate membrane. Beneath it is found the Platysma myoides muscle, the external jugular vein, and some superficial branches of the cervical plexus of nerves. The Platysma Myoides (fig. 148) is a broad thin plane of muscular fibres, placed immediately beneath the skin on each side of the neck. It arises from the clavicle aÂ»d-acromi^m,_and from the fascia covering the upper part of the Pectoral, Deltoid, ind Trapezius muscles ; its fibres proceed obliquely upwards and inwards along bhe side of the neck, to be inserted into the lower jaw beneath the external oblique line, some passing forwards to the angle of the mouth, and others becoming lost in the cellular tissue of the face. The most anterior fibres interlace, in front 3f the jaw, with the fibres of the muscle of the opposite side ; those next in order become blended with the Depressor labii inferioris and the Depressor anguli oris ; Dthers are prolonged upon the side of the cheek, and interlace, near the angle of bhe mouth, with the muscles in this situation, and may occasionally be traced to jhe Zygomatic muscles, or to the margin of the Orbicularis palpebrarum. Beneath ;he Platysma, the external jugular vein may be seen descending from the angle of ;he jaw to the clavicle. It is essential to remember the direction of the fibres )f the Platysma, in connection with the operation of bleeding from this vessel; ?or if the point of the lancet is introduced in the direction of the muscular fibres, phe orifice made will be filled up by the contraction of the muscle, and blood will lot flow; but if the incision is made across the course of the fibres, they will 'etract, and expose the orifice in the vein, and so facilitate the flow of blood. Relations. By its external Surface, with the integument, to which it is united ilosely below, but more loosely above. By its internal surface, with the 3ectoralis major, Deltoid, and Trapezius, and with the clavicle. In the neck, vith the external and anterior jugular veins, the deep cervical fascia, the superf- icial branches of the cervical plexus, the Sterno-mastoid, Sterno-hyoid,Omo-hyoid, ^nd Digastric, muscles. In front of the Sterno-mastoid, it covers the sheath >f the carotid vessels; and behind it, the Scaleni muscles and the nerves of the >rachial plexus. On the face, it is in relation with the parotid gland, the facial artery and vein, and the Masseter and Buccinator muscles. The deep cervical fascia is exposed on the removal of the Platysma myoides.

'The Phalanges are each developed by two centres: one for the shaft, and one for the base. Ossification commences in the shaft, in all three rows, at about the sixth week, and gradually involves the whole of the bone excepting the upper extremity. Ossification of the base commences in the first row between the third and fourth years, and a year later in those of the second and third rows. The two centres become united in each row, between the eighteenth and twentieth years. Of the Lower Extremity. The Lower Extremity consists of three segments, the thigh, leg, and foot, which correspond to the arm, forearm, and hand in the upper extremity. It is connected to the trunk through the os innominatum, or haunch, which is homologous with the shoulder. The Os Innominatum. The Os Innominatum, or nameless bone, so called from bearing no resemblance to any known object, is a large irregular-shaped bone, which, with its fellow of the

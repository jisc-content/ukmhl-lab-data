SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. 75° The superficial and transverse perinaeal arteries are described at p. 404; and the superficial perineal and inferior pudendal nerves at pp. 549, 551. The muscles of the perinasum in the female are, the Sphincter vaginae. Compressor urethras. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter ani. Transversus perineei. Levator ani. Coccygeus. The Sphincter Vaginae surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinse in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perinseum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forward on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perineei is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginae, and the Levator ani into the side of the vagina. The other muscles are precisely similar to those in the male. The Accelerator urinae and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinaeal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating- its centre, just behind the bulb ; and on either side is the cms penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. ; 407.—Deep Perinaeal Fa«cia. On the left side, the anterior layer has been removed. The Deep Perineeal Fascia (triangular ligament), is a dense membranous lamina, which closes the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. It is triangular in shape, about an inch and a half in depth, attached above, by its apex, to the under surface of the symphysis pubis and subpubic ligament; and, on each side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, benvath the crura penis. Its inferior

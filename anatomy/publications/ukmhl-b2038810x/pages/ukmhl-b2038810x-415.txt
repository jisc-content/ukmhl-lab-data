277 ANTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. 173.â€”Front of the Left Forearm. Deep Muscles. diately below the tuberosity and oblique line, and ex- tending, below, to witbin a short distance of the Prona- tor qnadratus. It also arises from the adjacent part of the interosseous membrane, and occasionally by a fleshy slip from the base of the coronoid process. The fibres pass downwards, and terminate in a flattened tendon, which passes beneath the annular ligament, is then lodged in the interspace between the two heads of the Flexor brevis pollicis, and entering an osseo-aponeu- rotic canal similar to those for the other flexor tendons, is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. Relations. By'its superficial surface, with the Flexor sub- limit digitorum, Flexor carpi radialis, Supinator Longusand radial vessels. By its deep surface, with the radius, interosseous membrane, and Pronator quadratus. By its ulnar border, with the Flexor profundus digitorum, from which it is separated by the anterior interosseous vessels and nerve. The Pronator Quadratics is a small, flat, quadrilateral muscle, extending trans- versely across the front of the radius and ulna, above their carpal extremities. It arises from the oblique line on the lower fourth of the anterior surface of the shaft of the ulna, and the surface of bone immediately below it; from the anterior border of the ulna ; and from a strong aponeurosis which covers the inner third of the muscle. The fibres pass horizontally outwards, to be inserted into the lower fourth of the an- terior surface and external border of the shaft of the radius. Relations. By its supcrjicia I surface, with the Flexor pro-

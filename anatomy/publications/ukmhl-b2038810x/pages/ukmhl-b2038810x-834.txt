URINARY ORGANS. 696 Hence although the two limbs of Henle's loops vary much in size, their bore is almost similar, owing to the different thickness of their epithelial lining. The Renal Blood-vessels: their origin, course, and distribution. The kidney is plentifully supplied with blood by the renal artery, a large offset of the abdominal aorta, which enters the sinus through the hilum, dividing in its passage through the latter into four or five branches. These, whilst in the sinus, give off a few twigs for the nutrition of the surrounding tissues, and terminate in the arterice proprice renales, which enter the kidney proper in the columns of Bertini. Two of these pass to each pyramid of Malpighi and run along its sides for its entire length, giving off' as they advance the afferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies in the columns. Having arrived atjhe bases of the pyramids, they make a bend in their course, so as to lie between the bases of the pyramids and the cortical arches, where they break up into two distinct sets of branches devoted to the" supply of the re- maining portions of the kidney. The first set, the interlobular arteries (figs. 385, 386, b), are given off at right angles from the side of the arteriee proprise renales looking towards the 385.—-Diagrammatical Sketch of 386.—A portion of fig. 385 enlarged.

Interlobular artery and vein, the latter commencing from the stellate veins, and receiving branches from the plexus around the tubuli contorti, the former giving off renal afferents. C.

In their outward course they support the Malpighian bodies by supplying them with afferent vessels, which, having pierced the capsules, end in the Malpi- ghian tufts. From each tuft the corresponding renal efferent arises, which, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent entered, anastomoses with other efferents from other tufts, and contributes to form a dense venous plexus around the urinary tubes adjacent. The second set from the arterise propria; renales are for the supply of the medullary pyramids, which they enter at their bases ; and passing through their substance straight to their apices, terminate in the venous plexuses found in that situation. They are called the arterioles recto (figs. 385, 386, f). The Renal Veins arise from Three sources : the veins beneath the capsule, the

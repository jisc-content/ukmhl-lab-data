655 HEART—RIGHT AURICLE. separated into a right and left, by two longitudinal farrows, the interventricular grooves, which are situated one on the anterior, the other on the posterior surface : these extend from the base to the apex of the organ : the former being situated nearer to the left border of the heart, and the latter to the right. It follows, therefore, that the right ventricle forms the greater portion of the anterior surface of the heart, and the left ventricle more of its posterior surface. Each of these cavities should now be separately examined. The Right Auricle is a little larger than the left, its walls somewhat thinner, measuring about one line ; and its cavity is capable of containing about two ounces. It consists of two parts, a principal cavity, or sinus, and an appendix auriculas. 358.—The Right Auricle and Ventricle laid open, the Anterior Walls of both being removed. Sight Auricula-Ventricular op, The sinus is the large quadrangular cavity, placed between the two venae cavas : its walls are extremely thin : it is connected below with the right ventricle, and internally with the left auricle, being free in the rest of its extent. The appendix aurictdce, so called from its fancied resemblance to a dog's ear, is a small conical muscular porch, the margins of which present a dentated edge. It projects from the sinus forwards and to the left side, overlapping the root of the pulmonary artery. To examine the interior of the auricle, a transverse incision should be made along its ventricular margin, from its right border to the appendix; and from the middle of this, a second incision should be carried upwards, along the inner side of the two vense cavse. The following parts present themselves for examination :— Openings. Superior cava. Inferior cava.. , Coronary Sinus. Valves, s Foramina Thebesii. L Auriculo-ventricular.

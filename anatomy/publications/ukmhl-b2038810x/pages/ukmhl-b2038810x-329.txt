Anterior, or External Crucial. Posterior, or Internal Crucial. Two Semilunar Fibro-cartilages. Transverse. Coronary. Ligamentum mucosum. Ligamenta alaria. The Anterior Ligament, or Ligamentum Patetlw (fig. 139), is that portion of the common tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh which is continued from the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, supplying the place of an anterior ligament. 139.—Right Knee-Joint. Anterior View. 140.—Right Knee-Joint, Posterior View. t is a strong, flat, ligamentous band, about three inches in length, attached, above, 0 the apex of the patella and the rough depression on its posterior surface ; below, 0 the lower part of the tuberosity of the tibia ; its superficial fibres being continuous icross the front of the patella with those of the tendon of the Quadriceps extensor. CWo synovial bursa? are connected with this ligament and the patella; one is inter- red between the patella and the skin covering its anterior surface ; the other of mall size, between the ligamentum patella? and the upper part of the tuberosity f the tibia. The posterior surface of this ligament is separated above from the :nee-joint by a large mass of adipose tissue ; its lateral margins are continuous sith the aponeuroses derived from the Vasti muscles. The Posterior Ligament, Ligamentum Posticum Winsloivii (fig. 140), is a broad, |lat, fibrous band, which covers over the whole of the back part of the joint. It jonsists of a central and two lateral portions, the latter formed chiefly of vertical bres, which arise above from the condyles of the femur, and are connected below nth the back part of the head of the tibia, being closely united with the tendons of

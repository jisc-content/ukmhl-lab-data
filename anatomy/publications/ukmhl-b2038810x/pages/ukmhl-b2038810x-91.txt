THE CAPILLARIES. Ixxxv vessels. As a general rule, the more active the function of an organ is, the closer is its capillary net, and the larger its supply of blood, the network being very narrow in all growing parts, in the glands, and in the mucous membranes; wider in bones and ligaments, which are com- paratively inactive; and nearly altogether absent in tendons and carti- lages, in which very little organic change occurs after their formation. Structure.—The walls of the capillaries consist of a fine, transparent, homogeneous membrane, in which are embedded, at intervals, minute oval corpuscles, probably the remains of the nuclei of the cells from which the vessel was originally formed. In the largest capillaries (which ought perhaps to be described rather as the smallest arteries) traces of an epithelial lining, and of circular transverse fibres, are to be seen. Veins are composed of three coats, internal, middle, and external, as the arteries are; and these coats are, with the necessary modifications, Fig. XXXVI.—Finest vessels on the arte- rial side, i, Smallest artery. 2, Transi- tion vessel. 3, Coarser capillaries. 4, Fig. XXXVII.—An artery, "d"', Finer capillaries. a, Structureless and b, a vein, -oi 5", from the membrane still with some nuclei, repre- mesentery of a child, mag- sentative of the tunica adventitia • b, nified 350 times, and treated nuclei of the muscular fibre-cells; c, with acetic acid.

The main differences between the veins and the arteries is in the comparative weakness of the middle coat of the former; and to this it is due that the

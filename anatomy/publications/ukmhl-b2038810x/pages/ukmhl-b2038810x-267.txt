TIBIA. 129 109.â€”Bones of the Right Leg. Anterior Surface. Styloid jyroee r EXT. LATER* LIO, Ext&Knal Malleolus to compensate for the oblique direction of the femur inwards. It presents for examination a shaft and two extremities. The Upper Extremity, or head, is large and expanded on each side into two lateral eminences, the tuberosities. Superiorly, the tuberosities present two smooth concave surfaces, which articulate with the condyles of the femur; the internal articular surface is longer than the external, and oval from before backwards, to articulate with the internal condyle ; the external one being broader, flatter, and more circular, to articulate with the external condyle. Between the two articular sur- faces, and nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is an eminence, the spinous process of the tibia, surmounted by a prominent tubercle on each side, which gives attachment to the extremities of the semilunar fibro-cartilages; in front and behind the spinous process is a rough depression for the attach- ment of the anterior and pos- terior crucial ligaments and the semilunar cartilages. The an- terior surfaces of the tuberosities are continuous with one another, forming a single large surface, which is somewhat flattened : it is triangular, broad above, and perforated by large vascular foramina, narrow below, where it terminates in a prominent oblong elevation of large size, the tubercle of the tibia ; the lower half of this tubercle is rough, for the attachment of the ligamentum patellse; the upper half is a smooth facet corre- sponding, in the recent state, with a bursa which separates the ligament from the bone. Posteriorly, the tuberosities are separated from each other by a shallow depression, the popliteal notch, which gives attachment to the posterior crucial ligament. The posterior surface of the inner tuberosity presents a deep K

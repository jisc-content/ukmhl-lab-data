THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. LUNGS—No. 2. MEDIASTINAL SURFACE OF THE LEFT LUNG HARDENED IN SITU. This surface shows impressions due to the structures of the mediastinum with which it was in contact. In the front is a hollow, adapted to receive the heart and pericardium, deeper and more extensive in this lung than in the right. Above and behind it is the hilum with the divided bronchus, pulmonary artery and veins, and some lymphatic glands, surrounded by the reflection of the pleura, which is continued downwards as the ligamentum latum pulmonis. Arching over the hilum and passing downwards is a groove for the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta (10, 8 and 5), from which a deep groove passes upwards towards the apex, for the subclavian artery. In front of this again is a groove for the innominate vein, short and wide, and the great fissure is seen intersecting the rounded posterior border. A small area in front of the ligamentum latum, near the lower margin, is in contact with the oesophagus. The figures indicate— 1. Pulmonary artery. 2. Pulmonary veins. 3. Bronchus. 4. Bronchial gland. 5. Groove for descending thoracic aorta. 6. Groove for heart and pericardium. 7. Ligamentum latum pulmonis. thoracic aorta. 9. Commencement of the fissure of the lung. 10. Groove for aortic arch. 11. Subclavian groove. 12. Groove for innominate vein. 8. Deep groove for commencement of descending

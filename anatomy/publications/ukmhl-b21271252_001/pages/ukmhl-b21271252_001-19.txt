The inner surface of this lung shows in front a cardiac depression. Behind it is the hilum, which differs from that of the left side, since the right bronchus gives off, shortly after its com- mencement, an cparterial branch, which enters the lung separately from the main bronchus and at a higher level. It is accompanied by a branch of the right pulmonary artery. Above the. hilum is a curved groove for the vena azygos major, and at a still higher level are two vertical grooves, the anterior for the superior vena cava, the posterior, most distinct near the apex, for the innominate artery. The chief, or oblique, fissure is seen intersecting the lung. The surface for the oesophagus is not very distinct in this specimen. In front of the ligamentum latum, near the lower margin, is a wide groove for the inferior vena cava, passing into the cardiac hollow. 3. Main bronchus, and eparterial branch. 4. Bronchial glands. 5.

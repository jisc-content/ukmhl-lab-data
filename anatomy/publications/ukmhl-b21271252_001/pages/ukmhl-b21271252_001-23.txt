THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. HEART and PERICARDIUM—No. 4. TWO SPECIMENS, VIEWED FROM THE RIGHT SIDE. The specimens have been prepared as described in a previous view (Heart and Pericardium No. 1). The left-hand specimen shows the arrangement of the principal structures in the root of the right lung, and their relation to the superior vena cava, etc. The right bronchus gives off at an early stage, an eparterial branch, which is accompanied by a branch of the pulmonary artery, while the main bronchus passes onwards below the trunk of that artery. The order of structures from above downwards is therefore, eparterial bronchus, right pulmon- ary artery, main bronchus, pulmonary veins. The termination of the vena azygos major is seen passing above the root of the lung. Note also the reflection of .serous pericardium from the inferior vena cava. The right hand specimen is viewed more from in front than the other, and shows the unbroken fibrous pericardial bag, and also the moulding of the aortic arch. The figures indicate— In both Specimens:— In A:— 1. Superior vena cava. 6. Trachea. 2. Ascending aorta. 7. Eight vagus. 3. Eight pulmonary artery, where it gives off its 8.

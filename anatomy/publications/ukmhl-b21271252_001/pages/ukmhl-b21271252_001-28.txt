THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T, C. & E. 0. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. HEART and PERICARDIUM—No. 9. THE INTERIOR OF THE RIGHT AURICLE AND OF BOTH VENTRICLES VIEWED FROM THE FRONT. The anterior portion of the wall of the cone-shaped, or ventricular, part of the heart has been removed, the pulmonary artery and aorta opened up, and the front of the right auricle removed. The right auricular appendix projected in front of the root of the aorta and has left an impres- sion upon it. In the interior of the auricle the openings of the venae cavae, the fossa ovalis and the eustachian valve are (visible, and, in the right ventricle, portions of the marginal and septal cusps. In the left ventricle, the aortic cusp of the mitral valve is prominent. The shape and position of the cusps of the aortic and pulmonary valves is characteristic, one of them being posterior in the pulmonary artery and two anterior, while in the aorta one is anterior and two posterior. Both of the latter are shown, but the anterior has been removed. The figures Indicate— 1. Common pericardial investment of the pulmonary artery and aorta. 2. Above the orifice of the superior vena cava. 3. Above the orifice of the inferior yena cava, points to the fossa ovalis. 4. Septal cusp of the tricuspid valve. 5. Interventricular septum. 6. Semilunar valves of the pulmonary artery. 7. Anterior papillary muscle of the left ventricle. 8. Aortic cusp of the mitral valve. 9. Lies below and to the right of the aortic valve.

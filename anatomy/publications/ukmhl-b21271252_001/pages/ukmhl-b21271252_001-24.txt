THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and U HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. HEART and PERICARDIUM—No. 5. VIEW FROM BELOW. This specimen was prepared by detaching the margin of the pericardium along its whole circumference from the diaphragm and then lifting the entire heart and pericardial bag away. This can easily be done, since the pericardium and diaphragm are only connected by areolar tissue over the greater part of their adjacent surfaces. The diaphragmatic surfaces of both heart and pericardium are applied to the diaphragm, and are nearly flat, and the outline of the heart, seen from this aspect, is triangular,—the apex in front and the base behind. The only orifice in this surface is that for the inferior vena cava, situated at the back and to the right side. The groove to the left side is for the oesophagus. The figures indicate— 1. Right margin of pericardial attachment. 2. Left margin of pericardial attachment. 3. Process of pericardium projecting forwards from the region of the apex of the heart. 4. Inferior vena cava.

THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX—No. 4. THE PLEURAL MEMBRANES SEEN FROM THE FRONT. The anterior thoracic wall has been removed, leaving the parietal pleura in position. The limits of the two membranes are seen, below the first costal arch, to folloAv these lines:— The Right pleura, passing down behind the sternum along an oblique line from right to left, crosses the mesial plane at the lower part, and, slightly overlapping the corresponding membrane of the opposite side, it extends down to a point behind the junction of the body of the sternum with the ensiform cartilage. From this point it passes outwards behind the seventh costal cartilage. The Left pleura, on the other hand, deviates outwards from the middle of the sternum in the fourth interspace, leaving an interval in which the anterior surface of the pericardium is seen, and then passes out across the fifth interspace. The lateral line of reflection is practically the same on the two sides at and beyond the mid- clavicular line, where in this subject the lowest level is at the seventh chondro-sternal junction. It should be noted that this is one space higher than is usually said to be the case, and also that here the area of pericardium uncovered by pleura is smaller than usual, though the usual cause of diminution, emphysema of the lungs, is not present. The figures indicate— 1. Manubrium sterni. 4-9. Corresponding costal arches. 2. Xiphi-sternal junction. 10. Anterior surface of the pericardium. 3. Internal mammary vessels, cut across.

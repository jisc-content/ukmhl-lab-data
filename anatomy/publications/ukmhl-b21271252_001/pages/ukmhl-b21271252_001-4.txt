THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK ; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX—No. 2. DISSECTION OF THE ANTERIOR THORACIC WALL. Skin and fasciae have been removed, and also, on the left side, the costo-sternal portion of the pectoralis major muscle, so as to expose the costal arches and the intercostal spaces. The fat in the suprasternal fossa has been removed, to show the depth of the fossa and its lateral boundaries. The infraclavicular hollow is seen to be due to the interval between the clavicular and costo- sternal parts of the pectoralis major, and the lower border of that muscle corresponds to the fifth costal arch. Below this muscle, on the right side, is a small portion of the aponeurosis of the abdominal muscles, and this has been removed on the left side so as to expose the rectus abdominis at its insertion into the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages. The fibres of the internal inter- costal muscles are seen shining through the anterior intercostal membrane, but only a small portion of the external intercostals can be seen, as they do not extend beyond the junction of the ribs and cartilages. Small anterior intercostal arteries and nerves can be seen emerging through apertures in the intercostal intervals of the left side. The figures indicate— 1-7. Corresponding costal arches. 10. Pectoralis major muscle. 8. Between sternal and clavicular heads of the sternomastoid muscle. 11. Rectus abdominis insertion. 9. Inner end of the clavicle. 12. Aponeurosis of abdominal muscles.

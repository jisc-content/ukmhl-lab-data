The lower end of the great fissure of the left lung is seen at the level of the sixth chondro- sternal junction, dividing the lung into an upper and a lower lobe. The figures indicate— 1-6. Corresponding costal arches. 7. Pericardium covering the right auricle. 8. Area of pericardium not covered by the left lung. 9. Incisura cardiaca. 10. Great fissure of left lung.

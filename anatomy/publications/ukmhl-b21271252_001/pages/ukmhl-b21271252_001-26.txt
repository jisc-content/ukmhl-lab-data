These cusps are placed, one anterior and to the right, and the other posterior and to the left, the anterior lying in front and to the right of the auriculo-ventricular opening. The figures indicate— 1. Depression on the septal wall corresponding to the fossa ovalis 2. Auricular appendix. 3. Great cardiac vein. 4. Left coronary artery. 5. Anterior papillary muscle. 6.

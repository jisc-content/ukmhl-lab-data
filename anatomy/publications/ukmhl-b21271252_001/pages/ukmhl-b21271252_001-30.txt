THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. HEART and PERICARDIUM—No. 11. THE AURICULAR AND VENTRICULAR PARTS OF THE HEART, SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER. The ventricular portion, with the vessels springing from it, and the termination of the trachea, is viewed from behind and the right. The general shape of this part is conical, the auriculo- ventricular apertures open into the base of the cone and the pulmonary artery and aorta rise from it in front of them. The auricular portion has been lifted off, and turned back, and is viewed from below. The auricular portion is crescentic in outline, and the horns of the crescent embrace the origin of the great arteries, while the body of the crescent lies behind them. The natural arrange- ment would be restored by placing the 6 on the auricles on 6 on the ventricles, and 5 on 7. The relative size and position of the two auriculo-ventricular orifices is well seen, the right being much larger than the left. On the Auricular Part :- The figures indicate— On the Ventricular Part : 1. Superior vena cava. 2. Right auricular appendix. 3. Left auricular appendix. 4. Hollow of auricular crescent, which contains the aorta. 5. Cavity of left auricle. 6. Cavity of right auricle. 1. Aortic arch at its termination. 2. Trachea bifurcating. Pulmonary artery. Ascending aorta. Tricuspid orifice. Mitral valve.

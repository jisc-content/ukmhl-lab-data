THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX—No. 6. PLEURAL CAVITY AND LOWER BORDER OF LUNG, VIEWED FROM THE RIGHT SIDE. The coverings of the chest wall have been removed from the lateral aspect, and the lower inter- costal spaces opened up, to show the line of pleural reflection and the lower margin of the lung. The mid-axillary line is shown by a white thread. The line of reflection of the pleural membrane from the chest-wall on to the diaphragm is seen to curve downwards, until, in the mid-axillary line, it crosses the tenth costal arch, and from this level it passes nearly horizontally backwards. The lower margin of the lung lies at a much higher level, an interval of four inches intervening between it and the lowest limit of the pleural cavity in the mid-axillary line. The condition seen here is that of complete expiration, and in that state the lower margin of the lung may be indicated on the surface by a line drawn horizontally round the body about 1J ins. below the nipple, crossing the mid-axillary line at the eighth costal arch. The amount of movement of this margin in respiration is said to be about 1-| ins., and therefore the position of this margin in full inspiration would be about 1J ins. lower down. The figures indicate— 1. Pectoralis major muscle (margin). 4. External oblique muscle (margin). 2. Serratus magnus ,, ,, 5—11. Corresponding costal arches. . 3. Latissimus dorsi „ „ 12. Diaphragm. The line from 3 to 10 indicates the mid-axillary line.

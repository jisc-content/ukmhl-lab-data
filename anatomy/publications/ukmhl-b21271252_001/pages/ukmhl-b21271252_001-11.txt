THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX—No. 9. PERICARDIUM, PHRENIC NERVES, AND THYMUS GLAND, SEEN FROM THE FRONT. TKe lungs have been removed, and the mediastinal pleura stripped from the surface of the pericardium.' The fibrous pericardium is a strong, conical sac, the base attached to the diaphragm, the apex being lost on the great vessels which enter and emerge from the heart. Occupying the middle mediastinum, it is in contact laterally with the mediastinal pleura, phrenic nerves and their accompanying vessels, and it is separated from the anterior chest-wall by the anterior margins of the lungs and pleural sacs, except over a triangular area previously indicated, and by the lower part of the thymus gland. The lower part of the thymus gland, which, in this specimen (adult male), is probably not larger than usual, is seen to extend downwards in front of the pericardium for some distance, in the form of two elongated processes. The pericardium is thrown into wrinkles, on account of the contracted state of the left ventricle. The phrenic nerves can be seen to adapt themselves closely to the outline of the pericardium, and, at a higher level, the right nerve lies on the side of the superior vena cava. The right cupola of the diaphragm is seen to rise to a slightly higher level than the left. The figures indicate— 1. Pericardium. 2-5. Corresponding costal arches. 6. Thymus gland. 7-8. The cupolae of the diaphragm. 9. The right phrenic nerve in apposition with the superior vena cava. 10. Left phrenic nerve lying on the side of the pericardium."

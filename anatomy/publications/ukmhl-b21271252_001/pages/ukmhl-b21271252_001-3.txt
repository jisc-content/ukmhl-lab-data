EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK: and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. THORAX—No. 1. ANTERIOR VIEW OF THE THORACIC WALL, SHOWING THE POSITION OF BONY AND OTHER LANDMARKS IN THE MALE. The outlines of the clavicles and costal arches have been marked as they were to be made out by palpation, and the intercostal spaces are indicated by shading with oblique lines. Two lines have been drawn downwards vertically from the middle of the clavicles, and these lines are continuous with the mid-poupart lines on the abdominal wall. The transverse line extends between the lowest points of the costal arches as seen from the front. Above the manubrium sterni is a distinct hollow, the suprasternal fossa, between the sternal heads of the sterno-mastoid muscles. The subclavicular region is the depressed area, well seen on the right side, below the inner part of the clavicle. The mammary region, indefinite in the male, is limited externally by the anterior fold of the axilla. The nipple in this subject lies over the fourth costal arch, slightly outside the midclavicular line, but it often lies on the fourth space. The junction of the manubrium and body of the sternum is indicated by an angular projection, the angle of Ludovici, and corresponds to the junction of the second costal cartilage with the sternum. The infrasternal fossa between the seventh costal cartilages is well seen. ^ The angle between these cartilages is variable in size, but, on an average, is about 70°. The figures indicate— 1-7. Corresponding costal arches. 11. Suprasternal fossa. 8. The ensiform cartilage. . 12. Midclavicular line. 9. The anjde ofLudovici. 13. Subcostal plane. 10. Inner end of the clavicle.

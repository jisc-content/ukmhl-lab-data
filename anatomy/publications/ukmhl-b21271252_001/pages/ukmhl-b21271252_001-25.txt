THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK ; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. • THORAX. * HEART and PERICARDIUM—No. 6. INTERIOR OF RIGHT AURICLE AND VENTRICLE, SEEN FROM THE RIGHT. The pericardium has been removed from the front of the heart, and the right chambers opened by removing the anterior and lateral walls. The aorta and the superior vena cava, with the margins of their pericardial investment, are seen in the upper part, and the termination of the inferior vena cava in the lower. The sulcus terminalis is seen on the outer wall of the auricle, running from the front of the superior vena cava to the right of the inferior vena cava. In the interior of the auricle are seen the eustachian valve, the annulus ovalis surrounding the fossa ovalis, the aperture of the coronary sinus, and the foramina Thebesii. The tortuous right coronary lies in the auriculo-ventricular sulcus. In the right ventricle the two principal papillary muscles, anterior and posterior, are seen, and the chordae tendinae attaching them to the margins and ventricular aspects of the cusps. Some additional bands attach the valves to the lower part of the infundibulum, the smooth channel leading to the pulmonary artery. The figures indicate— 1. Line of pericardial reflection. 7. Marginal cusp of the tricuspid valve. 2. Appendix of right auricle with musculi pectinati. 8. Anterior papillary muscle. 3. Fossa ovalis surrounded by the annulus ovalis. 9.

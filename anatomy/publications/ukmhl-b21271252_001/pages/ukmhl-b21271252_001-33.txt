THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. MEDIASTINA.—No. 2. THE HEART BED, VIEWED FROM THE LEFT SIDE. The pleural membranes, heart and pericardium, and the left lung have been removed, and the aortic arch and its branches cut across. The mediastinum, occupying the interval between the two pleural membranes, is composed of a number of structures, and is divided into four parts. The pericardium and its contents occupy the middle mediastinum, while the anterior mediastinum lies in front of it, the posterior behind, and the superior above. This view illustrates the immediate relations of the pericardial sac on the right side and behind. The left superior intercostal vein is seen passing to join the left innominate vein, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve of the left side passing upwards between the trachea and the oesophagus. In the posterior mediastinum, the oesophagus is seen to lie at first to the right of the descend- ing thoracic aorta, and then to pass forwards in front of it at the level of the ninth dorsal vertebra.

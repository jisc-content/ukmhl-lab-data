THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX. HEART and PERICARDIUM—No. 12. THREE VIEWS OF SECTIONS THROUGH THE VENTRICULAR PORTION OF THE HEART. A and B are the two halves resulting from a coronal section, passing through the apex, B the front, and A the back part. The principal features shown are:—(1) The left ventricle forms the apical portion of the heart, and its cavity is long and narrow, while the right ventricular cavity is shallow and Avide ; (2) the thick- ness and direction of the interventricular septum, and the occurrence of a thin part, the pars membranacea, at its upper part; (3) the relative size of the auricular ventricular orifices, and the arrangement of the cusps of the valves guarding them ; (4) the aortic cusp of the mitral valve intervenes between the two openings into the left ventricle. B shows the aortic vestibule, a portion of the left ventricle immediately below the aortic orifice, where the wall is smooth, and is fibrous in character and not muscular. G is the inner half of a transverse horizontal section through the ventricles to show the relative thickness of the walls, and the shape and size of the ventricular chambers. The left is circular in outline, while the right is crescentic on account of the bulging of the septum to the right side. The figures indicate— In A. 1. The letterrests on the interventricular septum. 2. Front part of segments of mitral valve. 2. Posterior cusp of mitral valve. 3. Portion of tricuspid valve. 3. Septal cusp of tricuspid. In 0. 4. Rests on the septum,—the left ventricle lies In B. 1. Aortic valve, below which is the vestibule. to the right, the right on the left side.

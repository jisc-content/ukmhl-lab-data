THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAX—No. 3. WALL OF THORAX. The sterno-costal portions of the pectoralis major muscles have been removed, as well as the upper parts of the external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles, and the intercostal spaces opened up by the removal of the intercostal membrane and muscles and the triangularis sterni in each. The inner ends of the fifth and sixth costal cartilages of the left side have also been taken away, to show the relations of the pleural membrane and the internal mammary vessels. The pleural membranes are seen to be bulged forwards in the upper two spaces, and to be in relation to the internal mammary vessels from which they were separated by the triangularis sterni muscle. The membranes of the two sides are seen to be arranged differently, that of the left side sloping outwards from the lower part of the sternum, behind the fifth costal cartilage, while the right pleura passes down to a lower level. In the midclavicular line, however, the two membranes pass down- wards to practically the same level. The internal mammary vessels lie about half an inch external to the side of the sternum, and terminate in the sixth interspace. Two venae comites accompany each artery in the lower part of its course, but unite in the second interspace to form a single trunk. The 1-9. Corresponding costal arches. 14. 10.

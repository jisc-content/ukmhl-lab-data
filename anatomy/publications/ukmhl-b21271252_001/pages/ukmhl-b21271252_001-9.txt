THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C, THORAX—No. 7. LOWER LATERAL LIMIT OF PLEURAL CAVITY AND LUNG, VIEWED FROM THE LEFT. The coverings of the lower part of the side of the chest have been removed, the intercostal spaces opened up, and the parietal pleura removed. The mid-axillary line is indicated by the line from 3 to 3. The pleural cavity is seen to extend, as on the right side, to the tenth costal arch in the mid-axillary LINE, at which level it is four inches lower than the margin of the lung, or two interspaces, practically a hand's breath. There is practically no difference between the lower limits of the pleural cavities of the two sides, and the difference between the lower margins of the lungs is so small as to be practically inappreciable. In the present subject, the limits are fairly typical, except for the fact that the pleura in the nipple line extends to the seventh costal arch, while it more usually extends to the junction of the eighth rib and cartilage at that level. This view and the former one illustrate the amount of space which may be filled by pleural effusions of different kinds. The figures indicate— 1. Pectoralis major muscle (margin). 4-11. Corresponding costal arches. 2. Serratus magnus „ „ 12. Diaphragm. 3. Latissimus dorsi ,, „ 13. External oblique muscle (margin). The line from 3 to 3 is in the position of the mid-axillary line.

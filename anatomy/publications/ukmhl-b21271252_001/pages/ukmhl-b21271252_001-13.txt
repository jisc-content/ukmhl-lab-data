THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH: T. C. & E. C. JACK; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C. THORAXâ€”No. 11. INTERIOR OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HEART, TO SHOW THE VALVES, ETC., IN POSITION. The anterior wall of both the right auricle and ventricle has been removed, leaving only the line of the auriculo-ventricular furrow. The auricle is seen to form the whole of the right margin of the heart, while the ventricle forms a considerable portion of the lower border, and the apex of the heart is formed by the left ventricle. The interventricular septum can be seen, obliquely situated, passing from in front backwards and to the right, and its convex surface projects into the cavity of the right ventricle. The common pericardial investment of the pulmonary artery and aorta can be seen at the upper part, where the serous layer is reflected on to the vessels. The figures Indicate 1-7. Corresponding costal arches. 8. Anterior interventricular furrow with a branch of the left coronary artery. 9. Musculi pectinati of auricle. 10. Right coronary artery in anterior auriculo-ventri- cular furrow. 11. Anterior papillary muscle. 12. Infundibular cusp of tricuspid valve. 13. Pulmonary valve.

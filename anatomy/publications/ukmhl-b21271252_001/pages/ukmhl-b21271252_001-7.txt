THE EDINBURGH STEREOSCOPIC ATLAS OF ANATOMY. EDINBURGH : T. C. & E. C. JACK ; and 34 HENRIETTA STREET, LONDON, W.C THORAX—No. 5. THE LUNGS IN RELATION TO THE CHEST WALL, SEEN FROM THE FRONT. The anterior chest-wall has been removed, and also the parietal pleural membrane lining it, leaving the lines of pleural reflection. The apparent interval between the lungs and the pericardium and diaphragm was occupied by a quantity of sub-pleural fatty tissue, which has been taken away. The anterior borders of the lungs come into apposition with one another behind the lower part of the manubrium sterni, and from that point the margin of the right lung passes vertically clown- wards as far as to the inner end of the seventh costal cartilage. The lower border then passes out- wards to a point in the midclavicular line behind the sixth costal arch. The anterior border of the left lung, on the other hand, deviates slightly outwards, and at the fourth costal cartilage, turns outwards from behind the sternum, and passes to the fifth interspace, where the margin becomes horizontal, and, in the midclavicular line, is at practically the same level as the right lung. The interval between the margins of the lungs and the lines of pleural reflection should be noted. A triangular area of pericardium is seen, uncovered by lung tissue, extending from the middle of the sternum between the fourth cartilage and the seventh, outwards and downwards towards the position of the apex-beat, and this is the area of superficial cardiac dulness. The figures indicate— 1. Manubrium sterni. 4-9. Corresponding costal arches. 2. Xiphi-sternal junction. 10. Pericardium. 3. Reflection of left pleura on to pericardium.

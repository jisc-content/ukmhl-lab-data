90 BONE. Fig. 53. Fig. 53.â€”Portion op a Nodulated Layee op Bone-Tissue from near the surface of the Shaft op a Decalcified Humerus. At one side slireds of fibrous lamellae are seen in the figure. Magnified 300 diameters. Ossified cartilage is found on the articular ends of adult bones, lying underneath the natural cartilage of the joint, both in the move- able articulations and in symphyses, and is in fact the deeper part of the cartilage which has been encroached upon by the calcifying process. border sucli as often bounds a series of Haversian rings. Now, in the decalcified rib, it is easy to peel off the inner from the outer layers, and the detached surface of the former shows a number of oval eminences, some with one, others with two, three, or more lacuna? in their substance ; whilst what was the contiguous surface of the outer layers has exca- vations that correspond. Again, in the grinding tooth of the horse, the surface of the crusta petrosa which is contiguous to the dentine or to the enamel, is marked over with spheroidal bodies having, in decalcified specimens, very much the appearance represented in Fig. 53, but most of them with one or more lacuna-like cavities within. They look very like distinct globules, and were described by Czermak as calcified cells contain- ing lacunae ; but on carefully viewing the decalcified layer in profile-sections and otherwise, I am led to the conclusion that they are mammillary elevations of the surface, continuous by their (sometimes contracted) bases with the general substance. The enamel is destroyed in the decalcification, but the surface of the dentine of the cervix and root from which the mammillated layer of crusta petrosa has been detached, is found to be excavated in a manner to correspond with it ; an arrangement well calculated to secure their mutual connection, [w.s.]

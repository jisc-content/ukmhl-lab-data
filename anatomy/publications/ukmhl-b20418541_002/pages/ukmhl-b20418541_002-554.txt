In the natural state the walls of the ventricles are moistened internally with a serous fluid, which sometimes exists in considerable quantity, even in a healthy brain. It was formerly a subject of dispute whether the lining of the ventricles consisted of epithelium only, or also of a membrane. It is now recognised that a peculiar form of connective tissue is found throughout the substance of the brain, similar to that which has been described in the spinal cord, and like it called neuroglia. A layer of this substance, unmixed with nerve- tissues, but in direct continuity with the interstitial web, and not a distinct mem- brane, supports the epithelium. The form of the epithelial cells appears to vary in different parts : these cells being, according to Kolliker. of the fiat pavement kind in the third ventricle, and more spherical in the lateral ventricles ; and, according to G-erlach, cylin- drical in the aqueductus Sylvii. 'From the central part or body of each lateral ventricle the cavity is extended forwards, backwards, and downwards, thus forming an anterior, a posterior, and a middle or descending cornu (fig. 371).

The tody of each lateral ventricle is roofed by the corpus callosum, and is separated from its fellow by a vertical partition, the septum lucidum (fig. 378, 2), which descends from the corpus callosum to the fornix. In the floor of the ventricle there is seen behind one half

The Eustachian Valve constitutes a crescentic fold of the lining structure of the heart, which is situated to the right of the opening of the inferior vena cava and fossa ovalis, deepens that fossa, and directs the blood entering it from the inferior cava towards the opening of the foramen ovale ; while it throws the opening of the great coronary vein into connection with the right auricle, into which the superior vena cava also opens. The formation at an early period of foetal life of the transverse vein of the neck uniting the left with the right brachio-cephalic veins, carries the whole of the blood returning from the head and neck, toge- ther with that from the main azygos, into the stream entering the heart by the superior cava. The ductus arteriosus passes from the main pulmonary artery into the aorta, at the hollow part of the arch, a short distance beyond the place of origin of the left subclavian artery. It is nearly of the same width with the pulmonary stem, while the right and left pulmonary arteries are of comparatively small size, so long as the lungs have not been expanded by air in respiration. Umbilical Vessels.—Besides the usual branches of the descending aorta intended to supply the abdominal viscera and the lower limbs, two large vessels, named hypogastric or umbilical arteries, are prolonged from the common iliacs, and passing out of the abdomen, proceed along the umbilical cord, coiling round Fig. 597.—Semi-diagrammatic view op the Organs op Circulation in the Fcetus prom before (from Luschka, modified, and from Nature). | a, front of the thyroid cartilage; b, right side of the thyroid body ; c, trachea ; d, surface of the right lung turned outwards from the heart ; e, diaphragm below the apex of the heart; /, right lobe of the liver, dissected to show ramifications of the portal and hepatic veins ; /', the middle part and left lobe of the liver in the same manner, showing branches of the umbilical veins and ductus venosus ; g, right, g', left kidney ; g", supra- renal bodies ; h, right, ti, left ureter; i, portion of the small intestine turned towards the side, to show the veins from it going to the portal vein; Tc, urinary bladder ; I, is placed below the umbilicus, which is turned towards the left of the fostus, and points by a line to the urachus ; m, rectum, divided and tied at its upper part.

THE OVARIAN OVUM. 477 as arising simultaneously, although doubtless the germs may be held to have had previous existence as parts of the germinal epithelium covering the primordial structure of the ovary. By the middle of foetal life, or at the end of the fifth month, the follicle, which is at first only a space for the germ in the ovarian stroma, has received a simple lining of scattered cells, which afterwards in their more developed form constitute the tunica granulosa, and the germinal vesicle is by the same time surrounded by a small quantity of clear protoplasm, or commencing yolk, which separates the vesicle from the granular cells. Still later the zona pellucida appears as a clear mem- branous covering of the yolk protoplasm. By the sixth or seventh month of foetal life an immense number of such small ova closely em- braced by the enclosing Graafian follicles have appeared, so that the ovary appears to be almost entirely occupied by them ; and as they may be counted in prepared specimens of sections, it is easy to estimate their number in the entire ovary. The result of such estimates gives Fig. 338. Fig. 338.—Ova in different stages of progress (Waldeyer). Highly magnified.

The formation of new ova and Graafian follicles probably still continues for some time, but at a much slower rate than during foetal life.

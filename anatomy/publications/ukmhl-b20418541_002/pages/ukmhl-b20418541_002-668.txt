654 THE EAR. the osseous lamina, into the basilar membrane. Near its termination, close to the junction with the basilar membrane, it is perforated with a number of regularly-arranged, elongated apertures (fig. 470, p), which serve for the transmission upwards of the nerve-fibres. The latter, in their course from the spiral ganglion to the auditory epithelium, are lodged, as far as this, in canals in the lower osseous part of the spiral lamina. Their arrangement here will be afterwards more fully described. Fig. 469. Fig. 469.—Vertical Section op the first turn of the Cochlea of a Chill a Year and a Half old. 100 Diameters (Waldeyer).

SIO THE TEETH. This laminated structure is an indication of the deposition of dentinal substance in successive strata in the process of formation of the tooth—the laminae corre- sponding' with the shape of the pulp-surface at successive stages of the process. Not unfrequently lines, varying in number and breadth, are seen in sections of the fully-formed tooth, conforming in direction with the lamination just spoken Fig. 210.

Magnified 7 Diameters. a, the pulp-cavity ; b, dentine ; c, arched incremental lines ; d, cement ; e, enamel with bands indicating the direction of the ranges of fibres ; /, coloured lines of the enamel.

They are caused by imperfect calcification of the dentine, which shows little cavities bounded by, and therefore receiving their figure from, minute nodules or globules of dentine, and hence named interglobular spaces (fig. 211, <■). The lines themselves may be termed " incremental" lines (Salter), as they repre- sent stages of deposition of the dentine. The term " contour lines," which has been applied to them, is inappropriate, inasmuch as they intersect the contour of the tooth. The interglobular spaces, and the globules surrounding them, vary in size within wide limits. A layer, in which they are very fine—granular layer of Purkinje (fig. 208, 2)—is not uncommonly found towards the surface of the fang beneath the cement, and sometimes in the crown beneath the enamel: and it may be noticed that the more superficial of the incremental lines are continued into this layer (see fig. 201).

STRUCTURE OF THE RETINA. G07 hollow, fovea centralis, and, as the retina is thinner here than elsewhere, the pigmentary layer is clearly visible through it, giving rise to an appear- ance as of a hole through the tunic. About T\yth of an inch inside the yellow spot is the round disc, porus opticus, where the optic nerve ex- pands, and in its centre the point from which the vessels of the retina branch. At this place the nervous substance is slightly elevated so as to form an eminence (colliculus nervi optici) (fig. 418, k, k.). MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THE RETINA. When vertical sections of the retina, i.e., sections made perpendicularly to its surface, are submitted to microscopic examination, eight distinct: strata are recognizable, together with certain fibrous structures which pass vertically through the membrane and connect the several layers.

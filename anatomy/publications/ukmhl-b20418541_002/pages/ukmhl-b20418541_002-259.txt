The valve is represented half-closed ; two of the segments are seen foreshortened, the third sideways ; 7, concavity of the aortic arch close to the cord of the ductus arteriosus ; 8, ascending part or sinus of the arch covered at its commencement by the auricular appendix and pulmonary artery ; 9, placed between the innominate and left common carotid arteries ; 10, appendix of the left auricle ; 11, 11, the outside of the left ventricle, the lower figure near the apex. wards and forwards, the latter, the larger, being directed upwards and inwards. Between the two orifices is a slight projection, better marked in certain quadrupeds than in man, which has received the somewhat misleading name of tulercle of Lower (fig. 167, 3). In front of the orifice of the inferior cava, and partly covering it, is a crescentic fold of the lining membrane, the Eustachian valve. This is continuous by its convexity with the margin of the venous orifice, and its anterior cornu is prolonged into the anterior limb of the annulus ovalis. This valve, which is very variable in character in the adult, being

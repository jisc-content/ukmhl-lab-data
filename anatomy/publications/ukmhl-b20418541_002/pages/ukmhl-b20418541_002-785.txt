771 FORMATION OF THE EAR-LABYRINTH. the vesicle exhibits is by the extension of a process upwards and backwards, which remains permanent in the lower vertebrata, but in mammals is obliterated, its vestiges remaining in the aqueduct of the vestibule. The semicircular canals next appear as elongated elevations of the surface of the primary vesicle : the middle portion of each ele- vation becomes separated from the rest of the vesicle by bending in of Fig. 574.—Views op the Cartilage of Meckel and parts connected with the First and Second Branchial Plates.

The cartilage which forms the osseous labyrinth is con- tinuous with that of the rest of the primordial cranium. The car- tilaginous walls of the cavity are united by connective tissue to the vesicle ; this connective tissue, according to Kolliker, becomes divided into three layers, of which the outer forms the lining periosteum, the

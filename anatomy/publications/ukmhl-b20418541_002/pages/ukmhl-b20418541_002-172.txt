NERVOUS TISSUE. 158 so called) not only contains fibres derived from the brain and cord, but also pro- per or intrinsic fibres which take their rise in the ganglia ; and in its com- munications with the spinal and cranial nerves, not only receives from these nerves cerebro-spinal fibres, but imparts to them a share of its own proper gan- glionic fibres, to be incorporated in their branches and distributed peripherally with them. Therefore, according to this latter view, the sympathetic nerve, commonly so called, though not a mere offset of the cerebro-spinal nerves, yet, receiving as it does a share of their fibres, is not wholly independent, and for a like reason the cerebro-spinal nerves (as commonly understood) cannot be con- sidered as constituted independently of the sympathetic ; in short, both the cerebro-spinal and the sympathetic are mixed nerves, that is, the branches of each system consist of two sets of fibres of different and independent origin, one connected centrally with the brain and cord, the other with the ganglia. Hence, if we look to the central connection of their fibres as the essential ground of dis- tinction among nerves, the cerebro-spinal system of nerves might, strictly speak- ing, be considered as consisting of and comprehending all the fibres having their centre in the cerebro-spinal axis, whether these fibres run in the nerves usually denominated cerebral and spinal, or are distributed to the viscera in the branches of the nerve usually named the sympathetic ; and, on the same ground, the sym- pathetic or ganglionic system, strictly and properly so called, would consist of and comprehend all the fibres connected centrally with the ganglia, wherever such fibres exist and into whatever combinations they enter, whether proceeding to the viscera or distributed peripherally with the nerves of the body generally ; the nerve-fibres which emanate from the ganglia on the roots of the spinal and cerebral nerves being reckoned into the system, as well as those from ganglia, usually denominated sympathetic. While ready, however, to acquiesce in the justice of the above distinction, we do not mean to employ the terms already in use in a sense different from that which is currently received. In endeavouring to decide between the two views above stated, it may be first observed that the existence in the sympathetic nerve of fibres connected centrally with the cerebro-spinal axis, is proved not only by tracing bundles of fibres from the roots of the spinal nerves along the communicating branches and into the sympathetic, but by the pain or uneasy sensations which arise from disease or disturbance of organs, such as the intestines, supplied exclusively, or almost exclusively, by what are considered branches of the sympathetic ; by experiments on living or recently killed animals, in which artificial irritation of the roots of the spinal nerves, or of various parts of the cerebro-spinal centre, caused move- ments of the viscera ; and by experiments on the sympathetic nerve in the neck, by which it is shown that the dilatation of the pupil and the tonicity of the cutaneous vessels of the head are dependent on fibres which pass along the sympathetic nerve but are centrally connected with the upper part of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata. These facts, it is evident, accord with both of the above-mentioned opinions respecting the constitution of the sympathetic ; but it may be further shown that this nerve contains fibres which arise from the ganglia and take a peripheral course, so that the second of the two opinions approaches nearer to the truth. In support of this assertion we may adduce the actual observation of nerve-fibres proceeding from the nerve-cells of the ganglia in a peripheral direction only * and there are also other grounds for believing that more fibres pass out of the sympathetic ganglia than can possibly be derived from the brain and cord. This seems to follow from a comparison of the aggregate size of the distributional branches issuing from these ganglia with that of all the branches which can be supposed to enter them. The branches of communication which pass between the ganglia or gangliated cord of the sympathetic and spinal nerves, are connected with the anterior and greater branch of each of the latter nerves, a little in advance of the spinal ganglion ; and at the point of connection the communicating branch in most cases divides into two portions, one central, running towards the roots of the spinal nerve and the spinal cord, the other, peripheral, taking an outward course along with the anterior branch of the spinal nerve with which it becomes incor- porated and distributed. It can scarcely be doubted that the central portion,

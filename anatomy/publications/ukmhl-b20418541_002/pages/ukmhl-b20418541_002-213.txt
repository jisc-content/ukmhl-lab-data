The nerves of the serous membranes are destined chiefly for the blood-vessels, and for the most part accompany these in their course. A few pale fibres, however, are distributed to the substance of the membrane, in which they form a plexus with large meshes : from the branches of this, fibrils may be traced which unite into a somewhat finer plexus near the surface. Fluid.—The internal surface of serous cavities is moistened and lubricated with a transparent and nearly colourless fluid, which in health exists only in a very small quantity. This fluid, which is doubtless derived from the blood-vessels of the membrane, has been commonly represented as similar in constitution to the serum of the blood. But it was long- since remarked by Hewson (and a similar opinion seems to have been held by Haller and Monro), that the fluid obtained

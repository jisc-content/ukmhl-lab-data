THE TEETH. 324 development to be enclosed in the base of the coronoid process of the lower jaw,, and in the maxillary tuberosity in the upper jaw, but they afterwards succes- sively assume their ultimate position as the bone increases in length. The space Fig. 224. Fig. 224.—The Teeth of a Child of Six Years, with the Calcified Parts of the Permanent Teeth exposed (Allen Thomson, after Henle). The whole of the teeth of the right side are shown, together with the three front teeth of the left side : in the upper and lower jaws the teeth are indicated as follows, viz. :— 1, milk-teeth— i, inner or first incisor ; i', outer or second incisor; c, canine ; m, first molar ; m', second molar. 2, permanent teeth—I, inner or first incisor ; F, outer or second incisor ; C, canine ; B, first bicuspid ; B', second bicuspid ; M1, the first molar, Avhich has passed through the gums ; M2, the second molar, which has not yet risen above the gums : the third molar is not yet formed. taken up by the ten anterior permanent teeth very nearly corresponds with that which had been occupied by the ten milk-teeth ; the difference in width between the incisors of the two sets being- compensated for by the smallness of the bicus- pids in comparison with the milk-molars to which they succeed. Lastly, the angle formed by the ramus and body of the lower jaw differs at different ages ; thus it is obtuse in the infant, approaches nearer to a right angle in the adult, and again becomes somewhat obtuse in old age. SECONDARY DENTINE. Under this head are included certain varieties of hard tissue liable to be formed in the pulp-cavity of a tooth after the regular production of the dentine is com- pleted. These, as hitherto noticed and described, are the following * :— 1. Osteodentine (Owen).—This is a hard substance which becomes deposited * Salter, Guy's Hospital Reports ; and Dental Pathology and Surgery.

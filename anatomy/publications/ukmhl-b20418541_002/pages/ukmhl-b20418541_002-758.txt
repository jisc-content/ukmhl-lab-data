DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSCLES. 741 In order also to complete the history of the formation of the limbs, it is necessary to take account of the changes of attitude the anterior and posterior respectively undergo, as compared with the primary em- bryonic position. In this the elbow comes first to be turned outwards and then directed backwards, bringing the flexor surface of the upper arm forwards, while the position of the flexor surface of the fore-arm and hand, though generally and naturally inwards, may, by supination, be brought forwards, and by pronation backwards, the latter being the permanent position given to themanus inmost animals. In the hinder limb, again, the thigh is turned inwards, so that in the higher animals the flexor surface looks backwards, and in all animals the lower division of the limb is turned inwards and the sole of the foot down- wards, so that the extensor surface and dorsum look forwards. (See vol. i., p. 122.) 4. DEVELOPMENT . OP THE MUSCLES. The muscles of the trunk derive their origin from the muscular plates previously referred to as being separated by differentiation of the Fig. 543.

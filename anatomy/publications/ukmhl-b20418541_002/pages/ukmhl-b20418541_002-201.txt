KELATION OF LYMPHATICS TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE. 187 which they more or less completely fill. These cells and cell-spaces form in many parts an intercommunicating network of varying fineness extending throughout the substance of the tissue (fig. 126, d, d), whilst Fig. 126.

Magnified. a, Lymphatic vessel ; b, artery; c, capillaries; d, branched cells of the tissue which are seen to be connected both with the capillary walls, and, as at e, with the lymphatic. in other parts the cells acquire a broad flattened form, and joining edge to edge with other similar cells may in this way form an epithelioid patch in the ground-substance. Not unfrequently the cells in such a patch take on the wavy border described above as met with in the lymphatics of origin (see fig. 124). Further, the flattened cells which form the walls of the latter vessels are connected here and there both with the more isolated cells of the tissue (fig. 126 e) and with those which form the epithelioid patches, and in silvered preparations they appear to be continuous with one another. The epithelioid patches look in fact like a part of the lymphatic, and are commonly regarded as such : it must be understood, however, that the spaces here spoken of, whether containing single cells or groups, are not true vessels, but merely vacui-

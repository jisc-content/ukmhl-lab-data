DEVELOPMENT OF THE EAR. 7G9 Fig. 570. Fig. 570.—Transverse and slightly Oblique Section op the Head of a Fcetal Sheep, in the Region op the Hind Brain (from Foster and Balfour after Boettcher). HB, inner surface of the thickened walls of the hind brain ; RL, recessus vestibuli ; VB, commencing vertical semicircular canal; CC, canalis cochlea?, with the cavity of the primitive otic vesicle. On the left side parts only of these structures are seen ; GrC, cochlear ganglion of the right side ; on the left side, Gr', the ganglion, and N, the auditory nerve connected with the hind brain. the otic vesicle forms at first for a time a follicle open to the surface, and that it has therefore no original connection with the nervous centre. Its position is at the side of the medulla oblongata, and in a place opposite to the interval between the first and second postoral visceral arches. The outer opening of the follicle very soon contracts Fig. 571. Fig. 571.—Labyrinth of the Human Fcetus of four weeks, magnified (from Kolliker). A, from behind ; B, from before ; v, the vestibule ; rv, recessus vestibuli, giving rise later to the aqueduct; cs, commencement of the semicircular canals ; a, upper dilatation, belonging perhaps to another semicircular canal : c, cochlea. and becomes entirely closed. The follicle sinks down towards the basis of the cranium, and becomes imbedded in the formative mesoblastic tissue lying between the basi- occipital and alisphenoid matrices, undergoing chondrification and ossification at a very early period, as has been already described under the development of the head. There are therefore to be distinguished from an early period a part corresponding to the internal membranous labyrinth proceeding from 3 d 2

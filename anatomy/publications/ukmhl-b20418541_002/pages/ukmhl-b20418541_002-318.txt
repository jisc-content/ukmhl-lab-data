304 THE TEETH. Fig. 203. placed. The crown is compressed antero-posterioiTy, and is convex, not only on its outer or labial surface, like the preceding- teeth, but on its inner surface also, which rises vertically from the gum: it is broader than that of an incisor or canine tooth, and is surmounted by two pointed tubercles or cusps, of which the external one is larger and higher than the other. The fang is similarly compressed, and is deeply grooved in all cases, showing a tendency to become double. The apex of the fang is generally bifid, and in the second upper bicuspid the root is often cleft for a considerable distance; but the bicuspid teeth are very variable in this respect, and may be, all four, free from any trace of bifidity of the root. The upper bicuspids are larger than the lower ones, and their cusps are more deeply divided. Sometimes the first lower bicuspid has only one tubercle distinctly marked, i.e., the external, and in that case approaches in figure to a canine tooth. The molar teeth (fig. 205), true or large molars, or grinders, are twelve in number, and are arranged behind the bicuspid teeth, three on Fig. 203.—Canine Tooth of the Upper Jaw. «, front view ; b, lateral view, showing the long fang grooved on the side.

They are distinguished by the large size of the crown, and by the great width of its grinding surface. The first

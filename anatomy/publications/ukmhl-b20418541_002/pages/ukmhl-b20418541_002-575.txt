Fig. 391.â€”Section op Cerebral Convolution (Meynert). 1, Superficial layer of scattered corpuscles ; 2, dense layer of small angular corpuscles ; 3, broader layer of pyramidal corpuscles, separated into columns by the radiating nerve- fibres ; 4, narrow layer of small ir- regular corpuscles ; 5, layer of fusi- form and irregular cells in medullary centre. 4. The fourth layer is nar- rower, and contains many small, irregularly-shaped, often " granule-like," corpuscles, round or angular, with fine processes, placed irregularly and less distinctly separated into groups. 5. The fifth layer, of greater width than the last, is com- posed of fusiform and ir- regular cells. The fusiform corpuscles have a definite ar- rangement, being placed for the most part vertically at the summit of a gyrus, but parallel to the surface of a sulcus, where they correspond in di- rection to the arciform fibres passing from one convolution to another, with which they are said to be connected. Beneath the last layer is the medullary centre, with which it gradually blends. The fibres of the white sub- stance, as they radiate into the grey matter, become finer, in consequence, it is thought, of dividing or branching. The chief deviations from this type are due to varia- tions in the large pyramidal cells, which in places lose their characteristic size and distri- bution. The most conspicuous variation occurs in some parts of the occipital region, especi- ally near the sulcus hippo- o o 2

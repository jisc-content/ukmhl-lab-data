351 MUSCULAR LAYERS OF THE STOMACH. daily the lesser one. On the anterior and posterior surfaces they are very thinly scattered, or scarcely to be found, but towards the pylorus Fig. 216. Fig. 216. â€”Sketch of the Distri- bution of Mus- cular Fibres in the Stomach (Allen Thomson). One-Third the Natural Size. A, external layer of longitudinal fi- bres, as seen from the outside ; B, middle layer of cir- cular fibres as seen on removing the longitudinal layer ; C, oblique fibres ex- posed by removing some of the fibres of the circular layer, the cut edges of which are seen below the lesser curvature ; c, the cardiac end ; p, the pyloric end ; in A, the stronger longi- tudinal fibres passing along the lesser and greater curvatures, and all round the pyloric end, are shown, and the radi- ating fibres spreading from the end of the gullet over the front (and back) of the stomach; in B, the nearly uniform layer of circular fibres, in two sets crossing each other very obliquely at o, and at the car- diac end becoming concentric to the centre of the great cul-de-sac ; in C, the oblique fibres, ob, ob', which form a con- tinuation of the cir- cular fibres of the gullet (ee) and spread from the left side of the cardia, gradually merging into the deeper circular fibres with which, towards cce, they entirely blend. are well marked and form a thick uniform layer, which, passing over

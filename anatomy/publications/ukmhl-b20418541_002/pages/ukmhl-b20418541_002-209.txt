STRUCTURE OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. 105 the veins begin, and tend to the hilus alongside the arteries. The branches which run along the trabecule are in part conducted to the Fig. 131.

The 'blood-vessels of the gland pulp are supported by its pervading retiform tissue, which is not only connected to them, but forms an additional or adventitious coat round their small branches, and even on some of the capillaries (page 178). As to the lymphatics of the gland, it seems to be tolerably well made out, that the afferent vessels, after branching out upon and in the tissue of the capsule, send their branches through it to open into the lymph- sinuses of the cortical alveoli, and that the efferent lymphatics begin by fine branches leading from the lymph-sinuses of the medullary part, and forming at the hilus a dense plexus of tortuous and varicose-looking vessels, from which branches proceed to join the larger efferent trunks. The lymph-sinus, therefore, forms a channel for the passage of the lymph, interposed between the afferent and efferent lymphatics, communi- cating with both, and maintaining the continuity of the lymph-stream. The afferent and efferent vessels, where they open into the lymph-sinus, lay aside all their coats, except the epithelioid lining, which is continued

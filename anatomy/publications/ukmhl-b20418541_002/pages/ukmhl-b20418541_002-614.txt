Externally the choroid is bounded by a membranous layer similar Fig- 409. to the lamina fusca of the sclerotic, and known as the lamina siipra-choroidea (fig. 403, d). It is loosely united to the lamina fusca by vessels and bands of connective tissue enclosing pigment-cells, and the enclosing laminse as well as the uniting structures are coated with epithe- lioid cells, a lymph space being thus formed between the sclerotic and choroid. This space communicates with that of the capsule of Tenon before described (p. 589) (Schwalbe). The inner part of the choroid coat Fie-. 409. — Ramified .Pigment . „ 7 * , . ...

From the ends of the arteries the capillaries radiate, and form meshes which are more deli- cate and smaller than in any other texture, being especially fine at Fig. 410.

With the above results the observations of Peacock, published in the " Monthly Journ. of Med. Science " for 1847, and further observations by the same author in the " Joum. of the Pathol. Soc." in 1860, in the main agree. The elaborate table compiled by Rudolph Wagner, and published in his " Vor- studien zu einer wissensch. Morphol. und Physiol, des Menschl. G-ehirns," 18G0, containing 964 recorded cases in which the weight of the brain had been ascer- tained, may also be referred to as another recent useful contribution to the knowledge of this subject. In illustration of the variation in the average weight of the brain at different ages Table B. is given, deduced from the elaborate researches of Dr. Robert Boyd, in the examination of the brains of 2,086 sane persons of both sexes dying in the St. Marylebone Infirmary, and published in the " Philos. Trans* for 1860. The weights are stated in oz. avoird. and decimal fractions of them. Anatomists have differed considerably in their statements as to the period at which the brain attains its full size, and also as to the effect of old age in diminishing the weight of this organ. Soemmerring held that the brain reached its full size as early as the third year ; the Wenzels and Sir W. Hamilton fixed the period about the seventh, and Tiedemann between the seventh and eighth years. Gall and Spurzheim were of opinion that the brain continued to grow until the fortieth year. The observations of Sims, Tiedemann, and Reid, appear to show that in both sexes the weight of the brain in general increases rapidly up to the seventh year, then more slowly to between sixteen and twenty, and again more slowly to between thirty-one and forty, at which time it reaches its jnaximum point. Beyond that period there appears a slow but progressive dimi-

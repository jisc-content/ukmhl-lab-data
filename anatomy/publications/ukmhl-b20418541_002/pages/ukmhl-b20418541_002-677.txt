Here each nerve fibre most pro- bably has a ganglion-cell interpolated in its course. From the outer side of the ganglion, the fibres, still possessing the dark outline, pass Fig. 477.—Distribution op the Cochlear Nerves in the Lamina Spiralis (after Henle). A, part of the modiolus and spiral lamina, viewed from the base, showing the cochlear nerves forming a network ; 1, filaments of the nerve issuing from the tractus spiralis fora- minulosus ; 2, branches of the nerve entering by the central canal of the modiolus ; 3, wide plexus in the bony lamina spiralis ; 4, close plexus at its border. B, part of the nerves extracted and more highly magnified ; 2, twigs of the nerve from the modiolus close to the lamina spiralis ossea ; gs, spiral ganglion ; fs, nerve-fibres running spirally along the outer part of the ganglion swelling ; 3, wide plexus ; 4, close plexus of nerve- fibres as in A.

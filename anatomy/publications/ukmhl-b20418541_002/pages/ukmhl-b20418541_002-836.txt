822 DEVELOPMENT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. v s, the vesicula semi- In the male, the Miillerian ducts are destined to undergo little development and are of no physiological importance, while the ducts of the Wolffian bodies, and probably also some part of their glandular substance, form the principal part of the excretory apparatus of the testicle. The united portion of the Miillerian ducts remains as the vesicula prostatica, which accordingly not only corresponds with the uterus, as was shown by Weber, but likewise, as pointed out by Leuckart^. contains as much of the vagina as is represented in the male. In some animals the vesicula prostatica is prolonged into comua and tubes ; but in the human subject the whole of the ununited parts of the Miillerian ducts disappear, except- ing, as suggested by Kobelt, their upper extremities, which seem to be the source of the hydatids of Morgagni. The excretory duct of the Wolffian body, from the base of that body to its orifice,,is converted into vas deferens and ejaculatory duct, the vesicula seminalis being formed as a diverticulum from its lower part (Waldeyer). With respect to the formation of the epididymis, it appears certain that the larger convoluted seminal tube, which forms the body and globus minor of the epididymis, arises by a change or adaptation of that part of the Wolffian duct which runs along the outer side of the organ.

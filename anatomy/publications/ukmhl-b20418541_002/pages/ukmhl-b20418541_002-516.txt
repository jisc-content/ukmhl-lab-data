502 ENCEPHALOX. B.—THE EJSTCEPHALGiN'. The encephalon admits of being conveniently divided into the medulla oblongata, the cerebellum with the pons Varolii, and the cerebrum. The medulla oblongata is the part continuous with the spinal cord : it rests on the basilar process of the occipital bone, and on its superior or dorsal surface presents a groove continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. The cerebellum occupies the posterior fossa of the cranium. By the mesial part of its anterior and inferior surface, it forms the roof of a space, the floor of which is the grooved posterior surface of the medulla oblongata, and which is named the fourth ventricle of the brain. On each side of this, the cerebellum is connected with the medulla ob- longata and cerebrum, and also receives the fibres of the pons Varolii, which is a commissure, uniting the two hemispheres of the cerebellum, and passing beneath and between the fibres which extend upwards from the medulla oblongata. The cerebrum includes all the remaining and much the largest part of the encephalon. It is united with the parts below by a compara- tively narrow and constricted portion or isthmus, part of which, forming Fig. 353.

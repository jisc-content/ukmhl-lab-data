538 THE CEREBRUM. Ill front, the corpus callosum is reflected downwards and backwards, between the anterior lobes, forming a bend named the genu (fig. 377, 5). The inferior or reflected portion, which is named the rostrum, becomes gradually narrow as it descends, and is connected by means of the lamina cinerea with the optic commissure. It also gives off the two bands of white substance, already noticed as t\ie peduncles of the corpus callosum, which, diverging from one another, run backwards across the anterior perforated space on each side to the entrance of the Syl- vian fissure. Behind, the corpus callosum terminates in a free thickened border, the under surface of which is also free for a short distance. The under surface of the corpus callosum is connected behind with the fornix, a structure to be presently described, and in the rest of its Fig. 377. Fig. 377.—View of the Corpus Callosum from above (from Sappey after Foville). £ The upper surface of the corpus callosum has been fully exposed by separating the cerebral hemispheres and throwing them to the side ; the gyrus fornicatus has been detached, and the transverse fibres of the corpus callosum traced for some distance into the cerebral medullary substance. 1, the upper surface of the corpus callosum ; 2, median furrow or raphe ; 3, longi- tudinal striae bounding the furrow ; 4, swelling formed by the transverse bands as they pass into the cerebrum ; 5, anterior extremity or knee of the corpus callosum ; 6, pos- terior extremity ; 7, anterior, and 8, posterior part of the mass of fibres proceeding from the corpus callosum ; 9, margin of the swelling ; 10, anterior part of the convolution of the corpus callosum ; 11, fissure between the corpus callosum and its convolution opened out ; outside 12, is the termination of the calloso-marginal fissure, and behind 14 is the parietooccipital fissure, and between the two the quadrate lobule ; 13, upper surface of the cerebellum.

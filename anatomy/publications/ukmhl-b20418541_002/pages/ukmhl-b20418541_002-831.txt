FARTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVARY. 817 The further steps in the formation of the ovum, as ascertained by the observa- tions of Foulis, consist mainly in the enlargement of the mass of yolk proto- plasm, the formation of a certain quantity of albuminous and fatty granules in combination with it (deutoplasm of Edw. van Beneden) ; and the formation ex- ternally of the zona pellucida or yolk-membrane by a consolidation of the outer Fig 611.

A, small portion of the ovary of a human foetus of 3 3 months, showing primordial ova imbedded in the stroma ; 0, larger primordial ova ; 0 cl aster of earlier ova ; n, fusi- form corpuscles of the stroma. B, portion of the ovary near the surface in a human foetus of 74 months, showing the manner of inclusion of the germ epithelium corpuscles in groups in the ovarian stroma ; e, germ epithelium ; e', one of the cells enlarging into a primordial ovum before sinking into the stroma ; 0, a larger cell imbedded, becoming an ovum ; 0', groups of ovigerms or germ cells which have been surrounded by the stroma. C, young ovum from the same ovary, isolated ; p, yolk protoplasm. D, ovum more advanced, enclosed in condensed stroma, which begins to form a Graafian follicle ; p, yolk proto- plasm ; v, germinal vesicle with macula ; g, the fusiform corpuscles now converted into the granular cells ; Gf, condensed stroma forming the wall of the Graafian follicle. layer of the yolk substance. And here it may be remarked that the recent observations of Oellacher and Balfour on the radiated structure of the yolk proto- plasm may explain in some degree, or be connected with the linear radiated marking of the zona pellucida. Such is the number of ova formed in the manner now described, that in the human fetus of six to seven months the whole substance appears to consist of them and their newly formed Graafian follicles, by which 3 g 2

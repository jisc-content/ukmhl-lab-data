The section passes through the place where the alimentary canal (Jiy) com- municates with the yolk-sac. vertebral division of which it was originally connected. In the inner or central part of the primordial vertebrae a different kind of change occurs, first, by the amalgamation or fusion of the protovertebral masses, and subsequently by their subdivision in such a manner that the intervertebral disc arises on a level with or opposite the centre of each protovertebral mass, and the blastema, out of which a permanent verte- bral body is formed, is made up by the union of two parts, an anterior and a posterior, the first of these being derived from the hinder part of the preceding protovertebral mass of the same number, the other part being supplied by the anterior section of the protovertebral mass immediately following. This is a somewhat complicated change ; and the more difficult to be followed that it would appear that the original division between the protovertebral masses disappears previous to a new segmentation taking place. Thus it results that, as respects the centrum or body part, the posterior half of one protovertebra is

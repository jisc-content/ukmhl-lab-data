NERVOUS TISSUE. 138 from the insertion of the first, and makes several turns on the surface of the cell, but within its capsule, which are continued as spiral coils round the straight fibre, and then the two part company, and appa- rently run in opposite directions in the nervous bundle in which they mingle. The spiral fibre bears large oblong nuclei along its course. These are seen on its spiral turns upon the surface of the cell, and some, at the commencement of the fibre, seem to be beneath the surface. It may be single from the first, or begin by two or more filaments which join at some distance from the cell. Both fibres increase in size as Fig. 94.

They have at first the character of pale fibres (or axis- cylinders), then one of them—generally the straight one, but it may be the other—at a short distance from the cell acquires a medullary sheath and becomes a dark bordered fibre. At the same time it cannot be positively said that both fibres may not become dark bordered, or both continue as pale fibres. The spiral fibres may make more or fewer

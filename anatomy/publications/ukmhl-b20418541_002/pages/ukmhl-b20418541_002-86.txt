74 CARTILAGE. mostly directed vertically. (Fig. 43.) It is well known that articular cartilages readily break in a direction perpendicular to their surface, Fig. 43. Fig. 44.

Magnified 400 diameters. and the surface of the fracture appears to the naked eye to be striated in the same direction, as if they had a columnar structure; this has been ascribed to the vertical Fig. 45. a 7) h km n r arrangement of the rows of cells, or to a latent fibrous or col- umnar disposition of the substance of the matrix (Leidy). It was formerly held that the free surface of articular cartilage is covered with epithelium, but no such covering really exists. It is easy, no doubt, to peel off a thin film from the surface of the cartilage of the head of the humerus or femur ; but this superficial layer is really part of the cartilage, and its broad patches of cells with the intermediate matrix are not to be Fig. 45.—Border of Articular Cartilage showing Transition of Cartilage Cells into Connective- Tissue Corpuscles of Synovial Membrane.

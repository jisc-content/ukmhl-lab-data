133 NERVE-CELLS. those from the grey matter of the spinal cord and brain, are of an angular or irregular figure, and send out processes, often finely branched, from their circumference (figs. 87, 88, and 90); and then they are often Fig. 88. Fig. 88.â€”Two Nerve-Cells from Anterior Column of Spinal Cord of Ox, isolated after Maceration in very Dilute Chromic Acid. Magnified 175 Diameters. Each cell has a well-defined, clear, round nucleus, and a bright nucleolus. The cell processes are seen to be finely fibrillated, the fibrils passing from one process into another through the body of the cell. named, according to the number of processes they present, uni-, bi-, and multi-polar ; terms obviously ill chosen, but rendered current by use. They have each, as a rule, a large, well-defined, clear, round

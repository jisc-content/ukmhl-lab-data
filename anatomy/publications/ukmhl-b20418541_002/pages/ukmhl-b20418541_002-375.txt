STRUCTURE OF THE VILLI. Fig. 255. — Mag- nified View op the Blood-ves- sels op the In- testinal Villi. The drawing twas taken from a pre- paration injected by Lieberkiikn, and shows in each villus a small artery and vein with the inter- mediate capillary network. EUr. 255. Fig. 256. — Injected Lacteal Vessels in the Villi op the Human Intestine. A, two villi in which the lacteals are represented as filled with white substance and the blood-vessels with dark : 100 diameters (Teich- mann). a, b, the lacteal vessels, single in one villus and double in the other ; c, the horizontal lacteal ves- sels with which those of the villi communicate ; d, the blood-vessels, consisting of small arteries and veins with capillary network between. B, injected lacteal (shaded dark) in a villus, showing an example not very common of a looped net- work a, which is connected by a single vessel with the horizontal lacteal vessel b : the preparation was made froni the intestine of a young man who died suddenly while digestion was going on : 80 diameters (from W. Krause). Fig. 257. — Vertical Section op the Intestinal Mucous Mem- brane op the Rabbit (slightly altered from Frey). ~. Two villi are represented, in one of which the dilated lacteal alone is shown, in the other the blood- vessels and lacteal are both seen injected, the lacteal white, the blood-vessels dark : the section is carried through the tubular glands into the submucous tissue : a, the lacteal vessels of the villi; a', hori- zontal lacteal, which they join ; b, capillary blood-vessels in one of the villi; c, small artery ; d, vein ; e, the epithelium covering the villi; g, tubular glands or crypts of Lieberkiihn, some divided in the middle, others cut irregularly ; i, the submucous layer. A, cross section of three tubular glands more highly magnified. 25G. Fig. 257.

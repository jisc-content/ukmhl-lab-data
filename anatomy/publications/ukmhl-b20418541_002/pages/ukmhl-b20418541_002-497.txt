483 THE PERITONEUM. denum; behind the orifice is the vena cava; it is bounded above by the Fig. 340, A.â€”Diagrammatic Outline of a SUPPOSED SECTION OF THE BODY, SHOWING THE INFLECTIONS OF THE PERITONEUM IN the Female (Allen Thomson), i The upper part of the section is a little to the right of the mesial plane of the body, through the quadrate and Spigelian lobes of the liver; below, it is supposed to be mesial: I c, placed above the diaphragm opposite to the coronary ligament of the liver ; I, the liver ; V, lobe of Spiegel ; s, stomach ; c, transverse colon ; i, the small intestine ; p a, pancreas ; a, the aorta ; d, the duode- num ; v, urinary bladder ; u, uterus ; r, rectum ; ?*', its middle part opened ; v a, vagina; p, p, the parietal peritoneum lining the front and back of the abdominal cavity ; the line representing the inflections of the greater sac of the peritoneum will be traced from the neighbourhood of I c, where it passes on the upper surface of the liver over the upper and lower surfaces of that organ, in the front of gh, the gastro-hepatic omen- tum, over the front of the stomach, down to o', the outer layer of the great omentum, whence it passes back to the vicinity of the pancreas, and re-descends as the upper layer of the transverse meso-colon ; after enclosing the colon it returns on the lower surface of the transverse meso-colon, m c, to the root of the mesentery, m ; it now forms the mesentery and encloses the small in- testine, returning to the posterior wall of the abdomen, whence it passes over the rectum, r, descends into the recto-vaginal pouch, u', covers the back and front of the uterus and the bladder partially, and regains the anterior abdominal wall above the pubes. As connected with the lesser sac of the peritoneum, w marks the posi- tion of the foramen of Winslow as if seen beyond the section ; the lesser sac, with the cavity of the omentum, is shaded with horizontal lines, and is marked o o : round this space the line of the peri- toneum may be traced from the diaphragm over the lobe of Spiegel, to the back of the gastro-hepatic omentum, thence behind the stomach and down into the great omen- tum ; it then ascends to the pancreas, which it covers, and thence reaches again the diaphragm. B is a sketch of part of a section similar to that of A, but showing the view more commonly taken, according to which the two layers of the meso-colon are continuous with the posterior pair of the layers of the great omentum. Spigelian lobe where joined by the lobulus caudatus ; its lower boundary is formed by the duo- Fig. 340.

217 STRUCTURE OF THE NAILS. tactile and a vascular papilla may spring from the same stem. The Fig. 144. Fig. 144.—Section of Skin showing two Papilla and deeper Layers op Epidermis. (Biesiadecki.) a, Vascular papilla with capillary loop passing from subjacent vessel c ; b, nerve papilla with, tactile corpuscle, t. The latter exhibits transverse fibrous markings : three nerve- fibres, d, are represented as passing up to it : at // these are seen in optical section. structure of these different terminal corpuscles has been already described (pages 147 to 153). Chemical composition.—The corium being" composed chiefly of white fibrous tissue, has a corresponding chemical composition. It is, accordingly, in a great measure, resolved into gelatin by boiling, and hence, also, its conversion into leather by the tanning process. Development of the cutis.—The cutis consists at first of cells which may be traced back to the first formative cells of the embryo. Many of them give rise to connective tissue ; others to vessels and nerves; and a third portion is con- verted into fat-cells. The mode of formation of these several elementary tissues has been already described. Progressive development takes place from within outwards, so that the papillae are formed latest. NAILS AND HAIBS. The nails and hairs are growths of the epidermis, agreeing essentially in nature with that membrane; their epidermic tissue is destitute of vessels and nerves, and separable from the cutis. Nails.—The posterior part of the nail which is concealed in a groove of the skin is named its " root," the uncovered part is the " body," which terminates in front by the " free edge." A small portion of the nail near the root, named from its shape the lunula, is whiter than the rest. This appearance is due partly to some degree of opacity of the substance of the nail at this point, and partly to the skin beneath being less vas- cular than in front.

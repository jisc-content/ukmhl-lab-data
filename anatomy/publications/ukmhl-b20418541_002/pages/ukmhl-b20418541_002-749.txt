735 THE PITUITARY BODY. associated in a remarkable manner the origin of a body (the pituitary gland or hypophysis cerebri) the nature and uses of which in the adult are entirely Fig. 535. Pig. 535.â€”Vertical Section op the Head in Early Embryoes op the Rabbit, Magnified (from Mihalkovics). ' A. From an embryo of five millimetres long. B. From an embryo of six millimetres long, C. Vertical section of the anterior end of the notochord and pituitary body, &c., from an embryo sixteen millimetres long. In A, the faucial opening is still closed ; in B, it is formed ; c. anterior cerebral vesicle ; mc, meso-cerebrum ; mo, medulla oblongata ; co, corneous layer ; m, medullary layer; if, infundibulum ; am, amnion ; spe, spbeno-ethmoidal, be, central (dorsum sellte), and spo, spheno-occipital parts of the basis cranii ; h, heart ; /, anterior extremity of primitive alimentary canal and opening (later) of the fauces ; i, cephalic portion of primitive intestine ; tha, thalamus ; p', closed opening of the involuted part of the pituitary body (py) ; ch, notochord ; ph, pharynx. unknown, but the constancy of whose presence, and the uniformity of its connections in the whole series of vertebrate animals, points to some important morphological relation. The general nature of this body, in its joint connection with the infundibulum of the brain on the one hand, and a diverticulum of the alimentary canal on the other, was first pointed out by Rathke (Miiller's Archiv, 1838, p. 482), although he afterwards abandoned the view there set forth. It was, however, fully confirmed by others ; and, among recent observers, we owe more especially to William Miiller an VOL. II. 3 B

BONE. 102 the granular osteoblastic cells which succeed them. On the other hand, Loven* has suggested, and, as it would seem, with more probability, that the osteoblastic corpuscles properly belong- to the vascular processes of the subperiosteal tissue, Fig. 61, A. fig. 61. a and b represent two transverse sections of growing bone, as in Fig. 58, but much more magnified (about 120 diameters). They show the lateral coalescence of the primary bony areolae and the thickening of the sides of the enlarged cavities by new osseous deposit. The section A is made almost im- mediately below the surface of ossification ; B, is somewhat lower, and shows the cavities still more enlarged and their sides more thickened than in A. The new osseous lining is transparent, and appears light in the figures ; the dark ground within the areolae is owing to opaque debris, which collected there in grinding the sections. It must be further noticed that the letter A within the larger figure, marks a place where a bony partition had been accidentally broken away, for the large space was naturally divided into two. which, as already stated, penetrate the newly formed bone and spread throughout its cavernulated structure. The excavation and removal of the cartilage, as well as the partial absorption of the walls of the bony cavities, is no doubt effected by this tissue, and the abundant osteoblastic cells which appear in it are most Studier och Undersokningar ofver Benvafnaden.

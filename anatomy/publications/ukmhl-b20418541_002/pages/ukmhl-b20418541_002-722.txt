708 THE FQSTAL MEMBRANES. is reduced to its simplest form, and consists in little more than the implantation of comparatively simple and diffused chorionic villi in minute recesses of the vascular lining membrane of the uterus ; in others there is a greater or less degree of deeper interpenetration of Fig. 516.—Surface and Profile Views of the Ovum of the Rabbit at the time of the formation of the Chorion (Kolliker after Bisclioff). A and B, an ovum of 3 lines in diameter ; C, one of 4 lines, a, the chorion, with commencing villi ; b, the vesicular ' blastoderm ; c, the thickened part forming the embryonic area; d, the increasing extent in which the blastoderm was found to consist of two layers. the more highly developed and complex villi with a vascular structure formed from the uterine lining membrane, and which, from its being in whole or in part separated along with the ovum from the uterus in certain animals at the period of birth, has received the name of decidaa. Origin of the Chorion.—The manner in which the permanent chorion is first formed has not yet been fully ascertained. The deposit of an albuminous layer on the external surface of the zona pellucida of the rabbit, which takes place in the course of the descent of the ovum through the Fallopian tube, naturally led to the supposition that the chorion might be derived from some external deposit or uterine secretion of this nature ; but the fact that a similar deposit from without has not been observed to occur in other animals, and that the albuminous coat in the rabbit very soon thins away like the zona itself, and gives place to other structures, has caused this view to be abandoned. Nor is it probable that the chorion proceeds mainly, as held by some, from a development of the vitelline membrane. For when the rapid expansion of the ovum occurs shortly after its arrival in the cavity of the uterus, the zona pellucida becomes proportionally dilated, and is reduced to an extreme degree of thinness, so that at this period it is liable to be

THE RECTUM. 377 rectum, extends from the sigmoid flexure of the colon to the anus, and is situated entirely within the true pelvis, in its back part (fig. 272, r,r). Commencing opposite the left sacro-iliac articulation, it is directed at first obliquely downwards, and from left to right, to gain the middle line of the sacrum. It then changes its direction, and curves forwards in front of the lower part of the sacrum and the coccyx, and behind the bladder, ve'sicnlas seminales and prostate in the male, and at the back of the cervix uteri and vagina in the female. Opposite the Fig. 272. Fig. 272.â€”Vektical Section of the Pelvis and its Visceka in the Male (from Houston), A This figure is introduced to illustrate the form, position, and relations of the rectum ; it also shows the bladder and urethra with the pelvic inflection of the peritoneum over these viscera : r, r, r, the upper and middle parts of the rectum, and at the middle letter the fold separating the two ; r, a, the lower or anal portion ; v, the upper part of the urinary bladder ; v', the base, at the place where it rests more immediately on the rectum ; p, the prostate gland and prostatic portion of the urethra ; h, the bulb ; c, c, the corpus cavernosum penis and suspensory ligament ; sc, the scrotum ; s, symphysis pubis. prostate it makes another turn, and inclines downwards and backwards to reach the anus. The intestinum rectum, therefore, so called from its original description being derived from animals, is far from being straight in the human subject. Seen from the front, the upper part of the rectum presents a lateral inclination from the left to the median line of the pelvis, sometimes passing beyond the middle to the right; and wdien viewed from the side (fig. 272), it offers two curves, one corresponding with the hollow front of the sacrum and coccyx, and

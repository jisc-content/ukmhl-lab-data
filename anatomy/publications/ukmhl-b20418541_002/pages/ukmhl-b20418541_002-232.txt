THE SKIN. 218 Fig. 145. The part of the corium to which the nail is attached, and by which in fact it is secreted or generated, is named the matrix. This portion of the skin is highly vascular and thickly covered with large vascular papillae. Posteriorly the matrix forms a crescentic groove or fold, deep in the middle but getting shallower at the sides, which lodges the root of the nail; the rest of the matrix, before the groove, is usually named the bed of the nail. The small lighter coloured part of the matrix next the groove and corresponding with the lunula of the nail, is covered with papillae having do regular arrangement, but the whole remaining surface of the matrix situated in front of this, and supporting the body of the nail, is marked with longitudinal and very slightly diverging ridges cleft at their summits into rows of papillae. These ridges, or IcmvincB, as they are sometimes, and perhaps more suitably, named, fit into corresponding furrows on the under surface of the nail. The cuticle, advancing from the back of the finger, becomes attached to the upper surface of the nail near its posterior edge, that is, all round the margin of the groove in which the nail is lodged ; in front the cuticle of the point of the finger becomes continuous with the under surface of the nail a little way behind its free edge. The nail, like the cuticle, is made up of epithelial cells. The oldest and most superficial of these are the broadest and hardest, but at the same time very thin and irregular, and so inti- mately and confusedly con- nected together that their respective limits are scarcely discernible. They form the exterior, horny part of the nail, and cohere together in irregular layers, so as to give this part a lamellar structure. On the other hand, the youngest cells, which are those situated at the root and under sur- face, are softer and of a rounded or polygonal shape. The deepest layer differs somewhat from the others, in having its cells elon- gated, and arranged per- pendicularly, as in the case of the epidermis. Thus the under part of the nail (fig. 145, B) corresponds in nature with the Malpi- ghian or mucous layer of the epidermis, and the upper part (c) with the horny layer. As in the case of the epidermis, the hardened scales may be made to reassume their cellular character by treatment with caustic alkali, and after- a.

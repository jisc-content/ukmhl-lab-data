OSSIFICATION IN CARTILAGE. 99 to the newl)r-formed bone (c), which from its dark opaque aspect con- trasts strongly with the cartilage, and tracing it towards their mutual boundary, we see plainly the dark lines of ossification shooting up into the clear spaces of the cartilage between the groups of corpuscles. The earthy deposit, in fact, proceeds through the matrix, and affects also those parts of the cartilage-capsules which form the circumference of a group, so that the new osseous substance forms in the first instance Fig. 57. Fig. 57.—Thin Longitudinal Section of Ossifying Cartilage from the Humerus of a Foetal Sheep. a, cartilage-cells uniformly diffused ; b, cells nearer the boundary of the ossification, collected into piles and inclosed in oblong areolae of the clear matrix ; c, dark lines of ossification extending into the matrix and forming the primary bony areolee. Magnified about 70 diameters. Fig. 58.—Transverse Section of the Ossifying Cartilage represented in Fig. 57. Made a little above c, along the surface of ossification, and including part of the new- bone, magnified 70 diameters. The circular sections of the groups of cells and of the osseous areolse are seen ; and the dark bone extending into the clear intercellular matrix. oblong areolse or loculi, which enclose the groups of cells. This is further illustrated by a thin transverse section, carried nearly parallel to the ossifying surface, and partly encroaching on it, so as to take off a little of the bone along with the cartilage, as represented in fig. 58.

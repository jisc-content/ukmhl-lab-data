THE SALIVARY GLANDS. 336 and fascia, and partially by the platysma muscle. It is bounded above by the zygoma, below by a line drawn backwards from the lower border of the jaw to the sterno-mastoid muscle, and behind by the external meatus of the ear, the mastoid process, and sterno-mastoid muscle. Its Fig. 236. Fig. 236.—Sketch of a Superficial Dissection of the Face, showing the Position of the Parotid and Submaxillary Glands (Allen Thomson). Two-Fifths the Natural Size. p, the main part of the parotid gland; p', the small part, which lies alongside the duct, on the masseter muscle ; d, the duct of Stenson before it perforates the buccinator muscle ; ■a, transverse facial artery ; n, n, branches of the facial nerve emerging from below the gland ; /, the facial artery passing out of a groove in the submaxillary gland and ascend- ing on the face ; s m, superficial larger portion of the submaxillary gland lying over the posterior part of the mylo-hyoid muscle. anterior border, which lies over the ramus of the lower jaw, is less distinctly defined, and stretches forwards to a variable extent on the masseter muscle. It is from this anterior border of the gland that the excretory duct passes off'; and there is frequently found in connection with the duct, and lying upon the masseter muscle, a small process or a separated portion of the gland Q/), which is called glancluM soda parotidis. On trying to raise the deeper part of the parotid gland from its position, it is found to extend far inwards, between the mastoid process and the ramus of the jaw, towards the base of the skull, and to be intimately connected with several deep-seated parts. Thus, above, it reaches into and occupies the posterior part of the glenoid cavity; behind and below, it touches the digastric muscle, and rests

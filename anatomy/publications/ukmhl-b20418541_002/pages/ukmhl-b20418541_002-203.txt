LYMPHATIC ORIFICES. 189 recently satisfactory evidence of openings in the lymphatics on the sur- face of the serous membranes has been obtained. Recklinghausen stretched the tendinous centre of the diaphragm, excised from a rabbit, over a ring of cork, covered it with a film of milk, and then, watching it with the microscope, saw the milk-globules at various points drawn down as if in a vortex, and disappearing. He then found they had passed into the lymphatics of the peritoneal covering of the diaphragm, by small openings, not more than twice the diameter of a blood-corpuscle, over which the epithelioid layer of the peritoneum was similarly perforated. Observations in confirmation of these were made in the Physiological Institute of Leipsic, under the direction of Professor Ludwig, by Dybkowski, who found apertures (answer- ing very nearly to those described by von Recklinghausen) on the dog's pleura, by which the superficial lymphatics open on the surface of the membrane ; he also found that fine particles of colouring matter could, under certain conditions, be made to pass from the cavity of the pleura into the lymphatics, and apparently by the open- ings in question. Similar communications were found by Schweigger- Seidel and Dogiel between the frog's peritoneum and the great lymph- sac (cisterna magna) behind it. These apertures, or stomata, have been more recently investi- gated by Klein,* who has further found them in the omentum of mammals. They are surrounded by a ring of small granular * The Lymphatic System, Part I. : The Anatomy of Serous Membranes. London, 1873.

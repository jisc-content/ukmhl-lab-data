The Cerefero-spinal Centre.—From what has been previously- stated it will have been seen, that the rudiment of the cerebro-spinal Fig. 544. Fig. 545. Fig. 544.—Embryo of the Dog seen from above, with a portion of the Blastoderm attached (from Bisckoff). The medullary canal, not yet closed, shows at the cephalic extremity a partial division into the three primary cerebral vesicles ; and at the posterior extremity a rhomboidal enlargement. Six proto-vertebral divisions are visible ; so, the upper division of the blastoderm, sp, the lower division.

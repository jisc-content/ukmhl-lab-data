The inner surface of the retina is smooth : on it the following objects may be seen (fig. 417). In the axis of the ball is a yellow spot—macula lutea (Umdus luteus, Sommerring)—which is somewhat elliptical in shape, and about o^th of an inch in diameter: in the centre of this, again, is a slight Fig. 418.

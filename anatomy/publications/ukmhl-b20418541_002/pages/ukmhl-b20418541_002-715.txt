Fig. 512. but in the higher animals, as the greater part of the epiblast and somatopleure layer of the mesoblast comes to be detached from the surface of the yolk by the expansion of the amnion and allantois, the hypoblast and splanchnopleure layer of the mesoblast are alone the permanent constituents of the wall of the yolk-sac ; and through these last the membrane of the yolk-sac is continuous with the wall of the intestine in the yitello-intestinal aperture.

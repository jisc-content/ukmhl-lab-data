547 INTERNAL PARTS. of transverse white fibres, a continuation of a series of transverse fibres which underlie the corpora quadrigemina. Its fibres, passing through the thalami, diverge in the white substance of the hemisphere. _ The corpora striata {anterior cerebral ganglia), situated in front and to the outer side of the optic thalami, are two large ovoid masses of grey matter, the greater part of each of which is embedded in the Fig. 383. Fig. 383.—Dissection of the Brain prom above, exposing the Lateral,—Third, and Fourth Ventricles, with the surrounding parts (from Hirschfeld and Leveille). J a, the anterior part or knee of the corpus callosnm divided ; its fibres are seen spreading on each side into the cerebral hemispheres ; b, anterior part of the surface of the right corpus striatum, in the anterior cornu of the lateral ventricle ; b', the same on the left side, in which the grey substance has been dissected so as to show the peduncular medul- lary fibres spreading through the corpus striatum into the cerebral hemisphere ; c, points by a line to the tamia semicircularis ; d, surface of the thalamus opticus ; e, the anterior pillars of the fornix divided ; below, they are seen descending in front of the third ventricle, and between them is seen a part of the anterior commissure ; above the letter is seen the fifth ventricle represented as a slit between the two laminae of the septum lucidum ; /, placed on the soft or middle commissure ; g, in the posterior part of the third ventricle ; on either side of this letter is the white stria or peduncle of the pineal gland ; immediately below the letter is the small posterior commissure and the pineal gland ; h, the upper, and i, the lower of the corpora quadrigemina ; Tc, superior peduncle of cere- bellum ; and close to this the valve of Vieussens, which is partly divided by a median incision along with the middle lobe of the cerebellum, so as to open up the fourth ven- tricle ; I, the hippocampus major and corpus fimbriatum separated from the posterior pillar of the fornix and descending into the middle cornu of the lateral ventricle ; m, posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle and hippocampus minor ; n, eminentia collateral is ; the cavity of the fourth ventricle ; p, posterior surface of the medulla oblongata ; r, section of the middle lobe showing the arbor vitse ; s, upper surface of the cerebellum brought into view on the left side by the removal of the posterior extremity of the left hemisphere.

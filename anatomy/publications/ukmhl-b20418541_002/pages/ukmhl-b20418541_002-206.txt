192 LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. The lymphatics or lacteals which enter a gland are named inferent or afferent vessels (vasa inferentia seu afferentia), and those which issue from it efferent vessels (vasa efferenUa). The afferent vessels (fig. 128, Fig. 128. Fig. 128.â€”Diagrammatic Section of Lymphatic Gland. a, I, afferent ; e, I, efferent lymphatics. C, cortical substance. M, reticulating cords of medullary substance. I, s, lymph-sinus ; c, fibrous coat sending trabecular, tr, into the substance of the gland. a, I), on approaching a gland, divide into many small branches, which enter the gland; the efferent vessels commonly leave the gland in form of small branches, and at a little distance beyond it, or sometimes even before issuing from it, unite into one or more trunks (e, I), usually larger in size but fewer in number than those of the afferent vessels. The internal structure of lymphatic glands has been long a subject of inquiry. Hewson considered that a lymphatic gland essentially con- sists of a network of finely-divided lymphatic vessels, on and between which capillary blood-vessels are ramified ; the whole being gathered up and compacted into a comparatively dense mass by connective tissue, which at the surface of the gland forms for it an enclosing capsule. The afferent and efferent vessels are, according to Hewson, continuous with each other within the gland, and the cellular cavities described as inter- vening between them and serving as the medium of their communication, were held by him to be nothing more than partial dilatations of some branches of the common connecting plexus. Hewson's view of the constitution of the lymphatic glands was, until lately, accepted by most anatomists ; but modern researches have shown that the structure of these bodies is more complex. The fol-

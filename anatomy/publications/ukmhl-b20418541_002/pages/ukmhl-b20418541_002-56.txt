44 EPITHELIUM. stituent cells, or, at any rate, those forming the superficial layer, four principal varieties of epithelium have been recognised, as follows :— 1. The cells may become flattened into plates or scales, and the variety of epithelial tissue thus constituted is termed scaly, or tessellated (pavement epithelium of German histologists). It might be well to employ the former term when the flattened cells overlap at their edges (as in fig. 17), the latter where the adjoining edges meet; in which case the lines of junction may be even (as in fig. 18), or more or less sinuous, as in various parts of the lymphatic system (fig. 19).

In a second variety named columnar (cylinder-epithelium of the Germans) the cells assume a prismatic figure, and are set upright on the surface which they cover (fig. 20). Fig. 19. Fig. 20.

The cells may retain their primitive roundness, or, being flattened where they touch acquire a polyhedral or cubical figure, in which no one dimension remarkably predominates : in some places, however, the cells show a tendency to lengthen into columns and in others to flatten into tables, presenting thus transitional forms between the other varieties. This variety of epithelium has been named spheroidal and transitional. 4. Lastly the cells, which in this case are mostly prismatic in form,

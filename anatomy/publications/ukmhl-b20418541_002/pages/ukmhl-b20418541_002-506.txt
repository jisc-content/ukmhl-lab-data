THE SPINAL COED. 402 The terminal filament (filum terminate, central ligament) (fig. 346, l, I.) descends in the middle line amongst the nerves composing the cauda equina, and, becoming blended with the lower end of the sheath opposite to the first or second sacral vertebra, passes on to be fixed to the lower end of the sacral canal, or to the base of the coccyx. Fig. 345. Yig. 345.—Posterior View of the Medulla Oblongata and of the Spinal Cord with its Coverings and the Roots of the Nerves (from Sappey). 4 The theca or dura-niatral sheath has been opened by a median incision along the whole length, and is stretched out to each side. On the left side, in the upper and middle parts (A and B), the posterior roots of the nerves have been removed so as to expose the liga- mentum denticulatum ; and along the right side the roots are shown passing out through the dura mater. The roman numbers indicate the different nerves in the cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral regions ; 9, several of the pointed processes of the ligamentum den- ticulatum ; 10, origin of several posterior roots ; 11, posterior median fissure ; 12, ganglia of the spinal nerves ; 13, part of the anterior roots seen on the left side ; 14, the united nerve ; 15, tapering lower end of the spinal cord ; 16, filum terminale ; 17, cauda equina. Internally, it is a prolongation for about half its length of some of the nervous elements of the cord ; externally, it consists of a tube of the pia mater or innermost membrane, which, being attached at its lower end to the dura mater and vertebral canal, keeps pace with the latter in its growth, whilst the cord relatively shortens. It is distin- guished by its silvery hue from the nerves amid which it lies. Small blood-vessels may sometimes be seen upon it. Fissures.—When removed from the vertebral canal, and divested

178 BLOOD-VESSELS. from the reticulating processes of the cells. This coating has been named by His, the adventit 'ia capillaris. In vessels one or two degrees larger (small arteries and veins), there is added outside the epithelioid layer (fig. 119, a, a), a layer of plain Fig. 119. Fig. 119.—A Small Artery A, and vein V, from the Subcutaneous Connective Tissue op the Rat. Treated with Nitrate op Silver. 175 Diameters. a, a', epithelioid cells with b, V, their nuclei ; m, m, transverse markings due to staining of substance between the muscular fibre-cells; c, c, nuclei of connective tissue corpuscles attached to exterior of vessel. muscular tissue, in form of the usual oblong contractile fibre-cells, ■which are directed across the length of the vessel (fig. 119, m, m). The elongated nuclei of these cells may be brought into view by means of acetic acid, as shown in fig. 120. This layer corresponds with the middle or muscular coat of the arteries. In the smallest vessels in which it appears the muscular cells are few and apart, and a

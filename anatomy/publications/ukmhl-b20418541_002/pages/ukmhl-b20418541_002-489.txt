STRUCTURE OF THE GRAAFIAN FOLLICLES. 475 more developed follicles. One of these situated next the cavity is com- posed of condensed fine connective tissue : it contains a network of Fig. 33G.

The other, called the fibrous tunic, is more strongly fibrous, and forms a condensed layer situated close to the first. But, excepting in their greater degree of condensation, these layers do not differ essentially from the tissue of the ovarian stroma. Tunica granulosa.—Within the vascular or proper tunic of the follicle, and adherent to its inner surface, there is a distinct lining of

202 SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. close investment to the tendon. The space between these portions of the membrane is lubricated with synovia and crossed obliquely by one or more folds or duplications of the membrane, in some parts inclosing elastic tissue (Marshall). These are named " frsena," and pass from one part of the membrane to the other. Structure of synovial membranes.—The synovial membranes are composed essentially of connective tissue with blood-vessels and nerves. It was formerly stated that they were lined with an epithe- lioid layer of flattened cells, similar to those lining the serous mem- branes, but, as was shown by Hitter, there exists on the synovial membranes no complete lining of the kind. Patches of cells may, it is true, here and there be met with which present an epithelioid appearance (fig. 134, e\ as, indeed, we know to be the case in the con- nective tissue of other parts ; but most of the surface-cells of the synovial membranes are of the irregularly-branched type (fig. 134, s), the surface of the membrane between the cells and sometimes also over them being formed by the ground substance of the connective tissue,, whilst here and there small blood-vessels come to the surface from Fig. 135.

The cells and cell-spaces of the synovial mem- brane are at many places considerably smaller than those of the connec- tive tissue generally : this is owing to a scantiness in the amount of protoplasm, the nuclei being of the usual size and often appearing almost to fill the body of the cell. Sometimes the cell-spaces with

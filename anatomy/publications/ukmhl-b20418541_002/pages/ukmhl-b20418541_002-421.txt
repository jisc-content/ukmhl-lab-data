STRUCTURE OF THE TUBULES. 407 The convoluted tubes (tubuU contorti), which form the greater part of the cortical substance, and, together with vessels and connecting stroma, the whole of its outermost portion, vary in diameter, but corn- Fig. 290. 2 /• ^Fig. 290.—Tubes op Henle, from the Pig's Kidney. 400 diameters (Kolliker). 1, loop formed by the narrower variety of Henle's tube; 2, passage of the broader variety, a, into the narrower, b ; 3, loop formed by the broader variety of tube, with granular epithelium. monly maintain the same average width as the smaller straight tubes, namely -^oth of an inch. In the convoluted tubes the epithelium is extremely granular, the nuclei are, in the fresh state, for the most part obscured, and the epithelium in many cases almost fills the tubule, so as to leave but a comparatively small lumen. In most animals it is scarcely possible to make out the lines of junction between the individual cells (fig. 288, b, from the dog), but in the human kidney the latter are much more distinct (fig. 288, a, a'), being separated by clefts, which extend almost to the basement membrane.

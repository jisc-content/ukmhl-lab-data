STRUCTURE OF SEROUS MEMBRANES. 197 parietes or upon each other, and their motion is rendered smoother by the lubricating fluid. The outer surface most commonly adheres to the parts which it lines or covers, the connection being effected by means of areolar tissue, named therefore " subserous," which, when the membrane is detached, gives to its outer and previously adherent surface a flocculent aspect. The degree of firmness of the connection is very various : in some parts, the membrane can scarcely be separated ; in others, its attachment is so lax as to permit easy displacement. The latter is the case in the neighbourhood of the openings through which abdominal hernias pass ; and accordingly, when such protrusions of the viscera happen to take place, they usually push the peritoneum before them in form of a hernial sac. The visceral portion of the arachnoid membrane is in some measure an exception to the rule of the outer surface being everywhere adherent; for, in the greater part of its extent, it is thrown loosely round the parts which it covers, a few fine fibrous bands being the sole bond of con- nection ; and a quantity of pellucid fluid is interposed, especially in the vertebral canal and base of the cranium, between the arachnoid and the pia mater, which is the membrane immediately investing the brain and spinal cord. Structure and properties.—Serous membranes are thin and trans- parent, so that the colour of subjacent parts shines through them. They are tolerably strong, with a moderate degree of extensibility and elasti- city. They are lined on the inner surface by a simple epithelioid layer of flattened cells (fig. 132), each of which contains a clear, round or oval nucleus with one or two nucleoli. The outlines of the cells may readily Fig. 132.—Portion op Epithelioid Layer of Peritoneum from Diaphragm of Rabbit (Klein.) a, larger cells ; b, smaller ones, with, here and there a pseudostoma between.

THE CEREBRUM. 531 the opposite side to form the optic commissure, from the fore part of which the optic nerves proceed. Limited behind by these diverging peduncles, and in front by the converging optic tracts, is a lozenge-shaped interval, called the iiiicrpe- duncular space, in which are found, in series from behind forwards, the Fig. 376.

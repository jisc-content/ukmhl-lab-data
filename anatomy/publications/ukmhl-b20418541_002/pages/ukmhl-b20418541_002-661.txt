THE MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH. 647 462). At the ampullae they are thicker and less translucent than in the rest of their extent, and nearly fill their bony cases. That part of each which is towards the concavity of the semicircle of the canal is free ; whilst the opposite portion is fixed to the wall of the bony canal ; and in the ampulla this part is flattened, receives branches of nerves and blood- vessels, and presents on its inner surface a transverse projection, septum transversum or crista acustka, which partly divides the cavity into two. Auditory nerve: vestibular division.—At the bottom of the meatus auditorius internus the auditory nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior branch, which, broken up into minute filaments, pass through the perforations of the cribriform plate which separates the meatus from the internal ear, and are distributed respectively to the cochlea and vestibule. In both branches, as well as in the trunk, there are numerous nerve-cells. The vestibular nerve (fig. 459) divides into five branches, which proceed respectively to the utricle, the saccule, and the three ampullae of the semicircular canals ; those for the utricle and the superior and external semicircular canals enter the cavity in a group along the crista vestibuli; the fibrils for the sacculus (q) enter the ves- tibule by a smaller group of foramina, which are situated below those just described, and open at the bottom of the fovea hemispherica ; the branch for the posterior semicircular canal is long and slender, and traverses a small passage in the bone behind the foramina for the nerve Fig. 461.

AREOLAR TISSUE. 5.5 Fir. 28. OF Fig. 28. — Filaments AND SMALLER BUNDLES, AS POWER OF 400 DIAMETERS. Areolar Tissue, in larger seen under a magnifying not only occur in the areolar tissue strictly so called, but form the chief part of the tendons, ligaments, and other white fibrous connective tissues. They were long supposed to be the only fibrous con- stituent existing in the areolar tissue, but it is now well known that fibres of another kind are intermixed with them ; these agree in all characters and are obviously identical with the fibres of the yellow elastic tissue, and have accordingly been named the yellow or elastic fibres, to dis- tinguish them from the white or waved filaments above de- scribed. In certain portions of the areolar tissue, as for instance in that which lies under the serous and mucous membranes of particular regions, the yellow or elastic fibres are abundant and large, so that they cannot well be overlooked ; but in other parts they are few in number, and Fis- 20. small, and are then in a great measure hidden by the white filaments ; in such cases, however, they can always be rendered conspicuous under the microscope by means of acetic acid, which causes the white filaments to swell up and become in- distinct, whilst the elastic fibres, not being affected by that re-agent, come then more clearly into view (fig. 29). More- over, they resist the action of boiling alka- line solutions of potash and soda, of moderate strength, which very speedily destroy the rest of the tissue.

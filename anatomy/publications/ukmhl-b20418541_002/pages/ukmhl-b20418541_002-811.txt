FORMATION OF THE GEE AT VEINS. 797 part of its extent it becomes the external jugular vein ; and near its lower end it receives small branches, which grow to be the external jugular and subclavian Fig. 594. â€” Diagrams illustrating THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GrREAT Veins (after Kolliker).

The inferior vena cava is a vessel of later development, which opens into the trunk of the umbilical and omphalo-mesenteric veins, above the venas hepaticas reve- hentes. The iliac veins, which unite to form the inferior vena cava, communi- cate with the cardinal veins. The inferior extremities of the cardinal veins are persistent as the internal iliac veins. Above the iliac veins the cardinal veins are obliterated in a considerable part of their course ; their upper portions then become continuous with two new vessels, the posterior vertebral vein* of Rathke, which receive the lumbar and intercostal twigs. As development proceeds, the direction of the ducts of Cuvier is altered by the descent of the heart from the cervical into the thoracic region, and becomes continuous with that of the primitive jugular veins. A communicating branch makes its appearance, directed transversely from the junction of the left sub- clavian and jugular veins, downwards, and across the middle line to the right jugular : and further down in the dorsal region between the posterior vertebral veins a communicating- branch passes obliquely across the middle line from right

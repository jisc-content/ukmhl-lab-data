PULMONARY VESSELS. 277 Fig. 185. Fig. 185.—An Alveolus from the Lung of a new-born Child, stained with Nitrate of Silver to show the Epithelium (F. E. Sehultze). 500 Diameters. Some of tlie cells are much more distinct and granular than the rest. to be found free in the air-cells and smaller bronchial tubes : not unfrequently they contain carbonaceous particles. It is conceivable that by the migration of these cells into the pulmonary tissue, the carbon particles may be conveyed into the substance of the lung and thence into the lymphatics and bronchial glands.

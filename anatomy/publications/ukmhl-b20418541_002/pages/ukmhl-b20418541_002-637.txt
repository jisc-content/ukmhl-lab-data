THE LENS. 623 the outer portion is soft and easily detached; the succeeding layers are of a firmer consistence; and in the centre the substance becomes much harder, constituting the so-called nucleus. On the anterior and posterior surfaces are faint white lines directed from the poles towards the circumference; these in the adult are somewhat variable and numerous Fig. 434. Fig. 434.—Front View of the Fibrous Structure of the Adult Lens (from Sappey after Arnold), f In this figure more numerous planes of intersection of the fibres are shown than in fig. 433. Fig. 435. Fig. 435.—Laminated Structure of the Crystalline Lens, shown after hard- ening in Alcohol (Arnold). { on the surface (fig. 434), but in the foetal lens throughout, and towards the centre of the lens in the adult, they are three in number, diverging from each other like rays at equal angles of 120° (fig. 433, b and c). The lines at opposite poles have an alternating position (not being over one another), thus of those seen on the posterior surface, one is directed vertically upwards (fig. 433, b), and vol. II. Fig. 436. Fig. 436.—Fibres of the Crystal- line Lens. 350 Diameters. A, longitudinal view of the fibres of the lens from the ox, showing the ser- rated edges. B, transverse section of the fibres of the lens from the human eye (from Kolliker). C, longitudinal view of a few of the fibres from the equatorial region of the human lens (from Henle). Most of the fibres in C are seen edgeways, and, towards 1, present, the swellings and nuclei of the '' nuclear zone ; " at 2, the flattened sides of two fibres are seen. s s

433 STRUCTURE OF CORPORA CAVERNOSA. and plain muscular tissue, and named trabecule, pass inwards, and run through and across the cavity in all directions, thus subdividing it into Fig. 313.—Portion of the Erectile Tissue of the Corpus Cavernosum mag- nified, SHOWING THE AREO- LAR Structure and the Vascular Distribution (from J. Miiller). a, a small artery supported by the larger trabecular, and branching out on all sides ; c, the tendril-like arterial tufts or helicine arteries of Miiller ; d, the areolar structure formed by the finer trabeculse. a multitude of interstices occupied by tortuous veins, and giving the entire structure a spongy character. The trabecular "whether lamelliform or cord-like, are larger and stronger near the cir- cumference than along the centre of each cavernous body, and they also become gradually thicker towards the crura. The venous interspaces, conversely, are larger in the middle than near the surface ; their long Fig. 314. 1 Fig. 314.—Erectile Tissue from the peripheral part of the Corpus Cavernosum Penis, magnified with a low power (from Frey after Langer). 1, a and b, superficial and deeper cortical network of veins ; 2, a, a, passage of arterial ramuscules into the veins of the deeper cortical network. diameter is, in the latter situation, placed transversely to that of the penis : and they become larger towards the forepart of the penis. They are lined by a layer of flattened epithelioid cells similar to that lining other veins. The trabecula3 contain the ordinary white fibrous tissue and fine elastic fibres, together with a considerable quantity of pale F F 2

Fig. 585.—Human Embryos at different early stages of development, showing the Heart in its tubular condition. A, upper half of the body of a human embryo of three weeks, viewed from the abdominal side (from Coste); a, frontal plate ; 6, protovertebras, on which the primitive aorta? are lying ; 3, the middle of the tube of the heart, below it the place of en- trance of the great veins, above it the aortic bulb. B, lateral view of a human embryo more advanced than that last referred to, and somewhat imperfectly developed (from A. Thomson); a, the frontal part of the head ; b, the vertebral column ; v, the wide communication of the umbilical vesicle or yolk-sac with the intestine; u, communication with the allantoisor urachus; 2, auricular part of the heart connected with the veins posteriorly ; 3, ventricular part of the bent tube; 4, the aortic bulb ; near the extremities of the tube the divided peri- cardium is seen. portions, of which that originally posterior and receiving the veins is the widest, and constitutes the primitive auricle ; the middle one, next Fig. 586. Fig. 586.—Diagrammatic Outlines of the Heart and First Arterial Vessels of the Embryo, as seen from the Abdominal Surface. A, at a period corresponding to the 36th or 38th hour of incubation in the chick ; B, and C, at the 48th hour of incubation ; 1, 1, primitive veins ; 2, auricular part of the heart; 3, ventricular part; 4, aortic bulb ; 5, 5, the primitive aortic arches, and their continuation as descending aorta ; these vessels are still separate in their whole extent in A, but at a later period, as shown more fully in C, have coalesced into one tube in a part of the dorsal region; in B, below the upper 5, the second aortic arch is formed, and

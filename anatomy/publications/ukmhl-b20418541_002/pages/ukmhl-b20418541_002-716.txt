702 THE FCETAL MEMBRANES. material of the yolk is probably absorbed by these vessels and conveyed by them as nourishment into the system of the embryo. In many of these animals however a quantity of the yolk substance also remains at the end of incubation, and by actual transference into the intestine of" the embryo serves for a time as its digestible food. In mammals the yolk-sac grows for a time with the embryo and other parts of the developing ovum, and the yolk substance within it must undergo a corresponding increase. There are however great differences among the different tribes of mammals in the extent of the development of the yolk-sac during uterogestation. In some it remains large and vascular, while in others it becomes atrophied and its vessels are obliterated at a comparatively early period. In rodentia it attains its Fig. 513.

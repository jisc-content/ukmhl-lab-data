258 THE HEART. the orifices, towards the apex of the heart, where they pass with an abrupt twist into the interior of the left ventricle. Their general direction is not vertical but oblique, especially in front (fig. 177), just as if while the base of the organ remained fixed the apex had been twisted half round in the direction of the hands of a watch. They form a distinct thin superficial stratum, best marked at the back of Fig. 177. Fig. 177.—Surface Fibres of Ventricles of Human Heart from the front and below (Reid). b, bundle of fibres emerging from the interior of the left ventricle at the vortex a, and crossing the lower part of the septum uninterruptedly. At d the sm*face fibres are somewhat interrupted. the right ventricle, for here the direction of the fibres is quite different from those immediately beneath. At the back they pass over the septum without turning in : at the front they are somewhat interrupted by fibres which come out from the septum ; except towards the base and apex, where they cross uninterruptedly from one ventricle to the other (fig. 177). To trace the further course of the surface fibres it is necessary to open the left ventricle. When this is done, and the endocardium cleared away, it is seen that there are here two sets of fibres with which the superficial fibres become continuous. The first of these consists of bundles derived mainly from the left (or anterior) set of papillary muscles, which pass down to the apex of the cavity, turning as they emerge in a half circle around the front of the apex to the right side {fig. 178, V). They are continuous on the outside chiefly with those superficial fibres which cross the lower part of the septum in front, and which, spreading out, are attached above to the posterior parts •of the tendinous rings at the base. The second set, on the other hand, comes chiefly from the right or posterior papillary muscles, and,

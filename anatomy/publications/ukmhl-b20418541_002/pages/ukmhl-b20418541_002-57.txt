NUCLEUS OF EPITHELIUM-CELL. 45 bear on their basal or free ends spontaneously moving filaments, named cilia; on which account this variety of epithelium is termed ciliated (fig. 21).

Fig. 22. — Diagram of Section of Stratified Epithelium, in which the under- most CELLS ARE OBLONG AND VERTICAL. When the cells of an epithelium are arranged in several superimposed layers instead of being in a simple layer, it is termed stratified: in Fig. 23. Fig. 23.—Epithelium of Conjunctiva of Calf. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, progressive flattening of the cells as they rise to the surface. The out- line figures represent single cells from different depths, viewed on their surface ; and at 4' and 5', edgeways. Magnified 410 diameters (chiefly after Henle). these cases it is commonly found that the lowermost layer is columnar in shape, and the uppermost scaly ; the intermediate strata presenting transitions between these forms (figs. 22, 23). The first three of the varieties here enumerated present local pecu- liarities which make it convenient to describe them with the tissues or organs with which they are associated. The ciliated epithelium, on the other hand, being of nearly uniform character as regards situation, vital properties and functional activity, can be most conveniently treated of under one general head, and will therefore be considered here. It may first be remarked, however, that amidst these changes the nucleus of the cell undergoes little alteration, and its characters are accordingly remarkably uniform throughout (see figs.). It is round or oval, and more or less flattened ; its diameter measures from go^th^to T-^ooth of an inch, or more. Its substance is insoluble in acetic acid,

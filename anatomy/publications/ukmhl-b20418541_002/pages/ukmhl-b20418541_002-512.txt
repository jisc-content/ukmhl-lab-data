THE SPINAL CORD. 498 taining nuclei and pigment ; secondly, there are smaller cells, ranging from to of an inch, the majority being from tJqo to -gfa of an inch in size. The smaller cells occur scattered throughout the whole of the grey matter, and are aggregated also in the substantia gelatinosa at the ex- tremity of the caput cornn posterioris, where they are scattered in a finely granular basis, and among them pass many fine nerve-fibres derived from, the posterior roots. The larger cells are collected into groups. In the anterior horn they are placed chiefly in its anterior and in its outer portions, although scattered cells occur throughout the cornu. The two groups (with Spinal Marrow in the Lumbar En- largement.

Three groups of cells are seen in the anterior cornu ; of these the anterior are external and internal, the posterior are chiefly external or lateral. which the anterior nerve-roots are connected) are well defined, espe- cially in the cervical and lumbar enlargements. The outer group is usually cylindrical, the anterior prismatic in form, and the latter is often broken up into two or three smaller groups.

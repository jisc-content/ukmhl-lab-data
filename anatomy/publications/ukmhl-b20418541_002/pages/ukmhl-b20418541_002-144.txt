130 NERVOUS TISSUE. certain amount of granular protoplasm, may be seen near the middle of each segment. The primitive sheath turns in at the nodes and surrounds the axis-cylinder as this passes from one segment to the other, so that the sheath is in a manner perforated by the axis-cylinder. The sheaths of successive segments are not directly continuous over the nodes, but are there separated by a certain amount of clear intersegmental substance (shown in a. fig. 82), which forms the " constricting band" of Eanvier, and is probably similar in nature to ordinary intercellular or cementing substance (see p. 15), being like that stained by nitrate of silver. The last-named reagent stains also the axis-cylinder in the neighbourhood of the node, so that the fibres after this treatment appear marked with little crosses (fig. 83) ; the transverse limb of the cross being due to the ring of intersegmental substance, the longitu- dinal to the axis-cylinder. Other staining fluids, such as the picrocar- minate of ammonia, also act on the axis-cylinder at the nodes ; they are probably prevented from reaching it elsewhere owing to the presence of the fatty matter in the surrounding medullary sheath.

Cross markings are seen at the nodes, and the layer of flattened epithelioid cells which covers the surface is also brought into view. Fig. 84.—Fibres from the Root of a Spinal Nerve. At a, where they join the spinal cord, they are varicose ; lower down at b, they are uniform and larger (from Valentin). No structure corresponding to Eanvier's nodes has, it is believed, hitherto been observed in the non-medullated fibres ; they appear to be absent also in the white fibres of the brain and spinal cord. Varicose fibres.—Many of the medullated nerve-fibres, when sub- jected to the microscope, appear dilated or swollen out at short distances

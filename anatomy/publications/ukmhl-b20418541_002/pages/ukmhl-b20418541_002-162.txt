Krause has described peculiar organs in the skin of the penis and clitoris, allied to the end-bulbs, which he proposes to call genital nerve-corpuscles. They are various in form, but present a mulberry-like surface. One, or two, rarely three or four, dark- bordered nerve fibres enter each of them. They have a delicate sheath of connective tissue, with many nuclei, and soft finely granular contents allied to the core of the end- bulbs.

THE EAR. 625 Fig. 440. Fig. 440.- -DlAGRAMMATIC VlEW FROM BEFORE OF THE PARTS COMPOSING of Hearing of the Left Side (after Arnold). the Organ The temporal bone of the left side, with the accompanying soft parts, has been detached from the head, and a section has been carried through it transversely so as to remove the front of the meatus externus,half the tympanic membrane, and the upper and anterior wall of the tympanum and Eustachian tube. The meatus internus has also been opened, and the bony labyrinth exposed by the removal of the surrounding parts of the petrous bone. 1, the pinna and lobe ; 2 to 2', meatus externus ; 2', membrana tympani ; 3, cavity of the tympanum ; 3', its opening backwards into the mastoid cells ; between 3 and 3', the chain of small bones ; 4, Eustachian tube ; 5, meatus internus containing the facial (upper- most) and the auditory nerves ; 6, placed on the vestibule of the labyrinth above the fenestra ovalis ; a, apex of the petrous bone ; b, internal carotid artery ; c, styloid pro- cess ; d, facial nerve issuing from the stylo-mastoid foramen ; e, mastoid process ; f, squamous part of the bone covered by integument. -Outer Surface of the Pinna of the Right Auricle. 1 441. 1, helix ; 2, fossa of the helix ; 3, antihelix ; 4, fossa of the antihelix; 5, antitragus ; 6, tragus ; 7, concha; 8, lobule. Fig. 441. concha, and projecting backwards over the meatus auditorius, is a conical prominence, the tragus (fig. 441, 6), covered usually with hairs. Behind this, and separated from it by a deep notch (incisura intertragica), is another smaller elevation, the antitragus (5).' Beneath the antitragus, and forming the lower end of the auricle, is the lobule (8), which is devoid of the firmness and elasticity that characterise the rest of the pinna. The thinner and larger por- tion of the pinna is bounded by a prominent and incurved margin, the Mix (1), which, springing above and rather within the tragus, from the hollow of the

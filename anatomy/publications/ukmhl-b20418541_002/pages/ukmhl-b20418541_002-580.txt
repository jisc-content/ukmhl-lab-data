roots of the nerves. ORIGIN OF NERVES. TIONS of the Principal 5G6 wards too far) ; VII b, the The first or olfactory nerve, or tract, is attached to the under surface of the frontal lobe, in front of the anterior perforated space, by three roots, named external, middle, and internal. The external or long root passes outwards as a band of white fibres, along the anterior margin of the perforated space, towards the posterior border of the fissure of Sylvius, where it disappears. Its fibres have been traced by different observers to the island of Eeil, the optic thalamus (Valentin), and to a nucleus in the substance of the temporo- sphenoidal lobe, in front of the anterior extremity of the hippocampus (Rolando, Luys, Foville). The middle or grey root is of pyramidal shape, and consists of grey matter on the surface continuous with the adjacent grey substance of the anterior perforated space. Within it are white fibres, which have been said to go to the corpus striatum, or to join the fibres of the inner root.

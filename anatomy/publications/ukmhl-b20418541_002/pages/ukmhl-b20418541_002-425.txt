411 BLOOD-VESSELS OF THE KIDNEYS. Fig. 296. Fig. 297. Fig. 297. — Injected Glome- rulus PROM THE INNER PART op the Cortical substance of the Horse's Kidney. 70 diameters (from. Kolliker after Bowman). a, interlobular artery; af, efferent artery ; m, m, convo- luted vessels of the glomerulus ; eff efferent or straight arteriole ; b, its subdivision in the medul- lary substance. Fig. 296.—Diagram op the Distribution of the Blood-vessels in the Kidney (from Ludwig). ai, ai, interlobular artery giving off numerous vasa afferentia to the glomeruli, <j • the vasa cfferentia are seen to break up into capillaries amongst the convoluted tubules in the cortical substance, and their blood is collected partly by the vena? stellata? or stellulse, v s, near the suface of the kidney, partly by the interlobular veins, vi, vi, which accompany the interlobular arteries. From the lowermost glomeruli some of the vasa efferentia pass down amongst the straight tiibules of the medullary substance as the so-called false arteria? recta?, ar'. The true arteria? rectse, ar, spring directly from the main branches of the renal artery, or from the interlobular arteries, and run down in bundles, ab, towards the apex of the pyramid, breaking up into capillaries with long meshes. Their blood is returned to the interlobular veins, vi, by the vena? recta?, vr. vp} represents the fine venous plexus around the apices of the pyramids.

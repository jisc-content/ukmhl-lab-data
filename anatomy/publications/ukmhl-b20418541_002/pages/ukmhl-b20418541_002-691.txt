SEGMENTATION OF THE GERM. 67*7 a layer of organised cells. This new organised structure, the blasto- derm of Pander, is the future seat of embryonic development. A segmenting process of this kind is universal throughout animals as a prelude to the commencement of embryonic development; but it ■differs greatly in its extent, and somewhat also in its nature, according to the proportional relation of the directly germinal to the nutritive components of the yolk in different classes of animals. Thus in mam- mals, the process of cleavage appears to be complete, or to involve the whole mass of the yolk protoplasm, with which the germ is coextensive, at least in the first steps of the process; while in the bird's egg, which is pre-eminently mcroWastic, the segmentation is restricted in the first instance to the disc of the cicatricula, and the great mass of the yolk substance takes no share in the change. In intermediate forms of ova, as in amphibia and osseous fishes the segmenting division extends to a greater or less width over the yolk, Fig. 492.

(From Bischoff.) 2f A, the ovum from the middle part of the tube twelve or fifteen hours after impreg- nation, the germinal vesicle has disappeared, the yolk is contracted, and two hyaline globules are seen m the cavity between it and the zona ; rotation of the yolk took place in the direction of the arrows ; B, ovum a little more advanced, the first segmentation has taken place, a clear globule or nucleus is seen in both the yolk spheres : spermatozoa adhere everywhere to the zona ; C, an ovum four hours later than that shown in B, the second segmentation has taken place ; D, ovum from the lower part of the tube in which the third stage of segmentation is completed, and eight yolk spheres are formed, the albuminous covering is increased in thickness : diameter of the whole, ^0th of an inch.

150 NERVOUS TISSUE. the layers of which they exist abundantly. They have been found on the pudic nerves in the glans penis and bulb of the urethra, on the intercostal nerves, sacral plexus, cutaneous nerves of the upper arm and neck, and on the infraorbital nerve. Lately they have been recognised on the periosteal nerves, and, in considerable numbers, on the nerves of the joints. They are found in individuals of all ages. The figure of these corpuscles is oval, somewhat like that of a grain of wheat,—regularly oval in the cat, but mostly curved or reniform in man, and sometimes a good deal distorted. Their mean size in the adult is from y^th to y^th of an inch long, and from -^gth to ^th of an inch broad. They have a whitish, opaline aspect : in the cat's mesentery they are usually more transparent, and then a white line may be distinguished in the centre. A slender stalk or peduncle attaches the corpuscle to the branch of nerve with which it is connected. The peduncle contains a single medullated nerve-fibre ensheathed in Fig. 103. Fig. 103.—a, Magnified View op a Pacinian Body from the Mesentery of a Cat (from a drawing by Professor Marshall), showing the lamellar structure, the capsules with their nuclei (the inner and closer series of capsules appearing darker in the figure) the nerve-fibre passing along the peduncle, and penetrating the capsules to reach the core in the central cavity, where it loses its strong, dark outline, and terminates by an irregular kno"b at the distal and here dilated end of the cavity. Connective tissue (neurilemma or perineurium) and blood-vessels are represented in the peduncle, and tortuous capillaries are seen running up among the capsules, b and c represent the termination of the nerve with the distal end of the central cavity and adjoining capsules, to illustrate varieties of arrangement. In b the fibre, as well as the core and adjoining capsules, is bifurcated.

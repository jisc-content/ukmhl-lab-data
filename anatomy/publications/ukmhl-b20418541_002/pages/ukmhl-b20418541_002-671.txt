THE ORGAN OP CORTI. G57 The ligamentum spiral© (fig. 469, LSp) appears in sections as a pointed projection from the outer wall of the cochlea, with the basilar membrane attached to its apex. It is composed Fig. 471. of a retiform connective tissue, many of the cells W&=ssa' of which have an elon- MUk gated shape and radiate from the point of attach- ment of the basilar mem- brane. They have been considered by some to be muscular, but there is no distinct proof of their contractile nature. Organ of Corti.— The epithelium which covers the basilar mem- brane requires a careful description, including as it does the highly- specialised structures which are known by the name of the organ of b Fig. 471.—A pair of Rods of Corti, from the Rabbit's Cochlea, in side view.

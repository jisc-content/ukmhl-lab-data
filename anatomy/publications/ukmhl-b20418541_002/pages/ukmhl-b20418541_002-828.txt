DEVELOPMENT OF THE TJBO-GEXITAL ORGANS. 814 single median cavity is produced which lies between the still separate canals of the Wolffian ducts. A large accumulation of tissue in its walls gives to the genital cord great thickness as compared with the neighbour- Fig. 60S.

The lower part of the united Miillerian ducts thus comes afterwards to form the foundation of the vagina and lower part of the uterus in the female, and the corresponding prostatic vesicle with its occasional accompani- ments, or the uterus masculinus of the male. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. In the farther history of the development of the genital organs it will be expedient to consider them in the two sexes in succession under Fig. 609.

Reproductive Glands.—It has already been explained that although the male and female productive organs take their origin from a mass of blastema which is on the whole identical in the two sexes, yet there are such differences in the development of the essential parts of the respective structures of the ovary and testicle as almost to warrant the conclusion that these organs are from the first in some measure distinct.

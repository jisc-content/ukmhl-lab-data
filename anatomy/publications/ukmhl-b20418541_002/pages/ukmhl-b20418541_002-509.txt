The letters and numbers indicate the position of each section : C 1, C 2, &c, at level of first cervical nerve, second cervical nerve ; D 1, &c., first dorsal, &c. ; L 1, &c, first lumbar, &c.; sac. 2, second sacral ; ca. 2, second coccygeal nerve. The grey substance is shaded dark, and the nerve-cells within it are indicated by dots. extending inwards from the surface. Most of these are irregular and indistinct, but in the cervical region a septum extends forwards and inwards from the fissure just described which bounds the posterior median column. This column is thus marked off from the rest of the posterior column as a wedge-shaped area on each side of the posterior median fissure. VOL. II. K K.

OLFACTORY NERVE. G71 The subject lias since been again carefully investigated by Martin, who upholds the correctness of Max Schultze's views.* Fig. 4SG. Fig. 4S6.—Nerves op the Septum Nasi, seen prom the bight side (from Sappey, after Hirschfeld and Leveille). § I, the olfactory bulb ; 1, the olfactory nerves passing through the foramina of the •cribriform plate, and descending to be distributed on the septum ; 2, the internal or septal twig of the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve ; 3, naso-palatine nerves. Pig. 487.—Nerves op the Outer Wall op the Nasal Fossae (from Sappey, after Hirschfeld and Leveille). § 1, network of the branches of the olfactory nerve, descending upon the region of the superior and middle turbinated bones ; 2, external twig of the ethmoidal branch of the nasal nerve ; 3, spheno- palatine ganglion ; 4, ramification of the anterior palatine nerves ; 5, posterior, and 6, middle divisions of the palatine nerves ; 7, branch to the region of the inferior turbinated bone ; 8, branch to the region of the superior and middle turbinated bones ; 9, naso-palatine branch to the septum cut short. 187. II Olfactory Herve.—The fila- ments of this nerve, lodged at first in grooves on the surface of the bone, enter obliquely the sub- stance of the Schneiderian mem- brane, and pass to their distribution between its mucous and fibrous layers. The nerves of the septum (fig. 486) are rather larger than those of the outer wall of the nasal fossse ; they extend over the upper third of the septum, and as they descend become very indistinct. The nerves of the outer wall are divided into two groups—the posterior * Exner, Wiener Sitzungsberichte, 1870 and 1872 ; H. Newell Martin, " Journal of Anat. and Physiol.," vol. viii. vol. ir. x x

DEVELOPMENT OF THE URO-GENITAL ORGANS. 308 a manner somewhat different. Both are mainly produced in the sub- stance which lies along the inner border of the blastemic mass already referred to, and which may therefore be named the common reproductive blastema; but with this important difference between them, that in the Fig. 604.—Transverse Section of the Wolffian Body and Rudiment of the Ovary and the Duct of Muller in an .Embryo Chick at the end of the fourth day (from Waldeyer). WK, Wolffian body ; y, section of the Wolffian duct ; a, germ epithelium with, o, o, cells enlarging into ovigerms; a', epithelium near the place of involution of Muller's duct, z ; E, stroma of the ovary ; m, mesentery ; L, lateral wall of the abdomen. female the primitive ova originate more immediately from the cells of the surface in the germ epithelium, and become afterwards imbedded as Graafian follicles in the deeper substance of the mass which forms a stroma round the ova ; while the glandular substance of the testicle is apparently developed within the cell mass, without any direct con- currence of the superficial or germ epithelium,—which, though at first existing in male as well as in female embryoes, and even exhibiting some tendency to the enlargement of some cells as ovigerms (Waldeyer), soon becomes atrophied and reduced in thickness in the male as the structure of the testicle becomes developed. The ducts of Muller open at their anterior extremities into the pleuro-peritoneal cavity by the orifice which ultimately becomes the infundibulum and fimbriated ostium abdominale ; and, as their lining membrane has originally been formed by an involution of the epithelium (germ-epithelium) of that cavity, it follows that the lining membranes of the female passages (Fallopian tubes and uterus) which in their later development assume the characters of mucous membrane, and are de- Fig. 604.

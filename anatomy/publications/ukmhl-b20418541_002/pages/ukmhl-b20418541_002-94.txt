82 BONE. On close inspection the cancellated texture is seen to be formed of slender bars or spicula of bone and thin lamellae, which meet together and join in a reticular manner, producing an open structure which has been compared to lattice-work (cancelli), and hence the name usually applied to it. In this way considerable strength is attained without undue weight, and it may usually be observed that the strongest laminae run through the structure in those directions in which the bone has naturally to sustain the greatest pressure. The open spaces or areolae of the bony network communicate freely together; in the fresh state they contain marrow or blood-vessels, and give support to these soft parts. Fig. 48. Fig. 48.â€”A, Transverse Section of a Bone (ulna) deprived op its earth by ACID. The openings of the Haversian canals seen. Natural size. A small portion is shaded to indicate the part magnified in Fig. B. B, Part op the Section A, magnified 20 diameters. The lines indicating the concentric lamellae are seen, and among them the lacunas appear as little dark specks. The compact tissue is also full of holes ; these, which are very small, are best seen by breaking across the shaft of a long bone near its middle and examining it with a common magnifying glass. Numerous little round apertures (fig. 48 a) may then be seen on the broken surface, which are the openings of short longitudinal passages running in the compact substance, and named the Haversian canals, after Clopton Havers, an English physician and writer of the seventeenth

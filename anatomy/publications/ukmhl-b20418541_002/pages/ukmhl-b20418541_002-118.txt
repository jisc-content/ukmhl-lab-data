Fig. 62.—Highly magnified Transverse Section op Superficial Part of Femur— Human Fcetus (Klein). a, b, c, periosteum ; c, internal layer, with numerous osteoblasts, passing in to form d, new bony growth, which is covered with osteoblasts, some of which are imbedded in it, forming bone corpuscles. Numerous blood-vessels are seen cut across, in the periosteal ingrowth, some filled with blood-corpuscles, others empty. the bone increases in length by the ossification continuing to extend into the intervening cartilage, which goes on growing at the same time; and it appears that in the part of the shaft already ossified little or no elongation takes place by interstitial growth. This is shown by an experiment first made by Hales and afterwards by Duhamel and by John Hunter, in which, two or more holes being bored in the growing bone of a young animal at a certain measured distance from each other, they are found after a time not to be farther asunder, although the bone has in the mean while considerably increased in length.* In like manner the shaft also increases in circumference by deposition of new bone on its external surface, while at the same time its medullary canal is enlarged by absorption from within.

Duhamel was led from some of his experiments to infer that an interstitial elongation took place near the ends ; but there is some doubt left as to the precise circumstances of the experiments in these cases. Both Hales and Duhamel, in experimenting on the growing tibia of a chicken,

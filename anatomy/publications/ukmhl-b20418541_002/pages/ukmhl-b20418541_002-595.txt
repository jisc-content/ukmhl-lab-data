As the result of observations made in reference to this subject, on the brains of 53 males and 34 females, between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-five, Dr. J. Reid has given the following table :— Males. Females. Difference* oz. drs. oz. drs. oz. drs. Average weight of cerebrum 43 lof 38 12 5 3f cerebellum 5 4 4 12| 07£ pons and medulla oblongata 0 15f 1 0| 0 <H- „ entire encephalon . . 50 3^ 44 8^ 5 11 With these results the observations of Huschke, derived from a special ex- amination of the brains of 22 females and 38 males, mainly agree. From this it appears; that the proportionate weight of the cerebellum to that of the cerebrum is, in the male, as one to 8f, and in the female, as 1 to 8|. The cerebellum attains its maximum weight from the twenty-fifth to the fortieth year ; but the increase in weight after the fourteenth year is shown to be relatively greater in the female than in the male. The whole cerebellum apart from the pons and medulla is heavier in the male ; the lateral lobes of the cerebellum are also heavier in the male. In the male the vermiform process increases gradually from the twentieth to the fiftieth year ; in the female it remains stationary during that period, and after the fiftieth year diminishes rapidly. In the new-bom infant the ratio of the weight of the cerebellum to that of the whole brain is strikingly different from that observed in the adult, being, according to Chaussier, between 1 to 13 and 1 to 26 ; by Cruveilhier it was found to be 1 to 20. Huschke found the weight of the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and pons together in the new-bom infant, as compared with that of the brain, to be in the proportion of 1 to 15, and 1 to 13. In the adult the proportions were 1 to 7, and 1 to 6. In most mammalia, the cerebellum is found to be heavier in proportion to the cerebrum, than it is in the human subject; in other words, the cerebrum in man is larger in proportion to the cerebellum. Soemmerring pointed out the fact that the brain is larger, in proportion to the nerves connected with it, in man than in the lower animals. A comparison of the width of the cerebrum with that of the medulla oblongata shows that the proportionate diameter of the brain to that of the medulla ob- longata is greater in man than in any animal, except the dolphin, in which creature, however, it must be remembered that the cerebral lobes exhibit a dis- proportionate lateral development. The width of the cerebrum in man, as

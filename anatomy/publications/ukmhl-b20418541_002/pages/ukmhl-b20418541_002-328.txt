314 THE TEETH. coats which afterwards are formed. From the bottom a papilla (p) meanwhile rises, soon becoming vascular, and assuming the shape of Fig. 214. Ruminant (after Kolliker). The three figures represent transverse sections of the gum and a part of the jaw at or shortly after the period of the formation of the germ, and are designed chiefly to show the relation o the germ to the epithelium. A, represents a very early condition, when the enamel-germ of a milk or temporary tooth has been formed by a down-growth of the deep layer of the epithelium. B, represents a later stage, when the tooth-papilla has risen from the surface of the mucous membrane, and has indented the enamel-germ. C, represents a more advanced stage in which the dental sac has begun to be formed. c, the superficial thick epithelium of the gum only sketched in outline ; c'. the deep layer ;/, the epithelial downgrowth ; /', the special enamel-germ, afterwards (in B and C) the enamel-organ ; p, the dental papilla, and afterwards tooth-pulp. In B and C a clear space is seen between the dental pulp and the deeper columnar cells, e, of the enamel-organ : it is probably produced by a shrinking of the soft parts away from one another ; s, the commencement of the dental sac ; / p, the enamel-germ of the correspond- ing permanent tooth.

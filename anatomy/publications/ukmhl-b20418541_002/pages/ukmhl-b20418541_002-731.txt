717 PENETRATION OF DECIDUA BY THE VILLI. From what has been previously stated, it will be seen that there is at first a general union or interpenetration of the villi of the chorion with the vascular decidua, the more extended part of this union taking place in the decidua reflexa, and the remainder in that portion of the decidua which is interposed between the ovum and the uterus, and which has been already referred to as decidua serotina, but which might from its relation to the formation of the placenta with propriety be named decidua placentalis. Already in the latter half of the second month of pregnancy, the villi on the uterine side of the chorion become larger and more ramified than those which run into the decidua reflexa ; and Fig. 521.

In the uterine wall the distinction is shown between the outer muscular part with the wide uterine vessels, and the glandular and decidual internal parts.

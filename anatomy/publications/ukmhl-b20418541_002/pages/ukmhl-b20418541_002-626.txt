THE EYE. 612 Fig. 422. Pig. 422.—The Nervous and Epithelial Elements op the Retina (Semidiagkam- matic). After Schwalbe. The numbers are the same as in fig. 419. The extent of the molecular layers is indicated merely by lines of shading. directly connected, or there is at most a short, comparatively thick stalk uniting the two (see fig.422). ,At the macula lutea, however, where only cone-grannies are met with, many of them are further removed from the limiting mem- brane, and the stalk is then longer and more attenuated. The nucleus of each, which, as in the case of the rod-grannies, occupies almost all the enlargement, contains a distinct nucleolus. The cone-fibre is very much thicker than the rod-fibres above described. It passes from the smaller end of the pear-shaped enlargement straight through the outer nuclear layer to reach the outer molecular layer, upon which it rests by a some- what spread-out end. From the edges of this, numerous exces- sively-fine fibrils pass into the substance of the molecular layer. Moreover a delicate striation or fibrillation has occasionally been described in the cone-fibre itself. 7. The layer of rods and cones.—Bacillary layer (fig. 422, 7). The elements which compose this layer are, as their name im- plies, of two kinds, those of the one kind—the rods—having an elongated cylindrical form; the cones on the other hand being- shorter, much thicker, bulged at the inner end or base, and termi- nated externally by a finer taper- ing portion. Both rods and cones are closely set in a pallisade-like manner over the whole extent of the retina between the membrana limitans externa and the pigmen- tary layer (fig. 419, 7); except at the macula lutea, where only cones are met with, the rods far exceed the cones in number. Their rela- tive number and arrangement is well exhibited when the layer is viewed from the outer surface, as in fig. 423, where a represents a portion of the layer from the macula lutea; b, from the im-

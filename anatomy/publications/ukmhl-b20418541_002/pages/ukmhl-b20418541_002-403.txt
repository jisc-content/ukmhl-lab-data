389 ABKANGEMENT OF BLOOD-VESSELS. Within the portal canals the branches of the portal veins receive small " vaginal veins," and also the " capsular veins," from the fibrous coat of the liver, both returning- blood which has been distributed by Fig. 276. p p k p h Fig. 276.—Capillary Network of the Lobules of the Eabbit's Liver (from Kolliker). About 40 Diameters. The figure is taken from a very successful injection of the hepatic veins made by Harting : it shows nearly the whole of two lobules, and parts of three others : p, portal branches running in the interlobular spaces ; h, hepatic veins penetrating and radiating from the centre of the lobules. .■■M°rO' ■ V>i'.f.\ C'-<'^ ■ ' Fig. 277.—Injected Twig of a Hepatic Vein with Sublobular Veins passing into the Hepatic Lobules (from Sappey).

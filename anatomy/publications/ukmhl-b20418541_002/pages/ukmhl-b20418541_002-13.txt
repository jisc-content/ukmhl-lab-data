GENEKAL ANATOMY. GENERAL CONSIDERATION'S ON THE TEXTURES. Enumeration of the Textures.—The human body consists of solids and fluids. Only the solid parts can be reckoned as textures, properly so called ; still, as some of the fluids, viz. the blood, chyle, and lymph, contain in suspension solid organised corpuscles of deter- minate form and organic properties, and are not mere products or secretions of a particular organ, or confined to a particular part, the corpuscles of these fluids, though not coherent textures, are to be looked upon as organised constituents of the body, and as such may not improperly be considered along with the solid tissues. In con- formity with this view the textures and other organised constituents of the frame may be enumerated as follows :— The blood, chyle, and lymph. Epithelial tissue, including epithelium, cuticle, nails, and hairs. Pigment. Connective tissue, viz. Areolar tissue. Adipose tissue. Fibrous tissue. Elastic tissue. Cartilage and its varieties. Bone or osseous tissue. Muscle. Nerve. Blood-vessels. Lymphatic vessels and glands. Serous and synovial membranes. Mucous membrane. Skin. Secreting glands. Vascular or ductless glands. Organic Systems.—Every texture taken as a whole was viewed by Bichat as constituting a peculiar system, presenting throughout its whole extent in the body characters either the same, or modified only so far as its local connections and uses render necessary; he accordingly used the term " organic systems " to designate the textures taken in this point of view, and the term was veiy generally employed by succeeding writers.

THE SPLEEN. 400 Vis. 283. (Busk and Huxley). The meshes are densely packed with lymphoid corpuscles, and the tissue is traversed by blood capillaries. The small arteries terminate in capillaries, the walls of which, as described by W. Miiller, after a longer or shorter course, lose their tubular character, the cells composing them acquiring pro- cesses and becoming connected by these with the connective tissue cells of the pulp. In this manner their blood flows directly into the interstices of the pulp tissue. The veins, which often, exhibit transverse markings, perhaps due to a corresponding arrangement of the retiform tissue on their surface, com- mence in this tissue in the same manner as the capillaries ter- minate ; that is to say, the layer of flattened cells which lines and mainly composes their walls, on being traced back, loses its epithelioid character, and the cells, becoming thickened and enlarged and their nuclei pro- minent, are found to be separated from each other, but connected by processes with, and passing into those of the pulp (fig. 285). The small veins take a dif- ferent course from the corresponding arteries, for they soon pass to and are conducted upon and within the trabecule, freely join- ing and anastomosing, whereas the arteries appear to have few or no anastomoses within the substance of the organ. From the description above given, it would appear that the blood in passing through the spleen is brought into immediate relation with the elements of the pulp, and no doubt Fig. 283. — Small Artery from Dog's Spleen with Malpightan Corpuscles at- tached. 10 Diameters (Kolliker).

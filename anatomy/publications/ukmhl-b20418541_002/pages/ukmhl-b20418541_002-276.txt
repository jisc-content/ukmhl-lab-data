THE HEART. 232 Soc. Medic. d'Observation de Paris, torn. i. p. 262. 1836. In some animals others are found which are only striated at their peri - phery, and present a beaded appearance, the component cells being much larger and more distinct; these, which are known as Purkinje's fibres, appear to represent a condition of arrested development of the ordinary cardiac fibres. Plain muscular fibre-cells have also been described in some situations ; and, in some animals, collections of adipose tissue are met with beneath the endocardium. The membrane is usually more opaque on the right side than on the left; and thicker in the auricles (the left especially) than in the ventricles ; it is, however, very thin on the musculi pectinati of the auricles and on the columns earner of the ventricles. DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT OP THE HEART. Size.—It was stated by Laennec, as the result of his experience, that the heart in its natural condition was about equal in size to the closed hand of the individual. It is about five inches long, three and a half in its greatest width, and two and a half in its extreme thickness from the anterior to the posterior surface ; but linear measurements of a flaccid organ like the heart must be subject to so many accidental variations as to render them of little value. Weight.—The weight of the heart in the adult is also subject to considerable variation, ranging between rather wide limits, which depend on the general weight of the body and on the sex. Its mean weight is about 9 or 10 oz. According to Eeid's tables, the average weight in the adult male is as high as 11 oz., and in the female 9 oz.; while according to Peacock the average of the male is 9| oz., and that of the female 9 oz. The weight of the heart maintains some general proportion to that of the body. According to Tiedemann this is about 1 to 160 ; by Clendinning it was found to be 1 to 158 in males, and 1 to 149 in females; and by Reid to be 1 to 169 in a series of thirty-seven males and 1 to 176 in twelve females ; but in the healthy males dying suddenly the ratio was as 1 to 173. It was shown by Clendinning that the heart continued to increase in weight up to an advanced period of life, but at a comparatively slower rate subsequently to the age of twenty-nine years. Subjoined is a tabular statement of some of the average results derived from the observations of these authors. CLENDINNING. EEID. PEACOCK. Weight in oz. Weight in oz. and drachms Age in years.

The greatest increase was detected in the substance of the left ventricle, and the ventricular septum * * Reid, in the Lond. and Edin. Monthly Journal of Med. Science, April 1843 ; T. B.

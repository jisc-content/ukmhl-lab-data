THE TEETIL 302 tissue of the gums, which closely surrounds the neck of the tooth. The fangs of all the teeth taper from the cervix to the point, and this Fist. 201 Fig. 201.—Vertical Section of Premolar op Cat. 15 diameters (Waldeyer). c, is placed in the pulp- cavity, opposite the cervix or neck of the tooth : the part above is the crown, that below is the root (fang). 1, enamel with radial and concentric markings ; 2, dentine with tubules and incremental lines ; 3, cement or crusta petrosa, with bone corpuscles ; 4, dental periosteum ; 5, bone of lower jaw. form, together with the accurate adjustment to the alveolus, has the effect of distributing the pressure during use over the whole socket, and of preventing it from un- duly bearing on the point of the fang, through which the blood- vessel s and nerves enter. The thirty-two perma- nent teeth consist of four incisors, two canines, four bicuspids, and six molars in each jaw. The twenty temporary teeth are four incisors, two canines, and four molars above and below. There are no bicuspids among the temporary teeth, the eight deciduous molars preceding eight bicuspids of the permanent set. The relative position and arrangement of the different kinds of teeth in the jaws may be expressed by the following formula, which also exhibits the relation between the two sets in these respects :— Temporary teeth. .

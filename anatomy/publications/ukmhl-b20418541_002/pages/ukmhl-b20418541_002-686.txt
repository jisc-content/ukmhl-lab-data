072 THE NOSE. branches being distributed over the surface of the upper spongy boney and the anterior branches descending over the plain surface of the- ethmoid and the middle spongy bone. The nerves as they descend, ramify and unite in a plexiform manner,, and the filaments join in brush-like and flattened tufts, which, spreading out laterally and communicating freely with similar offsets on each, side, form a fine network, with elongated and narrow intervals between the points of junction. In their nature the olfactory filaments differ much from the ordinary dark-bordered fibres of the cerebral and spinal nerves : they possess no medullary sheath, are pale, and finely granular in aspect, firmly adherent one to another, and have oval corpuscles on their surface (fig. 488). The greater part of the mucous membrane of the nasal fossa? is pro- vided also with nerves of common sensibility, derived from branches of the fifth pair : the distribution of these has already been de- scribed.

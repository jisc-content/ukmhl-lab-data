207 STRUCTURE OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES. form—and, in many parts, non-striatecl muscular tissue, variously disposed. The nerves also which belong to the mucous membrane are distributed in this part of its structure ; in some parts, the palate and Fig. 137. a Fig. 137.—Tubular Gland with adjacent Lymphoid Tissue, from Intestine of Rabbit (Verson). Highly magnified. K, lumen of gland ; a, a, epithelium with thickened striated border ; d, lymphoid tissue, from which most of the corpuscles have been removed. Between this and the •epithelium is seen the basement-membrane, b, in section. T, more condensed connective- tissue of the mucous membrane. vagina for instance, minute branches of the nerves have also been traced extending between and amongst the epithelium cells. The vessels exist almost universally in mucous membranes. The branches of the arteries and veins, dividing in the submucous tissue, send smaller branches into the corinm, which at length form a network of capillaries in the fibro-vascular layer. This capillary network lies immediately beneath the epithelium, or the basement-membrane when this is present, advancing with that membrane into the villi and papillae to be presently described, and surrounding the tubes and other glandular recesses. The lymphatics also form networks, which com- municate with plexuses of larger vessels in the submucous tissue ; their arrangement generally, as well as in the villi, has been already noticed. The fibres of connective tissue which enter into the formation of the corium are both the white and the elastic. The former are arranged in interlacing bundles, the elastic commonly in networks ; but the amount

INTERNAL STRUCTURE. 557 within the gyrus to which they belong, and are connected with the ante- rior perforated space, being joined by certain longitudinal fibres which run along the under surface of the corpus callosum near the middle line, passing near and upon the upper edge of the septum lucidum. Behind, they turn round the back of the corpus callosum and thence descend to the point of the middle lobe, where, according to Foville, they again reach the perforated space. Offsets from these fibres pass upwards and backwards into the secondary convolutions derived from the gyrus fornicatus in the longitudinal fissure. J). Fasciculus uncinatus —Under this name is described a white bundle, seen on the lower aspect of the hemisphere, passing across the bottom of the Sylvian fissure, and connecting the frontal with the temporo-sphenoidal lobe (fig. 388, e). The fibres of this bundle expand at each extremity, and the more superficial of them are curved or hooked sharply between the contiguous parts of the anterior and middle lobes,—whence it has derived its name. c. The convolutions of the cerebrum are connected with each other by white fibres, which lie immediately beneath the cortical substance.. Some of them pass across the bottom of the sulcus between adjacent convolutions ; whilst others, which are longer and run deeper, connect convolutions situated at a greater distance from one another.

Foville's Views.—The researches of Foville have led him to differ con- siderably from other anatomists as to the course of the fibres of the cerebrum, as will be seen from the following statement of his views. 1. The crust or fasciculated port Ion of each cerebral peduncle, derived from the anterior pyramid, forms by itself the peduncular fibrous cone, and is thence continued on into the radiating fibres of the cerebrum, which are destined only for the convolutions on the convex surface of the hemisphere, including the outer half of the marginal convolution of the longitudinal fissure, and the inner half of the convolution around the Sylvian fissure.

SIZE AND WEIGHT. 579 nution in weight, amounting to about 1 oz., during each subsequent decennial period ; thus confirming the opinion that the brain diminishes in advanced life. According to Peacock, the maximum weight of the brain is attained between the ages of twenty and thirty years. The table of Boyd inserted below would appear to show a somewhat earlier period as that at which the maximum is reached in both sexes, and that the period of decline scarcely begins before sixty years. With this result the observations of Huschke, made upon the brains of 359 men and 245 women, in general agree. (" Schadel, Hirn, und Seele des Menschen und der Thiere, &c," 1854.) B.

The brain of Cuvier weighed upwards of 64 oz.. and there are other recorded examples of brains belonging to men of great talent which nearly equalled it in weight. (Emile Rousseau, " Maladie et autopsie de M. G. Cuvier," Lancette Francaise. Mai 26,1832.) On the other hand, the brain in idiots is remarkably small. In three idiots, whose ages were sixteen, forty, and fifty years, Tiedemann found the weight of their respective brains to be 19| oz., 25| oz., and 22^ oz. ; and Dr. Sims records the case of a female idiot twelve years old, whose brain weighed 27 oz. Allen Thomson has found the brain of a dwarfish idiot girl seventeen years of age to weigh 18\ oz. after pre- servation in alcohol. The human brain is found to be absolutely heavier than that of all the lower animals except the elephant and whale. The brain of the elephant, according to Perrault, Moulins, and Sir A. Cooper, weighs between 8 and 10 lbs.; whilst that of the whale was found by Rudolphi, in a specimen 75 feet long, to weigh upwards of 5 lbs. The relative weight of the encepTialon to the bodg is liable to great variation; nevertheless, the facts to be gathered from the tables of Clendinning, Tiedemann,

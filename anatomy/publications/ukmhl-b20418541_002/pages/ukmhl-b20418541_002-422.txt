THE KIDNEYS. 403 Fig. 291. According to the descrip- tion of Heidenhain, the epithelium of these tubules mainly consists of minute thickly-set rod-shaped par- ticles, which rest by one end against the basement mem- brane, whilst the other pro- jects towards the centre of the tube, surrounding the nuclei, which are imbedded in a certain amount of un- altered protoplasm. He states that it is the optical sections of these " rods " which produce the well- known granular appearance of the epithelium of the convoluted tubules. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is very small in diameter, but has a distinct lumen, being lined by flattened cells, each with an oval nucleus which pro- duces a slight bulging into the interior of the tube (fig. 289, c, c ; fig. 290, 1). The ascending limb is much wider than the descending, but its lumen is comparatively small, for the epithelium approaches more in charac- ter to that of the convoluted tubules having a granular appearance, and almost fill- ing the tube (fig. 289, h ; fig. 290, 3). The bend of the loop is formed sometimes by the larger, sometimes by the smaller kind of tubule, Schweigger-Seidel. Imbedded among the convoluted tubules in irregular rows between the pyramids of Ferrein are the Malpighian cor- puscles. These are small rounded bodies about yi^th of an inch in dia- Fig. 291.â€”Diagrammatic Representation of a part of the straight and convo- luted Uriniferous Tubes with the Glomeruli (from Frey, after a drawing by Midler). b, b, two large straight tubes in the medullary substance of the pyramid ; c, con- voluted tubes with several of their terminations in the Malpighian capsules as in d ; a, three arteries passing up the pyramid and dividing into branches to the glomeruli ; the efferent vessels are also seen, and the network of capillaries between them and the veins. The looped tubules of Henle are not represented.

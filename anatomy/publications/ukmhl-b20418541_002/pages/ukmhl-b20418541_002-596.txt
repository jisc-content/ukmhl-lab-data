WEIGHT OF BRAIN AND COED. 532 compared with, that of the medulla oblongata at its base or broadest part, is about 7 to 1, while in many quadrupeds it is as 3 to 1 or even as 2 to 1. WEIGHT OF THE SPINAL CORD. Divested of its membranes and nerves, the spinal cord in the human subject weighs from 1 oz. to If oz., and therefore its proportion to the encephalon is about 1 to 33. Meckel states it as 1 to 40. The disproportion between the brain and the spinal cord becomes less and less in the descending scale of vertebrata, until at length, in cold-blooded animals, the spinal cord becomes heavier than the brain. Thus, in the mouse, the weight of the brain, in proportion to that of the spinal cord, is as 4 to 1 ; in the pigeon, as 31 to 1 ; in the newt only as § to 1 ; and in the lamprey, as to 1. In comparison with the size of the body, the spinal cord in man may be stated in general terms to be much smaller than it is in animals. In regard to the cold-blooded animals, to birds, and to small mammalia, this has been actually demonstrated, but not in reference to the larger mammalia. R. Wagner states as follows, the proportion of the weight of the spinal marrow taken as 1 to the encephalon and its parts— a, to the nerve roots : : 1 0-53 b, to the medulla and pons : : 1 1- c, to the cerebellum : : 1 5-18 d, to the cerebrum : : 1 42-78 e, to the encephalon : : 1 48-96 SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE ENCEPHALON. The specific gravity of the different parts of encephalon has of late at- tracted some attention from its having been observed that it varies to some extent in different kinds of disease. From the researches of Bucknill, Sankey, Aitken, and Peacock, it appears that the average specific gravity of the whole encephalon is about 1036, that of the grey matter 1034, and that of the white 1040. There are also considerable differneces in the specific gravity of some of the internal parts. (William Aitken. " The Science and Practice of Medicine," 1865, vol. ii. p. 265 : J. C.

146 NERVOUS TISSUE. sinuous, or somewhat tortuous in their course. They bear nuclei, some of which, no doubt, may appertain to the prolongation of the primitive sheath ; but others, generally fusiform and granular, are interposed, as Fig. 98.

These pale fibres often join into networks; but their further disposition in different parts will be treated of below. In the meantime it must be explained that the- original dark-bordered fibres which thus undergo division and change,, or which may proceed singly to end in a different and special manner, are commonly provided with a tolerably strong sheath with nuclei, which, as it stands well apart from the dark borders of the fibre, is very- conspicuous. This is sometimes considered to be only the primitive sheath of the fibre modified in character, but it seems more probable that it is derived from the neurilemma or perineurium which incloses the fine bundles or funiculi, and, as these part into smaller collections and single fibres, undergoes a corresponding division, and finally sends sheaths along single fibres. In further treating of the termination of nerves, it will be convenient to consider the sensory and motor nerves separately. Termination of sensory nerves.—Of the sensory, or, at least,, non-muscular nerves, the following modes of final distribution have hem recognised. A, By networks, or terminal plexuses. These are formed by the

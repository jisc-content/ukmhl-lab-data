Although it presents a few longitudinal white fibres on its surface, the corpus callosum consists almost entirely of fibres having a transverse course towards each side, and spreading in a radiating manner into the substance of the two hemispheres. As the transverse fibres from the anterior and posterior portions of the cerebrum are necessarily aggregated in large numbers near the corresponding ends of the corpus callosum, its greater thickness at those points, in comparison with the rest of its extent, is accounted for ; and, since the posterior lobe reaches further beyond the corpus callosum than the anterior, the greater thick- ness behind is also explained. Lateral ventricles, or ventriculi incomes.—By making a longi- tudinal cut through the corpus callosum at a short distance on each side of the middle line, and about midway between the two ends of the hemispheres, an opening is made into the right and left lateral ventricles of the brain (fig. 378). These ventricles form part of the general ventricular space within the cerebrum ; they are serous cavi- Fig. 378.—Horizontal Section of the Brain showing the Lateral Ventricles and the Fifth Ventricle opened (from Sappey after Vicq-d'Azyr). | 1, the fifth ventricle ; 2, the two laminae of the septum lucidum meeting in front of it ; 3, lesser hippocampus of the posterior cornu ; 4, horizontal section of the posterior swelling of the corpus callosum ; 5, middle part of the fornix, where it has been separated from the corpus callosum ; 6, posterior pilhir of the fornix ; 7, hippocampus major descending in the middle cornu ; 8, eminentia collaterals ; 9, lateral parts of the fornix ;

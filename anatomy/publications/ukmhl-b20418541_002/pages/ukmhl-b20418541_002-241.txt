227 SWEAT-GLANDS. microscope, is found to consist of a fine tube, coiled up into a ball (though sometimes forming an irregular or flattened figure); from which the tube is continued, as the duct of the gland, upwards through the Fig. 155.

The duct, as it passes through the epidermis, is twisted like a corkscrew, that is, in parts where the epidermis is sufficiently thick to give room for this ; lower down it is but slightly curved. Sometimes the duct is formed of two coiled-up branches which join at a short distance from the gland, as happens to be the case in the specimen repre- sented in fig. 156. The tube, both in the gland and where it forms the excretory duct, consists of an investment of connective tissue, con- tinuous with the corium, and reaching no higher than the surface of the true skin, a thin membrana propria and an epithelial lining, con- sisting of one or more strata of cells (often containing brownish pigment), and continuous with the epidermis, which alone forms the twisted part of the duct. The larger gland-ducts in the axilla, at the root of the penis, on the labia majora, and in the neighbour- hood of the anus, contain between their coats a layer of non-striated

INTERNAL PAETS. 545 convolution). The fascia dentata can be traced up to the pad or bour- relet : its upper part is free of dentations, and is sometimes named fasciola cincrea. The dentations correspond with blood-vessels passing to and from the choroid plexus. Fig. 382.

The velum interpositum or tela choroidea (fig. 382), the mem- brane which connects the choroid plexuses of the two sides together, is a prolongation of the pia mater through the transverse fissure. It corresponds in extent with the fornix, which rests upon its upper sur- face ; and its more highly vascular free borders, projecting into the lateral ventricles, form the choroid plexuses. The choroid plexuses (fig. 382, 2) appear like two knotted fringes reaching from the foramen of Monro, where they meet together beneath N N 2

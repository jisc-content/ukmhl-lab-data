235 COMPOUND SECRETING GLANDS. these into larger again, till they eventually terminate in one or more principal excretory ducts (m), by which the secretion is poured out of Fig. 162. Pig. 162.â€”Plans of Extension of Secreting Membrane, by Inversion or Recession. A, simple glands, viz., g, straight tube ; 7i, sac ; i, coiled tube. B, multilocular crypts ; Tc, of tubular form ; I, saccular. C, racemose, or saccular compound gland ; m, entire gland, stowing branched duct and lobular structure ; n, a lobule, detached with o, branch of duct proceeding from it. D, compound tubular gland. the gland. It is from the clustered arrangement of their ultimate vesicular recesses that these glands are named " racemose " (in German " traubenformige Drlisen "); and they, for the most part, have a dis- tinctly lobular structure. The lobules are held together by the branches of the duct to which they are appended, and by interlobular connective tissue which also supports the blood-vessels in their ramifications. The larger lobules are made up of smaller ones, these of still smaller, and so on for several successions. The smallest lobules (n) consist of two or three groups of saccules, with a like number of ducts, joining into an immediately larger ramuscule (o), which issues from the lobule; and

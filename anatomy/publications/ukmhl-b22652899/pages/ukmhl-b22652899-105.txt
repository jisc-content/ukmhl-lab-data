85 OF THE WRIST AND HAND. small; in one of them, the spider-monkey, it has disappeared, and the four fingers are suf- ficient, with hardly the rudiments of a thumb. In some of the tardigrade animals, as we have seen (in page 26) there are only three metacarpal bones with three fingers. In the horse, the can- non bone may be shewn to consist of two meta- carpal bones. Indeed, we might go further and instance the wing of the bird. To me, this appears to be losing the sense in the love of system. There is no regular gradation, but a variety most curiously adapting, as I have often to repeat, the same system of parts to every necessary purpose. In a comparative view of these bones, we are led more particularly to take notice of the foot of the horse. It is universally admitted to be of beautiful design, and calculated for strength and elasticity, and especially provided against con- cussion. The bones of the fore-leg of the horse become firmer as we trace them downwards. The two bones corresponding with those of the fore-arm, are braced together and consolidated; and the motion at the elbow joint is limited to flexion and extension. The carpus, forming what by a sort of license is called the knee, is also new modelled; but the metacarpal bones and phalanges of the toes are totally changed, and can hardly be recognised. When we look in front, instead of

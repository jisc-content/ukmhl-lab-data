CONFORMS TO THE EXTREMITY. 19 Were we to limit our enquiry to the bones of the arm and hand in man, no doubt we shouhl soon discover their provisions for easy, varied, and powerful action; and conclude that nothing could be more perfectly suited to their purposes. But we must extend our views to comprehend a great deal more,—a greater design. By a skeleton, is understood the system of bones, which being internal, gives the charac- teristic form to the animal, and receives the action of the exterior muscles. This system belongs, however, only to one part of the animal kingdom, that higher division,—the animalia vertebrata,* which includes the whole chain of beings, from man to fishes. The function the most essential to life is respiration ; and the mode in which this is per- formed, that is to say, the manner in which the decarbonization of the blood is effected through its exposure to the atmosphere, produces a re- markable change in the whole frame-work of the animal body. Man, the mammalia, birds, reptiles, and fishes have much of the mechanism of respi- ration in common; and there is a resemblance through them all, in the texture of the bones, in the action of the muscles, and in the arrangement of the nerves. They all possess the vertebral column or spine ; and the existence of this column * See the Classification at the end of the volume,—also the first of the Additional Illustrations. c 2

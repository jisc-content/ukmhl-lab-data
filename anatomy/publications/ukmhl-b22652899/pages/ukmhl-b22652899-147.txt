127 SUBSTITUTES FOR THE HAND. fastens itself by an apparatus which is on the lower part of its body. The sucking fish, remora, has a simiUir provision on its back. It attaches itself to the surface of the shark and to whatever is afloat; and, of course, to the bottoms of ships. The ancients believed it capable of stopping a ship under sail, and Pliny, therefore, called it remora. We must admire the means by which these fishes retain their proper position in the water, without clinging by their fins or teeth, and while they are free for such efforts as may enable them* to seize their food. The apparatus by which they attach themselves resembles a boy's sucker: the organ being pressed against the surface to which the creature is to be fixed, the centre is drawn by muscles in the same manner that the sucker is drawn with the cord, and thus a vacuum is made. In the cuttle-fish we see a modification of this In the Mollusca and Zoophytes we find many instances of the animal holding on against the force of tide or current. The Actiniae fix themselves to rocks and shells; and some, as the sea carnation, hang suspended from the lower surface of projectino- rocks, resembling the calyx of a flower. By the elongation of their tentacula, they expand and blow out like a flower; but instead of petals, these are prehensile instruments by which they draw whatever food floats near them into their stomachs. The Byssus of the muscle is a set of filaments which retains the shell at anchor and prevents it drifting or rolling with the tide. These filaments are the secretion of a gland, and whilst they are fixed to the rock, the gland retains the hold at their other ends. Th shell of the oyster is itself cemented to the rock. e

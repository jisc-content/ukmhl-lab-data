101 MEGATHERIUM. the iMegatherium of Cuvier. Every observation which we are enabled to make on the extreme bones of the foot, on the scapula, and on the teeth, confirms the idea entertained by Cuvier, that it was a vegetable feeder ; and that its great strength was employed in flinging up the soil and digging for roots. Its strength seems to have been concentrated to its paws, corresponding with the provisions there for enormous nails or claws. I have heard it surmised that this animal may have sat upon its hinder extremities, and pulled down the branches of trees to feed upon. It is only its great size that can coun- tenance such an idea. We have not the hu- merus, which by its processes would have declared the classification and activity of its muscles : but we can estimate the height, breadth, and strength of the animal by the pelvis and enormous bones of the posterior extremity; while by the scapula and clavicle we can form a conception of the extent of motion of the anterior extremity, and the great power that it possessed. In short, by the osseous and mus- cular systems we perceive that the strength of the Megatherium was not so much in the body, certainly not in the jaws, but was directed rather to the extremities; and that it was given neither for rapidity of motion nor offence, but for digging. How little was it to be expected that an

292 COMPARISON OF THE EYE this " finder" the astronomer directs to the con- stellation, and moves from star to star until the one which he desires to examine is in the centre of the field: and it is by this means that he adjusts the larger telescope to his object. Is this not a correct illustration of the operation of the eye ? Is the eye not imperfectly exercised when it sees but one point: on the other hand, is it not in the full performance of its function when it moves from one object to another, judges of the degree and the direction of that motion, and thus enables us, by comparison, to form our judgment ? It has been stated by a most ingenious philo- sopher of our time, in opposing these views of the compound nature of the sense of vision, that the forms and relations of objects are known to us by the unassisted operation of the eye-ball itselfâ€”by the transmission of the rays throagh the humours of the eye, and by their eifect upon the retina; and he has also affirmed that we should know the position of objects even if the muscles of the eye were paralytic. But I hope that it has been under- stood, when I give so much importance to the motions of the eye, that I do not neglect the movements of the body, and, more especially, the motions of the hand : that, in truth, the measure of objects which we take through the eye, is in correspondence with the experience which we

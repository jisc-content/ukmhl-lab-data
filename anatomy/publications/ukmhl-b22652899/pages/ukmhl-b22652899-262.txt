Â»24'2 ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE minute size or low in the scale of arrangement, exhibit any neglect or imperfection. Even if they were more simple in structure, the admira- tion should be the greater: since they have all the functions in full operation which are neces- sary to life. We may perceive that a certain substance calculated to sustain the more strictly living part, and to give strength, may be traced through all living bodies. In the vegetable it is the woody fibre ; and there, sometimes, as if to mark the analogy, we may find silicious earth deposited instead of the phosphate and car- bonate of lime of the animal structure. In the lower animals we find membranes capable of secreting a solid material, and although in some instances the substance is like leather or carti- lage, it is in general earthy, and for the most part, carbonate of lime. But when elasticity is neces- sary, as well as general resistance, cartilage is employed, which is a highly compressible and elastic substance. Thus, fishes have a large proportion of cartilage in their bones ; and from this greater quantity, some have been called cartilaginous in distinction to the osseous or true fishes. The cartilaginous and elastic skeleton comes into use in an unexpected manner in the fish: when the salmon or trout leaps from the water, the muscles bend the elastic spine ; this recoils in aid of the muscles of the oppo-

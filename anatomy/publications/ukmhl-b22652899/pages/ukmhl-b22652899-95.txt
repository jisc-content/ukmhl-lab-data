75 STRUCTURE OF BIRDS. and the length and pliability of the neck, whilst they give to the bill the office of a hand, become a substitution for the loss of motion in the body, by balancing the whole, as in standing, running, or flvino'. Is it not curious to observe how the whole skeleton is adapted to this one object, the power of the wings. Whilst the ostrich has no keel in its breast- bone, birds of passage are, on dissection, recog- nisable by the depth of this ridge of the sternum. The reason is that the angle, formed by this pro- cess and the body of the bone, affords lodgment for the pectoral muscle, the powerful muscle of the wing. In this sketch of the dissection of the swallow, there is a curious resemblance to the human arm, and we cannot fail to observe that the pectoral muscle constitutes the greater part of the bulk of the body.* And here we see the correspondence between the strength of this muscle and the rate of flying of the swallow, which is a mile in a minute, for ten hours every day, or six hundred miles a day.f If it be true that birds, when migrating, require a wind that blows against them, it implies an extraordinary * Borelli makes the pectoral muscles of a bird exceed in weight all the other muscles taken together; whilst the pectoral muscles of man are but a seventieth part of the whole mass of the muscles. t Mr. White says truly, that the swift lives on the wing ; it eats, drinks, and collects materials for its nest in flying, and never rests but during darkness.

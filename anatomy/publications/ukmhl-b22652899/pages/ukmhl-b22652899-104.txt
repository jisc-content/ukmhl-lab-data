If he should find the lower extremity of this same bone, and observe on it spines and grooves for distinct tendons which disperse to the phalanges, instead of running to be inserted into a single bone, he would conclude that there must have been moveable claws ■—that it be- longed to a carnivorous animal; and he would seek for canine teeth of corresponding size. THE LAST DIVISION OF THE BONES OF THE ARM. In the human hand, the bones of the wrist (carpus) are eight in number; and they are so closely connected that they form a sort of ball, which moves on the end of the radius. Beyond these, and towards the fingers, forming the palm of the hand, are the metacarpal bones, which diverge at their further extremities, and give support to the bones of the fingers. The thumb has no metacarpal bone, and is directly articu- lated with the carpus or wrist. There are thus in the hand twenty-nine bones, from the mecha- nism of which result strength, mobility and elasticity. Lovers of system (I do not use the term disparagingly) delight to trace the gradual sub- traction of the bones of the hand. Thus, look- ing to the hand of man, they see formed. In the simise they find it exceedingly

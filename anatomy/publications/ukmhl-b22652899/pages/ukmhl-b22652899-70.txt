r)0 COMPARATIVE STRUCTURE OF bone, like the blade of a knife ; and the clavicle is that stronger portion of bone which is articu- lated with the breast bone; this leaves the fur- culum as a new part. Now I think that the furculum, or fork bone, which, in cai-ving, we detach after removing the wings of a fowl, cor- responds with the form and place of the clavicle ; and if we so consider it, we may then take the strong bone commonly called the clavicle, as a process of the irregularly formed scapula. How- ever this may be, what w e have to admire in birds, is the mode in which the bones are fashioned to strengthen the articulation of the shoulder, and to give extent of surface for the attachment of the muscles which move the wings. Another peculiarity in birds is, that there is not an alternate motion of the wings ; their ex- tremities, as we may continue to call them, move together in flying ; and, therefore it is that the clavicles are joined to form the furculum. OF THE SCAPULA. If we attend to the scapula, or shoulder-blade, we shall better understand the influence of the bones of the shoulder on the motions and speed of animals. The scapula is that flat triangular bone (see page 43), which lying on the ribs, and cush- ioned with muscles, shifts and revolves with each movement of the arm. The muscles converge from all sides towards it, from the head, spine, ribs, and breast bone. These acting in succession.

SUPERIORITY OF THE 124 the small vessels of the arm. This is assigning a cause which is miequal to the effect, and pre- senting, altogether, too confined a view of the subject: it is a participation in the common error of seeking in the mechanism the cause of phe- nomena which have a deeper source. For the conveniences of life, and to make us prompt and dexterous, it is pretty evident that there ought to be no hesitation which hand is to be used, or which foot is to be put forward ; nor is there, in fact, any such indecision. Is this taught, or have we this readiness given to us by nature ? It must be observed, at the same time, that there is a distinction in the whole right side of the body, and that the left side is not only the weaker, in regard to muscular strength, but also in its vital or constitutional properties. The de- velopement of the organs of action and motion is greatest upon the right side, as may at any time be ascertained by measurement, or the ,testimony of the tailor or shoemaker ; certainly, this superiority may be said to result from the more frequent exertion of the right hand ; but the peculiarity extends to the constitution also ; and disease attacks the left extremities more fre- quently than the right. In opera dancers, we may see that the most difficult feats are per- formed by the right foot. But their preparatory exercises better evince the natural weakness of the left limb, since these performers are made to give double practice to this limb, in order to avoid

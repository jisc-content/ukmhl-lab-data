HORSE S SHOULDER. o3 stand the shock from the descent of the whole weight thrown forwards ; even though they were as powerful as the posterior extremities, they would suffer fracture or dislocation. We cannot but admire, therefore, the provision in all quadru- peds whose speed is great, and whose spring is extensive, that, from the structure of their bones, they have an elastic resistance, by which the shock of descending is diminished.

Were these bones connected together in a straight line, end to end, the shock of alighting would be conveyed through

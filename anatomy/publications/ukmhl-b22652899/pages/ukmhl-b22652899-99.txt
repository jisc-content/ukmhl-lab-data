OF THE RADIUS AND ULNA. 79 scapula, as when making the guards in fencing; but the easier and finer rolling of the wrist is accomplished by the motion of the radius on the ulna. The ulna has a hooked process, the olecranon, â€¢ which catches round the lower end of the humerus or arm bone, (this articulating portion is called trochlea), and forms with it a hinge joint. The radius, again, at the elbow, has a small, neat, round head, which is bound to the ulna by liga- ments, as a spindle is held in the bush. This bone turns on its axis, rolling upon the ulna both at the elbow and wrist-joint, and, as it turns, carries the hand with it, because the hand is strictly attached to its lower head alone. This rolling, is what is termed pronation and supination. Such a motion would be useless, and a source of weakness in an animal that had a solid hoof Accordingly, in the horse, these bones are united together, and consolidated in the position of pronation. But let us extend our views before we take the particular instance. There is indeed some- thing so highly interesting in the conformation of the whole skeleton of an animal, and the adaptation of any one part to all the other parts, that we must not let our reader remain ignorant of the facts, or of the important conclusions drawn from them. What we have to state has been the result of the studies of many

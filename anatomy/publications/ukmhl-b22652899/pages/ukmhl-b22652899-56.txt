As in the present day every creature has its natural enemy; or is checked in production, sometimes by a limited supply of food, some- times by disease, or by the influence of seasons ; and as in the whole a balance is preserved, we may reasonably apply the same principle in explanation of the condition of things as they existed in the earlier stages of the world's pro- gress ; certainly, this view is borne out, by what we have as yet discovered in the grouping of animals, in the different stratifications or deposits of the earth. If the Naturalist or Geologist, exploring the rocks of secondary formation, should find animals of the class MoUusca inclosed within them, it agrees with his preconceived notions, that only animals of their simple structure were in ex- istence at the time of the subsidence of that matter of which the rock consists. But if the spine of a fish, or a jawbone, or a tooth, be discovered, he is much disturbed; because, here is the indication of an animal having been at that time formed on a different type,—on that plan which belongs to animals of a superior elass.—Whereas on the supposition that animals are created with that relation to circumstances which we have just alluded to, it would only

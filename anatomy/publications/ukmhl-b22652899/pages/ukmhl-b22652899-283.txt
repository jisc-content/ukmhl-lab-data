AND IN THE EXTREMITIES. 203 strument like a hand in the proboscis-to nii- nister to the mouth, to grasp the herbage and hit it to its lips. Thus we perceive that the form oi the elephant, as far as regards the peculiar cha- racter in the shoulders and head, the closeness of the head to the body, the possession of the proboscis, and the defence of that proboscis by the projecting tusks, is a necessary consequence of the weight of the head and, indeed, of the great size of the animal. We may carry the enquiry a little further to the effect of elucidating a very curious part of natural history. The mastodon is the name of an extinct animal, which must have been nearly of the same size as the elephant. It has re- ceived that name from the early familiarity of Naturalists with the teeth; which have upon their surfaces of contact, mammillary-shaped pro- jections : and it was supposed, at one time, that they might have belonged to a carnivorous animal. But on a portion of the upper jaw being found with the teeth, it admitted of this course of reasoning. 1. In the upper maxillary bone of all vertebrated animals, there is a hole which transmits a branch of the fifth pair of nerves (see p. 132). This nerve goes to the upper lip. But when, as in the elephant, there is the addition of a great proboscis, since that organ possesses sensibility through this nerve, the nerve will be proportionably large, and the hole,

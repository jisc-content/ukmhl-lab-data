27o A COMPARISON OF THE EYE WITH THE HAND. If we are in search of an object which shall excite the highest interest, and at the same time afford proofs of design, we naturally turn to the eye as the most delicate of all the organs of the body: and this suits our present purpose the better, that we have to show how much of the sense of vision depends on the hand, and how strict the analogy is between these two â–  organs. From the time of Sir Henry Wotton to the latest writer on light, the eye has been a subject of admiration and eulogy. But I have ventured, cin a former occasion,* to say, that this admira- tion is misplaced, while it is given to the ball of the eye and the optic nerve exclusively ; since the high endowments of this organ belong to the exercise of the whole eye, to its exterior appa- ratus, as much as to its humours and the proper nerve of vision. It is to the muscular apparatus, and to the conclusions which we are enabled to draw from* the consciousness of muscular effort, * See Philosophical Transactions. T 2

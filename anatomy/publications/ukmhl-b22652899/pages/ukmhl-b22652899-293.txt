AND IN THK EXTREMITIES. by an exterior pouch, formed of the skin, until from minute and shapeless things, they are ma- tured to the degree in which the young of other animals are usually brought forth. Now we think that the upright position of this animal (for it is the only creature except man which rests in the perpendicular), and the dis- proportioned magnitude of the lower part of its body, are the reasons of the peculiarity in its mode of gestation. Without entering far into this subject, we may observe that there must be an accurate correspondence between the form of the young offspring and the bones of the mother through which it must be expelled. The head and anterior part of the young animal must be large: but in the kangaroo, the anterior part bears no proportion to the magnitude of the parts behind. Again, the bones called pelvis are ne- cessarily formed to sustain the viscera, if the animal be provided for the perpendicular po- sition ; and this is the case with the kangaroo. Nature has, therefore, accomplished the produc- tion of the young safely and by the simplest means,â€”that of anticipating the period of the separation of the young animal, and providing for its growth exteriorly, after it has passed through the circle of bones called the pelvis. For these reasons we conclude that there is a relation between the mode of producing the offspring and the form of the skeleton. T

THE EXTENT OF THE SYSTEM. ^'i the original earthy matter, and in this state it is as permanent as the soUd rock. It retains the form, though not the internal structure of bone; and that form, in consequence of the perfect system which we have hinted at, becomes a proof of revolutions the most extraordinary. The mind of the enquirer is carried back, not merely to the contemplation of animal structure, but by inference, from the system of animal organiza- tion to tlie structure of the globe itself. The bones of large animals and in great variety are found imbedded in the surface of the earth. They are discovered in the beds of rivers, they are found where no waters flow, they are dug up from under the solid limestone rock. The bones thus exposed, become naturally a subject of in- tense interest, and are unexpectedly connected with the enquiry in which we are engaged. Among other important conclusions they lead to thisâ€”that there is not only a scheme or system of animal structure pervading all the classes of animals which inhabit the earth, but that the principle of this great plan of creation was in operation, and governed the formation of those animals which existed previous to the revolu- tions that the earth itself has undergone: that the excellence of form now seen in the skeleton of man, was in the scheme of animal existence long previous to the formation of man, and before the surface of the earth was prepared

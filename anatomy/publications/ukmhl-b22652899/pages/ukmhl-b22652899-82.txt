&2 COMPARATIVE ANATOMY under the old denominations, or such as are appli- cable to their condition in the higher animals. In fishes, where the apparatus of respiration has undergone another entire change, and Avhere there are no proper ribs, the bones which give attachment to the pectoral fin, are still called the bones of the shoulder ; and that which is named scapular appendage, is, in fact, attached to the bones of the head. So that the whole consists of a circle of bones, which, we may say, seek se- curity of attachment by approacJiing the more solid part of the head, in defect of a firm foun- dation in the thorax. Thus the bones which, in a manner, give a foundation to those of the anterior extremity, have been submitted to a new modelling in cor- respondence with every variety in the apparatus of respiration ; and they have yet maintained their pristine office. The naturalist will not be surprised on finding an extraordinary intricacy in the shoulder ap- paratus of the ornithorynchus paradoxus, since the whole frame and organs of this animal imply that it is intermediate between mammalia and birds; it is placed in the list of edentata. We introduce it here as another instance of the changes which the bones of the shoulder undergo with every new office, and in correspondence with the motions of the extremity ; whether it be to support the weight in running, or to give freedom to the arm, or to provide for flying, or

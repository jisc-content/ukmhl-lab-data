OF THE MUSCULAR SENSE. 197 " an impression upon us, but likewise of what " resists our impulsions." The mistake here lies in giving to the nerves of touch a property which must belong to the actions of muscles. So it is affirmed by physiologists, as I have already had occasion to state, that the sense of touch differs from the other senses by this cir- cumstanceâ€”that an effort is propagated towards it, as well as a sensation received from it. This confusion obviously arises from considering the muscular agency, which is directed by the will during the exercise of touch, as belonging to the nerve of touch properly. We proceed to show how the sense of motion and that of touch are necessarily combined. When a blind man, or a man with his eyes shut, stands upright, neither leaning upon, nor touching aught; by what means is it that he maintains the erect position ? The symmetry of his body is not the cause. The statue of the finest proportion must be soldered to its pedestal, or the wind will cast it down. How^ is it, then, that a man sustains the perpendicular posture, or inclines in due degree towards the winds that blow upon him ? It is obvious that he has a sense by w hich he knows the inclination of his body, and that he has a ready aptitude to adjust it, and to correct any deviation from the perpen- dicular. What sense then is this? for he touches nothing, and sees nothing; there is no organ of sense hitherto observed which can serve him,

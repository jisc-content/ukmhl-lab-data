The head is balanced by it as on a steel-yard. With this circumstance in our mind, let us ob- serve the peculiar form of the elephant. 1. We begin, again, as in treating of the boar, by observing the teeth. We find that one of the grinders of the elephant weighs seventeen pounds ;i and of these there are four in the skull, besides the rudiments of others. 2. We next observe how admirably these grinding teeth are suited to sustain great pressure and attrition. 3. The jaws must be provided to give deep socketing to such teeth: and they must have space and strength to give lodg- ment and attachment to muscles sufficient for moving this grinding machine. 4. Tlie animal must have its defence too. Now each of the tusks sometimes weighs as much as one Imndred and thirteen pounds : and being pro- jected, they may be considered as if placed at the end of a lever. 5.

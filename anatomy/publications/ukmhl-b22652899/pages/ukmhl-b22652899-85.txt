OF THE BONES OF THE SHOULDER. 65 had they possessed the lungs of warm blooded animals, which are compressible only in a slight degree, their capacity of remaining under water would have left them struggling against their buoyancy, like a man, or any of the mammalia, when diving. The girdle of bones of the shoulder is constituted with a certain regard to the peculiar action of respiration, and to the pliancy of the body, in order that the vesicuhir lungs may be compressed, and the specific weight diminished. The facility which the absence of ribs gives, in the batrachian order, for admitting the compression of the lungs extended through the abdomen, and the extreme weakness and pliancy of these bones in the sau- rians, must be, as I apprehend, peculiarities adapted to the same end. OF THE HUMERUS, OR ARM BONE. The demonstration of this bone need not be so dry a matter of detail as the anatomist makes it. We may see in its form that curious relation of parts which has been so successfully employed by Paley to prove design, and from which the genius of Baron Cuvier has brought out some of the finest examples of inductive reasoning. In looking to the head of this bone in the human skeleton, (see the fig. page 43,) we observe the great hemispherical surface for F

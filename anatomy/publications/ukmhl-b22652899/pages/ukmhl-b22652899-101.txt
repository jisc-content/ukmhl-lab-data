The motions of the extremities imply a con- dition of the spine which unites them. Each bone of the spine will have that form which permits the bounding of the stag, or the gallop- ing of the horse, but it will not have that manner of joining which admits of the turning or writhing of the spine, as in the leopard or the tiger. And now he comes to the head:—the teeth of a carnivorous animal, he says, would be useless to rend prey, unless there were claws to hold it, and a mobility of the extremities like that of the hand, to grasp it. He considers, therefore, that the front teeth must have been for brousing, and the back teeth for grinding. The socketing of the teeth in the jaws gives a pe- culiar form to these bones, and the muscles which * For these are solid bones, where it is difficult to recognise any resemblance to the carpus, metacarpus and bones of the fin- gers ; and yet comparative anatomy proves that the latter bones are of the same class with those in the soliduuirula.

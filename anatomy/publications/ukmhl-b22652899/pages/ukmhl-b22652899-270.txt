ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE 250 exposed, it will die. Here, then, is an obvious imperfection. The bones of animals cannot, in this manner, be made capable of sustaining great weight, without losing a property which is neces- sary to their existence—that of restoration on their being injured. And even were the mate- rial very much condensed, it does not appear that the phosphate of lime, united as it is with the animal matter, is capable of sustaining any great weight. This accordingly limits the size of animals. It may, perhaps, countenance the belief that animals, in their size and duration of life, bear a relation to the powers and life of man—that the larger animals have existed in a former condition of the world. We allude only to such animals as have extremities : for with respect to the whale, its huge bulk lies out supported in the water. The iguanadon, dis- covered by Mr. Mantell, is estimated to have been seventy feet in length, and to have had ex- tremities. But the thigh and leg did not exceed eight feet in length, while the foot extended to six feet; a proportion, altogether, which implies that the extremities assisted the animal to crawl, rather than that they were capable of be aring its weight, as the extremities of the mammalia. However, we find that in the larger terrestrial animals, the material of the bones is dense, and that their cavities are filled up : the diameters of those of the extremities, with their spines and

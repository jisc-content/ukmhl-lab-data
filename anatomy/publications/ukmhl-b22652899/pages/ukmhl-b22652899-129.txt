PECULIARITIES IN THE HAND. 109 rably combined. Nothing is more remarkable, as forming a part of the prospective design to prepare an instrument fitted for the various uses of the human hand, than the manner in which the dehcate and moving apparatus of the- palm and fingers is guarded. The power with which the hand grasps, as when a sailor lays hold of the rope to raise his body in the rigging, would be too great for the texture of mere tendons, nerves, and vessels; they would be crushed, were not every part that bears the pressure, defended with a cushion of fat, as elastic as that which we have described in the foot of the horse and the camel. To add to this purely passive defence, there is a muscle which runs across the palm and more especially supports the cushion on its inner edge. It is this muscle which, raising the edge of the palm, adapts it to lave water, forming the cup of Diogenes. In conclusion,—what says Ray,—" Some ani- " mals have horns, some have hoofs, some teeth, some talons, some claws, some spurs and " beaks : man Jiath none of all these, but is weak and feeble, and sent unarmed into the " world—Why, a hand, with reason to use it, " supplies the use of all these."

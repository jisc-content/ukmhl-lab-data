If the eye continue to look steadfastly upon one object, the image is soon lost—if we continue to look on one colour, we become insensible to that colour, and opposite colours to each other are necessary for a perfect impression. So have we seen that in the sensibilities of the skin variations are necessary to continued sensation. It is difficvdt to say what these philosophers would define as pleasure : but whatever exercise of the senses it should be, unless we are to sup- pose an entire change of our nature, its opposite is also implied. Nay, further, in this fan- ciful condition of existence, did anything of our present nature prevail, emotions purely of pleasure would lead to indolence, relaxation, and indifference.

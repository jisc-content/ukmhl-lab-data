64 COMPARATIVE ANATOMY arches, constituting the thorax, are more perfect than in the chelonian and batrachian orders; and the bones of the shoulder are therefore exter- nal, and resemble those of the crocodile ; yet the ribs are so weak as to be incapable of sustaining the powerful action of the muscles of the anterior extremities ; accordingly, the bones, which by a kind of license we continue to call clavicle, omo- plate or scapula, and coracoid, though strangely deviating from the original form and connections, constitute a texture of considerable strength, which perfects the anterior part of the trunk, and gives attachment and lodgement to the powerful muscles of the paddle. But in giving their attention to this subject, it does not appear that naturalists have hit upon the right explanation of the peculiar structure, and curious varieties of these bones. Why is the apparatus of respiration so totally changed in these classes of animals? They are cold blooded animals ; they require to respire less frequently than other creatures, and they remain long under the water. I conceive that the peculiarity in their mode of respiration cor- responds with this property. Hence their ve- sicular lungs, their mode of swallowing the air, instead of inhaling it ; and hence, especially, their power of compressing the body and ex- pelling the air. It is this, I imagine, which enables them to go under the water and crawl upon the bottom ; without this, that is to say.

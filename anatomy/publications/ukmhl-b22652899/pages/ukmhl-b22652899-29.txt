INTRODtCTORV CHAPTER. ^ should present these things to us anew, with this dilierence, that the mind may contemphite them : that mind which is now strengthened by experi- ence to compreliend them, and to entertain a grateful sense of them. It is this sense of gratitude whiqh distinguishes man. In brutes, the attachment to offspring for a limited period is as strong as in him, but it ceases with the necessity for it. In man, on the contrary the affections continue, become the sources of all the endearing relations of life, and the very bonds by which society is connected. If the child, upon the parent's knee, is imcon- sciously incurring a debt, and strong affections grow up so naturally that nothing is more univer- sally condemned than lilial ingratitude, we have but to change the object of affection, to find the ; natural source of religion itself. We must show ' that the care of the most tender parent is in nothing to be compared with those provisions for our enjoyment and safety, which it is not only beyond the ingenuity of man to provide, but Avhich he can hardly comprehend, while he profits by them. If man, of all living creatures, be alone capable of gratitude, and through this sense be capable also of religion, the transition is natural; since the gratitude due to parents is abundantly more owing to Him " who saw him in his blood, and " said, Live."

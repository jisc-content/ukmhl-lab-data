121 THROUGH THE MUSCLES. This example is sufficient to show how accurately the comparative anatomy of the muscles con- forms to that of the bones; and that in propor- tion as the bones of the extremity resemble in shape and power of motion those of the human arm, so do the muscles—another proof of the great extent of the system of relations estab- lished in the animal system. There is one circumstance more which should not be omitted in the comparative anatomy of these muscles, as it exhibits another instance of conformity in their structure, to the offices which they have to perform. We have just stated that the power of contraction is a vital property. The continued action of a muscle, therefore, exhausts the vitality ; and to support that action, when it is inordinate, there must be a more than usual provision for the supply of this living power, viz:—a means of increasing or maintaining the circulation of the blood, which is the source of all vital power. In the lor is tardigradus* it has been observed that the axillary and femoral arteries, the great arteries of the anterior and posterior extremi- ties, have this peculiarity—that the main vessel is sub-divided into a number of equal-sized cylinders, which again unite to form a single trunk previous to the distribution of its branches * See the Appendix, Division I. Qiiadrumana.

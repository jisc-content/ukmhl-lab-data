ANATOMY OF THE 54 a solid column, and the bones of the foot, or the joints, would suffer from the concussion. When the rider is thrown forwards on his hands, and more certainly when he is pitched on his shoulder, the collar bone is broken, because in man, this bone forms a link of connection between the shoulder and the trunk, so as to receive the whole shock; and the same would happen in the horse, the stag, and all quadrupeds of great strength and swiftness, were not the scapulae sustained by muscles, and not by bone, and did not the bones recoil and fold up. The horse-jockey runs his hand down the horse's neck, in a knowing way, and says, " this horse has got a heavy shoulder, he is a slow horse!" He is right, but he does not under- stand the matter; it is not possible that the shoulder can be too much loaded with muscle, for muscle is the source of motion, and bestows power. What the jockey feels, and forms his judgment on, is the abrupt transition from the neck to the shoulder, which, in a horse for the turf, ought to be a smooth undulating surface. This abruptness, or prominence of the shoulder, is a consequence of the upright position of the scapula; the sloping and light shoulder results from its obliquity. An upright shoulder is the mark of a stumbling horse: it does not revolve easily, to throw forward the foot. Much of the strength, if not the freedom and rapidity of motion, of a limb, will depend on the

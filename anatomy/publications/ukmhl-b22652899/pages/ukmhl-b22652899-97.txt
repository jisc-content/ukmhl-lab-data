FOR FLYING. 77 tration, for although the phalanges of the fingers are not here used to extend the web, the ribs, which are unnecessary for breathing, are pro- longed like the whale-bone of an umbrella, and on them the skin is expanded. But this brings us to a very curious subject,â€” the condition of those Saurian reptiles, the re- mains of which are found only in a fossil state, in what are termed the ancient strata of the Jura. The Pterodactyle of Cuvier is an animal which seems to confound all our notions of system. Its mouth was like the long bill of a bird, and its flexible neck corresponded ; but it had teeth in its jaws like those of a crocodile. It had the bones of the anterior extremity pro- longed, and fashioned somewhat like those in the wing of a bird ; but it could not have had feathers, as it had not a proper bill. We see no creature having feathers without a bill to dress and prin them. Nor did this extremity resemble in its structure that of a bat: instead of the pha- langes being equally prolonged, the second finger only was extended to an extraordinary length, whilst the third, fourth, and fifth remained with the length and articulation of those of a quad- ruped, and with sharp nails, corresponding with the pointed teeth. The extended metacarpal bone and phalanges reached double the whole length of the animal, and the conjecture is, that there was extended upon them a membrane resembling that of the Draco fimbriatus.

OF THE SHOULDER. 45 erect posture, or only for a moment; but for swinging, or for a vigorous pull, whÂ© can deny him power in those long and sinewy arms. The full prominent shoulders, and the conse- quent squareness of the trunk, are equally dis- tinctive of man, with the strength of his loins ; they indicate a free motion of the hand. OF THE BONES OF THE SHOULDER. The bones of the shoulder, being those which give firm attachment to the upper extremity, and which afford origins to the muscles of the arm and fore arm, are simple, if studied in man, or, indeed, in any one genus of animals; but considered in reference to the whole of the vertebral animals, they assume a very extraordinary degree of intri- cacy. We shall, however, find that they retain their proper office, notwithstanding the strange variations in the form of the neighbouring parts. In man they are directly connected with the great apparatus of respiration ; but in other ani- mals we shall see the ribs, as it were, withdrawn, and the bones of the shoulder, or fundamental bones of the extremity, curiously and mechani- cally adapted to perform their office without the support of the thorax. We shall not, however, anticipate the difficulties of this subject, but look first upon that which is most familiar and easy, the shoulder of man in comparison with the varieties in the mammalia.

COMl'AKED WITH THE DEEPER PARTS. 157 are actually sensible to concussion, to stretching, or laceration. How consistent, then, and beautiful is the distribution of this quality of life! The sensi- bility to pain varies with the function of the part. The skin is endowed with sensibility to every possible injurious impression which may be made upon it. But had this kind and degree of sensibility been made universal, we slioidd have been racked with pain in the common motions of the body: the mere weioht of one part on another, or the motion of the joint, would have been attended with that degree of suffering which we experience in using or walking upon an inflamed limb. But on the other hand, had the deeper parts possessed no sensibility, we should have had no guide in our exertions.

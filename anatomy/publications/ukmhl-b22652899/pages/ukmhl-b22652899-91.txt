It is particularly pleasing to notice here the correspondence between the humerus and the other bones,â€”the scapula large and with a double spine, and great processes: the ulna projecting at the ole- cranon, and the radius freely rotating: but above all, in the developement of one grand metacarpal bone, and its corresponding phalanges, which give attachment to a strong claw, we see a very distinct provision for scratching and turning aside the ant-hill.

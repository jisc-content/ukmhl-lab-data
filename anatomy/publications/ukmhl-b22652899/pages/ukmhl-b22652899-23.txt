Let us for a moment think what is the natural result of examining the human body as a piece of machinery, and let us see whether it makes the creation of man more or less important in his relation to the whole scheme of nature. Suppose that there is placed before us a ma^ chine for raising great weights, be it the simplest of all, the wheel and axle. We are given to under- stand that this piece of mechanism has the pro- perty of multiplying the power of the hand. But a youth of subtile mind may say, I do not believe that it is possible so to multiply the power of the hand; and if the mechanician be a philosopher, he will rather applaud the spirit of doubt. If he conde- scend to explain, he will say, that the piles driven into the ground, or the screws which unite the machinery to the beams, are the fixed points which resist in the working of the machine ; that their resistance is a necessary condition, since it is thrown, together with the power of the hand, on the weight to be raised ; and he will add that the multiplication of wheels does not alter the principle of action, which every one may see in the simple lever, to result from the resistance of the fulcrum or point, on which it rests. Now grant that man's body is a machine, where are the points of resistance ? are they not in the ground he stands upon ? This leads us to enquire

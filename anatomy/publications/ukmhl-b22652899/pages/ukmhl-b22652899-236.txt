216 THE SUBJECT ILLUSTRATED. for all this is not visible in the organs of the voice, as they are called : it is to be found in the nerves which combine all these various parts in one simultaneous act. The meshes of the spider's web, or the cordage of a man-of-war^ are few and simple compared with the concealed filaments of nerves which move these parts; and if but one be wanting, or its tone or action disturbed in the slightest degree, every body knows how a man will stand with his mouth open, twisting his tongue and lips in vain attempts to utter a word. It will now appear that there must be distinct lines of association suited to the organs of voice —different to combine them in the bark of a dog, in the neighing of a horse, or in the shrill whistle of the ape. That there are wide distinc- tions in the structure of the different classes of animals is most certain ; but independently of those which are apparent, there are secret and minute varieties in the associating cords. The ape, therefore, does not articulate—First, because the organs are not perfect to this end. Secondly, because the nerves do not associate these organs in that variety of action which is necessary to speech. And, lastly, were all the exterior ap- paratus perfect, there is no impulse to that act of speaking. Now I hope it appears, from this enumeration

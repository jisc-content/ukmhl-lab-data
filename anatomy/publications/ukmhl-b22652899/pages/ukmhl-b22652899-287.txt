AND IN THE EXTREMITIES. ^O/ of the former: it is cellular, and thin and light as a paper case. Can there he any thing more ohvious than that this is provided in conse- quence of the extraordinary length of the neck, or on the consideration (if we may use the expres- sion) that, if the skull of the giraffe had been as strong and heavy as that of the horse or camel, it would have preponderated too much at the extremity of such a neck. There is an accommodation also in the posi- tion of the spiue. In most quadrupeds the spine lies horizontally. If it had been so placed in the giraffe, the w hole weight of the shoulders, neck, and head w^ould have been thrown on the anterior extremities. But from the shortness of the hind legs and the oblique position of the trunk, the hind legs bear a portion of the weight of the neck and head, parts which, in other crea- tures, are sustained altogether by the fore legs.* When w e look to the ribs, we see another pecu- liarity that may be accounted for on the same con- sideration of the length and consequent weight of the neck and head. The chest or thorax rests, of course, upon the anterior extremities : and we shall find that those ribs which bear the pressure are of great comparative strength, while the ribs posterior to these are singularly * The ligamentum nuchae in this animal extends the whole length of the spine, from the os sacrum to the skull.

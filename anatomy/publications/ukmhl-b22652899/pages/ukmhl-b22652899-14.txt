PREFACE. X attended the author's lectures, and found him engaged in maintaining the principles of the English school of Physiology, and in ex- posing the futility of the opinions of those French philosophers and physiologists, who represented life as the mere physical result of certain combinations and actions of parts, by them termed Organization. That gentleman thought that the subject admitted of an argument which it became him to use, in his office of " Christian Advo- cate "* This will show the reader that the sentiments and the views, which a sense of duty to the young men about him induced the author to deliver, and which Mr. Rennell heard only by accident, arose naturally out of those studies. It was at the desire of the Lord Chancellor that the author wrote the essay on " Animal Mechanics;" and it was probably from a belief that the author felt the importance of the subjects touched upon in that essay, that his lordship was led to do him the further honour of asking him to join with him in illustrating the Natural Theology" of Dr. Paley. * An office ih the University of Cambridge.

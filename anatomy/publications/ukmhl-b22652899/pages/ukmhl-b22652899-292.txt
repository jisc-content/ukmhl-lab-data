27-2 VARIATIONS IN THE CENTRE the present, out of the question, the continuation of the species is tlie next in importance. Now a bird, to be buoyant and capable of flying, could not have been viviparous. If we have seen that a fidl stomach impeded the flight of a carnivorous bird, it is evident that it could not have carried its young within it. Is it not cu- riously provided, then, that the bird shall pro- duce its oftspring by a succession of small eggs, which shall accumulate in the nest, instead of growing in the body? In short, it requires no argument to prove that the hollow bones of the skeleton, the extension of the breast-bone, the air-cells, the quill-feathers, the bill, and the laying of eggs, are all in necessary relation to each other. Since we have spoken of the relation of the form of the skeleton to the continuation of the species, in the bird, we may for the same object revert to the quadrupeds. In all the mammalia, there is nothing more extraordinary than the deviation in the skeleton of the kangaroo from the general form. Joined to this, there is a remarkable peculiarity in the manner by which this animal produces its young. Instead of re- maining within the mother for the usual period of gestation, the young, by some peculiar mode not perfectly understood, are excluded from within the belly, and are found attached to the teats; where they hang by the mouth, covered

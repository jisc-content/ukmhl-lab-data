WITH THE HAND. 277 the phenomena of vision, and especially the ex- treme minuteness of the image cast upon the retina, I had conceived that the whole nerve was not the seat of vision, but only one or other of its surfaces. This could not be well illustrated until the exterior membrane of the retina was demonstrated. But now we see that this mem- brane, when floated in water and under a mag- nifying glass, is of extreme tenuity, and its smooth surface is well calculated to correspond with the exterior surface of that layer of nervous matter which is the seat of the sense. The term retina would imply that the nerve constitutes a network: and the expressions of some of our first modern authorities would induce us to believe that they view it in this light, as corresponding with their hypothesis. But there is no fibrous texture in the matter of the nerve ; although, when the retina is floated and torn with the point of a needle, the innermost of the membranes which support the nerve, the tunica vasculosa retincs, presents something of this ap- pearance. Vision is not excited by light unless the rays penetrate through the transparent retina and reach the exterior surface from within. It is well known, that if we press upon the eye-ball with a key or the end of a pencil-case, zones of light are excited. The perception of that light is, as if the rays came in a direction

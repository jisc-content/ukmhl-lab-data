The spec- tators in their theatres must have had very different associations from ours, to account for the national enthusiasm arising from music and their rage excited by a mere error in the time. This may remind us that the divisions in music in some degree belong to the muscular sense. A man will put down his staft' in regulated time, and the sound of his steps will fall into a mea- sure, in his common walk. A boy striking the railing in mere wantonness, will do it with a regular succession of blows.

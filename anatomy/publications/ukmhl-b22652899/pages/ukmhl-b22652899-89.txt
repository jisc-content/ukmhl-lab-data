OF THE BAT. 69 There can be no greater contrast to these bones than is presented in the skeleton of the bat. In that animal the bones are light and delicate; and whilst they are all marvellously extended, the phalanges of the fingers are elon- gated so as hardly to be recognised, obviously for the purpose of sustaining a membraneous web, and to form a wing. plough the earth with their snouts. We have noticed the manner in which they use their strong hands; we should add that their head is a wedge, to which their hands are assisting in throwing aside the earth. The conformation of the head in shape and strength of bones, and the new adjustment of a muscle, which is cutaneous in other animals (the Platisma Myoides) to the motions of the head, are among the most curious changes of common parts to new offices.

34 THEORY OF THK SUCCESSION OF and we shall be led to observe some very extra- ordinary changes, as we trace the same parts through different genera and species of animals. In doing this, we are naturally called upon to take notice of certain opinions which prevail on the subject. We have already hinted, that geologists have discovered, that in the stratified rocks there is proof of a regular succession of formations in the crust of the earth, and that animals of very different structure have been imbedded, and are preserved in them. In the earlier formed strata animals are found which are low, as we choose to express it, in the chain of existence ; in higher strata, oviparous animals of great bulk, and more complex structure, are discovered; above the strata containing these oviparous rep- tiles, there are found mammalia; and in the looser and more superficial stratum are the bones of the mastodon, megatherium, rhinoceros, and elephant, &c. We must add that geologists agree that man has been created last of all. Upon these facts, a theory is raised, that there has been a succession of animals gradually increasing in the perfection of their structure; that the first impulse of nature was not suf- ficient to the production of the highest and most perfect, and that it was only in her mature eflfbrts that mammalia were produced. We are led to this reflection: that the creation of a

In the text, in speaking of the upper or anterior extremity, it has been shown that the changes w^hich we see in the forms of different animals are referrible to one principleâ€”the adaptation of the parts to their proper uses. We may, in some measure, consider the head in animals as performing the office of hands : and if we take it in this view, we shall see how far it holds true that the centre of the skeleton remains perma- nent in its form compared with the variations in the extreme parts. It has been stated as the opinion of some naturalists that the varieties in the conformation of the skeleton are to be ac- counted for by a law w hich preserves the central parts permanent, whilst the extremities are inci- dent to change. I shall controvert that opinion, and show that the spine and head, whilst they retain their offices of protecting the brain and spinal marrow, and are permanent in regard to

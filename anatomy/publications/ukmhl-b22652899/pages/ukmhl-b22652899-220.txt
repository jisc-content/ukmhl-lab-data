'200 OF THE MUSCULAR SENSE with the change of posture of the body. These are additional proofs of a muscular sense ; that there is an internal sensibility corresponding with the changing condition of the muscles; and that as the sensations of an organ of sense remain after the destruction of the outward organ, so here a deceptious sensibility to the condition of the muscles, as well as to the con- dition of the skhi, is felt after the removal of the limb. By such arguments I have been in the habit of showing that we possess a muscular sense, and that without it we could have no guidance of the frame. We could not command our muscles in standing, far less in w^alking, leaping, or running, had we not a perception of the con- dition of the muscles previous to the exercise of the will. And as for the hand, it is not more the freedom of its action which constitutes its perfection, than the knowledge which we have of these motions, and our consequent ability to direct it with the utmost precision. The necessity for the combination of two distinct properties of the nervous system in the sense of touch becomes more obvious if we examine their operation in another but ana- logous organ; for example, in the palpa or tentacula of the lower animals. These animals use those instruments to grope their way : and

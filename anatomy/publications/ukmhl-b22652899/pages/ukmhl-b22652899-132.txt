112 OF THE MUSCLES OF of a limb implies an active state or a change in both classes of muscles, the one to contract, the other to relax; and the will influences both classes. Were it not so regulated, instead of the natural, easy, and elegant motions of the frame, the attempt at action would exhibit the body convulsed, or, as the physicians term it, in clonic spasms. The similitude of the two sawyers, mentioned by Paley, gives but an im- perfect idea of the adjustment of the two classes of muscles. When two men are sawing a log of wood, they pull alternately, and when the one is pulling, the other resigns all exertion. But this is not the condition of the musclesâ€”the relaxing muscle has not given up all effort, like a loose rope, but is controlled in its yielding, with as fine a sense or adjustment, as is the action of the contracting muscles. Nothing appears to us more simple than raising the arm, or pointing with the finger; yet in that single act, not only are innumerable muscles put into activity, but as many are thrown out of action, and the condition of these classes is totally opposite to each other, under the same act of volition. By such considerations, we are prepared to admire the faculty which shall combine a hun- dred muscles so as to produce a change of pos- ture or action of the body ; and we now perceive that the power taken from one class of our muscles, may be considered as if it were bestowed on the

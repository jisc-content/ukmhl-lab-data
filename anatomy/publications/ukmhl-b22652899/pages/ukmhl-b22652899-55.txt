ANIMALS FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX. 35 living animal, the bestowing of life on a corporeal frame, however simple the structure of that body, is of itself an act of creative power so inconceiv- ably great, that we can have no title to presume that any change in the organization, such as the provision of bones and muscles, or the production of new organs of sense, is a higher effort of that power. We have a better guide in exploring the varieties of animated nature, when we acknow- ledge the manifest design with which all is ac- complished ; the adaptation of the animals, their size, their economy, their organs, and instruments to their condition. Whether we make the most superficial or most profound examination of animals in their natural state, we shall find that the varieties are so balanced as to ensure the existence of all. This, we think, goes far to explain, first, why the remains of certain animals are found in certain strata, which imply a peculiar con- dition of the earth's surface; and, secondly, why these animals are found grouped together. For, as we may express it, if there had been an error in the grouping, there must have been a destruction of the whole ; the balance necessary to their existence having been destroyed. We know very well that so minute a thing as a fly will produce millions, which, if not checked, will ere long darken the air and render whole regions desolate: so that if the breeze does D 2

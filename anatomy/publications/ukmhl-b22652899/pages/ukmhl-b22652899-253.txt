COiNCLUDlNG REMARKS. 233 advancement, as in a map, we are recalled to a nearer and more important consideration : for what to us avail all these proofs of divine power—of harmony in nature—of design—the predestined accommodation of the earth, and the creation of man's frame and faculties, if we are stopped here ?

On the contrary, reasons accu- mulate at every step, for a higher estimate of the living soul, and give us assurance that its condition is the final object and end of all this machinery, and of these successive revolutions. To this, must be referred the weakness of the frame, and its liability to injury, the helpless- ness of infancy, the infirmities of age, the pains, diseases, distresses, and afflictions of life—for by such means is man to be disciplined—his facul- ties and virtues unfolded, and his affections drawn to a spiritual Protector.

4 INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. by what property we stand. Is it by the weight of the body, or, in other words, is it by the attraction of the earth ? The terms attraction, or gravitation lead at once to the philosophy of the question. We stand because the body has weight, and a resistance, in proportion to the matter of the animal frame, and the magnitude of the globe itself. We wait not at present to observe the adjustment of the strength of the frame, the resistance of the bones, the elasticity of the joints, and the power of the muscles to the weight of the whole. Our attention is directed to the rela- tions which the frame has to the earth we are placed upon. Some philosophers, who have considered the matter curiously, have said, that if man were translated bodily to another planet, and were it smaller than the earth, he would be too light, and he would walk like one wading in deep water. If the planet were larger, the attraction of his body would make him feel as if his limbs were loaded with lead ; nay, the attraction might be so great as to destroy the fabric of the body, crushing bones and all.* However idle these fancies may be, there is no doubt that the animal frame is formed with a due relation to the earth we inhabit, and that the * The matter of Jupiter is as 330,600 to 1000 of our Earth. The diameter of Pallas is 80 miles; the Earth is 7,911 miles in diameter.

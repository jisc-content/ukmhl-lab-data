70 COMPARATIVE ANATOMY Contemplating this extraordinary application of the bones of the extremity, and comparing them with those in the wing of a bird, we might say, that this is an awkward attemptâ€”" a failure." But before giving expression to such an opinion, we must understand the objects re- quired in this construction. It is not a wing intended merely for flight, but one which, while it raises the animal, is capable of receiving a new sensation, or sensations in that exquisite decree so as almost to constitute a new sense. On the fine web of the bat's wing nerves are distributed, which enable it to avoid objects in its flight, during the obscurity of night, when both eyes and ears fail. Could the wing of a bird, covered with feathers, do this? Here then we have another example of the necessity of taking every circumstance into consideration before we presume to criticise the ways of nature. It is a lesson of humility.* In the next page we have a sketch of the arm bones of the Ant-eater,t to shew once more the correspondence that is maintained in the whole * Besides the adaptation of the bat for flight, through a new adjustment of the bones of the arm, this animal has cells under its skin; but I know not how far I am authorized to say that they are analogous to the air-cells of birds, or that they are for the purpose of making the bat specifically lighter. They extend over the breast, and under the axillse in some bats; and they are filled by an orifice which communicates with the pharynx. 1 Tamandua, from South America.

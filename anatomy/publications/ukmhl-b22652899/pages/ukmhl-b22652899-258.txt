It is twisted into ligaments, and knits the strongest bones: it is the medium between bone, muscle, and blood-vessel: it produces a certain firmness and union of the various component parts of the body while it admits of their easy motion. Without it, we should be rigid, not- withstanding the proper organs for motion ; and the cavities could not be distended or contracted, nor could the vessels pulsate. But this cellular texture is not sufficient on all occasions, either for giving strength or protec- tion : nor does it serve to sustain the weight, unless the animal lives suspended in water, or creeps upon the ground. We see, therefore, the necessity for some harder and more resisting material being added, if the weight is to rest on points or extremities; or if the muscular activity is to be concentrated. ' Nature has other means of supplying the fulcrum and lever, besides the bones, or true skeleton, which we have been examining in the first part of this volume: and perhaps we shall find that there may be a system of solid parts superior to what we have been studying in the vertehrata. The larvae of proper insects and the annelides have no exterior members for walking or flying : but to enable them to creep, they must have points of resistance, or their muscles would be

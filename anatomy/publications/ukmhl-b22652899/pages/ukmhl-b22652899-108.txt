OF THE horse's FOOT. 88 the bent condition of the joint, when the foot is elevated, and that then the bone must descend. If the splint bone be depressed when the limb is raised and bent, and have a power of recoiling (which it certainly has), it must aid in throwing out the leg into the straight position and assist the extensor muscles of the knee. Further, we can readily believe that when the elasticity of these splint bones is lost, by ossification uniting them firmly to the cannon bone, the want of such a piece of mechanism, essential to the quick ex- tension of the foot, will make the horse apt to come down. In looking to this sketch and comparing it with that of the hand on page 78, we see that in the horse's leg the five bones of the first digital phalanx are consolidated into the large pastern bone ; those of the second phalanx into the lesser pastern or coronet; and those of the last phalanx into the coffin bone. Of the horse's foot.â€”But the foot itself deserves our attention. The horse, a native of extensive plains and steppes, is perfect in his structure as adapted to these his natural pasture grounds. When brought, however, into subjec- tion, and running on our hard roads, his feet suffer from concussion. The value of the horse, so often impaired by lameness of the foot, has made that part an object of great interest; and I have it from the excellent professor of vete- rinary surgery to say that he has never demon-

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY 44 only are the lower limbs longer and larger than those of any other animal, but the pelvis is wider, and the obliquity of the neck of the thigh bone greater. The distances of the large processes on the upper ends of the thigh bones (the troch- anters,) from the sockets, are also greater than in any of the vertebrata. Altogether the strength of these bones, the size and prominence of their processes, the great mass of the muscles of the loins and hips, distinguish man from every other animal; they secure to him the upright posture, and give him the perfect freedom of the arms, for purposes of ingenuity and art. At the head of this chapter is a sketch of the Chimpanzee,* an ape which stands high in the order of quadrvmiana, yet we cannot mistake his capacities : that the lower extremities and pelvis, or hips, were never intended to give him the * Simia troglodytes, from the coast of Guinea, more human in its form, and more easily domesticated than the orang-outang. We would do well to consider the abode of these creatures in a state of natureâ€”vast forests, extending in impenetrable shade, below, whilst above, and exposed to the light, there is a scene of verdure and beauty; this is the home of those monkeys and lemurs which have extremities like hands. In many of them the hinder extremity has the more perfect resemblance to a hand; and in the Coaita (p. 17) we see the great toe as- suming the characters of a thumb, whilst in the fore paw the thumb is not distinguishable, being hid in the skin. In short, these paws are not approximations to the hand, corresponding with a higher ingenuity, but are adaptations of the feet, to the branches on which the animals climb and walk.

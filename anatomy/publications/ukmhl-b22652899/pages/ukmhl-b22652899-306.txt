COMPARISON OF THE EYE 28G Reverting to the sensible spot in the retina, it does not appear that we are authorised in terming it a spot. The same law governs vision when we look to a fine point of a needle, or to an object in an extensive landscape. We look to the point of a pen, and we can rest the attention on the point upon the one side of the slit, to the exclusion of the other, just as we can select and intently survey a house or a tree. If the sensible spot were regularly *' efficacy, it is necessary that the almost infinitely minute impulse " of the adjacent ethereal molecules should be often and regularly " repeated, so as to multiply and concentrate their effect. Thus, as " a great pendulum may be set in swing by a very minute force, " often applied at intervals exactly equal to its time of oscillation, " or as one elastic body can be set in vibration, by the vibration of *' another at a distance propagated through the air, if in exact " unison, even so we may conceive the gross fibres of the nerves of " the retina to be thrown into motion by the continual repetition of " the ethereal pulses: and such only will be thus agitated, as from "their size, shape, or elasticity, are susceptible of vibrating in " times exactly equal to those at which the impulses are repeated. " Thus it is easy to conceive how the limits of visible colour may " be established : for if there be no nervous fibres in unison with " vibrations more or less frequent than certain limits, such vibra- " tions, though they reach the retina, will produce no sensation. " Thus, too, a single impulse, or an irregularly repeated one, pro- " duces no light. And thus also may the vibrations excited in the " retina continue a sensible time after the exciting cause has " ceased, prolonging the sensation of light (especially if a vivid " one) for an instant in the eye in the manner described.''â€”Sir ,J. F. W. Herschel, Art. Light. Enc. Met. Now it does appear to me that this reasoning is inconsistent with the phenomena above noticed.

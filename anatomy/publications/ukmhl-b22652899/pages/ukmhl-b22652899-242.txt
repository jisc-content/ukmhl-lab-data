It has been made manifest that man and the animals inhabiting the earth have been created with reference to the magnitude of the globe; —that their living endowments bear a relation to their state of existence and to the elements around them. We have learnt that the system of animal bodies is simple and universal, not- withstanding the amazing diversity of forms that meet the eye—and that this system not only embraces all living creatures, but that it has been continued from periods of great anti- quity, before the last revolution of the earth's surface had been accomplished.

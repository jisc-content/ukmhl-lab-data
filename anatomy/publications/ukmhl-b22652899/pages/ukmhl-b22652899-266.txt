The bones of the extremities are called hollow cylinders. Now, after having convinced our- selves of the necessity of this formation, which combines strength with lightness, we may find, upon a more particular examination, that these bones are extremely varied in their shapes : and we are, at last, prone to believe that there is much of chance or irregularity in their forms. But such a conception is quite inconsistent with a correct knowledge of the skeleton. As this notion, however, is very commonly entertained and leads to further mistakes, we shall take pains to show,â€”first, why the bones are hollow cylinders ; and, in the second place, why they vary in their shape, so as to appear to the super- ficial observer irregular. The reasoning that applies to the hollow cylin- drical bone serves equally to explain the admi- rable structure of many other natural forms, as that of a quill, a reed, or a straw. The last example reminds us of the xmfortunate man who was drawn from his cell before the Inquisition, and accused of having denied that there was a God ; when, picking up a straw that had stuck to his garments, he said, " If there were nothing

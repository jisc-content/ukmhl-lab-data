So, we rather say with Galen — that man had hands given to him be- cause he was the wisest creature, than ascribe his superiority and knowledge to the use of his hands.* This question has arisen from observing the ♦ Ita quidem sapientissimum animalium est homo : ita auteni et manus sunt organa sapienti animali convenientia.

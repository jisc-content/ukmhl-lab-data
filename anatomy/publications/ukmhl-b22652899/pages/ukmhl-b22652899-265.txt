MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF BONE. 245 Perfect security against accidents in the ani- mal body, and in man especially, is not con- sistent with the scheme of nature. Without the precautions and the continued calls to exertion, which danger and the uncertainty of life pro- duce, many of the faculties of the mind would remain unexercised. Whence else would come courage, resolution, and all the manly virtues ? Take away the influence of the uncertain dura- tion of life, and we must suppose also a change in the whole moral constitution of man. Whe- ther we consider the bones as formed to protect important organs, as in the skull: or to be levers to which the muscles are attached, as in the limbs : or in both capacities, as in the texture of the chest: while they are perfectly adapted to their function, they are yet subject to derange- ments from accident. The mechanical adapta- tions are perfectly sufficient to their ends; and afford safety in the natural exercises of the body. To these exercises there is an intuitive impulse, ordered with a relation to the frame of the body ; whilst, on the other hand, we are deterred from the excessive or dangerous use of the limbs by the admonitions of pain. Without such consi- derations, the reader would fall into the mistake that weakness and liability to fracture implied imperfection in the frame of the body : whereas a deeper contemplation of the subject will con- vince him of the incomparable perfection both of

Yet, with all those bones in the paddle, there is still the full complement in the part that corresponds with the arm and fore arm. If the system fail us in such an obvious instance as this, with what confidence can we prosecute the intricate bones of the spine and head under its guidance ? Seeking assistance from the works of dis- tinguished naturalists, we do not always find that disposition of mind prevail, which we should be apt to suppose a necessary result of their peculiar studies. We do not discover that combination of genius with sound sense, which distinguished Cuvier, and the great men of science. It is, above all, surprising with what perverse ingenuity men seek to obscure the conception of a Divine Author, an intelligent, designing, and benevolent Beingâ€”rather clinging to the greatest absurdi- ties, or interposing the cold and inanimate in- fluence of the mere " elements," in a manner to extinguish all feeling of dependance in our minds, and all emotions of gratitude.

COMPARISON OF THE EYE 276 that we owe that sense by which we become familiar with the form, magnitude, and relations of objects. One might as well imagine that he understood the effect and uses of a theodolite by estimating the optical powers of the glasses, without looking to the quadrant, level, or plumb- line, as suppose that he had learnt the whole powers of the eye by confining his study to the naked ball. We must begin our observations by a minute attention to the structure and sensibility of the retina. The retina is the internal coat of the eye ; it consists of a delicate, pulpy, nervous matter, which is contained between two mem- branes of extreme fineness, and these mem- branes both support it and give to its surfaces a smoothness mathematically correct. The matter of the nerve, as well as these supporting mem- branes, are perfectly transparent, during life. In the axis of the eye, there is a small portion which remains transparent, when the rest of the mem- brane becomes opaque, and which has been mis- taken for a foramen,* or hole in the retina. It is surprising, that with all the industry which has been employed to demonstrate the structure of the eye, it is only in the present day that a most essential part of the retina has been discovered the membrane of Mr. Jacob.

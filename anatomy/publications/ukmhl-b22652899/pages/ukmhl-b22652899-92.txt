STRUCTURE OF BIRDS. 72 arm, so is there a more universal relation between those of the whole skeleton. As the structure of the bones declares the provision of the extremity for digging into the ant-hills, so we shall not be disappointed in our expectation of finding a pro- jecting muzzle unarmed with teeth, and a long tongue provided with a glutinous secretion, to lick up the emmets which are disturbed by the animal's scratching. In the skeleton of the cape-mole, we may see, from the projecting acromion scapulae, and a remarkable process of the humerus, that there is a provision for the rotation of the arm, which implies burrowing. But the apparatus seems by no means so perfect as in the mole, implying that it digs in a softer soil than that animal, whilst the possession of gnawing teeth indicates that it lives on roots. In Birds there is altogether a new condition of parts, as there is a new element to contend with. The very peculiar form and structure of their skeleton may be thus accounted for. First, it is necessary that birds, as they are buoyed in the air, be specifically lighter. Se- condly, the circumference of their thorax must be extended, and the motions of their ribs limited, that the muscles of the wings may have sufficient space and firmness for their attachment. Both these objects are attained by a modification of the apparatus of breathing. The lungs are

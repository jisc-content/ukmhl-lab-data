291 WITH THE HAND. ray that falls upon the retina, and the line in which it comes to the eye. But the ray which is here spoken of strikes a mere point of the retina: this point can have no direction ; the obliquity of the incidence of the ray can inform us of nothing: rays of all degrees of obliquity are converging to form that point; and do not the same mathematicians give us, in the first lessons of their science, as the definition of a line—that which is drawn through two points at the least ? Where are the two points here to indicate the direction of the line,—since the cornea, or the humours of the eye,* are not sensible to the passage of the ray ? Or is this an error which has crept in from inaccurate conceptions of the anatomy ? Has the idea that the direction of the ray can afford this know- ledge, arisen from the notion that the ray passes through the thick and turbid matter of the retina ? I woidd ask for what reason is the " finder ' attached to the great telescope? is it not because the larger instrument, from mag- nifying one object in a high degree, cannot be directed in the heavens—the observer seeing with it nothing but that one object? Accordingly, to remedy this there is mounted on the greater telescope a smaller one exactly parallel, of lesser power, but commanding a wider field ; * See a paper by Mr. Alexander Shaw, who has explained this subject very happily.—Journal of the Royal Institution, 1832. u 2

140 THEORY OF THE never consequent upon it. It will be sufficient for our purpose, if we take the highest and the lowest examples. Man has two conditions of existence in the body. Hardly two creatures can be less alike than an infant and a man. The whole foetal state is a preparation for birth. My readers would not thank me, were I to show how necessary all the proportions and forms oi the infant are to his being born alive,—and yet nothing is so easy to demonstrate. Every one may see that from the moment of birth there is a new impulse given to the growth, so as finally to adapt the proportions of the body to the state of perfect manhood. Few, however, are aware that the foetus has a life adapted to its condition, and that if the confinement of the womb were protracted beyond the appointed time, it must die!—from no defect of nourishment, but simply, because the time is come for a change in its whole economy ! Now, during all the long period of gestation, the organs are forming ; the lungs are perfected before the admission of air—new tubes are con- structed before the flood-gates, which are to admit the blood, are opened. But there are finer, and more curious, provisions than these. If we take any of the grand organs, as the heart, or the brain, and examine it through all its gradations of change in the embryo state, we shall recognise it simple, at first, and gradually

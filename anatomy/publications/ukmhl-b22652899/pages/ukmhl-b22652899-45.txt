25 SUITED TO THEIR CONDITION. Littaclied, we can reduce the animals to which they belonged, to their orders, genera, and species, with as much precision as if the recent bodies had been submitted to the eye of the anatomist. Not only can we demonstrate that their feet were adapted to the solid ground, or to the oozy bed of rivers,—for speed, or for grasping and tearing; but judging by these indications of the habits of the animals, we acquire a knowledge of the condition of the earth during their period of existence : that it was suited at one time to the scaly tribe of the lacerta*, with languid motion ; at another, to animals of higher organization, with more varied and lively habits ; and finally we learn, that at any period previous to man's creation, the surface of the earth would have been unsuitable to him. On comparing some of the present races of animals with the fossil remains of individuals of the same family, and which are extinct, some singular opinions on their imperfections have been expressed by Buifon, and adopted by Cu- vier. The animals I allude to are of the tardi- grade family ; the Ai,* in which, as they believe, the defect of organization is the greatest; and the Unau,t which they consider only a little less miserably provided for existence. * Bradypus Tridactylus :—bradypus (slow footed), tridactylus (thret toed), of the order Edentata (wanting incisor teeth). t Bradypus didactylus.

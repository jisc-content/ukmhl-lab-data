186 ORGAN OF TOUCH. in made roads, and with the imperfections of shoeing, the pressure and concussio^'' are too severe and too incessant; so that the protecting sensibihty of the foot is converted into a source of pain from the inflammation which arises, and the horse is thus "foundered." There is a remedy for this condition in dividing the nerve; the consequence of which operation is, that the horse, instead of moving with timid steps, puts out his feet freely, and the lameness is cured. If, however, we were to receive the statement thus barely, the fact would militate against our con- clusion that mechanical provision and sensibility go together, being equally necessary to the per- fection of the instrument. We must take into consideration this leading fact, that pressure against the sole and crust is necessary to the play of the foot and to its perfection. When this part becomes inflamed, the animal does not put its foot freely down, nor does it bear its weight upon the hoof so as to bring all the parts into action; hence contraction is produced, the most common defect of the horse's hoof. When the animal is relieved from pain by the division of the nerve, it uses the foot freely, and use restores all the natural actions of this fine piece of mechanism. It is obvious, however, that there is a certain defect; the horse has lost his natural protection, and must now be indebted to the care of his rider. It has not only lost the pain which

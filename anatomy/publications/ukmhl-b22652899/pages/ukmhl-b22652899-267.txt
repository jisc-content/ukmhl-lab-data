MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF BONE. i24/ else in nature to teach me the existence of a " Deity, this straw would be sufficient." It hardly requires demonstration to prove that, with a given mass of material to make a pillar or column, the hollow cylinder will be the form of strength. The experiments of Du Hainel on the strength of beams afford us the best illus- tration how the material should be arranged to resist transverse fracture. When a beam rests on its extremities, bearing a weight upon its centre, it admits of being divided into three portions ; for these three parts are in a different condition with regard to the weight. The lower part resists fracture by its toughness : the upper part, by its density and resistance to compres- sion : but there is a portion between these which is not acted upon at all; which might be taken away without any considerable weakening of the beam : and which might be added to the upper or the lower part with great advantage. It can readily be understood how a tougher sub- stance added to the lower part would strengthen the beam. We see it in the skin which is laid along the back part of the Indian's bow ; or in the leather of a carriage spring. But the follow- ing is a beautiful experiment to demonstrate what is the quality in the timber which resists, at the upper portion of the beam. If a portion, amounting to nearly a third part, of the beam be cut away and a harder piece of wood be nicely

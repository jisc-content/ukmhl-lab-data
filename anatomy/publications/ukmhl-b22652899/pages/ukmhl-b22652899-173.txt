We should keep in mind the interesting fact, that when surgeons perform the operation of couching, the point of the needle, in passing through the outer coat of the eye, gives a sensa- tion of pricking, which is an exercise of the nerve of touch; but when the point passes througli the retina, which is the expanded nerve of vision, and forms the internal coat of the eye, the sensation that is produced is as of a spark of fire.

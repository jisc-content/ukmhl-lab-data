96 MECHANISM OF of the furthest bone presses the ground, in the ordinary running of the animal,* whilst the claw is thus retracted into a sheath. But when * The pads in the bottom of the lion's foot cover these bones, or rather, we would say, protect them ; they are soft cushions, which add to the elasticity of the foot, and must, in some degree, defend the animal in alighting from its bound. I could not com- prehend how the powerful flexor muscles did not unsheath the claws when the lion made its spring, and how they produced this effect when there was an excitement to seize and hold the prey— I made this dissection to detect the cause. The last bone of the toe is placed in a manner so peculiar in relation to the penulti- mate, being drawn back by the elastic ligament (a) beyond the centre of motion of the joint, that the flexor tendon (b) acting upon it, forces the nearer end, and the cushion of the toe to the ground. But when a more general excitement takes place in the muscles called interossei, and the extensors, d, e, the relative position of the two last bones is altered ; so that the action of the flexor tendon can now draw forward the last bone—thus un- sheathing and uncovering the claw, and preparing it to hold or to tear.

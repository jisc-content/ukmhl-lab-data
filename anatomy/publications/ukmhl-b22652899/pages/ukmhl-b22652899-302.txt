2B'2 COMPARISON OF THE EYE other words, to receive the rays from it upon the more sensible centre. It is this sensibility, therefore, conjoined with the action of the muscles of the eye-ball, which produces the con- stant searching motion of the eye; so that, in effect, from the lesser sensibility of the retina generally, arises the necessity for this exercise of the organ; and to this may be attributed its high perfections. This faculty of searching for the object is slowly acquired in the child; and, in truth, the motions of the eye are made perfect, like those of the hand, by slow degrees. In both organs there is a compound operation :—the impression on the nerve of sense is accompanied with an effort of the will, to accommodate the muscular action to it. It is no contradiction to this, that the faculty of vision is made perfect in the young of some animals from the beginning; no more than that the instinct of the duck, when it runs to the water the moment that the shell is broken, should contradict the fact that the child learns to stand and walk after a thousand re- peated efforts. Let us now see how essential this searching motion of the eye is to vision. On coming into a room, we see the whole side of it at once—the mirror, the pictures, the cornice, the chairs; but we are deceived: being unconscious of the motions of the eye, and that each object is

But the apparatus is not capable of protecting the surface of the eye against the intrusion of a stick or a stone ; from such injuries it could not be defended by a delicate sensibility and invo- luntary action, but only by the effort of the will. In these details we have new proofs of the minute relation which is established between the species of sensibility in an organ and the end to be attained through it. It will not be denied that if it were not for the pain to which the eye is exposed, we should quickly lose the enjoy- ment of the sense of vision altogether. But we were about to institute a comparison of the eye with the heart. The observation of the admirable Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, is to this effect.

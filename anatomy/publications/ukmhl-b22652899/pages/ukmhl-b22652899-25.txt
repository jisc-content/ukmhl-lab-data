INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 5 parts of the animal body, and we may say the strength of the materials, have as certainly a cor- respondence with the weight, as the wheels and levers of a machine, or the scaffolding which sustains them, have relation to the force and velocity of the machinery, or the load that they are employed to raise. The mechanism and organization of animals have been often brought forward for a different purpose from that for which I use them. We find it said, that it is incomprehensible that an all powerful Being should manifest his will in this manner ; that mechanical contrivance implies dif- ficulties overcome: and how strange it is, they add, that the perceptions of the mind, which might have been produced by some direct means, or have arisen spontaneously, are received through an instrument so fine and complex as the eye ;â€” and which requires the creation of the element of light, to enter the organ and to cause vision. For my own part, I think it most natural to contemplate the subject quite differently. We perhaps presume too much, when we say that light has been created for the purpose of vision. We are hardly entitled to pass over its properties as a chemical agent, its influence on the gases, and, in all probability, on the atmosphere, its importance to vegetation, to the formation of the aromatic and volatile principles, and to fructifi- cation, its influence on the animal surface by

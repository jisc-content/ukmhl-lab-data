SUBSTITUTES FOR THE HAND. 129 semble short arms, and are palmated at their tips.* M. Reiiaii, in his history of fishes, affirms that he knew an individual of this species; and the expression is not so incorrect, since he saw it for three days out of the water, walking about the house in the manner of a dog. The circumstance of its walking out of the water has some interest, as showing relations between organs which are apparently the least connected. The fact of this fish living out of the water is doubted ; but the form of its branchial organs, or organs for breath- ing, inclines me to believe it; and its habits require such a provision. In this genus, the oper- culum, which covers the gills, does not open to let the respired water pass off freely behind, as in most fishes; but the water is discharged by a small aperture which, in Mr. Owen's opinion, is capable of being closed by a sphincter muscle. The cavities in which the branchiae lie are large, and this is, indeed, partly the reason of the monstrous head of this fish. Thus, it has not only its fins converted into feet, but its gill- covers into pouches, capable of containing water, and of permitting the function of the branchiae to proceed when the water is retired ; that is, when it lies in mud, or shallow pools; for in such situations does the lophius find its food, and it angles for it in a very curious manner. * These fins have two bones in them like the radius and ulna; but Cuvier says, that they are more strictly bones of the carpus.

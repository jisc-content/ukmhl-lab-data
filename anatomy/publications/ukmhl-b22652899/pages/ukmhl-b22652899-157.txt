137 ELEMENTAL PARTS. every species of animals, however different in form and structure. But by the elements which are now mentioned, the authors of this new theory mean certain pieces which enter into the structure of the body ; and which they sup- pose may be transposed and differently ar- ranged. They illustrate their views by the analogy of the building materials of a house. If these materials, they say, are exhausted in the ornamental parts of the portico and ves- tibule, there must be a proportionate limitation of the apartments for the family ! This new theory has been brought forward with the highest pretensions; the authors of it have called upon us to mark the moment of its conception as the commencement of a new aera! They speak of the " elective affinities of organs." " the balancing of organs," " a new principle of connection," and a "new theory of analysis."â€” The hypothesis essentially is this, that when a part, which belongs to one animal, is missed in another, we are to seek for it in some neighbour- ing organ : and on such grounds they affirm, that this surpasses all former systems as a means of discovery. Now, the perfection or aggran- dizement of any one organ of an animal is not attended with the curtailment or proportional deficiency of any other. Like ourselves, per- haps, the supporters of this theory dwell too much upon the bones; but even in them, we

205 THE MUSCULAR POWER REMAINING. distance, the size, the weight, the form, the hardness or softness, the roughness or smooth- ness of objects, results from there being this combined perception—from the sensibility of the proper organ of touch being combined with the consciousness of the motion of the arm, hand, and fingers. But the motion of the fingers is especi- ally necessary to the sense of touch. These bend, extend, or expand, moving in all directions like palpa, with the advantage of embracing the ob- ject, and feeling it on all its surfaces, sensible to its solidity and to its resistance when grasped, moving round it and gliding over its surfaces, and, therefore, feeling every asperity. THE PLEASURES ARISING FROM THE MUSCULAR SENSE. The exercise of the muscular frame is the source of much of the knowledge which is usually supposed to be obtained through the organs of the senses; and to this source, also, we must trace some o£ our chief enjoyments. We may, indeed, affirm that it is benevolently provided that the vigorous circulation of the blood, and, therefore, the healthful condition both of the mind and the body shall result from muscular exertion and the alternations of activity and repose.

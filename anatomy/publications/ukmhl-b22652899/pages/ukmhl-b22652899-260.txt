240 ADDITIONAL ILLUSTRATION^. which we have seen attained by means of the skeleton. Distinct members are formed, with the power of walking, leaping, flying, holding, spin- ning, and weaving. The hardened integuments, thus articulated and performing the office of bones, have, like them, spines and processes; with this difference, that their aspect is towards the centre, instead of projecting exteriorly. Were we to compare the system of " resisting parts" in man and in the insect, we should be forced to acknowledge the mechanical provisions to be superior in the lower animal! The first advan- tage of the skeleton (as we may be permitted to call the system of hard parts in the insect) being external and lifeless, is, that it is capable of having greater hardness and strength bestowed Tupon it, according to the necessities of the ani- mal, than can be bestowed upon bone. True bone, being internal and growing wath the animal, is penetrated with blood vessels; and therefore must be porous and soft. The next advantage is mechanical. The hard material is strong to resist fracture, and to bear the action of muscles, in proportion to its distance from the centre ; for the muscles in the insect, instead of sur- rounding the bones, as in the higher animals, are contained within the shell, and the shell is, consequently, so much the further thrown off" from the axis. When considering the larger vertebral ani-

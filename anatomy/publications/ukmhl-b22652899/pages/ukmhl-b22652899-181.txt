SENSIBILITY OF THE EYE. 101 variety or contrast is necessary to sensation, the finest organ of sense losing its property by the continuance of the same impression. It is by a comparison of cold and heat that we enjoy either condition. To contrast still more strongly the sensibility of the surface with the property of internal parts, to show how very different sensibility is, in reality, from what is suggested by first expe- rience, and how admirably it is varied and ac- commodated to the functions, we shall add one other fact. The brain is insensibleâ€”that part of the brain, which if disturbed or diseased, takes away consciousness, is as insensible as the leather of our shoe! That the brain may be touched, or a portion of it cut off, without inter- rupting the patient in the sentence that he is uttering, is a surprising circumstance! From this fact Physiologists formerly inferred that the surgeon had not reached the more important organ of the brain. But that opinion arose from the notion prevailing that a nerve must neces- sarily be sensible. Whereas, when we consider that the different parts of the nervous system have totally distinct endowments, and that there are nerves, as I have elsewhere shown, insensible to touch and incapable of giving pain, though exquisitely alive to their proper office, we have no just reason to conclude that the brain should be sensible, or exhibit the property of a nerve of M

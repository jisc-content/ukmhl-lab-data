274 VARIATIONS FN THE CENTRE. I hope that I have gone far enough to prove that where there is uniformity in the shape of any part of the skeleton, it depends on the per- manence of the function of the organ to which it stands related. The head and spine are, in certain respects, permanent in their forms; because the brain and spinal marrow vary only in size: but as far as regards their motions, their processes and articulations, they are very curiously changed and suited to the varying uses of the parts; and we may observe that there is no change in any part of the body—for example, in the spine, or the occiput, or the jaws, or the teeth, or the pelvis, or the extre- mities—without a corresponding adaptation ex- tending through the whole skeleton.

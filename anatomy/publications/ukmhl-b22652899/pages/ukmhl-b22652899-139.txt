OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ARM. the conformity which subsists among all the parts of an animal body, he will readily com- prehend that there is a perfect relation between the bones and the muscles : that as the bones change, and exhibit a variety in their size, relative position, and articulations, so there is an adaptation of the muscles. Accordingly, we sometimes find the muscles separated into smaller, and sometimes consolidated into more powerful masses. The demonstration to the anatomical student of the muscles of the human hand and arm, be- comes the test of his master's perfection as a teacher. Nothing is more uninteresting, tedious, and difficult to attend to, than the demonstration of the muscles of the arm, when they are taken successively, as they present themselves ; but when they are taught with lucid arrangement, according to the motions performed by them, it is positively agreeable to find how much interest may be given to the subject. It would be foreign to the object of this work to introduce such demonstrations here. Yet it is very remarkable that the muscles of the arm and hand should resemble so closely the muscles of the fore extremity of the lion, for example. I have added a sketch of the muscles of the lion's fore leg and paw; in which we see that the shape bears a great resemblance to the fore-arm of man. The flexors, extensors, pro-

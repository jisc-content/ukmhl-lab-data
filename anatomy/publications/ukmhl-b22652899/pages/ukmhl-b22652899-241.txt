AND SUCCESSIVE EPOCHS. 221 gone, we see an established relation between the animal created, and the elements around. It is idle to suppose this a matter of chance. Either tlie structure and functions of the animal must have been formed to correspond with the con- dition of the elements, or the elements must have been controlled to minister to the neces- sities of the animal; and if the most careful investigation lead us to this conclusion, in con- templating all the inferior gradations of animal existence, what is it that makes us so unwilling to admit such an influence in the last grand work of creation ? We cannot resist those proofs of a beginning, or of design prevailing everywhere, or of a First Cause. When we are bold enough to extend our enquiries into the great revolutions which have taken place, whether in the condition of the earth or in the structure of the animals which have inhabited it, our notions of the " uniformity " of the course of nature must suffer some modification.

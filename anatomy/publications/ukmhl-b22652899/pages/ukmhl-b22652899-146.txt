120 CHAPTER V. THE SUBSTITUTION OF OTHER ORGANS FOR THE HAND. After having examined the manner in which one instrument, the hand, is modified and adapted to a variety of purposes in different animals, there remains only this mode of eluci- dationâ€”that we contrast it with its imperfect substitutes in other creatures. I might, indeed, have shown in the insect tribes the most curious examples of instruments for similar purposes with the hand and fingers of man; but I have intentionally confined this inquiry to the higher classes of animals. The habits of some fishes require that they should cling firmly to the rocks or to whatever presents to them. Their locomotive powers are perfect; but how are they to become stationary in the tide or the stream 1 I have often thought it wonderful that the salmon or the trout, for ex- ample, should keep its place, night and day, in the rapid current.

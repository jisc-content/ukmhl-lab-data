290 COMPARISON OF THE EYE the subject without any explanation at all, and does not show how it is that the mind looks into this camera. The question will be, at least, more simple, if we consider the vision of a point; and ask ourselves how we know the direction in which that point comes to the eye. Suppose it is a star in the heavens, or a beacon, seen by the mariner. Must he not, in order to ascertain the position of the star, find out some other object of comparison, some other star, which shall dis- close to him the constellation to which the one that he is examining belongs : or to ascertain the position of the beacon, must he not look to his compass and card, and so trace the direction of the lighthouse in relation to them ? This is, in fact, the process that is followed in every thing which we see. A single point is directly in the axis of the eye, but we cannot judge of its position, without turning to some other point, and becoming sensible of the traversing of the eye-ball and the angle to which the eye is moved : or if we do not see another point to compare the first with, we must judge of its place by means of a comparison with the motion of the eye itself. We are sensible that the eye is directed to the right or to the left; and we compare the visible impression on the nerve with the motion, its direction, and its extent. We find even mathematicians affirming that we judge of the direction of an object by the

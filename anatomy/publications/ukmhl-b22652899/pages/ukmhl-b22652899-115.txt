But we must preface this part of our subject by some remarks on the form of the claws of the lion.

The first combine a keen sense of smelling with a power of continued speed ; they run down their prey. The feline order have their superiority in the fineness of their sight, accompanied with a patience, watchfulness, and stealthy move- ment ; they spring upon their prey, and never long pursue it. They attain their object in a few bounds, and, failing, sulkily resume their watch. When we look to the claws, we see a corres- pondence with those habits. The claws of the dog and wolf are coarse and strong, and bear the pressure and friction incident to a long chase They are calculated to sustain and protect the foot.

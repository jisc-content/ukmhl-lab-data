ORGAN OF TOUCH. 184 the nerves are sufficiently protected, while they are exposed to impressions through the elastic cuticle, and thus give the sense of touch. The organization is simple, yet it is in strict analogy with the other organs of sense. Every one must have observed a tendency in the cuticle to become thickened and stronger by pressure and friction. If the pressure be partial and severe, the action of the true skin is too much excited, fluid is thrown out, and the cuticle is raised in a blister. If it be still partial, but more gradually applied, a corn is formed. If, however, the general surface of the palms or soles be exposed to pressure, the cuticle thickens, until it becomes a defence like a glove or a shoe. Now, what is most to be admired in this thickening of the cuticle is, that the sense of touch is not lost, or indeed diminished, certainly not at all in proportion to the protection afforded by the thickening of the skin. The thickened cuticle partakes of the struc- ture of the hoofs of animals : and we shall now attend to the nature of the hoof, as the best pos- sible illustration of the manner in which the sen- sibility of the skin is in a due degree preserved whilst the surface is guarded. The human nail is a continuation of the cuticle, and the hoof of an animal belongs to the same class of parts. In observing the manner

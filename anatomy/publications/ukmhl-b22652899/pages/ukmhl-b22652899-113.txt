FOOT OF RUMINANTS. 93 cannon bone, with its two pasterns, supports this toe, and is joined by ligament to the larger cannon bone, so that it must have great elas- ticity. As a division of the flexor tendon nuis into it, it must increase the spring when the animal rises from its crouching position. We see, in these sketches, that the lesser metacarpal bone, which, in the horse, entered into the joint of the " knee," is here brought down to increase the elasticity, or to expand the foot. The two lateral toes of the hog are short, and do not touch the ground, yet they must serve to sustain the animal when the foot sinks. In the rein-deer these bones are strong and deep, and the toe, by projecting backwards, extends the foot horizontallyâ€”thus giving the animal a broader base to stand on, and adapting it to the snows of Lapland, on the principle of the snow-shoe. The systematic naturalist will call these changes in the size, number, and place of the metacarpal bones " gradationsI see in them only new proofs of the same system of bones being applicable to every circumstance, or condition of animals, and furnishing us with other instances of adaptation. I have explained why I think that the bones of the elephant's leg stand so perpendicularly over each other; there is a peculiarity also in the bones of the foot. In the foot of the living animal we see only a round pliant mass, which, when

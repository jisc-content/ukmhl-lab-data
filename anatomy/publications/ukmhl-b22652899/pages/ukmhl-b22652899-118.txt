yQ PRESIDENT JEFFERSON AND CUVIER. ledge of anatomy enabled him to draw a different conclusion. He first observed that there was a spine in the middle of the articulating surface of the last bone ; which in this respect was unlike the form of the same bone in the feline tribe. He found no provision, in this specimen of an extinct ani- mal, for the lateral attachment of the bone; which we have just shown to be necessary for its retraction. Then observing what portion of a circle this bone formed, he prolonged the line, and showed that the claw belonging to it must have been of such great length, that it could never have been retracted to the effect of guarding an acute and sharp point. The point,therefore, could not have been raised vertically, so as to have per- mitted the animal to put the foot to the ground without blunting the instrument! Pursuing such a comparison, he rejected the idea of the bone belonging to an animal of the feline tribe at all. His attention was directed to another order, the paresseux or sloths, which have great toes and long nails (p. 26). Their nails are folded up in a different fashion ; they just enable the animal to walk ; but slowly and awkwardly, something in the same manner as if we were to fold our fingers on the palm of the hand, and bear upon our knuckles. On instituting a more just com- parison between these bones of the ancient animal and the corresponding bones of the paresseux, he has satisfied us that the lion of

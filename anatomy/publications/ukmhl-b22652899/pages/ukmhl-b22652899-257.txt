ADDITIONAL ILLUSTRATIONS. THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOLID STRUC^ TURE OF THE ANIMAL BODY CONSIDERED. I YIELD to the suggestion of friends in further pursuing the subject of the soUd textures of the animal frame, with the proofs of design which are exhibited in its mechanical provisions. It has been shown in the first chapter that soUdity and gravity are qualities necessary to every inhabitant of the earth: the first to pro- tect it; the second, that the animal may stand, and possess that resistance, which shall make the muscles available for action. The first material to be taken notice of, which bestows this necessary firmness on the animal textures, is the cellular substance. This consists of delicate membranes, which form cells; these cells communicate with each other, and the tissue thus composed enters every where into the structure of the animal frame. It con- stitutes the principal part of the medusa, which floats like a bubble on the water; and it is found in every texture of the human body. It forms the most delicate coats of the eye;

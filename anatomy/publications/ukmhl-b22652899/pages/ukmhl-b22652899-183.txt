163 SENSIBILITY OF THE EYE. quisite sensibility to direct it—not that kind of sensibility which enables the eye to receive the impressions of light—but a property more re- sembling the tenderness of the skin, yet happily adapted, by its fineness, to the condition of the organ. A nerve, possesses of a quality totally different from that of the optic nerve, extends overall the exterior surfaces of the eye, and gives to those surfaces their delicate sensibility. Now it some- times happens that this nerve is injured and its function lost; the consequences of which are very curious, — smoke and offensive particles, which are afloat in the atmosphere, rest upon the eye : flies and dust lodge under the eyelids, without producing sensation, and without ex- ^ citing either the hydraulic or the mechanical apparatus to act for the purpose of expelling them. But although they do not give pain, they nevertheless stimulate the surfaces so as to produce inflammation, and that causes opacity in the fine transparent membranes of the eye ; and the organ is lost, although the proper nerve of vision remains entire. I have seen many instances of the eye being thus destroyed for want of sensibility to touch,* and it has been curious to remark, on these occasions, that when * They are stated at length in my papers in the Philosophical Transaciions, and in the Appendix of my work on the Nervous System.

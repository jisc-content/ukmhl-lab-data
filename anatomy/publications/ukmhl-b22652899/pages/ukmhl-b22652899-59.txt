But I contend that the term is quite inapplicable, and worse than use- less, as tending to check enquiry. What then is the meaning of this variation in the form of the extremities and the comparative permanence towards the centre of the skeleton ? I conceive the rationale to be this, that the central parts, by which in fact they mean the skull, spine, and ribs, are permanent in their offices ; whilst the extremities vary and are adapted to every exterior circumstance. The office of the back part of the skull is to protect the brain, that of the spine to contain the spinal marrow, and of the ribs to perform respiration. Why should we expect these parts to vary in shape while their office remains the same ? But the shoulder must vary in form, as it does in motion. The shape of the bones and the joints of the extremities must be adapted to their various actions, and the carpus, or the tarsus, and phalanges* must change, more than all the rest, to accommodate the extremity to its different offices. Is it not mote pleasing to see the reason of this most surprising adjustment, than merely to say it is a law ? t There is yet another opinion, which will suggest * Carpus, the wrist; tarsus, the ankle or instep; phalanges, the rows of bones forming the fingers or toes, t See the additional illustrations.

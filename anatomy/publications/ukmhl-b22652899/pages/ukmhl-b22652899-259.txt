Their skins suffice ; they are hardened by a deposit within them for this purpose ; but if this skin were not further provided, it would be rigid and unyielding, and be no substitute for bone. These hardened integuments are, therefore, divided into rings; to these the muscles are attached; and as the cellular mem- brane between the rings is pliant, these anne- lides can creep and turn in every direction. Without further argument, we perceive how the skin, by having a hard matter deposited in it, is adapted to all the purposes of the skeleton. It is worthy of notice that some animals, still lower in the scale,â€”the tubipores, sertularia, cellularia, &c., exhibit something like a skeleton. They are contained within a strong case from which they can extend themselves, whilst the corals and madrepores, on the other hand, have a central axis of hard material, the soft animal substance being, in a manner, seated upon it. But these substitutes for the skeleton are, like shell, foreign to the living animal; although in office they may resemble bone in sustaining the softer substance and giving form. In the proper insect I should say that there is a nearer approach to a skeleton, did it not appear that the apparatus is more perfect than in some of the animals which have a true ske- leton. The resisting material is here deposited externally, and is converted to every purpose

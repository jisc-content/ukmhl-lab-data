90 OF THE horse's FOOT. This subject is of such general interest, that I may venture on a little more detail. The elastic or suspending ligament spoken of above, passes down from the back of the cannon bone, along all the bones, to the lowest, the coffin bone; it yields, and allows these bones to bend. Behind the ligament the great tendons run, and the most prolonged of these, that of the perforans muscle, is principally inserted into the coffin bone, having at the same time other attach- ments. Under the bones and tendon, at the sole of the foot, there is a soft elastic cushion ; this cushion is the fatty frog, and rests on the proper horny frog, that prominence of a triangular shape, which is seen in the hollow of the sole. The soft elastic matter being pressed down, shifts a little backwards, so that it expands the heels, at the same time that it bears on the horny frog, and presses out the lateral part of the crust. We perceive that there is a necessity for the bottom of the hoof being hollow or concave â€”first, to prevent the delicate apparatus of the foot from being bruised, and, secondly, that elasticity may be obtained by its descent. We see that the expansion of the hoof, or properly the crust, and the descent of the sole are necessary to the play of the internal apparatus of the foot. The crust is not equally elastic ; the anterior part having to resist the whole strength of the animal, as in straining to drag a load, is very firm and inelastic.

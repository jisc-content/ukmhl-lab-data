RIGHT HAND OVER THE LEFT. 123 operations, are subject to be influenced and ad- justed according to the necessity for the increase or diminution of the circulation. If such a peculiarity in the form of the vessels in the extremities of these animals, retards the blood, it can only be during repose; for, on ex- citement, so far from retarding, it must bestow remarkable power of acceleration. I conclude, therefore, that this variety of distribution in the arteries is a provision for occasional great activity in the muscles of the limb, and for forcing the blood into contact with the fibres, notwithstand- ing their continued action and rigidity. We have seen in the preceding chapter that the same organ, which moves at one time as slowly as the hand of a watch, at another moves with extreme rapidity : consequently, we can not admit the inference that the tortuous and sub-divided artery is a provision for languid motions. In speaking of the arteries which go to the hand, it may be expected that we should touch on a subject, which has been formerly a good deal discussed, whether the properties of the right hand, in comparison with those of the left, depend on the course of the arteries to it. It is affirmed that the trunk of the artery going to the right arm, passes off from the heart so as to admit the blood directly and more forcibly into

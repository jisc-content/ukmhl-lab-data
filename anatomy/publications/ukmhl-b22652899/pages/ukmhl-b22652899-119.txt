ON THE MEGALONIX. 99 the American President was an animal which scratched the ground and fed on roots. One experiences something like relief to find that there never was such an enormous car- nivorous animal as this denominated megalonix. These finger-bones, or bones of the claws, exhibit a very remarkable correspondence with the habits and general forms of animals. Besides what we have seen in the lion, or tiger, in the dog or wolf, in the bear, and ant-eater, there is a variety, where we should least expect it, in the animals that live in woods, and climb the branches of trees. The squirrel, with claws set both ways, runs with equal facility up and down the bole, and nestles in the angles of the branches. The monkey leaps and swings him- self from branch to branch, and springing parts with his hold by the hinder extremities, before he reaches another with the anterior extremities ; he leaps the intervening space, and catches with singular precision.

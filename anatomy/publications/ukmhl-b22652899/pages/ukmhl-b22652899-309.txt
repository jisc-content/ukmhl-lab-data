But in these animals, every corresponding fa- culty is, in the same manner, perfect from the beginning: the dropped foal, or the Iamb, rises and follows its mother. We must no more com- pare the helpless human offspring with the young of these animals than with a fly, the existence of which is limited to an hour at noon,—which breaking from its confinement, knows its mate and deposits its eggs on the appropriate tree — the willow or the thorn, and dies. Bvit this is foreign to our enquiry ; since it is obvious that the human eye has no such original power of vision bestowed upon it, and that it is acquired, as the exercise of the other senses, and the faculties of the mind itself are, by repeated efforts, or experience.

fjO COMPARATIVE ANATOMY extremity, being deprived of all support from the thorax, depend upon themselves for security. Here the bones, corresponding to the sternum, clavicles, and scapulae, are found clinging to the spine, and forming, like the pelvis,* a circle, to the lateral part of which the humerus is articulated. In the chelonian order,t the tortoises, we see another design accomplished, in the union of these bones; and the change is owing to a very curious circumstance. The spine and ribs of these ani- mals form the rafters of their strong shell; and consequently they are external to the bones of the shoulder. The scapulae and clavicles being thus within the thorax, and having nothing in their grasp, neither ribs nor spine, they must neces- sarily fall together, and form a circle, in order to * The pelvis is the circle of bones on which the spine or back- bone rests, and in which are the sockets for the heads of the thiffh bones. t See again the appendix iii.

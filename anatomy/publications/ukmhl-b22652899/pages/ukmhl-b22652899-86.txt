COMPARATIVE ANATOMY articulation with the glenoid cavity or socket of the scapula, and we see that the two tubercles, near the joint, are depressed, and do not interfere with the revolving of the humerus, by striking against the edges of the socket. Such appear- ances alone are sufficient to show that all the motions of the arm are free. To give assurance of this, suppose that the geologist has picked up this bone in interesting circumstances. To what animal does it be- long? The circular form of the articulating surface, and the very slight projec- tion of the tubercles, evince a latitude and extent of motion. Now, freedom of motion in the shoulder implies freedom also in the extremity or paw, and rotation of the bones of the wrist. Accordingly, we direct the eye to that part of this humerus which gives origin to the muscles for turning the wrist, (the Supinator muscles), and in the prominence and length of the ridge or crest which is on the lower and outer side of the bone, we have proof of the strength of these muscles and consequently of the free motion of the paw. Therefore, on finding the humerus thus cha- racterized, we conclude, that it belonged to an animal with sharp moveable claws; that, in all probability, it is the remains of a bear.

76 STRUCTURE ADAPTED power, as well as continuance of muscular ex- ertion. We see how nature completes her work when the intention is that the animal shall rise buoyant and powerful in the air:â€”the whole texture of the frame is altered and made light, in a manner consistent with strength. We see also how the mechanism of the anterior extremity is changed, and the muscles of the trunk differently directed. But we are tempted to examine those means, which we would almost say are more awkwardly suited for their purpose, where the system of bones and muscles, peculiar to the quadruped, is preserved, while a power of launching into the air is also given. We have already taken notice of the structure of the bat as adapted to flight; but there are other animals which enjoy this function though in a lesser degree. For example, the flying squirrel (Petromys Volucella), being chased to the end of the bough, spreads out its mantle from one extremity to the other, and drops in the air, with such a resistance from its ex- tended skin and its tail, that it can direct its flight obliquely downwards, and even turn in the air. But to this end, there is no necessity for any adaptation of the anterior extremity. Among reptiles there is a provision of the same kind, in the Draco fimbriatus ; which is capable of creep- ing to a height and dropping safely to the ground, under the protection of a sort of parachute, formed by its extended skin. This is not an inapt illus-

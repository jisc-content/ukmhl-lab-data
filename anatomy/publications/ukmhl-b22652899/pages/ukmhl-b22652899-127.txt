PECULIARITIES IN THE HAND. 107 hand, and between the metacarpal bones, there are small muscles (Lumbricales and Interossei), which perform the finer motions, expanding the fingers and moving them in every direction, with great quickness and delicacy. These are the organs which give the hand the power of spin- ning, weaving, engraving; and as they produce the quick motions of the musician's fingers, they are called by the anatomist Jidicinales. Atten- tion to our most common actions will shew us how the division into fingers, by combining motion with the sense of touch, adapts the hand to grasp, to feel, and to compare. We shall presently see how well the points of the fingers are provided for feeling : as the joints and nume- rous muscles of the hand are adapted for various distinct or separate motions. In this sketch we have the bones of the paw of the adult Chimpanzee, from Borneo; and the remarkable peculiarity is the smallness of the thumb ; it extends no further than to the root of the lingers. On the length, strength, free hiteral motion, and perfect mobility of the thumb,

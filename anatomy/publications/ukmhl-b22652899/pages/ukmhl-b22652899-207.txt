The teeth are provided with sensibility much in the same manner as the hoof of the horse is ; for although the bone and enamel have no sensibility, yet a branch of a sensible nerve (the fifth) enters into the cavity of every tooth, and the vibration being communicated through the tooth to the nerve, the smallest grain is felt between the teeth. But, to return to the human hand ; in the fingers and palm of a man who uses the fore- hammer, the cuticle is thickened in a remarkable manner. The depressed lines, however, in its inner surface become deeper, and the villi pro- jecting into them longer; which, joined to the aptitude of the cuticle to convey the impression to those included nerves, leaves him in posses- sion of the sense of touch in a very high degree. In the foot of the ostrich we have a magnified view of the thickened cuticle and the lengthened nerves. This outer skin of its foot almost equals in thickness the hoof of the soUdungnla, and when it is separated from the sensible sole, the villi, or papillse, having in them the sensible nerves, are withdrawn, leaving corresponding foramina or pores in the sole.

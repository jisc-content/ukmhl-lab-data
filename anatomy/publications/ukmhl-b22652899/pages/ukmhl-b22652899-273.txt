253 OF THE MUSCULAR AND ELASTIC FORCES. The muscular power is contrasted with the elastic, as possessing a living property of mo- tion. We acquiesce in the distinction, since the muscular fibre ceases to have irritability or power in death, while elasticity continues in the dead part. But yet there is a pro- perty in the elasticity of the living body which cannot be retained after death. To illustrate this, we shall take the instance of the elasticity in the catgut string of a harp. Suppose that the string is screwed tight, so as to vibrate in a given time, and to sound the note correctly ; if that string be struck rudely, it is put out of tune ; that is, it is stretched and somewhat relaxed, and no longer vibrates in time. This does not take place in the living fibre; for here there is a property of restoration. If we see the tuner screwing up the harp string, and with difficulty, and after repeated attempts, bringing it to its due tension, â€”trying it with the tuning fork, and with his utmost acquired skill restoring it to its former elasticity, we have a demonstration of how much life is performing in the fibres of the animal frame, after every effort or exertion; and the more powerful the mechanical parts of the body

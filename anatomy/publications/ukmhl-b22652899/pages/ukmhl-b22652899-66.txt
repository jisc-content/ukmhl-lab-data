4(> COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE CLAVICLE. The clavicle, or collar bone, is that which runs across from the breast bone to the top of the shoulder. The square form of the chest, and the free exercise of the hand, are very much owing to this bone. It keeps the shoulders apart from the chest, and throws the action of the muscles upon the arm bone, which, but for it, would be drawn inwards, and contract the upper part of the trunk. If we take the motions of the anterior extre- mity in different animals as our guide, we shall see why this bone is perfect in some, and entirely wanting in others. Animals which fly, or dig, or climb, as bats, moles, porcupines, squirrels, ant-eaters, armadilloes, and sloths, have this bone, for in them, a lateral or outward motion A. Triangular portion of the Sternum, or breast bone. b. b. Clavicles, or collar bones, c. c. Scapulae, or shoulder blades. D. Coracoid process of the Scapula, e. Acromion process of the Scapulae, forming the tip of the shoulder.

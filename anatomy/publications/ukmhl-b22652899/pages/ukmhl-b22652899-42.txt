FOSSILIZED BONES SHEW perform actions the most minute and compli- cated, consistently with powerful exertion. The wonder still is, that whether we examine this system in man, or in any of the inferior species of animals, nothing can be more curiously adjusted or appropriated; and we should be in- clined to say, whatever instance occupied our thoughts for the time, that to this particular object the system had been framed. The view which the subject opens to us, is unbounded. The curious synthesis by which we ascertain the nature, condition, and habits of an extinct animal, from the examination of its fossil remains, is grounded on a knowledge of the sys- tem of which we are speaking. A bone consists of many parts; but for our present purpose it is only necessary to observe that the hard sub- stance, the phosphate of lime, which we familiarly recognise as bone, is every where penetrated by membranes and vessels as delicate as those which belong to any other part of the body. Some bones are found with their animal part remaining, others are fossilized. The phosphate of lime loses its phosphoric acid, and the earth of bone remains incorruptible, while the softer animal matter undergoes the process of decom- position, and is dissipated. The bone in this condition may become fossilized; silicious earth, or lime in composition with iron, or iron pyrites, may pass by infiltration into the interstices of

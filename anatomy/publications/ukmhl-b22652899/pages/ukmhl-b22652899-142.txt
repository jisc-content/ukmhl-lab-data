122 SUPERIORITY OF THE to the muscles.* It has been argued that this peculiarity, as it produces a retardation of the blood, is adapted to long continued action in the muscles. I believe it to be a provision for long continued action ; because the animals which possess it, are not more remarkable for the slowness of their progression than for the tenacity of their hold : the extremities are long and the muscles powerful, either for sustaining the animal by grasping the branches of trees, or for digging; but surely the strength of the muscles cannot be produced by retardation of the circulation, on the principle, universally admitted, that the expenditure of arterial blood is in proportion to the vital force employed. Were the arteries of the living body like rigid tubes, and the laws of the circulation the same as those of hydraulics, such might be the conclusion. But it is impossible to believe that the circulation of the blood can be per- formed according to the laws which govern the flow of water in dead tubes. The artery is dila- table ; it contracts with a vital force; and both the dilatability and the contractility of arteries are subject to the influence of the living prin- ciple. When, therefore, the artery of a limb is divided into four or five vessels, the result is a greater capacity of dilatation, and a greater power of contraction; and these being vital * There is some doubt as to the reunion of the vessels.

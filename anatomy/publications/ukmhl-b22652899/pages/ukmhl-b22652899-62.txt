42 COMPARATIVE ANATOMY as it exists in man, and in the higher division of animals which give suck, the mammaha—in those which propagate by eggs, the oviparous animals, —birds, reptiles, amphibia, and fishes; and we shall find the bones which are identified by cer- tain common features, adjusted to various pur- poses, in all the series from the arm to the fin. We shall recognise them in the mole, formed into a powerful apparatus for digging, by which the animal soon covers itself, and burrows its way under ground. In the wing of the eagle we shall count every bone adapted to a new element, and as powerful to rise in the air, as the fin of the salmon is to strike through the water. The solid hoof of the horse, the cleft foot of the rumi- nant, the paw with retractile claws of the feline tribe, the long folding nails of the sloth, are among the many changes that are found in the adjustment of the chain of bones, which in man, ministers to the compound motions of the hand. Were it my purpose to teach the elements of this subject, I should commence by examining the lowest animals, and trace the bones of the anterior extremity as they come to resemble the human arm, and to be employed for a greater variety of uses in the higher animals; but as my present object is illustration only, I shall begin with the human hand, and compare its parts. With this view, I shall divide the extremity into the shoulder, arm, and hand, and treat each

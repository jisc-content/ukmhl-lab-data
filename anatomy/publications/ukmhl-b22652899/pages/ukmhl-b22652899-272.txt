252 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF BONE. of the joint being impeded. In machinery it is found that, if the pressure be the same, the ex- tension of the surfaces in contact does not in- crease the friction. If, for example, a stone or a piece of timber, of the shape of a book or a brick, be laid upon a flat surface, it may be drawn across it with equal facility, whether it rests upon its edge or upon its side. The friction of the bones, which enter into the struc- ture of the knee joint, is not increased by their greater diameter : while obvious advantages are gained by their additional breadth ; the ligaments which knit these bones give more strength than they otherwise would, and the tendons which run over them, being removed to a distance from the centre, have more power.

With respect to the superiority of man being in his mind, and not merely in the provisions of his body, it is no doubt true;—but as we proceed, we shall find how the Hand supplies all instruments, and by its correspondence with the intellect gives him universal dominion. It presents the last and best proof of that principle of adaptation which evinces design in the creation. Another notion which we meet with, is, that the variety of animals is not a proof of design, as showing a relation between the formation of their organs and the necessity for their exercise; but that the circumstances in which the animal has been placed have been the cause of the variety. The influence of these circumstances, it is pre- tended, has in the long progress of time, produced a complication of structure out of an animal which was at first simple. We shall reserve the discussion of this subject until we have the data before us; which, of themselves, and without much argument, will suffice to overthrow it.* I may notice here another idea of naturalists, who are pleased to reduce these changes in the struc- ture of animals into general laws. They affirm that in the centre of the animal body there is no disposition to change, whilst in the extremities we see surprising variations of form. If this be

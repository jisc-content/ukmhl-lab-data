132 SUBSTITUTES FOR THE HAND. parative anatomy, I found that a nerve corres- ponding to this, which is the fifth nerve in man, served a similar purpose in all the lower animals. In creatures which are covered with feathers or scales, or protected by shell, this nerve be- comes almost the sole organ of sensibility. It is the developement of this nerve which gives sensibility to the cirri, which hang about the mouths of fishes, and to the palpa of the Crustacea and insects. It is the same nerve which supplies the tongue, and is the organ of its exquisite sensibility to touch, as well as of taste. In some animals, especially in the rep- tiles, the tongue, by its length and mobility, becomes a substitute for these external append- ages. We might have noticed before, that the tongue is an organ of prehension as well as of touch. With it the ox gathers in the herbage; and in the giraffe, it is rather curious to observe that as the whole frame of the animal is calcu- lated to raise the head to a great height, so is the tongue capable of projecting beyond the mouth to an extraordinary extent, to wrap round and pull down the extreme branches of trees. The whiskers of the feline quadrupeds possess a fine sensibility through branches of the fifth nerve, which enter their roots. Birds have a high de- gree of sensibility to touch in their mouths. In ducks, and all that quaffer with their bills under water, the sense is very fine, and we find, on dis-

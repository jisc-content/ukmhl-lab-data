118 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES two forces, progressively increasing, greatly augment the velocity of the descent. The same interchange of power for velocity, which takes place in the arm, adapts a man's hand and fingers to a thousand arts, requiring quick or lively motions. The fingers of a lady, playing on the pianoforte, or the compositor with his types, are instances of the advantage gained by this sacrifice of force for velocity of movement. The spring of the foot and toe is bestowed in the same manner, and gives elasticity and rapidity in running, dancing, and leaping. After the many illustrations from mechanics which we have offered, the muscular power itself must be a subject of surprise and admiration. Gravity, the running of water, the expansion and condensation of steam, the production of gases, the spring or elasticity of material, or all these com- bined, could not have answered the varied offices performed by this one property of life possessed by the muscles. The irritable and contractile fibre, matter which, chemically considered, does not differ from the fibrine of the blood, being endowed with this property of contraction, and adapted with " mechanical ingenuity," fulfils a thousand distinct purposes, in volition, breath- ing, speaking, in digestion, assimilation, circu- lation ; and in all these it is modified to the wants and condition of every class of animals.

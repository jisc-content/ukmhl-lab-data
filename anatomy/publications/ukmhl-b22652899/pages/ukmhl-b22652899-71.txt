THE BONES OF THE SHOULDER. 51 roll the scapula and toss the arm, in every direc- tion. When the muscles combine in action, they fix the bone, and either raise the ribs in drawing breath, or give firmness to the whole frame of the trunk. Before I remark further on the influence of the scapulae on the motions of the ann, I shall give an instance in proof of a very important function which they perform. Hearing that there was a lad of fourteen years of age, born without arms, I sent for him. I found that indeed he had no arms, but he had clavicles and scapulae. When I made this boy draw his breath, the shoulders were raised, that is to say, the scapulse were drawn up, were fixed, .and became the points from which the broad muscles of the chest diverged towards the ribs, to draw and expand them in respiration. We would do well to re- member this double office of the scapula and its muscles, that, whilst it is the very foundation of the bones of the upper extremity, and never wanting in any animal that has the most remote resemblance to an arm, it is the centre and point d'appui of the muscles of respiration, and acts, in that capacity, where there are no extremities at all! * We perceive that it is only in certain classes of animals, that the scapula is joined to the trunk * Some curious facts illustrative of this office of the muscles of the arm situated on the chest are stated in the author's paper on the Voice, in the Philosophical Transactions. 1832.

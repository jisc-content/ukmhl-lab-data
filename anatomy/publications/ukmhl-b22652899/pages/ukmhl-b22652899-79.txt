These bones forming the shoulder, therefore, require ad- ditional carpentry; or they must be laid together on a new principle. In the batracliian order,* for example in the frog, the thorax, as constituted of ribs, has disappeared ; the mechanism of respira- tion is altogether different from what it is in the mammalia. Accordingly, we find that the bones of the shoulder are on a new model; they form a broad and flat circle,! sufficient to give secure attachment to the extremity, and affording a large space for the lodgement of the muscles which move the arm. Perhaps the best ex- ample of this structure is in the siren and pro- teus; where the ribs are reduced to a very few imperfect processes, attached to the anterior dorsal vertebrae; and where the bones of the * See the Appendix under the 3rd Class of Vertebrata, Reptiles. t The Scapula, Clavicle, Sternum, and Coracoid bone may be recognised in this figure of the bones of a Frog.

FOSSIL ANIMALS SUITED TO says,) happen not to be within a leap, the spider would move towards it, so softly, that its motion seemed not more perceptible than that of the shadow of the gnomon of a dial."* I would only remark further on these motions of the muscles of animals, that we are not to account this slowness a defect, but rather an appropriation of muscular power. Since in some animals the same muscles which move their members so as to be hardly perceptible, can at another time move with the velocity of a spring. Now BulFon, speaking of the extinct species of the tardigrade family, considers them as monsters by defect of organization : as attempts of nature in which she has failed to perfect her plan : that she has produced animals which must have lived miserably, and which are effaced as failures from the list of living beings. The Baron Cuvier does not express himself more favorably when he says of the existing species, that they have so little resemblance to the organization of animals * The passage continues—" if the intended prey moved, the spider would keep pace with it exactly as if they were actuated by one spirit, moving backwards, forwards, or on each side with- out turning. When the fly took wing, and pitched itself behind the huntress, she turned round with the swiftness of thought, and always kept her head towards it, though to all appearance as immoveable as one of the nails driven into the wood on which was her station ; till at last, being arrived within due distance, swift as lightning sht made the fatal leap, and secured her prey."—Evelyn, as quoted by Kirby and Spence.

270 VARIATIONS IN THE CENTRE longed to an hyaena: although its proportions were double those of the corresponding parts of the living animal. First, the high spine showed the strength of the neck ; secondly, the depth and extent of the fossa or hollow for the lodgment of the temporal muscle proved that there was a remarkable mass, and consequent strength of muscle for closing the jaws ; thirdly, it belonged neither to the bear nor to the tiger, which was shown by the extraordinary thickness and den- sity of the whole bone. In this last respect, the portion of bone corresponded with no animal but the hyaena ; for the skull of the hyaena parti- cipates in the strength which is so remarkable in its teeth ; these being capable of breaking the strongest bones.* On this subject, Dr. Buckland has given an example of deduction, founded on the structure of the teeth of the hyaena, not inferior to the best specimen of Cuvier s reasoning on the fossil bones. In lecturing on the comparative anatomy of the skeleton, I put the subject in this light:â€”" We have seen that all nature is full of life; and where food is to be obtained, there are animals in structure suited to reach it. Suppose that the horse is run down by the wolf, and fed upon by the lesser carnivorous animals * This specimen is in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and is beautifully drawn in Mr. Ciift's paper in the Philosophical Transactions.

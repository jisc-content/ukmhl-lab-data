MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF BONE. 'i^y bone is chietiy on the anterior part: and tliere is no doubt that if the tibia were a perfect cylinder, it would be subject to fracture even from the mere force of the body itself being- thrown upon it. But if the column be stronger in proportion as the material is distant from the centre, we readily perceive how an anterior spine, or ridge, should be thrown out: and if we attend to the internal structure of that spine, we shall find that it is much denser and stronger than the rest of the bone. We cannot, here, deem either the form or the density of this ridge, a thing of accident; since it so perfectly corresponds with the experiment of Du Haniel which we have described, where the dense piece of wood being let into the piece of timber, was found to be a means of resisting transverse fracture. If we proceed, with the knowledge of these facts, to the examination of the different bones of the skeleton, we shall find that every where the form has a strict relation either to the motion to be performed, or the strain to which the bone is most exposed. In comparing the true bones with the cover- ings of the insects, we observed the necessity for the porous structure of the former. If it be necessary that the bone shall be very dense, it will, in that case, no longer be possessed of the power of re-union or re-production when it breaks: it will not re-unite upon being fractured, and if

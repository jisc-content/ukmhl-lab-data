VARIATIONS IN THK CENTRE consequently, tlirongli >vliicli it is transmitted. Hence it follows that when we possess a portion of the bones of the face, with the attached tooth of the mastodon, we can infer, by the greater size of this hole or foramen, that the nerve sup- plied more than the lipsâ€”that the animal had a proboscis, and was a species of elephant. It has been more lately discovered by our con- servator in the College of Surgeons, Mr. Clift, that judging by the teeth, and including in the survey the extinct as well as the living animals, there was a regular series, from the Asiatic ele- phant to the mastodon of the Ohio. If we con- sider that tooth to be the most perfect, which is most capable of resisting attrition, either from the mode of its growth or its structure, we shall begin with the great Asiatic elephant. The grinding tooth of this animal consists of alter- nate layers of the ivory and enamel, and from the closeness with which these parts are laid together, of a third portion, called crusta petrosa. The tooth of the African elephant is easily dis- tinguished, by the wide interstices between the layers of enamel. On the banks of the Irawadi, the tooth of a new species of mastodon is found, where the mammillary processes are so high, and the interstices are so deep that if a section be made of it, it resembles the tooth of the African elephant, and stands intermediate be- tween that and the mastodon giganteuin of North America.

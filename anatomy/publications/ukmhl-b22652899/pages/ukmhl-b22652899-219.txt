At one time, I entertained a doubt whether this proceeded from a knowledge of the condition of the muscles or from a conscious- ness of the degree of eftbrt which was directed to them in volition. It was with a view to elucidate this, that I made the observations which termi- nated in the discovery that every muscle had two nerves—one for sensation, and one to convey the mandate of the will and direct its action. I had reasoned in this manner—we awake with a knowledge of the position of our limbs: this cannot be from a recollection of the action which placed them where they are ; it must, therefore, be a consciousness of their present condition. When a person in these circumstances moves, he has a determined object; and he must be con- scious of a previous condition before he can desire a change or direct a movement. After a limb has been removed by the sur- geon, the person still feels pain, and heat, and cold in it.

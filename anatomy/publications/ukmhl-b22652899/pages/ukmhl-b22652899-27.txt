INTRODUCTOKV CHAPTER. / admiration should fix on the fact, that this small organ, the eye, is formed with relation to a creation of such vast extent and grandeur :â€”and more especially, that the ideas arising in the mind through the influence of that matter and this organ, are constituted a part of this vast whole! By such considerations we are led to contem- plate the human body in its different relations. The magnitude of the earth determines the strength of our bones, and the power of our muscles; so must the depth of the atmosphere determine the condition of our fluids, and the resistance of our blood vessels ; the connnon act of breathing, the transpiration from the surfaces, must bear relation to the weight, moisture, and temperature of the medium which surrounds us. A moment's reflection on these facts proves to us that our body is formed with a just correspondence to all these external influences. These views lead us to another consideration, that the complexity, of our structure belongs to external nature, and not of necessity to the mind. Whilst man is an agent in a material world, and sensible to the influence of things external, complexity of structure is a necessary part of his constitution. But we do not perceive a relation between this complexity and the mind. From ,aught that we learn, by this mode of study, the mind may be as distinct from the bodily organs as are the exterior influences which give them exercise.

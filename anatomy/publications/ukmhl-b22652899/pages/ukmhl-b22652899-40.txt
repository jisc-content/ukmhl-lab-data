But the ribs do not move of themselves, they must have appropriate muscles ; and these muscles must have their appropriate nerves : and for supplying these nerves there must be a spinal marrow. The spinal canal is as necessary to the spinal marrow as the skull is to the brain. So that we come round to under- stand the necessity of a vertebra* to the formation of the spinal marrow; and the reader may com- prehend how much enters into the conception of the anatomist or naturalist, when the term is used, a vertebrated animal, viz :—an internal skeleton, a particular arrangement of respiratory organs, and a conformity in the nervous sj stem. It is to this superior division that I shall limit myself, in making a review of the bones of the upper extremity. Were I to indulge in the admiration naturally arising out of this subject, and point out the strength and the freedom of motion in the upper extremity at the ball and socket joint of the shoulder,—the firmness of the articulation of the elbow, and yet how admirably it is suited to the co-operation of the hands,—the fineness of the motion of the hand itself, divided among the * Vertebra is the name given to the individual bones of the spine, or back-bone.

VARIATIONS IN THE CENTRE comprehend something of his habits; and see what must be the direction of his strength. He feeds by digging up roots, and the instruments by which he does this, are also those of his defence. The position of the tusk defends the eye in rushing through the underwood ; and the formation of the skull and of the spine and the mass of muscle in the neck, all show the inten- tion that he shall drive onv/ard with his whole weight and strength, so that he may rend with his tusks. Accordingly, we see that the back part of the skull rises in remarkable spines or ridjjes for the attachment of muscles, and that corresponding with these, the spinous processes of the vertebrae of the neck and back are of extraordinary length and strength. These pro- ^ cesses distinctly indicate the power of the muscles which pass from the neck to the head. We now understand the reason of the shortness and inflexibility of the neck : because the power with part of the skull exposed. The tusks show what a formidable animal it has been. That which rises out of the upper jaw is of great size, and we must admire the manner in which the tusk of the lower jaw closes upon that of the upper one so as to strengthen it near its root. The great size and sharpness of these tusks illustrate what is offered in the textâ€” that the main strength of the animal must be directed towards them. The rising of the back .of the head will be seen to cor- respond with the great height and strength of the spinous pro- cesses of the back exhibited in the next figure, of the wild boar of Germany.

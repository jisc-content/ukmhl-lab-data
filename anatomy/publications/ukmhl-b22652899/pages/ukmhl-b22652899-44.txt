24 ANIMALS THE MOST UNCOUTH for him or suited to his constitution, structure, or capacities. A skeleton is dug up which has lain under many fathoms of rock, being the bones of an animal which lived antecedent to that formation of rock, and at a time when the earth's surface must have been in a condition very different from what it is now. These remains prove, that all animals have been formed of the same ele- ments, and have had analogous organs—that they received new matter by digestion, and were nourished by means of a circulating fluid—that they possessed feeling through a nervous system, and were moved by the action of muscles—that their organs of digestion, circulation, and respi- ration were modified by circumstances, as in the animals now alive, and in accordance with their habits and modes of living. The changes in the organs are but variations in the great system by which new matter is assimilated to the animal body,—and however remarkable these may be, they always bear a certain relation to the ori- ginal type as parts of the same great design. In examining these bones of the ancient world, so regularly are they formed on the same prin- ciple which is evident in the animals now in- habiting the earth, that on observing their shape, and the processes* by which their muscles were * Processes are the projecting parts of bone by which the tendons of the muscles are attached. The processes, therefore, to the anatomist are indications of the conditions of the muscles.

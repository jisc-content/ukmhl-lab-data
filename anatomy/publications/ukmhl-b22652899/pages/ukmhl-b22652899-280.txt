VARIATIONS IN THE CENTRE 2G0 varies in its processes and articulations as they bear a reference to the skull: and that although this be the very central part of all, it varies in due degree, and is accommodated to the whole skeleton. What a complete contrast, then, there is between this animal and any of tlie feline tribe â€”a contrast of form and motion at once referrible to their spine. In the tiger or leopard, we see the perfect flexibility of the body, and a motion of the spine almost vermicular, corresponding with the teeth and jaws and the free motion of the paws. The peculiarity of form in the ele- phant has been happily illustrated by the cele- brated Cuvier: and the principle may be piu'- sued in a manner interesting both to the Natu- ralist and Geologist. We may feel in ourselves a projection of the spine between the shoulders which marks the process of the " vertebra prominensy When we stoop forward, as in reading a book which lies upon the table, we may feel a ligament extending from this process to the back of the head. It suspends the head and relieves the muscles. But as, for the most part, man carries his head balanced upon the extremity of the spine, or can vary its relation under fatigue, that suspensory ligament is not to be compared in strength with the corresponding part in quadrupeds; where from the horizontal position of the spine, the

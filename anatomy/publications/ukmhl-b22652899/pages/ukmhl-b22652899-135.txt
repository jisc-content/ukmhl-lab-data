THE ARM AND HAND. 115 velocity, equal to that of the body from which the impulse is originally given. The slight blow given to a boy's hoop is sufficient to keep it running; and just so the fly-wheel of a machine is kept in rapid action by a succession of impulses, each of which would hardly put it in motion. If we attempt to stop the wheel, it will give a blow in which a hundred lesser im- pulses are combined and multiplied. There is, in the machinery of the animal body, in a lesser degree, the same interchange of velocity and force. When a man strikes with a hammer, the muscle near the shoulder,* c, acts upon the humerus, b., in raising the ex- tended lever of the arm and hammer, with every A. The scapula, or shoulder blade ; b. the humerus, or arm- bone; c. the deltoid muscle of the shoulder, arising from the shoulder-blade and clavicle, and inserted into the arm-bone; d. a muscle which draws the arm down, as in striking with a sword or hammer.

OF THE MUSCULAR SENSE. 203 cumber their wings and bring them to the surface of the water. Whether led to admire the won- derful power of instinct in these inferior crea- tures, or the property acquired by our own eye, we must acknowledge here a compound operation.* The impression of odours on the nerve of smelling is exactly what some would have us to believe the effect of light is on the nerve of vision ; and yet, the impression on the nerve of vision alone is sufficient, in their opinion, to inform us of all that we know through the eye. Now of the direction and distance from which odours come we are quite ignorant, until by turning the head and directing the nostrils, and moving this way and that, we make comparison, and discover on which side the smell is strongest on the sense. We can judge of the direction of sounds without turning the head, because the strength of vibration is unequal on the two sides of the head, and a comparison is thus made of the two impressions. But when a person is deaf in one ear the operation is difficult; he is often mistaken as to the direction of sounds, and he has more necessity to turn the head and to compare the position of the tube of the ear with the strength of the impressions. Accord- * In these instances a difficulty will readily occur to the reader; how does the fish judge of position, since the rays of light are refracted at the surface of the water ? Does instinct enable it to do this, or is it by experience ?

134 CHAPTER VI. THE ARGUMENT PURSUED FROM THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. So far as we have hitherto proceeded, by examin- ing objects in comparative anatomy which from their magnitude can not be misunderstood, we have been led to conclude that, independently of the system of parts marvellously combined to form the individual animal, there is another more comprehensive system, which embraces all animals; and which exhibits a certain uni- formity in the functions of life, however different in form or bulk the creatures may be, or to what- ever condition of the globe they may have been adapted. We have seen no accidental deviation or deformity, but every change has been for a purpose, and every part has had its just re- lation. We have witnessed all the varieties moulded to such a perfect accommodation, and the alterations produced by such minute degrees, that all notion of external and accidental agency must be rejected. We might carry our demonstration downward through the lower classes of animals; for example,

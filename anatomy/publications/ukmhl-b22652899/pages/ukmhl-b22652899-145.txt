RIGHT HAND OVER THE LEFT. 125 awkwardness in the public exhibition; for if these exercises be neglected, an ungraceful pre- ference will be given to the right side. In walk- ing behind a person, it is very seldom that we see an equalized motion of the body ; and if we look to the left foot, we shall find that the tread is not so firm upon it, that the toe is not so much turned out as in the right, and that a greater push is made with it. From the peculiar form of woman, and the elasticity of her step resulting more from the motion of the ankle than of the haunches, the defect of the left foot when it exists, is more apparent in her gait. No boy hops upon his left foot, unless he be left handed. The horseman puts the left foot in the stirrup and springs from the right. We think we may conclude, that every thing being adapted, in the conveniences of life, to the right hand, as for example the direction of the worm of the screw or of the cutting end of the augur, is not arbitrary, but is related to a natural endowment of the body. He who is left handed is most sensible to the ad- vantages of this adaptation, from the opening of the parlour door to the opening of a pen-knife. On the whole, the preference of the right hand is not the effect of habit, but is a natural pro- vision, and is bestowed for a very obvious pur- pose : and the property does not depend on the peculiar distribution of the arteries of the arm but the preference is given to the right foot, as well as to the right hand.

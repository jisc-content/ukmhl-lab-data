Without a sense of muscular action or a consciousness of the degree of effort made, the proper sense of touch could hardly be an inlet to knowledge at all. I am now to show that the motion of the hand and fingers, and the sense or consciousness of their action, must be combined with the sense of touch, properly so called, before we can ascribe to it the influence which it possesses over the other organs. In my general course of lectures on anatomy, I ventured on this explanation from the com- mencement ; much doubting, however, the cor- rectness of my reasoning, from seeing that the great authorities on this subject made no account of the knowledge derived from the motions of our own frame. I called this consciousness of muscular exertion a sixth sense; considering it as essential to the exercise of the sense of touch. I can now refer, in confirmation of this view, to the works of philosophers who have been edu- cated to medicine; and to whom the necessity of the combination of the two faculties had suggested itself as it had to me.* Those dis- tinctions were connected with my enquiries into the functions of the nervous system, and in some measure directed them.-j * See Dr. Brown's Lectures on Moral Philosophy. t It was this convictionâ€”that we are sensible of the action of the muscles, which led me to the investigation of their nerves; first, by anatomy, and then by experiment. I was finally enabled

THEORY OF 142 tains to our subject, as it is the organ of pre- hension and of touch. It is withal a fly trap— hence, its motions must be rapid : and the velocity is increased by the most obvious means ima- ginable,—that is, by giving motion to both man- dibles, instead of to one. When a dog snaps, he throws back his head, and thereby raises the upper jaw at the same time that the lower jaw is dropped ; but these are slow and clumsy motions, pertaining to the muscles of the neck as well as of the jaws, and the poor hound makes many attempts, before he catches the fly that teazes him. But a swallow or fly-catcher makes no second effort, so admirably suited is the appara- tus of prehension to the liveliness of the eye and the instinct. The adaptation of the instrument consists in this, that the muscles which open the lower mandible, by the same effort, open the upper one : a. is a process of the lower mandible, projecting behind the centre of motion, and the muscle which is attached to it, opens the bill;—but at the same time, the lower mandible

58 BONES OF THE SHOULDER ^ Were we to compare the bones of these larger animals with any form of architecture, we might say it was the Egyptian, or rather like the Cyclopean walls of some ancient city; they are huge and shapeless, and piled over each other, as if they were destined more to sustain the weight, than to permit motion. We farther perceive, from the comparison of these sketches, that if the humerus be placed obliquely, it must necessarily be short, otherwise it would throw the leg too far back, and make the head and neck project. It is one of the " points" of a horse to have the humerus short. And not only have all animals of speed this character, but birds of long flight, as the swallow, have short humeri. This is owing, I think, to another circumstance, that in the wing, the short hume- rus causes a quicker extension ; for the further extremity of the bone moving in a lesser circle, makes the gyration be more rapid. If we take the bones of the shoulder as a distinct sut)ject, and trace them comparatively, we shall'' be led to notice some very curious modifications in them. We have already seen that there are two objects to be attained in the construction of these bones. In man, and mam- malia, they constitute an important part of the organ of respiration; and they conform to the structure of the thorax. But we shall find that in some animals, this function is in a manner with-

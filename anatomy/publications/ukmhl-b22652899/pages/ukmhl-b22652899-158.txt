138 THEORY OF shall show that the system is untenable. In the meantime, we may ask, do additional parts con- nected with the stomach, making it highly com- plex, as in ruminating animals, shorten the in- testinal canal, or make its form simpler ? On the contrary, is not a complex stomach necessarily connected with a long and complicated intestine ? Does a complex intestinal canal throughout all its course, render the solid viscera which are in juxtaposition to it imperfect? Is there any defect in them, because the organs of digestion are perfect or complicated? Does the complex heart imply a more simple, or a more perfect condition of the lungs? In short, as animals rise in the scale of existence, do we not find that the systems of digestion, circulation, respiration, and sensation bear ever a proportional increase ? Is there any instance of an improvement in one organ thrusting another out of its place, or diminishing its volume ? Now, as to the osseous system, were we to follow these theorists into the very stronghold of their position, the bones of the skull, where the real intricacy of the parts allows them some scope for their ingenuity, we might show how untenable the principle is which they assume. But we must confine ourselves to our own subject. In the higher orders of the vertebrata, we find that the bones of the shoulder perform a double office ; that they have an important share in the

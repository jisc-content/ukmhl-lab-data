FOOT OF RUMINANTS. 91 •whilst the lateral parts and the heels expand under the pressure of the frog. That there is a relation between the internal structure and the covering, whether it be the nail, or crust, or hoof, we can hardly doubt: and an unexpected proof of this offers itself in the horse. There are some very rare instances of a horse having digital extremities. According to Sue- tonius, there was such an animal in the stables of Caesar ; another was in the possession of Leo X.; and Geoffrey St. Hilaire, in addition to those, says, that he has seen a horse with three toes on the fore-foot, and four on the hind-foot.* These instances of deviation in the natural structure of the bones were accompa- nied with a corresponding change in the cover- ings—the toes had nails, not hoofs. By these examples, it is made to appear still more distinctly that there is a relation between the internal configuration of the toes and their coverings—that when there are five toes com- plete in their bones, they are provided with per- fect nails—when two toes represent the whole, as in the cleft foot of the ruminant, there are appropriate horny coverings—and that when the bones are joined to form the pastern bones and coffin bone, there is a hoof or crust, as in the horse, couagga, zebra, and ass. * Such a horse was not long since exhibited in Town, and at Newmarket.

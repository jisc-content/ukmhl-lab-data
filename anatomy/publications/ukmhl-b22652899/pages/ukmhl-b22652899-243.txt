AND SUCCESSIVE EPOCHS. -:^^> the general surface, and the proofs of these changes are as distinct as the furrows on a field are indicative that the plough has passed over it. The deeper parts of the crust of the earth and the animal remains imbedded, also give proofs that in the course of these revolutions there have been long periods or epochs. In short, progressive changes, from the lowest to the highest state of existence, of organization and of enjoyment, point to the great truth that there was a beginning. When the geologist sees a succession of stratified rocks—the lowest simple, or perhaps chemical; the strata above these, compound; and others more conglomerated, or more dis- tinctly composed of the fragments of the former —it is not easy to contradict the hypothesis of an eternal succession of causes. But there is nothing like this in the animal body; the ma- ' terial is the same in all, the general design too is the same : but each family, as it is created, is submitted to such new and fundamental arrangements in its construction as implies the presence of the hand of the Creator. There is nothing in the inspection of the spe- cies of animals, which countenances the notion of a return of the world to any former condition. When we acknowledge that animals have been created in succession and with an increasing complexity of parts, we are not to be understood

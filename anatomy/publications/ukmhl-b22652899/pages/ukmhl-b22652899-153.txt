SUBSTITUTES FOR THE HAND. 133 section, that a branch of the fifth nerve, remark- ably developed, is distributed on the upper man- dible. Animals feel in the whole of their exter- nal surface; and we may say that serpents, by coiling themselves round a body, have the organ of touch all over them. Still the fifth pair of nerves in the head, or the nerve analogous to it, is the main instrinnent of touch in the greater number of animals where extremities are wanting. There are organs varying in their conformation, some- times delicate palpa, sometimes horny rods, and these are often possessed of muscularity as well as sensibility; but to all, the sense of touch is bestowed through a nerve corresponding with the fifth pair, the nerve of the tongue and lips, and of the muscles of the jaws in man. But we may repeat, that, necessary as these appendages and this sensibility are to the ex- istence of these animals, their imperfections serve, by contrast, to show how happily the dif- ferent properties are combined in the hand; in which we perceive the sensibilities to changes of temperature, to touch, and to motion, united with a facihty in the joints of unfolding and moving in every possible degree and direction, without abruptness or angularity, and in a manner inimitable by any artifice of joints and levers.

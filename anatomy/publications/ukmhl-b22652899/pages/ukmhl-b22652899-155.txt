COMPARATIVE ANATOMY PURSUED. l.iO we mio'ht trace the feet of insects from their most perfect or complex stitte, till they disappear; or, observing the changes in another direction, we might follow out the same parts from the smallest beginning to the most perfect condition of the member, where we see the thigh, leg, and tarsus of the fly. We might distinguish them at first as the fine cirri, like minute bristles, which, on the bodies of Avorms take sliglit hold of the surface over which they creep. In the sea mouse, (aplirodita) we might notice these bristles standing out from distinct mammillary processes, which are furnished with appropriate nmscles. Then in the mynapodes, the first order of insects, we might see the same " many feet," and each foot having a distinct articulation. From that, we might pass to the feet of those insects, where there is a thigh, leg, and foot, with the most perfect system of flexors, extensors, and adductor muscles, possessing, in fine, all that we most admire in the human anatomy. Nay, it is more curious to observe how the feet of the true insects are again changed or modified, taking new offices, the anterior feet becoming feelers, organs of prehension, or hands. When, with such an object, we view the delicate and curiously adapted instruments of insects, we must perceive that it would be easy to trace almost every part through a succession of modifications. Among the vertebrata, we have seen the hand become a

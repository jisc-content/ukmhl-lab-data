2o(3 OF THE FORM AND POSITION them, vary in their processes or shapes, and in their relations. Pursuing this idea, we shall be able to account for the characteristic forms of the larger quadrupeds. The principle, then, which will guide us here, as it Avill, indeed, in a more universal survey of animal nature, is, that the organization varies with the condition or the circumstances in which the animals are placed—that they may feed and multiply. If we take into consideration any of the great functions on which life dej^ends, Ave shall perceive that the apparatus, or the mode of action of the parts is altered and adapted to every changing circumstance. Digestion, for example, is the same in all animals ; but there is an interesting variety in the organization: and the stomach will vary in its form and in the number of its cavities, according to the food received, in the quadruped, or bird, or fish, or insect—a variation not depending upon the size or form of the animal, but adapted purely to the conversion of its particular food into nourish- ment. We shall find the gizzard in a fish or in an insect, as perfect as in the fowl. So the de- carbonization of the blood is the same process in all living animals: but the mode in which the respiration is performed varies according to cir- cumstances; and the apparatus is especially modified and adjusted to the atmosphere or to the water. But although the organs subservient to the

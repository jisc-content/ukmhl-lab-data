This informs us that sensibility is not a necessary attendant on the delicate tex- ture of a living part, but that it must have an appropriate organ, and that it is an especial provision.* To satisfy my reader on this interesting sub- ject, I shall take the contrast of two organs, one external and exposed, and the other internal and carefully excluded from injury. The eye, consisting of its proper nerve of vision and its transparent humours and coats, is an organ of exquisite delicacyâ€”not only is it exposed to all the injuries to which the general surface of the body is liable, but to be inflamed and rendered opaque by particles getting into it which are so light that they float in the atmos- phere, and to the contact of which the common skin is quite insensible. The mechanical, and more obvious contrivance for the protection of this organ, is a ready motion of the eyelids and the shedding of tears ; which coming, as it were, from a little fountain, play over the surface of the eye, and wash away whatever is offensive. But to the action of this little hydraulic and mechanical apparatus there is required an ex- * See the Sensibility of the Retina, " Additional Illustrations."

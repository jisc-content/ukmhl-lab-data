148 THESi: THEORIES INCORRECT. rected to the wings instead of the feet, is now visible; and a new distribution of nerves is dis- tinctly to be traced, accommodated to the parts which are now to be put in motion. Here is no budding and stretching forth under the influence of the surrounding elements; but a change operated on all the economy, and prospective, that is, in reference to a condition which the creature has not yet attained. These facts countenance the conclusion drawn from the comparative anatomy of the hand and armâ€”that with each new instrument, visible ex- ternally, there are a thousand internal relations established: a mechanical contrivance in the bones and joints, wdiich alters every part of the skeleton: an arrangement of riiuscles, in just correspondence: a new and appropriate texture of nervous filaments, which is laid intermediate between the instrument and the very centre of life and motion; and, finally, as we shall discover from what follows, new sources of activity must be created in relation to the new organ, otherwise the part will hang a useless appendage. It must now be apparent that nothing less than the Power, which originally created, is equal to the effecting of those changes on animals, which are to adapt them to their conditions : that their organization is predetermined, and not conse- quent on the condition of the earth or the sur-

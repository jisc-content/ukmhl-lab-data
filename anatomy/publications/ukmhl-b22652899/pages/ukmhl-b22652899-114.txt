94 CONTRAST OF THE he stands, resembles the base of a pillar, or the lower part of the trunk of a stately tree. But when W'e examine the bones of the foot, we find this broad base to consist of the carpus, meta- carpus, and phalanges of the toes; and these bones have a very different use from what we have hitherto noticed. They are not connected with a moveable radius, and have no individual motion, as in the carnivorous animalâ€”they merely serve to expand the foot, the base of the column, and to give it a certain elasticity. In the sketch (page 57) I have placed the bones of the foot of the camel in contrast with those of the elephant. The camel's foot having no such disproportioned weight to bear as in the elephant, lightness of motion is secured by the oblique position of its bones, as well as by the direction of the bones of the shoulder, which we have formerly noticed. In the soft texture of the camel's foot there is much to admire; for although the bottom be flat, like the sole of a shoe, yet there is between it and the bones and tendons a cushion so soft and elastic that the animal treads with great lightness and security. The resemblance of the foot of the ostrich to that of the camel has not escaped naturalists. We are now treating of the last bones of the toes; and let us once more see what may be done, by the study of one of these bones, to the bodying forth of the whole animal. I allude to

THE ARM AND HAND. 113 Other; so that the property of life, which we call the irritability, or action of a muscle, is upon the whole, less exhausted than would be the case on any other supposition. As to the second head, our demonstration is of an easier kind. We have said that nature bestows abundantly, but not superfluously; a truth evinced in the arrangement of the muscles. All the muscles of the limbs have their fibres running in an oblique direction,â€”thus A. being the tendinous origin of a muscle, and b. the tendinous insertion, the fleshy fibres run ob- v liquely between these two tendons. A The fibre acting thus obliquely loses power, but gains the property of pulling what is attached to its further extremity through a greater space, while it contracts; and consequently the velo- city is increased. This mechanical arrange- ment is intelligible on the law, that velocity of motion through space, is equal to power or .weight. Here in the muscle, there is a resig- nation of power to obtain velocity of motion. The same effect is produced by the manner in which the tendons of the nmscles run over the joints. They would act more powerfully, if they went in a straight line to the toes or tips of the I

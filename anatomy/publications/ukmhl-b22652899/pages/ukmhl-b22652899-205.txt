ORGAN OF TOUCH. 1<^Â»> in which the nerves enter the hoof, we have, in fact, a magnified view of that which exists, but is only more minute and deUcate, in the cuticuhir covering of the fingers. We may take the horse s foot as the example. When the crust or hoof, which is insensible, is separated from the living part, we see small villi* hanging from the vascu- lar surface, and which have been withdrawn from the crust; looking to the inside of the crust, we perceive the pores from which these villi have been pulled. These processes of the living sur- face are not merely extremities of nerves; they consist of the nerves and the necessary accom- paniment of membrane and bloodvessels, on a very minute scale. For it must be remembered that nerves can perform no function unless sup- plied with blood, all qualities of life being sup- ported through the circidating blood. These nerves, so prolonged into the hoof, receive the vibrations of that body. By this means the horse is sensible to the motion and pressure of its foot, or to its percussion against the ground ; and without this provision, there would be a certain imperfection in the limb. In a former part of this treatise I have shewn by what curious mechanism the horse's foot is made yielding and elastic, for the purpose of bearing the percussion against the ground. But * Villi, delicate tufts, like the pile of velvet, projecting from the surface of any membrane.

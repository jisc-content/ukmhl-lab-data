BONES OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS. J05 College of Surgeons, of fossil animals of singular structure, between the crocodile and the fish. They are in a calcareous rock, and the skeletons are entire, but crushed, and a good deal dis- figured. Here are the extremities or paddles, consisting of a multitude of bones articulated; and among these we still discover the humerus, radius and ulna, and bones of the carpus and fingers. No fault is to be found with the con- struction of these instrinnents ; they are suited to their offices, and no bone is superfluous, or misplaced, or imperfect. The ichthyosaurus and plesiosaurus (the animals which offer these speci- mens) inhabited the sea; their remains are found low in the lias deposit; great changes have been w rought on the land and on the deep since they existed; and the race of animals, the structure of whose extremities we have been engaged in examining, was not then in being. When we discover the same series of bones in the we see the intermediate changes from the foot of animals to the fin of the fish—from the walrus, dolphin, turtle, to the ple- siosaurus, and ichthyosaurus—where we no longer find the phalanges or attempt to count the bones. They become irregular polygons or trapezoids—less like phalanges than the radii of the fins of a fish. In fishes the anterior extremity is recognised in the thoracic fin ; and we may even discover the prototypes of the scapula and the bones of the arm connected with it. I know not what the naturalist, who likes to note the gradual decrease of the elementary parts, makes of these hun- dred bones of the paddle or of the fin ; where there is an increase of the number, whilst, relatively speaking, there is a defect in the form and motion, of the parts.

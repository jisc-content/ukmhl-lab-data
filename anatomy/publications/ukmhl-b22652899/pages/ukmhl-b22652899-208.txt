ORGAN OF TOUCH. 188 to have invested it with a succession of solid and dead layers of cuticle. This would have been the case had the cuticle been merely thickened by pressure, and had there been no design to make a provision adapted in all respects to the habits of the bird. Such, then, is the structure of the organ of touch : obvious in the extremities of the fingers; magnified in the foot of the horse or of the ostrich ; and existing even in the delicate skin of the lips. I have casually noticed that increased vascu- larity is always an accompaniment of nerves, and necessary to the sensibility of a part. In the museum of the College of Surgeons we see that Mr. Hunter had taken the pains to demonstrate this, by the injection of the blood- vessels of a slug. Although fluid was injected from its heart, the blush from the vermilion ex- tends over its foot; the foot, in these gasteropoda, being the whole lower flat surface on which the animal creeps. This surface is also the organ of touch, by which it feels and directs its motions. It is on the same principle, if w^e may compare such things, that we explain the rosy tipped fingers and the ruby lips, which imply fine sen- sibility combined with high vascularity. Having described the relation of the cuticle to the nerves of touch, we may take notice of another quality, its roughness, and of the ad-

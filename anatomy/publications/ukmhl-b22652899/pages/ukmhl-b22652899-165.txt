We shall presently find that an opinion has prevailed that the oi-ganization of animals has determined their propensities; but the philosophers, of whom we are now speaking, imagine the contrary,—that under the influence of new circumstances, organs have accommo- dated themselves, and assumed their particular forms. It must be here remarked that there are no instances of the production of new organs by the union of individuals belonging to different species. Nor is there any foundation in observation for the opinion that a new species may be formed by the union of individuals of different families. But it is contended, that, although the species of animals have not changed in the last 5000 years, we do not know what might have been the effect of the revolution before that time; that is, pre- vious to the present condition of the world. On subjects of this nature, however, we must argue from what we know, and from what we see. We do perceive surprising changes in the conformation of animals. Some of them are very familiar to us; but all show a foreknowledge and a prospective plan,—an alteration gradually taking place in preparation for the condition, L

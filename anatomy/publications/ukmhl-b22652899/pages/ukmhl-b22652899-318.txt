298 COMPARISON OF THE EVE receive sensation from an opposite colour. All the colours of the prism come into the eye from the surface of the white paper when the wafer is removed; but if the nerve has been ex- hausted by the incidence of the red rays upon it, it will be insensible to these red rays when they are thus reflected from the paper; the effect of the rays of an opposite kind will be increased, and consequently the spot will be no longer white, but of the prevailing green colour. Let us see how the loss of sensibility produces an effect in engraving, where there is no colour, and only light and shade. Is it possible that a high tower, in a cloudless sky, can be less illuminated at the top than at the bottom ? Yet if we turn to a book of engravings, where an old steeple or tower is represented standing up against the clear sky, we shall find that all the higher part is dark, and that the effect is picturesque and pleasing. Now this is per- fectly correct, for although the highest part of the tower be in the brightest illumination, it is not seen soâ€”it never appears so to the eye. The reason is, that when we look to the steeple, a great part of the retina is opposed to the light of the sky; and on shifting the eye to look at the particular parts of the steeple, the reflected light from that object falls upon the retina, where it is exhausted by the direct light of the sky. If we

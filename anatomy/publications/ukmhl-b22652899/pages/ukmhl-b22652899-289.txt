AND IN THE EXTREMITIES. there seems to be a due proportion between the legs and the neck, yet he is not suited to browse the grass, but to feed on the high branches of trees. In the attempt to reach the ground with his mouth the limbs appear to be in danger of suffering dislocation. He extends his feet late- rally, elevates the scapula^, draws in the crupper, and stretches the neck, so as to present a very ludicrous figure. Although the changes in the shape of the skulls of animals are principally forwards, yet the slighter deviations in the back part may in- dicate much, if minutely scanned. For example, a portion of a skull was found, among other inte- resting specimens of fossil bones, in the caves near Plymouth. It consisted merely of the condyles or articulating processes of the skull which join it to the vertebrae of the neck, and a portion of the occipital and temporal bones. Yet from these it could be ascertained that the fragment be- is appended to a short neck; in the shortness of the legs also we see the correspondence that we have had occasion to remark between the position of the head and the height of the trunk from the ground. The camel is, in every respect, a contrast. It must have rapidity and ease of motion; that is secured by the length of the extremities ; and according with the extremities, are tlie length of the neck and the lightness of the head. Here is a skeleton, then, of an animal which is properly terrestrial, accom- modated to all the peculiarities of its organization, and adapted for a rapid and long continued course : the hippopotamus, on the other hand, seeks its safety in the water,â€”and its uncouth form and weight are suited to that element.

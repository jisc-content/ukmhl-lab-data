THEORY OF 136 wing or a fin; so might we trace the wings of insects. If we begin with a fly, which has two delicate and perfect wings incased and protected, we find that the covers are raised to admit the expansion of the wings. In another, the case becomes a wing; and the fly is characterized by four wings. Proceeding to examine a third example, we shall discover that this anterior wing is larger and more perfect than the pos- terior : the fourth specimen has lost the pos- terior wings, and has only two perfect ones ; and if we continue the examination, the next speci- men will present an insect deprived of wings alto- gether. These are not freaks of nature, but new forms of the body; new appendages required for a different poising of the fly in its flight. They are adaptations in that regular series which we have observed to obtain in the larger animals, and where the intention can not be mistaken. A very natural question will force itself upon us, how are those varieties to be ex- plained? The curious adaptation of a member to dif- ferent offices and to different conditions of the animal has led to a very extraordinary opinion in the present day,â€”that all animals consist of the same elements. It would be just to say that they consist of the same chemical elements, and that they attract and assimilate matter by the performance of the same vital functions, through

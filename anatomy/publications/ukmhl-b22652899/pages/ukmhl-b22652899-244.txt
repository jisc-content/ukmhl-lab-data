224 COMPARISON OF SOME PARTS OF THE as admitting that there is here proof of a growing maturity of power, or an increasing effbrt in the Creator: and for this very plain reason, which we have stated before, that the bestowing of life or the union of the vital principle with the mate- rial body, is the manifestation of a power superior to that displayed in the formation of an organ or the combination of many organs, or construction of the most complex mechanism. It is not, therefore, a greater power that we see in opera- tion, but a power manifesting itself in the perfect and successive adaptation of one thing to another—of vitality and organization to inor- ganic matter. In contemplating the chain of animal creation, "we observe that even now there are parts of the earth's surface which are marshy, and insalu- brious ; and that these are the places inhabited by amphibious and web-footed animals,—such as are suited to the oozy margins of swamps, lakes, or estuaries. It is most interesting to find that when the remains of animals, of similar construction, are found in the solid rocks, the geologist discovers, by other signs, that at the period of the formation of these rocks, the sur- face was flat, and that it produced such plants as imply a similar state of the earth to these swampy and unhealthy regions. We thus mark changes in the earth's surface, and observe, at the same time, corresponding

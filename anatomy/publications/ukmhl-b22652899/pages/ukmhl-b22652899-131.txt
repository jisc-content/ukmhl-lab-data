MUSCLES OF THE ARM AND HAND. 1 1 1 without a new position of the body, and a poising of it, through the action of a hundred muscles. ON THE ACTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ARM. We shall consider this subject under two heads ; in the first, we shall give examples of the living property of the muscles ; and then of the mechanical contrivances, in their form and appli- cation. In all that regards the muscles, we see the most bountiful supply of power commen- surate to the object, but never any thing in the least degree superabundant. If the limb is to be moved by bringing a muscle, or a set of muscles mto action, the power is not given in that excess which would enable them to overcome their op- ponents ; but the property of action is withdrawn from the opponents ; they become relaxed, and the muscles, which are in a state of contraction, perform their office with comparative ease. A stationary condition of the limb results from a balanced but regulated action of all the muscles; which condition may be called their tone. If, in an experiment, a weight be attached to the tendon of an extensor muscle, it will draw out that muscle to a certain degree, until its tone or per- manent state resists the weight: but if the flexor muscle be now excited, this being the natural opponenjt of the extensor, the weight will fall, by the relaxation of the extensor. So that the motion

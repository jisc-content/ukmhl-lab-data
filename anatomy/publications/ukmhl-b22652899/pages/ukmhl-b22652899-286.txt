2GG VARIATIONS IN THE CENTRE feeds off the sides of the rocks, and does not browse upon the herbage at its feet. A very remarkable proof of the incapacity of this animal to feed in the common way was afforded by an accident which befell a fine male specimen con- fined in the Zoological Gardens. To reach the ground on which his food M^as unintentionally scattered, he had to extend out his fore legs laterally ; in this position his foot slipped, he dis- located his shoulder, and died of the accident. Contrasted with the elk in a most remarkable manner, we have the giraffe ; which feeds upon the branches of lofty trees. The whole con- stitution and form of this animal is provided to enable it to reach highâ€”the fore legs are long, the neck still longer, the head is remarkably small and light, and the tongue has a power of elongation which no other quadruped pos- sesses. The tongue is, indeed, not inaptly com- pared with the trunk of the elephant; he can extend it seventeen inches, and he twists it about, so that it resembles a long black worm ; and it is used with extraordinary dexterity in picking up a straw as well as pulling down a branch. The anatomy of the bones of the giraffe is full of in- terest too, as showing the accommodation in the structure to the necessities of the animal's con- dition. And, first, of the head : if we have the skulls of the giraffe and of the camel or horse before us, we are struck with the delicacy

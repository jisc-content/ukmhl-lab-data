52 ANATOMY OF THE by bone, that is, through the medium of a cla- vicle ; and a slight depression on a process of the scapula, when discovered in a fossil state, will therefore declare to the geologist the class to which the animal belonged. For example, there are brought over to this country the bones of the Megatherium, an animal which must have been as large as the elephant; of the anterior extre- mity there is only the scapula; and on the end of the process, called acromion, of that bone, there is a mark of the attachment of a clavicle. This points out the whole constitution of the extremity, and that it enjoyed perfect freedom of motion. Other circumstances will declare whether that extensive motion was bestowed so that the animal might dig with its huge claws like some of the edentata, or strike like the feline tribe. Some interest is attached to the position of the scapula, in the horse. In him, and in other quad- rupeds, with the exceptions which I have made, there is no clavicle, and the connection between the extremity and the trunk is solely through muscles. That muscle called serratus magnus, which is a large one in man, is particularly powerful in the horse; for the weight of the trunk hangs upon this muscle. In the horse, as in most quadrupeds, the speed results from the strength of the loins and hinder extremities ; for it is the muscles there which propel the animal. But were the anterior extremities joined to the trunk firmly, and by bone, they could not with-

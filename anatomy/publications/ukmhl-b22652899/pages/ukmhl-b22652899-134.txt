1 14 OF THE MUSCLES OF fingers: but by being laced down in sheaths, they move the toes and fingers with a velocity proportioned to their loss of power. Let us see how far this corresponds with other mechanical contrivances. A certain power of wind or water being obtained, the machinery is moved; but it is desired to give a blow, with a velocity far greater than the motion of the water or the turning of the wheels. For this purpose a fly-wheel is put on, the spokes of which may be considered as long levers. The wheel moves very slowly, at first; but being once in motion, each impulse accelerates it with more and more facility ; at length, it acquires a rapidity, and a centrifugal force which nothing can equal in its effects, but the explosion of gunpowder. The mechanist not having calculated the power of accelerated motion in a heavy wheel, has seen his machinery split and burst up, and the walls of the house blown out as by the bursting of a bomb-shell. A body at rest receives an im- pulse from another, which puts it into motion- it receives a second blow ; now this second blow has much greater eff'ect than the first—for the power of the first was exhausted in changing the body from a state of rest to that of motion—but being in motion when it receives the second blow, the whole power is bestowed on the accele- ration of its motion ; and so on, by the third and fourth blows, until the body moves with a

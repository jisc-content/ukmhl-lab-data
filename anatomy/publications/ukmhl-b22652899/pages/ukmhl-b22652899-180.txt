A man having lost the sense of heat in his right hand, but retaining the muscular power, lifted the cover of a pan which had fallen into the fire and deliberately replaced it, not being conscious that it was burning hot ; the effect, however, was the death and destruction of the skin of the palm and fingers. In this man there was a continual sensation of coldness in the affected arm, which actual cold applied to the extremity did not aggravate, nor heat in any degree assuage.* Sensibility to heat is a safeguard in as much as it is capable of be- coming a painful sensation, whilst it is a never- failing excitement to activity and a continual source of enjoyment.

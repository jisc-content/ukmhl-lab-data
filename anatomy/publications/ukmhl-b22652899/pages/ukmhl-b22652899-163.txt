143 ELEMENTAL PARTS. presses upon the bone b., the os quadratum: now, there is attached to this bone, projecting forwards, with its anterior extremity fixed against the upper mandible, a shaft or process of bone c.; and this receives the pressure of the os quadratiun, when the muscle acts ; so that being thrust forwards, like a bolt, it opens the upper mandible, which moves upon the skull at d.* Here, then, is a piece of mechanism as distinct as the lock of a gun, which is for the purpose, as we have said, of giving rapidity to the motions of the bill. Is it nearer the truth to consider this as a new apparatus, suiting the necessities of the creature, or an accidental result of the introduc- tion of a bone, which in its proper office has nothing to do with the jaw? But we have wandered somewhat from our subject. We have before taken the bones of the shoulder, or those of the extremity which are nearest to the trunk ; we may pursue the inquiry by noticing those which are most remote from it. In the bones corresponding with those of the hand, we have seen that the same system was variously modified so as to be adapted to every possible change in office. But as it is insisted that the number of parts con- tinue the same, what can we say to the bones of the paddle in the saurian and chelonian tribes ? * There is another process of the os quadratum, which, directed more internally, assists in raising the upper mandible.

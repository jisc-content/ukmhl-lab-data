COMPARISON OF THE BONES 56 with the humerus, or arm bone, and, consequently, improves the effect of those muscles which pass from it to that bone. We have only to turn to the skeleton of the elephant, the ox, the elk, or the stag, to see the confirmation of this principle. When the scapula is oblique, the serratus muscle, which passes from the ribs to its uppermost part, has more power in rolling it. When it lies at right angles with the humerus, the muscles which are attached to the latter, (at B.) act with more effect. And on the same principle, by the oblique position of the humerus, and, consequently, its obliquity in reference to the radius and ulna, the two bones of the fore-arm, the power of the muscle inserted (at C.) into the olecranon, is in- creased. On the whole, both power and elas- ticity are gained by this position of the superior bones of the fore-leg. It gives to the animal that springs, a larger stretch in throwing himself for- wards, and security, in a soft descent of his weight. A man, standing upright, cannot leap or start off at once; he must first sink down, and bring the bones of his extremities to an angle. But the antelope, or other timid animals of the class, can leap at once, or start off in their course without preparation: another advantage of the oblique position of their bones when at rest. These sketches with the pen are from the skeletons of the elephant and the camel. The leg of the former is obviously built for the purpose of sustaining the huge bulk of the animal. >

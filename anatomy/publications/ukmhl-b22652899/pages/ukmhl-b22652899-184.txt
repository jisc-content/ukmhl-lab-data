In those cases, when vision gave notice of danger to the organ, the patient winked to avoid it, but when the point touched the eye or eyelids, the sense of touch gave no alarm, and was followed by no action for the protection of the organ. I shall present another instance of the pecu- liar nature of the sensibility which protects the eye. The Oculist has observed that by the touch of a thing as light as a feather, the muscles of the eye will be thrown into uncontrollable actions and spasms: but if the point of the finger be pressed somewhat rudely between the eyelids, and directly on the eye itself, he can by such means hold the eye steady for his intended operation, producing hardly any sensation, cer- tainly no pain!

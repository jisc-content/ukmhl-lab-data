ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE 248 let into the space, the strength will be increased; because the hardness of this piece of wood resists compression. This experiment I like the better because it explains a very interesting peculiarity in the different densities of the several parts or sides of the bones. In reading anatomical books, we are led to suppose that the various forms of the bones result from the pressure of the muscles which surround them. This is a mistake. Were we to consider this as the true explanation, it would not only be admitting an imperfection, but we should expect to find, if the bones yielded in any degree to the force of the muscles, that they would yield more and more, and be ultimately destroyed. There is nothing more admirable in the living frame than the relation established between the muscular power and the strength or capacity of passive resistance in the bones. The deviations from the cylindrical forms are not irregularities ; and if we take that bone which deviates the furthest from the cylindrical shape, the tibia, or shin bone, we shall have demonstra- tion of the correspondence between the shape of the bone and the force which it has to sustain. If we consider the direction of the force in w^alking, running, or leaping, and in all the powerful exertions where the weight of the body is thrown forwards on the ball of the great toe, it must appear that the pressure against the shin

ORGAN OF TOUCH. 190 nerves, wrapt up in delicate membrane with their accompanying arteries and veins, project from the true skin into corresponding grooves or fora- mina of the cuticle. They are not absolutely in contact with the cuticle, but are surrounded with a semi-fluid matter. By this fluid and by the cuticle they are protected, at the same time that they are sensible to the pressure made on the surface, and to cutting, pricking, and heat.* But this capacity, we repeat, is not owing, strictly speaking, to any thing in the structure of the organ, but to the appropriation of the nerve to this class of sensations. * It is a curious confirmation of the fact, that the cutaneous nerve is adapted to receive impressions from the varieties of tem- perature, that when disease takes place in the centre of the trunk of a nerve, or when the nerve is surrounded with diseased parts, the sensation of burning accompanies the pain ; and the patient refers this to the part of the skin to which the extreme branch of the nerve is distributed. By a burning sensation in the sole of the foot, I have been directed to the disease seated in the centre of the thigh.

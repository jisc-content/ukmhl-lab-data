APPENDIX. THE CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS. IN EXPLANATION OF THE TERMS INCIDENTALLY USED IN THE VOLUME. The Animal Kingdom is arranged in four Divisions: Division I. Vertebral Animals: so called from their pos- sessing a vertebral column or spine. Division II. Molluscous Animals : such as shell-fish, which are of a soft structure, and without a skeleton. Etym. mollis, soft. Division III. Articulated Animals: like the worm or insect: they are without a skeleton, but their skins or coverings are divided and jointed. Etym. Articulus, dim. a joint. Division IV. Zoophytes : animals believed to be composed very nearly of a homogeneous pulp, which is moveable and sensible, and resembles the form of a plant. Etym. l^utov, zoon, a living creature; <^vtov, phyton, a plant. DIVISION I. The division of vertebral animals is composed of four Classes: viz., 1. Mammalia, animals which suckle their young. Etym. mamma, a teat. 2. Aves. Etym. avis, a bird. 3. Reptilia, animals that crawl. Etym. from a part of the word repo, to creep. 4. Pisces. Etym. piscis, a fish. The first Class Mammalia, is divided into Orders, which are subdivided into Genera, and these are further divided into Species. We present the principal Orders with familiar examples. Bimana, man. Etym. bis, double; manus, hand.

MECHAxNICAL PROPERTIES OF BONE. iiO 1 processes, being remarkably large. Nothing can be conceived more clumsy than the bones of the megatherium. Hence it really appears that nature has exhausted her resources with respect to this material; and that living and vascular bone could not be moulded into a form to sustain the bulk and weight of an animal much superior to the elephant, mastodon, and megatherium * With regard to the articulation of the bones, we cannot mistake the reason of the surfaces of contact being enlarged. Now the advantage which is obtained from this expansion of the ends of the bones, is gained without the motion * The subject may be illustrated in this manner:—" A soft " stone projecting from a wall, may make a stile strong enough '* to bear a person's weight; but if it were necessary to double the " length of the stile, the thickness must be more than doubled, " or a freestone substituted; and were it necessary to make this *' freestone project twice as far from the wall, it would not be " strong enough to bear a proportioned increase of weight, even " if it were doubled in thickness : granite must be placed in its " stead ; and even the granite would not be capable of sustaining *' four times the weight which the soft stone bore in the first in- " stance. In the same way the stones which form an arch, of a " large span, must be of the hardest granite, or their own weight *' will crush them. The same principle is applicable to the bones *' of animals. The material of bone is too soft to admit an in- *' definite increase of weight; and it is another illustration of ** what was before stated, that there is a relation established through all nature : that the structure of the very animals " which move upon the surface of the earth is proportioned to " its magnitude, and the gravitation to its centre."—Animal Mechanics.

89 OF THE horse's FOOT. strated the anatomy of the horse's foot without finding something new to admire. The weight and power of the animal require that he should have a foot in which strength and elasticity are combined. The elasticity is essentially necessary to prevent percussion in striking the ground ; and it is attained here, through the united effect of the oblique posi- tion of the bones of the leg and footâ€”the yielding nature of the suspending ligament, and the expansibility of the crust or hoof. So much depends on the position of the pastern bones and coffin bone, that judging by the length of these and their obliquity, it is possible to say whether a horse goes easily, without mounting it. When the hoof is raised, it is smaller in its diameter, and the sole is concave; but when it bears on the ground it expands, the sole descends so as to become flatter; and this expansion of the hoof laterally, is necessary to the play of the whole structure of the foot. Hence it happens that if the shoe be nailed in such a manner as to prevent the hoof expanding, the whole interior contrivance for mobility and elasticity is lost. The foot, in trotting, comes down solid, it conse- quently suffers percussion ; and from the injury, it becomes inflamed and hot. From this in- flammation is generated a variety of diseases, which at length destroy all the beautiful pro- visions of the horse's foot for free and elastic motion.

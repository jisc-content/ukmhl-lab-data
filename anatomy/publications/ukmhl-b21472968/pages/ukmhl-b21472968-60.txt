58 RETHOSPECT OV ANATOMY AND FHVSIOLOGY, student, ambitious of distinction. But, in addition to this, the revival of the discussion touching the relation of the periods of rutting and menstruation to the spontaneous ripening and shedding of ova, has given all that activity to the investigation of this subject, which the introduction of an important theoiy invariably commu- nicates to every branch of natui-al inquiry. In the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, the im- pulse given by the brilliant discoveries of Bell, and more recently by those of Marshall Hall, Floui-ens, and others, is still manifest in the ardour with which numbers of eminent men follow out, in various dii-ections, the paths which these have opened. As yet, however, it is evident that in this branch of knowledge, discovery is only in its infancy. When we contemplate the vast number of problems as yet undetermined that here wait for solution,— problems whose data palpably lie within the limits of precise determination, and which already shape themselves out in the form of definite questions,—it is evident that this will long con- tinue to be the most stirring field of speculation in the whole domain of physiology. Wliat subject, indeed, is there in the whole range of human inquiry, so fit to excite the imagination and rivet the attention of a speculative being, as the construction and laws of action of those structm-es, wherein mind is so mysteriously blended Avith matter, and that union of will with mechanical force is efi'ected, which, while it has no parallel in nature, alone gives to man and animals their command over the world without? During the past year, many physiologists of high name, some of whom have already earned distinction in the same field, have, with various objects in view, and vath various success, devoted their time and energies to several branches of this difiicult inquiry. Many reasons, however, deter me from attempting anything like a complete analysis of their labours. Of these reasons, the follow- ing will, I doubt not, be deemed sufficient:— In the first place, several of the works in which these labours are set forth, are loaded with a vast mass of dry detail, which, from being by its very nature not susceptible of condensation, and from having no present connection mth physiological specu- lation, any attempt to present, in the form of abstract, would be alike wearisome and unprofitable. In the next place, it wdl be

The only point of any interest in these obsei'vtitions, was the rapid acceleration of this rate in the day or two inunediately j)receding death;—a ])eriod when common chemical agencies are beginning to resume their sway, and the enfeebled vital resistance is already giving up the body a prey to decay and dissolution. In regard to the total loss, M. Chossat attempts to deduce a general proposition to the effect that, whether life during inanition be more or less prolonged, this loss, compared with the original weight of the animal, is always nearly the same in the same species. The average in warm-blooded animals he states to be 40 per cent. It is obvious, however, that such a proposition as this cannot be taken in an absolute sense, for the amount of this proportional loss must vary largely with the amount of fat previously accumu- lated; nearly the whole of which, as is well known, disappears in starvation. Thus, in the now well-known instance of the hog that remained alive for 160 days, buried beneath a cliff at Dover, and shrunk during that time from 160 lbs. to 40 lbs., the loss, instead of being less than one-half, was three-fourths of the original weight.* This is a point, in fact, which is so clear as to need no illustration. M. Chossat made a great number of observations in order to ascertain in what proportions the various constituents of the body contribute to the general waste. The results he obtained are expressed in the following table, in which the loss sustained by each of these various constituents is set down in order, according as it stands above or below 0.40, which, it will be remembered, was the average loss of the whole body in M. Chossat's observations :— Parts which lose more than the \ Parts ivhich lose less than the mean 0.40. Fat 0.933 Blood 0.750 mean 0.40.

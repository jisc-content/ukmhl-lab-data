20 RETROSVECT or ANATOMT AND PHYSIOLOGY, the power, by a process entirely different from the oxidation by which their principal chemical products are extricated, to form new principles out of the elements of their food; to what extent, in short, they share in that constructive power which reaches so high a point in the plant, and which modern chemistry has shown to be the great characteristic of it. When we reflect, moreover, on the large proportion in which fat is found as a constituent of nervous matter; on its singular proneness to accumulate in some individuals, and the no less difficulty of its assimilation by others; and, lastly, on its vast importance as a store for the maintenance of animal heat in time of need; we shall gain some idea of the great interest which the ultimate decision of this qiiestion must have, both for the physiologist and the practitioner.* It must be confessed that M. Dumas' solution of it has the merit of simplicity, and derives much plaiisibility from Magendie's observations on the chyle, which have already been quoted; insomuch that, the chief obstacle in the way of its general accept- ance would, at first sight, seem to be the difficulty of supposing that the herbivora find in their food all the fat deposited in their tissues or furnished in their milk. The production of butter by the cow offered an opportunity of putting this to the test of experiment, and our authors, therefore, undertook to determine by exact analysis, the ratio of the fatty matter contained in the daily allowance of certain cows submitted to the investigation, to the amount of butter furnished in the milk of the same animals. The results fully confirmed their anticipations. The experiments on which they were founded, and which were conducted on a large scale and with great accuracy, form the basis of the memoir now under consideration. My space does not allow me to give more than their general results. These sufficiently establish the following conclusions, which I give in nearly the words of the memoii':â€” * An important remark, in connection with the uses of fat, has reference to its insolubility in water. It is this quality which especially fits fatty matters for forming a magazine of combustible matter in herbivorous animals; for as these animals, like all others, have to produce in the day a certain amount of heat, they undoubtedly effect this at the expense of the soluble (saccharine and starchy) products their blood contains, before attacking the insoluble comjiounds, such as the neutral fatty matters, which the chyle pours into it without ceasing.

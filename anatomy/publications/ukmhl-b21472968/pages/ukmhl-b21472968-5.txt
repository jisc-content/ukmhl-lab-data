A REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY IN THE YEAR 1843-4 4. The condition of physiology as a branch of knowledge—as an able writer has lately remarked of politics—was, up to a late period^ that which Bacon animadverted upon as the natural state of the sciences, while their cultivation is abandoned to practitioners j not being carried on as a branch of speculative inquiry, but only with a view to the exigencies of daily practice, and the experimenta frudifera, therefore, being aimed at almost to the exclusion of the lucifera. To this circumstance, quite as much as to the inherent and peculiar difficulties attending all investigation into the phenomena of life, must be ascribed the slow progress of physiology, while it was cultivated, more or less, with a view to its subservience to the practice of medicine.

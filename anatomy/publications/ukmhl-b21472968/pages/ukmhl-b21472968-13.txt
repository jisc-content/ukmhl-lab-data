11 BY WILLIAM BUDD, M.D. Carbon 52.78 Hydrogen 6.96 Nitrogen 16.78 Oxygen 23.48 The recent investigations of Mulder, liowevei-, of which I shall have to speak further on, cast some doubt over these results, and explain the difference between them and those previously current, upon other grounds. M. Dumas records, also, several analyses of proteine, which were made with the greatest care. The following is the formula which he regards as best representing the constitution of this body;— Carbon 48 54.44 Hydrogen 37 6.99 Nitrogen 12 15.88 Oxygen 15 22.69 Total 100.00 In regard to the composition of legumine, also, which on account of its abundance, and the important part it evidently plays as nutriment, in the seeds of leguminous plants, demands particular attention, M. Dumas differs firom Liebig. He denies that this body is, as the latter had asserted, identical with caseine, and states that it contains, without doubt, more nitrogen and less carbon. He is of opinion that it consists of a mixture or combina- tion of albumen or caseine with some other body richer in nitrogen, which modifies its most important properties. As, however, on being dissolved in hydrochloric acid it communicates the same properties as albumen, it is easy to suppose that, under the influence of the gastric juice, this matter furnishes the same soluble products as albumen itself. Besides these fom* principal products—albumen, caseine, fibrine, and legumine—the authors recognise two others—glutine and vitelline—so closely related to these by their mode of action with hydrochloric acid, as to blend with them in one group, however distinct their properties might at fii-st sight appear. This highly important memoir concludes with a theory of nutrition, which differs in many essential points from that generally received. Its peculiar features are these:—"That for the purposes of life, and especially for the maintenance of animal heat, it is

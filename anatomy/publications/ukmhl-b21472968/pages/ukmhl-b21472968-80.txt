78 RETROSPECT OF ANATOMY ANT) rHYSlOLOGY, invertebrata,—in short, among the purely automatic phenomena of the nervous system,—lies the great theatre of future discovery in the physiology of this system at large. Besides the beautiful applications of the discoveries already made, in this department, in elucidation of various functions of vital importance, the discoveries themselves have another and yet wider interest, in revealing the nervous agency to us under condi- tions of manifestation, in which its laws of action may be made the subject of precise and direct investigation. For a long time phy- siologists were baffled and embarassed in this inquiry, by haAdng to observe this agency more or less in complication, fancied or real, with sensation and volition. Having, for their contemplation in these latter endowments, powers that are interpreted by no analogy, and that have no standard of comparison beyond then- own sphere of action, an element was thereby introduced, which enveloped the whole inquiry in impenetrable and hopeless obscurity. But this obscurity has been finally dispelled by the discoveiy, for the first time consummated by the admirable investigations of Dr. Marshall Hall, that the motor powers of the nervous system, exercised through the spinal cord, survive the entu-e extinction of the psychical powers, by the removal of the structures which minister to these last, and may thus be obtained for observation in the most complete isolation. Few seem to have apprehended that of this discoveiy, this may one day prove to be the most important result. Hereby stripped of the complication in which it usually acts in the Hving animal, the nervous agency is brought under observation in its simplest mode of manifestation, under the form- of an impulse, acting at considerable distances, and through large masses of structm-e, so as to offer great advantages for determining the laws of its pro- pagation. So that here, in our investigation into one of the highest prerogatives of animal life, we unexpectedly meet with the facilities and conditions of common physical inquiry; having, moreover, for oui- subject, the properties of a power, acting in implicit submission to mere physical impressions, and, as it would seem, with a purely physical result; for the ultimate result of all these spinal acts, call it muscular contraction, or what we will, is an exertion of motor power that may be measured in mechanical units. However this may be, if we would discover the nature and

RETROSPECT OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, 42 aliments, the urine should therefore be alkaline, if no acids were added to it by the living body. But the uric and hippuric acids, which are products of the vital processes, and are removed from the organism, together with the soluble phosphates, through the urinary organs, both possess the property of combining with the soda or potass of the alkaline phosphates, and acquiring in the combination a higher degree of solubility than they possess of themselves, at the common temperatui-e of the body. " It is therefore ob^dous," as the author remarks, " that by the accession of these two acids, and by theii- action on the phosphates of soda, an urate and hippm-ate of soda must be formed, on the one hand, and an acid phosphate of soda, on the other; and that, consequently, the urine must acquire an acid reaction." Another acid, the sulphuric, which is continually being formed in the living body by the oxidation of su.lphm",—an element which is a tolerably large and a fundamental constituent of many kinds of food,—must also take its share of the alkaline bases, and further contribute to the same result; so that, in fact, the acidity of the urine is owing to the bases, which enter the economy as basic phos- phates, being divided between the phosphoric acid they are originally united with, and three acids formed in the living body, namely, the m'ic, hippuric, and sulphuric acids. From this it would appear, that if, in addition to the basic phosphates, food be taken containing alkalies in combination vrith vegetable acids, the urine may become alkaline Avithout the intervention of any other cu'cum- stance: for, in consequence of the oxidation which the acids of these salts undergo in the lining economy, they all reappear in the urine as alkaline carbonates. Now, all vegetable ahments, without exception,—tubers, roots, greens, potatoes, tui-nips, &c.,—contain salts of this kind; and Liebig asserts, that after eating largely of vegetables, or of fruits, as strawberries and cherries, the m'ine is invariably alkaline. When they are partaken of in a certain proportion, he states that the carbonated alkali derived from them neutralises the acids that are present, and renders the m*ine neutral; when in larger proportion, it imparts to the urine an alkaline reaction: from which he infers that the acid reaction of healthy urine is piu'ely accidental, and that urine of an alkaline or neutral reaction cannot be considered as a symptom of a chseased condition of the body. However this may be, all persons compc-

80 llETKOSPECT OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY, single law, or the detection of a single agency, has brought under the interpretation of one common principle. It must be remembered, too, that these actions of the nervous system are exercised through parts which are of common aspect, and consolidated in structure and functions; so that in discovering the essential anatomical conditions of the automatic phenomena, and in ascertaining the true relations of the ultimate elements of this anatomy, we may best hope for such interpretation as may be within our reach, of the relations of the more complicated struc- tures which minister to the higher functions. In the investigation of this department of the jjhysiology of the nervoxis centres, pursvxed with these views, we have as yet only broken ground; for the admirable discoveries of Marshall Hall, important as they are, and well deserving to immortalise his name, carry us but small -way towards these objects. Perchance their author might consider such objects altogether unattainable, or the pui'suit of them, through this channel, a retrogade movement. And, undoubtedly, the difficulty, so well stated by Dr. Holland, does occur here, namely, " Whether we can reason upon a single agent, where the functions differ thus widely in their nature?" " What we may justly infer, however,"—to use the words of the same writer,—looking to the common aspect of nervous struc- tui'e, and to the connection of nerves of difierent classes with each other and with common centres, is its being an element of the same nature, capable of similar relations of quantity or intensity, of translation to different organs along the course of nerves, and of suspension by like causes of injmy or disturbance." If this be so, who can estimate too highly the privilege with which late investigations have endowed us, in presenting this agency to our observation under a form of manifestation so open to precise investigation; or who can judge of the degree of light which the discovery of its laws of action by these means, may probably throw on the phenomena of sensation and will. But if this discovery may justly be expected to be of the highest importance in a purely physiological sense, still more instructive must its other relations be in their bearing on the nature of the mechanical powers with which animals are gifted. For although it has been shown, by direct experiment, that spinal innervation is not the soiu'ce, or, at any rate, not the only source of the contractile

X. ON CERTAIN DISTINCTIONS OF FORM HITHERTO UNNOTICED IN THE HUMAN PELVIS, CHARACTERISTIC OF SEX, AGE, AND RACE. By Professor Clelaj^d. PLATE XI, 1. Os Pubis.—A distinction between the male and female pelvis which has lately come under my notice in conversation with Mr. Christie, the Preparator of the Anatomical Museum, is one which I think worthy of special notice. It is this:—The distance between the lines marking the inner limit of attachment of the femoral muscles on the right and left side is considerably greater m the female than in the male. In a middle-aged or old female pelvis the line in question will always be seen marked by a distinct ridge, with a flattened surface extending inwards from it, covered in the recent state by the superficial ligament of the symphysis • and the distance between the two ridges of opposite sides will be found to increase as the pubic arch is approached. It is to be noted with regard to this distinction that it has great constancy. The obstetrician knows well that the pelvic cavity is not always more spacious in the female than the male neither is its axis always shorter, nor the pubic arch in every instance possessed of greater width than is to be found in many a male pelvis. But the character now mentioned is to be depended on, provided ossification is thoroughly completed. The weak point of the character is that it is difficult to apply in the case of a young adult. The statement that the iliac and ischial epiphyses inay not be completely united to the main bone till the 25th year IS probably correct. I note further, that in the female pelvis the scbal epiphysis unites earlier than the iliac, though I have seen "^'^ - innominatum ! complete at both of these places considerably earlier than at the

XIII. TERATOLOGY, SPECULATIVE AND CAUSAL, AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF ANOMALIES. By Professor Cleland. If the advantage which biological doctrine has hitherto derived from teratology has not been great, the reason has lain, not in the barrenness of the teratological field, but in -the small amount of progress made in determining the true nature of teratological phenomena. Even after the old conception of husus natures h ad been thrown aside, the most imperfect notions continued to prevail both with regard to abnormalities by excess and many of the more important abnormalities by defect. But we have now arrived at a time when no thoughtful inquirer can be longer content with merely cataloguing deviations and bestowing on them sesquipedalian names such as were perhaps justifiable in the days of the elder St. Hilaire. Investigation has entered on a more strictly causal stage, and, to my thinking, it becomes evident that teratology has an important work before it in relation to biological science generally, by demonstrating the presence of potentialities which in the normal organism remain latent, but nevertheless must exist, or they could not in exceptional circumstances show their presence. Just as in atavism the progeny reveals what was latent in the parent, so in monstrosities, potentialities of growth are revealed which never come to the surface in the ordinary course of develop- ment, but yet must exist in normal circumstances, otherwise they could not show themselves when exceptional conditions occur. The cyclopian nose and the intermaxillaries found in cases of completely cleft palate afford illustration of this. So also the occasional occurrence of more or less complete fissiparous division of the embryo is the only evidence we have, and it is ample evidence, that there is in the embryo an inherent possibility of fissiparous division capable of being excited to action, as the labours of Dareste abundantly show, by irritation from without.

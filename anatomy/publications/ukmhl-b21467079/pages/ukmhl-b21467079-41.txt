IV. GENITO-URINARY MALFORMATIONS CONSE- QUENT ON PELVIC DEFORMITIES. By John Yule Mackay, M.D. PLATE V. The varieties of mal-clevelopment wliicli have been described in connection with the genito-urinary organs are very numerous, and in many instances the products of abnormal action are so complex that explanation is difficult, often doubtful. The details of the case about to be described, while interesting in themselves and in respect of their apparent causation, are also noteworthy as pre- senting, when taken together, a marked approach towards the conditions which accompany the more complicated cases of vesical extroversion. It will be seen that the descriptions which follow are in many respects so similar that they suggest at least that the different cases had a sunilar origin. The subject is a female foetus of about the eighth month of intra-uterine development, kindly put in my possession by Dr. Grange of Cumnock. The length of the body from vertex to coccyx is 9-^- inches. The upper limbs and upper portion of the trunk ax-e normal, but below the umbilicus many indications of mal-development are met with, the special details of which may be described under the headings of the tissues or systems which they affect. Bones and Ligaments. Both feet are clubbedâ€”the right one particularly so. The right tibia shows an intra-uterine fracture, the end of the upper frag- ment forming a marked projection underneath the skin as may be seen from the plate. The right and left portions of the sym- physis pubis are separated from one another to the extent of If inches, and, in consequence of this, the umbilicus is dragged downwards to a position much lower than usual, lying beneath a line drawn between the anterior superior iliac spines. In con- sequence, also, the lower limbs are widely everted. There is,

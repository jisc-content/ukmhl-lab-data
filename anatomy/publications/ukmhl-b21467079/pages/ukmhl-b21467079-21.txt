II. ON THE FORM OF THE HUMAN SKULL AT DIFFERENT AGES AND IN DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES. By Professor Cleland. PLATJ] IV. Age. .The skull consists essentially of two parts, cranium aiid face; and, whether considered zoologically or embryologically, the development of the cranium is earlier than that of the face. Thus, in the oldest vertebrates of which we have certain record, the sharks, which are also the simplest of the craniota, the cranium is largely developed and. the face quite rudimentary; while in a chick, during the second day of hatching, the brain is already covered in before there is a trace of the face below it. I allude to these well-known circumstances because they are interesting on account of their bearing-on the limitation of the law often laid down on the assumption of genetic relationship, that the earlier a structure appears in the embryo the more remote the ancestry from which it is derived. The late appearance and growth of the face, as compared with the cranium, both zoologically and embryo- logically, agrees with such a law; while the appearance of the cranium and its contents before the digestive and vascular system can be recognised is in apparent contradiction to it. The facts of embryology appear to warrant the statement that the develojjment of both brain and cranium is in the first instance from behind forioards; Avhile, on the other hand, the trunk is developed vertebra by vertebra in the opposite direction; so that it may be said that a spot, corresponding probably with exactitude to the vital node of Flourens, is the point of departure of two growths opposed in direction like the plumule and radicle of a plant. But neither the growth of the brain nor. that of the cranium progresses regularly fi-om behind forwards. Thus, as regards the brain, the part connected with the eye, namely tlie primary optic

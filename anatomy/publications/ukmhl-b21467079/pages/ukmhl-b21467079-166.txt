They are in reality features marking the higher development in the human subject of a joint which in man alone reaches its greatest perfection in the two essential qualities of joint-structure, mobility and stability. EXPLANATION OF PLATE No. XVI. Fig. I.—The articular surface of the lower end of the femur :— a. Outer part of external groove. b. Inner part of the same. c. Internal groove. d. Patellar facet. Fig. II.—Upper end of the tibia with semilunar cartilages in position:— a. Small portion of anterior and inner border of external condyle left uncovered by semilunar cartilage. The extent of this exposed part is increased when the semilunar cartilage is pushed forwards in extension. b. Anterior end of external semilunar cartilage, turning on itself as it passes to its insertion. In this position the semilunar cartilage covers the concave portion of the anterior and inner margin of the tibial condyle. c. Groove on tibia just beyond margin of articular surface of external condyle. Into this groove the edge of the semilunar cartilage is pressed in full extension of joint. d. Depressed part of articular surface of external tibial condyle. e. Anterior end of internal semilunar cartUage. / and g. Anterior and posterior crucial ligaments. h. The fibres passing from posterior part of external semilunar cartilage to join with posterior crucial. The cut ends of the transverse ligament are seen towards front of semilunar cartilages.

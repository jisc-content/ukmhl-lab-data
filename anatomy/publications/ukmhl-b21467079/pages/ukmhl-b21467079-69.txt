VI. THE ARTERIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK AND THE RETE MIRABILE OF THE PORPOISE (Phoccena communis). By John Yule Mackay, M.D. PLATE VII. Cetacean aniinals, as a group, present manj^ peculiarities of general structure, the effects of which, as modifying the vascular system, are exceedingly interesting to study. The rudimentary state of development of the limbs and the extreme shortness of the neck have a large influence in altering the usual arrangement of the vessels of the parts which they most affect; In addition, the anatomy of the great arterial rete, possessed by many of them in connection apparently with their power of remaining under- neath the water for considerable periods, has lately become the subject of controversy. The descriptions in this paper are taken from the dissection of two specimens (adult and fcetal) of the common porpoise, which were put at my disposal through the kindness of Professor Cleland. Short accounts of the anatomy of the larger arteries and of the rete mirabile in the cetacean class are given by Hunter,* and by Owen,t but only a general summary is attempted by either. I need only touch briefly upon those points which have already been sufficiently described. The first of the primary branches of the aorta, a large innominate artery, divides into two, the brachio-carotid and an artery which Owen, guided by the nomenclature of human anatomy, calls the posterior thoracic, but which is found in the anterior portion of the thorax, coursing backwards as far as the fifth rib. The second of the primary trunks is the left brachio-carotid. The third vessel * "Observations on the Structure and Economy of Whales." John Hunter, Philoa.

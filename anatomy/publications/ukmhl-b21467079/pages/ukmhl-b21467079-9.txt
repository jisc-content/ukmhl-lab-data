ON BIRDS WITH SUPERNUMERARY LEGS, AND ON ABCAUDAL FISSION AND ACEPHALUS; WITH BIOLOGICAL REFLECTIONS. By Professor Cleland. PLATES I., II., III. The occun-ence of fowls with one or two appended limbs hanging between the legs on which they support themselves is well known. I had my attention first dii-ected to it by specimens in the Anatomical Museum at Berlin many years ago. I have now four specimens of this abnormality beside me, all differing in detail, and, on comparing them, perceive that they have an interest not hitherto noticed, and that they demonstrate that the cases occur- ring in the human subject, described as exhibiting an appended undeveloped twin, have'been habitually misinterpreted. The first specimen (Fig. 2) to which I shall direct attention con- sists of a portion of the skeleton of a pheasant, and belongs to the anatomical collection of the University. It exhibits between- the sacrum and the hinder part of the left ilium an angular interval, occupied by a diamond-shaped element, two inches in breadth, and nearly symmetrical, from which hangs an additional limb. The diamond thus intruded forms one bone traversed transversely, as seen from behind, by the projecting inferior edge of its u^jper half, which is dorsally convex, while the inferior half, dorsally concave, exhibits, as seen from the ventral aspect, a superior margin thrown into two concavities, with a peak between; and opposite each there is a fossa between the upper and lower halves of the diamond, the right one perforated, the other not. The left of these concave margins lies side by side with a perfectly similar margin continued from the left ischium to the ilium, so as to complete the great sciatic foramen; while the one to the right, abutting against the left side of the sacrum, corresponds symmetri- cally with the margin completing the great sciatic foramen of the

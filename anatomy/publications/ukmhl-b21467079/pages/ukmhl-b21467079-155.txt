XVI. ON THE GEOOVES SEPAEATING THE PATELLAR EEOM THE MENISCO-TIBIAL SURFACES OF THE FEMUE, AND ON LOCKING OF THE KNEE-JOINT IN FULL EXTENSION. By E. Bruce Young, M.A., M.B., CM. PLATE XVI. Most anatomists who describe the two grooves marking off the patellar from the menisco-tibial portions of the articular surface at the lower end of the femur,* look upon them as the result of pressure of the femur on the semilunar cartilages during full extension of the knee-joint. Langer, indeed, states f without further explanation that they are not solely the impressions of the semilunar cartilages, but the generally accepted theory is that they are, and this is supported by Terrillon in a paper specially devoted to the question. J Heiberg, § however, rejects this explanation, and maintains that they are notliing more than the representatives in the human subject of the complete separation existing in some of the lower animals between the patellar and the two menisco-tibial surfaces of the femur. 11 * Henle—Luschka—Beaunis et Bouchard—Hueter—Morris—Meyer and Terrillon quoted by Heiberg in Arch, fiir Anat., His u. Braune, 1883. p. 171-2. + Das Knie-Gelenk des Mensch., p. 6. § Jour, de L'Anat. et de la Physiolog. 1879. p. 35 et se.q. X Heiberg, I. c, calls the grooves " vertieften Linien ". This expression is, I think, insuificient, for the grooves are more than mere " vertieften Linien," and as there are both " Vertief ungen " and " Linien" marking off the parts of the femoral surface it is apt to mislead. II Panas also speaks of the grooves as being simply the lines of separation between the tibial and patellar surfaces of the femur (Terrillon, ^.c, p. 36.)

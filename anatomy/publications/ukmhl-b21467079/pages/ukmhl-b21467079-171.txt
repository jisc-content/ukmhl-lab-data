MEMOEANDA. 1. Portrait of the late Professor Goodsir. In offering to Anatomists a portrait of John Goodsir I need make no apology if, as I am fully supported in believing, I have fairly succeeded in reproducing the expression and form of his features. The portrait at the commencement of his collected works is not in the slightest degree like him, it represents a feeble old man with a little chin. But Goodsir's chin was massive and in keeping with his tall and powerful build, and there never was a trace of mental feebleness in his face. A photograph exists of him, which I have made use of, but it represents him with the painful effects of illness too visible in both face and figure. I have sought therefore to catch that happier expression with a lurking smile which was wont to animate his appearance when he was interested in conversation or in expounding his views in lecture; and as far as I could, I have endeavoured to recall him as he was before his illness, the robust surgeon and naturalist, as well as the philosopher who pointed out the agency of the nucleated corpuscle in both secretion and absorption. Born March 20, 1814, he died March 6, 1867. It was only for a few years before his death that he took to wearing beard and moustache, which hid the highly characteristic mouth. In his dress he had certain peculiarities. He wore his waistcoat buttoned to the top, and lectured in a dress coat such as is now only worn in the evening, and for an introductory lecture used to appear with a white neckcloth on, without any fastening in front. It is in such dress that I have represented him. J. C. 2,â€”ACEPHALUS. The following specimen seems worthy of description, particularly as it does not seem to be obviously favourable to my theoiy of acephalus. No. 194 of my collection is an acephalous human fojtus, history unknown. Both legs show constrictions tending to intra-uterine amputation. The integument of the penis is large

The peculiar feature in this interesting abnormal condition is the apjiearance of the posterior wall of the bladder upon the front of the abdomen, this being due to a deficiency alike of the anterior abdominal and vesical walls; but in the great majority of cases this malformation does not stand alone, but is accompanied by others of a more or less important character. The literature of extroversion is exceedingly large. A succinct account of the main details of the deformity is given by Phillips.* And among the many other more recent contributions is one by Champneysf in which the author, after describing a special dissec- tion, reviews very thoroughly the whole subject, and gives an elaborate list of the writers who have already treated it. Still more modern additions to the literature will be found in the description of special cases by Doran| and Ogston.ยง The general summary which will be given here is in great part drawn from Champneys' paper, and the references to the descriptions cited will be found in the very complete list of works with which that paper is furnished. The varieties of the characteristic malformation are very numerous. Mayo describes a case in which there was no fissure either of the abdominal or vesical Avail, but only a hernial pouch containing a perfect bladder. The pubic bones were five inches apart. Vrolik describes a case in which a perfect bladder pro- truded through a fissure of the anterior abdominal wall. On the other hand, the posterior wall of the bladder is not only found pro- jecting upon the surface of body, but cases are described in Avhich the vesical surface is partially or completely split into two lateral portions, the intestine or genital organs lying between the parts. Of such a nature are those described by Bartels, Retzius, Friedlander, Rose, Friinckel, Meckel, and Doran. So fiir as I have been able to determine, in cases of complete fission it is usually only the lower portion of the normal posterior Avail Avhich * Todd's Cijdopmd. of Anatomy and Physiology. Vol. i.

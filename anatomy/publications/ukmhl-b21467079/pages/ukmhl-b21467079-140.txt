Cerebro-spinal. a. Part or whole of the central canal of the spinal cord—spina bifida.* h. Part or whole of the cerebral ventricles—anen- cephalus, cyclopia, hernia cerebri in its different vai'ieties, C. By Strangulation. 1. From thickened tissue occluding openings or preventing their formation. a. Imperfections of middle and external ears. h. Obstructions of buccal opening, leading to sweUing of the pharynx and agnathia. c. Obstruction of urethra, leading to ectopia vesicae and epispadias. d. Obstruction of vent, leading to imperforate anus. There are instances of imperforate anus in which the coats of the rectum are'gathered to a spot behind the prostate and the mucous membrane to a pit there, as if it had been within the grasp of a constriction, and these are the cases referred to. 2. From obstruction to the separation and expansion of potential parts. a. Lateral organs may be bound together so as to remain united in the middle line, while the mesial structure which ought to have intervened, and the most closely crushed parts of their own structure are suppressed. There can be little doubt that such malformations are to be attributed to tissue of increased density strangling the node of growth of the mesial structures and tying down the lateral parts. This seems to be the case in the cyclopian eye and the cyclopian proboscis. I should think that sympodia is to be explained in the same way. * It is unnecessary to discuss here the varieties of spiua bifida with the many disputable points as to their causation, but I may refer to the article which I have contributed to Dr. Morton's work, "The Treatment of Spina Bifida by a New Method." Second edition, 1887.

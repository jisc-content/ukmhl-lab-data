XII THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM OP YERTEBRATES HOMOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED. By Dr. J. Yule Mackay. PLATES XIII., XIY Iff a paper communicated to the Journal of Anatomy, January, 1886, Prof. A. Macalister systematises the arrangements of the arteries of man, and draws a comparison between them and a typical arterial scheme founded upon considerations derived from embry- ology and comparative anatomy. An examination conducted upon such lines provides in many cases a simple explanation of details which, when viewed from the standpoint of human anatomy alone, appear complicated and unintelligible. The development of the arterial system, however, has necessarily been a complicated process, and it is only by the continued accumulation of data that one can hope to understand the relations which subsist between the simple arrangements of lower forms and the highly modified systems of more advanced animals. While agreeing with Prof. Macalister in many cases as to the homological relations of individual arteries, I believe that there is still room for further investigation, and have been led to offer in some instances a different view of development. This is particularly the case in connection with the relations of the branchial arterial arches to the visceral and parietal branches of the longitudinal trunks, and the relations of the branches of the external carotid artery to those of the subclavian and other derivatives of the dorsal longitudinal vessel. I have also added a view of the homologies of the branches of the abdominal and pelvic arteries. The arteries of a vertebrated animal may be divided into two groups—(1) a primary system consisting of large vessels, and (2) a secondary or branch system passing from the primary to the supply ot the body. •' The Primary System. In the early embryonic stage of a vertebrate animal the primary system of vessels consists of the following elements :-(l) Two

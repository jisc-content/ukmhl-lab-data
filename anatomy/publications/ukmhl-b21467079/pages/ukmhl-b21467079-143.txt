Peof. Cleland on Teratology, Speculative and Causal 135 (b) Smaller division included within the other. Three such cases are on record, published by G. W. Young, Dupuytren, and N. Highmore. (c) Smaller division completely separated from the continuous foetus and forming an acephalus, (See p. 7 of this volume.) (S) One division of the trunk disappears altogether, and the right and left pelvic limbs of the right and left divisions respectively are completely developed, while the left pelvic limb of the right division and the adjacent right pelvic limb of the left division are dwarfed and more or less blended («) with partial visceral duplicity; (6) without any visceral duplicity. To this group belong limbs appended to the perinseum, and amorphous tumours attached to the sacrum. (See foregoing Memoir on Birds with Supernumerary Legs.) (4) One division of the trunk almost completely dis- appears, and the adjacent lower limbs of the two divisions completely disappear. (See Memoran- dum 4, "Spina Bifida with Bony Projections into the Spinal Canal.") B. Abcranial. (1) The divisions equally developed. (a) Duplicity in front of the occipital bone. (6) Complete duplicity of the head and part of the spinal column. (2) One division larger than the other. (a) The smaller division appended in front, and consisting of the head, limbs, and part of the body, e.g., Lazarus Colloredo. (6) The smaller division broken off as an acormus. (5) The axial parts of one division of the bifurcated embryo entirely disappears, the right pectoral limb of the right division and the left pectoral limb of the left division being developed as normal limbs, while the adjacent pectoral limbs of the two divisions form an appendage connected with the cervical vertebrae.

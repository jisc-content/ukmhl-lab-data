V. THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM .OF THE CHAMELEON (Cham^leo Vulgaris). By John Yule Mackay, M.D. PLATE VI. The Arterial System op the Chameleon (Oham^leo Vulgaris). Short accounts of the arterial system iii the reptilia generally are given in most of the works on Comparative Anatomy, the most detailed being those of Meckel* and Owen.t But even in these nothing more than a description of the larger vessels is attempted. By far the most important contributions to the study of the vascular system in this group are those of Rathke, and his minute descriptions of the vessels which in their origin are'more or less connected with the aortic arches have thrown much lieht upon the development of the larger trunks. In one' of his papers^ he touches upon the arterial system of the chamseleon, but it is chiefly to the aortic roots and to the superficial cervical vessels that he directs his attention. In my descriptions which folloW; and which have been taken from the careful dissection of three fully-grown specimens of Chamceleo vulgaris, much will be found which difiers very widely from the accounts of the typical reptilian arteries, more especially in connection with the vessels of the fore and hind limbs, and of the visceral cavity. A complete account of the many modifications of the vascular system met with in this large group of animals would be a valuable aid to the interpretation of much that is still unsolved in the development of this and allied classes. The truncus arteriosus arising from the heart, divides into four large branches, the pulmonary arteries and the aortse. After the division all the trunks arch forwards for some distance * Traite General D'Anatomie Comparee, J. F. Meckel. Trad, par H. Schuster.

Db. Mackay on Abnormal Arteries of Upper Limb. 141 In the paper before mentioned Euge* has pointed out that when two vessels are present in the upper arm one of them is always a "collateral stem," the result of an enlargement of anastomosing branches which in normal circumstances remain comparatively undeveloped. The collateral stem to which he calls attention is one which is formed of vessels distributed to the biceps muscle, anastomosing at the elbow with muscular and recurrent branches of the radial and ulnar arteries, and when enlarged occupying a position superficial to the median nerve. The case described above points to the presence of another line of anasto- mosing branches lying along the anterior surface of the internal inter-muscular septum by way of the superior and inferior profunda arteries, the anastomotic, and the anterior ulnar recurrent, capable of being so enlarged as to produce abnormal relations. It is interesting to note the results of enlargement of portions or all of this chain. "Were the branches stretching between superior profunda, inferior profunda, and anastomotic considerably dilated, while the first and last of these vessels still retained their connection with che parent trunk, there would result an apparent splitting or "island building" of the brachial artery. Again, as in the present case, the moderate enlargement of the whole chain would produce a "vas aberrans" connected below with the ulnar artery; while a greater enlargement with failure of the proper root of the ulnar would result in one form of high origin of the ulnar artery.

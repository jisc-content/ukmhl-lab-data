110 PnoF. Cleland on the Tail in Myxine and Pelromytion. cleuaeuts in the turtle, and also elements in the roof of the sturgeon's head, is too obvious, let us hope, to require remark. As regards plates or bars of cartilage common to a number of fin-rays, it is to be remarked that, although those in the tails of Myxine and Petromyzon are undoubtedly remarkable, they are not without analogy in other fins among the elasmobranchs. Thus the large plate at the base of each dorsal fin in Acanthias is, in the first dorsal, the bearer of three narrower plates, each bearing another surmounted by two nodules, and in the scond dorsal, it is the bearer of two which support three others, each surmounted by a minute addition. So, also, in both dorsals of Squatina and in the anal fin of Lamna, there are plates which belong to more than one ray. In two respects, however, the structures found in Myxine and Petromyzon difier, so far as I know, from anything found in other orders of fishes, namely, that they present a number of simple continuous rays united by a common base, and that these plates, common to a number of rays, are situated in the tail.

Young on Grooves and Look of Knee-joint. occur, seeing that there are no ridges tliere, and that a checking of the movement never takes place there, that checking being, according to his view, brought about by the posterior and the lateral ligaments. When the form and relations of the parts of the semilunar cartilages, and of the part of the margin of the external tibial articular surface with vs^hich the anterior parts of the menisco- tibial surfaces of the femur come in contact at the close of extension are taken into consideration, I fail to see the diflBculty in understanding how the femoral surface should, even Avithout the presence of ridges, become marked by grooves developed under a pressure which increases as age advances, and the influence of which they help to counteract. The ridges forming the anterior borders of the grooves develop as the grooves deepen. As to the checking of the movement of extension, no doubt, in young subjects this is mainly efiected by the ligaments (lateral, posterior, anterior crucial, and posterior part of the posterior crucial); but as the weight borne by the femur and the consequent demand for greater stability at the knee-joint increase, the grooves on the femur are developed; and by closing on the anterior parts of the semilunar cartilages, and in the case of the outer groove, on part of the margin of the tibial condyle as well, aid the ligaments in resisting the tendency to over-extension. In conclusion, Heiberg points out that on examination of the skeleton in certain of the lower animals (orang, elephant, lion, bear, sloth, kangaroo, porcupine, hysena), he finds the grooves on the femur present, and argues that seeing these animals in standing have the knee-joint in a more or less flexed position, so'that the grooves do not come into contact -svith the semilunar cartilages, the grooves cannot be due to the pressure of the cartilages. Having thus satisfied himself that neither in the human subject nor in the lower animals are these grooves the result of pressure, he maintains that they are the representatives of the non-articular craps found in the ox, camel, and llama, separating the articular surface of the condyles of the femur from that of the trochlea. As to the markings on the articular surface of the femur in the lower animals, I examined casts of this surface in the tiger and the racoon, which casts taken from the fresh joint surface represent its markings more truly than the dry bones, and I find that the lines of separation between the menisco-tibiajl and the trochlear

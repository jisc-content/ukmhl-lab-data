80 Mr. Young on Morphology of Cervical Articular Pillo/ris. Museum of Glasgow University, an excessive acute curvature in' the lower dorsal region has so altered the normal .curve of the upper dorsal vertebraj, that, instead of a convexity posteriorly, they present a concavity continuous with the cervical curve; and, being thus thrown into over-extension, nearly all the dorsal vertebrte exhibit a great development of the- locking grooves behind the superior articular surfaces. The locking of bone against bone is exemplified in many of the other joints of the body, e.g., the elbow, the wrist, and the ankle, the principle involved being, as Dr. Cleland informs me, one on which Goodsir was wont to lay .great stress, the limit of movement of a joint, according to him, never depending entirely on the resistance of stretched ligament, but rather on the locking of bone against bone. EXPLANATION OF PLATE VIII. View of the first dorsal and lower four cervical vertebra described in the text. (a) Process on the articular pillar of the fifth cervical. Similar processes are seen on both sides of the sixth, and a trace of such a projection on the right side of the fifth. (b) Projection from the transverse process of the first dorsal. (c) Groove for the reception of the loAver edge of the inferior articular process of the seventh cervical.

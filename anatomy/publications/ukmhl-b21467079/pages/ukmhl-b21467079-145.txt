XIV. CASES OF ABNORMALITY OF THE ARTERIES OF THE UPPER LIMB. By John Yule Mackay, M.D. PLATE XV., Figs. 1 and 2. The following cases, -which have been selected from the records of a large number of subjects in which the arteries of the arm departed from the usual arrangement, demonstrate the inaptitude of the present system of nomenclature of thq abnormal vessels. They suggest also the methods by -which in certain circumstances these vessels arise. (1.) In both arms of a male subject, dissected in the -winter of 1887, the arteries were found to be disposed in an abnormal manner. In the left arm, which presented the simpler arrangement, the axillaiy artery (Fig. 2, Plate XV.) divided immediately above the tendon of the teres major muscle into two trunks which were continued through the arm. Near the forearm one of these trunks divided into radial and ulnar arteries, while the other passed on to distribution as the common interosseous artery. According to the accepted system of nomenclature the first of these vessels is to be regarded as the "true brachial artery," and the second as a "high interosseous artery." The first (the so-called true brachial artery), the smaller of the two, passed down the upper arm, running along the inner margin of the biceps muscle, in front of the median nerve, and gave off in its course merely a few slender branches to the biceps. At the lower end of the upper arm it deviated a little to the inner side, and divided about half-an-inch above the level of the elbow joint into radial and ulnar arteries. Of these derivative trunks the

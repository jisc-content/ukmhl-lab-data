128 Prop. Cleland on Teratology, Speculative and Causal. In like manner a careful study and collation of the varieties of multiplication of digits will lay bare the mode of action, in exceptional circumstances, of powers of growth ordinarily altogether hid, and may possibly throw light on the nature and seat of the powers by which the normal digits are developed. I have gone even further, and in a previous article (" On Birds with Super- numerary Legs"), have arrived from teratological data at such gene- ralizations as that every vertebrate animal has at an early period a latent capability of splitting up indefinitely; that there are factors at work in development which are not resident in the individual chemical molecules nor even in the individual nucleated corpuscles; and that the moulding powers of two individualities may be at work in arese overlapping one another, that is to say, may exhibit their influence on one mass of tissue by organs of the two individualities being developed, mutually included each within the territory of the other. The future of teratology in relation to the larger biological problems promises great things. But to attain them it is necessary that the study should advance within its own limits and proceed from mere phenomenology to causation; and it is only by degrees that we can expect to lay bare the causes of phenomena so complex. Yet as the operations of causes unfold themselves, questions become simplified, in as much as appearances very diverse are often found to be allied. Thus, I have elsewhere pointed out in general terms how closely related are anencephalus, encephalocele, and cyclopia, all of them being results of over- stimulation of the more superficial parts already laid down iu the young embryo, and depending for their peculiarities on the precise extent and date of the stimulation; and have further given reasons for believing that such overstimulation, when it occurs soon after impregnation of the ovum, leads to fissiparous division of the germinal mass, resulting in two embryos; that at a later period, or carried to a slighter extent, it will cause partial division resulting in such forms of double monster as have a portion of the cerebro-spinal axis undivided; that at a still later period, when the cephalic end of the neural furrow is formed but is still open, it produces thickening and irregular folding of the cerebro-spinal axis such as effectually prevent its assumption of the cylindrical form; that anencephalus is produced by rupture after the primary optic vesicles are cut off from the cerebral vesicles; that lumbar spina bifida is occasioned at a later date; and that cyclopia also is

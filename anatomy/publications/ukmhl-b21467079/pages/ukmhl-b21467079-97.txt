IX. NOTES ON THE VISCERA OF GYMNOTUS ELECTRICUS. By Peofessor Cleland. [Kead at the Meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen, Sept., 1885.] PLATE X, Naturally bv far the greatest interest attached to Gymnotus ehctricusi^ in connection with its electric organs, both because its batteries are so much more powerful than those of any other lish and because electric organs are structures found in so few c^enera so widely removed, and, although possessing certain characters in common, differ so much one from another in'structure and situa- tion. Thus, a certain homology may perhaps be made out between the inferior batteries of Gymnotus and the "pseudo-electric" organs m the tail of Mormyrus, as also between the two pairs of batteries of Gymnotus, and the pseudo-electric organs of Gym- narchus, described by Erol {Stanrdus Zootomie d. Fische\- A ujlaye, p. 123) but the batteries of Gymnotus, lying between the muse es and supplied by the spinal cord, are not in the slightest degree homologous with those of the only other teleostean genus which gives a shock, viz., Malapterurus; for the batteries of Malapterurus are unconnected with the muscles of the trunk are connected closely with the skin, combining to surround th^ whole body, and are supplied by a single pair ^f nerves from th neighbourhood of the brain. Still more remarkable is it th." he pseudo^lectnc organs found in the tails of Skates, placed udinally where muscles might have been expected, are capab e of oniparison wrth the electric organs of Gymnot:s, but hav no But though I thus ie this ^o::x^i^J^

Prof. Cleland on Teratology/, Speculative and Causal. Longitudinal fission of embryonic mass. 1. Complete fission. A. Permanent—twins in one chorion. £. Temporary—the divisions subsequently united by corresponding parts. These are double-monsters having, common to both divisions, no portion of column nor cranial base such as might belong to a single fojtus. (1) Union confined to the neighbourhood of a common umbilicus, e g., the Siamese twins. (2) Union from umbilicus upwards to form one thoracic cavity. (3) One thoracic cavity and the heads also united (a) with two complete faces, the half of each belonging to each body—Janiceps ; (6) with the hinder face and adjacent portions of crania undeveloped from want of room. (4) Union of cranial vaults of two fcetuses, otherwise distinct, and having two umbilici. (5) Union pelvic, heads at opposite ends, legs and genitals thrown to the sides. 2. Incomplete fission. A. Abcaudal. (1) The divisions equally developed, one head and two bodies. (a) Adjacent upper limbs distinct. (b) Adjacent upper limbs blended together. (2) One division altogether larger than the other; the larger continuous with the head and upper part of the column; the connections of the smaller division defective. (a) Smaller division appended to the thorax or abdo- men, and exhibiting a pair of lower limbs with variable amount of body and sometimes a pair of upper limbs, while its thoracic viscera may be contained within the thorax of the developed individual. Lalloo, a Hindu, IS years of age, at present alive, is a good example.

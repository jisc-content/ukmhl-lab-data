XI. ON THE SKELETON OF THE TAIL IN MYXINE AND PETEOMYZON. By Professor Cleland. PLATE XII. The exact position of tlie cyclostome is a subject on which opinions various, and some of them hazy, are held. In days when animals were arranged in linear series, the osseous fishes deemed the highest and the plagiostomes placed lower in the scale, there was little difficulty in settling that the cyclostomes came between the plagiostomes and Amphioxus. Those days are past. But the appreciation of affinity between the cyclostomes and plagiostomes, which is apparent throughout the great work of Joannes MtlUer on the "Comparative Anatomy of the Myxinoids," is a just appreciation J and while the lampreys and myxinoids have such extraordinary modifications of mouth, nose, and throat as mask, almost beyond recognition, the resemblance of their heads to those of other fishes, and indicate them to be highly aberrant from the main line of the advance of life, the anatomy of the rest of the body, and especially the brain, vertebral column, and tail show how nearly they are allied to the elasmobranchs. But the tail perhaps on account of its simplicity, has not received the attention it deserves. In macerating a Myxine with a view to studying its skeleton, I was surprised to find beneath the notochord, at its hinder end a cartilaginous structure of unique appearance, which had ap- parently altogether escaped the observation of previous dissectors. I exhibited the specimen to the biological section of the British Association at Aberdeen. It consists of a mesial plate about half an inch long, attached along the under border of the terminal part of he cylinder enclosing the notochord and is itself in the recent s ate covered by a strong fibrous sheath. This cartila- ginous plate IS of triangular forn,, having a short vertically-placed

VII. ON THE MOKPHOLOGY OF THE CERVICAL AETICULAR PILLARS; AND ON A LOCK LIMITING EXTENSION OF THE NECK. By R. Bruce Young, M.A., M.B., CM., Demonstrator of Anatomy. PLATE VIII. My attention was drawn to the specimen figured in the Plate by the fact that the ordinarily described roughnesses, which mark the bony pillars supporting the articular surfaces of the cervical verte- brae, had here risen into more or less distinct processes. These pro- cesses are seen to form the continuations upwards and inwards of rough markings, which are situated on the back of the articular pillars, and are most distinct on the right and left sidfes of the sixth cervical vertebra, and on the left side of the fifth (Plate VIII., a). They lie behind and below the upper articular surfaces of their respective vertebrae, those on the left side in the fifth and sixth measuring one-eighth of an inch, that on the right side of the sixth somewhat less. On the right side of the fifth vertebra a mere nodule, slightly raised from the surface, afi^ords a trace of the processes found in the others, while on the seventh, owing to the obliteration of the lateral notch, which in the upper cervicals lies between the articular pillar and the transverse process, the raised niarkmg from which the projection springs is seen (specially on the left side) to pass out on to the back of the transverse process, only a trace of roughness being left behind the articular process. From behind the articular processes in the first dorsal all traces of the projections have disappeared, and on the left side a shght elevation about half way out on the transverse pro- cess IS all that marks the continuation downwards of the series (Plate VIIL, h). With reference to those processes, I examined the cervical vertebra, m thirty-scven cases, and found that in one case the series of distinct though small processes, similar in form and position to those in the .specimen ligured, was complei,- on both

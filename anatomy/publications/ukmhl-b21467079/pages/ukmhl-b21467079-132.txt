A very interesting relation of parts is exhibited in a preparation of the arteries of the hooded seal (Stemmatopus cristatus) in Professor Cleland's Museum. The vertebral artery (PI. VIII.) in this animal, while arising from the subclavian, is reinforced by a considerable longitudinal anas- tomotic chain lying between transverse processes and necks of ribs, and springing from a trunk common to the first and second aortic intercostal arteries. These relations call to mind the anatomy of the vertebral artery in the crocodile, but there is this diflference to be noted, namely, the subclavian arteiy of the seal is dorsal, that of the crocodile is ventral in origin. In the human subject Mr. A. M. Paterson* has described a vertebral artery arising, not from the subclavian, but abnormally from the first aortic intercostal artery. Such a case as this is obviously to be explained by the failure of the branch from the subclavian artery to the vertebral anastomotic chain, which in the circumstances has had to depend for its supply of blood upon the next parietal circle—the first aortic intercostal.

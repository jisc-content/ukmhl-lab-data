174 Memoranda, 14.â€”Flocculus. Though the development of the third cerebral vesicle has been in its general features very well known, it does not seem, to have been generally recognised that a direct consequence of the mode of first appearance of the cerebellum and of the flocculus is that these parts are morphologically totally distinct. It is the easiest thing in the world to demonstrate in the sheep or in the fowl that the first appearance of the cerebellum is as a mesial lamina passing backwards from the anterior limit of the third cerebral vesicle, and that the mammalian and avian cerebellum is a mesial dorsal pouch quite comparable with the piscine cerebellum. In fact one already sees in the elasmobranchs the transverse lamination of the pouch and the intrusion behind it of the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. The nidus avis is the original pouch-cavity, and the free edge of the posterior velum is the edge which was originally directed backwards, separated on each side by a transverse fissure from what afterwards is folded outwards to become the outer edge of the ligula. Thus there is altogether an originally "f-shaped breach of continuity in the cerebral cylinder, by which the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle intrudes, repeating very much the state of matters further forwards, where the choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles enter by fissures directed outwards, and the plexus of the third ventricle projects through a longitudinal fissure meeting them in the middle. But if the fissure between posterior velum and ligula be followed outwards it leads to the flocculus, which is developed, as is easily seen and well known, from the waUs bounding the extremity of this fissure. This fissure, which may be termed the transverse fissure of the fourth ventricle, and extends from the hollow peduncle of one flocculus to that of the other, lies in the concavity of the bend forward of the upper part of the medulla oblongata, whUe the cerebellum is developed from the overhanging convexity backwards, its anterior and upper part appearing first. Thus the cerebellum is mesial, the flocculus lateral, and the cerebellum originates from a part of the third vesicle further forward than the Bocculus. It is worth while pointing out that the optic vesicles are lateral outgrowths, and that there is no reason why the olfactory bulbs should not be considered as lateral outgrowths, also that the nuclei of the auditory nerve lie close to the flocculus, and that the flocculus "is large in the cat, the aye-aye, the timid rodents, and all the small mammals with

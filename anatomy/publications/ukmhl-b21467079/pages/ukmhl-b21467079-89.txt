VIII. ON DEVELOPMENT AND ABNORMAL ARRANGE- MENT OF THE INTESTINE. By R. Bruce Young, M.A., M.B., CM. PLATE IX. The interest attaching to any individual instance of abnormality in bodily structure must always be increased, when, besides describing the peculiarities of the case in itself, we can point to the original pathological interference, and trace, with the aid of development, the mode in which it has led to the divergence from the normal. Sometimes an abnormal arrangement affords a picture, more or less altered in detail by subsequent growth, but still true in its essential features, of the state of matters which existed at the time when the change took place, and thus not only are we enabled to explain the adult condition, but light may conversely be thrown on the mode of development of the parts concerned. Acting on such considerations, I venture to add another to the list of recorded misplacements of the great intestine. Abnormality. The subject was an adult male. The ctecum projected into the pelvis, and with the lower part of the ascending colon lay free on the left side of the middle line (Pig. 1, a). At a point just over the left common iliac artery the colon first became bound to the posterior abdominal wall. Thence it passed obliquely upwards for about four inches, still in contact with the wall of the abdomen, till it reached a point on the left side of the aorta at the level of the superior mesenteric artery and close to the upper end of the duodenum. Turning abruptly to the left, the bowel now descended as low as the iliac fossa, and thence passed upwards in a series of closely i^acked convolutions to reach the splenic flexure. In this part of its course the intestine was more or less adherent to the postenor parietes. From the splenic flexure the descending colon ran normally into the sigmoid flexure and rectum.

9 XV. THE RELATIONS OF THE APONEUROSIS OF THE TRANSVERSALIS AND INTERNAL OBLIQUE MUSCLES TO THE DEEP EPIGASTRIC ARTERY AND TO THE INGUINAL CANAL. By John Yule Mackay, M.D. PLATE XV, Fig. 3. The anterior aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle has been usually described as forming along with a portion of the aponeu- rosis of the internal oblique the upper part of the posterior wall of the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle, and the semilunar fold of Douglas has been regarded as marking the lower limit of the disposition of these tendons behind the muscle.* The records of a large number of dissections made in the anatomical rooms during the last three years, during which period attention has been specially directed to this point, make it evident that this description does not conform to the anatomical facts. Immediately external to the outer margin of the rectus the aponeurosis of the transversalis becomes intimately united with a portion of that of the internal oblique, and the united tendons sweep downwards and inwards towards the linea alba behind the rectus muscle as a single structure. Below the semilunar fold this sheath, while distinct and easily separated from the transver- salis fascia behind it, is comparatively thin. It presents, however, a very constant arrangement of its fibres. Braune,t who has described the lower portion of the posterior wall of the rectus sheath, talks of it as if it were formed of the aponeurosis of * Quain's Anatomy. 9th edit.

Report, Made to this Academy, in the Sitting of the 22d October, 1839, ON THK PREPARATIONS OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY MODELLED AND PUBLISHED BY DR. FELIX THIBERT, (author of a new method), By a Commission composed of MM, Andral, Professor of General Pathology to the Faculty of Medicine, Paris; Breschet, Member of the Academy of Sciences, and Professor of Anatomy to the same Faculty: Cruveilhier, Professor of Anatomy to the same Faculty, Reporter, Gentlemen, You have commissioned MM. Andral, Breschet, and myself, to make a report to you respecting the Preparations of Pathological Anatomy modelled in relief, and published by Dr. Felix Thibert. The task you have assigned to us will be an easy one, both from the nature of the subject, which allows of each member of the Academy appreciating at a glance the importance of this mode of repre-4 seating morbid Lesions, and also from the merit of these models, which affords to your Commission the rare opportunity of bestowing praise without rendering any tribute to mere complaisance or flattery. If the utility of Plates or Models, as applied to the anatomy of healthy organs, has been questioned — if we have been enabled with Bichat to designate them as but the displays of luxury, or to regard them as mere beautiful exteriors covering a perfect blank—there is no one who can possibly call in question not merely their utility but their actual necessity in pathological anatomy. Here the op- portunities for observation are fleeting, and those appearances which have been seen but once are readily forgotten, especially where, as in this case, but too frequently a mere glance has been obtained. A description, however well, seemingly, it may be made, is a wearisome task, as it proceeds from one detail to another in the endeavour to picture to the mind an image which it always renders incomplete, sometimes obscure and unintelligible, and which is frequently disfigured in its details by the predomi- nance of the one chief feature of the case. Practices even of the most extensive kind rarely furnish cas'es which are exactly analogous, and which could thus mutually serve to throw light on each other. A faithful representation of original objects is in some measure as eternal as nature itself: secure from the5 vacillations of the spirit of system, it reproduces unceasingly the same image : it recals to the re- membrance of one an object he has already seen, and it teaches another what he was in ignorance of before; it dispenses with all fastidious lectures, and leaves on the mind an impression as strong as it will be lasting. How many framers of hypotheses, so clear and so positive in a description the materials of which have been furnished by their imaginations alone, have been convicted in their ignorance, their error, and their falsity, by the silent yet indisputable evidence of the very figure which they had referred to as affording support to their doctrine. It is not with pathological as it is with physiolo- gical anatomy. In the latter the observer is enabled to contemplate the various organs and parts at his leisure, and he can moreover reproduce them at will. The appearances which he has once witnessed in them he can see a second, a third, or even a twentieth time; and it is thus that the knowledge of the ana- tomy of healthy organs has been enabled to progress with such rapid strides as to have attained its present state of perfection. In pathological anatomy, on the contrary, an opportunity for observation once lost is perhaps never regained : and nothing is more evanescent than the objects presented to the eye of an observer in this department of science. If he does not speedily fix, by some means, the fleeting character of such objects, so that he may at any6 luluic time be enabled to represent them anew, to compare them with analogous facts, and to awaken in his own mind the same feelings, the same ideas which he entertained at the time when he first exa- mined these objects, he will possess but isolated facts and mere reminiscences, which he will be un- able to compare and reconcile with each other : con- sequently he will not possess the true science of the subject; and I but adopt the language of the im- mortal Morgagni, when I say that I consider this to be the principal cause of the little progress we have yet made in our knowledge regarding the causes and seat of diseases. These considerations will serve to justify the fa- vour with which your Commission feel it to be their duty to receive a new mode of representing patholo- gical specimens, which combines the advantages of solidity and durability with those of the fidelity of representations in wax. To which may be added, that the trifling cost of these models enables them to a certain extent to come within the reach of men of all fortunes : moreover, they are capable of being multiplied almost indefinitely. The unchangeable nature of the material of which these models are composed will allow also of their being serv iceable for courses of lectures on pathology in a no less degree than to pathological anatomy, and will offer the immense advantage of enabling the alterations of organs to be considered in relation to the symptoms by7 which such alterations are accustomed to announce themselves, with the causes which have led to their production, and with the therapeutical indications. This same unalterable nature allows also of these models being taken to all parts of the globe, almost without the necessity of any precaution being adopted for their preservation ; and it insures moreover their keeping for any length of time. Under such considerations your Commission thinks that the artificial preparations of M. Thibert ought to form an essential part of every museum of patho- logical anatomy, either as an addition to real pre- parations, or even to replace them : they might be substituted with advantage for most of the prepara- tions in wax. The very extraordinary perfection to which M. Thibert has attained in the art of making these models proves that he must have been endowed with great natural talent, and have laboured long and perseveringly to accomplish his end. Moreover, it evinces the possession of considerable knowledge in the art of painting, sculpture, and modelling. The various colours in these models are so well contrived, and so perfectly natural, as to have led to these arti- ficial preparations being mistaken for natural speci- mens of pathological anatomy. One of our colleagues was deceived in this way, mistaking a model for a real portion of diseased intestine. I am informed on good authority, that M. Thibert having gone this8 year to the scientific congress in Germany, many clever anatomists there, to whom he submitted his artificial preparations, imagined at first that they were real organs and parts preserved, and they begged he would acquaint them with the method he had adopted for their preservation. It is understood that this method of so very faithfully representing morbid lesions has created considerable sensation in Germany, and that many of the Professors in the Universities of that country are about to request that their go- vernment should purchase the collection of models published by M. Thibert. Already, acting in accordance with the advice of the Royal Council of Public Instruction, and fore- seeing to a certain extent the decision of the Academy, has the minister set the example, and requested the prefects of departments to invite the attention of general and local councils to the models of M.Thibert, which, deposited in the libraries of the faculties and secondary schools, would be placed at the disposal of practitioners and pupils. Your Commission is of opinion that the Academy ought to respond in the most favourable manner to the letter in which the Minister requests its opinion respecting these models of M. Thibert, and to state that it would be highly advantageous for the purposes of instruction that each Faculty and each secondary school of medicine should possess the collection.9 Your Commission is also of opinion that it is im- possible to encourage too highly, a method which so faithfully represents the character of morbid lesions. Moreover, it believes that it would be right to request M. Thibert to apply his admirable talents not merely to the reproduction of the general forms of morbid lesions, but also to the study of the anatomy of texture of diseased organs.

Paris, 22d October, 1839.ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.—INSTITUTE OF FR'ANCE. 1840. Report BY MM. BRESCHET, DUMERIL, MAGENDIE, SERRES, ROUX, LARREY, DE BLATNVILLE, SAVART, DOUBLE (Reporter). The Models of Pathological Anatomy published by M. Thibert, which are formed by an entirely new process, promise new and important advantages to art and science. In preserving faithfully the chief external characters of a considerable number of diseases for the purposes of teaching and of studying pathology, and in re- presenting with the greatest accuracy the various alterations of tissues, M. Thibert has rendered true service to the science of medicine. The appearances presented by morbid lesions are so variable and so fleeting, that it has long been an object of great importance so to preserve them that they may be at any time reproduced : for the attain- ment of this desirable object at first written descrip-11 tions were employed, then the aid of drawing and engraving was called into requisition; still later the plan of' preserving the anatomical specimens themselves in various ways was adopted, and lastly a mode of making imitations of them in wax has been pursued. It was a French surgeon, Guillaume Desnoues by name, a professor at Genoa, and a distinguished pupil of Malpighi, who first conceived the idea of reproducing, by means of wax, the forms and colours of the various parts of human anatomy. He availed himself of the assistance of a clever Sicilian modeller, Gaetano Guilo Zumbo, an abbot of Syracuse, to carry this project into execution. Our Academy of Sciences, which has always been ready to afford encouragement to inventions likely to be profitable to the medical sciences, praised this enterprise highly, and lost no time in bestowing its approbation on the inventor. This took place in the year 1701. But all these various processess for representing the characters of anatomical specimens had many imperfections and inconveniences. A written description is rarely faithful, and is generally borrowed from the doctrines of the day, and modified according to the systematic opinions of the author. Besides, on a subject of this kind, it is essential that nature herself should have been diligently studied, before much real success can12 possibly attend the perusal of descriptions given in books. Representations by drawing and engraving have this great objection, that they are apt to bear upon them the expression of the artists' ideas or precon- ceived notions. Moreover, there is a kind of vague- ness and indecision attached to them : for, on the one hand, we perhaps observe scarcely any thing but plain surfaces, while on the other hand the colours employed to represent the shades are seldom exactly those of the original specimens. With regard to those specimens preserved ana- tomically, it must be observed that they afford but very mediocre assistance to study. Their colour disappears; they become altered in form; the spe- cimens cannot be multiplied, and it is as difficult to touch as to obtain a good view of them. Models in wax also too often bear upon them the impress of the artists' imagination. To be well executed these preparations require considerable time: they are apt to change rapidly in form and colour ; great care is also requisite in handling them, and removing them from one place to another. All these are serious objections to this mode of repre- senting the characters of objects. The method adopted by M. Thibert remedies almost all these defects. In a few moments, the form, the various prominences and depressions, the colour and different shades of the anatomical speci-13 men, are all taken with the most perfect accuracy, copied with the most rigorous exactness, and in fact are entirely reproduced. Owing to the great solidity of the " carton-pate" the models combine all the advantages of the varied, natural, lively, and durable characters of the best paintings. It is hardly necessary to observe that the artist can multiply the number of casts to any extent, all with the most perfect accuracy : such preparations combine also the recommendations of convenience of transport and reasonableness in cost. The preparations of M. Thibert have already ob- tained the sanction of the Royal Academy of Medi- cine, of the Royal Council of Public Instruction, and of the Faculty of Medicine. The Commission for the Monthyon Prize will, however, limit itself at present simply to recommending these preparations to the Academy. Before awarding to M. Thibert the prize of the generous testator, the Commission has judged it advisable to wait until these models shall have been applied to a greater number of dis- eases, to all cutaneous affections, for instance, and thus their utility become more practical; and until, more numerous, more varied, and more extended, they shall have rendered other services to the teaching both of special anatomy and of pathological anatomy.SOCIETY FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF NATIONAL INDUSTRY. L848. Report BY MM. PAYEN, GIIERIN, CHEVALIER, & BUSSY (Re All discoveries and improvements which have re- ference to objects of daily consumption, and the advantages or merits of which every one has an op- portunity of appreciating, usually bring their recom- pense with them, and the favour of the public is not tardy in indemnifying the authors of them for the expense and trouble to which they have been neces- sarily exposed. There are other discoveries, on the contrary, which, without being actually less impor- tant, are yet of a less immediate utility and applica- tion, and which, in order to produce the advantages which it is but right to expect from them, require the distinguished support of learned bodies, and the encouragement of societies instituted for the purpose of promoting the progress and developement of useful undertakings. To this latter class belongs the method undertaken by M. Thibert for the production of models designed15 to represent the characters of various morbid lesions. A profound knowledge of the alterations which our organs undergo in the course of different diseases, is, without doubt, one of the most essential elements for the rational treatment of these same diseases : and for this reason the study of patho- logical anatomy has become one of the chief points in medical instruction. But instruction in this branch is singularly im- peded by the difficulty experienced in being able to present at the time when wanted, those specimens which form the subject of instruction,—specimens which can be but casually and transiently procured. This is not the case in the study of normal anatomy : here we have always the opportunity and facility of preparing muscles, vessels, and other parts which may be required to form the subject of de- monstration ; when, on the contrary, it is desired to describe the abnormal alterations of a tissue,—altera- tions perhaps very rare,«—it is not only essential to find a subject which presents these alterations, it is also necessary that the dissections should be made at a right time: it is necessary that death, that putrefaction (which is always rapid) should not have caused the disappearance of those essential characters on which it is of importance to fix the attention of those being instructed. These diffi- culties, which have long been felt, have led to thehi suggestion of different modes of preserving these specimens, in order to supply the insufficiency of oral descriptions. These methods chiefly consist in the employment of alcohol, or solutions of substances which possess the power of preventing putrefaction : but it is enough to cast a glance over a collection of objects of this kind, to appreciate all the imperfections of this mode of preservation, by which not merely the forms of parts are altered, but also their colours, which are such important features in the subject now occupying our attention. It is in vain that we expect from an engraving, even a coloured engraving, a faithful representation of pathological specimens ; the necessity of repre- senting all the shaded parts, and the contours of the objects, by means of dark colours, in order to give them suitable relief, modifies very sensibly the tint peculiar to each part, and this is highly prejudicial to their study. What description, what drawing could replace this facsimile, which you have before your eyes, of the alterations produced by glanders in man ? It is true that we find in many well supplied museums, preparations in wax, which leave nothing to be desired as regards the faithful representation of nature ; but these objects (which are always very expensive) do not usually possess sufficient firmness to admit of their being intrusted to those who would17 take an interest in examining into all their details ; moreover, their high price will always render them too scarce to allow of being habitually made use of in a course of lectures, or even for particular study. M. Thibert has succeeded in doing away with these several inconveniences. The models of pathological anatomy which he presents to the society are cast in moulds, prepared with the greatest possible care, from nature : the material of which they are made is a firm and solid composition: the colours are excellent, and apparently unalterable by time. This method, which implies, on the part of the inventor, a perfect knowledge of anatomy, together with great skill as a designer, painter, and modelist, may now be executed by common workmen, who can be readily instructed in the process. It has already acquired sufficient importance to lead to the em- ployment of from twelve to fifteen workmen daity. We will not speak of the merit of these models in a medical point of view, for their exactness, as well as their scientific utility, have been duly appreciated 1>\ very competent judges in this branch of science. MM. Anclral, Breschet, and Cruveilhier, who, in a report to the Academy of Medicine, October 22nd, 1839, observe, "Our task will be an easy one, both from the nature of the subject, which allows of each member of the Academy appreciating at a glance the importance of this mode of representing morbid lesions, and also from the merit of these models,18 which furnishes to your commission the rare oppor- tunity of bestowing praise without rendering any tribute to mere complaisance or flattery." We will add, that the Minister of Public Instruction, acting in accordance with the favourable opinion of the Royal Council, has authorized and encouraged the adoption of M. Thibert's models of pathological anatomy for the purposes of medical instruction. Already has a large number of these models become distributed over France, and they are to be found in the several faculties and provincial schools of medicine, both in this country and abroad. Thus the medical and scientific world, which is indebted to G. F. Desnoues for the first models in wax, will also owe to one of our countrymen the utmost per- fection to which this branch of art appears capable of attaining.— From these various considerations, the council of administration has awarded a platinum medal to M. Thibert.OF THE PRODUCTS OF FRENCH INDUSTRY IN 1839. REPORT OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. M. Thibert having conceived the idea of re- presenting specimens of pathological anatomy by means of casts from moulds prepared from nature, has greatly benefited science. These models, which represent the natural appearances of parts most faithfully, are coloured with great care, and are fixed upon frames composed of the same material as the models themselves. We have observed with great interest a series of preparations designed to illustrate the lesions caused by glanders in the nasal fossae of the horse, also the horrible ravages which this affection is capable of producing in man, to whom the malady is contagious; we have also noticed with interest a collection representing the alterations of the mucous membrane of the alimen- tary canal in various affections, especially in cases of poisoning, in which latter point of view these20 models will be of the greatest utility in the study of toxicology. Tubercles, excrescences, tumours, ulcerations of various kinds, are all represented with an accuracy tculy fearful to persons unacquainted with the sciences of medicine, yet most valuable to those engaged in the study of this profession. The firmness of these models renders them to a certain extent unalterable, and, on this account, affords to them great superiority over preparations in wax; the facility with which the proofs may be multiplied allows also of their being offered in commerce at a reasonable price. These models will be of the greatest possible use for the purposes of instruction, and will become indispensable in uni- versities of medicine. M. Thibert has deserved highly from both science and art: he has effected for pathological anatomy what M. Anzou has for normal anatomy: he is worthy, therefore, of the same amount of encourage- ment. The committee, considering that this ingenious contrivance of M. Thibert is yet but in its infancy (July 1839), and that, if encouraged, it is capable of attaining to great development, awards to him a silver medal.OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE FINE ARTS AND OF INDUSTRY, IN THE GALLERIES OF THE CAPITOL, TOULOUSE. 1840. Descriptions, however exact, however detailed they may be, are insufficient to perpetuate the re- membrance of the various alterations of which our organs are susceptible. One can never, from them, form an exact idea of lesions which have existed, and it is with some show of reason that to this cause has been attributed the little progress which the science of pathological anatomy had made, up to the end of the eighteenth century. One feels, then, the necessity of preserving the characters of these alterations, either by putting the specimens up as preparations, or by making models of them in wax ; and in spite of the imperfections of both these two processes, they yet offer a certain amount of utility which has been applied to the advantage of science. But, for the attainment of the desired end, two indications required to be fulfilled: in the first place, it was essential to piace these preparations at the command of men of all fortunes (an advantage22 which the preparations in wax did not offer) ; in the second place, it was necessary to make them so firm and solid that they might be made use of in the studies of a number of pupils, without any fear of their original form and characters being lost. It must be admitted that these two indications have never been properly fulfilled. M. Thibert, a doctor of medicine in Paris, has engaged in numerous researches into the best mode of preparing and imitating specimens of pathological anatomy. He has invented a substance by means of which he can represent in models, with the most perfect fidelity, all the characters of the various lesions of which our organs are susceptible. In the preparations of aneurism of the heart, cancer of the pylorus, typhoid enteritis, hepatization of the lung, &c, the committee were struck with the degree of accuracy and resemblance to nature which these models exhibited. These figures represent the exact volume, prominences, and colours of nature : with these advantages they combine another, which has never yet been offered by any other process, viz. the property of being uninjured by exposure to the action of moisture, of rain, or even of the sun. The committee have thought fit to award again to M. Thibert the silver medal which he obtained last year at the General Exposition of the Products of Industry.PRIZE IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY. Report OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF FRANCE, ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. Commissioners: MM. Breschet, Serres,Dumkril, Larrey, Magendie, Roux, De Blainville, Velpeau, Pariset, Andral, Reporter. 1844. If it be certain that the progress of medicine is due in great measure to the care with which, for the two last centuries especially, the alterations impressed by disease on our organs have been studied, we ought to receive with favour the various efforts made to represent these alterations, of which suitable descrip- tions have never been sufficient to convey an exact idea, especially to those who have not been in a position to see the object described. On this ac- count, the models of pathological anatomy made by M. Thibert ought to be considered as a work pecu- liarly fitted to benefit medicine and surgery, and to assist in the progress of these sciences. After having represented the required specimens by coloured drawings (the perfect accuracy of which the Commission has had an opportunity of appre- ciating), he moulds them; into these moulds he pours a composition analogous to " carton-pierre/'24 and then he applies his colours to the casts so ob- tained : in this way, the specimens are reproduced in the most exact manner possible, both in regard to form, relief, and colour. The Commission are - convinced that these models will undergo the test of time without any deterioration : any number of proofs may be obtained from each mould, and the price is considerably less than that of preparations in wax. The Commission have examined with care M. Thibert's collection : they have been struck with the fidelity with which the subjects are represented even in their most minute details j' such, for example, as diseases of the skin, those of the mucous membranes, especially the alterations undergone by the intestinal follicles in typhoid fever, a large number of affections of the brain, of the liver, the lungs, the genito-urinary organs, and the osseous system. They are con- vinced that there are hardly any alterations which disease can produce on our organs that may not be represented by this process of M. Thibert, and that, independently of the utility which might result from it for the individual instruction of medical men, the theoretical and practical teaching of patho- logy also ought to derive a great advantage from it. Wherefore, the Commission propose to the academy to grant to M. Thibert the recompense of 4,000 francs for his artificial preparations of pathological anatomy: Monthyon prize.iftmfeterfal <&vtin\ To the Prefect. The Royal Council of Public Instruction has ex- pressed its opinion that it would be useful for the purposes of instruction to place in the libraries of the faculties and provincial schools of medicine, the preparations of pathological anatomy, modelled and published by Dr. Felix Thibert. In accordance with this opinion, I feel it my duty to request that you, Sir, will invite the attention of the General Council of your department, or the municipal council of your locality, to these models published by Dr. Thibert: you will find me dis- posed to request of my colleague, the Minister of the Interior, to approve of the allowance of such sums as may be voted for the purchase of this col- lection, which would be deposited in the libraries or museums, and be placed at the disposal of the prac- titioners and pupils.

Lecturer on Anatomy, Corresponding Member of the French Academy of Medicine, and Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. Lo?idon, July 29, 1845. Dear Sir, It will no doubt be in your recollection, that when I first had the pleasure of seeing your splendid mu- seum of pathology, and of pathological anatomy, composed of models in relief, made after a process invented by yourself, and coloured after nature, I told you unhesitatingly that in my opinion this im- portant discovery of yours went far to solve, if it did not do so entirely, a problem of great and increasing difficulty, namely, what was to be done with the existing pathological museums ? On stating this my opinion to you frankly and candidly, and enter- ing further into details, you were pleased to observe that the opinion I had just given coincided with those expressed by the highest continental autho- rities; a fact of which I was not in the least aware until you put into my hands your publication en- titled "Musee d'Anatomie Pathologie," Prix Mon-27 thyon : Paris, 1844. This coincidence of opinion has given me very great pleasure. By it I discovered that a few years ago, and nearly about the same period, practical men in France and in Britain had begun to see that the existing pathological museums were a failure, in despite of the almost inconceivable efforts made by scientific men for their support. By it I learned that the opinion I had formed of the value of your discovery coincided with the opinion of those anatomists and pathologists, MM. de Blain- ville, Cruveilhier, Chornel, Breschet, Lisfranc, Ma- gendie, and many others, for whom I entertain the profoundest regard and esteem; more especially for that of my most honoured friend and teacher, M. De Blainville, to whose position as a scientific man I need not advert. You next did me the honour to request me to state in writing the sentiments I delivered on a first and second inspection of the museum 5 and having deliberately and carefully revised the whole, I do not hesitate inclosing to you the subjoined report. I have the honour to be, my dear Sir, With great regard and esteem, Very faithfully, your obedient servant, R. Knox. To Dr. Fetw Tin her I.28 REPORT. Long prior, no doubt, to the time when the illus- trious Morgagni published his immortal work, " De Sedibus et Causis Morborum," physicians and surgeons had felt the importance of possessing some record, besides that of mere description, of the results of practice, and of changes inflicted by disease on the textures and organs of the human body. This led, unquestionably, to the formation as well by corporate bodies or colleges, from national or general funds, as by public-spirited individuals at their own proper cost, of those expensive, and, as it now ap- pears, nearly useless appendages of medical science, viz. museums or collections of the diseased organs and textures of man, preserved in a great variety of ways; some by immersion in alcoholic liquor, more or less diluted ; others in various other liquids, differ- ing from, and generally less costly than, alcohol; whilst numerous specimens of diseased structures were attempted to be preserved in a dried or some- what natural state, prepared, dissected, and varnished, so as,at last, like those immersed in preservative liquids, to lose all resemblance to truth and nature. Such attempts, however, must have been of a late date when compared with the formation of museums or collec- tions for the teaching the elementary normal anatomy29 and physiology of man and animals. These existed in Egypt even in the time of Galen. But it was in Holland and in England, where the cumulative spirit, added to a love of science, first gave rise to collections of any great magnitude. For a time, however rich, these were mere collections of speci- mens illustrating healthy and diseased anatomy of man and animals; their physiology and comparative anatomy, — together with some rare objects of zoology, or natural history generally; hence arose the splendid collections of Ruysch,Bonn,Lieberkuhn, Albinus, Zeba, and a host of others in Holland; in Britain, Dr. William Hunter and his school, and the first and second Monro, followed in the train of their French and Dutch teachers. France was not idle in these respects, and Germany could boast of many excellent and rich collections. At last two persons appeared whose genius gave a precise and determinate direction to such collections : Mr. John Hunter, in England, was the first to form a museum of anatomy and physiology as distinguished from a mere collection ; his immortal work, placed by government in the Hall of the Royal College of Sur- geons in London, speaks for itself: in France, Baron Cuvier followed, laying the foundation of a museum of comparative anatomy, an extension of the idea of Mr. Hunter on a grander scale, backed by a munificent government fond of science and of scientific men. What these great men did for human and compara- tive anatomy and physiology, Dr. Mathew Baillie30 attempted lor pathological anatomy; that is, he first formed it into a science, and endeavoured to preserve records, scientifically arranged, of its objects, by drawings, descriptions, wax and plaster models, and, last of all, by preserving the diseased organs and tex- tures themselves. Numerous collections of diseased organs existed no doubt prior to Dr. Baillie's time; he first systematized them, and was the founder of sys- tematic pathology and pathological anatomy. More lately, Baron Dupuytren founded a similar museum in Paris, which bears his name. I shall speak presently of the attempts and efforts made in this country, and throughout civilized Europe, to extend these ideas,—I mean to form extensive and useful pathological museums : all these efforts have failed, or must inevitably do so, from the nature of the objects attempted to be preserved. Their support has been, with few exceptions, disastrous to their founders, causing them enormous pecuniary losses; those who have escaped such losses by the sale of their collections at a fortunate moment to two public bodies, were the second Dr. Monro and Sir Charles Bell; all the others, as I shall afterwards shew, suffered extremely heavy losses. Ten thousand pounds, being not a third of what it cost the founder, were paid, though with great reluctance, by the British Government, to Mr. John Hunter's family, for his museum, which, as a work of genius, is perhaps without a parallel in the world. This brief outline will explain to those not familiar31 with, such matters the history of the larger and best known museums : nor ought I to pass over in silence the great and praiseworthy efforts of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh in founding and supporting the most extensive Pathological Museum in Britain. I was their first Conservator, and know well and intimately the history of that collection; every preparation in it has many times passed through my hands, and the small Museum of Comparative Anatomy, composed of the skeletons of the four classes of the Vertebrata, was made by my brother under my own inspection. This public-spirited body cannot have expended less than £10,000 in connection with its museums, which yet contain scarcely a single specimen illustrative of Cutaneous, Syphilitic, or Eye Disease. But a few years had elapsed when it was dis- covered that the pathological sections of these museums did not efficiently supply the wants of science and of art. The practical physi- cian and surgeon required that external ap- pearances of disease should be frequently and faith- fully brought before him, in order to improve his diagnostic, to learn something new, and to benefit by the labours of his predecessors; the same prac- titioners in the arts of physic and surgery requiring to refer to the effects of disease on the organs, did not find, in the specimens preserved in alcohol, the exact appearances they had been led to expect;32 all the natural colouring had disappeared ; oC the textures some had been hardened, others softened; semiliquid parts had become solid, and vice versa ; the preparation, in fact, had, in most instances, lost all resemblance to the original, and could scarcely be recognised even by the most expert anatomist. Lec- turers on morbid anatomy, medicine, and surgery, made, of course, similar objections ; still stronger, perhaps, in their case, since they were forced to add that the museums were of little or no use to them as teachers. Students obviously could learn little or nothing by frequenting museum, from which all external appearances of disease are as it were excluded; practitioners of all classes ceased to take an interest in them ; the private collections throughout the empire were sold at a ruinous loss to the public-spirited individuals who had formed them ; public museums, or those belong- ing to colleges and other corporate bodies, trenched so deeply on the revenues of these colleges that in all instances these institutions have been forced to apply to Government for pecuniary aid in supporting col- lections which, without such aid, would speedily have crushed their establishments*. * The extremely obnoxious and oppressive clause introduced into the amended Physic and Surgery Bill now before Parliament— a clause enacting and compelling every medical man, even after he shall have become a legally qualified general practitioner, equal to the conducting of any case, to enter notwithstanding one or other of33 But previous to the discovery and avowal of this great failure, the medical faculty generally, collec- tively and individually, had made the greatest efforts imaginable to render the existing museums useful. To the preparations preserved in alcoholic liquids, and prepared by cleaning, drying, and varnishing, they added, in some instances, models or representa- tions in wax, hoping thereby to exhibit the specimen with its original colours and form; and finally, a last effort was made, to make up for the obvious failure in the natural preparations preserved in alcohol or dried and varnished, by the most costly drawings in oil and water colours, subsequently engraved or lithographed by the first artists. Of these two methods of supplying the deficiencies in the original mode of setting up morbid specimens in spirituous liquors, I shall here say a few words. 1. Representations of disease and of diseased struc- tures by drawings, whether in oil or otherwise, leave on the mind only the vaguest recollections. They have in consequence altogether failed. Students will scarcely look at them. Junior medical men feel that they afford them little or no solid information. One the Royal Colleges of Surgeons or Physicians, paying to these cor- porate bodies excessive and exorbitant fees; this clause, which no doubt will and ought to meet with the strongest opposition from most medical men, has been inserted into the amended Bill mainly for the providing a fund to support museums which are of no benefit whatever to the public or to the profession. D34 gentleman alone expended, it is said, fully 20O0Z. on drawings in water-colours of every possible form of disease, and every variety of pathological derange- ment of structure. Here was an experiment on a great scale, and the result has been a total failure: the practical man knows that he can derive no solid benefit from the inspection of such drawings; the student feels that they form but a miserable substi- tute for the reality. No one will again, I trust, be foolish enough to repeat such an effort. In my younger days (1816) I paid to Mr. Charpentier, of Portsmouth, four guineas for a single coloured drawing of a necrosed bone, which drawing neither teaches nor instructs. If the preparation itself exist it may now be worth half a crown : the drawing is of no value what- ever. Still anxious to record the leading patholo- gical facts as they occurred, I employed, in 1821, a French artist to make for me three coloured drawings of a very valuable preparation of necrosed collar- bone (perhaps quite unique), presented originally, nearly a century ago, by D'Angerville to the Academy of Medicine, and transferred by them to the museums of the faculty. This preparation I had seen very roughly handled by the Professor of Surgery at a com- mon demonstration to a class of Parisian students; and dreading lest in process of time it might disappear, or be otherwise injured, I caused a French artist to make for me three coloured drawings. These draw- ings cost me nearly 100 francs, and my present35 opinion is, that they are not of the smallest value. But these circumstances were absolutely trifling compared with the efforts of others and of myself at this particular time. Thousands of pounds were expended in attempting to represent faithfully patho- logical appearances during life, and morbid altera- tions of the human organs, in such a way as to be useful to science. To the student, to the teacher, to the practitioner, the result was uniformly a com- plete and entire failure.* 2. Baffled in this attempt, modelling in wax, as the nearest approach to nature, was also attempted. This promised to be more successful; and it cannot be denied that some extremely beautiful models in relief have been formed in wax. What, then, are the * A remarkable instance of the inadequacy of drawings to convey any just idea of pathological appearances, occurred, a few years ago, under my own observation. A farm-servant, labouring under the very worst form of acute glanders, or button-farcy, was brought into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The case was treated as one of ery- sipelas of the scalp and face, none of the attending medical men, though quite familiar with drawings of the formidable disease in ques- tion, having been skilful enough to recognize it during life, nor after death either, until their attention was called to the circumstance some ten or twelve days afterwards by the sheriff of the county, who had instituted an inquiry into the circumstances of the case. A single specimen from Dr. Thibert's museum, placed in the museum of the hospital, would at least have prevented the dangerous error committed in the diagnosis. During the post-mortem examination the attending physicians refused to listen to an observation I made, namely, that the appearances were not those of erysipelas, but were wholly new to me.36 objections to forming the chief bulk of museums of pathology and of pathological anatomy in wax p They are numerous, and in some measure insur- mountable. First, the heavy expense attending their formation. These models cannot be multiplied excepting in the same expensive way, and they must not be handled : they must be preserved under glass with the greatest care. And lastly, their colours alter, in spite of every effort. Thus models in wax can never form a useful museum, nor replace effec- tually the present pathological preparations. They cannot be multiplied at a trifling expense, like those of Dr. Thibert: they cannot, like his, be extended to every county hospital in the kingdom, and every naval and military hospital of our colonies: they cannot be made to benefit humanity to the same extent. Now this relief to suffering humanity is avowedly the great object of all medical science and art, and on this I with confidence base my opinion that the discovery of Dr. Thibert merits the attention and the support of all Governments. Thus we have seen that neither mere description, nor drawings, nor wax models, have been found to answer; but in respect of the collections formed chiefly of the diseased organs themselves, a glance at the existing museums, with a very brief outline of their history, and of other valuable collections now dispersed, and as it were ruined and gone down, will satisfy any unprejudiced person that the whole sys-37 tern, or very nearly the whole system, must be suffered to fall into abeyance. By immersion in spirituous liquors nearly every morbid structure is destroyed; all colour disappears; the very forms cannot in consequence be made out; the glass and its contained fluid magnify the structures grotesquely; the structure itself cannot be handled; the expense of getting up, restoring, preserving, are positively endless and ruinous. Lastly, when so prepared, the preparation is seldom or ever of any use: ultimately these preparations go down altogether. Such has been the fate of all the private collections I have known: magnificent efforts of public-spirited men, struggling with difficulties not to be overcome. Such has been the fate of the Brookes' collection—of those formed by Messrs. Heaviside, Langstaff, John Lizars, Macintosh, and myself. Such a result, I have been told, awaits the collection of Meckel. The patholo- gical museum I saw in Holland presented exactly the same difficulties. The expense of main- taining the pathological museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh has already strongly attracted the attention of its members; its inutility to medical science, to the student, to the lecturer, to the profession, has now been put beyond all doubt. The necessity, then, for the discontinuance of such efforts on the part of individuals, and of public or corporate bodies, is no longer a question; and accordingly every large private collection has38 disappeared : the smaller ones merit no notice. As nature is everywhere the same, the Museum Dupuy- tren must, sooner or later, share the same fate. That there are morbid structures which anatomists may continue still to preserve, after the usual mode, T will not deny. Every practical man can readily recollect and select such structures; but by far the greater number of diseased structures, and nearly all pathology, must be represented in a totally different manner to what has been done hitherto. To Dr. F. Thibert we owe the discovery of a substitute at once efficient, economical, and practical. But to under- stand the nature of the museum of models in relief brought into this country by Dr. Thibert, it is ne- cessary that it be seen and inspected; then alone can its full value and importance be distinctly under- stood. By its means, as has been already so ably explained by M. Cruveilhier and others, in their reports to the Institute, and to the Academy of Me- dicine, all pathological appearances, and all morbid structures, can be represented as in life, or nearly so, and at a comparatively trifling cost. The material used is hard, unalterable by climate, and the colours indelible. They can be multiplied from the moulds to any extent, and thus diffused through the hos- pitals of the kingdom, transmitted to the colonies, placed in all the great military and naval, and county hospitals, in the colleges and medical academies; extend, in short, where science or humanity demands39 their presence. Pathological museums have scarcely benefited humanity: the museum of Dr. Thibert will, on the contrary, be of essential service to the public if distributed in the way I have mentioned. Thus will government and the wealthy carry into the pro- vinces the means of instruction to every class of practitioners, raising them at last, it is to be hoped, to one class of practical men, fully competent to any difficult case. Errors in judgment, arising often from a want of means of comparison, will gradually become rare; and the labouring poor, crushed down by the sternness of their fate, will then be cared for on the bed of sickness by medical men, of whom it can- not be said that they have lacked the means of con- tinued improvement. Of all classes of society surely it is the labouring classes to whom sound health is of the greatest importance. Health and strength is their capital; deprived of this they perish. It is the duty of every Christian government to provide the highest medical assistance to the labouring poor; the wealthy can provide for themselves. To return to the pathological museum of M. Thibert, T feel confident that pathologists will find that it fully merits all the praises bestowed on it by the first Continental anatomists; as a practical man, and an ardent pathologist of at least thirty years' standing, I do not hesitate subscribing to these opinions. There will, no doubt, be many (including, perhaps, myself) who may still be inclined to pre-10 serve in an economical mode, and not for exhibition, certain pathological structures for the sake of science and of after-examination; but this view is strictly compatible, and may co-exist with, the models of M. Thibert. In the preceding Report, I have, of course, said nothing of the application of M. Thibert's discovery to the representation of healthy and normal structure. As a teacher of anatomy, I hold in abhorrence all attempts by papier-mache machines, wax or plaster models, or by any similar contrivance, to represent the healthy human structure. They are calculated to favour indolence, to substitute the unreal for the real when the real can alone be useful. No sound anatomist, it is to be hoped, will ever sanction the use of such machines or models in the study of single descriptive anatomy*. My inspection of this great work has been as yet but hasty and imperfect; still, I have seen enough to cause in me deep regret that the method of Dr. Thibert had not been many years ago introduced into this country. A few concluding observations may, I hope, excite the interest of medical men whose distance from the capital prevents a personal inspec- tion ; for their accuracy I can only offer as a voucher * It is much to be regretted that the Honourable the East India Company sanctioned the use of papier-mache machines for the teaching normal anatomy ; I sincerely trust the Indian anatomists make no use of them.41 my long experience in such matters, and the con- fidential situations I have held. 1st. Whilst I deprecate the employment of this or any other similar method, to represent normal struc- tures in human anatomy, or comparative anatomy, I feel disposed to recommend the representation by models in relief of all dangerous varieties of the great arteries; the history of Mr. John Shaw's un- fortunate case of lithotomy recals forcibly to my mind the importance of such preparation or models. I need not recal to the recollection of British surgeons what unjustifiable remarks were made on Mr. Shaw's operation, all which could easily have been avoided and prevented had the museum of the hospital possessed, as it ought to have, the varieties of the arteries properly preserved, or, what is much better, represented by the models of M. Thibert. 2d. The most instructive pathological appearances, occurring rarely and at extremely uncertain intervals, have been completely lost to science, owing to the difficulty, not to say impossibility, of duly preserving them by any of the recognized methods. I had in- tended to mention a few, but this seems unnecessary, since every practical man must have seen hundreds of such cases. Even when so prepared a valuable pre- paration, being single, is lost to the scientific world. I remember visiting Paris on one occasion almost solely for the purpose of examining the necrosed42 scapula of a horse at that time in the Museum of Alfort. 3d. The models in relief of Dr. Thibert seem to me of inestimable value in representing uterine diseases and affections; here their use must greatly benefit humanity, by improving the diagnostic, and, as a consequence, the boldness, and certainty, and security of remedial means. 4th. By means of these models, general hospitals, wherever placed, dispensaries, and public museums, will become extensively beneficial to the public; and they will give confidence to all classes on it being shewn them that in post-mortem examinations it was no longer necessary to preserve any remains of the dead; that all the organs, in fact, maybe consigned to the tomb, and yet a valuable record be preserved. 5th. On returning after a few months to look at the mordid specimens put up in the usual way in spirits, all anatomists must have felt, what has so often occurred to myself, the deepest chagrin on finding that our efforts, together with enormous expenses, had been completely thrown away; that the specimen was perhaps scarcely recognizable even by the most expert; nay, what is more, it is only necessary to look at the models in relief now in Dr. Thibert's museum, shewing the various malposi- tions of the uterus, to be convinced that by no effort of his skill can the anatomist here rival, or even ap-43 proach, in accuracy of representation, these models, by any mode he may adopt in preserving the original structures. 6th. Some diseases, conjectured to be malignant and apt to spread, have been of late proved not to do so; the value of such an opinion is lost, or con- fined to a few men practising in large towns, unless spread abroad by museums formed on this plan. 7th. The representation of the diseases of the eyes and skin merit the highest confidence and encomiums; an excellent artist in wax, himself a surgeon, mistook for real cloth the imitation cloth which is placed around each of the specimens, and did not discover his mistake for some time. Lastly. Such museums connect and link all pro- fessional men together—they enable them to under- stand each other, and to speak the same language; they even form an authentic record of progress both as regards diseases and their remedies.27 Models, £40. 9s. enteral Catalogue of t&e Muitma.

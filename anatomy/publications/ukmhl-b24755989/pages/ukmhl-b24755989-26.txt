20 models will be of the greatest utility in the study of toxicology. Tubercles, excrescences, tumours, ulcerations of various kinds, are all represented with an accuracy tculy fearful to persons unacquainted with the sciences of medicine, yet most valuable to those engaged in the study of this profession. The firmness of these models renders them to a certain extent unalterable, and, on this account, affords to them great superiority over preparations in wax; the facility with which the proofs may be multiplied allows also of their being offered in commerce at a reasonable price. These models will be of the greatest possible use for the purposes of instruction, and will become indispensable in uni- versities of medicine. M. Thibert has deserved highly from both science and art: he has effected for pathological anatomy what M. Anzou has for normal anatomy: he is worthy, therefore, of the same amount of encourage- ment. The committee, considering that this ingenious contrivance of M. Thibert is yet but in its infancy (July 1839), and that, if encouraged, it is capable of attaining to great development, awards to him a silver medal.

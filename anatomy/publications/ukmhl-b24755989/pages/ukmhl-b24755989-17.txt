11 tions were employed, then the aid of drawing and engraving was called into requisition; still later the plan of' preserving the anatomical specimens themselves in various ways was adopted, and lastly a mode of making imitations of them in wax has been pursued. It was a French surgeon, Guillaume Desnoues by name, a professor at Genoa, and a distinguished pupil of Malpighi, who first conceived the idea of reproducing, by means of wax, the forms and colours of the various parts of human anatomy. He availed himself of the assistance of a clever Sicilian modeller, Gaetano Guilo Zumbo, an abbot of Syracuse, to carry this project into execution. Our Academy of Sciences, which has always been ready to afford encouragement to inventions likely to be profitable to the medical sciences, praised this enterprise highly, and lost no time in bestowing its approbation on the inventor. This took place in the year 1701. But all these various processess for representing the characters of anatomical specimens had many imperfections and inconveniences. A written description is rarely faithful, and is generally borrowed from the doctrines of the day, and modified according to the systematic opinions of the author. Besides, on a subject of this kind, it is essential that nature herself should have been diligently studied, before much real success can

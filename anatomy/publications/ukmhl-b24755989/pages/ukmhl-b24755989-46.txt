10 serve in an economical mode, and not for exhibition, certain pathological structures for the sake of science and of after-examination; but this view is strictly compatible, and may co-exist with, the models of M. Thibert. In the preceding Report, I have, of course, said nothing of the application of M. Thibert's discovery to the representation of healthy and normal structure. As a teacher of anatomy, I hold in abhorrence all attempts by papier-mache machines, wax or plaster models, or by any similar contrivance, to represent the healthy human structure. They are calculated to favour indolence, to substitute the unreal for the real when the real can alone be useful. No sound anatomist, it is to be hoped, will ever sanction the use of such machines or models in the study of single descriptive anatomy*. My inspection of this great work has been as yet but hasty and imperfect; still, I have seen enough to cause in me deep regret that the method of Dr. Thibert had not been many years ago introduced into this country. A few concluding observations may, I hope, excite the interest of medical men whose distance from the capital prevents a personal inspec- tion ; for their accuracy I can only offer as a voucher * It is much to be regretted that the Honourable the East India Company sanctioned the use of papier-mache machines for the teaching normal anatomy ; I sincerely trust the Indian anatomists make no use of them.

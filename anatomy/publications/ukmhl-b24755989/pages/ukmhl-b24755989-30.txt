24 and then he applies his colours to the casts so ob- tained : in this way, the specimens are reproduced in the most exact manner possible, both in regard to form, relief, and colour. The Commission are - convinced that these models will undergo the test of time without any deterioration : any number of proofs may be obtained from each mould, and the price is considerably less than that of preparations in wax. The Commission have examined with care M. Thibert's collection : they have been struck with the fidelity with which the subjects are represented even in their most minute details j' such, for example, as diseases of the skin, those of the mucous membranes, especially the alterations undergone by the intestinal follicles in typhoid fever, a large number of affections of the brain, of the liver, the lungs, the genito-urinary organs, and the osseous system. They are con- vinced that there are hardly any alterations which disease can produce on our organs that may not be represented by this process of M. Thibert, and that, independently of the utility which might result from it for the individual instruction of medical men, the theoretical and practical teaching of patho- logy also ought to derive a great advantage from it. Wherefore, the Commission propose to the academy to grant to M. Thibert the recompense of 4,000 francs for his artificial preparations of pathological anatomy: Monthyon prize.

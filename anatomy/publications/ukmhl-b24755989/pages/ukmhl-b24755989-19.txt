13 men, are all taken with the most perfect accuracy, copied with the most rigorous exactness, and in fact are entirely reproduced. Owing to the great solidity of the " carton-pate" the models combine all the advantages of the varied, natural, lively, and durable characters of the best paintings. It is hardly necessary to observe that the artist can multiply the number of casts to any extent, all with the most perfect accuracy : such preparations combine also the recommendations of convenience of transport and reasonableness in cost. The preparations of M. Thibert have already ob- tained the sanction of the Royal Academy of Medi- cine, of the Royal Council of Public Instruction, and of the Faculty of Medicine. The Commission for the Monthyon Prize will, however, limit itself at present simply to recommending these preparations to the Academy. Before awarding to M. Thibert the prize of the generous testator, the Commission has judged it advisable to wait until these models shall have been applied to a greater number of dis- eases, to all cutaneous affections, for instance, and thus their utility become more practical; and until, more numerous, more varied, and more extended, they shall have rendered other services to the teaching both of special anatomy and of pathological anatomy.

41 my long experience in such matters, and the con- fidential situations I have held. 1st. Whilst I deprecate the employment of this or any other similar method, to represent normal struc- tures in human anatomy, or comparative anatomy, I feel disposed to recommend the representation by models in relief of all dangerous varieties of the great arteries; the history of Mr. John Shaw's un- fortunate case of lithotomy recals forcibly to my mind the importance of such preparation or models. I need not recal to the recollection of British surgeons what unjustifiable remarks were made on Mr. Shaw's operation, all which could easily have been avoided and prevented had the museum of the hospital possessed, as it ought to have, the varieties of the arteries properly preserved, or, what is much better, represented by the models of M. Thibert. 2d. The most instructive pathological appearances, occurring rarely and at extremely uncertain intervals, have been completely lost to science, owing to the difficulty, not to say impossibility, of duly preserving them by any of the recognized methods. I had in- tended to mention a few, but this seems unnecessary, since every practical man must have seen hundreds of such cases. Even when so prepared a valuable pre- paration, being single, is lost to the scientific world. I remember visiting Paris on one occasion almost solely for the purpose of examining the necrosed

iftmfeterfal <&vtin\ To the Prefect. The Royal Council of Public Instruction has ex- pressed its opinion that it would be useful for the purposes of instruction to place in the libraries of the faculties and provincial schools of medicine, the preparations of pathological anatomy, modelled and published by Dr. Felix Thibert. In accordance with this opinion, I feel it my duty to request that you, Sir, will invite the attention of the General Council of your department, or the municipal council of your locality, to these models published by Dr. Thibert: you will find me dis- posed to request of my colleague, the Minister of the Interior, to approve of the allowance of such sums as may be voted for the purchase of this col- lection, which would be deposited in the libraries or museums, and be placed at the disposal of the prac- titioners and pupils. Receive, Sir, the assurance of my distinguished regard. Villemain, Minister of Public Instruction. (A correct Copy.) NlSARD, Master of Requests, chief of the division.

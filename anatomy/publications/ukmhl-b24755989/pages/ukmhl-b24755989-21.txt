15 to represent the characters of various morbid lesions. A profound knowledge of the alterations which our organs undergo in the course of different diseases, is, without doubt, one of the most essential elements for the rational treatment of these same diseases : and for this reason the study of patho- logical anatomy has become one of the chief points in medical instruction. But instruction in this branch is singularly im- peded by the difficulty experienced in being able to present at the time when wanted, those specimens which form the subject of instruction,—specimens which can be but casually and transiently procured. This is not the case in the study of normal anatomy : here we have always the opportunity and facility of preparing muscles, vessels, and other parts which may be required to form the subject of de- monstration ; when, on the contrary, it is desired to describe the abnormal alterations of a tissue,—altera- tions perhaps very rare,«—it is not only essential to find a subject which presents these alterations, it is also necessary that the dissections should be made at a right time: it is necessary that death, that putrefaction (which is always rapid) should not have caused the disappearance of those essential characters on which it is of importance to fix the attention of those being instructed. These diffi- culties, which have long been felt, have led to the

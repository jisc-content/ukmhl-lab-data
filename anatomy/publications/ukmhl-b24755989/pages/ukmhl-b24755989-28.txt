22 which the preparations in wax did not offer) ; in the second place, it was necessary to make them so firm and solid that they might be made use of in the studies of a number of pupils, without any fear of their original form and characters being lost. It must be admitted that these two indications have never been properly fulfilled. M. Thibert, a doctor of medicine in Paris, has engaged in numerous researches into the best mode of preparing and imitating specimens of pathological anatomy. He has invented a substance by means of which he can represent in models, with the most perfect fidelity, all the characters of the various lesions of which our organs are susceptible. In the preparations of aneurism of the heart, cancer of the pylorus, typhoid enteritis, hepatization of the lung, &c, the committee were struck with the degree of accuracy and resemblance to nature which these models exhibited. These figures represent the exact volume, prominences, and colours of nature : with these advantages they combine another, which has never yet been offered by any other process, viz. the property of being uninjured by exposure to the action of moisture, of rain, or even of the sun. The committee have thought fit to award again to M. Thibert the silver medal which he obtained last year at the General Exposition of the Products of Industry.

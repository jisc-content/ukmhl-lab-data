Numerous collections of diseased organs existed no doubt prior to Dr. Baillie's time; he first systematized them, and was the founder of sys- tematic pathology and pathological anatomy. More lately, Baron Dupuytren founded a similar museum in Paris, which bears his name. I shall speak presently of the attempts and efforts made in this country, and throughout civilized Europe, to extend these ideas,â€”I mean to form extensive and useful pathological museums : all these efforts have failed, or must inevitably do so, from the nature of the objects attempted to be preserved. Their support has been, with few exceptions, disastrous to their founders, causing them enormous pecuniary losses; those who have escaped such losses by the sale of their collections at a fortunate moment to two public bodies, were the second Dr. Monro and Sir Charles Bell; all the others, as I shall afterwards shew, suffered extremely heavy losses. Ten thousand pounds, being not a third of what it cost the founder, were paid, though with great reluctance, by the British Government, to Mr. John Hunter's family, for his museum, which, as a work of genius, is perhaps without a parallel in the world. This brief outline will explain to those not familiar

33 But previous to the discovery and avowal of this great failure, the medical faculty generally, collec- tively and individually, had made the greatest efforts imaginable to render the existing museums useful. To the preparations preserved in alcoholic liquids, and prepared by cleaning, drying, and varnishing, they added, in some instances, models or representa- tions in wax, hoping thereby to exhibit the specimen with its original colours and form; and finally, a last effort was made, to make up for the obvious failure in the natural preparations preserved in alcohol or dried and varnished, by the most costly drawings in oil and water colours, subsequently engraved or lithographed by the first artists. Of these two methods of supplying the deficiencies in the original mode of setting up morbid specimens in spirituous liquors, I shall here say a few words. 1. Representations of disease and of diseased struc- tures by drawings, whether in oil or otherwise, leave on the mind only the vaguest recollections. They have in consequence altogether failed. Students will scarcely look at them. Junior medical men feel that they afford them little or no solid information. One the Royal Colleges of Surgeons or Physicians, paying to these cor- porate bodies excessive and exorbitant fees; this clause, which no doubt will and ought to meet with the strongest opposition from most medical men, has been inserted into the amended Bill mainly for the providing a fund to support museums which are of no benefit whatever to the public or to the profession.

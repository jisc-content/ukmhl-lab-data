35 opinion is, that they are not of the smallest value. But these circumstances were absolutely trifling compared with the efforts of others and of myself at this particular time. Thousands of pounds were expended in attempting to represent faithfully patho- logical appearances during life, and morbid altera- tions of the human organs, in such a way as to be useful to science. To the student, to the teacher, to the practitioner, the result was uniformly a com- plete and entire failure.* 2. Baffled in this attempt, modelling in wax, as the nearest approach to nature, was also attempted. This promised to be more successful; and it cannot be denied that some extremely beautiful models in relief have been formed in wax. What, then, are the * A remarkable instance of the inadequacy of drawings to convey any just idea of pathological appearances, occurred, a few years ago, under my own observation. A farm-servant, labouring under the very worst form of acute glanders, or button-farcy, was brought into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The case was treated as one of ery- sipelas of the scalp and face, none of the attending medical men, though quite familiar with drawings of the formidable disease in ques- tion, having been skilful enough to recognize it during life, nor after death either, until their attention was called to the circumstance some ten or twelve days afterwards by the sheriff of the county, who had instituted an inquiry into the circumstances of the case. A single specimen from Dr. Thibert's museum, placed in the museum of the hospital, would at least have prevented the dangerous error committed in the diagnosis. During the post-mortem examination the attending physicians refused to listen to an observation I made, namely, that the appearances were not those of erysipelas, but were wholly new to me.

The appearances which he has once witnessed in them he can see a second, a third, or even a twentieth time; and it is thus that the knowledge of the ana- tomy of healthy organs has been enabled to progress with such rapid strides as to have attained its present state of perfection. In pathological anatomy, on the contrary, an opportunity for observation once lost is perhaps never regained : and nothing is more evanescent than the objects presented to the eye of an observer in this department of science. If he does not speedily fix, by some means, the fleeting character of such objects, so that he may at any

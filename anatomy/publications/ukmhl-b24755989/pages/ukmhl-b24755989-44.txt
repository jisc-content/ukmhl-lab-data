38 disappeared : the smaller ones merit no notice. As nature is everywhere the same, the Museum Dupuy- tren must, sooner or later, share the same fate. That there are morbid structures which anatomists may continue still to preserve, after the usual mode, T will not deny. Every practical man can readily recollect and select such structures; but by far the greater number of diseased structures, and nearly all pathology, must be represented in a totally different manner to what has been done hitherto. To Dr. F. Thibert we owe the discovery of a substitute at once efficient, economical, and practical. But to under- stand the nature of the museum of models in relief brought into this country by Dr. Thibert, it is ne- cessary that it be seen and inspected; then alone can its full value and importance be distinctly under- stood. By its means, as has been already so ably explained by M. Cruveilhier and others, in their reports to the Institute, and to the Academy of Me- dicine, all pathological appearances, and all morbid structures, can be represented as in life, or nearly so, and at a comparatively trifling cost. The material used is hard, unalterable by climate, and the colours indelible. They can be multiplied from the moulds to any extent, and thus diffused through the hos- pitals of the kingdom, transmitted to the colonies, placed in all the great military and naval, and county hospitals, in the colleges and medical academies; extend, in short, where science or humanity demands

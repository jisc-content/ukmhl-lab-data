12 possibly attend the perusal of descriptions given in books. Representations by drawing and engraving have this great objection, that they are apt to bear upon them the expression of the artists' ideas or precon- ceived notions. Moreover, there is a kind of vague- ness and indecision attached to them : for, on the one hand, we perhaps observe scarcely any thing but plain surfaces, while on the other hand the colours employed to represent the shades are seldom exactly those of the original specimens. With regard to those specimens preserved ana- tomically, it must be observed that they afford but very mediocre assistance to study. Their colour disappears; they become altered in form; the spe- cimens cannot be multiplied, and it is as difficult to touch as to obtain a good view of them. Models in wax also too often bear upon them the impress of the artists' imagination. To be well executed these preparations require considerable time: they are apt to change rapidly in form and colour ; great care is also requisite in handling them, and removing them from one place to another. All these are serious objections to this mode of repre- senting the characters of objects. The method adopted by M. Thibert remedies almost all these defects. In a few moments, the form, the various prominences and depressions, the colour and different shades of the anatomical speci-

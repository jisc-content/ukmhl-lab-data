34 gentleman alone expended, it is said, fully 20O0Z. on drawings in water-colours of every possible form of disease, and every variety of pathological derange- ment of structure. Here was an experiment on a great scale, and the result has been a total failure: the practical man knows that he can derive no solid benefit from the inspection of such drawings; the student feels that they form but a miserable substi- tute for the reality. No one will again, I trust, be foolish enough to repeat such an effort. In my younger days (1816) I paid to Mr. Charpentier, of Portsmouth, four guineas for a single coloured drawing of a necrosed bone, which drawing neither teaches nor instructs. If the preparation itself exist it may now be worth half a crown : the drawing is of no value what- ever. Still anxious to record the leading patholo- gical facts as they occurred, I employed, in 1821, a French artist to make for me three coloured drawings of a very valuable preparation of necrosed collar- bone (perhaps quite unique), presented originally, nearly a century ago, by D'Angerville to the Academy of Medicine, and transferred by them to the museums of the faculty. This preparation I had seen very roughly handled by the Professor of Surgery at a com- mon demonstration to a class of Parisian students; and dreading lest in process of time it might disappear, or be otherwise injured, I caused a French artist to make for me three coloured drawings. These draw- ings cost me nearly 100 francs, and my present

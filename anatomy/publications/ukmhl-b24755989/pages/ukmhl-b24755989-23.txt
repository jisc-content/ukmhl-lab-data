17 take an interest in examining into all their details ; moreover, their high price will always render them too scarce to allow of being habitually made use of in a course of lectures, or even for particular study. M. Thibert has succeeded in doing away with these several inconveniences. The models of pathological anatomy which he presents to the society are cast in moulds, prepared with the greatest possible care, from nature : the material of which they are made is a firm and solid composition: the colours are excellent, and apparently unalterable by time. This method, which implies, on the part of the inventor, a perfect knowledge of anatomy, together with great skill as a designer, painter, and modelist, may now be executed by common workmen, who can be readily instructed in the process. It has already acquired sufficient importance to lead to the em- ployment of from twelve to fifteen workmen daity. We will not speak of the merit of these models in a medical point of view, for their exactness, as well as their scientific utility, have been duly appreciated 1>\ very competent judges in this branch of science. MM. Anclral, Breschet, and Cruveilhier, who, in a report to the Academy of Medicine, October 22nd, 1839, observe, "Our task will be an easy one, both from the nature of the subject, which allows of each member of the Academy appreciating at a glance the importance of this mode of representing morbid lesions, and also from the merit of these models,

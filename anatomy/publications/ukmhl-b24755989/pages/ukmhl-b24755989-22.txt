hi suggestion of different modes of preserving these specimens, in order to supply the insufficiency of oral descriptions. These methods chiefly consist in the employment of alcohol, or solutions of substances which possess the power of preventing putrefaction : but it is enough to cast a glance over a collection of objects of this kind, to appreciate all the imperfections of this mode of preservation, by which not merely the forms of parts are altered, but also their colours, which are such important features in the subject now occupying our attention. It is in vain that we expect from an engraving, even a coloured engraving, a faithful representation of pathological specimens ; the necessity of repre- senting all the shaded parts, and the contours of the objects, by means of dark colours, in order to give them suitable relief, modifies very sensibly the tint peculiar to each part, and this is highly prejudicial to their study. What description, what drawing could replace this facsimile, which you have before your eyes, of the alterations produced by glanders in man ? It is true that we find in many well supplied museums, preparations in wax, which leave nothing to be desired as regards the faithful representation of nature ; but these objects (which are always very expensive) do not usually possess sufficient firmness to admit of their being intrusted to those who would

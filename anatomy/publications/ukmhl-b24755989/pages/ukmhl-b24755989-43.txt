By immersion in spirituous liquors nearly every morbid structure is destroyed; all colour disappears; the very forms cannot in consequence be made out; the glass and its contained fluid magnify the structures grotesquely; the structure itself cannot be handled; the expense of getting up, restoring, preserving, are positively endless and ruinous. Lastly, when so prepared, the preparation is seldom or ever of any use: ultimately these preparations go down altogether. Such has been the fate of all the private collections I have known: magnificent efforts of public-spirited men, struggling with difficulties not to be overcome. Such has been the fate of the Brookes' collectionâ€”of those formed by Messrs. Heaviside, Langstaff, John Lizars, Macintosh, and myself.

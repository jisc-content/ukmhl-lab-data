9 Your Commission is also of opinion that it is im- possible to encourage too highly, a method which so faithfully represents the character of morbid lesions. Moreover, it believes that it would be right to request M. Thibert to apply his admirable talents not merely to the reproduction of the general forms of morbid lesions, but also to the study of the anatomy of texture of diseased organs.

These models cannot be multiplied excepting in the same expensive way, and they must not be handled : they must be preserved under glass with the greatest care. And lastly, their colours alter, in spite of every effort. Thus models in wax can never form a useful museum, nor replace effec- tually the present pathological preparations. They cannot be multiplied at a trifling expense, like those of Dr. Thibert: they cannot, like his, be extended to every county hospital in the kingdom, and every naval and military hospital of our colonies: they cannot be made to benefit humanity to the same extent. Now this relief to suffering humanity is avowedly the great object of all medical science and art, and on this I with confidence base my opinion that the discovery of Dr. Thibert merits the attention and the support of all Governments.

8 year to the scientific congress in Germany, many clever anatomists there, to whom he submitted his artificial preparations, imagined at first that they were real organs and parts preserved, and they begged he would acquaint them with the method he had adopted for their preservation. It is understood that this method of so very faithfully representing morbid lesions has created considerable sensation in Germany, and that many of the Professors in the Universities of that country are about to request that their go- vernment should purchase the collection of models published by M. Thibert. Already, acting in accordance with the advice of the Royal Council of Public Instruction, and fore- seeing to a certain extent the decision of the Academy, has the minister set the example, and requested the prefects of departments to invite the attention of general and local councils to the models of M.Thibert, which, deposited in the libraries of the faculties and secondary schools, would be placed at the disposal of practitioners and pupils. Your Commission is of opinion that the Academy ought to respond in the most favourable manner to the letter in which the Minister requests its opinion respecting these models of M. Thibert, and to state that it would be highly advantageous for the purposes of instruction that each Faculty and each secondary school of medicine should possess the collection.

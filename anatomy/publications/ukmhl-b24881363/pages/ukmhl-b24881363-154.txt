134 THE POPES AND SCIENCE teenth century a work on science, which was undertaken at the command of the Pope of his time, to show him the character of the teaching of science at the Univer- sity of Oxford. Roger Bacon defined the limits of chemistry very accurately and showed that he under- stood exactly what the subject and methods of investi- gation must be, in order that advance should be made in it. Of chemistry he speaks in his “ Opus Tertium ” in the following words: “There is a science which treats of the generation of things from their elements and of all inanimate things, as of the elements and liquids, simple and compound, common stones, gems and marble, gold and other metals, sulphur, salts, pigments, lapis lazuli, minium and other colors, oils, bitumen, and infinite more of which we find nothing in the books of Aristotle ; nor are the natural philosophers nor any of the Latins acquainted with these things.” The thirteenth century saw the rise of a number of great physical scientists, who made observations that anticipated much more of our modern views on scientific problems than is usually thought. One of the greatest of the chemists of the thirteenth century was Albert the Great, or Albertus Magnus, as he is more familiarly called, who taught for many years at the University of Paris. He was a theologian as well as a physician and a scientist. His works have been published in twenty- one folio volumes, which will give some idea of the im- mense industry of the man. Those relating to chemistry are as follows : Concerning Metals and Minerals ; Con- cerning Alchemy; A Treatise on the Secrets of Chem- istry • A Brief Compend on the Origin of the Metals ; A Concordance, that is, a Collection, of Observations from Many Sources, with Regard to the Philosopher s

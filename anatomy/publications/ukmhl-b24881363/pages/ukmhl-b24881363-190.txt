170 THE POPES AND SCIENCE President White insists over and over again that what- ever surgery there was, and especially whatever progress was made in surgery, was due to the Arabs, or at least to Arabian initiative. Gurlt, in his History of Surgery,1 which we have referred to elsewhere, is very far from sharing this view. I need scarcely say that Gurlt is one of our best authorities in the history of surgery. In his sketch of Roger, the first of the great Italian surgeons of the thirteenth century who came after the foundation of the universities, Gurlt says that, “though Arabian writings on surgery had been brought over to Italy by Constantine Africanus a hundred years before Roger’s time, those exercised no influence over Italian surgery in the next century, and there is not a trace of the surgical knowledge of the Arabs to be found in Roger’s work.” His writing depends almost entirely upon the surgical traditions of his time, the experience of his teachers and colleagues, to whom in two places he has given due credit, and on the Greek writers. There are no traces of Arabisms to be found in Roger’s writing, while they are full of Grecisms. Roger represents the first important writer on surgery in modern times, and his works have been printed several times because of their value as original documents. It is wonderfully amusing to anyone who knows Gurlt’s History of Surgery,2 that the distinguished old professor of the University of Berlin, looked up to as so well in- formed as to the history of the branch of medical science to which he had devoted a long life, should have wasted some three hundred pages of his first volume on the His- 1 Geechichte der Chirursrie und ihrer Ausubuns.

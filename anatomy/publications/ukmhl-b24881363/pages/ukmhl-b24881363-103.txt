83 ANATOMY TO THE RENAISSANCE of their own great medical school in Rome, in which anatomy was to be culti vated above all the other sciences, so that there would be no reason to expect from other sources of historical knowledge any interruption of Berengar’s work, and it did not come. A fifth great student of anatomy during the fifteenth century was Benivieni, who has been neglected in the ordinary histories of anatomy because his work con- cerned itself almost exclusively with pathological, not with normal anatomy. In our increasing interest in pathology during the nineteenth century, he has very properly come in for his due share of attention.

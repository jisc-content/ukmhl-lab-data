236 THE POPES AND SCIENCE of Harvey’s in the matter of the discovery of the circu- lation of the blood has always made the Italians exag- gerate his position in medical history, while it has undoubtedly made English writers of medical history diminish the importance of his work. Historians of science consider him worthy to be called the greatest living scientist of his time-the end of the sixteenth century. He was not only a scientific physician, but he was an authority in all the sciences related to med- icine, and indeed had profound interests in every branch of physical science. His contemporaries looked up to him as a leader in scientific thought. To anyone who examines the question of the discovery of the circulation of the blood with freedom from bias, there can be no doubt but that the honor for this discovery has been unduly taken away from Cassalpinus in English-speaking countries, to be conferred solely on Harvey. Not that there is any wish to lessen the value of Harvey’s magnificent original woi k, nor make little of his wonderful powers of observation, nor of the marvelous experimental and logical method by which he followed out his thoughts to theii legitimate conclusion, but that I would insist on giving honor where honor is due, though most writers in English refuse to give Caesalpinus’s claims a proper share of attention. The Italians have always declared that Csesalpinus was the real discoverer of the circulation, and there is no doubt that his career occurs just at that point in the evolution of the medical sciences, and especially anatomy and physiology in Italy, where this discovery would naturally come. Lest it should be thought, however, that my interest in the Popes and the Papal Medical School has led me to exaggerate the claims of Cass-

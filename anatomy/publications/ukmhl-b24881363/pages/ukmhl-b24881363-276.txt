THE POPES AND SCIENCE 256 ceased to be a hospital and became a prison, while Christ’s Hospital, though retaining its name, became a school. With some of these institutions the name of Edward VI. has become associated, but, as pointed out by Gairdner, the English historical writer, without any due warrant. Gairdner says in his History of the Eng- lish Church in the Sixteenth Century, “Edward has left a name in connection with charities and education which critical scholars find to be little justified by fact.” The supposed foundation of St. Thomas’s Hospital, as he points out, was only the re-establishment of this insti- tution, “and even when it was granted by Edward to the citizens of London, it was not without their paying for it. ’ ’ Many institutions, charitable and educational, had been destroyed by Henry VIII., and the crying need for them became so great under Edward’s reign that the government was compelled to provide for their re- establishment. It is no wonder, with all this activity of the hospital foundation movement, that Virchow should have been unstinted in his praise of the Pontiff and of the Church responsible for the great charity. He said : “ It may be recognized and admitted that it was reserved for the Roman Catholic Church, and above all for Innocent III., not only to open the bourse of Christian charity and mercy in all its fulness, but also to guide the life-giving stream into every branch of human life in an ordered manner. For this reason alone the interest in this man and in this time will never die out.” Even this was not all that he felt bound to say, and in his admiration he quite forgot the constant opposition he manifested toward the Papacy on all other occasions. This happened to be the one feature of Papal influence

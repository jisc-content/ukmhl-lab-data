103 THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY raphers tells that he dissected small animals, rats and mice, and occasionally even dogs and cats, in his eager- ness to learn the details of anatomy for himself and at first hand. After graduating at Louvain in philosophy and philol- ogy, Vesalius went to Paris to study medicine. At this time at Paris, Sylvius, after whom one of the most im- portant fissures of the brain, the sylvian, is named, was not only teaching anatomy in a very interesting way, but was also providing opportunities for original research in anatomy in connection with his own investigations. The interest that his teaching excited may be gathered from the fact that over 400 students were in attendance at his lectures. Besides Sylvius, Gunther of Andernach in Switzerland was also teaching in Paris, and with both of these distinguished professors Vesalius became inti- mately associated. His deep interest in the subject of anatomy would of itself be quite sufficient to attract the attention of professors, but he had besides the added advantage of being known as the descendant of a family which had occupied prominent posts as medical attend- ants to the greatest ruling family of Europe. It was at Paris, then, that Vesalius first was able to devote himself with the intense ardor of his character to the study of anatomy. Nothing less than original research at first hand would satisfy his ardent desire for information and his thirst for accurate knowledge. His practical temper of mind was demonstrated by a revolu- tion that he worked in the method of doing dissections at the time. The dissections in Paris used to be per- formed by the barber-surgeons, as a rule rather ignorant men, who knew little of their work beyond the barest outline of the technics of dissection.

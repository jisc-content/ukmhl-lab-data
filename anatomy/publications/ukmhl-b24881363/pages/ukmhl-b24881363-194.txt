174 THE POPES AND SCIENCE among the great Italian physicians of the latter half of the thirteenth century. Now, these great Italians were as distinguished in surgery as in medicine, and William was one of the protestants of the period against the di- vision of surgery from inner medicine—a division which he regarded as a separation of medicine from intimate touch with nature. Like Lanfranc and the other great surgeons of the Italian tradition, and unlike Franco and Pare, he had the advantage of the liberal university edu- cation of Italy; but, like Pare and Wurtz, he had large practical experience in hospital and in the battlefield. He practiced first at Bologna, afterwards in Verona. William fully recognized that surgery cannot be learned from books only. His surgery contains many case his- tories, for he rightly opined that good notes of cases are the soundest foundation of good practice; and in this opinion and method Lanfranc followed him. William discovered that dropsy may be due to a “durities renum he substituted the knife for the Arabist abuse of the cautery ; he investigated the causes of the failure of healing by first intention ; he described the danger of wounds of the neck ; he sutured divided nerves ; he for- warded the diagnosis of suppurative disease of the hip ; and he referred chancre and phagedasna to “their proper causes.” Anyone who knows the history of surgery and of sup- posed modern progress in medicine will recognize at once that many of these ideas of Salicet are anticipations of discoveries supposed to have been made in the nine- teenth century. The connection between dropsy and hardening of the kidneys is a typical example of this. The fact that William should have insisted that surgery cannot be learned from books is an open contradiction

205 PAPAL PHYSICIANS It seems not unlikely, and indeed there are some tradi- tions to that effect, that in cases of severe illnesses of the Popes, important members of the medical faculty were sometimes summoned from the South of Italy to Rome. The relations of the Popes to the neighboring abbey of Monte Cassino might, as we have said, suggest this. We have, however, very few details in this matter.

In this he anticipated another great English physician

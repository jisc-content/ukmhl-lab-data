338 THE POPES AND SCIENCE they undoubtedly serve in turn to awaken a greater thirst for the information which they purvey. The other two encyclopedists of the time are Thomas Cantipratano and Bartholomaeus Anglicus, the Englishman. Thomas of Cantimprato’s work was probably published about 1260. Von Toply, in his Studies in Anatomy in the Middle Ages, has the most readily available informa- tion with regard to Thomas’s work.1 The work of most interest to us is the De Natura Rerum, a single large volume in twenty books. It required some fifteen years of work, and for some fifteen years before he began his work on it Thomas had been writing various historical and biographical works. Thomas’s encyclopedic volume contains one book with regard to anatomy, one with regard to human monsters, and books with regard to quadrupeds, birds, marine monsters, fishes, serpents, worms, ordinary trees, aromatic and medicinal plants and the virtues of herbs, and of curative waters of various kinds. Then there are books on precious stones and their cutting, on the seven regions and the humors of the air, on the earth and the seven planets, and on the four elements and the Heavens and eclipses of the sun and moon. When such a work was published for general reading, it is easy to understand that no phase of in- formation with regard to nature failed to be of interest to readers of the thirteenth century. Much that is ab- surd is contained in the book. But when we compare it with books written in the early part of the eighteenth century, we are apt to wonder rather at how little ad- vance had taken place in the four centuries of interval, than at the ignorance of the medieval writer. 1 Studien zur Geschichte der Anatomie im Mittelalter von Robert Ritter von Toply, Leipzig und Wien.

A very interesting commentary on the expressions of Professor White with regard to Vesalius is to be found in a paragraph of Von Toply’s article on the History of Anatomy in the second volume of Puschmann’s History of Medicine, already quoted. “Out of the fruitful soil so well cultivated in the two preceding centuries, there developed at the beginning of the sixteenth century the Renaissance of anatomy, with all the great and also with all the unpleasant features which belong to the impor- tant works of art of that period.

48 THE POPES AND SCIENCE years after Mondino made the public demonstrations in dissection that are the subject of discussion. It will be conceded by everyone that such prosecutions for body- snatching are not likely to occur when only one or two graves are violated a year, but are usually the result of a series of such outrages, which arouse the community against them. We prefer to give this bit of history once more in the words of Professor Pilcher, who has argued this whole case for the frequency of dissection within twenty years after the bull that is supposed to have for- bidden it better than anyone else, and whose knowledge of Mondino and his times is such as to make him an au- thority on the subject. He has no interest in them, as I have said, either for or against the Popes. His only idea is to bring out the real meaning of whatever data we possess for the history of anatomy and dissection at this time. â€œAn instructive and interesting side-light on the con- ditions attending the study of practical anatomy in the days of Mondino may be found in a record, still extant, of a legal procedure which occurred in Bologna in the year 1319, four years after Mondino had begun his pub- lic demonstrations and at a time when Otto and Aless- andra were doubtless enthusiastically working with him. According to the record, four students, three from Milan and one from Piacenza, were accused of having gone at night time to the cemetery of the church of San Bar- nada, outside the San Felice gate, and to have sacrileg- iously violated the grave in which was buried the body of a certain Pasino who had been hung on the gallows near the Ponte di Reno.

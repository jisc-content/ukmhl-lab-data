126 THE POPES AND SCIENCE it public money for believing eyes, and it is only in this “ way that they deceive the ignorant populace as to the ‘ ‘ alchemic fire of their furnace. Wishing to banish such ‘‘practices for all time, we have determined by this “ formal edict that whoever shall make gold or silver of ‘ ‘ this kind or shall order it made, provided the attempt ‘‘actually follows, or whoever shall knowingly assist ‘‘those engaged (actually) in such a process, or who- ‘‘ ever shall knowingly make use of such gold or silver “ either by selling it or giving it for debt, shall be com- ‘ ‘ pelled as a penalty to pay into the public treasury, to ‘ ‘ be used for the poor, as much by weight of genuine gold and silver as there may be of alchemic metal, provided it be proved lawfully that they have been guilty in any of the aforesaid ways; for those who “ persist in making alchemic gold, or, as has been said, ‘ ‘ in using it knowingly, let them be branded with the ‘ ‘ mark of perpetual infamy.

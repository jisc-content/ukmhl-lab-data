286 THE POPES AND SCIENCE or taught the world the application of the experimental method in science after Gilbert’s time is to talk nonsense. Yet it was of this great scientific observer that Lord Bacon, carried away by ill-feeling and jealousy of a con- temporary, went so far as to say in his De Augmentis Scientiarum, that Gilbert “had attempted to found a general system upon the magnet, and endeavored to build a ship out of materials not sufficient to make the rowing-pins of a boat.” When Bacon refused to accept Copernicus’s teachings, he did not commit a greater er- ror, nor do a greater wrong to mankind, than when he * made little of Gilbert of Colchester’s work. Poggendorf called Gilbert the “Galileo of Magnetism ” and Priestley hailed him as the “founder of modern electricity.” When Gilbert did the work on which these titles are founded, however, he was only following out the meth- ods which had been introduced into England long before, and which had been exemplified so thoroughly all during the life of Friar Bacon, and of Friar Bacon’s great teacher, Albertus Magnus. One would expect that at least in science credit would be given properly, and that the false notions introduced by litterateurs and histori- ans of politics should not be allowed to dominate the situation. The position popularly assigned to Bacon in the his- tory of science is indeed one of those history lies, as the Germans so bluntly but frankly call them, which, though very generally accepted, is entirely due to a lack of knowledge of the state of education and of the progress of scientific investigation long before his time. The reason for this ignorance is the unfortunate tradition which has been so long fostered in educational circles,

119 THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY than good, and that until they were gotten rid of no im- provement in ecclesiastical matters could be looked for. When Paracelsus came to die he left his money mainly to the Shrine of the Blessed Virgin in his native town of Einsiedeln and for masses for his soul. Since their time most of the distinguished medical scientists have been quite as faithful in their Catholicity as these two great medical colleagues of the Renaissance period. While medicine is supposed to be unorthodox in its ten- dencies, the really great thinkers in medicine, the men to whose names important discoveries in the science were attached, were not only faithful believers in the doctrines of Christianity, but were much more often than has been thought even devout Catholics. At the death of Vesalius the Golden Age of the devel- opment of anatomy was not at its close, but was just beginning. Eustachius, Csesalpinus, Harvey and Mal- pighi were during the course of the next century to make anatomy a science in the strict sense of that word. After Vesalius’s time the history of anatomy in Italy centers around the Papal Medical School to a great ex- tent. During Vesalius’s lifetime his greatest rival be- came the professor of anatomy there. The anatomical school of Bologna, in connection with that city, became an important focus of anatomical investigation. At this time Bologna was a Papal city. It was in the dominions of the Popes, then, as we shall see, that anatomy was carried on with the most success and with the most ardor. Far from there being any opposition to the de- velopment of the science, every encouragement was given to it, and it was the patronage of the Popes and of the higher ecclesiastics that to a great degree made possible the glorious evolution of the science during the next century.

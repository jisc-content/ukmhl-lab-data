THE POPES AND SCIENCE 84 ing from burns near the elbow, which place him among the most ingenious and original of surgical thinkers. It is his interest in dissection that commends him to us here. He must have done a very great number of autopsies. His interest in the causes of disease was so great that he seems to have taken every possible opportunity to search out changes in organs which would account for symptoms that he had observed. His place in anatomy and the history of pathology has not been properly ap- preciated in this matter, and Professor Allbutt claims for him the title of Father of Pathology, rather than for those to whom it has been given, and demands for his work done in Florence during the second half of the fif- teenth century the credit of laying the real foundation- stones of the great science of pathological anatomy. Unfortunately, he died comparatively young and with- out having had time properly to publish his own contribu- tions to medical science. Professor Allbutt says “The little book De abditis causis morborum (brief title), was not published in any form by Antony Beni- vieni himself, but posthumously by his brother Jerome, who found these precious notes in Antony’s desk after his death, and with the hearty cooperation of a friend competent in the subject, published them in 1506 in a form which no doubt justly merits our admiration. Benivieni’s chief fame for us is far more than all this ; it is that he was the founder of pathological anat- omy. So far as I know, he was the first to make the custom and to declare the need of necropsy to reveal what he called not exactly “the secret causes,” but the hidden causes of diseases. Before Yesalius, before Eustachius, he opened the bodies of the dead as deliber-

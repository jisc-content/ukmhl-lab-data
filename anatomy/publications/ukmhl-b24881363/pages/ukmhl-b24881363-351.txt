331 CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE crafts and arts had risen to a degree of perfection which we can hardly boast of having superseded in many di- rections, if the inventive skill of the worker and the superior finish of his work be appreciated higher than rapidity of fabrication. The navies of the free cities furrowed in all directions the Northern Seas and the Southern Mediterranean ; one effort more and they would cross the oceans. Over large tracts of land, well-being had taken the place of misery; learning had grown and spread; the methods of science had been elaborated; the basis of natural philosophy had been laid down ; and the way had been paved for all the mechanical inven- tions of which our own times are so proud. The period for which Prince Kropotkin is thus enthu- siastic in the matter of applied science, is all before the date usually given as the beginning of the Renaissanceâ€” the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The three centuries and a half from the beginning of the eleventh century represent just the time of the rise of scholasticism and the beginning of its decline. Few periods of history are so maligned as regards their intellectual feebleness, and in nothing is that quality supposed to be more marked than in applied science ; yet here is what a special stu- dent of the time says of this very period in this par- ticular department. Kropotkin has shown just what were the limitations of scientific progress in the Middle Ages while empha- sizing how much these wonderful generations accom- plished. In this I am inclined to the opinion that he does not allow as much to the Middle Ages as he should. I have been able to point out, I think, in this chapter many evidences of important principles in science that were fully reached during the Middle Ages. Because of

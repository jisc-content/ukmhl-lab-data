THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY 99 in which, as an introduction to what he has to say about Galen, he suras up the history of anatomy from the return of the Popes from Avignon to Rome, which took place just about the beginning of the last quarter of the four- teenth century, down to the time of Vesalius. This ex- presses so well what I have been trying to say with regard to the gradual development that led up to the Golden Age of Anatomy and to Vesalius’s work, that I quote it. “Meanwhile, however, the return of the Popes to Rome (1374) and the displacement of the Albucasis and Avicenna by the Greek texts renewed the shriveling body of medicine, and with the help of anatomy, Italian medicine awoke again ; though until the days of Vesa- lius and Harvey the renascence came rather from men of letters than of medicine. The Arabs and Paris said : “ Why dissect if you trust Galen ? But the Italian phy- sicians insisted on verification; and therefore back to Italy again the earnest and clear-sighted students flocked from all regions. Vesalius was a young man when he professed in Padua, yet, young or venerable, where but in Italy would he have won, I would not say renown, but even sufferance! If normal anatomy was not directly a reformer of medicine, by way of anatomy came morbid anatomy, as conceived by the genius of Benivieni, of Morgagni, and of Valsalva; the galenical or humoral doctrine of pathology was sapped, and soaring in excel- sis for the essence of disease gave place to grubbing for its roots.” . ^ s^etch of Vesalius’s career will give the best pos- sible idea of the influences at work in science during this Golden Age of anatomical discovery, and will at the same time serve to show better than anything else, how

230 THE POPES AND SCIENCE hesitate to proclaim him one of the greatest men of his time. Daunou, one of the continuators of the Benedic- tines’ literary history of France,1 says that this Peter of Spain was one of the most notable persons in Europe in his generation. Pope John XXI., before his accession to the Papacy, had certainly accomplished remarkable work in medicine, and of a kind that makes his writings of great interest even at the present day. There is scarcely an important pathological condition of the eye which does not receive some consideration in this little book, and it is a constant source of surprise in reading it to find, with their limited knowledge and lack of instruments, what good diagnos- ticians the ophthalmologists of the thirteenth century were. Cataract is described, for instance, under the name of “water that descends into the eye,” and a distinction is made between cataract from internal and external causes. Hardening of the eye is mentioned and is declared to be very serious in its effects. There seems no doubt that this was glaucoma. Conditions of the lids, particularly, were differentiated and treated by rational measures, some of them quite modem in sub- stance. A curious anticipation of modern therapeu- tics is the frequent recommendation of extracts of the livers of various fishes for external and internal use, that is a reminder of the present employment of cod- liver oil. The book is acknowledged to be a classic in medicine. The fact that its author should have become Pope later, is the best proof that instead of opposition there was the greatest sympathy between medicine and ecclesiasticism in his time.

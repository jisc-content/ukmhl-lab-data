THE POPES AND SCIENCE 70 master William, and he did so also in anatomy. Some of the details of his work will be found in our chapter on Surgery in the Middle Ages. He could not have been able to give the detailed instructions that he has for the treatment of every portion of the body only that he knew them by actual contact in the cadaver as well as the pa- tient. His outlook upon scientific medicine and surgery would satisfy even the most exacting of modern experi- mental scientists. The famous aphorism of his runs as follows : ‘ ‘ Every science which depends on operation is greatly strengthened by experience. ’ ’ More than any- thing else, however, surgery owes to Lanfranc the dis- tinct advantage that he carried into the West as far as Paris, the methods which had come into existence in Italy, and were ever after to prove a precious heritage in the great French University. As Salicet’s work was carried on by Lanfranc, at least as well was Lanfranc’s work further advanced by his pupil and successor in the chair of surgery, Henri de Mondeville. This subject of surgical development will be treated in the chapter on Surgery in the Middle Ages. Here it is introduced only to emphasize the opportunity there must have been for anatomical study through dissection in the thirteenth century, or these men would not have made the marvel- ous progress they actually accomplished in this depart- ment. With regard to Mondino, Taddeo’s successor at Bo- logna, enough has been said already in the preceding chapter. About this time, however, very definite evi- dence begins to accumulate of the frequent practice of dissection. Roth, whose life of Vesalius is a standard work in the history of anatomy, has summed up most of what we know with regard to dissections in the early

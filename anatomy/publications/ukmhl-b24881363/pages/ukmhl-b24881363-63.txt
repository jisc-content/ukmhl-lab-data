SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 43 sections, and that it was a common practice for him to make anatomical preparations in many different ways, under many different circumstances and for many dif- ferent purposes. The second quotation shows, in fact, that Mondino had the custom sometimes of boiling his bodies before dis- secting them when he wished to demonstrate special features, and he promises to make such an anatomy for his students at another time. If the bull of Pope Boni- face VIII. was misinterpreted in any way to prohibit dissection, this would surely be the practice supposed to fall under its provisions. Here we find Mondino, less than twenty years after the promulgation of the bull, writing about this very practice, however, and calmly suggesting that he follows it as a routine, in a book that was published without let or hindrance from the eccles- iastical authorities, and that became for the next two centuries the most used book in the teaching of anatomy in educational institutions that were directly under ec- clesiastical authorities. If the bull was misinterpreted so as to forbid dissection, as has been said, surely this flagrant violation of it would not have been permitted. It is clear that, if there was a misinterpretation, it must have come later in the history of anatomy. But of that we shall find no trace any more than at this time. Here are the quotations from the Anatomy of Mon- dino which show that he practiced not one but many methods of making dissections, according to the pur- poses he had in view.

I do not consider separately here the anatomy of component parts, because their anatomy does not appear

63 ANATOMY TO THE RENAISSANCE periences in body-snatching as a young man, because no proper provision for the supplying of anatomical mate- rial had as yet been made by law, and bodies had to be obtained. The feeling of objection to having the bodies of friends anatomized is natural and not due to religion. It exists quite as strongly among the ignorant who have no religion as among the religiously inclined. It has not disappeared among the educated classes of our own time, religious or irreligious. If this is borne in mind, the history of the development of anatomy will be easier to understand. The first definite evidence in modern history for the existence of the practice of dissection is a famous law of the German Emperor, Frederick II., from the first half of the thirteenth century. This law was promul- gated for the two Sicilies, that is, for Southern Italy and Sicily proper, very probably in the year 1240. It has often been vaguely referred to, but its actual signifi- cance can only be understood from the terms of the law itself, which has been literally translated by Von Toply in his Studien Zur Geschichte der Anatomie in Im Mit- telalter.1 The paragraph with regard to dissection runs as follows: â€œAs an enactment that will surely prove beneficial to health, we decree that no surgeon will be allowed to practice, in case he has not a written testimonial, which he must present to the teachers in the medical faculty, that he has for at least a year applied himself to that department of medicine which is concerned with the teaching and practice of surgery, and that he has, above all, learned the anatomy of the human body in this man- ner, and that he is fully competent in this department 1 Deuticke Leipzig und Wien, 1898.

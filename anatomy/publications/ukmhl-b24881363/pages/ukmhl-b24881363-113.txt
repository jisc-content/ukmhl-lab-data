93 THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY mate and quite to be expected culmination of the ana- tomical interest which had been gradually rising to a climax in the Italian universities during the preceding century. It has a definite place in the evolution of sci- ence, and is not a sudden or unlooked for phenomenon. If there was any place in the world at the beginning of the sixteenth century in which the ecclesiastical au- thorities had much to say with regard to what should not be taught and what should not be studied in the uni- versities, it was Italy. In spite of this fact, all medical men who wanted to do post-graduate work in medicine went down into Italy. This was especially true for those who desired to obtain ampler opportunities for anatom- ical study than were afforded by the rest of Europe. In his maturer years as a student of medicine, Vesalius went down to Italy in order to avail himself of the mag- nificent field for investigation that was provided there. This favorable state of affairs as regards research in anatomy had existed for more than a century before his time. It continued to be true for at least two centuries after his time. As a matter of fact, Italy was to the rest of the world of the fifteenth and sixteenth and sev- enteenth centuries the home of post-graduate opportun- ities in all sciences as well as in medicine. These are not idle words, but are fully substantiated by the lives of the men who stand at the head of our modern medicine. More than a decade before Vesalius was born, Linacre, the distinguished English physician and founder of the Royal College of Physicians, went to Italy to complete his medical studies and incidentally also to round out his education in the midst of the new learning which was so thoroughly cultivated there. When Linacre was leaving Italy, with true classic spirit

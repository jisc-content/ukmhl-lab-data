Salerno, as we shall see in the chap- ter on The Papal Medical School, was always closely in touch with the ecclesiastical authorities, and especially with the Papacy. There was no hint of friction of any kind, either before or after this law of Frederick’s. The question of ecclesiastical interference with dissection does not seem to have arisen at all, much less to have proved an obstacle to the development of medical sci- ence.

We have already discussed the ques- tion whether Mondino was the first to do public anato- mies, and as to whether he performed only the few that by a narrow misunderstanding of certain of his own words have sometimes been ascribed to him.

I may say that he was one of the great Papal physicians of whom we shall have more to tell hereafter. ‘ ‘ Any comprehensive attempt to trace the real influ- ences to which was due so great a step as a return to the practice of dissections of the human body, seems to me must be very defective if it failed to take into con- sideration the influence of such a man as Thaddeus (Ital-

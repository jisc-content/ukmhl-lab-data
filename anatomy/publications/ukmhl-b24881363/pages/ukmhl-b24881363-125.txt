THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY 105 the modern time. There are men still alive in certain states of the Union who recall how much trouble they had to go to as medical students in order to procure a skeleton. If we go back fifty years, nearly every skele- ton that physicians had in their offices was obtained in some way almost as surreptitious as that just described, or was purchased through some underhand channel. They were dug up from potter’s field, or sometimes pro- cured from complacent prison officials, or occasionally stolen from respectable cemeteries. In this respect Ve- salius was not much worse off than were his medical colleagues for nearly three centuries and a half after his time in the northern countries. It was easier to procure such material in Italy. Vesalius had that precious quality that makes the investigator desire to see and know things for himself. He could not get opportunities for definite anatomical knowledge in the western part of Europe, so he gave up his practice, though Louvain, his native town, was a most promising place, having nearly 200,000 inhabitants and business relations with all the world at the moment, and went down into Italy where he knew that he could pursue his anatomical studies to his heart’s content. The tra- dition of the work that Zerbi and Achillini had done, and especially what Benivieni and Berengar had accom- plished within a few decades before this time, was com- monly known in all the medical schools of Europe, and many an ardent young anatomist in the West yearned for the opportunities and the incentive that he could obtain down there. Church influence was predominant; the ecclesiastics were the actual rulers of the universi- ties, but medical science, and above all anatomy, was being studied very ardently. Vesalius thus prompted.

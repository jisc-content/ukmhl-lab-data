That he was able to impress himself in the way in which history records that he did, both upon the general public and upon the scholastic foundations of Bologna, shows a strength of character and a mastery of the peculiar conditions of the moment in the fields of science and philosophy which made him a master and an inspirer. If he is to be considered in his proper histori- cal light, as one who declares that the knowledge of the structure of the human body to a most minute de- gree is the foundation upon which all rational medicine and surgery must be built, then it is impossible to exag- gerate the importance of the pivotal moment when, in the development of science, the human body began to be anatomized. Nor is any fault to be found with the custom which has crowned with the laurels of universal appreciation the names of those men who began and who continued anatomical study, who vulgarized the practice of dissection. ‘ ‘ fn my own investigations and reflections upon the conditions which led up to this happy renewal of scien- tific search into the composition of the body of man, it has seemed to me that writers have hitherto fallen short of tracing through to its ultimate source, the earlier spirit of enthusiasm for knowledge, of insight into the problems of disease, and of contempt for traditionary shackles, to the influence of which, as shown by the master, Taddeo, the latter work of the pupil, Mondino, was in great measure due.” Medici, in his History of the School of Anatomy at Bologna,1 quotes Sarti on The Distinguished Professors of the University of Bologna for proof of Taddeo’s fam- iliarity with dissection.

260 THE POPES AND SCIENCE were any lying sick who needed care and who should be sent to the hospital. They were expected also to pick up any of the infirm whom they might find along the streets and bring them to the hospital. The attitude which the religious attendants at the hospitals were to assume toward the patients upon whom they wait is clearly stated. In nearly all of the French hospitals of the thirteenth century, at least, the statutes in this matter do not dilfer much from this specimen : When the patient arrives he shall be received thus : First, having confessed his sins to the priest, he shall be communicated religiously and afterward be carried to bed and treated there as our Lord, according to the resources of the house; each day, before the repast of the brethren, he shall be given food with charity, and each Sunday the epistle and gospel shall be read and aspersion with holy water made with procession.” As is noted by Miss Speakman, all through the hos- pital statutes of these times the name of Masters or Lords is applied to the patients. The expression in Old French is Les Seignors Malades. The ordinary name for hospital was Maison Dieu, which has been well trans- lated “God’s Hostelry.” It is evident, then, though the origin of the phrase “Our Lords the Poor,” as ap- plied to hospital patients, has been said to be obscure, that it is only a re-echo of the scriptural expression, ‘ ‘ Whatsoever ye shall do, even to the least of these, be- hold ye do it unto Me. ” A quotation which was empha- sized in the old rule of St. Benedict, promulgated for the treatment of those received into the hospitality of the Benedictine monasteries, ‘ ‘ All guests shall be received as Christ, who Himself has said, ‘ I was a stranger and ye took Me in.’ ”

240 THE POPES AND SCIENCE results was the appointment of Malpighi, whose name has deservedly become attached to more structures in the human body because of tissues which he first studied in detail, than any other man in the history of medicine. Malpighi represents the beginning of most of the com- parative biological sciences, and his original observations upon plants, upon the lower animals, on fishes and then on the anatomical structure of man and the higher ani- mals, stamp him as an investigating genius of the highest order.

The closing years of Malpighiâ€™s life were rendered hap- pier, and his wonderful researches were as well re- warded as such work can be, by the estimation in which he was held at Rome. Malpighi was succeeded as Papal Physician and Pro- fessor in Rome by Tozzi, who is distinguished in the his- tory of medicine for his commentaries on the ancients rather than for original observation, but who was looked upon in his time as one of the most prominent physicians in Italy.

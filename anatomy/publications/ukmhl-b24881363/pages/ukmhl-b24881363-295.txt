THE FOUNDATION OF CITY HOSPITALS 275 There is no doubt at all, however, of the occurrence of real leprosy in many of the towns of the West from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, and the erection of these hospitals proved the best possible prophylatic against the further spread of the disease. Leprosy is contagious, but only mildly so. Years of intimate asso- ciation with a leper may, and usually do, bring about the communication of the disease to those around them, especially if they do not exercise rather carefully, cer- tain precise precautions as to cleanliness after personal contact or after the handling of things which have previ- ously been in the leperâ€™s possession. As the result of the existence of these houses of segregation, leprosy disappeared during the course of the next three centur- ies, and thus a great hygienic triumph was obtained by sanitary regulation. This successful sanitary and hygienic work, which brought about practically the complete obliteration of leprosy in the Middle Ages, furnished the first example of the possibility of eradicating a disease that has once become a serious scourge to mankind. That this should have been accomplished by a movement that had its greatest source in the thirteenth century is all the more surprising, since we are usually accustomed to think of the people of the times as sadly lacking in any interest in sanitary matters. The role of the Popes in the mat- ter is another striking feature well worthy of note. The significance of the success of this segregation method was lost upon men down almost to our own time. This was unfortunately because it was considered that most of the epidemic diseases were conveyed by the air. They were thought infectious and due to a climatic condition rather than contagious, that is, conveyed by actual con-

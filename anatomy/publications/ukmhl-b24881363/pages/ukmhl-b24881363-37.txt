17 INTRODUCTION lasted a thousand years was all the time occupied in checking the progress of thought (!) There are certainly one or two other instances, but those who make most of the outcry do not know them.” There is no doubt that Galileo was prosecuted by the Roman inquisition on account of his astronomical teach- ings. We would be the last to deny that this was a deplorable mistake made by persons in ecclesiastical au- thority, who endeavored to make a Church tribunal the judge of scientific truth, a function altogether alien to its character which it was not competent to exercise. The fact that this was practically the only time that this was done serves to show that it was an unfortunate in- cident, but not a policy. The mistake has been to con- clude that this was a typical case—one of many, more flagrant than the others. This single incident has in- deed made it impossible that anything of the same kind should ever occur again. It was rather because of the way in which Galileo urged his truths than because of the truths themselves that he was condemned. Even Professor Huxley, in a letter to Professor St. George Mivart, November 12th, 1885, said: “I gave some at- tention to the case of Galileo when I was in Italy, and I arrived at the conclusion that the Pope and the College of Cardinals had rather the best of it.” Before as well as after Galileo’s time scientific research was carried on ardently in the universities, especially in Italy. In the chapter on Science at the Medieval Uni- versities, we call attention to the many advances then made with regard to scientific questions in which the world is very much interested at the present time. A hundred years before Galileo’s time Copernicus went down to Italy to study astronomy and medicine, and

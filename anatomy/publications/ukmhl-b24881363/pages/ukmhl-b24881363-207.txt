187 CHURCH AND SURGERY Guy began practice in Lyons, whence he was called to Avignon by Clement VI. as ‘ venerabilis et circumspec- tus vir, dominus Guido de Cauliaco, canonicus et prsepo- situs ecclesias Sancti Justi Lugduni, medicusque domini nostri Papse.' In Avignon he stayed, while other phy- sicians fled, to minister to the victims of the plague (A. D., 1348), and he may have attended Laura in spite of Pe- trarch’s tirades against all physicians and even against Guy himself. His description of this epidemic is terri- ble in its naked simplicity. He did not, indeed, himself escape, for he had an attack with bubo, and was ill for six weeks. He gave succor also in a later epidemic in Avignon, in 1360. His ‘ Chirurgia Magna ’ or Inventa- rium seu Collectorium Artis Chirurgicalis Medicinae—so called in distinction to the meagre little handbooks or Chirurgiae Parvae compiled from the larger treatises— was in preparation in 1363. This great work I have studied carefully, and not without prejudice ; and yet I cannot wonder that Fallopius compared the author to Hippocrates, or that John Freind calls him the Prince of Surgeons. It is rich, aphoristic, orderly and precise. As a clerk he wrote in Latin, in the awkward hybrid tongue that medical Latin then was, containing many Arabian, Provencal and French words, but very little Greek.” We have seen that there was great surgery in Italy, in France, and in the Netherlands, but it had also crossed the channel into England. There was a famous English surgeon during the four- the old mode of view has so firm a hold on him that he is not open to conviction. A little later in this same passage he speaks of taking up the study of Chauliac, pre- judiced against him, and being convinced of his greatness against his will. Verily history has been a conspiracy against the truth, in which many people have joined almost unconsciously, led astray by feeling, not intellect.

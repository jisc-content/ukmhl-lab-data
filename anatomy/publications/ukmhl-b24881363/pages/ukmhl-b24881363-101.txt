81 ANATOMY TO THE RENAISSANCE tinued to be even to a greater degree than before the Mecca, for medical students who wished to do original work in anatomy. During the last fifty years of the fifteenth century anatomy began its modern phase, and original work of a very high order was accomplished. There are five names that deserve to be mentioned in this period. They are Gabriele Zerbi, Achillini, Beren- gar of Carpi, Matthew of Gradi and Benivieni. Each of these men did work that was epoch-making in anat- omy, and each has a place in the history of the science that will never be lost. Zerbi, who did his work at Verona, traced the olfac- tory nerves and describes the nerve supply of the special senses more completely than it had ever been done before. After his time it was only a question of filling in the details of this subject. Achillini added much to our knowledge of the anatomy of the head, being the first to describe the small bones of the ear and also to recognize the orifices of Whartonâ€™s ducts. Besides this, which would have been quite enough to have given him a place in the history of anatomy, he added important details to what had been previously known with regard to the intestines, and described very clearly the ileo- cecal valve and suggested its function. Matthew of Gradi, or De Gradibus, was the first, according to Pro- fessor Turner in his article on Anatomy in the Encyclo- paedia Britannica, who represented the ovaries in the correct light as regards their anatomical relations and their function. The most important of these fifteenth century investi- gators in pure anatomy, however, is Berengarius or Ber- engar of Carpi, who did his work at Bologna at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth cen-

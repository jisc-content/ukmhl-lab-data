THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY 109 the Court with his intellectual talk, telling them some of the fairy tales of that realm of science which he had left, and of the later achievements of which news came to him, scantily, fitfully and from afar.” Professor White has gone much farther than Sir Michael Foster. The English physiologist knew too much about the history of medicine in Italy even to hint at any ecclesiastical opposition with regard to Vesalius. President White, however, has no scruples in the mat- ter. This makes an excellent opportunity to write the kind of history that is to be found in his book. Appar- ently forgetful of the thought that the Emperor Charles V. was not at all likely to take as his body physician a man who had been in trouble with the ecclesiastical au- thorities in Italy, he insists that the reason why Vesalius dedicated his great work on anatomy to the Emperor Charles V. was “ to shield himself as far as possible in the battle which he foresaw must come. ’ ’ Later he suggests that it was only the favor of the Emperor saved him from the ecclesiastical authorities. All that has been said by historians with regard to the reasons for Vesalius’s acceptance of the post of physi- cian to the Emperor Charles V. can only have come from men who either did not know or had for the moment for- gotten the story of Vesalius’s ancestry. The family tradition of having one of its members as physician to the Court of the German Emperor was four generations old when Vesalius accepted the position. Vesalius’s great-grandfather occupied the position of physician-in-ordinary to Marie of Burgundy, the wife of the German Emperor Maximilian I., the distinguished patron of letters in the Renaissance period. He lived to an advanced age as a professor of medicine at Louvain.

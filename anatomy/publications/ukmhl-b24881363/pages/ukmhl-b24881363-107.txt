87 ANATOMY TO THE RENAISSANCE All this of anatomical development in Italy at universi- ites that were directly under the ecclesiastical authorities would seem to settle all question of interference by the Popes or the Church with any phase of anatomical de- velopment. It does not seem sufficient for Dr. White, however. When I called attention to all these details of the history of anatomy, long before the reformation and before Vesalius, Dr. White’s response was the following paragraph in which he explains how dissection came to be praqticed at all, and reiterates not only his belief that Pope Boniface’s bull prevented dissection, but even insists on what cannot but seem utterly absurd to any one who has read even the brief account I have given here, that ex- cept at one or two places, and then only to a very limited degree, dissection was not practiced at all. Here is how the history of dissection must be viewed according to Dr. White: — But Dr. Walsh elsewhere falls back on the fact that shortly after the decree of Pope Boniface VIII., which struck so severe a blow at dissection, the Venetian Senate passed a decree ordaining that a dissection of the human body should be made every year in the city of Venice, and he leaves his readers to conclude that this effectually proves that dissection had not really been discouraged by the Pope.

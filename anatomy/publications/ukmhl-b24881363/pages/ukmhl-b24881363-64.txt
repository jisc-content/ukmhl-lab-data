THE POPES AND SCIENCE 44 clearly in the fresh subject, but rather in those macer- ated in water.” (Leaf 2, lines 8-13.) “ . . . . these differences are more noticeable in the cooked or perfectly dried body, and so you need not be concerned about them, as perhaps I wiU make an anatomy upon such a one at another time and will write what I observe with my own senses, as I have proposed from the beginning.” (Leaf 60, lines 14-17.) ‘ ’ What the members are to which these nerves come cannot well be seen in such dissection as this, but it should be liquified with rain water, and this is not con- templated in the present body.” (Leaf 60, lines 31-33.) “After the veins you will note many muscles and many large and strong cords, the complete anatomy of which you will not endeavor to find in such a body, but in a body dried in the sun for three years, as I have de- monstrated at another time ; I also declared completely their number, and wrote the anatomy of the muscles of the arms, hands and feet in a lecture which I gave over the first, second, third and fourth subjects.” As must be clear to anyone, many of these expressions are, as Professor Pilcher insists, intelligible only if we accept the conclusion that their author had done many dissections, under many and varying circumstances, dur- ing his career as an anatomist before writing this vol- ume. We have other evidence, of a much more direct character, for this fact. Mondino uses the expression, that he had demonstrated many times a certain anatom- ical feature which could only be the subject of demon- stration after dissection. The expression occurs in a description of the hypo-gastric region which he calls the sumen. Through this region, he says, there pass to the surface certain veins which transmit fluid in the fetus

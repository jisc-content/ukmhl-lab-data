In the medieval universities, medi- cine particularly occupied a very large share of atten- tion ; but all the physical sciences were the subject not only of distant curiosity, but of careful investigation, many of them along lines that are supposed to be dis- tinctly modern, yet which are really as old as the uni- versity movement.

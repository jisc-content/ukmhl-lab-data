179 CHURCH AND SURGERY knew that it could do no harm, and had probably seen, as has many a physician and surgeon of the modern time, that such a practice does good, if not by the direct interference of Providence, then at least by the calm- ness of mind which it superinduces in the patient. In the same way Mondeville was not averse to his patients going on pilgrimages. He did not expect that they would all be cured miraculously, but according to Pagel, his discussion of this subject is quite modern. Travel and change of scene would do good anyhow in many cases, expectancy would help the patient’s condition, and the hope aroused was also good. The best merit, however, of this French surgeon is undoubtedly the immense in- fluence which he exerted over his great successor, Guy de Chauliac. We are really only beginning to accumulate knowledge with regard to the surgery of the thirteenth and four- teenth centuries. Pagel has devoted three very full pages, in his compressed account of surgery, to John Yperman, a surgeon of the early fourteenth century of whom practically nothing was known until about twenty- five years ago, when the Belgian historian Broeck brought to light his works and gathered some details of his life. He was a pupil of Lanfranc’s, and at the end of the thirteenth century studied at Paris on a scholar- ship provided by his native town of Ypres, which delib- erately sent him in order that he might become expert in surgery. This may seem a strange thing for a me- dieval town to do, at least it may seem so to those who have been accustomed to think little of the Middle Ages, but it will not to anyone who knows anything about the wonderful civic spirit of the Free Towns. In the chapter on Science at the Medieval Universities I have quoted

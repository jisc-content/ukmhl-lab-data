361 UNIVERSITY MAN AND SCIENCE nature are supposed to be the first who went deeply enough into these subjects to make them material for literature. Here, however, is Dante describing, in a few picturesque words, characteristic peculiarities of birds and insects, which our modern writers spend pages over, yet tell us scarcely more about them. A little knowledge of Dante is evidently the best antidote that our genera- tion can have for that foolish persuasion that the Middle Ages were ignorant of science and that the universities taught nothing but nonsense about nature. I am tempted to add just a few pargraphs with regard to another aspect of Dante’s scientific interests which assimilates him to the modern educated man. Education itself would seem to be one of the sciences the develop- ment of which was surely left to a late and more con- scious age. There are, however, as has been pointed out by Brother Azarias, quite enough materials in Dante’s works to show that a serious student who was, however, only a literary man and not an educator, had many thoughts with regard to the practical side of education, and had come to many conclusions with regard to how it should be carried on, that are anticipations of the most fruitful thoughts of our modern educators and that have formed the subject of many theses on education down to our own day.

Brother Azarias says “It is the mission of the poet to reflect in his work the predominant, all-pervading spirit and views of his age. Now, in his day, the universities were the con-

19 INTRODUCTION ended his days in the Papal capital, amidst the friend- ship of all the high ecclesiastics and with the social in- timacy of the Pope. From the beginning of the six- teenth century Bologna is a Papal city, but its medical school, far from declining after it came under Papal jurisdiction, was even more brilliant than before, and soon came even to outshine its previously successful rival, Padua. What we would say then, is that the story of the sup- posed opposition of the Church and the Popes and the ecclesiastical authorities to science in any of its branches, is founded entirely on mistaken notions. Most of it is quite imaginary. Much of it is due to the exaggeration of the significance of the Galileo incident. Only those who know nothing about the history of medicine and of science continue to harbor it. That Dr. Whiteâ€™s book, contradicted as it is so directly by all our serious his- tories of medicine and of science, should have been read by so many thousands in this country, and should have been taken seriously by educated men, physicians, teach- ers, and even professors of science who want to know the history of their own sciences, only shows how easily even supposedly educated men may be led to follow their prejudices rather than their mental faculties, and em- phasizes the fact that the tradition that there is no good that can possibly come out of the Nazareth of the times before the reformation, still dominates the intellects of many educated people who think that they are far from prejudice and have minds perfectly open to conviction. We would not leave the impression, moreover, that it was in medicine alone that the misunderstood Middle Ages made distinct progress in science. This is true in every department of what we now call natural science.

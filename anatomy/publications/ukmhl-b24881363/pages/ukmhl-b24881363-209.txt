189 CHURCH AND SURGERY that a more thorough consideration of Ardernâ€™s work is impossible, because the greater part of what he wrote remains as yet unprinted. In general, when we consider how difficult was the task of making copies of works on surgery by hand, and especially such as contain numerous illustrations, the wonder grows that we should have so much about the surgery of these centuries rather than so little. Some of these works have been preserved for us by the merest chance. There have been many centuries since their time, when what these surgeons wrote would have been thought of very little value because physicians were not educated up to them. In spite of this liability to loss, which must have caused the destruction of many valu- able works, we still have enough to show us what won- derful men were these surgeons of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, who anticipated our best thinking of the modern times in many of the most difficult problems. It is only during the last twenty-five years that anything like justice has been done them. The only way to know what these men did and taught is to read their own works, and these have been buried in manu- script or hidden away in large folio volumes, printed very early in the history of printing, and considered so valu- able that consultation of them was almost resented by librarians.

SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 45 during the time of its life in utero. For this reason they are better studied in the unborn than in the fully devel- oped, since they lose their function as soon as complete development is reached. In this description Mondino uses the words “egohoc modo multitotiensmonstravi.’’ As with regard to this, so as to another bit of evidence of Mondino’s frequency of dissection, Professor Pilcher has supplied the material. He says in his article on the Mondino Myth, already cited : “Shortly after his (Mondino’s) death, the young Guy de Chauliac, of Montpelier, came to Bologna to study anatomy under the tuition of Mondino’s successor, Ber- trucius. When he wrote his own treatise, ‘ La Grande Chirurgie, ’ thirty years later, he prefaced it with an ap- preciation of the study of anatomy, saying: ‘ It is nec- essary and useful to every physician to know first of all anatomy ’; and that a knowledge of anatomy was to be acquired by two means ; ‘ these are, ’ he says, ‘ the study of books, a means useful indeed, but not sufficient to ex- plain those things which can only be appreciated by the senses ; the other, experimentally on the dead body, ac- cording to the treatise of Mondinus, of Bologna, which he has written, and which (experimental anatomy on the cadaver) he (Mondinus) has done many times’— ‘ et ipsam fecit mvltitoties.’ ” Besides this evidence we have details of the lives of two of Mondino’s assistants which furnish further proofs of the frequency of dissection at the University of Bo- logna during these first two decades of the fourteenth century, which, it will be recalled, are also the first two decades after the promulgation of Pope Boniface’s bull. Curiously enough, one of these assistants was a young woman who, as was not infrequently the custom at this

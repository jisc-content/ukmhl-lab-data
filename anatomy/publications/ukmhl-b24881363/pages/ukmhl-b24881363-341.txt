CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE 321 volumes on the vegetables and plants were reproduced under the editorship of Meyer, the historian of botany in Germany, and published in Berlin (1867). All Albert’s books are available in modern editions. In a word, there was scarcely a subject in natural science which Albert did not treat, in what would now be considered a formal serious volume, and no depart- ment of science that he did not illuminate in some way, not only by the collection of information that had previously been in existence, but also by his own observations, and especially by his interpretations of the significance of the various phenomena that had been observed. His work is especially noteworthy for its lack of dependence on authority and the straightforward way in which the great pioneer of modern science made bis ob- servations. Some of Albert’s contemporaries, and especially his pupils, were almost as distinguished as he was himself in the physical sciences. In a previous chapter we spoke particularly of Roger Bacon’s attitude toward the physical sciences, above all in what concerns the experimental method. He was typically modern in the standpoint that he assumed, as the only one by which knowledge of the things of nature can be obtained. It will be interesting now to see the number of things which Friar Bacon succeeded in dis- covering by the application of the principle of testing everything by personal observation, of not accepting things on second-hand authorities, and of not being afraid to say, “ I do not know, ’ ’ in trying to learn for himself. His discoveries will seem almost incredible to a modem student of science and of education who has known nothing before of the progress of science made

THE POPES AND SCIENCE 312 but it is interesting to realize that in the olden time they theorized about the constitution of matter at the univer- sities of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries just as we do now, and most surprisingly came to conclusions Quite like ours. Their thoughts not only concerned the same subject, but were worked out in the same way. It is idle to say that they knew nothing about it and hit on their theoi y by chance. As a matter of fact, they knew very little, if any less about it than we do, for our igno- rance on this subject is monumental, and they antici- pated our latest thinking by seven centuries. Many have been the divagations of thought since that time, but now we return to their conclusions. It is chastening to the modern mind, so confident of the advances that have been made by these latter generations, “the heirs of all the ages in the foremost files of time,” to find that we are so little farther on in an important problem than these men of the thirteenth century. Other basic problems with regard to matter and force filled the minds of the medieval schoolmen quite as they do those of the modern generations. For instance, they occupied themselves with the question of the indestruc- tibility of matter, and also, strange as it may seem, with the conservation of energy. We have presumably learned so much by experimental demonstration and original observation in the physical sciences in the modern times, and especially during the precious nineteenth century, that any thinking of the medieval mind along these lines might, in the opinion of those who know nothing of what they speak, be at once set aside without further ques- tion as preposterous, or at best nugatory. The opinions of medieval scholars in these matters would be pre- sumed, without more ado, to have been so entirely spec-

313 CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE ulative as to deserve no further attention. Nothing could well be farther from the truth than this. No- where will more marvelous anticipations of what is most modern in science be found than in some of these considerations of basic principles in the physical sciences. For instance, Thomas Aquinas, usually known as St. Thomas, in a series of lectures given at the University of Paris toward the end of the third quarter of the thir- teenth century, stated as the most important conclusion with regard to matter that ‘ ‘ Nihil omnino in nihilum redigetur. — Nothing at all will ever be reduced to noth- ingness. ” By this, as is very evident from the context, he meant to say that matter would never be annihilated and could never be destroyed. It might be changed in various ways, but it could never go back into the noth- ingness from which it had been taken by the creative act. Annihilation was pronounced as not being a part of the scheme of things as far as the human mind could hope to fathom its meaning. In this sentence, then, Thomas of Aquin was proclaim- ing the doctrine of the indestructibility of matter. It was not until well on in the nineteenth century that the chemists and physicists of modern times realized the truth of this great principle. The chemists had seen matter change its form in many ways, had seen it dis- appear apparently in the smoke of fire or evaporate under the influence of heat, but investigation proved that if care were taken in the collection of the gases that came off under these circumstances, of the ashes of combus- tion and of the residue of evaporation, all the original material that had been contained in the supposedly dis- appearing substance could be recovered, or at least com-

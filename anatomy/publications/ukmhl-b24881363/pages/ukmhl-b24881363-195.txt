175 CHURCH AND SURGERY of what is so frequently said about scholasticism having invaded the realm of medicine, and the study of books having replaced the study of patients. It is not sur- prising that with his study of cases William should have recognized the danger of wounds of the neck, nor that he should have taught the suture of divided nerves. It cannot fail to be a matter of surprise, however, that he should have any hint of the possibility of union by first intention, for that is supposed to be quite recent, and the knowledge he displays of venereal diseases is sup- posed to have come into medicine and surgery at least two centuries later. Allbutt next takes up Salicet’s great pupil Lanfranc. “ Lanfranc’s ‘Chirurgia Magna’ was a great work, written by a reverent but independent follower of Sali- cet. He distinguished between venous and arterial hemorrhage, and used styptics (rabbit’s fur, aloes, and white of egg was a popular styptic in older surgery), digital compression for an hour, or in severe cases liga- ture. His chapter on injuries of the head is one of the classics of medieval surgery. Clerk as he was, Lanfranc nevertheless saw but the more clearly the danger of separating surgery from medicine. ‘ Good God!' he exclaims, ‘ why this abandoning of operations by phy- sicians to lay persons, disdaining surgery, as I perceive, because they do not know how to operate ... an abuse which has reached such a point that the vulgar begin to think that the same man cannot know medicine and sur- gery ... I say, however, that no man can be a good physician who has no knowledge of operative sur- gery ; a knowledge of both branches is essential. ’ (Chir. Magna.) Is it not strange that this ancient was wiser than most of us are even yet.”

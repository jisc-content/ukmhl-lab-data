SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 57 hint as to where it may be really found. It is in an ap- pendix to this work, added after Boniface’s death. It would be rather difficult, then, and would require some special knowledge and no little patience on the part of a subsequent collator of historical sources to find the bull, unless he were determined on getting at the bottom of this whole question. As a consequence Daunou’s asser- tion has remained practically unchallenged for the better part of a century, though many scholars who were famil- iar with Boniface’s sixth book have doubtless realized its falsity, but owing to the fact that they would not or- dinarily come across the bull in their direct reading of Boniface’s famous volume, would not be in a position to contradict its misquotation. If looked at in this way, Daunou’s passage in the Histoire Litteraire would seem to be a deliberate and very clever and, unfortunately, successful perversion of history. Daunou, who was a deep student of Papal affairs and whose knowledge of the history of the Papacy would not be likely to have missed so important a detail, might very well have known, that about a half a century be- fore the time when he wrote asserting that this bull of Boniface VIII. had prevented dissection, someone who had a doubt on the subject asked the ecclesiastical au- thorities at Rome, whether this Papal document was to be considered as referring in any way to the practice of dissection, or the cutting up of human bodies for ana- tomical purposes.

In order to obtain a proper appreciation of this, all that is necessary is to study the works of the investigating scholars of the early history of the universities, and see how much that is considered very modern they antici- pated in their writings. They must be read for them- selves, not be judged by excerpts chosen by prejudiced readers, much less by critics who were bent on not find- ing anything good in the Middle Ages.

The precious lesson that men may learn from the unfortunate misunderstanding, however, is how much old-time prejudice still dominates the atti- tude even of scholarsâ€”nay, even of scientists and edu- cators, with regard to certain periods in history. To most people it will be utterly uncomprehensible, however, that after all that they have heard about Church opposition to science and Papal discouragement of education as dangerous to faith, there should now be an absolute denial of the supposed grounds for the as- sertions in this matter.

CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE 317 day, in spite of the immense progress made during the nineteenth century, has praised Albert’s work very highly. Almost needless to say, Humboldt was possessed of a thorough critical faculty and had a very wide range of knowledge, so that he was in an eminently proper position to judge of Albert’s work. He has summed up his appreciation briefly as follows : “Albertus Magnus was equally active and influential in promoting the study of natural science. and ot the Aristotelian philosophy. His works contain some ex- ceedingly acute remarks on the organic structure and physiology of plants. One of his works, bearing the title of ‘ Liber Cosmographicus de Natura Locorum, is a species of physical geography. I have found m it con- siderations on the dependence of temperature concur- rently on latitude and elevation, and on the eftect ot different angles of incidence of the sun’s rays in heating the ground, which have excited my surprise.” I have thought that perhaps the best way to bring out properly Albert’s knowledge in the physical sciences would be to take up Humboldt’s headings in their order and illustrate them by quotations from the great schol- ar’s writings—the only scholar to whom the epithet has been applied in all history—and from condensed accounts as they appear in his life written by Sighart.1 These will serve to show at once the extent of Albert’s knowl- edge and the presumptuous ignorance of those who make little of the science of the medieval period. When we have catalogued, for instance, the many facts with regard to astronomy and the physics of. light that are supposed to be of much later entrance into the sphere of human knowledge that were grasped by Al- 1 Sighart.

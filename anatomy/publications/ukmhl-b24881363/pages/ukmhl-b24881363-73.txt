SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 53 medical schools were, the more dissection was done in them; that dissection was most common in Rome, at least during the latter part of this period ; that the golden age of anatomy developed most luxuriantly in Bologna when that was a Papal city, and in Rome itself ; and that in general the Popes must be looked upon as having fostered and patronized the medical sciences and anatomy in every possible way, while there is not the slightest hint anywhere to be found of the ecclesiastical opposition that is supposed to have dominated these cen- turies of medical history.

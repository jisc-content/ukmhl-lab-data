60 THE POPES AND SCIENCE original meaning and set up as a serious stumbling block to the development of science or education in some way. It is quoted confidently by some one without much au- thority. Others who are glad of the opportunity to have such an objection to urge against the Papacy, take it up eagerly, do not look it up in the original, absolutely fail to consider the circumstances in which it was issued, and then spread it broadcast. Of course it is accepted by unthinking readers, whose prejudices lead them to believe that this is what was to be expected anyhow. It may be that history, as is the case in anatomy, absolutely contradicts the assertion. That makes no difference. History is ignored and treatises are written showing how much science would have developed only for Papal opposition, by people who know nothing at all about the real story of the development of science. The real his- tory of anatomy, showing very clearly how much was done for the science by the Popes and ecclesiastics, will be told in the following chapters. modo adversatur Bonifacii Institutioni. ... Ille quidem poenam excommunica- tionis indicit Pontifici solo remittendam, iis omnibus qui audeant cuiuscumque de- functi corpus exenterare, ac illud membratim vel in frustra immaniter concidere ab ossibus tegnmentum carnis excutere. Tamen ex reliquis ejusdem constitutionis parti- bus clare deprehenditur, hanc poenam illis infligi qui sepulta corpora e tumulis eru- entes ipsa nefario scelere in frustra secabant ut alio deferrent, alioque sepulchro col- locarent. Quamobrem membrorum incisio minime interdicitur, quae adeo necessaria est medicinae facultatem exercentibus.‚Äù

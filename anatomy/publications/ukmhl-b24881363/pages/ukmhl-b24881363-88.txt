THE POPES AND SCIENCE 68 this quotation is enough absolutely to prove that Taddeo had done dissections, yet it would be hard to understand it unless some such interpretation is made. Taddeo was asked to decide a medico-legal question with regard to a pregnant woman. He refused, however, with a mod- esty that might well be commended to medico-legal ex- perts of more modern times, to answer the question decisively, because he had never made a dissection of a pregnant woman. Sarti argues that it is evident from this that he had dissected other bodies more easy to ob- tain than those of pregnant women, or else that he had had the opportunity to make observations on them when dissected by others. Certain of Taddeo’s contemporaries must have had the incentive of his example to help them to a knowledge of human anatomy, for they surely could not have accom- plished all that they did in surgery without experience in dissection, yet Taddeo was looked up to as a master by all of them. Anyone who has read the contributions to surgery of William of Salicet and his great pupil Lanfranc, even if only what we give with regard to them in our chapter on Surgery during the Middle Ages, cannot but be im- pressed with the idea that they must have done human dissections. They do not mention this fact explicitly, but portions of their surgical works are taken up with the consideration of applied anatomy. They discuss the relations of various structures to one another, especially with reference to the surgery of them. Von Toply, in his Studies on the • History of Anatomy in the Middle Ages, says that the anatomies written before William’s chapters on applied anatomy, were most of them purely theoretic discussions meant to be guides for internal

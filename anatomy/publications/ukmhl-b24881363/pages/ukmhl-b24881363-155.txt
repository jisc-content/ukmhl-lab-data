SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF CHEMISTRY 135 SJO 4 Stone ; A Treatise on Compounds ; a book of eight chap- ters on the Philosopher’s Stone. Most of these are to be found in his works under the general heading ‘ ‘ Theat- rum Chemicum.” Thomson, in his “History of Chem- istry,” says, that they are, in general, plain and intel- ligible. Albertus Magnus’s most famous pupil was the celebrated Thomas Aquinas. Three of his works are on chemistry: The Intimate Secrets of Alchemy ; on the Essence and Substance of Minerals; and finally, later in life, the Wonders of Alchemy. It is in this last work, it is said, that the word amalgam occurs for the first time. While Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus were working in France and Germany, Roger Bacon was doing work of similar nature at Oxford in England. Altogether, he has eighteen treatises on chemical prob- lems. Some of these contain wonderful anticipations of modern chemistry. After Roger Bacon came Raymond Lully, who wrote, in all, sixteen treatises on chemical subjects. At about the same time, Arnold of Villanova was teaching medicine at Paris and paying special atten- tion to chemistry. From him there are twenty-one treatises on chemical subjects still extant. Arnold of Villanova died on the way to visit Pope Clement V., the immediate predecessor of John, who lay sick unto death at Avignon. It is evident, then, that there was no spirit of opposi- tion to chemistry gradually forming itself in ecclesiasti- cal circles, and about to be expressed in a decree by John. The chemists of the thirteenth century had been among the most distinguished churchmen of the period. One of them at least, Thomas Aquinas, had been de- clared a saint. Another, Albertus Magnus, has been given the title of Blessed, signifying that his life and mt

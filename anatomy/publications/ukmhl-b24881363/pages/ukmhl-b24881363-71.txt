51 SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION bodies each year. It is a fact of which we have ample testimony, that Mundinus, the great anatomist preced- ing Vesalius, only dissected three human bodies with his classes during his entire career. So far from effectually helping anatomy, these permissions served really to fasten the idea upon the European mind that dissection to any considerable extent by anatomical investigators ought not to be allowed, and, as a matter of fact, it was not until Vesalius, in spite of theological opposition, braved calumny, persecution, and possibly death, that this ecclesiastical barrier to investigation was broken through. ’ ’ (Italics ours.) Since Professor White has insisted so much on the sig- nificance of these permissions, a discussion of them will not be out of place. There are records of a certain small number of permissions to dissect having been granted by the Popes to various universities during the four- teenth and fifteenth centuries. These are so few, how- ever, that it would seem that if they represented the only opportunities afforded for dissection, then the de- velopment of anatomy must have been much hampered. With regard to this, it may be said that if the Popes gave permission for dissection, then this practice was not forbidden by them. Here is the proof of it out of the mouths of those who say the opposite. Why should a permission be necessary, however, will be asked ? At the present moment such formal permissions are required quite as much in all civilized countries as they were during the Middle Ages. In certain parts of the United States a bond has to be filed by applicants before permission to dissect will be given. Dissection is recog- nized generally as a practice that needs definite regu- lation. Without such regulation all sorts of abuses

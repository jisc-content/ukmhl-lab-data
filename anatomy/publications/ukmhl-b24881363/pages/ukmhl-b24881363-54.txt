34 THE POPES AND SCIENCE IX., of France, and a number of his relatives who per- ished on the ill-fated crusade in Egypt in 1270, are said to have been brought back to France in this fashion. The body of the famous German Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, who was drowned in the river Saleph near Jerusalem, was also treated thus in order that the re- mains might be transported to Germany without serious decomposition being allowed to disturb the ceremonials of subsequent obsequies. Such examples were very likely to be imitated by many.

It is almost need- less to say to our generation that it was eminently un- hygienic. Any modern authority in sanitation would at once declare against it, and the custom would be put an end to without more ado. There can be no doubt at all then that Pope Boniface VIII. accomplished good, not evil, by the publication of this bull. So anyone with modern views as to the danger of disease from the fool- ish custom which it abolished would at once have de- clared, and yet, by a perversion of its signification, it came to be connected with a supposed prohibition of dissection.

That is what Dr. White asserts. He shows, moreover, in his History of

235 PAPAL MEDICAL SCHOOL Roman Medical School will be well understood fiom the fact that, when his great work De Re Anatomica was published after his death by his sons, Pope Pius IV. ac- cepted the dedication of it. This was of course not an unusual thing, for many books on other sciences were dedicated to the Popes, and the example thus set was sub- sequently imitated. Twenty-five years later, Professoi Piccolomini dedicated his Anatomical Lectures to Pope Sixtus V. Subsequent anatomical publications of the Papal Medical School were issued under like patronage. The famous edition of Eustachius’s anatomical sketches, published under the editorship of Lancisi, is a notable example of this, and went to press mainly at the ex- pense of Pope Clement XI., who realized how valuable they were likely to be for the teaching of anatomy. These two great discoverers in anatomy, Columbus and Eustachius, were succeeded, as is so often the case in the history of university faculties, by a man more ca- pable of writing about great discoveries than of making them himself. This was Piccolomini, who devoted him- self to showing how much the ancients had taught about anatomy, though at the same time he also made clear the place occupied by modern anatomical discoveries. While his name is not attached to any great discovery in the science of anatomy, he is generally acknowledged to have been one of the great teachers of his time and one who was needed just then in order to make people re- alize how the old and the new in anatomy must be co- ordinated. Piccolomini’s successor in the chair of anat- omy at Rome was another original genius and investigator whose name, however, and fame has never been as great among English-speaking people as in Italy, or among the Latin races generally. The fact that he was a rival

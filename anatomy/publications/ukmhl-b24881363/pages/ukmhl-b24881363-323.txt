CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE 303 Anyone who studies the works of the professors at these medieval universities can scarcely fail to become entirely sympathetic toward these scholars, who devoted themselves with so much ardor to every form of learn- ing that interested them, and who did not fail to accom- plish at least as much for future generations, as any other generation of university men in history. Profes- sor George Saintsbury in his book On the Rise of Ro- mance and the Flourishing of Allegory, which is really the story of thirteenth century literature in Europe, in the series of Periods of European Literature,1 in sum- ming up the contributions of these medieval professors to human knowledge, said : “Yet, there has always, in generous souls who have some tincture of philosophy, subsisted a curious kind of sympathy and yearning over the work of these genera- tions of mainly disinterested scholars, who, whatever they were, were thorough, and whatever they could not do, could think. And there have been in these latter days some graceless ones who have asked whether the science of the nineteenth century, after an equal inter- val, will be of any more positive value—whether it will not have even less comparative interest than that which appertains to the Scholasticism of the thirteenth.” Nothing could well be less true than the impression that philosophy and theology were the exclusive subjects of the medieval university curriculum. If because our modern universities devote a great amount of time to physical science in its various forms, and more of their publications concern this department of educational work than any other, it were to be said by some future generation that our universities occupied themselves on Post-Graduate Work in the same book, from which a certain amount of material is used again here. 1 Scribners, 1896.

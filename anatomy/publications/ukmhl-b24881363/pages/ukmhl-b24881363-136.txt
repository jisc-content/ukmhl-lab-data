He was not satisfied with the critical examination of mere structure, but extended his researches into the more subtle, difficult and important investigation of the phys- iological function. He has been most aptly styled the Claude Bernard of the sixteenth century. The work of Columbus is a masterpiece of method and purity of style, as well as on account of its richness in facts and observations. He spent over forty years in these studies and researches. He dissected an extraordinary number of human bodies. It must have been an age of remark- able tolerance for scientific investigation, for in a single year he dissected no less than fourteen bodies. He also entered the crypts and catacombs of ancient churches, where the bones of the dead had been preserved and had accumulated century after century, and there, with unwearied care, he handled and compared over a half million of human skulls. This account was written by Dr. George Jackson Fisher in his ‘‘ Historical and Bibliographical Notes” for the Annals of Anatomy and Surgery (Brooklyn, 1878- 1880). All the material that Dr. Fisher used in his sketch is to be found in Roth’s “Life of Yesalius,” p. 256. Now, Columbus was a contemporary of Vesalius, and worked with him at Bologna. The years of their lives correspond almost exactly. When Vesalius left Padua to become the royal physician to Charles V., it was Columbus who succeeded him. Later he taught also at Pisa. Then, strange as it may seem for those who have put any faith in Dr. White’s excursion into medical science, he was invited to become Professor of

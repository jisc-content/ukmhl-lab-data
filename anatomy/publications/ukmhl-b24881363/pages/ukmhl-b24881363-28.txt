8 THE POPES AND SCIENCE all over the continent and even England went for the sake of the magnificent opportunities provided. It was literally true, in spite of the tradition of Church opposi- tion to medical science, that the nearer to Rome the uni- versity the better its medical school; and as we shall see, Rome itself had the best medical school in the world for two centuries, while its greatest rival, often ahead of it in scientific achievement, always its peer, was the medical school of Bologna in the Papal States, directly under the control of the Popes since the beginning of the sixteenth century. Dr. White has said just the opposite of this in a well- known passage of his book, in which he assures his readers that “in proportion as the grasp of theology upon education tightened, medicine declined; and in proportion as that grasp relaxed, medicine has been de- veloped.” The reason for such a statement is that he knew nothing about the history of medicine and surgery in these medieval centuries and thought there was none. This is a characteristic example of his mode of writing the History of the (Supposed) Warfare of Theology with Science in Christendom. This much will give some idea of the value of his book as a work of reference. After knowing something of these wonderful develop- ments of medieval medical science, it is to be hoped that no one will listen hereafter to the ignorant assertions of those who talk of the suppression of medical knowledge at this time. William of Salicet and Lanfranc were both of them clerics, that is, they belonged to the ecclesias- tical body and had taken minor orders, though they were not priests, as priests were for obvious reasons not al- lowed to do surgical operations, it being as repugnant to human feelings in the Middle Ages as it is now, that

Down at Montpelier, Gilbert the Englishman taught that small-pox patients should be treated in rooms with red hangings, red curtains being especially advised for the doors and windows. This is what Finsen re-discov- ered in the nineteenth century, and for it was given the Nobel prize in the twentieth century.

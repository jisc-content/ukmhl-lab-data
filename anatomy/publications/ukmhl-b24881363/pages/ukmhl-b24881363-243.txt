223 PAPAL MEDICAL SCHOOL Pope Boniface VIII., who was himself one of the dis- tinguished scholars of his time, determined that, besides the university of the Papal Court, which had existed for nearly a century at Rome, but which was mainly occu- pied with philosophy and theology and mainly attended by ecclesiastics, there should also be a university of the City of Rome for the people of his capital. This deter- mination was reached only a short time before the cul- mination of the difficulty between Pope Boniface and the King of France, which eventually resulted in what has been called the outrage of Anagni and the subse- quent death of the Pope within a short time. It has usually been thought, then, that in spite of certain ex- tant Papal documents creating the University of the City of Rome, this university had not been organized before Pope Boniface’s death, and as his successor did not take his seat at Rome, but at Avignon, it has usually been assumed that the University of the City came into existence at most only in an abortive form. Denifle, whose History of the Universities of the Middle Ages is looked upon as the best authority in such matters, however, insists that a complete university of the City of Rome did come into existence as a result of Boniface’s decree. All during the time when the Popes were at Avignon this university continued to exist, and in spite of the fact that at one time, as a consequence of a great earthquake followed by a pestilence, and then serious political troubles because of the absence of the Popes, Rome had only something less than ten thousand inhabi- tants, the university continued its work. Denifle calls attention to the fact that there are letters of Pope John which show that he paid out of the Papal revenues

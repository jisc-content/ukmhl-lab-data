297 EXPERIMENTAL METHOD tian speaking of such matters as being according to the Christian Scriptures, should be heard by an unbeliever talking such nonsense that the unbeliever, perceiving him to be as wide from the mark as east from west, can hardly restrain himself from'laughing.” It is the opinions of such men as Augustine and Albert that must be taken as representing the real attitude of theologians and churchmen toward science, and not those of lesser men, whose zeal, as is ever true of the minor adherents of any cause, always is prone to carry them into unfor- tunate excesses. Albert the Great was indeed a thoroughgoing experi- mentalist in the best modern sense of the term. He says in the second book of his treatise On Minerals (De Mineralibus): ‘ ‘ The aim of natural science is not simply to accept the statements of others, that is, what is nar- rated by people, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature for themselves. ” When we take this expression in connection with the other, that ‘ ‘ we must endeavor to find out what nature can naturally bring to pass,” the complete foundation of experimentalism is laid. Albert held this principle not only in theory, but applied it in practice. It is often said that the scholastic philosophers, and notably Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, almost idolatrously worshipped at the shrine of Aristotle, and were ready to accept anything that this great Greek philosopher had taught. We have already quoted Roger Bacon’s request to the Pope to forbid the study of the Stagirite. It is interesting to find in this regard, that while Albert declared that in questions of natural science he would prefer to follow Aristotle to St. Augustine—a declaration which may seem surprising to many people

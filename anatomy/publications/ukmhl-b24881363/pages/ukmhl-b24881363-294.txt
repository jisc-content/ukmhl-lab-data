THE POPES AND SCIENCE 274 though in most places with the affirmation of a standing rule, that all those complaining of illness were to be re- ceived into the hospital for at least one day, until their cases could be examined with sufficient care to decide how much of reality and how much of simulation there might be in their pretended symptoms. The tramp, of course, has always been in the world, and probably al- ways will be, and so what are called the sturdy va- grants (validi vagrantes) received the special attention of those wishing to eliminate hospital abuses, and vari- ous decrees were made in order to prevent them from re- ceiving sustenance from the hospitals, or in any other way abusing the privileges of these charitable institutions. A hospital movement, quite distinct from that of In- nocent III., which attracted so much attention shortly after the general hospital became common as to deserve particular consideration, was the erection of the lepro- series or special institutions for the care of lepers. Leprosy had become quite common in Europe during the Middle Ages, and the continued contact of the West with the East during the crusades had brought about a notable increase of the disease. It is not definitely known how much of what was called leprosy at that time, really belonged to the specific disease now known as lepra. There is no doubt that many affections, which have since come to be considered as quite harmless and non-contagious, were included under the designation leprosy by the populace and even physicians incapable as yet of making a proper differential diagnosis. Prob- ably severe cases of eczema and other chronic skin dis- eases, especially when complicated by the results of wrongly directed treatment or of lack of cleansing, were not infrequently pronounced to be true leprosy.

SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF CHEMISTRY 137 first of the chemists, left twenty-three treatises, some of them good-sized books, on various subjects in chemistry.1 It does not look, then, as though chemistry was much neglected during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. One step more in the history remains to be taken, which brings us down to a man who is more familiar to modern physicians—Paracelsus. Paracelsus received his education just at the beginningof the sixteenth cen- tury, before the Reformation began. He was not a man, as those who know his character will thoroughly appreciate, to confess that he had received much assist ance from others. He does mention, however, that he was helped in his chemical studies by the Abbot Trit- hemius, of Spanheim; by Bishop Scheit, of Stettbach; by Bishop Erhardt, of Lavanthol; by Bishop Nicholas, of Hippon ; and by Bishop Matthew Schacht. We have been able to follow, then, the development of chemistry during the fourteenth and fifteenth centu- ries down to the time of the Reformation, and find no- where any lessening of the ardor for chemical studies, though most of the great names in the science continue to be, as they were before the decree was issued, those of distinguished ecclesiastics. John’s decree, then, was neither intended to hamper the development of chem- istry, nor did it accidentally prevent those who were most closely in touch with the ecclesiastical authorities from pursuing their studies. Those, of course, who knew anything of the character of the author, would not expect it to interfere with the true progress of science. As we shall see in the next chapter, Pope John XXII. was really one of the most liberal patrons ot education and of science in history. 1 For a brief sketch of his Press.

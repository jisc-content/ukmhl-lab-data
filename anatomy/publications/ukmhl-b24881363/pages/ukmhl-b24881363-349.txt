Whatever truth there may be in this, of one thing we are certain, that before his death Bacon deeply regretted some of his expressions and theories, and did not hesitate to confess humbly that he was sorry to have even seemed to hint at supposed science contrary to religious truth. Of course, it may well be said, even after all these communities of interest between the medieval and the modern teaching of the general principles of science have been pointed out, that the universities of the Middle Ages did not present the subjects under discussion in a practical way, and their teaching was not likely to lead to directly beneficial results in applied science. It might well be responded to this, that it is not the function of a university to teach applications of science, but only the great principles, the broad generalizations that underlie scientific thinking, leaving details to be filled in in what- ever form of practical work the man may take up. Very few of those, however, who talk about the purely specu- lative character of medieval teaching, have manifestly ever made it their business to know anything about the ac- tual facts of old-timeuniversity teaching bydefinite knowl- edge, but have rather allowed themselves to be guided by speculation and by inadequate second-hand author- ities, whose dicta they have never taken the trouble to substantiate by a glance at contemporary authorities on medieval matters, much less by reading the old scholas- tics themselves.

122 THE POPES AND SCIENCE and Historical Journal, I answered these assertions of Dr. Cruikshank, pointing out that the Papal document which he mentioned had no such purport as he declared, and that the history of chemistry or alchemy presented no such break as his assertions would demand. Dr. Cruikshank immediately appealed by letter to his au- thority on the subject, whose words, in the History of the Warfare of Theology with Science in Christendom, though I did not realize it at the time, he had repeated almost literally. In his chapter on From Magic to Chem- istry and Physics, Dr. Andrew D. White says : “ In 1317, Pope John XXII. issued his bull Spondent pariter, lev- elled at the alchemists, but really dealing a terrible blow at the beginning of chemical science. He therefore called on all rulers, secular and ecclesiastical, to hunt down the miscreants who thus afflicted the faithful, and he especially increased the power of inquisitors in vari- ous parts of Europe for this purpose.” It will be seen that, as I have said, Dr. Cruikshank’s words are al- most a verbatim quotation from this paragraph. It is true that he has strengthened the expressions quite a little and added some trimmings of his own, still I sup- pose his expressions could be justified if those of Presi- dent White had a foundation in fact. A little compari- son of the two sets of phrases will show how a history lie grows as it passes from pen to pen. Cvescit eundo like rumor, it increases in size as it goes. In defense of this passage in the History of the War- fare of Science with Theology in Christendom, Dr. White wrote a letter of reply to Dr. Cruikshank, which was in- corporated into Dr. Cruikshank’s response to my article in the Medical Library and Historical Journal. I pre- sume that this was done with Dr. White’s permission.

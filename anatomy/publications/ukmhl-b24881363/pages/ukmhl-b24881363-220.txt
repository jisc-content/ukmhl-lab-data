200 THE POPES AND SCIENCE cine that are utterly at variance with the plain facta of history. Once more, as in the case of the supposed failure of surgery to develop during the Middle Ages, it is a deduction that has been made from certain supposed principles, and not an induction from the actual facts as we know them. Such historians would be the first to emphasize the narrowness of the schoolmen for their supposed dependence on deduction, but what they have to say on medical history is entirely deductive, and un- fortunately from premises that will not stand in the presence of the story of the wonderful rise and develop- ment of medical science and medical education, mainly under the patronage of ecclesiastics, in the Middle Ages. The argument may be stated formally with perfect fairness as follows : When men believe in miracles they cannot build up scientific medicine and surgery; but men believed in miracles in the Middle Ages, therefore they did not build up scientific medicine and surgery. When stated thus baldly in formal scholastic form, the argu- ment loses most of the glamor that has been thrown around it. This is one of the advantages of the old scholastic methodâ€”it strips argument to its naked signif- icance. Logic asserts herself and rhetoric loses its force. With regard to the major premise that when men be- lieve in miracles they will not successfully pursue in- vestigations in the medical science, there are two an- swers. One of these concerns the actual attitude of mind towards scientific medicine of men who believe in miracles, for we have such men still with us, and have always had them all during the past seven centuries. The other portion of the answer concerns what men who were distinguished scientific investigators thought'of

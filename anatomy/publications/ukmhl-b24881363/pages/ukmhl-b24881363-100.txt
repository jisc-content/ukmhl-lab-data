80 THE POPES AND SCIENCE to say of them hereafter), taught surgery from a very practical standpoint in Paris, and illustrated his teach- ings by means of dissections. Lanfranc was succeeded in Paris by Mondeville, whose name is also associated with the practice of dissection by most historians of medicine, and whose teaching was of such a practical character that there can be no doubt that he must have employed this valuable adjunct in his surgical training of students. In general, however, the records of dissecting work and of anatomical development are not near so satisfactory at Paris as in the Italian universities. As is the case in our own day and has always been true, universities were inclined to specialties in the Middle Ages, and the specialty of Paris was Philosophy and Theology. This was choice, however, not compulsion, any more than similar conditions in our own time. The medical school continued to be in spite of this one of the best in the world, though it was not famous for its original work, except in surgery, which is, however, the subject most nearly related to anatomy and the one whose develop- ment would seem necessarily to demand attention to anatomy. With the Renaissance, which is usually said to begin after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and the con- sequent dispersion of Greek scholars throughout Italy, a new spirit entered into anatomy as into every other de- partment of intellectual life at this time. The reason for it is not easy to explain. Perhaps the spread of Greek texts with regard to medicine inspired students and teachers to try out their problems for themselves, and so a new impetus was given to anatomical investiga- tion. Whatever it was that caused it, the new move- ment came unhampered by the Church, and Italy con-

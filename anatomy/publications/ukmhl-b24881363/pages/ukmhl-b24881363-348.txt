THE POPES AND SCIENCE 328 came about. The Franciscans of the rigid observance of those early times took vows of the severest poverty. There had been some relaxation of the rule, however, and certain abuses crept in. The consequence was the re-assertion after a time of the original rule of abso- lute poverty in all its stringency. It was Friar Bacon himself who had chosen this mode of life and had taken the vows of poverty. Paper was a very dear commod- ity, if indeed it was invented early enough in the cen- tury for him to have used it. Vellum was even more expensive.

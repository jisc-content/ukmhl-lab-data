THE POPES AND SCIENCE 18 when his book was published it was dedicated to a Pope. Copernicus himself was a faithful churchman all his life, came near being made a bishop once, and kept the dio- cese in which he lived, and in which his personal friend was bishop, in the fold of the Church in spite of Luther and the religious revolt all around it in Germany. One of the great scientists of the seventeenth century whose name is stamped deeply on the history of science, Father Kircher, the Jesuit, was invited to Rome the very year after Galileo’s condemnation, and for thirty years con- tinued to experiment and write in all branches of science, not only with the approbation of his own order, the Jesuits, which helped him in every way by the collection of specimens for his museum, but also with the hearty good will of many cardinals who were his personal friends, and with the constant patronage of the Popes, whose generous liberality enabled him to make Rome the greatest centre of scientific interest during this cen- tury. At this time and during the preceding century the Roman University had the greatest medical school in the world. The names of its professors during the preced- ing century need only be mentioned in order to empha- size this. They include such distinguished men as Eus- tachius and Varolius, whose names are forever enshrined in the history of anatomy; Columbus, who discovered and described the lesser or pulmonary circulation half a century before Harvey’s publication with regard to the general circulation ; Csesalpinus, to whom the Ital- ians attribute the discovery of the greater circulation before Harvey.

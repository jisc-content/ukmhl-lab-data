88 THE POPES AND SCIENCE lius of Padua, the Venetian Senate sought to show the Vatican that it would yield none of its rights to clerical control. This very fact—that Venice refused to be bound with regard to anatomical investigation by an order from the Vatican—seems to be entirely in the line with all the other facts in the case, which show that the Roman court had committed itself, most unfortunately, against the main means of progress in anatomy and medicine.’ ’ Here then is the answer that a modern historian and educator makes to all the representations with re- gard to the development of anatomy and the practice of dissection during the Middle Ages. If the practice of dissection was permitted it was in spite of the Popes. The fact that there were a dozen of medical schools in Italy at which dissection was carried on is ignored. The great anatomists of the fourteenth and fifteenth cen- turies simply did not exist—Dr. White knows nothing about them. There must be no admission that the Popes permitted dissection or any other form of science. Dr. White makes his last stand by a really marvelous tour d’esprit. It was Venice defying the Vatican that per- mitted dissection. This, he supposes, may help him, for anatomy did develop very wonderfully at Padua when it was Venetian territory. But, as pointed out by Roth, dissection was practiced very successfully, and the an- atomical tradition established at Padua, before it came under the dominion of Venice. At all the other impor- tant cities of Italy dissection was carried on. We have given some of the evidence for Verona, for Pisa, for Naples, for Bologna, for Florence, and, be it remem- bered, even for Rome. Padua was the rival of Bologna in anatomy only for a comparatively short time. Bologna

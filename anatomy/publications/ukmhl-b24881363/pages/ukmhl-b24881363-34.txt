14 THE POPES AND SCIENCE believe that the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were so backward in medicine and surgery that they practi- cally have no history in these departments, or so little as not to be worth talking about. The simple facts show us that this is one of three or four great periods in hu- man history in which there was the most wonderful de- velopment of medicine and surgery. As we shall see in the course of this book, there was no bull or any other document issued by the Popes for- bidding dissection or hampering the development of anatomy in any way. As a matter of fact, the ecclesi- astics, instead of being behind their age in liberality of spirit with regard to the use of the human body after death for anatomical purposes, were always ahead of it. There has always existed a popular horror of dissection, and this has manifested itself from the earliest times in history down to and within the last half century, in re- fusal to enact such secular legislation as would properly provide for the practice of dissection. This was as true in the United States until within the memory of men still alive as it had always been hitherto in European history.

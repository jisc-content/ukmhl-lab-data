CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE 309 only in the possibility, but in the actual occurrence of the transmutation of metals. Observations made with re- gard to radium have revolutionized all the scientific thinking in this matter. Radium has apparently been demonstrated changing into helium, and so there is a transmutation of metals. On the strength of this and certain other recently investigated physical phenomena, there is a definite tendency in the minds of many serious students of physics and chemistry to consider that other metals possibly change into one another, and that all that is needed is careful observation to discover it, for this change is supposed to be going on around us all the time. Not very long since, a professor of physical science at an important American university suggested that it would be extremely interesting to take a large specimen of lead ore, say several tons, and having removed from it carefully all traces of silver that might be contained in it, put it away for twenty years, and then see whether any further traces of silver could be found. The idea that possibly lead occasionally changes into silver by some slow chemical process is evidently deep-seated in his mind. It would remind one of Newton’s expression some two centuries ago, that he had seen copper and gold ores occurring together in specimens, and that he looked upon this as evidence that copper in the course of time changes into gold. Certain it is that lead ores con- stantly occur in connection with silver, or at least that silver is found wherever lead is; that a corresponding re- lationship between gold and copper has also been noted ; and that Newton’s idea was not near so absurd, in the light of what we now know, or still more, what we sur- mise on good scientific grounds, as the nineteenth cen- tury scientists would have had us believe.

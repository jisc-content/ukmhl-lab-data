Could anything well be more preposterous. And this is history ! Nay, it is even the history of science. When I called attention to the fact that this decretal contained none of the things it was said to, and pub- lished the text of it, Dr. White very calmly replied: “ Dr. Walsh has indeed correctly printed it, and I notice no flaw in his translation. ’ ’ Instead of conceding, how- ever, that he had been mistaken, he seemed to consider it quite sufficient to add, ‘ ‘ I have followed what I found to be the unanimous opinion of the standard historians of chemistry.” He did not mention any of the histo- rians, however. I asked him by letter to name some of the standard historians of chemistry who made this declaration, but though I received a courteous reply, it contained no names, and, indeed, avoided the question m—IIIHW

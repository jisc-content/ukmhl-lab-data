ANATOMY TO THE RENAISSANCE 86 ately and clear-sightedly as any pathologist in the spacious time of Baillie, Bright and Addison. Virchow, in his address at Rome, said Morgagni was the first pathological anatomist who, instead of asking What is disease ? asked Where is it ? But Benivieni asked this question plainly before Mor- gagni: “Not only,” says he,“ must we observe the disease, but also with more diligence search out the seat of it.” The precept is so important, I will quote the original words: “ Oportet igitur medicum non solum morbum cognoscere, sed et locum in quo fit, diligentius perscrutari. ’ ’ Among the pathological reports are morbus coxae (two cases); biliary calculus (two cases); abscess of the me- sentery, thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels; stenosis of the intestine ; some remarkable cardiac cases, several of “polypus” (clot, which was a will-of-the-wisp to the elder pathologists); scirrhus of the pylorus, and proba- bly another case in the colon; ruptured bowel (two cases); caries of ribs with exposure of the heart. He gives a good description of senile gangrene which even Pare did not discriminate. He seems to have had re- markable success in obtaining necropsies; concerning one fatal case he says plaintively, ‘ ‘ Sed nescio qua su- perstitione versi negantibus cognatis,” etc. Of another he says, “cadavere publicse utilitatis gratia inciso ” (the case of cancer of the stomach). With this admirable and original leader, Italian medicine of the fifteenth century closes gloriously, to slumber for some fifty years, till the dayspring of the new learning. Of his work Malpighi says, and apparently with truth, “ up to now it is the only work in pathology which owes nothing to anyone.”

Anyone 1 who was fostering this kind of education in medicine was advancing the cause of one of the applied sciences in a very wonderful way. If we add that, at this same time the proper use of opium in medicine was a feature of medical teaching which had just been introduced by a Papal physician, while a form of anaesthesia was being practically devel- oped and very generally employed, the question will be why we, in the twentieth century, do not know ever so much more than we actually do, rather than why these earnest students of the thirteenth century knew so little, which is the absurd thought that most authorities in education seem to entertain at the present time with regard to our forbears of early university history. The student of medicine during the thirteenth century had to devote himself very nearly to the same department of science as those which occupy his col- leagues of the present century. The prospectus of a medical school of the time would announce very probably some such program of studies as this. Besides learning something of astrology (the astronomy of the day) the student would be expected to know much about climate and its influence on disease, and about soil in its relation to pathology (these were supposed to be fruitful causes of disease). Certain min- erals, among them very probably antimony, were begin- nings be used in medical practice, and so mineralogy was a special subject of study. Of plants they were expected to know in a general way much more than the modern

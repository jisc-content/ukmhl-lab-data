CHURCH AND MENTALLY AFFLICTED 385 affect brain cells, and thus bring about communications, as Sir William Crookes explains the curious phenomena in this line that occur between human beings. Such an explanation may easily be dismissed as highly imag- inative and altogether theoretic. As a student of psy- chology now for many years, it has appealed to me, however, as the only possible hypothesis that gives any plausible explanation of the curious conversions which so inevitably result from sympathetic attempts at inves- tigation of the possibility of spirit interference in mun- dane affairs. How far this persuasion of spiritual interference in ordinary human affairs has gone, will not be realized except by those who are familiar with some of the literature which has been made in the last twenty years on the subject of psychical research. Not long since, a distinguished European professor of physical science went so far as to warn people of the dangers there might be in dismissing the opinion that other intelli- gences than those of men could interfere for the abro- gation of certain natural laws. This may be scoffed at as the height of credulity, and may be received in sceptical mood by those who refuse to look into such matters, because they know a priori that they cannot be true!

It is to be remarked that it was not ecclesiastics of whom he was talking" at this time, but professors of science at the University of

107 THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY knowledge of form and tissue to function, and came to be looked upon as the leading medical investigator of the world. It is apparently sometimes not realized, how- ever, that Vesalius was no mere laboratory or dissecting room investigator. After the publication of his great work on anatomy he set himself seriously to the applica- tion of what he had discovered to practical medicine and surgery. He was an intensely practical man. As a consequence, it was not long before consultations began to pour in on him, and he came to be considered as one of the greatest medical practitioners of his time.

This is a side of his character that many of his modern biographers have missed. Even Sir Michael Foster, whose knowledge of the his- tory of medicine, and especially of physiology, makes one hesitate to disagree with him, seems not to have appreciated Vesalius’s interest in practical medicine. A laboratory man himself, he was apparently not able to appreciate why Vesalius should have given up his scien- tific research in Italy to accept the post of Royal Phy- sician to the Emperor Charles ’V. Professor Foster thinks it necessary, then, to find some other reason than the temptation of the import- ance of the position to account for Vesalius’s acceptance of it. . He concludes that it was because of discourage- ment m his purely scientific studies as a consequence of the oppositmn of the Galenists. Opposition on the part of the old conservative school of medicine there was and some of it was rather serious. This was not enough’ however, to have discouraged Vesalius. Professor Fos- ter goes so far as to wax almost sentimental over the

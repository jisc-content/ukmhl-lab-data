UNIVERSITY MAN AND SCIENCE 345 how earnest were these medieval burghers for the edu- cation of their children. Dante had the advantage of this, and in addition, of the training at two or three of the universities at least of Italy, besides spending some time at Paris, and probably a visit at least to Oxford. Lest it should be thought that perhaps Brother Aza- rias gave too favorable an estimate in his account of the schools in Florence, though he quotes as his authority Villani, and other authorities are readily available, it seems worth while to give a very interesting reference to this subject of education in one of the notes in Prince Kropotkin’s chapter on Mutual Aid in the Medieval City, from his book Mutual Aid a Factor in Evolution, a work that we have placed under contribution a number of times already in this attempt to picture medieval condi- tions as they were in reality, and not in the foolish imaginings of outworn traditions. Kropotkin’s studies in what the free cities accomplished by the union of the guilds for every fraternal purpose, and the coordination of their citizens for every detail of the commonweal, has made him realize that common or public school educa- tion was an important feature of medieval free city life, and strange as that fact may appear to many modern minds, that such public school education occupied at least as prominent a position as it does with us in our own time. In the quotation from him it will be seen that he considers that Florence was not alone in this matter, and he ventures to place Nuremberg on a level with her. Doubtless other German cities, as certainly other Italian cities, provided similar facilities for general education. Kropotkin says: “In 1336 it (Florence) had 8,000 to 1,10,000 boys and girls in its primary schools, 1,000 to

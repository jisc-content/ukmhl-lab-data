SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF CHEMISTRY 129 ^ There is another document of John XXII., the bull Super Rlius Specula, that has been sometimes quoted, or rather misquoted, and which indeed at first I was in- clined to think was the bull referred to by Dr. Cruik- shank. This second Papal document, however, was not issued until 1326. It is concerned entirely with the practice of magic.

This is indeed a very

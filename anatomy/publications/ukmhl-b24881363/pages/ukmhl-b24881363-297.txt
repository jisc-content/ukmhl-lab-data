THE FOUNDATION OF CITY HOSPITALS 277 disappearance has come mainly in the last twenty-five years. It is now known to be a contagious disease, and indeed, as Oliver Wendell Holmes pointed out over half a century ago, may readily be carried from place to place by the physician in attendance. It does not al- ways manifest itself as erysipelas when thus carried, however, and the merit of Dr. Holmesâ€™s work was in pointing out the fact that physicians who attended pa- tients suffering from erysipelas and then waited on ob- stetrical cases, were especially likely to carry the affec- tion, which manifested itself as puerperal fever. A number of cases of this kind were reported and dis- cussed by him, and there is no doubt that his warning served to save many precious lives. Of course nothing of this was known in the thirteenth century; yet the encouragement given to this religious order which devoted itself practically exclusively to the care in special hospitals of erysipelas, must have had no little effect in bringing about a limitation of the spread of the disease. In such hospitals patients were not likely to come in contact with many persons, and consequently the contagion-radius of the disease was limited. In our own time, immediate segregation of cases when discovered has practically eradicated it, so that many a young physician, even though ten years in practice, has never seen a case of it. It was so common during the Civil War and for half a century before that here in America, that there were frequent epidemics of it in hospitals, and it was generally recognized that the disease was so contagious, that when it once gained a foothold in a hospital ward nearly every patient suffer- ing from an open wound was likely to be affected by it. It is interesting then to learn that these people of the

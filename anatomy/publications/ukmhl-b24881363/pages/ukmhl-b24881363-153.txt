SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF CHEMISTRY 133 The French Grande Encyclopedie does not mention it, nor does a German encyclopedia, also consulted. Even the Encyclopedia Britannica, in its article on alchemy, makes no mention of the prohibition of alchemy by Pope John XXII., and when the Encyclopedia Britannica does noi mention any scandal with regard to the Popes, then the scandal in question must have an extremely slight or no foundation. Of course this is what might be expected. Anyone who reads the Papal decree can see at once that it has nothing to do with, or say about, chemistry or chemical investigation. Since, however, an aspersion has been cast upon the progress of chemistry during the Middle Ages,, and since it will surely be thought by many people that, if chemistry did not happen to interest mankind at that time, it must have been because the Pope was opposed to it (for such seems to be the curious chain of reasoning of certain scholars), it has seemed well to re- view briefly the story of chemistry during the thir- teenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. More will be said about it in the chapter on Science at the Medie- val Universities, and here the only idea is to bring out he fact that men were interested in what we now call chemical problems; that whatever interest they had was absolutely unhampered by ecclesiastical opposition • thaL indeed the very men who did the best work in this me and th^r work is by no means without significance ™ ^ r ll Y °f SC1GnCe’ Were a11 cler^en i and that 0at of them were m high favor with the Popes and some of them have since received the honor of being canonized as saints. ^ Take for a moment the example of the great English medieval scientist who wrote near the end of the thir-

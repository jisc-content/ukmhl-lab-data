The next six years were spent in teaching at Padua, Bologna and Pisa, and in fruitful investigation. Every opportunity to make dissections was gladly seized, and Vesalius’s influence enabled him to obtain a large amount of excellent anatomical material. He began at once the preparations for the publication of an important work on the anatomy of the human body. This was published in 1543 at Basel, at a time when its author was not yet thirty years of age. It is one of the classics of anatomi- cal literature. Even at the present day it is often con- sulted by those who wish to see the illustrative details of Vesalius’s wonderful dissections as given in the mag- nificent plates that the work contains. It has become one of the most precious of medical books, and is eagerly sought for by collectors. For ten years more Vesalius devoted himself to his favorite studies in anatomy and physiology, for it must not be forgotten that he was constantly applying his *

CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE 307 for they knew many things. They erred because they did not know, and they could not know the conditions of the problems which, as they emerged from the cauldron of war and from the wreck of letters and science, they were nevertheless bound to attack, if civil societies worthy of the name were to be constructed. ’ ’ We are very prone to think that the interests of the men of the Middle Ages were very different to our own, and that they had not the slightest inkling of what were to be the interests of the future centuries. Ordinarily students of science, for instance, would be sure to think that electricity and magnetism, interest in which is supposed to be a thing of comparatively recent years, or at most of the last two centuries, would not be mentioned at all in the thirteenth century. Such an idea is not only absolutely false to the history of science as we know it, but is utterly unjust to the powers of observa- tion of men who have always noted, and almost neces- sarily tried to investigate, the phenomena which are now grouped under these sciences. Perhaps no better idea of the intense interest of this first century of uni- versity life in natural phenomena can be obtained, than will be gleaned at once from the following short para- graph, in which Brother Potamian, of Manhattan Col- lege, in his brief, striking introduction to the letter of Petrus Peregrinus describing the first conception of a dynamo, condenses the references to magnetic manifes- tions that are found in the literature of the time.1 Most of the writers he mentions were not scientists in the ordinary sense of the word, but were literary men ; and the fact that these references occur, shows very clearly that there must have been widespread interest in such scientific phenomena, since they had attracted the 1 The Letter of Petrus Peregrinus, N.

71 ANATOMY TO THE RENAISSANCE part of the fourteenth century, in his chapter on Dissec- tion Before Vesalius’s Time. Roth’s work is well known and is frequently referred to in Dr. White’s History of the Warfare of Science with Theology. There can be no question, then, but that in taking what Roth has to say I shall be quoting from a work with regard to which there can be no hint even of partiality.

Some of the material that Roth has made use of has already been referred to in the preceding chapter, but it has seemed proper to repeat it here because this gives a connected account from a definite authority in the his- tory of medicine, and especially of anatomy, with regard to the century immediately following the promulgation of Boniface’s bull. Besides, it gives an opportunity for such comments on various features of the history of anatomy, as he details it, as will bring out the significance of his remarks.

The bull was never thought of in that sense at all. It does not refer to anatomy or dissection and it never had

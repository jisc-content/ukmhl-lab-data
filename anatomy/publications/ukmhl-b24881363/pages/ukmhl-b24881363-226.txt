THE POPES AND SCIENCE 206 with a European reputation-Linacre-who, three cen- tuiies later, after having been the royal physician for many years to King Henry VIII., became a clergyman. It is interesting to realize that, early in history as Rich- ard s life occurs, some works attributed to him contain definite information with regard to anatomy. Most of this, it is true, is taken from Hippocrates, Galen, and the Arabs, but some of it seems to be the result of his own personal experience, on the living, if not on the dead. After Richard, the next of the physicians to the Popes .who has an important place in the history of medicine is the famous Thaddeus Alderotti, who lived for more than eighty years during the thirteenth century. He has the added interest for this generation of having been a self- made man, for he was the son of very poor parents of the lowest rank. Up to his thirtieth year he remained without any special education. He made his living, it is said, by selling candles. Having acquired a little com- petency, at the age of thirty he began with great zeal the study of philosophy and of medicine, two sciences which in the old days were supposed to go very well to- gether, though, unfortunately, they are often rigidly separated from each other in later times. Fifteen years after he began the study of medicine we hear of him as a medical teacher, and then ten years later he began to be famous as a writer on all sorts of medical topics. He became the physician of Pope Honorius IV., himself one of the most liberal and broadly educated of men, and as the result of the confidence awakened by his oc- cupancy of this honorable position, he secured an im- mense success in practice and made an enormous for- tune. Alderottiâ€™s work represents what is best in medi- cine for the whole of the thirteenth century.

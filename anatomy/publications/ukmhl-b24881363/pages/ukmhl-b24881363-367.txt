UNIVERSITY MAN AND SCIENCE 347 x l no lack of good authorities, however, who have made deep studies in Dante, to bring out for us the complete import of all the references to the science of his time, which Dante was tempted to make. We have perhaps been prone to think, in English-speaking countries, that no poets have ever kept more thoroughly in touch with the progress of science, or at least have ever used refer- ences to scientific details with more accuracy, than some of our own nineteenth century poets. A little study of the first great poet of modern times, in whom Carlyle said ‘‘ten silent centuries found a voice,” though Dante by no means stands alone in the century, but is the cul- mination of a series of great poets, will show that he probably must be considered as taking the palm even from our most modern of poets in this respect. If the expressions in text-books of the history of education are to be accepted as evidence of the thoughts of educators with regard to the details of education in Dante’s time, even a brief sketch of Dante’s scientific knowledge will be a supreme surprise to them. As will be at once appreciated, Dante was not a spe- cialist in science, but used the knowledge of science cur- rent in his day in order to drive home his thoughts by means of figures. It is surprising, however, what a marvelous display of scientific knowledge, entirely with- out pedantry, which anyone who knows his supreme compression of style will realize to be the fault Dante is least liable to, was thus made by this educated literary man of the thirteenth century. Dr. L. Oscar Kuhns, Professor in Wesleyan Universi y, has in his little book The Treatment of Nature in Dante’s Divina Commedia, suggested a comparison between Dante and Goethe.1 1 The Treatment of Nature in Dante’s Divina Commedia, by L Oscar Kuhns Professor in Wesleyan University, Middletown USA FrlwnrH a u t 1 ' and New York, 1897.

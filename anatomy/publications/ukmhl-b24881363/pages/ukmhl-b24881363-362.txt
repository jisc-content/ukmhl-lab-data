In our time, architects are likely to know more about certain forms of physical science than most other people, and due allowance would have to be made for this in Dante’s case. It will be found, though, as we discuss his erudition, that the sciences in which he was particularly interested-astronomy and various phases of biology with physical geography— were not those which appeal especially to an architect, and certainly have no relation to his occupation.

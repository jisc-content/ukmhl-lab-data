37 SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION The first dissection of which we have definite record, Roth tells us in his life of Vesalius, was a so-called pri- vate anatomy or dissection made for medico-legal pur- poses. Its date is the year 1302, within two years after the bull. A nobleman had died and there was a sus- picion that he had been poisoned. The judge ordered that an autopsy be made in order to determine this ques- tion. Unfortunately we do not know what the decision of the doctors in .the case was. We know only that the case was referred to them. Now it seems very clear that if this had not been a common practice before, the court would not have adopted this measure, apparently as a matter of judicial routine, as seems to have been the case in this instance. Had it been the first time that it was done instead of having the record of the trans- action preserved only by chance, any mention of it at all would have appeared so striking to the narrator, that he would have been careful to tell the whole story, and especially the decision reached in the matter. After this, evidence of dissection accumulates rapidly. During the second decade of the century Mondino, the first writer on anatomy, was working at Bologna. We have the records of his having made some dissections in connection with his university teaching there, and event- ually he published a text-book on dissection which be- came the guide for dissectors for the next two centuries. Within five years after this we have a story of students being haled to court for body-snatching for anatomical purposes, and about this time there was, according to Rashdall in his History of the Universities, a statute of the University of Bologna which required the teacher in anatomy to dissect a body, if the students brought it to him. More than ten years earlier than this, that is,

PAPAL PHYSICIANS 217 sician first to the Emperor Charles V. and then to his son Philip II., whom many would declare to be as Catholic as the Popes themselves in religious tendencies. After Eustachius came Varolius, whose name is en- graved in the history of medicine because the Pons Va- rolii or bridge of Varolius, an important structure in the brain now often simply called the pons, was named after him. To Varolius we owe one of the earliest detailed descriptions of the anatomy of the brain. He was the Papal Physician to Gregory XIII., who will be remem- bered as the Pope under whom the reform of the calendar was made by the great Jesuit mathematician and astron- omer, Father Clavius. Pope Gregory’s enlightened pat- ronage of medicine in the person of Varolius will be bet- ter appreciated if we add that he was chosen as Papal Physician when he was not yet thirty years of age, though he had already given abundant evidence of his talent for original investigation in anatomy. He died at the early age of thirty-two, but not until after he had accomplished a life’s work sufficient to give him an en- during place in the history of anatomy. After Varolius as Papal Physician came Piccolomini and then Caesalpi- nus, whom the Italians hail as the discoverer of the cir- culation of the blood before Harvey, and of whom we shall have much to say in the next chapter. Piccolomini was not as great an original thinker and worker as many of his predecessors and successors, but he was a man whose prestige in medicine was scarcely less than theirs. That this same liberal patronage of distinguished phy- sicians was continued in the next century may be real- ized from the fact that Malpighi, the great founder of comparative anatomy, became one of the Papal Physi- cians.

1908. DEDICATION TO POPE PIUS X. Your Holiness : It is with very great pleasure that I avail myself of the permission obtained for me by my good friend Archbishop Farley, of New York, to dedicate this volume to Your Holiness. Four years ago, when I had the privilege of an audience, Your Holiness spoke very earnestly of the Apostolate of the press and of the lecture platform. The words impressed me profoundly and have often recurred to my mind. They led me to devote much of my time during these years to the study and publication of the records of the Papal rela- tions to science and education. I am now very glad to be able to lay at the feet of Your Holiness a volume which sets the attitude of the Popes to Science in an entirely different light from that in which it is usually placed by English-speaking historians at least. I am sorry that the cause of the Church and of the Popes has not fallen to better hands. I willingly assume all the responsibility for any misstatements that may have crept into the treatment for the first time of so large a subject, and only hope that the truth, which I have found so different from what I had been led to believe, may redound to the glory of Holy Mother Church and the universal appreciation of the beneficent mission of the Vicar of Christ upon earth. This shall not be the last volume of this kind, God willing, and I hope always to remain, Your Holiness’ humble and obedient servant, James J. Walsh. Our Lady’s Day,

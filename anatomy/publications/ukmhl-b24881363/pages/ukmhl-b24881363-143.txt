SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF CHEMISTRY 123 In this letter he admitted that Pope John’s decretal had ' no such significance as he originally claimed for it, but he still maintained his previous opinion, that this de- cretal, like Boniface’s bull for anatomy, had actually prevented, or at least greatly hampered the study of chemistry. To this I replied with a brief story of chemistry in the fourteenth century, and though that article was published more than a year ago, no admis- sion has been made and nothing further has been pub- lished on the subject. The material of the reply to Dr. White, to which as yet there has been no answer, is com- prised in this chapter. As I have already hinted, the most surprising thing about this citation of a Papal decree forbidding chem- istry, is that it proves on investigation to be founded on just exactly the same sort of misinterpretation of a Papal document as happened with regard to anatomy. I The bull of Pope Boniface VIII. forbidding the boiling 1 of bodies and their dismemberment for burial in distant lands, did nothing to hinder the progress of anatomy, had no reference to any preparations required for dis- section, and was not misinterpreted in any such sense until the nineteenth century, and then only for the pur- pose of discrediting the Popes and their relations to sci- ence. Pope Boniface’s bull, far from being harmful in any way to education or to the people, was really bene- ficial, and constituted an excellent sanitary regulation which doubtless prevented, on a number of occasions, the carriage of disease from place to place. The decree of Pope John XXII., which has been falsely claimed to forbid chemistry, was another example of Papal care for Christendom, and not at all the obscur- antist document it has been so loudly proclaimed.

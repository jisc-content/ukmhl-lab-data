98 THE POPES AND SCIENCE eral years there could be reasonably expected to know all that there was to be known in the rising sciences of anat- omy and physiology ; at the same time there was a very general impression, quite justified by the results ob- served, that those who did their post-graduate work in Italy were nearly always sure to make discoveries that would add to the prestige of their universities later, and that would be a stimulus to students and to the other teachers around them such as could be provided in no other way. If read in the proper spirit, the history of the universities of those times is quite like our own, only for influence, the name of Italy must always be substi- tuted for that of Germany. Yet Italy, if we were to believe some of the writers on the history of education and science, was at this time laboring under the incubus of ecclesiastical intolerance with regard to anatomy and an almost complete suppression of opportunities for dis- section. Those who write thus know nothing at all of the actual facts of the history of science, or else they are blinding themselves for some reason to the real situ- ation. Fortunately students of the facts of history, especially those who have devoted any serious attention to the his- tory of medicine, make no such mistake. For them it is perfectly clear that there was a wonderful development in anatomy which took place down in Italy, beginning about the middle of the fifteenth century or even earlier, and which led to the provision of such opportunities for dis- section and original research in medicine, that students from all over the world were attracted there. For in- stance, Professor Clifford Allbutt, in the address on the Historical Relations of Medicine and Surgery to the end of the Sixteenth Century, already quoted, has a passage

THE POPES AND SCIENCE 100 utterly unfounded is the opinion that there was opposi- tion between religion, or theology and science, and above all medical science, at this time. On the other hand, it will demonstrate that the educational factors at work in Vesalius’s time were not different from those of the pre- ceding century, nor indeed from those that had existed for two or three centuries before his time ; and though his magnificent original research introduced the new initiative which always comes after a genius has left his mark upon a scientific department, the spirit in which science was pursued after his time did not differ essen- tially from that which had prevailed before.

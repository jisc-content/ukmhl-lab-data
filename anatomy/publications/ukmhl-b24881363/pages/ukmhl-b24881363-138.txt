THE POPES AND SCIENCE 118 in our day in any civilized country. Professor Foster, of the University of Cambridge in England, following the lead of President White in this matter, blames the Inquisition for instituting the prosecution. If this were true, no more proof would be needed that the Inquisi- tion was a civil and not a religious institution, since after all the killing of a man by a premature autopsy is a plain case of homicide. The fact of the matter seems to be that Vesalius, who had not been very well in the unsuitable climate of Ma- drid, made the trip to the Holy Land, partly for reasons of health, but partly also for reasons of piety. While returning he was shipwrecked on the island of Zante and died from exposure. Vesalius had been born in Brabant, at that time one of the most faithful Catholic countries in Europe. Like most of the other great men of his time, the reformation utterly failed to tempt him from his adhesion to the Catholic Church. His greatest colleagues in anatomy and in medicine were Italians, most of whom were in intimate relations with the Cath- olic ecclesiastics of the time and continued this intimacy in spite of the disturbing influences that were abroad. Many of these men will be mentioned in our account of the Papal Medical School and of the Papal Physicians during the next two or three centuries. The distin- guished anatomists and physicians of France in Vesa- liusâ€™s time were quite as faithful Catholics as he was. Even Paracelsus, the Swiss, whose thorough-going in- dependence of mind would, it might naturally seem, have tempted him to take up with the reformed doc- trines, had no sympathy with them at all. He recog- nized the abuses in the Church, but said that Luther and the so-called reformers were doing much more harm

“Great additions have of late been made to our knowledge of the past; the long conspiracy against the revelation of truth has gradually given way, and com- peting historians all over the civilized world have been zealous to take advantage of the change. The printing of archives has kept pace with the admission of en- quirers ; and the total mass of new matter, which the last half-century has accumulated, amounts to many thousands of volumes. In view of changes and of gains such as these, it has become impossible for the histori- cal writer of the present age to trust without reserve even to the most respected secondary authorities. The honest student finds himself continually deserted, re- tarded, misled by the classics of historical literature, and has to hew his own way through multitudinous transactions, periodicals and official publications in order to reach the truth. ‘ ‘ Ultimate history cannot be obtained in this genera- tion ; but, so far as documentary evidence is at com- mand, conventional history can be discarded, and the point can be shown that has been reached on the road from one to the other.’’ (Preface of Cambridge Mod- ern History.)

THE POPES AND SCIENCE 140 occurred during the fourteenth century. The abuses which his regulations in this matter led to did not cul- minate in his time, but came later. The revenues obtained by him were, as we shall see, used to excellent purpose, and were applied to such educational and mis- sionary uses as would eminently meet the approval of the most demanding of critics in modern times. John was a liberal and discriminating patron of learn- ing and of education in his time. He helped colleges in various parts of the world, established a college in the East, and sent out many missionaries at his own ex- pense. These missionaries proved as efficient as modern travelers in adding to the knowledge of the East at that time, and practically laid the foundations of the science of geography.1 What is of special interest to us here, however, in this volume, is the fact that Pope John gave all the weight of the Papal authority, the most important in- fluence of the time in Europe, to the encouragement of medical schools, the maintenance of a high standard in them, and the development of scientific medicine. At this time medicine included many of the physical sciences as we know them at the present time. Botany, mineralogy, climatology, even astrology, as astronomy was then called, were the subjects of study by physi- cians, the last named because of the supposed influence of the stars on the human constitution. Because of his encouragement of medical schools and his emphatic in- sistence on their maintaining high standards, Pope John must be commended as a patron of science and as prob- 1 Those who are interested in the wonderful things accomplished for geography by these missionary travelers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, will find a brief account of them in the chapter on Geography and Exploration in my book on The Thirteenth, Greatest of Centuries.

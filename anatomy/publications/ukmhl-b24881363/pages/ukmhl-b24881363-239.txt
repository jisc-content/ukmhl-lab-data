219 PAPAL PHYSICIANS an intimate friend of Morgagni. His scarcely less fa- mous successor, Pope Clement XIII., had known Mor- gagni before his elevation to the Papacy, and after his election he wrote assuring Morgagni of his continued esteem and friendship, and asks him to consider the Papal palace always open to him on his visits to Rome. In an extant letter Clement praises his wisdom, his cul- ture, his courtesy, his piety toward God, his charity to- ward men, and holds him up as an example to all others for the special reason that, notwithstanding all his qualities, he had not aroused the enmity or envy of those around him, thus showing what a depth of hu- manity there was in him in addition to his scientific attainments. At this time Morgagni was looked upon by all the medical world as probably the greatest of living medical scientists. Visitors who came to Italy who were at all interested in science, always considered that their jour- ney had not been quite complete unless they had had an opportunity of meeting Morgagni. He had more per- sonal friends among the scientists of all the countries of Europe than any other man of his time. The fact that this leader in science should be at the same time a great personal friend of the Popes of his time is the best pos- sible evidence of the more than amicable relations which existed between the Church and medicine during this century. Morgagniâ€™s life of nearly ninety years indeed, covers most of the eighteenth century, and is of itself, without more ado, an absolute proof that there was not only no friction between religion and medicine, but shows on the contrary that medical science encountered patron- age and encouragement as far as ecclesiastics were con- cerned, while success in it brought honor and emolument.

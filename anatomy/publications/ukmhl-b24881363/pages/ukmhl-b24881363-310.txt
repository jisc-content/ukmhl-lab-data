290 THE POPES AND SCIENCE brewing industry in France, that he thought it un- worthy of a French scientist to devote himself to a mere money-making industry. For a man of the modern time, perhaps the most interesting expression that ever fell from Roger Bacon’s lips is his famous proclamation of the reasons why men do not obtain genuine knowledge more rapidly than would seem ought to be the case, from the care and time and amount of work which they have devoted to its cultivation.

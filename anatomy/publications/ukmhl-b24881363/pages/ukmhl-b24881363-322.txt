(302) CHURCHMEN AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE AT THE MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES. There can be no doubt at all in the minds of those who know anything about the early history of the univer- sities, but that the Popes were entirely favorable to the great educational movement represented by these insti- tutions. It is ordinarily supposed, however, that the medieval universities limited their attention to philos- ophy and theology, and that even these subjects were studied from such narrow religious standpoints, as to make them of very little value for the development of human knowledge or the evolution of the human mind. Any such supposition is the result of ignorance on the part of those who entertain it, as to the actual curricu- lum of studies at the early universities, though it is not surprising that it should be very common, because, un- fortunately, it has been fostered by many writers on educational subjects, especially in English. Scholasti- cism is often said to have been the very acme of absur- dity in teaching, and its real import is entirely missed. Students and professors are supposed to have been limited in their interests to dialectics and metaphysics in the narrowest sense of these terms, and much time was, according to even presumably good authorities, frittered away in idle speculations with regard to things that are absolutely unknowable.1 1 Much of the remainder of this chapter is taken from the chapter on What and How They Studied at the Universities, in my book The Thirteenth Greatest of Cen- turies. (Catholic Summer School Press. N. Y.) Some of the sources from which the material is obtained will be found more fully referred to there, and further informa- tion with regard to scientific studies at these universities will be found in the chapter

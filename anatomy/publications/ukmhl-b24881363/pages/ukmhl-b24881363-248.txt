The presence of the future Pope at Salerno is, moreover, the best possible index of the sym- pathy between the ecclesiastical authorities and the medical school. Besides there are definite records of the friendship which existed between Alphanus, Archbishop of Salerno, and Desiderius, while they were both members of the Benedictine Community of Monte Cassino.

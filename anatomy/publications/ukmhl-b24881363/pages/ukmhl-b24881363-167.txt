147 PAPAL PATRON OF SCIENCE with regard to alchemy was flawless, I shall be careful not to undo his compliment.1 4 ‘ ‘ Seeking to discover how the sons of men know and serve God by the practice of the Christian religion, we look down from the watch-tower where, though un- worthy, we have been placed by the favoring clemency of Him who made the first man after His own image and likeness ; setting him over earthly things ; adorning him with heavenly virtues ; recalling him when a wan- derer ; bestowing on him a law; freeing him from slavery ; finding him when he was lost; and finally ran- soming him from captivity by the merit of His passion. With grief we discover, and the very thought of it wrings our soul with anguish, that there are many Christians only in name ; many who turn away from the light which once was theirs, and allow their minds to be so clouded with the darkness of error as to enter into a league with death and a compact with hell. They sacrifice to demons and adore them, they make or cause to be made images, rings, mirrors, phials or some such things in which by the art of magic evil spirits are to be enclosed. From them they seek and receive replies, and ask aid in satisfying their evil desires. For a foul pur- pose they submit to the foulest slavery. Alas ! this deadly malady is increasing more than usual in the world and inflicting greater and greater ravages on the flock of Christ. “Section I.—Since, therefore, we are bound by the duty of our pastoral office to bring back to the fold of Christ the sheep who are wandering through devious ways and to exclude from the Lord’s flock those who are diseased lest they should infect the rest, We, by this edict, which, in_ accordance with the counsel of our brother bishops, is to remain in perpetual vigor, warn all and in virtue of holy obedience and under pain of anathema enjoin on all those who have been regenerated m the waters of baptism not to inculcate or study any oi the perverse teachings we have mentioned, or what is more to be condemned, practise them in any manner upon any one. 1 The full Latin text of this bull will be found in the appendix.

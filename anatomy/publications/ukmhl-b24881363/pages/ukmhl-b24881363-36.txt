But it will at once be said, what of Galileo ? Does not his case show the anti-scientific temper of churchmen ? Nearly half a century ago, Cardinal Newman in his Apologia characteristically observed that this very case sufficed to prove that the Church did not set herself against scientific progress, for this is the “one stock argument” to the contrary, “the exception which proves the rule.” Commenting upon the Galileo inci- dent, Professor Augustus de Morgan, in his article on the Motion of the Earth in the English Encyclopedia, has expressed exactly the same conclusion. He is an authority not likely to be suspected of Catholic sym- pathy.

It is the standing proof that an authority which has

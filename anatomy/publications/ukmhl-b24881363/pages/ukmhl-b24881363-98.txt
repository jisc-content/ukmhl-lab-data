78 THE POPES AND SCIENCE the 8th of February, 1429. On the 4th of April, 1430, the dissection of a woman was made. In 1444 Professor Montagnana speaks of fourteen dissections at which he had been present.‚Äù (This would seem to indicate that dissections were quite common and that the occasional rec- ords of them give no proper idea of their actual number.) I would not wish to produce the impression, however, that Italy was the only place in Europe in which dissec- tions were freely done during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There is no doubt that anatomy and surgery and every branch of medicine was cultivated much more assiduously and with much better opportunities pro- vided for students down in Italy, than anywhere else in the world. This of itself alone shows the utter absurd- ity of the declarations that the Church was opposed to medical progress in any way, since the nearer the center of Christendom, the more ardor there was for investiga- tion and the more liberty to pursue original researches. Other countries also began to wake up to the spirit of pro- gress in medical education that was abroad. In France there were two centers of interest in anatomy. One of these was at Montpelier, the other at Paris. It is inter- esting to note, however, that the men to whom anatom- ical progress is due at these universities obtained their training, or at least had taken advantage of the special opportunities provided for anatomical investigation to be had, in the Italian cities. Guy de Chauliac I have already mentioned. He is spoken of as the Father of Modern Surgery, and there is no doubt that he did much to set surgery on a very practical basis and to make anat- omy a fundamental feature of the training for it. He declared that it was absurd to think that surgeons could do good work unless they knew their anatomy.

INTRODUCTION' 3 to help free the people from the bondage of superstition, of which they were the victims and the slaves. We do not think that we exaggerate the impression likely to be obtained from Dr. White’s book in stating the ordinarily accepted opinions thus baldly, and as a matter of fact, as the quotation marks are intended to show, most of the strongest phrases that we have used are Dr. White’s own.

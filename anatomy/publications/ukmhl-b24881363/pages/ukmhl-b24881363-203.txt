183 CHURCH AND SURGERY sutures well and discreetly (p. 9), but with far too many salves. On fractures of the skull he is at his best; he noted the escape of cerebro-spinal fluid, and the effect of pressure on the respiration. It is somewhat strange that in days of war the study of chest wounds had been rather neglected by Galen, Haly, and Avicenna; their practice, however, was to leave them open, lest pus should gather about the heart. Theodoric and Henry ordered chest wounds to be closed ‘ lest the vital spirits escape/ Guy also closed these wounds, unless there were any effusion to be removed. In empyema he objects to caustics and prefers the knife. For haem- orrhages he used sutures—a little too closely perhaps— styptics, cautery or ligature. Sinuses he dilated with tents of gentian root, or he incised them upon a director. On ulcers his large experience is fully manifest. He describes the carcinomatous kind as hopeless, unless the mass can be excised at a very early stage and the inci- sion followed by caustics. If in fractures and disloca- tions he tells us nothing new, these sections testify to a remarkable fulness of knowledge at a period when the Hippocratic treatises were unknown. Haeser says that in respect of position in fractured femur he was the best physician in the Middle Ages.” This is the period, it must not be forgotten, when, ac- cording to President White, surgery was in such a state that the application of various ordures relieved fractures; the touch of the hangman cured sprains; the breath of a donkey expelled poison; friction with a dead man's tooth cured a toothache.1 1 Quite as curious notions as these which President White mentions still exist In popular medicine in our own day. I have myself known a man to blow the dried ex- crement of the dog into the throat of his child suffering from diphtheria, and he as- rured me that it cured him. In the country districts they still use ordure poultices

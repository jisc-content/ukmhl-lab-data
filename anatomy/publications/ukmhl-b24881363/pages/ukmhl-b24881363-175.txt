155 PAPAL PATRON OF SCIENCE the present time the situation is not entirely satisfac- tory. A very curious element in the situation lies in the fact that, in comparison to the number of students, certain of the smaller universities confer this distinction much more frequently than the larger universities. This was found to be true even among the German univer- sities, where I believe that according to statistics the little University of Rostock, in Mecklenberg, confers the degree proportionately oftener than any other German university. Pope John XXII. was evidently endeavor- ing to prevent any such development as this, or perhaps he was trying to remedy an abuse which he knew had already crept in, for all of his bulls on educational mat- ters insist with no little emphasis on the necessity for the maintenance of a high standard of educational re- quirements as regards the length of time in years and the books to be read and lectures attended, as well as on the rigor, yet absolute fairness of examinations. I am sure that the bulls of John XXII. must never have come under President White’s eyes, or he, as an ex- perienced educator who has had to meet most of these problems in our time, would have been more sympathetic with this medieval ecclesiastic, who did all in his power to maintain university standards. Pope John’s career deserves study by all modern educators for this reason, and the surprise of it will be that in education, as prac- tically in everything else, in spite of our present-day self-complacency in the matter of educational progress, there is nothing new under the sun, certainly nothing new in the problems university authorities have to meet in order to maintain their standards. The best possible proof that Pope John XXII. was not opposed in any way to the development of science nor

THE POPES AND SCIENCE 184 Lest it should be thought that possibly Professor All- butt had been rather partial to the great Father of Mod- ern Surgery in his enthusiasm for these medieval sur- geons, it seems worth while to compress here some- thing of what Pagel has to say with regard to this great man, who represents in himself a full hundred years of progress in surgery. He wrote an immense text-book of surgery, from which his teaching may be learned with absolute authenticity. The great significance attached to Guy’s writings by his contemporaries and successors will be readily appreciated from the immense number of manuscript copies, original editions in print, and the many translations which are extant. This monument of scientific surgery has for dedication a sentence that would alone and of itself obliterate all the nonsense that has been talked about Papal opposition to the develop- ment of surgery. It runs as follows (I dedicate this work) “To you my masters, physi- cians of Montpelier, Bologna, Paris, and Avignon, es- pecially you of the Papal Court with whom I have been associated in the service of the Roman Pontiffs. The exact words as given by Pagel are “ Vobis dominis meis medicis Montispessulani, Bononim, Parisiis atque Avini- onis, praecipue papalibus, quibus me in servitio Roma- norum pontificum associavi.” Pagel has three closely printed pages in small type of titles alone of subjects which Chauliac treated with dis- f or sprains of various kinds, and I have known doctors prescribe them.. I have seen an intelligent woman smoking dried angleworms in a pipe for toothache. I sincerely hope, however, that no serious (!) historian of the twenty-fifth century will gather up side remarks like the present with regard to such curious customs—real superstitions that have nothing to do with religion, as most supersititions have not—and state them as showing the ignorance of our generation, and above all as indicating the low stats of medicine in our time.

THE POPES AND SCIENCE 132 Hoefer, the French historian of chemistry, mentions the fact that Pope John XXII. took severe measures against the alchemists who then wandered throughout the country, seeking to enrich themselves at the expense of the credulity of the people. He evidently knew of this decree then, but he says nothing of its forbidding or being misinterpreted, so as to seem to forbid chemi- cal investigation. Thomson, the English historian of chemistry, has no mention of any break in the develop- ment of chemical science, caused by any action of the Popes, though, to the surprise doubtless of most readers, he devotes considerable space to the history of chemical investigation during the thirteenth and fourteenth cen- turies. Ernst von Meyer mentions the fact that alchemy was abused by charlatans, in order to make pretended gold and silver, and notes that there was not so much interest in chemistry in the fourteenth as in the thir- teenth century, but does not ascribe this fact to the bull of Pope John. I expected at least that I should find something with regard to the question of the possible influence of the bull in Berthelot’s “History of Chemistry in the Middle Ages.”1 But though there are various historical topics treated that would seem to imply the necessity for say- ing something about the bull, if it had any such effect as described, yet there is no mention of it. He men- tions the Franciscan alchemists of northern Italy, who lived about this time, and discusses the “Rosarium,” written very probably after the date of the bull by a Franciscan monk, but there is no suggestion as to any hampering of alchemy by Papal or other ecclesiastical restrictions. 1 Berthelot’s Histoire de la Chimie au Moyen Age.

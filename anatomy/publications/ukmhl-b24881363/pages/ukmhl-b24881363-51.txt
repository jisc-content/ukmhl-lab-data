SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 31 hension of its meaning. Here we have an excellent il- lustration of what the editors of the Cambridge Modern History declared to be the breaking up of the long con- spiracy against the truth by the consultation of original documents. Through the kindness of the Rev. D. A. Corbett, of the Seminary of St. Charles Borromeo, Overbrook, Pa., I have been able to secure a copy of Pope Boniface’s de- cree, and this at once disposes of the assertion that dis- section was forbidden or anatomy in any way hampered by it. Father Corbett writes : “ The Bull De Sepulturis of Boniface VIII. is not found in the Collectio Bullarum of Coquelines, nor is it incor- porated in the Liber Sextus Decretalium Divi Bonifacii Papas VIII., though it is from here that it is quoted in the Histoire Litteraire de la France (as referred to by President White). It appears in an appendix to this sixth book among the Extravagantes, a term that is used to signify that the documents contained under it were issued at a time somewhat apart from the period this special book of decretals was supposed to cover. The Liber Sextus was published in 1298. This ‘ Bull De Se- pulturis ’ was not issued until 1300. It is to be found in the third book of the Extravagantes, Chapter I.” Even a glance at the title would seem to be sufficient to show that this document did not refer even distantly to dissection, and this makes it all the harder to under- stand the misapprehension that ensued in the matter, if the document was quoted in good faith, for usually the compression necessary in the title is the source of such errors. The full text of the bull only confirms the abso- lute absence of any suggestion of forbidding dissection or discouraging the study of anatomy.

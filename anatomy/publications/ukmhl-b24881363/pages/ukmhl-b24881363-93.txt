These two dissec- tions of females happened only to have special features that made them noteworthy.) “A few years later (1319) there is a remarkable document which tells the story of body-snatching for dissecting purposes. ” (This would seem to be sufficient of itself to show that a number of dissections were being done, and, indeed, as I have already said, Rashdall, in his History of the Universities, states that, according to the University statutes teachers were bound to dissect such bodies as students brought to them.) Roth concludes with the words (italics are mine): “These are a few, but weighty testimonies for the zeal with which Bologna pursued anat- omy in the fourteenth century.” (I may add that all of these concern the twenty years immediately following Pope Boniface’s supposed prohibition.) Nor was the custom of making dissections any less active during the rest of the half century after the time when, if we are to believe Professor White, the decree of Boniface had been universally interpreted to forbid it. In a note to his history of dissection during this period in Bologna, Roth says : ‘ ‘ Without doubt the passage in

INTROD UCTION 7 have often emphatically declared that medieval teach- ers did not do, but should have done, in the Middle Ages. It is not surprising then to find that William himself, and his great pupil Lanfranc, insisted on the utter inadvisability of separating medicine and surgery in such a way that the physician would not have the op- portunity to be present at operations, and thus gain more definite knowledge about the actual conditions of various organs which he had tried to investigate from the surface of the body. It is a very curious coincidence that both the Regius Professors of Physic in England at the present time, our own Professor Osier, now at Ox- ford, as well as his colleague, Professor Allbutt, of Cam- bridge, have within the last five years emphasized this same idea in almost the very words which were used by William and Lanfranc nearly seven hundred years ago. Lanfranc went even beyond his master in practical applications of important scientific principles to medi- cine and surgery. He added to the means of controlling hemorrhage. In arterial hemorrhage he suggested dig- ital compression for an hour, or in severe cases ligature. His master had studied wounds of the neck. Lanfranc has a magnificent chapter on injuries of the head, which Professor Allbutt does not hesitate to call one of the classics of surgery. Lanfranc was thoroughly appre- ciated by his contemporaries. After years of study and teaching in Italy he was invited to Paris, where he be- came one of the lights of that great university. Both Salicet and Lanfranc did their wonderful work in scien- tific medicine down in Italy where ecclesiastical influ- ence was strongest. Italy continued to be for the next six centuries always the home of the best medical schools in the world, to which the most ardent students from

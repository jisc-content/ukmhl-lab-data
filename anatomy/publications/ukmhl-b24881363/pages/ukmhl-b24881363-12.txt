Our Ladyâ€™s Day, March 25, 1911. are getting at the sources of history and every new de- velopment shows how misunderstood, whether deliberately or indeliberately, has been the position of the Catholic Church in the past. Nowhere is this more true than in all that regards the relations of the Popes and the Church to science, yet nowhere is the simple truth as founded on contemporary documents a more striking vindication of the Church. The cultivation of science is not her duty and had ecclesiastics been indifferent they could not have been blamed. They are said to have been bitterly opposed. The details of the history of science serve to show that the Church was as much a patron of science in every way, as of painting, sculpture, architecture, the decorative arts, of the making of beautiful books, of beautiful needle- work, of music, of poetry, of every phase of education. The story of what the Church did for all these I have told in detail in another volume, The Thirteenth The Greatest of Centuries. In this the story of Papal patron- age of science, quite as sedulous and liberal, stands out clearly as one of the great facts of history. Our Holy Father, Pope Pius X., graciously accepted the dedication of the volume on its appearance in its first edition. I am glad indeed that the second edition, still bearing his name in the dedication, appears under the auspices of his de- voted sons in America, my brother Knights of Columbus.

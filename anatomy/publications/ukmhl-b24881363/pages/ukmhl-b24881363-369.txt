349 UNIVERSITY MAN AND SCIENCE few generations. The other quotation to which Profes- sor Kuhns refers deserves to be quoted entire. It is perhaps even more striking because of its actual de- scription of an experiment in optics, which shows how much this great poetic intelligence of the medieval time, usually supposed to be so abstracted and occupied with things other-worldly and supernal, living his intellectual life quite beyond the domain of sense, still remembered the teachings of his university days, and even recalled the details of demonstrations that he had seen. The passage occurs in the II. canto of the Paradiso, begin- ning with line 97: Take thou three mirrors, two of them remove From thee an equal distance, and the last Between the two, and further from thee move ; And turned towards them let a light be cast, Behind thy back, upon those mirrors three, So that from all reflected rays are passed. Then, though the light which furthest stands from thee May not with them in magnitude compete, Yet will it shine in brightness equally.” It is easy to understand, then, that Professor Kuhns should have been enthusiastic with regard to Dante’s knowledge of science. He says : “The whole structure of Hell, Purgatory, and Para- dise shows a thorough knowledge of the Ptolemaic sys- tem ; and we invariably find astronomical facts, mingled with classical quotations, in the description of stellar phenomena. But not only in specific passages do we find evidence of Dante’s love for science, but in brief allusions to the various aspects of nature—metaphors.

237 PAPAL MEDICAL SCHOOL alpinus as a great naturalist and medical scientist, I prefer to quote the description of him given by Professor Michael Foster in his lectures on the History of Physi- ology, delivered in this country as the Lane Lectures, at the Cooper Medical College in San Francisco, and pub- lished by the Cambridge University Press, 1901. Pro- fessor Foster was not one to exaggerate the claims of any Italian, and least of all of any Italian who might be sup- posed to have a claim that would stand against Harvey’s. The soupcon of Chauvinism in his treatment of Servetus and Columbus in this regard is indeed rather amusing. He said:— “ of a very different stamp to Columbus was Andreas Csesalpinus.

Learned in all the learning of the ancients and an enthusiastic Aristotelian, he also early laid hold of all the new learning of the time. Naturalist as well as physician, he taught at Pisa botany as well as medicine, being from 1555 to 1575 Professor of Botany, with charge of the Botanic garden founded there in 1543, the first of its kind—one remaining until the present day.” Professor Foster admits that Csesalpinus had a won- derful power of synthetising knowledge already in hand and anticipating conclusions in science that were to be confirmed subsequently. In his Medical Questions, though the work is written in rambling, discursive vein, he enunciated views which, however he arrived at them, certainly foreshadowed or even anticipated those which

CHURCHMEN AND SCIENCE 337 touch on. One book of his work is concerned with human anatomy, and the concluding portion of it is an abbreviation of history carried down to the year 1250.” It might be considered that such a compend of in- formation would be very dry-as-dust reading and that it would be fragmentary in character and little likely to be attractive except to a serious student. Dr. Pagel’s opinion does not agree with this a priori impression.

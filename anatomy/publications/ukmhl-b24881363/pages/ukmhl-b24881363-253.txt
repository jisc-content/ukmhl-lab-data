233 papal medical school attended that, as he himself tells in a letter to a friend, he often had several hundred persons in his audience when he gave his anatomical demonstrations on the cadaver. These were not all medical students, but many of them were ecclesiastics, and some of them important members of the hierarchy. Even cardinals manifested their interest in anatomy, and occasionally attended the public dissections—public, that is, as far as the Uni- versity is concerned—which were made by Columbus. Columbus’s enthusiasm for anatomy was such that, as Dr. Fisher said of him in the Annals of Anatomy and Surgery, Brooklyn, 1878-1880, “he dissected an extra- ordinary number of human bodies, and so devoted him- self to the solution of problems in anatomy and physi- ology that he has been most aptly styled the Claude Bernard of the sixteenth century.” In one year, foi in- stance, he is said to have dissected no less than fourteen bodies, demonstrating, as Dr. Fisher has said, that “it was an age of remarkable tolerance for scientific in- vestigation.” Besides being an investigator, Columbus was a great teacher, and many of our modern methods of instruction in medical schools had their origin in the system of de- monstrations introduced by him. His descriptions of the demonstrations for students upon living animals, show that some of the most recent ideas in medical teaching were anticipated by this Roman professor of anatomy and medicine in the Renaissance period. His demonstrations of the heart and blood-vessels and of the actions of the lungs are particularly complete, and must have given his students a very practical working knowledge of these important physiological functions. In a word, the medical teaching of the Roman Uni-

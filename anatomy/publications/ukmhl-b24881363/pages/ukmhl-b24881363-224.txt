THE POPES AND SCIENCE 204 lacking in a critical judgment as to the remedies and methods of treatment of which they become the willing recipients, and occasionally even the sponsors as regards other people, who look up to their judgment for other reasons with confidence. Prof. Osier once said that the nearer to the Council of Trent the clergyman, the nearer he was likely to be to truth and common sense in medi- cal matters ; but then perhaps all would not agree with him. It is all the more surprising under the circum- stances, and very greatly to their credit, that the Popes should have had as their physicians a list of men whose names are the brightest on the roll of great contributors to medical literature and some of the most distinguished among the great discoverers in medical science. This fact alone constitutes the most absolute contradic- tion of the declarations as to supposed Church opposition to medicine that could possibly be .given. No better means of encouraging, fostering, and patronizing medical science could be thought of than to give the prestige and the emoluments of physician to the head of the Church to important makers of medicine in every generation. The physicians to the rulers of Europe have not always been selected with as good judgment, and, as I have al- ready said, there is no list of physicians to any European Court, nor indeed any list of names of medical men con- nected together by any bond in history—no list, for in- stance, of any medical faculty of a university—which can be compared for prestige in scientific medicine with the Papal Physicians. Before the beginning of the thirteenth century very little is known of the medical attendants of the Popes. We point out in the following chapter that the Papacy was closely in touch with the medical school at Salernum.

115 THE GOLDEN AGE OF ANATOMY tinguished investigators into medical subjects and whose names are in some way connected with some of the most noteworthy teaching and writing in medical matters during the seventeenth century. It will be readily seen what a caricature of the life of Vesalius is Prof. White’s paragraph, if one compares it with the following paragraph taken from so readily available an historical source as the article on the His- tory of Anatomy, by Prof. Turner, of Edinburgh, in the first volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The dis- tinguished Scotch anatomist who so worthily filled the chair of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh says with regard to Berengar of Carpi, who was the professor of anatomy at Bologna thirty-five years before Vesalius’s time, that, “In the annals of medicine Berengar’sname will be remembered as one of the most zealous and emi- nent in cultivating the anatomy of the human body. It was long before the anatomists of the following age could boast of equalling him. His assiduity was inde- fatigable, and he declares that he dissected above one hundred human bodies.” This should be enough, it seems to me, to settle the question that anatomy was permitted very freely before Vesalius’s time. Professor Turner’s authority in such a matter is above all suspi- cion. He knew the history of anatomy. If more evidence be needed, compare with President White’s fantastic sketch of Vesalius the following sketch of his great contemporary, Columbus or Colombo, to whose anatomical investigations we owe the discovery of the pulmonary circulation : “The fame of Columbus as an anatomical teacher was exceedingly great and widespread. Students were at- tracted to the universities where he professed, from all

62 THE POPES AND SCIENCE times. It will not be hard to show that there was a con- stant development and an unfailing interest in this sub- ject. This can be understood even more clearly from the story of the development of surgery in the Middle Ages and its relations to anatomy than from the history of anatomy itself. As is well known, materials with re- gard to practical and applied science interest men more at all times, and documents with regard to them are more likely to be preserved, and so the history of sur- gery is very full, while the history of anatomy may prove not quite so satisfactory. It is true of all sciences, that there are periods when they have much less attraction than at other times, and the success of investigators and original workers is not always the same. As in nearly everything else, the real advances in all science come when genius makes its mark, and not merely because a large number of men happen to be interested in the subject. This will be found as true in anatomy as in other sciences, and so there are periods when not much is doing, but nowhere is there a trace of ecclesiastical opposition to account for these variations of interest. There is no doubt at all that there was much popular opposition to the practice of dissection in the Middle Ages; that has existed at all times in the worldâ€™s his- tory. It was very pronounced among the old Pagans in Rome as well as in Greece, and it prevented anatomical study to a very great degree. It continued to exist in modem times until almost the present generation. In- deed, it has not yet entirely disappeared, as any physi- cian who has tried to secure autopsies on interesting cases knows very well. The New York Academy of Medicine is only a little over a half century old, and yet nearly every one of its early presidents had thrilling ex-

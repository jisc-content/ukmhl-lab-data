306 THE POPES AND SCIENCE show that their minds were occupied with just the same problems that interest us, and the wonderful thing is that they anticipated so many of our conclusions, though these anticipations are wrapped up not infrequently in a terminology that obscures their meaning for any but the patient, sympathetic student. In his Harveian Lecture, Science and Medieval Thought, Prof essor Clifford Allbutt, of the University of Cambridge, England, said â€˜ Each period of human achievement has its phases of spring, culmination, and decline ; and it is in its decline that the leafless tree comes to judgment. In the un- loveliness of decay, the Middle Ages are as other ages have been as our own will be ; but in those ages there was more than one outburst of life ; more than once the enthusiasm of the youth of the West went out to explore the ways of the realm of ideas ; and if we believe our- selves at last to have found the only thoroughfare, we owe this knowledge to those who before us traveled the uncharted seas. If we have inherited a great commerce and dominion of science, it is because their argosies had been on the ocean and their camels on the desert. Dis- cipulus est prioris posterior dies; man cannot know all at once ; knowledge must be built up by laborious gen- erations. In all times, as in our own, the advance of knowledge is very largely by elimination and negation ; we ascertain what is not true, and we weed it out. To perceive and respect the limits of the knowable, we must have sought to transgress them. We can build our bridge over the chasm of ignorance with stored material in which the thirteenth century was poor indeed; we can fix our bearings where then was no foundation ; yet man may be well engaged when he knows not the ends of his work ; and the schoolmen in digging for treasure cultivated the field of knowledge, even for Galileo and Harvey, for Newton and Darwin. Their many errors came not of indolence, for they were passionate workers ; not of hatred of light, for they were eager for the light; not of fickleness, for they wrought with unparalleled devotion ; nor indeed of ignorance of particular things,

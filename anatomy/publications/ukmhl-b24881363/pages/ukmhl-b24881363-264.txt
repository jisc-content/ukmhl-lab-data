Shortly after this Rome became a serious competitor in medical education. Practically, then, this was a second Papal medical school, almost as directly under the control of the Popes as the Roman Medical School. Far from there being any diminution in the glory or the efficiency of the Bolognese Medical School, its reputation even became enhanced after the city came under the control of the Popes. This is all the more surprising because, as we have shown, just about this time the Popes began the work of making their Medical School at Rome the most im- portant center for medical education, especially in the scientific phases of medicine—anatomy, physiology, and comparative anatomy—that there was at that time in the world.

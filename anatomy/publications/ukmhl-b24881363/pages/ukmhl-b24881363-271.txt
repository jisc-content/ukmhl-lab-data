It is no less a person than Virchow, the greatest of modern medical scientists, who has traced the origins of the modern German city hospitals back to Innocent and given us a list of those which were established during the century following his pontificate. Here are the names of those towns from Virchow’s list in which hos- pitals were founded during the thirteenth century in Germany alone, which will show very convincingly how widespread the hospital establishment movement was : Zurich, St. Gallen, Bern, Basel, Constanz, Villingen, Pfullendorf, Freiburg, Breisch, Stephansfelden, Oppen- heim, Mainz, Speyer, Coblenz (an der Leer), Cologne, Crefeld, Ulm, Biberach, Rothenburg, Kirchheim, Mer- gentheim, Wimpfen, Reutlingen, Memmingen, Augsburg, Rothenburg a.

SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 41 As I think must be clear to any one who knows Mon- dino’s book, no other conclusion than this suggested by Prof. Pilcher can be drawn. This opinion has been frankly stated by every historian of anatomy in recent years. Puschmann says it very clearly. Von Toply is evidently of the same opinion. These are the latest au- thorities in the history of anatomy. No other conclu- sion than this could well be reached by anyone who has studied the question seriously. Pilcher confirms this in the article already quoted in the following paragraph : ‘ ‘ Salernum was not alone in its legalization of the dis- section of human bodies before the first public work of Mondino, for, according to a document of the Maggiore Consiglio of Venice of 1308, it appears that there was a college of medicine in Venice, which was even then au- thorized to dissect a body once every year. Common experience tells us that the embodiment of such regula- tions into formal law would occur only after a consider- able preceding period of discussion, and in this particular field, of clandestine practice. It is too much to ask us to believe that in all this period, from the date of the promulgation of Frederick’s decree of 1241 to the first public demonstration by Mondino at Bologna in 1315, the decree had been a dead letter and no human body had been anatomized.

Such a view seems to me to be incredible. Be that as it may, it is undeniable that at the beginning of the fourteenth century the idea of dissecting the human body was not a novel one; the im-

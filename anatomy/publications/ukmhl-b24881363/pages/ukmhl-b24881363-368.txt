THE POPES AND SCIENCE 348 Everyone realizes at once how profound a scientist was Goethe. Professor Kuhns’ comparison, then, will bring out the scientific qualities of this great medieval poet, who is the representative scholar of the universities of his time. “There is perhaps no innate contradiction between science and poetry, but it is not often that they are found together in the same man. Dante, like Goethe, half a millennium later, was. not only drawn by the beauty of nature, but he had likewise an unquenchable intellectual curiosity, and sought diligently to under- stand the meaning of the universe in which he lived. “No other poet has ever combined the loftiest poetry with the discussion of such complicated topics in all branches of learning.

There are thoughts in Dante’s exposition of the subject that are startling enough to the modern biologist, and that make it clear how much men’s minds run along the same grooves in facing questions that we are prone to think have occurred to men only in the last

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 301 cannot be got out. The great thinkers of the medieval period had not only reached the same conclusions as he did, but actually applied them three centuries before ; and the great medieval universities were occupied with problems, even in physical science, not very different from those which have given food for thought for sub- sequent generations. We shall see in the next chapter how successfully they applied these great principles of the experimental method, and how much they antici- pated many phases of science that we are apt to think of as distinctly modern.

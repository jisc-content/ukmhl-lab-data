THE POPES AND SCIENCE 314 pletely accounted for. The physicists on their part had realized this same truth, and finally there came the definite enunciation of the absolute indestructibility of matter. St. Thomas’s conclusion, “Nothing at all will ever be reduced to nothingness,” had anticipated this doctrine by nearly seven centuries. What happened in the nineteenth century was that there came an experi- mental demonstration of the truth of the principle. The principle itself, however, had been reached long before by the human mind, by speculative processes quite as inerrable in their way as the more modern method of investigation. When St. Thomas used the aphorism, “Nothing at all will ever be reduced to nothingness, ” there was another signification that he attached to the words quite as clearly as that by which they expressed the indestructi- bility of matter. For him nihil or nothing meant neither matter nor form, that is, neither the material substance nor the energy which is contained in it. He meant, then, that no energy would ever be destroyed as well as no matter would ever be annihilated. He was teaching the conservation of energy as well as the indestructibility of matter. Here once more the experimental demon- stration of the doctrine was delayed for over six centu- ries and a half. The truth itself, however, had been reached by this medieval master-mind, and was the sub- ject of his teaching to the university students in Paris in the thirteenth century. These examples should, I think, serve to illustrate that the minds of medieval students were occupied with practically the same ques- tions as those which are now taught to the university students of our day, and that the content of the teaching was identical with ours.

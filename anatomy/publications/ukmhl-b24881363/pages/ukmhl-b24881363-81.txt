He admits that the supposed bull of prohibition had quite a differ- ent purport, yet he still continued to assert its connec- tion with the failure of anatomy to develop during the Middle Ages. This presumed failure of anatomy during the Middle Ages is a myth.

To counteract the false impression that has gained such wide acceptance in this matter, it has seemed ad- visable, in order to settle the question definitely once and for all, to trace the history of anatomical science from its beginning in the Middle Ages down to modem

THE POPES AND SCIENCE 288 who did such excellent work in magnetism in the thir- teenth century, and sent to Friar Bacon the details of it with the loving solicitude of a pupil to a master.

Therefore, what others grope after blindly, as bats in the evening twilight, this man contemplates in all their brilliancy because he is a master of experiment Hence, he knows all of natural science, whether pertain- ing to medicine and alchemy, or to matters celestial or terrestrial. He has worked diligently in the smelting of ores, as also in the working of minerals ; he is thoroughly acquainted with all sorts of arms and implements used in military service and in hunting, besides which he is skilled in agriculture and in the measurement of lands. It is impossible to write a useful or correct treatise in experimental philosophy without mentioning this man’s name. Moreover, he pursues knowledge for its own sake ; for if he wished to obtain royal favor, he could easily find sovereigns who would honor and enrich him.” Brother Potamian’s reflections on this unexpected passage of Bacon are the best interpretation of it for the modern student of science. ‘ ‘ This last statement is worthy of the best utterances of the twentieth century. Say what they will, the most ardent pleaders of our day for original work and labor- atory methods, cannot surpass the Franciscan monk of the thirteenth century in his denunciation of mere book- learning, or in his advocacy of experiment and research ;

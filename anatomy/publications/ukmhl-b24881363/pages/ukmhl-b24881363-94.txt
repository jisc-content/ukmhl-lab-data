74 THE POPES AND SCIENCE Guy de Chauliac which tells of having very often (mul- titoties, many times, is the exact word) seen dissections must be considered as referring to Bologna.” This pas- sage runs as follows : ‘ ‘ My master, Bertruccius, con- ducted the dissection very often after the following man- ner : The dead body having been placed upon a bench, he used to make four lessons on it. First, the nutri- tional portions were treated, because they are so likely to become putrified. In the second, he demonstrated the spiritual members; in the third, the animate mem- bers ; in the fourth, the extremities.” (Guy de Chauliac was at Bologna studying under Bertruccius just before the middle of the fourteenth century. It is evident beyond all doubt, from what he says, that dissections were quite common. This is during the first fifty years after the decree. I shall show a little later that there are records of dissections during the second half of this century. Roth, however, goes on to tell next of the fif- teenth century.) Roth says nothing about the decree of Boniface VIII., nor of any possible effect that it had upon anatomy. The real historian, of course, does not mention things that have not happened. Roth confesses, as I have said, that he takes the material for his sketch of anatomy be- fore Vesalius’s time from Corradi.1 Corradi being an Italian, and knowing of the slander with regard to the Papal decree, explicitly denies it. Surely, here is ma- terial enough to convince anyone that all that Professor White has said with regard to the supposed effect of the misinterpretation of Boniface’s decree is without foun- dation in the history of anatomy.

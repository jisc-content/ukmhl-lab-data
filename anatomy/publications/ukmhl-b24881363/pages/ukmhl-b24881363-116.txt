THE POPES AND SCIENCE 96 oped, and they died with all the signs of poisoning. They were actually poisoned, not by some extraneous material, but by the putrid contents of their own intes- tines which found a way out through the ruptured ap- pendix. These cases were set down as poisoning cases, and usually some interested person was the subject of suspicion. Dr. Phreas’s learning had obtained for him an appointment to a bishopric in England, a curious bit of evidence of the absence of opposition between med- ical science and religion in his time. He died shortly after this, under circumstances that raised a suspicion of poisoning in the minds of some of his contemporaries— but raises the thought of appendicitis in mine,—and one of his rivals was blamed for it. Nor did the custom for English medical students to go down to Italy to complete their education cease with the so-called reformation. Some two generations after Vesa- lius’s time another distinguished Englishman, Harvey, went down to Italy to complete the studies he had al- ready made and eventually to lay the foundation of that knowledge on which he was twenty years later to con- struct his doctrine of the circulation of the blood. This doctrine, however, remained merely a theory until the distinguished Italian anatomist, Malpighi, after another half century, demonstrated the existence of the capillar- ies, the little blood vessels which connect the veins and arteries, and by thus showing the continuity of both the blood systems, proved beyond all doubt the certainty of the teaching that the blood does circulate. Students came, moreover, from even the distant North of Europe to the Italian schools of medicine during these centuries.

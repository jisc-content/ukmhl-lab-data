13 INTRODUCTION so gloriously representative of scientific progress in med- icine as the Papal physicians. The faculty of no medical school presents such a list of great names as those of the men who were chosen to be the official medical attend- ants of the Popes, and who were thus given a position of prominence where their discoveries in medicine had a vogue they otherwise could not have attained.

Probably there was never a more pretentious exhibition of ignorance of the facts of his- tory than is displayed by these expressions and by the whole drift of this chapter. Dr. White would have us

SUPPOSED PROHIBITION OF DISSECTION 29 riously, even though they are absolutely without founda- tion. That statements of this kind should have been made by men of distinction in educational circles and should have passed current so long, is only additional evidence of an intolerant spirit in those who least sus- pect it in themselves and are most ready to deprecate intolerance in others.

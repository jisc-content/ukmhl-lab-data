( xv- ) has been acquired as a gift, reference is made in this column to the donor's account of the case, if such a docu- ment accompanied the Preparation. The last column shews the source whence the Preparation was derived ; and records the names of those whose liberality has en- riched the Collection. When this column remains unoc- cupied, it may generally be correctly concluded that the Preparation was furnished by the Hospital itself: though it is to be regretted, that, in some instances, Gentlemen, who have kindly contributed to the Museum, have not attached their names to the Preparations. Endeavours have been used, as far as possible, to remedy the defi- ciency : and care will be taken to do so with respect to the cases which remain, if those who may observe them will be so obliging as to point them out. The preceding statement of the materials of which the Museum of Guy's Hospital has been composed, of the prin- ciples which have directed its arrangement, and of the motives which have led to the publication of the Catalogue, will, it is hoped, be sufficient to justify the object of this volume. The Author does not doubt, that, in the exe- cution, there are many points which are liable to criticism : but he will take upon himself to affirm, that those only can be competent to apportion the censure which may be due, who have themselves experienced the labour of a similar task. He trusts, that, even in its present state, the book may prove useful to the Pupils attached to the Medical and Surgical School of the Hospital, and more especially to the Gentlemen who attend the Lectures on Morbid Anatomy : but he expressly wishes it to be regarded rather as a work in process, than as a finished production; and he solicits those into whose hands it may fall, to contribute the ma- terials which are wanting to fill up the breaks which have unavoidably been left. As an imperfect victim was inadmissible as an offering, so, to compare small things with great, an unfinished work cannot with propriety be made the subject of dedication.

OUSEKVATIONS ON SECTION IV. OF PART I. there are four grey surfaces separated by Medullary matter; the proportion of which, it is true, differs in the two cases, but the analogy is preserved in the arrangement. Lastly, the Nerves which rise from each side of the Spinal Cord are represented by the plain of the Hemispheres, which we may consider as a series of Nerves in close apposition. " This analogy is by far the most striking, when the com- parison is made with a section of quite the upper part of the Spinal Cord of an Infant. " An important observation may be made with the Brain of a Child of two or three years of age. A transverse ver- tical section at the part opposite to the Coronal Suture displays the arrangement above described. Simple but well-defined white lines mark the central cylinder, ana- logous to the Spinal Marrow; and indicate the course of each of the three plains, which are not to be distinguished in the adult Brain until they have been artificially separated."

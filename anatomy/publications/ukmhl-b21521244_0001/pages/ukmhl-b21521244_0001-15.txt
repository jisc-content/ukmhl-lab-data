( xi ) Synovial Membranes, and Fibro-Cartilages of the Articu- lations ; and the Muscles, with their Fasciae, Bursae, and Tendons. The Third Section comprises the Heart, and the Three Vascular Systems —the Arterial, the Venous, and the Lymphatic or Absorbent, with its Glands. The Fourth contains the Nervous System and the Or- gans of the Senses, in the following order—the Spinal Cord, the Brain and Cerebellum, the Nerves of the Ce- rebro-spinal and Sympathetic Systems; the Common Inte- guments, as the seat of the simplest and most generally diffused sense, viz. that of Touch; and, afterwards, the Organs of more special sensations—the Nose, Eyes, Ears, and the Tongue. From the Tongue we are led to the Fifth Section, in which are placed the Vocal and Respiratory Organs, in the following order; in which it will be observed that we proceed from the Mouth downwards—the Larynx and Thyroid Gland, the Trachea and Bronchi, and Lungs and Pleura, and, lastly, the Thymus Gland. In the Sixth Section will be found the Digestive Organs, which, like the Respiratory Organs, are taken in order from the Mouth downwards. The section commences with the Salivary Glands, which, like the Gums and Teeth, which immediately follow them, are subservient to. the Vocal as well as to the Digestive function : after the dif- ferent portions of the Alimentary Canal, follow those Abdo- minal Viscera which are accessory to it; namely, the Liver, and its accompanying Gall-Bladder, the Pancreas, and the Spleen. The Urinary Organs form the subject of the Seventh Section, which therefore contains the Renal Capsules, the Kidneys, the Pelves of the Kidneys, the Ureters, and the Urinary Bladder. The Urinary Calculi which are given in the Seventh Section of Part II. are arranged, according to their chemical composition, in the order adopted by Dr. Prout.

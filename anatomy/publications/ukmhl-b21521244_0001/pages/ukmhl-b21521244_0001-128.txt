OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION IV. OF PART I. descends to the outer side of the inferior half of the grey substance of the Corpus Striatum, invests it below, and, advancing inwards, meets the corresponding plain from the opposite side, and, ascending in juxta-position with it on the median line, forms the Septum Lucidum of the Ven- tricles. " It is not all the Fibres of this plain which go directly to the Septum Lucidum. A considerable portion pass backwards, of which some form an expansion belonging specially to the Temporal Lobe; whilst others reach the large extremity of the Cornu Ammonis, and, becoming continuous with the Corpus Fimbriatum, pass into the Fornix, and thus form another communication with the Septum Lucidum. " I have too much consideration for the time of the Academy of Sciences, to allow myself to enter more minutely into anatomical details: and now proceed to the examination of the combination and mutual relation of the parts, to the consideration of which the preceding facts naturally lead. " If, when we have separated all the plains, so as to see their reciprocal relations, we make a transverse vertical section of the Brain, at that part which corresponds to the Coronal Suture, we may observe at the centre of this section a surface of two inches in diameter, which nearly resembles the section of a cylinder. The circumference of this cylinder, which is slightly hollowed both above and below, is entirely composed of Medullary matter. About the middle of its thickness we see, on each side, a large white surface; above and below which are two grey sur- faces. The plains of the Hemispheres extend to the right and left, from the sides of this cylinder; and do not exceed two lines in thickness. " If we compare this section with a transverse section of the Spinal Marrow, we cannot help being struck with the remarkable analogy which exists between the Spinal Marrow and the central part of the Brain. " In both, the external part is extremely white: in both.

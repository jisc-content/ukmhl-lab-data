OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION IV. OF PART I. It has been asserted, that the structure both of the Me- dullary Central Masses of the Nervous System, and also of its branches, is ultimately globular. The following ex- tracts from the microscopical observations already alluded to, tend to prove that this is by no means the case. Brain.—" If there is any organized animal substance which seems more likely than another to consist of globular particles, it is undoubtedly that of the Brain. Our ex- amination of it has, as yet, been but slight; but we have noticed, that when a portion of it, however fresh, is suffi- ciently extended to allow of its being viewed in the micro- scope, one sees, instead of globules, a multitude of very small particles, which are most irregular in shape and size, and are probably more dependent on the disintegra- tion than on the organization of the substance. The structure of some other parenchymatous parts appears equally indeterminate, presenting neither globule nor fibre." Nerves.—" These appear to be essentially composed of Fibres, but their structure is looser than that of Muscle. Though the Fibres of Nerves do not form such intricate plexuses as those of some other Tissues, their course is by no means straight. We have looked in vain for glo- bules, as well as for any trace of Medullary matter, which has been somewhat gratuitously supposed to be inclosed in the Nerves." It is generally known, that, within the last few years, our knowledge of the Anatomy of the Brain has been greatly enriched by the labours of Gall and Spurzheim, Reil, Tiedmann, Seres, Mayo, &c. &c. Those of Dr. Foville, of Rouen, though not less re- markable, are not so generally known. As his views differ,

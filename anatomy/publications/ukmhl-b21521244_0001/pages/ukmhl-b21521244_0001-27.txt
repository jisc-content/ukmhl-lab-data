OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION I. OF PART I. " Je commence par les os parceque toutes les autres parties du corps humain y ont rapport soit par leur situation soit par leurs attaches, soit par leur figure, ainsi la connoissance des parties osseuses conduit aux autres connoissances Anatomiques et par consequent elle doit les preceder."â€”Buffon. In this Section, the bones of the Cranium are placed in conjunction with the Vertebrae, in accordance with the views of several Modern Anatomists, who have regarded the head as composed of an assemblage of Vertebrae, or of bones referrible to the same type as the Vertebrae. The minute details of this question would require such a lengthened digression, into the subjects of Comparative Anatomy and Embryology, as would be inadmissible in this volume. The question, however, is one which, although it has arrested the attention of many distinguished Foreign Phy- siologists, has hitherto attracted but little notice in this country : hence it is hoped that the following sketch will not be considered misplaced. It is sufficiently obvious, that the Cranium resembles the assemblage of Vertebras designated by the name of Spine, in affording both support and, protection to a part of the central portion of the Nervous System. It does not appear that this resemblance had led to the suspicion of any further analogies between these two parts, until Professors Oken, of Bremen, and Dumeril, of Paris, the one in 1807, and the other in 1808, without any communication with each other, pointed out certain structural resemblances in the parts of which these two organs are composed. Both were led to the same conclusion, whilst engaged in the examination of the Crania and Vertebras of Fishes. Dumeril, in speaking of the Head, says that it is nothing but a Vertebra of gigantic dimensions; but he did not pursue the subject

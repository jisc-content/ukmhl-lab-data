OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION II. OF PART I. The Anatomy of the Soft Parts about the Skeleton, which form the subject of this Section, being principally illustrated by recent Specimens, comparatively few Preparations have been collected under this head: these chiefly relate to the Articulations, and the general Anatomy of Muscles. From the importance of the Muscular Tissue, as the prin- cipal agent of Animal Motion, the investigation of its ulti- mate structure has obtained the attention of many dis- tinguished Anatomists and Physiologists, who have by no means agreed in the conclusions at which they have severally arrived. Within the last few years, it has been very gene- rally believed, on the authority of Meckel, Home, Bauer, and Dr. H. M. Edwards, that the Muscular Fibre is ulti- mately composed of globules, combined in a linear arrange- ment. The Editor, and his friend J. J. Lister, when en- gaged in the examination of the Animal Tissues, by the aid of the achromatic compound microscope in the pos- session of this Gentleman, and which, from its superior power, removes some of the optical illusions under which the Anatomists above mentioned, from the nature of their instruments, must necessarily have laboured, were induced to pay particular attention to the Muscular Fibre. The following is extracted from their observations. " The Muscular Tissue may be easily seen with the naked eye, or with the assistance of a comparatively feeble lens, to be composed of bundles of Fibres held together by a loose and fine Cellular Membrane; and these Fibres are again seen to consist of more minute Fibrillar Tt is difficult to push the Mechanical Division much further; for the softness of the Muscular Substance is such, that it is either crushed, or breaks off; rather than admit of further splitting.

The people of all this group of Georgian or Society Islands are exceedingly libidinous. The inhabitants of Tahaa, an island four miles distant from Raiatea, had, till lately, maintained their indepen- dence, and spoken a peculiar language : their disposition is rather morose ; and Christianity, which was forced upon them by Tomatoa, the usurper of Raiatea, has made but little progress among them. The inhabitants of Rurutu are said to be possessed of mild and gentle dispositions. Those of Amanu were addicted to the eating of human flesh, and were much dreaded by their neighbours.

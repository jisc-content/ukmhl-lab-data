OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION XL OF PART I. WiDELY-difFerent degrees of importance in the Animal Economy have, at various periods and by different persons, been attributed to the Fluids, according to the prevalence of a Humoral or an opposite doctrine in the Pathological .systems of the day. This is not the place to enter 'into the merits of the question; yet it may be allowable to re- mark, that the systems of Hoffmann and his followers, which have mainly contributed to raise into importance the previously too-much neglected living solid, have had a natural tendency to divert the attention, perhaps more than was meet, from the alterations in the Fluids to which the older Physicians were wont to attribute so much. The good sense of Practitioners, which has not suffered them to be wholly inattentive to the numerous and striking changes of which the Fluids, especially during disease, are the subject; and the labours of those who have devoted their attention to the cultivation of the comparatively new department of Science, " Animal Chemistry;" have, it is true, rescued the animal Fluids from total neglect. It would seem, that a different state of things is at hand. Both in this country, and on the Continent of Europe, symptoms are observable, which render it by no means improbable, that, in the revolution of Medical doctrines, we are at the dawn of a day in which a Humoral Pathology will again seek to be dominant. Whilst we would depre- cate this extreme, we must admit that much remains to be done; and it can scarcely be doubted, that numerous and important discoveries will reward the zealous inquirer, and form invaluable additions to Physiological and Patho- logical knowledge. We are not yet satisfactorily informed of the differences between Arterial and Venous Blood. Wq

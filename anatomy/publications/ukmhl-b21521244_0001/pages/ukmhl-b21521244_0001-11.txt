( vii ) in the enumeration of what has been done at Guy's Hospi- tal to facilitate the communication of Pathological know- ledge. The spirited and accurate pencil of C.J.Canton, constantly employed in this department for the service of the Hospital, by preserving the recent colours and appear- ances of diseased parts, forms an invaluable supplement to the wet preparations ; which, after the most successful efforts, must often fail in retaining any thing beyond the form and texture. Such are the principal circumstances which have con- curred to give to the Museum of Guy's Hospital, even in its present state, some claims to notice: but it was an object far more important than the exposure either of its poverty or its riches which has prompted the publication of a Catalogue: this was called for, to enable the Pupils who visit the Museum to reap all the benefit and assistance which it may be capable of affording them. When, for this purpose, the formation of a Catalogue was assigned to the Author, it formed a part of his original plan to give not merely a List of the Preparations actually contained in the Collection, but also to insert in their proper order and place in the arrangement, distinguished by a different type, those morbid appearances of which no specimen occurred in the Museum. He conceived that such a ma- nual would be of assistance to those more especially engaged in the study of their profession, and also con- stitute a useful companion to others, who, having entered into practice, are anxious to keep up and extend their ac- quaintance with morbid anatomy by the practice of inspec- tion. With the hope of more completely attaining this object, it was also his intention to give, under the head of each morbid appearance, a reference to the Authors by whom it had been the best described. The lensth of time which the execution of such a plan must unavoidably occupy has induced him for the present to abandon it. It has, therefore, been concluded to publish little more than a simple Catalogue of the Specimens in the Museum. The

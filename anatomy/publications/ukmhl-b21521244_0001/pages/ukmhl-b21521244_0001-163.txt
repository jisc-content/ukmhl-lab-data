It is well known, that Physiologists have never been perfectly agreed in regard to the Chylo-poietic Viscera accessory to the Intestinal Canal. The following humorous Epitaph on the Liver, written by Bartholin, affords a cu- rious illustration of this discordance, with reference to that organ:— SISTE • VIATOR CLAL'DITUR • HOC • TUMULO • QUI • TUMULAVIT PLURIMOS PRINCEPS • CORPORIS • TUI • COCUS ■ ET ARBITER HEPAR • NOTUM • SECULI3 SED IG NOTUM • NATURES QUOD NOMINIS ■ MAJESTATEM • ET • DIGNITATIS FAMA • FIRMAVIT OPINIONE • CONSERVAVIT TAMDIU • COXIT DONEC • CUM • CRIIENTO • IMPERIO • SEIPSUM DECOXERIT.

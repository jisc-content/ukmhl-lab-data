v / ( xii ) The Organs of Generation are divided into two Sections: in the first are placed those of the Female, as the more essential, and those which we first discover in the lowest and most imperfect forms of animal life. Hence the Eighth Section contains the Ovaries, the Fal- lopian Tubes, and the Uterus; then the External Parts; and lastly, as accessories to these organs, the Mammary Glands and Nipples.

Although the Peritoneum affords a covering to many of the organs comprised in the four last sections, it could not with propriety have a place assigned to it in any of them: the Tenth Section is therefore specially devoted to it, and contains the preparations illustrative of the important sub- ject of Hernia. Conception and Utero-gestation form the subject of the Eleventh Section. In the Twelfth are placed Parasitical Animals, under the heads of, Vesicular Worms or True Hydatids, Flat Worms, Cylindrical Worms, and Insects. The Preparations classed under the preceding heads are arranged according to the following Subdivisions, so far as they can be made to apply. The deviation from the normal, healthy, or regular state may take place in several various ways, which have been made the basis of the following arrangement :â€” The first Order contains Specimens in which the devia- tion consists in Deficiency : they are subdivided, 1st, into those in which the deficiency is dependent on suspension of development; and, 2dly, those in which it has been the

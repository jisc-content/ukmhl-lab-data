( * ) and most important use in assisting the Lecturer to convey and the Pupils to receive and understand the descriptions of disease, possess also this advantageâ€”that, as visible and tangible representations of the subjects which they are designed to illustrate, they become valuable helps to the memory, in recalling the ideas which it has received. The first of these advantages they possess individually: but the second, though also in degree possessed by them sepa- rately, is perhaps far more decidedly their collective result. The habit of frequently reviewing, in the same succession, Preparations brought togeth er for the purpose of illustrating the pathology of a particular organ or apparatus, cannot fail to render considerable practical assistance to diagnosis, by enabling the memory rapidly to bring under review the various possible alterations with which the organs suspected of disease may be affected: and whilst we make the choice of that to which the united symptoms appear most de- cidedly to point, we may avoid the danger of overlooking the right one, through inadvertence or forgetfulness. For this reason, it has been thought better to arrange the Specimens in the Museum under the heads of particular systems or apparatus, rather than under those of the ele- mentary tissues. As far as circumstances would admit, the same order has been adopted with the Special and the Pathological Anatomy. The First Section is devoted to the Skeleton; and com- mences with the Vertebral Column, as the most essential part of the skeleton, and the characteristic of that grand division of animals, of which Man is the head. The bones of the Cranium are taken with the Vertebrae; and the Ribs are given as appendages to the Vertebrae, and the Sternum as their counterpart: since it exhibits, though somewhat im- perfectly, the traces of a similar construction. The bones of the upper and lower extremities conclude the section. The Soft Parts about the Skeleton are placed in the Second Section; which includes the Cartilages, Ligaments,

OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION III. OF PART \. Venous branches are distinct in nature and office from the systems of the Thoracic Duct and right Trunk, the old dilemma of Venous or Lymphatic Absorption is avoided by calling in the assistance of a third and new set of ves- sels, the peculiarities and even the existence of which will probably long" afford matter for examination and dis- cussion to Anatomists, before the question can be set at rest. Yet, if their supposed existence and functions be conceded, they must necessarily be regarded as a variety of Venous Radicals; and the theory of Absorption founded upon them must be allowed to bear the closest affinity to the old doctrine of Venous Absorption.

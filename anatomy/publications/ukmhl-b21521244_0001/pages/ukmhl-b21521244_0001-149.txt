OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION V. OF PART I. Although the function, to which the Organs compre- hended in this Section are subservient, constitutes, per- haps, the most important part of what has been called the Tripod of Life, it is not required, by the plan of this work, that much, if any thing, be said respecting them, in this place. A clear and accurate idea of the structure of the Pul- monary Tissue, in its healthy state, is absolutely necessary, to enable us properly to understand many of the impor- tant, and frequently fatal, pathological alterations, of which this structure is the seat. To the want of it must be, in a great measure, attributed the vagueness and disagreement so conspicuous in the writings of those who have treated of the Diseases of the Chest. The work of Reisseissen is justly esteemed one of the best attempts to elucidate this subject; yet part of the views of this author appear, from some examinations made by Dr. Babington and the Editor, to be at least questionable. The work of Dr. Edwards, on the influence which phy- sical agents exert on life, is full of interesting and valuable facts relating to the function of Respiration, and leads to some important practical results. Portal, in the third volume of his " Histoire de l'Ana- tomie et de la Chirurgie," mentions a curious instance of the power of the human voice, in the case of a man who by particular sounds, which he had the art of uttering, was able to break glasses. Savart, a French savant who has recently devoted great attention to the investigation of the properties of sound, has shewn that the same effect may be produced by the violin.

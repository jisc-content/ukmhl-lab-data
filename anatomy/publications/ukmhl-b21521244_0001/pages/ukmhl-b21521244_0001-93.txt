OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION III. OF PART I. Notwithstanding the importance of the Organs com- prised in this Section, very few remarks respecting them appear to be called for in this place. The disposition of the Muscular Fibres of the Heart may be well shewn, by a process which has been attempted in Preparation'; No. 275; and which consists in indurating the Muscular Fibres, and at the same time softening the Cellular Tissue by conti- nued boiling, taking such precautions to secure the form of one or more of the different Cavities as the particular object of the Preparation may require. The arrangement of the Fibres ascertained in this manner was long since well described by Lower; but has been, to a great degree, overlooked or neglected by most succeeding anatomists. A few years ago, the subject was taken up by Dr. Duncan, who, without the knowledge of what Lower had done, completely confirmed, but at the same time added to, the facts which he had made known. The structure of the Arteries presents a question by which Physiologists have been long divided; some contend- ing for their muscularity; others denying them this property. The following extract from the article already alluded to tends to confirm the opinion maintained by the latter. " The Middle Coat of these vessels being still regarded by some persons as muscular, we were desirous of dis- covering whether its minute structure was at all more fa- vourable to such an opinion than its chemical composition. Its subdivision may be carried as far as that of any tissue; arid it evidently consists essentially of long, straight, very delicate, and even Fibres, which offer no more trace of those transverse Stria), which we have regarded as the peculiar characteristic of Muscle, than they do of ele- mentary Globules. .

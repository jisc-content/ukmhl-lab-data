V OltSERVATIONS ON SECTION II. or I'AUT I. Fibrillae last arrived at be placed on a piece of glass in the field of the microscope, lines may be seen parallel to the direction of the Fibre, which shew a still further division into Fibres. Although no trace of globular structure can be detected, innumerable very minute, but clear and fine parallel lines, or Stria?, may be distinctly perceived, trans- versely marking the Fibrillae. In some instances they seem to be continued, nearly or quite at right angles, completely across the Fibril; but frequently the Striae in one part are opposite to the spaces in another, by which arrangement a sort of reticulated appearance is produced. The Striae are not in all specimens equally distant; but this may, per- haps, be owing to the elongation or contraction of the Fibre. We have discovered this peculiar and very beauti- ful appearance in the Muscles of all animals which we have yet examined : and as we have seen it in no other Tissue, we have been induced to view it as a distinguishing feature of Muscle." â€¢ [Vide Philosophical Magazine and Annuls, Aug. 1827.

OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION XI. OF PART I. from those hitherto employed. A camera lucida is adapted to the eye-piece of the microscope, in such a manner, that, the distance of the paper being ascertained, the object may be drawn on a known scale. Tracings of several of the images being made, they were applied to, and compared with, the images of other particles, until their accuracy was established. « The diameter of the particles obtained in this manner may be pretty correctly stated at 5^5 of an inch. " The following measurements, by former observers, are given for the sake of comparison: J urine g^j Jurine, in a second measurement . ^ Bauer . . ... .• . . . • ~-0 Wollaston 6-^, Young 6^0 Kater Di«0 6555 Prevost and Dumas — " The thickness of the particles, which is, perhaps, not so uniform as the diameter of the disks, is, on an average to this latter dimension, as 1 to 4*5 " The form and size of the particles of the Blood of other animals have frequently been compared with those of man. Many observations were made for this purpose by Hewson; but, while some of them appear tolerably ac- curate, others are decidedly far from the truth. Those which have recently been made by Prevost and Dumas are the most extensive and complete which as yet exist. Our attention having been chiefly taken up with the Blood of man, we have not as yet carried our investigation of that of other animals so far as we design doing: we have, however, examined the Blood in all the classes of Verte- brate animals, and in different species of most of them. Our observations completely accord with those of Prevost and Dumas, as to the particles having a circular form in

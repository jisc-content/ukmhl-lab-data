He cannot, however, omit to make it the record of his respectful and grateful acknowledgments to that zealous and enlightened Gentleman, for the very effi- cient and liberal support which, notwithstanding the numerous objects which obtain his attention, he has given to the Museum, and to the other branches of the department committed to the Author's care;—of his sincere regard for the Officers of Guy's Hospital, by whom not only the benevolent views of the Founder, but the interests of Medical Science, are ably promoted;—and, likewise, of his cordial good wishes for the honourable advancement and well-earned prosperity of the Pupils attached to the School.

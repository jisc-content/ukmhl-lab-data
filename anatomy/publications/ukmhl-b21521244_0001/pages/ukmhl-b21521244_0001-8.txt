( iv ) of Guy's Hospital, notwithstanding its comparatively recent formation, may yet be allowed to possess, but also to ex- plain the real motives which have led to the printing of the Catalogue; which, whether publication had been designed or not, it was, for obvious reasons, needful to compose. The first of these objects will probably be best effected by a very brief view of the history of the formation of the Museum. It is self-evident, that every large public Hospital must afford numerous opportunities for the collection of valuable specimens of Pathological Anatomy. This has been par- ticularly the case in the magnificent Institution founded by Thomas Guy, and liberally supported by his ample endowments. Where, as in this Hospital, the Patients are admitted without reference to individual interest, but by a superiority of claim, founded solely on the greater seve- rity and urgency of their particular cases, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that the average of interesting cases must be particularly high. Some idea of the ample field for Pathological Anatomy presented at Guy's Ho- spital may be formed from the following statement of the mortality which has taken place in the Institution during the three last yearsâ€” i From 25th of 3d Month (March) 1825^ to 25th of 3d Month .. 18261 From 25th ditto 1826 to 25th ditto 1827..297 From 25th ditto 1827 to 25th ditto 1828.. 282 The number of beds at present devoted to Patients amounts to 421. It does not appear that any thing beyond the passing advantage was derived from these extensive opportunities, until the present Treasurer, impressed with the importance of securing a more permanent benefit from remarkable Cases that from time to time presented themselves, directed the formation of various Drawings, Models, and Casts. In 1802, if not at a still earlier period, apartments were

( xiii ) result of a loss which lias been sustained. The Second Order embraces deviations consisting in Excess: the Third Order, deviations consisting in perversion of form: the Fourth, Specimens in which the morbid appearance may be regarded as the result of ordinary inflammation: the Fifth, those in which the morbid appearance is regarded as the effect of Scrofula. The Sixth Order comprises numerous adventitious formations, for the most part heterologue ; that is to say, differing more or less from the natural struc- tures of the body: the objects of this Order are marked by a certain degree of uniformity of character, but more par- ticularly by the similarity of the mode of their formation ;â€” most of them have been designated by the term Malignant. This order is subdivided in the following manner: 1st, Specimens exhibiting the adventitious production of Cysts, assuming the form of reflected membranes, often errone- ously called Hydatids, and frequently unaccompanied by constitutional affection. So far as structure is concerned, they are typical of the order in which they are placed. To the Second Division of this Order belong Specimens of True Scirrhus, so far as the distinction can be made, where the natural boundaries are so indistinctly marked as they are between this and some other members of the order. The Third Divisions contains Specimens of that affection known by the names of Fungus Hamiatodes or Medullaris, Me- dullary Sarcoma, Fungoid Disease, Spungold Inflammation, Cerebriform Cancer, &c.: the Fourth, Specimens of Me- lanosis, in that particular form which exhibits a structure resembling the preceding ; and to which the name of Mela- nosis, as descriptive of a specific affection, has been by some restricted. The Seventh Order is composed of Spe- cimens, in which Vesicular Worms, as they have been called, or true Hydatids, are developed in the particular organs which belong to the section. Some explanation may here be necessary, lest it should be thought, that, in violation of received aphorisms on the subject of classification, the same character has been employed to distinguish both a

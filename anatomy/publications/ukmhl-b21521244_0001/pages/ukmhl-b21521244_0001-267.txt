OBSERVATIONS ON SECTION XI. OF PART I. microscope at one time. The particles at these points appear crowded, confused, and misshapen. This tendency to arrangement is, perhaps, not to be wholly attributed to the ordinary attraction existing between the particles of matter, but is, probably, to a greater or less degree, de- pendent on life; since we have not only observed that the aggregating energy is of different force in the Blood of different individuals, but that in the Blood of the same individual it becomes more feeble the longer it has been removed from the body. At the same time, we are very far from believing that these, or any other mode of aggrega- tion which the particles of the Blood may be observed to assume, ought to be regarded as at all analogous to the process which nature employs in the formation of the different tissues." The Editor, in his Thesis, briefly stated this opinion, which he was induced to form dpriori." Pus.—"As far as we have yet examined this secretion, its particles appear to be as irregular in size and figure as those observed in the Brain, and bear no resemblance to those of the Blood." (See the Paper before mentioned.) Milk.—" In this fluid, the particles appear to be perfect globules; but, far from being uniform, they present the most remarkable varieties in respect to size. Whilst some are more than double, others are not a tenth-part of the size of the particles of the Blood, to which they bear no resemblance." (See the Paper before mentioned.)

PREFACE. XIV their youth moving in dignity and grace: For there were feen in mixed affembly in their women, the pureft models of female beauty j—-in their young men, the grandeft difplays of the manly form ; moving and in adtion ; infpired by every noble emulation, exulting in their ftrength ; or advancing into the public view, only to lliow the beauties of their form. Their artifts needed no helps of anatomy ; but in thofe delightful fpetflacles colleded all the modes and forms of beauty, to combine them into one high ideal form. * The moderns have come poorly after, in this great career; copy- ing coldly thofe half-animated forms, which are feen in our fchools of the arts fixed in laborious poflures, “ felling their igno- “ ble beauty for a price.” Senfible of this great defedt, our artifts have taken the help of anatomy to corredt this tame unmeaning form; ftudying with a noble perfeverance, (but as their own critics acknowledge to us,) with but poor fuccefs. They ftudy each muf- cle ; they note down its diredtion and ufe ; they guefs at its office, and power in certain poflures of the body ; and try to mark it in its juft place. The modern ftatuary, is like one wandering a- mong the ruins of fome noble city, who finding the remains of a temple, traces its lines among the ruins, and, upon this flender knowledge, tries to imagine and coldly reprefent to us its loft -form and antient grandeur. It * “ We are taught by philofophy, the natural pre-eminence and high rank of fpecific ideas u above individual forms.”—. Harris.

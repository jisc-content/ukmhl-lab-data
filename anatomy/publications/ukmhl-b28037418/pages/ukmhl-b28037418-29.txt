PREFACE. xv It was thus that Michael Angelo fiudied our profefTion : and ftudied it fo, that the lefibns of that great mailer are a reproach to thofe who profefs anatomical knowledge. His knowledge of ana- tomy gave to all his works a call “ approaching more nearly to “ the Etrufcan Ryle, than to the purer taRe of the Greeks marking them too hardily with traits of learning. His violent di- Rortions and fudden fhortenings of the limbs are lefs pleafing to thofe who delight in the delicate and higher beauty; fitting him lefs for reprefenting the female form, than for giving bold and terrible pictures of aCtion and Rrength. But Rill he is correCt and true in all that belongs to the anatomy of the human body ; and his Rudies are atrial of the anatomiR’s fkill;—for in looking upon one of thefe, we find that the knee, the ancle, the neck, the wriR, each head and projecting point of bone, is truly marked; while the difiortion of the figure, the violent aCtion of the limbs, the diorten- ings and bending of the joints, and the intricacy of the whole poRure are difficult in the extreme; but Rill each limb is true, and every individual mufcle fwelling in its juR degree, fo as to preferve correCtly the proportions and balance of the whole. Should not we be afliamed to compare our languid endeavours with the perfedl knowledge of this great painter, the very notes of whofe deeper Rudies in anatomy we are unable to read ? But in our profeffion, though the very fciencemight almofl be de- fined a knowledge of parts, indufiry and knowledge are but of low 2 repute.

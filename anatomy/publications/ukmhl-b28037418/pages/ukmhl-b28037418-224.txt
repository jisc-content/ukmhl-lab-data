Olf THE MUSCLES. *34 tions, which are marked fo dark that they can be uuderftood only by the indigita- tions (a a a) of the Serratus Major Anticus Mufcle, in the interftices of which they rife. The belly of this mufcle covers only the fide, flops fuidenly at (b b), which reprefent the flat tendon, the fibres of which go obliquely from above downwards and in- wards, whence it is named Obliquus Descenders. The letters (ccc) fhow the line which is called Linea Semi-lunaris ; and the letters are fo placed, as alfo to point out the interfeftions or tendinous lines which divide the Refti, or ftraight mufcles of the Abdomen, into four or five diftinft bellies; and confequently the letters (ccc) alfo mark the feveral bellies of the Reft us, fhining through the thin expanded tendon of the External Oblique. ("*) Marks the head of the Reftus Mufcle, where it rifes from the border of the Thorax, touching the Pectoral MuscLe (69.), and at the place of this mark (*), the mufcle is uncovered of its fheath ; this mark ferves alfo another ufe, for it is repeated again below near the navel, fo that thefe two marks Crow the whole length of the Linea Alba, or white line, which is feen running down all the center of the belly from the Sternum quite to the Pubis, palling through the navel, and formed by the meeting of the tendons'of all the mufcles. And it is perhaps worth notice, that the fmall holes marked very dark, which a’-e neat, fmall, and round, and which appear in every difieftion, like Oilet Holes, and are efpe- cially frequent over the furfaces of the Refti Mufcles, are juft the openings by which the great Cutaneous Veins of the Abdomen pierce the flat tendon of the External Oblique Mufcle, to get to the bellies of the Mufcles which lie under it, or rather to come back from them, returning chiefly the blood of the Epigaftric Artery f. The T 1 queftion whether it be not truely a wound of one of thefe large veins, (and they are greatly •dilated in dropfy of the belly), which occafions that kind of bleeding, which fo often happens in tapping the belly.

BOOK SECOND, PLATE FIRST. 85 eye-lids, and comprefs the eye, till tears begin to How. And the corner of the mouth, which is thus raifed in laughter, is diftorted in pride, malice, hatred ; is dilated and drawn backwards in rage ; drops lower in grief ^ and in palfy falls quite down. Thefe movements round the angle of the mouth, are the chief indications in the face itfelf, while all other indications of paffion, proceed rather from the general fyftem, A healthy body, and chearful mind, have the face full, the eye humid, the limbs braced, the whole body free, and light moving. In languid health, or under afflic- tion and care, the face is pale, the eye cold, the whole body languid and relaxed and fo it is in paffion, for the medical arrangement of the paffions is nearly correct. There are two great clafles of paffions, the exciting and the depreffing paffions ; in the exciting paffions, as joy or anger, the heart beats high ; the face is turgid ; the eye prominent and fparkling ; the mufcles are tenfe ; the limbs braced ; the whole body is in a moveable, a&ive, and highly excited Hate. But when the heart beats languid in grief, or palpitates with fear, the face becomes pale, the features fink, the limbs tremble, the whole frame is unbraced, cold, and unapt for motion; and from thefe general conditions of the fyftem refult all thofe other marks of paffion, which accompany the changes of the face ; for in grief, fear, defpair, the blood ebbs, and the face is pale, and the features fink ; while in anger the face is red, the eye brows corrugated, and the eye turgid and {trained ; but in rage, the whole mufcular frame is {trained toward the molt violent adtion, the breath is retained, while the pulfe beats high ; and fo the face becomes turgid, the eye is fiery and red, there is a grinding of the teeth, the angles of the mouth are {trained backwards, the noftrils are raifed and dilated, the Buccinator, Zygomatic, Mafieter, and Temporal Mufcles are in violent action, which gives an Angular and Linear hardnefs to all the features and faliva and foam proceed from the univerfal preffiire upon all the glands.

OF THE BONES. ■24 4. The Alveolar Process, or that projecting femicircle, which holds the teeth; thence named Alveolar, or Socket Procefs. 5. The Palate Plate, or Procefs ; of which we fee the rough edge only, viz. that edge by which the Middle Palate Suture, the future in the roof of the mouth, is formed. V. B. The Palate Flate is feen full in Plates IV. V. and VI. 6. The Antrum Maxillare, or Higmorianum. This great cavity appears with a ve- ry wide opening here in the naked bone ; but this opening is covered in the entire fcull, both by the lower fpongy bone, and by the nafal plate of the palate bone. This nafal plate of the palate bone is left in this drawing covering a part of the An- trum ; the reft of this opening is naturally covered by a membrane, which leaves but one fmall hole. The Nafal Plate of the Palate Bone which is left fticking upon the Antrum is mark- ed (a). « (3) Marks the only Hole of the Upper Jaw Bene. It is named the Infra-Orbitary Hole. A chief nerve of the face comes out here, named (with its hole) the Infra- Orbitary Nerve. The proper Infra-Orbitary Hole is marked (3) ; and the Canal by which the nerve comes down is marked (cj : at this place the nerve lies under the eye, upon the floor of the orbit,—making a very large groove and hole upon this Orbitary Plate of the Upper Jaw Bone ; for arteries running along bones do not make deeper grooves than the nerves do. t N> B.

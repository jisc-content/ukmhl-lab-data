331 PREFACE. I know but too well that few will fubmit to learn anatomy, as they fhould do, by the dry reading of anatomical defcriptions, and the tedious comparing of thefe with the fubjedl, or with their plates; and there are very few, who have learned this ufeful truth, that they are to become acquainted with parts only by being mafters of the whole.

It is according to the mufcles, that all the other parts are to be defcribed; for when we trace the courfe of a blood veffel, it is by purfuing its intricate wan- derings among the mufcles: it gives its firft branch to one mufcle, its fecond branch to another; it forks into two, under the belly of a third; it goes through the fubflance of a fourth mufcle, or ac- companies its tendon, or runs along the edge of its flefhy belly : So that in defcribing a great vefifel, we mark its exit from the trunk . / of the body, its entrance into the arm-pit or groin, its courfe down the arm or thigh ; the dangers! the wounds, the operations of each great artery or nerve, are recorded according to the parts which their

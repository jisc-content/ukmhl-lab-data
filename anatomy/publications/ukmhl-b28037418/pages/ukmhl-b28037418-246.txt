T5Â° OF THE MUSCLES. Anus. The Tranfverfalis Perinsei mull be fairly cut acrofs ; the Accelerator will be fpared ; the Eredlor cannot be cut; and the operator who cuts the Accele- rator, keeps his knife too near the Anus, and wounds the bulb. The operator who fpeaks of cutting the Eredlor, either mull be very ignorant of this fame Erec- tor, or mull intend to cut upon the Tuberofity of the Ifchium, hoping perhaps to cut through the bone : But what Ihall we think of a furgeon, who fpeaks about things of this kind fo loofely, as to talk of cutting both the Eredtor and the Acce- lerator Mufcle ; that is of cutting both that mufcle which lies on the outlide of the common incilion, and alfo that one which lies on the inlide of the common incilion ? After reading this in any author, one might be inclined to turn backwards a page or two, to fee whether he made an incifion like that of Celfus; viz. in the Ihape of a half-moon. PLATE

<©F TH£ JOINTS. dyles. It grows bread at its root, being there fo large as to fill up all the empty fpace in the joint. It aflumes at its lower part a triangular or prifmatic form, with one flat fide dire&ly forwards, and the other angle of the prifm looking backwards in the joint, and covering the crucial ligaments which lie in the back part of the cavi- ty. After enlarging at its bafis, it degenerates into a foft mucous or mem- branous covering for the fat and mucous glands ; thus it is connected at its root with the lower edge of the patella ; with the fat and mucous fringes, and with the fore horns of the Semilunar Cartilages. So that this ligament moves in every mo- tion of the joint, as the thigh-bone from which it rifes moves, it is moved the more from its connection with the patella, and as this ligament moves along with the patella, it in its turn moves the Semilunar Cartilages and the bundles of fat, and keeps them fixed, or draws them forwards; for were the fat permitted to move back- wards, it would be bruifed direCtly betwixt the bones with a force that would deftroy it; and thus the mucous duCts not only by the elafticity of the fat which furrounds them, ftart out from betwixt the bones when they prefs too clofely ; but the fat toge- ther with all the glands which belong to it is fo held forward by this mucous liga- ment as to lie always in the free and open part of the joint. This ligament was thought by the ancients to be fometimes wanting, though this cannot be true of a part fo eflfential to the found conftitution and free motions of the joint. It is believed by fome, that it may be torn in fudden and violent bendings of the knee ; it furely is the part the moil fubjeCt to difeafe, fince we find it in ulcerated joints quite coroded. It is plain that this part muft be moll peculiarly .fubjeCt to inflame, fince it is continually working in every motion of the joint; it is not only delicate in itfelf,but is connected with all the more delicate parts ; for the in- ner membrane of the capfule is continuous with this Mucous Ligament; the fat that furrounds the patella is continuous with it ; it conduCts the fringes or duCts of the chief mucous glands; it is itfelf a fecreting furface, and the moveable or Semilunar Carti- lages

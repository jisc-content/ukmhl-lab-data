OF THE MUSCLESr 5H FIRST ROW. , \ > .... .. The firft row gives the parts Angle and entirely diflfeXed; and there is reprefented^ (i.) The Os Hyoides, which refembles in its general form the lower Jaw Bone of sfe child, or what is called the Thought Bone of a fowl ; (a) is its bafis, ([b) its horn, (c) the Cartilaginous joinings of the horns and body, , and two little Tubercles ftand perpendicularly up at the place of this joining,, which are called the Cornua Minora or lefler horns, or Appendices of the Os Hyoides. Thefe Cor- nua Minora are here reprefented in outline. The Os Hyoides is named alfo the bone of the Tongue, and its connexions are efpecially to be obferved, viz. that it lies in the root of the tongue ; forms in a manner the top piece of the Trachea,„ is tied by a membrane to the Thyroid Cartilage, has the Epiglottis (5.) or valve of the windpipe planted upon it. And that thefe connexions may be underftood, this bone is marked with this figure (1.) in all the other drawings. (2.) Is the Thyroid or Shield-like Cartilage ; which is indeed the Afield of the Throat, for it is broad, flat, and very deep, and a full inch in length ; it is thick, and often ofiified. And accordingly it is this broad Cartilage that defends the more delicate parts; its upper horns (dd), are tied to the Gs Hyoides by a long liga- ment ; its lower ones («) clofely embrace the Cricoid Cartilage. In this drawing, the Cartilage is fet fo as to reft upon its two lower Cornua, and,to fupport and bal- lance it a common pin marked (*), was thruft into its (3.) Is the Cricoid Cartilage; v.'hich is not, like the Thyroid, a femicircle merely, i. e. wanting at the back part, but is an entire ring which forms,, as it were,, the uppermoft and firmeft ring of the Trachea, but which ftill belongs properly to the Larynx. It is {hallow before, and very deep in the back part of its circle, plainly for the purpofe of rafting the Arytenoid Cartilages, (thofe fmall Cartilages which-

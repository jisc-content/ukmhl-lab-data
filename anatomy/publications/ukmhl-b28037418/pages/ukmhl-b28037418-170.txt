And the common membrane of the Trachea is continued from the Os Hyoides, to the Thyroid Cartilage, fo that the gap betwixt them is filled up by a ftrong, but thin membrane (7). (2.) The Thyroid Cartilage is next, it Hands forwards in the throat to defend the other parts ; is diftinCtly felt without; is. the molt prominent part of the throat; and named Pomum Adami. Â£3.) Is the Cricoid Cartilage, which in this profile of the throat, is feen to be very Ihallow before, as it is deep behind; The Arytenoid Cartilages, (4.) are neceffarily hidden in this view; and the Epi- glottis (5.) is cut away, to m..i^^his drawing more fimple and eafy. The Thyroid Gland is marked (6.) the chief part of it is feen on the nearer fide of the Trachea, and a part alfo of the right lobe is feen coming round from the other fide behind the Trachea, and almoft furrounding it.

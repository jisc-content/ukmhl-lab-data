BOOK THIRP, FtA.TR THIRD, PLATE III. Tbit Platt explaint the Text Booh, from Page 443, to Page 43 J. The Anatomy of the knee-joint is continued in this plate. It explains the internal parts, the knowledge of which is more valuable than of the external parts, in proportion as internal difeafes of this joint are more frequent than luxations, which never happen except in thofe ter- rible injuries, where all the foft parts belonging to the joint, are en- tirely torn up by the roots, fo that the limb cannot be faved. The chief parts to be obferved within the joint are the fat, and Mucous Membranes, which lubricate the joint, the Ligaments or Frenuke, which order and regulate the motions of thefe fatty mafles and fringes., the Semi-lunar Cartilages which, like fridion-wheels facilitate the motions of the joint; and Laftly, the great Crucial Ligaments by which the joint is ftrengthened within, the Crucial Ligaments alone being ftronger than the whole of thofe Ligaments which are to be feen on the outiide of the joint. 1. The Fat. The fat which is for lubricating the knee-joint, though it is not entirely confined to the circle of the Patella, yet it chiefly furrounds it; and with the fat there are Z 2 many

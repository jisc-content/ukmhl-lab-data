OF THE JOINTS. In thefe three drawing?, all the internal parts of the knee-joint are explained. !. The Fat which is collected chiefly round the Patella, which perhaps does not exude nor mix with the fluid of the joint, but ferves rather by its Lubricity and Elaftic ' nature, to conduit and defend the fringes or Mucous Duds. 2. The Mucous Ligament, which is the firft part that is feen upon opening the joint ; â– which lies in the center of the joint; is of a foft and mucous nature ; conduits many of the Mucous Fringes ; and which, defending from the middle of the thigh bone betwixt the Condyles, is attached to the lower edge of the Patella, and to the Semi-lunar Ligaments, and fo it moves along with the Patella, and moves in its turn the Cartilages and the fat. It regulates the motions of the Cartilages, and it draws forwards the fat, preventing it going backwards, fo as to be bruifed betwixt the bones. 3. The Semi-lunar Cartilages, which are like the labels which are put round the neck of a wine flalk. They are tied at the horns by ligaments, as the label is hung by its chain ; lie flat upon the Tibia, to facilitate its motions, and enable, at the fame time, the Condyles of the thigh bone to change their centers of motion, according to the various poftures of the joint. 4. The Cross Ligaments, which are very thick, and ftrong, lie chiefly in the back part of the joint, and by their going the one over the face of the Tibia, and the other down along the back of the bone, they limit both its motions, the one checking it in too violent bendings of the knee, the other limiting its extenfions. So that the motions forwards and backwards* are limited by thefe Crofs Ligaments within the joint, while it is fecured from irregular Lateral motions by the ftrong Lateral Ligaments without. FIGURES /

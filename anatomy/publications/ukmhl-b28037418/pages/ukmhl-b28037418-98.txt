OF THE BONES. 42 ing the Frontal Sinus or cavity, (i.) The cavity or finus itfelf, with a crofs bar in it, as there commonly is. B The Inner Surface of the Parietal Bone; with the Artery of the Dura Mater, or rather its impreflion or furrow ieen. C The Inner Surface of the Occipital Bone ; where (V) marks the Winding Groove of the Lateral Sinus ; (/") that Groove ending in the thimble-like cavity, and the thimble-like cavity ending in its turn in the Foramen Lacerum, by which the finus gets out; and there paffes along with it through this wfide flit, the Par Vagum, or eighth pair of nerves. Qr) Marks the thicknefs of the bone, at the place of the Crucial Pddge ; (&) its thinnefs, where it is loaded and prefled by the lobes of the brain, (z) Shows the feftion of the Foramen Magnum, (i) Marks the Cuneiform Procefles of the Occipital and Sphcenoidal Bones *. D Marks the Temporal Bone, where (/) points out the Foramen Auditorium Inter- num, where the Auditory Nerve enters; and («z) marks the Styloid Procefs. G Marks the Upper Jaw Bone, where it forms the Palate. H Marks the Lower Jaw Bone, where (n) is the fection, Ihowing the Cancelli of the Low’er Jaw ; (o) is the angle ; and here upon the internal furface of the angle, the Pteregoid Mufcle is implanted ; (jC>) the hole by which the proper nerve of the Lower Jaw, the inferior Maxillary Nerve, gets into the heart of the bone; and there going round, accompanied with an artery, a branch of each is given off to every tooth; and what remains of the Nerve and Artery after this, comes out by the Mental hole upon the chin. The curious parts feen in this fection are;—The Cells, Spongy Bones, and the Eus- tachian Tube. The * There are two Foramina Lacera or wide holes, one belonging to the Sphoenoid Bone, in the bot- tom of the focket for the eye ; and this one betwixt the Temporal and Occipital Bones, in the bails of the Sull over the neck or implantation cf the vertebras.

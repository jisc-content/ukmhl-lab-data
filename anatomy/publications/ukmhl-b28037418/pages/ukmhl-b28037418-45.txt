BOOK FIRST, PLATE FIRST, is merely a ring; is fixed to the bone only, and not joined with it; and is here feen covered with the fmooth Membrane of the Tympanum, or Drum of the Ear. E The Cheek Bone ; which, like all the other bones, is very round, and its edges blunt and ill defined. F The Small Bones of the Nofe. G The Upper Jaw Bone; where, fince the teeth are not yet come up, the Alveolar or Socket Procefs is not formed, nor even marked. H The Lower Jaw Bone; where alfo the Alveolar Procefs is wanting, and where the branch of the jaw bone does not rife from the bafis, or lower line, with a bold and acute angle, but goes obliquely off, more horizontal, and more in the fame dire&ion with the reft of the bone. And laftly, the chief point to be obferved, in the fcull of a child, is the open*, ings of the head ; for the parietal bone is fo incomplete round all its edges, that it leaves all the futures imperfect and membraneous, and leaves fome open- ings particularly large, (a a a a) mark the four corners of the greater opening upon the top of the head; which, from the hypothefis of its ferving as a drain, is called the Fontanelle, or Fountain of Moifture. It has four angles, is formed by four eroding futures ; the Sagittal Suture, defcending quite to the nofe. The Fontanelle is covered only with a thin and delicate membrane ; it is named the Greater Anterior, or True Fontanelle, the opening of the head. (b) Marks

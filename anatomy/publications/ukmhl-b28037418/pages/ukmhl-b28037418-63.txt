BOOK FIRST, PLATE THIRD. 19 3. (jltf) The two upper Spongy Bones ; they are named fpongy, from their conflitution, for they confiA of cells ; they are called OiTa Spongiofa Superiora, to diAinguiAi them from two fimilar bones, which hang in the lower part of the Nofe. They are fpoken of as diitinct bones, while they are but parts of the (Ethmoid Bone. 4. (e) The Orbitary Plate of the (Ethmoid Bone ; which, as it is inclofed a- mong the other bones of the Orbit, feems to be a diftinfl: bone furrounded by a peculiar future, and fo is named the Os Planum ; though it is merely the flat fide of the (Ethmoid Bone. 5. (f) Marks the place where the Os Unguis fliould be feen; but it is pulled away to fliow the numerous cells of the (Ethmoid Bone. Thefe cells are divided into two fets, one fet attached to the Orbitary Plate, or flat fquare fide of the (Eth- moid Bone, the other fet to the Spongy Bone. 6. (g) Figure IV. (hows that fet of the cells, which more particularly belongs to the Spongy Bone, and Figure III. fiiows the cells opened from above, to give a view of thofe, which more particularly belong to the Orbitary Plate. Whatever farther is necefiary to the demonftration of the (Ethmoid Bone, is to be. found in Plates V. and VI. where the cells are particularly well explained- FIGURE V. and VI.. Explain the Sphoenoid, Pteregoid, or Wedge-like Bone ; it is named Pteregoid from its refemblance to a bat, and is fo prefented here, as to fuggeft the likenefs. C 2 Figure.

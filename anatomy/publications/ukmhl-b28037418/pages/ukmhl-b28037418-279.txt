BOOK. THIRD, PLATE SECOND. I 75 by faying a that there are two Internal Ligaments belonging to this joint, viz. the s< great Internal Central, or round ligament as it is called, and thefe fmaller “ Mucous Ligaments.” (9.) Is the root of the Burfal Ligament, for it embraces not merely the head, but alfo the neck of the bone; and it is here explained how the Perioileum Co), which 9 is feen torn up from the fhaft of the thigh bone, goes off from the bone at Qp), in the form of Burfal Ligament, fo that the Burfal Ligament and the Perioileum are continuous, being different modifications of one membrane. FIGURES III. and IV. Are drawings of the outfide of the knee-joint, for explaining the General Capfule of the joint, and efpecially for explaining the ftrengthenings of the Capfule, which are known by the names of Lateral and Poflerior Ligaments. Figure III. Ihows the inner fide of the knee-joint, with the great Internal Lateral Ligament, (a) Marks the thigh bone ; (b) the Tibia, and the letter is placed upon that bump, which receives the tendon of all the Extenfor Muffles ; (c) the Patella appearing through the tendinous expanlions which cover all the joint. There is left here a part of the flelh^ belly of the Vaftus Interims Muffle (174.). This belly expands into the form of a thin tendinous faffia, which goes over the common. Capfule of the joint sit (cl), to ftrengthen it. It is at (e), that the broad tendon of the Vaftus Internus is inferted into the Patella ; and (f) is the ftrong Ligament of the Patella, which comes clown from the pointed lower end of the Patella, which though it is called Ligament, is merely the thick and tough tendon by which all the muffles, which extend the leg, as the Rectus, Vasti, and Crur^us, are fixed into the knob (3), upon the head of the Tibia. (g) Marks that margin of the head of the Tibia upon which the Semi-lunar Cartilage plays, and this lharp edge iS'

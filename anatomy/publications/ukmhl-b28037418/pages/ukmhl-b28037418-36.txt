PREFACE. xxu tion is but one extremity forfooth, or one portion of a part, which having other pofterior extremities, or anterior portions, has to pafs {till through a long declenlion of thefe curious terms, which have-not, like the terms in any other fcience, the property of conveying more regular and clear ideas, nor of faving fuperfluous words. They Hand in place of the Ample expref- fion of upper or lower ends.—Now this clutter of hard names confounds the ear, as well as puzzles the judgement of the ftudent, and is truely a dif- grace to the fcience it looks as if we believed Anatomy to con Aft in ftrange terms, and that we could not write in true character of Anatomifts, but by departing as widely as pofiible from the language of gentlemen. I have ventured, inftead of “ fetting up this rank and file of tall opaque words “ betwixt the reader’s imagination, and my own conceptions,” to make every defcription as Ample as may be,—-ufing no hard words, but the pure names ; choofing rather that my book fliould be plainly underftood, than admired as a piece of unintelligible profound anatomy.

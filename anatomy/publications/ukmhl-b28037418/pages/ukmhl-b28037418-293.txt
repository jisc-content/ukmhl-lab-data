187 BOOK THIRD, PLATE THIRD. FIGURES IV. AND V. Explain the Ligaments of the ancle joint, and of the foot. All the great Ligaments belonging to the ancle joint, or 10 the Tarfal Bones are drawn in figure iv. and in figure V. are feen the two great ligaments lying in the foie of the foot. FIGURE IV. 'TP . . . . * JL HE Ligaments belonging to the ancle joint are thel'e, (1.) A ftrong Ligament tying the Fibula to the Tibia. It is large and very ftrong ; commonly it is divided, as here, into two, fometimes into three flips ; fometimes they all adhere. It is named the Ligamentum Anticum Superius. There is on the back part of the Fibula a ligamentous membrane, which is like this one, and is nam- ed Ligamentum Fibulae Pofticum Superius. Thefe ligaments conneft the Tibia and Fibula fo firmly to each other, that they are as one bone with two procefles, viz. the inner and outer ancles. (2.) Is the Middle Perpendicular Ligament, a very ftrong ligament, which de- fcends dire&ly from the point of the outer ancle, to tie it firmly to the fide of the Os Galcis. There are three ligaments tying the outer ancle to the foot ; viz. firft, this middle one ; fecond, the anterior one; and, third, one behind the joint, a pofterior ligament, which is not feen. This Middle Perpendicular Liga- ment, fo named from its pofition, defcends direflly from the very point of the outer ancle, and it is implanted into the fide of the heel bone. It holds the an- cle from yielding to one fide, and from bending too much ; aflifting rather the pof- terior ligament than the anterior one. It lies clofe upon *the Capfule, and ftrength- ens it; while the tendons of the Peronaei Mufcles glide and rub acrofs it. (3-) Tiie A a 2

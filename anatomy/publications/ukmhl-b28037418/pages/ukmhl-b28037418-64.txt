20 OF THE BONES. 8. The Figure ,V. fhows the back view of the bone, viz. that which is turned towards the fcullFigure VI. fhows the front view, viz. that which is conneded with the bones of the face. Its Processes are, L The Alae, or wings, commonly named the Temporal Procefles, for they lie in the Temples ; the Temporal Mufcles lie upon them, and their upper edge is fquamous like the edge of the Temporal bone, and forms part of the Squamous Suture. â– % 2. Marks that fmooth furface of this Temporal Process, which, being turned to- wards the eye, enters into the Orbit, and fo is named the Orbitary Procefs of the Sphcenoid Bone. 3. The fmall and fliarp Spinous Process. 4. The hook-like point of the Spinous Procefs, which is often named the Styloid Pro- cefs. 5. The External Pteregoid Processes ; which are two flat and broad plates. 6. The two internal Pteregoid Processes ; which Hand off a little higher, and more direft from the body of the bone; they are fmaller ; and terminate in a little hook. The Pteregoid Mufcles, which go to the lower jaw, arife from the procefles themfelves ; and the Tensor Palati Muscle turns round this little hook. 7. The Azygous, or Angle Procefs; which is Angle, becaufe it Hands out from the middle of the bone. It forms part of the partition for the Nofe, and is thence named Nasal Process.

PREFACE. xxi 1 have endeavoured, alfo, to keep the explanation of thefe plates to the moil Ample and natural form; knowing, by long experience, that anato- mical defcriptions are, even to the molt earned and diligent ftudent, very tedious and hard to be underftood. The loading of fuch a ftudy as Anatomy with peculiar or afFedted language, and with needlefs terms of art, where too many are really needful, has a tawdry and vulgar appearance, of which we have much reafon to be alhamed ; it is a barbarous jargon, to which our ear is fubdued only by long and inveterate cuftom : and our continual ufe of this traffiy language in fchool books, prefents to the flu- dent the difficult and harrafllng talk of learning at once a new fcience and a ftrange language. Swift, who commends fimplicity of language, and enforces his leftbm by the moil beautiful examples, fays, â€œ When the water is clear you will 11 eafily fee to the bottombut anatomifls have ftirred up their techni- cal terms fo thick, that the ftudent has but a poor chance of feeing to the bottom, unlefs we fhall agree in letting this fediment quietly fubfide a^, gain. The medical ftudent is, indeed, fo accuflomedto hard words, that he can fcarcely think any book accurate or complete that is without them; and however well he may underfland iPs defcriptions, cannot believe them true. He is not only accuflomed to know the molt difficult parts by the hardefl names, but to have the detail given to him in fuch expletives, as the Pofterior, Anterior, Superior, Inferior *; and often after all, this Superior Anterior por- tion * Our 'fcie'nce in this country has got this vile farrago, of Anterior, Superior, &c. through tad tranflations of Latin and French, where fuch words as Superieure or Superior are in their place.

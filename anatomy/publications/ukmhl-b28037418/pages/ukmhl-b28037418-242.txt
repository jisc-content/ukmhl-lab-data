The parts pointed out along with the Diaphragm marked (145.) are parts of the Tranfverfe mufcles of the Abdomen, which, being internal mufcles and riling from the inner furface of the Thorax, have their tongue-like origins (nr a a), which come from the ribs, mixed confufedly with (b b b), the tongue-like origins of the great mufcle of the Diaphragm, which tongue-like origins (b b~) come from the fame ribs ; and it was from this connexion with the two Tranfverfe Mufcles of the Abdomen, that the Diaphragm was once reckoned a Trigaftric Mufcle; V^id. Book of the Mufcles, page 315. (1.) The greater, or upper mufcle of the Diaphragm, has thefe five origins ; on both > ^ b fides (iditd) mark the flelh which rifes from the ribs, from the inner furface of the Thorax, indigitated with the origins of the Tranfverfe Mufcle; (e e) mark the two backmoft portions of the great Anterior Mufcle, and thefe two portions rife from the two Ligaipenta Arcuata, which flretch over the origins of the Quadratus Lumborum and Psoas Mufcles. And (y) marks a fifth portion of the greater mufcle, which rifes from the inner furface of the Sternum and Xiphoid Cartilage. (2.) The lefier mufcle rifes by four tendinous feet from the fore-part of the Lumbar Vertebrae ; and thefe, the Crura Diaphragmatis (gg), which furround the trunk of the Aorta, and their tendinous feet (hhh) are very fairly reprefented here, for they are not nicely cut and pared into diftinft feet, but are reprefented as they are taken up from the face of the Lumbar Vertebrae ; that is, not in the fliape of 3

J^Erresent the fore and back views of the Thigh Bone.—And in order that the letter prefs may proceed in the regular order of a little defcription or demonftration, the fmall figures are put upon each drawing; fo that any number that is wanting on one drawing, mull be found on the other. The First Figure fhows the Back Part of the Thigh Bone, which is marked by our feeing here, from behind, the length of the neck of the bone;—the manner of its riling out of the two great proceffes, the Trochanters ;—the proje&ion and roughnefs of the Linea Afpera, and the deep hollow betwixt the Condyles. The Second Figure, or the fore view, is exceedingly fimple, having no ftrong marks. The Linea Afpera is turned almoll out of fight. The chief peculiarity of the fore view is, that it fhows the bending form of the bone.

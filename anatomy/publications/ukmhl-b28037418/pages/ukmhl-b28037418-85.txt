BOOK FIRST, PLATE FIFTH 37 (v) is the Ridge betwixt thefe two hollows, which rifes very high, is called the Internal Spine of the Occipital Bone, and has a fmall falx (Tomewhat like the larger onej attached to it. (w) Marks the Foramen Lacerum, or wide irregular hole betwixt the Temporal and Occipital Bones, through which the Lateral Sinus paffes to go down into the neck, where it forms the Great Internal Jugular Vein. And the 8th pair of nerves, or Par Vagum accompanies the vein through this hole.— (x) Stands upon the very middle of the Cuneiform or Wedge-like Procefs of the Occipital and Sphoenoidal Bones ; for the two bones meet here, without any de- termined or regular limits for either.—And (y) Hands in the center of the Foramen Magnum, by which the Spinal Marrow goes dawn into the canal of the Spine. FIGURE II. HP a his drawing explains the Balls of the Scull, as it is turned towards the neck and throat. But this furface is fo rough,, irregular, and confufed, that it will not bear that fair ar- rangement and complete enumeration of procefles which the firft figure bears. The furfaces chiefly to be obferved, and.which may ferve in fome degree to arrange the fubjeft, are 1ft. The Jaw and Palate Bones, id, The Root of the Temporal Bones. 3d, The Lower Part of the Occipital Bones. 1. About the Palate we obferve, (a) The Alveolar Procefs of the upper Jaw Bone, robbed of many of its teeth ; (l) the Palate Plate of the Upper Jaw Bone, forming a chief part of the roof of the mouth ; (c) the Palate Plate of the proper Palate Bone, which forms nearly one third of the Palate ; (d~) the Tranfverfe Palate Suture, which runs acrofs the Palate, joining the Palate Bone to the Palate Procefs of the Jaw Bone ; (e) the Middle or Longitudinal Palate Suture, which joins the bones of the oppofite fides ; (J~) the Foramen Incifivum, or Anterior Palatine Hole, lying juft behind the firft cutting teeth, and common to both bones ; (g) the pofterior Palatine Hole, which permits the

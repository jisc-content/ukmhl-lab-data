47 BOOK FIRST, PLATE SEVENTH FIGURE FIGURE III. ThE Cervical Vertebra has thefe chief chara&ers, (i.) The body is fmall, firm, and of more folid and condenfed bone than in the vertebrae of the loins or back. (2.) The Articulating Procefs is truely oblique. (3.) The Spinous Procefs is Ihort, and is forked. (4.) The Tranfverfe Procefs is fhort, forked, and has a large hole in it for a great artery of the brain, which by its palling through this canal of the vertebrae is named Verte- bral Artery. SECOND ROW. This Row explains chiefly the conneftions of the Vertebrae. FIGURE IV. uHows the manner in which one Dorfal Vertebra fits down upon another, fo that the Articulating Proceffes (2. 2.) check upon one another, and the Spinous Procefles (3, 3) are feen to be long and aquiline, and lying fo over each other as to prevent all motion backwards or forwards, while the ribs limit the motion to either fide. But in this drawing the one Spinous Procefs is tilted up from the other a little, owing to- the want of that intervertebral fubfiance which Ihould lie betwixt the bodies. The hole is feen here at (d) betwixt the two vertebrae, by which a nerve goes off at the in- terftice between each Vertebra : fo there are in all twenty-four nerves of the Spine, correfponding with the number of Vertebrae in the Spine.

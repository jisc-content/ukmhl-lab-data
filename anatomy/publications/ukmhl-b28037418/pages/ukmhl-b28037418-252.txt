ICJ4 OF THE MUSCLES. The firft and fecor.d heads of the Triceps, (161.) are feen from behind. The Semi-membranosus (178.) is next feen ; but the whole of it is not feennothing 13 bare here but the middle and lower parts of the mufcle ; but there is enough of it to {how that it is not as its name imports, a mufcle having a membranous appearance, it has on the contrary a very thick fleftiy belly. The Semi-tendinosus (177-) is next to it, and the reafon of its being named Semi-tendi- nofus is feen in the length of its tendon (y). The Semi-membranofus and the Semi- tendinofus form together the inner ham-ftring. The outer ham-ftring is formed by the Tendon of the Biceps Cruris Mufcle; and the belly of the Biceps (180.) is feen held out by three flicks, fo as to fhow the deep hollow betwixt the ham-ftring3, in which is feen hanging the great Sacro-Sciatic Nerve (r); where it is going down the back of the thigh, to pafs down under the heads of the Gaftrocnemii Mufcles. The Great Gluteus Muscle (163.) is feen upon the hip diffedled, fo as to fhow the order of its fibres, and hanging like the reft of the leg all loofe and flaccid. The Vastus Internus (174.) is alfo feen making a fleftiy belly juft over the knee-joint. The two bellies of the Gastrocnemius Muscle (181.) are feea rifing each from its own Condyle of the thigh bone at (n), and meeting together to be joined into the great Achillis tendon (t) ; which grows gradually fmaller as it goes downwards to be im- planted into the heel at (V), where ftill it is very thick and ftrong. The great belly and tendon of the Flexor Pollicis (188.) is alfo feen palling behind the inner ancle. A part of the belly of the SoLiEUS (182.) is feen lying under the belly of the Gaftro- cnemius.

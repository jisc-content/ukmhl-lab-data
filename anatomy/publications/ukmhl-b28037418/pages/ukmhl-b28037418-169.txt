BOOK SECOND, PLATE SECOND. 95 ’which form the Rima Glottidis or opening of the windpipe) ; and bj this deepnefs at its back part, the Cricoid Cartilage raifes the opening of the Glottis fo high, (as is feen figures vii. and viii.) that it is behind the very center of the Thyroid Car- tilage where it is well defended and fafe. The Articulating Surfaces upon which $he Arytenoid Cartilages fit down, are marked (f). (4.) The Arytenoid Cartilages, are the fmall and moveable ones, which are of a Triangular form; they are fet down upon the upper border of the Cricoid Cartilage, by their bafe (g) with a very moveable articulation ; and (§•) points to the focket furface of the Arytenoid Cartilage by which the articulation is formed. For here the two uppermoft drawings of the Cartilage are fet oppofite to each other, almoll in their natural pofitions, and refting upon their bafis, while the loweft drawing of the three, is turned up fo as to Ihow its joint. The two fharp points of the Ary- tenoid Cartilages Hand perpendicularly upwards, and give the fliape and opening of the Glottis. The tips of the two Arytenoid Cartilages are feen over the Thyroid Cartilage in figure vii . and the Cartilages are feen full in figure viii, fettled in their place, and forming the Rima Glottidis or chink of the windpipe, which is narrower or wider as they are moved by their mufcles. (5.) Shows the Epiglottis, which may be compared to an Artichoke leaf. It flaps down like a fmall tongue or valve, and, by clapping neatly down upon the Rima Glottidis, makes the food and drink glide clear over the Glottis, and into the Gullet or Pharynx. The Epiglottis is reprefented in this drawing, fo as to ex- plain its connexion with the Os Hyoides, and of Courfe with the root of the tongue. SECOND ROW. The connexions are explained in the figures of the fecond row ; each part preferves its peculiar marks (1.2.3.) and it is feen in figure vi. in what fuccefiion thefb parts Hand. * (i.) The

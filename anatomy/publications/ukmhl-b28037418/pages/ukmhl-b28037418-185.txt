I OCj % BOOK SECOND, PLATE THIRD. been named Mufculus Linguae Pollychrellus. And (r) is the tongue itfelf, com- pofed chiefly of thefe mufcles, and covered with its membrane. The Genio-hyoideus (38.) is a mufcle riling from the fame point (0), of the chin ; Is implanted into the Os Ilyoideus. This mufcle which rifes from the point of the chin only, lies under the Mylo-hyoideus (37.) {vide Figure i.) which rifes from the whole length of the jaw ; and thefe together pull the Os Hyoides, and of confequence the throat upwards. So that there is feen by thefe two drawings, firft, how the Mylo-hyoideus,(37.) figure i. and the Genio-hyoideus, (38.) figure ii.pull the throat upwards. Secondly, how the Digaf- tric Mufcle (40.) and the three Styloid Mufcles, figure iiÂ» pull the throat upwards and backwards. Thirdly, how the Sterno-thyroidei, Sterno-hyoidei, and Omo- hyoidei pull the throat downwards. And it is laltly very plain, that thefe at the fame time that they are properly mufcles of the throat, are occafionally mufcles of the lower jaw, the only ones indeed which pull it down ; little force is needed for this, the jaw dropping almolt by its own weight; but, as the motion mull be quick and voluntary, it mull be done by mufcles; and when the mufcles from the Sternum fix the throat or pull it down, the Genio-hyoidei, Mylo-hyoidei and Bi- venter deprefs the jaw ; f@ that the motions of the jaw and throat, or in other words, the adlion of chewing and fwallowing have tins confent, that they are partly per- formed by the fame common mufcles, fo that we cannot chew and fwallow at once; the jaw which moves in chewing the morfel, mull be fixed when it is to be fwal- lowed; and fo the motions for chewing and Iwallowing alternatively fucceed each other.

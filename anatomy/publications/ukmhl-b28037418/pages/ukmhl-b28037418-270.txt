16& or THE JOINTS. form 3 fo that there are the following parts attached to the Coracoid Procefs (?), viz. the Coraco-brachialis (72.), and the lhort head of the biceps (&), going down from it, the Ligamentum Triangulare Proprium (*w) going to the Acromion, and the Ligamentum Commune (n) going to the Clavicle. The Capfule or bag of the joint which is exceedingly thin, and lax, is marked (0 0) ; and it is cut open to Ihow the head of the bone, as it lies in its focket. This Ihows alfo the long tendon (i), of the Coraeo-brochiffe as . it comes through the focket, lying upon the round head of the ihoulder bone. And laftly, the flat tendon of the Subfcapularis is feen fpreading over the Capfular Ligament at (/>), by which it will be eafily conceived, how the other mufcles fpread over the Capfule to {Length- en it; for here it is feen, that the cut edge of the Capfule, and the cut edge of the tendon of the Subfcapularis is one and the fame part; that is, the flat tendon and the Capfule are fo incorporated, that the one cannot be cut nor torn without the other. And thus it may be underftood, how the chief fecurity and ftrength of the Ihoulder joint is from the mufcles furrounding its Capfule fo clofely, and feeing implanted direftly into the head of the bone. FIGURE II. Is intended chiefly for lhowing the fhallownefs of the Glenoid Cavity, when com- pared with the head of the bone, and it alfo explains very wrell the way in which the long tendon of the biceps rifes from the margin of the Glenoid Cavity. The Scapula (A) is naked, but w'ith the remains of ragged flefh hanging about it; where (?) marks the Spine of the Scapula riling towards (tf), which is the point of the Acromion Procefs; (?) marks the apex of the Coracoid Procefs fcarcely feen; (m) is the Ligamentum Proprium Triangulare lying rather in lhadow; the Capfule is here alfo marked (0 0) ; it is cut up and thrown quite back in a fquare

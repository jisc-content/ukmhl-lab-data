-OF THE MUSCLES. 104 membranous, where it lies upon the fore-part of the Trachea. We find the Gland fmaller in men, larger in women ; of great variety in refpeÂ£l of fize ; very general- ly fo large, as to be diftinguiihed by the fingers on the outfide of the throat; very often enlarged, and often defcending deep behind the Trachea, fo that the two op- pofite lobes almoft meeting behind, furround that Tube, and explain to us how ter- rible and how incurable (by any operation at leaf!), thaf fuffocation mull be, which proceeds from a fwelling of this Gland. This form of the Gland almoft furround- ing the Trachea, the two oppofite lobes nearly meeting behind, is better explained in the Trachea, drawn at Figure vi. Plate ii. The parts of the Trachea, with which the mufcles are more immediately conne&ed; are, (h.) The Os Hyoides, which lies in the root of the tongue. (2.) The Thyroid Cartilage, where it proje&s to form the Pomum Adami. (3.) The Cricoid Cartilage, which is above the Thyroid Gland. Therefore the Thyroid Gland is hardly entitled to the name of Thyroid, fince, in place of refting upon the Thyroid Cartilage, it lies quite below both the Thyroid and Cricoid Cartilages, upon the firft, or rather upon the fecond ring of the Trachea. The Muscles are these, (437.) is the Sterno Mastoideus, the great mufcle of the neck; thrown back to expofe thofe fmaller mufcles which belong properly to the throat; and there is feen, (34.) The Sterno-Hyoideus, coming up from the Sternum, going upwards to the Os Hyoides, long, flat, ribband-like, and bending where it paffes over the Thyroid Gland. (35.) The Sterno-Thyroideus, coming alfo upwards from the Sternum ; ftretching to- wards the Thyroid Cartilage; lying under the laft named mufcle; like it flat and ribband-like; covering alfo the Thyroid Gland, and bulging a little where it paffes over the chief bulk of the Gland. (S^O The Omo-Hyoideus, coming upwards from the ihoulder. It is a digaftric or two-bellied

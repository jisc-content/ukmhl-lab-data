OF THE MUSCLES. H4 (78.) The Biceps, the Thick Mufcle of the fore part of the Arm, is feen in the upper figure. But the middle of its belly only is feen ; its heads lying under the Deltoid Mufcle. The Brachialis Internus, (79.^ which lies under the Biceps, is feen in the uper drawing, but it is better feen in the lower drawing; and the manner of its riling from the fore part of the Ihoulder-bone is tolerably well exprelfed. Neither of the heads of the Biceps can be feen in the upper drawing, becaufe of the Deltoid Mufcle; but in the lower drawing, where the Deltoid is cut up from the Scapula, and reclined backwards, the longer head of the Biceps is feen raifed upon the blow-pipe, (Â£) which is palled under it juft where the tendon is coming out from the Capfule of the Ihoulder joint; for this head of the Biceps is a long and {lender tendon, which comes from within the cavity of the Ihoulder joint, and goes down under the belly of the Deltoid Mufcle, being tendinous quite to the middle of the arm. The mufcles of the Fore Arm are arranged in my defcription of the Mufcles under two clafles. I. The Extenfors of the wrift, fingers, and thumb, which all keep the outer round fide of the fore-arm, arifing chiefly from the outer Condyle. IT. The Flexors, or Benders of the wrift, fingers, and thumb, which lie all upon the inner flat fide of the fore-arm, riling in their turn, chiefly from the inner Condyle. In thefe drawings the extenfors only can be feen ; in the drawings of the next plate all the flexors are feen. To begin then with the Mufcles lying upon the upper or radial edge of the fore arm, there is, (92.) The Supinator Longus Radii, which turns the palm of the hand up ; for it rifes from the fnoulder bone, above the elbow joint, and gees down the fore-arm with a long fiat tendon, which is marked (1) to be planted into the Radius at its fore-part. (102.) The Supinator Radii Brevis, is a deeper Mufcle, and therefore it is feen only

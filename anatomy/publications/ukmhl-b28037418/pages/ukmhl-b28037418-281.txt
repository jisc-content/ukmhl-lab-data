Book third, plate second. 177 / The great Lateral Ligament on the outer fide of the knee-joint is marked (y). It is here feen, that the External Lateral Ligament is not fo flat as the Internal one, that it does not lie fo fairly as the Internal one upon the fide of the joint, but that it inclines a little towards the back part; and it is feen in the drawing as I have explained it in the book, that the proper External Ligament, the Ligamentum Laterale Externum Longum (<7), is a large and ftrong ligament, proceeding from the outer Condyle of the thigh bone, and fixed into the head of the Fibula; but that the Ligamentum Externum Laterale Brevius vel Minus (r), has not the true form of a Lateral Ligament coming down from the Condyle, but is a mere {Lengthening or outward band of the Capfule, rifing upwards from the knob of the Fibula. So that in thefe two drawings, iii. and iv. are feen, all the chief parts on the outfide of the knee-joint. z. The bones as, (a) the thigh bone; (&) the Tibia; (c) the Rotula or Patella; (an) the Fibula ; and (f) the ftrong Ligament of the Patella, a part which is pro- perly arranged with the bones. 2. There is the Capfule and parts conne&ed with it, as (a) the thin membrane of the Capfule itfelf^ (d) the Fafcia or expanding tendon of the Vaftus Internus fpreading over it, to ftrengthen it. 3. The Lateral and Pofterior Ligaments, as (Â£) the Internal Lateral Ligament, flat, ftrong, and almoft triangular; with a fmall ligament (pi) to ftrengthen it; (y) the great External Lateral Ligament rounder and more oblique ; which (in its turn alfo) is {Lengthened by a fmaller ligament (r). And Laftly, the {Lengthen- ings on the back part of the joint, which are irregular at (0), and which form fometimes a more regular Ligament at (/>), ^ Ligamentum Posticum Wins- LOW II. This Anatomy of the knee-joint is continued in the two firft figures of next plate.' Z PLATE

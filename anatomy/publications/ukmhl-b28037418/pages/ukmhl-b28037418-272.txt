The two heads of the biceps are not joined to each other till they pafs the middle of the arm, i. e. below the point where (78.J the number of the biceps is placed. Lafllr, The chief point in this drawing is the Burfa Mucofa marked (ni) ; which lies on the outfide of the Capfular Ligament of the joint; it is very large, and is furround- ed by many fmaller ones. This is fufficient to explain the appearance of a Burfa Mucofa; the ufe of this great one, lying betwixt the Capfule of the joint and the Acromion Procefs is eafdy conceived, and the nature of the fmaller ones lying, under the point of the Coracoid Procefs, and under each of the tendons, as of the Teres Major, Latiffimus Dorfi, &c. need hardly be explained *, FIGURE IV. Explains the Elbow7-joint; and rifo ftiows the Wrift, but imperfectly. The three bones which form the Elbow-joint are, the Humerus («) ? the Radius (£) -r and the Ulna (c). They tyre all connected with each other by the general Capfule or bag of the joint (d), which is derived from the Periofteum, coming off from the Ihoulder bone above thofe hollows which receive the Olecranon and Co- ronoid Proceffes ; which is in itfelf thin, and delicate,, but is crofled by lateral and Tranfverfe Ligaments, fo that it does not appear like a diftinCt bag ; and therefore the chief demonftration is of the bands, wdiich go acrofs the Capfular Ligament to {Lengthen it in various directions. O x. The Coronary Ligament of the Radius is not, as might be fuppofed, any diftiaft ligament, but merely a particular form of that part of the General Capfule. The * This is the Burfa which I had feen diftended with a prodigious quantity of glairy fluid, and producing a tumor upon the Ihoulder. Fid. Book upon the Joints, page 431.

73 BOOK FIRST, PLATE TWELFTH. i. i. 3- 6. '7* (a. n.) Repeated on the three fides of the Radius, explain the general triangular form of the bone, marking particularly its three edges. (3) Marks the upper head of the Radius, flat, round and button-like, with the fide rol- ling upon the Lefler Sygmoid Hollow of the Ulna. (c) The neck of the Radius or ftraiter part, which immediately fupports the head. (d) The Bump or Tubercle of the Radius, into which the tendon of the Biceps Mufcle is implanted. (y) The Lower Head of the Radius; the Bone is thus gradually enlarging towards its lower end. (f) The Scaphoid, or boat-like Cavity on the lower end of the Radius for receiving the two largefl: bones of the Carpus forming the wrifl joint. (jf) The Styloid Procefs of the Radius, which bounds the wrifl; joint towards the fide of the thumb : and here it is feen how the little head of the Ulna (7) is received into the hollow focket on the fide of the Radius. The two iharp edges of the Ra- dius and Ulna are oppofed to each other, Ihowing how the Inter-ofleous Membrane ftretches from the one bone to the other, filling up all the fpace marked (h.) And it is here feen that the Radius is fomewhat arched towards the Ulna, fo as to roll round it without touching it, or hurting or difordering the numerous mufcles, &c. which lie upon the Inter-ofleous Membrane. FIGURE IV. ^Explains the Bones of the Carpus or Wrist, as they are feen from the outfide, or back of the hand. The Bones of the Carpus are 8 in number, they are divided pretty regularly into two rows ;â€”and we rather choofe to count and demonftrate them according to their rank, than as individual and feparate bones : for as feparate bones there is nothing very particular in any one ; but by their combination and form, and as they relate to the 1 K wrifl

The ligaments which tie together the Tarfus and Metatarfus are ffifo feen here, at the roots of the rnetatarfal bones. There arerlateral ligaments which tie each rnetatarfal bone to the one next it. But the ligaments which appear chiefly upon this upper furface, are a continuation of the irregular web of ligament belonging to the Tarfal bones; and as this web takes particular lhapes in paffing along to the feveral heads of the Metatarfal bones, thefe are bed named, in general terms, Ligamenta Dorsa- lia, the Dorfal Ligaments of the Metatarfal bones; and they are marked (sss).

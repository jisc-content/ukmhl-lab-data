PREFACE. XX defign of thefe plates, it is very natural for me to fay alfo a few words concerning the mechanical labour. I have drawn my plates with my own hand. I have engraved fome of thefe plates, and etched almolt the whole of them: Which I mention only to (how, that they have their chance of being corredt in the anatomy, and that whatever, by my interference, they may have loft in elegance, they have gained, I hope, in truth and accuracy.—And while 1 mention this, I mult not be ungrateful to Mr Beugo, whofe (kill will, I hope, be Ihown on fome higher occalion, and whofe character mult not be hurt by any thing that may be feen here ; for wherever in thefe plates all is fair and clean, it is owing to his care ; .and thofe blots of execution which are not fairly co- vered, have not come through his correcting hand.—Whatever he has done alone has been hurried, allowing no time for artful or laborious engraving, though fill all that is here, I hope, is correct and true. I ted was to receive, in patting through a greater mind, a grander form.—The expedient was tried again, and the fecond anatomift refolving to outdo at one ftroke all his rivals, and knowing of no furer way than this, had an engraving made of a mod gigantic fize ! An Alkapart J A figure of full fix feet in height; which (bating the clumfinefs of conception) has turned out to be a drawing of fuch Angular beauty, that it will not be rivalled; and as there can be no reprefentation of the human body of more than 6 feet high, it pofitively cannot be excelled.—All thofe who underftand the intention and effeA of engraving, or who have any idea of the bold and free manner which clafs drawings require, mud wonder even at the report of fuch a thing; but not as our poet Young wonders, “ for wonder is involuntary praife ;” if the emotion be involuntary, it will mod: likely be of another kind.

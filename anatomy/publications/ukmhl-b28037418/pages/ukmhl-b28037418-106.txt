OF THE SOME3. 46 FIGURE four Articulating Procefles, (the two upper, as well as the two lower,) are mark- ed 2, 2. (3.) The Spinous Procefs, is fhort, flat, very broad, and Hands horizontally and direftly out, fo as not to embarrafs the motions of the loins. (4.) The Tranfverfe Procefs is ihort, direft, and very Hrong ; and the Articulating Procefles ("2, 2) go off from the root of it. In each Vertebra, there is formed by the roots of the Tranfverfe and Oblique Procefles, where they arife from the body, a ring or circle of Bone, which is in each drawing marked (*)', it is for containing the Spinal Marrow. FIGURE IE Xs a Vertebra of the Back ; where, (T.) The body is fliorter, and is a large fegment (viz. nearly two thirds) of a fmall circle. (2.) The Articulating Process is fmall and flat, and a little inclined, but not very oblique. (3.) The Spinous Procefs is long, aquiline, deprefied to fuch an angle that the two Spi- nous Procefles almoil touch each other, (as is feen in Fig. IV.) (3. 3.) and allow of but a very limited motion. (4.) The Tranfverfe Procefs is long, Hands direftly outwards, or is inclined a little up- wards, and upon every dorfal vertebra there are two marks for the articulation of the ribs ; one (U) on the fide of the vertebra itfelf, or rather betwixt the bodies of two vertebrae, for the proper head of the rib, (Tig. X. and XI.) ( 1.); and again there is another articulating furface (c) upon the face or fore part of the Tranfverfe Procefs, which is for the articulation of the little knob (Fig. X. and XI.) (3.) upon the back part of each rib.

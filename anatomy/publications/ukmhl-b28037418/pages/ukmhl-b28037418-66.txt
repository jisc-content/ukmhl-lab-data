22 CF THE BONES. (J) Is the Foramen Ovale, (larger than the Foramen Rotund mm) which tranfrnits the third branch of the fifth pair, going to the lower jaw. 5. (<•) The- Spinous Hole, the Foramen Spinale, which is a fmall hole in the very point or tip of the Spinous Procefs. It is not for the transmiflion of a.nerve; but for the entrance of that fmall artery which belongs to the Dura Mater, and which goes along the inner furface of the Parietal Bone, marking it with its furrow. A bridle is palled through this hole in one fide, to fliow the courfe of the artery. 6. The fixth Hole. The Pteregoidean, or Vidian Hole, is not to be feen in this view ; but is to be feen in the next Plate, IV. where it is marked with its proper number, 6. (/) Reprefents the rough furface where the cuneiform or wedge-like part of this Sphos- noid Bone has been broken off from the wedge-like procefs of the Occipital Bone. (y) Marks the Cells of the Sphoenoid Bone, which are occafionally very large, as in this Bone ; and which make all the bone hollow under the Celia. Turcica. (£) Shows where the Palate Bone had adhered to the Sphoenoid ;—and the Palate Bone, being torn away, has broken, and left fome of its fmall cells flicking here to the Sphoenoid Bone. N. B. The Cells of the Palate Bone are explained in the next plate. This Bone is connected;- at (2) Figure VI. with the (Ethmoid Bone before ;— at (/) Figure V. with the Os Occipitis behind ;—at (1.) with the Temporal Bones in the Temples. The Spinous Procefs (3.) is locked in betwixt the Temporal and Occipital

53 OF THE BONES. FIGURE The Points of Description are, (1.) Tiie Body : ——.very thick, flrong, of a cylindrical form, bending outwards with a gentle curve. (2.) The Head, which is very fmooth, and very fairly circular. It is a large fegmeut of a fmall circle, and is let pretty deep down into its focket. There is a dimple at (a which marks the place wrhere the central ligament once was. (3.) The Neck of the Bone, long, and almoft horizontal, to fet the ftiaft of the bone the wider off from the Haunch Bone, that it may move freely. (4.) The great Trochanter, a large bump or procefs for the infertion of the Glutaei Mufcles. (5.) The lefler Trochanter, a fmaller procefs, for the infertion of many mufcles which move the Thigh Bone inwards. (6.) The Linea Afpera, or rough line, from which much of the Mufcular flefli that covers the thigh arifes. And this Linea Afpera, or rough line begins at (b) in a forking form from the roots of each Trochanter :—-the two lines meet, and the Linea Afpera becomes fingle in the middle of the thigh, (r)—Towards its lower end (d) it forks again to go off towards each Condyle. (7.) The two Condyles, which form the great articulating furfaces of the Thigh Bone, where it lies in the knee-joint.—In Fig. II. we fee that the inner Condyle (e) is the larger one ; being larger to compenfate for the oblique direction of the thigh bone. At (f) Fig. II. we fee, covered with cartilage, the flat polilhed furface upon which the Rotula or knee-pan rolls.—And in Fig. I. at (g) we fee the very deep notch betwixt the two Condyles, in which the crucial ligaments of the knee-joint lie.

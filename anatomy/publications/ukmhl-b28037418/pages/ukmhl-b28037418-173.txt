BOOK SEtOND, PLATE SECOND. 99 transfixed with the Trocar, which neither excites contractions, nor gives pain : Be- fides the obltruftion which requires Bronchotomy, is feldom in the tongue or mouth ; more commonly in the Larynx ; not unfrequently in the Thyroid Gland. So that almoft all the occafions that can be fuppofed, are fuch as keep us down to the very lowed point of the Trachea, viz. That neared the ched. THIRD ROW. This row is for demondrating the chief mufcles of the Larynx, and Pharynx ; and of courfe, the motions of thefe feveral parts upon each other. And it explains, fird, the mufcles which lie immediately upon the Cartilages of the Larynx, and which move the parts of the throat upon each other ; and thefe lead to a know- ledge of thofe longer mufcles, which come from the jaws, or chin, or dernum, or flioulder ; and by which the whole throat is moved. Thefe are represented care- fully in the middle figure of this third row, and alfo in the next plate. . Figure IX. Explains chiefly the Hyo-ihyroidaei, and Crico-thyroidsei Mufcles ; for fird. The Crico-thyroidjei (42), arife by a fmall pointed origin, (/) from the fore part of the Cricoid Cartilage ; go upwards and obliquely outwards about an inch in length ; are implanted by a broad infertion (ot), into the lower border of the Thyroid Cartilage, and where they end, the next mufcle begins. For the Eyo-tkyroibieus (41), is a long, flat, and fielhy mufcle, about an inch and a half, or two inches in length ; lying fiat upon the fmooth face of the Thyroid Cartilage ; riling from the lower border of the Thyroid Cartilage below, and implanted broad and flefhy above, into the bads of the Os Hyoides a little to one fide, and to a part of the.horn. Sometimes this mufcle is divided into two flips, as it is drawn by Cowper, but more commonly it is fingle, as reprefented here, and the upper end of the Sterno-hyoideus (34), is feen here marked with its proper number.

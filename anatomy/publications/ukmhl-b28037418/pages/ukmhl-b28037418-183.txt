BOOK SECOND, PLATE THIRD. I07 is turgid with blood, and bulging out in the form of a dilated inteftine : the eighth pair of nerves goes down along with the Carotid Artery and Jugular vein, they being all inclofed in one common Iheath of Cellular Subftance, which is here dif- fered away, to fhow thefe parts clean. The Os Hyoides is marked (1.) ; the Thyroid Cartilage is marked (2.) ; the Cricoid Cartilage is hidden by the mufcles. In this drawing, the Sterno-maftoideus (137.) is very fully difiedted, is made flaccid, and is laid to one fide, fo as to Ihow the mufcles of the throat freely ; which for the fake of a clear demonftration, I fhall divide into three fets. 1. The mufcles from the Sternum, which pull the throat downwards. 2. The Digaftric and the Styloid Mufcles, which pull the throat upwards. 3. The mufcles which make the flelh of the tongue, the chief part of its bulk. I. The mufcles coming upwards from the Sternum and fhoulder are, (34.) The Sterno-hyoideus, which is feen in all its length, ftretching from the Sternum to the Os Hyoides, and bending over the Thyroid Gland. (35.) The Sterno-thyroideus ; exactly like this, lying behind and under it, proceeding from the Sternum to end in the Thyroid Cartilage, and alfo bending over the Thyroid Gland. (41.) Is the place where the Sterno-thyroideus ends ; and the Thyro-hyoideus begins ; this (41.) then, is like a continuation of the fame mufcle, while it is really a diftinÂ£t one, named Thyro-iiyoideus (41.) becaufe it goes from the Thyroid Cartilage, to the Os Hyoides. (36.) Is the Omo-hyoideus, of which the flefliy belly is marked, as in the other draw- ing (36.) while its middle tendon is marked (&). 2. The

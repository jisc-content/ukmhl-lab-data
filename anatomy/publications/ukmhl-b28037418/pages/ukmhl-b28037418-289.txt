The Moveable Cartilages. The two Moveable Cartilages are not feen in Fig. 1. becaufe the mucous ligament which covers them is entire. In Fig. ii. they are marked (mm). The letters (m m) touch the outer edges of the cartilages, where their outer margins adhere to the inner furface of the capfule. The parts and connexions ofthefe cartilages are better explained in Fig. iii. where (m m) Hill mark the outer circles which adhere to the inner furface of the capfule. The letters (« n) mark the thinner edges, and {how the fpace in the center of each cartilage which holds the condyle of the thigh-bone, (pp) Mark the two pollerior horns and the little tags of ligament by which they are tied to the crucial ligaments behind. And (jq q) mark the two anterior horns, and the little tags of ligament by which they are tied to the root of the mucous ligament before. And (r) marks a little crofs liga- ment by which the two anterior horns are conne&ed with each other, and which is named Ligamentum Transversale Commune, 4. The Crucial Ligaments Are well feen in Fig. ii. where (c) marks the part from which the pointed origin of the mucous ligament was cut away. And by cutting away that ligament, the Crucial Li., gaments which, in Fig. i. are covered by the mucous- or central ligaments, are in this drawing brought into view The Crucial Ligaments lie both in the back part of the joint, and touch that part of the Capfule, which lies in the Ham; but one of them (s) lies behind, whence it is. called the Pollerior Ligament, and the_ other (?) though it lies flat upon the Pollerior

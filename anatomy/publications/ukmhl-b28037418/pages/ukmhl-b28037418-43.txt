BOOK FIRST, PLATE FIRST. 5 FIGURE II, 2. The Lambdoidal Suture, joining the occipital to the parietal bones ; finding over the occiput, refembling the Greek letter A. â€” But the refemblance is a little hurt by the accident of an Os Wormianutn, or irregular bone, fuch as is found more frequently in this future than in any other; fometimes {ingle, as in the fcull from which this was drawn; but fometimes in great numbers, and not unfrequently of the fize of a crown piece ; thefe Ofifa Wormiana may difplace the Lambdoidal Suture fo, that being out of the ufual direction, it may be miftaken for a fra&ure. 3. The Sagittal Suture, joining the parietal bones to each other; extending from the Lambdoidal to the Coronal Suture, as an arrow lies betwixt the firing and the bow. 4. The Temporal or Squamous Suture, belonging chiefly to the temporal bone; and called fquamous or fcaled, becaufe the edges of the temporal and parietal bones are there extremely thin, and are laid over each other like the fcales of armour. One part marked (in) lying betwixt the occipital and parietal bones, is named the Additamentum Suturse Squamofte, or fupplement of the Squamous Suture. v 5. Marks a part of the Spiiaenoidal Suture, joining the wing of the Sphenoid Bone, to the temporal, frontal, and parietal bones, for, in this hollow under the zygoma, all thefe bones meet by thin fcaled edges, and lap over each other; fo that all the futures in the Temple are fquamous. 6. The Transverse Suture, is one which runs acrofs the face, through the middle of the orbits, and over the root of the nofe, and the end of it appears here, joining the angular procefes of the frontal bone, and of the cheek bone. 7. The Zygomatic Suture.

#v THE MUSCLES. In Figure XII. thefe points are feen ; (a) the ring which the Dura Mater forms, where it comes from the brain into the Orbit, accompanying the Optic Nerve; (b) the ori- gin of the Obliquus Superior and Levator, from this part of the Dura Mater fur- rounding the Optic Hole, (c) The origins of the Abdu£lor and Deprimens, but the letter (V) points more particularly to the origin of the Abdu&or, which is here feen to be a Biceps, or two headed mufcle, having two Tendons, and the fmaller nerves which belong to the mufcles of the eye are feen at (d), palling betwixt thefe two ten- dinous origins of the Abdu&or. For it is to be remembered, that this Abdu&or along with two of the Recli, rifes from that part of the Dura Mater, which covers the Foramen Lacerum; and that the fmall nerves enter the focket by the Fora- men Lacerum. From this root round the Optic Nerve, the mufcles are feen going forwards. 1. The Obliquus Superior or Trochlearis (29) uppermolt, the longeft mufcle of the eye with its llender Tendon palling through the Cartilaginous Pulley (<r), which is left Hill in its place attached to the Superciliary Ridge of the Frontal Bone (/)• 2. The Obliqtjus Inferior, (30) is feen, the Ihortell mufcle ©f the eye, ariling from the lower part of the Orbit, and going backwards to antagonize the lalt. 3. The Rectus Superior (25) next to the Re&us Internus which it hides, is the Ihortell mufcle. 4. The Rectus Externus (28) or Abducens Oculi, is the longell of all the llraight mufcles of the eye. 5. The Rectus Inferior or Deprimens Oculi (26) islhorter than the Abducens, (28) but longer than the Reft us Superior (25), becaufe the Optic Nerve enters a little above the center of the Orbit. The Tendons of thefe Recli Mufcles are feen expand- ing flat and broad upon the forepart of the eye ; where by Ihining through that thin and Tranfparent Ikin, which covers the forepart of the eye, they form what is called the Albuginia, or "White <?oat of the eye.

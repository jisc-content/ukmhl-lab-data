4l BOOK FIRST, PLATE SIXTH. Holes, one is named the Anterior, the other is named the Posterior, Orbitary Hole. So that in this drawing, there are feen all the holes around the Orbit, vix. (r) The Supra Orbitary Hole, or Superciliary Hole; (^) the Infra Orbitary Hole; and (l) the internal Orbitary PIole. In the orbit is feen (;/) the Tranfverfe Suture on the right lide pure ; on the left fide alfo it is feen, but appears very ir- regular as it really is, for it joins together a great many irregular bones. Within the orbit fome other parts are alfo feen here, which are not fo well explained in any other plate.—The whole conftitution of the orbit is feen ; — (i.) Marks the Os Unguis in its plain part, where the eye rolls upon it. (2.) Marks the Groove of Os Unguis, where the nafal du£l lies ; (3.) the Os Planum, which is in fa£l the plain fide of the (Ethmoid bone as feen Plate III. Fig. III. at (e.) (4.) Is the Orbitary Procefs of the Upper Jaw Bone. (5.) Is the Orbitary Procefs of the Sphoenoid Bone, which is exadtly oppofite to its Temporal Ala or wing (E.) (6.) Is the Orbitary Plate of the Frontal Bone, which forms far the greater part of the Orbit; and (7.) at the bottom of the Orbit is the Optic hole. In the Nofe, the letter (w) denotes the Vomer, the bone which forms the partition of the Nofe. FIGURE II. THE VERTICAL SECTION OF THE SCULL. A Is the Frontal Bone ; where (a) marks the Coronal Suture feen from within like a mere crack, and not ferrated or "zig-zag, as on the outer furface of the fcull; (3) marks the fmall proje&ing Spine, to which the falx is attached, and which projects fometimes half an inch, making it impoflible to trepan fafely at this point; (c) the Orbitary Procefs, or plate, which lies over the eye; (d) the Bump mark- F ing

OF THE BONES.. € FIGURE II. THE F (E T A L SCULL, * Explains the Foetal Scull;- where we find the holes, procefles, and othe? marks, very imperfect: Of courfe a Ihorter and more Ample explanation will ferve.

B The Parietal Bone ; where alfo the letter marks the center of ofiification; the- radii are very plain; and the edges are feen imperfe£t and membraneous, leaving all the futures imperfeft. The ridge, which divides the bone, is not yet formed; for the Temporal Mufcle has not yet begun to mark the bone, C The Occipital Bone; where the letter again in this bone, points to an ofiifying central point. D The Temporal Bone ; where many parts, marked in the Adult Scull, as the Styloid and Maftoid procefles, —the fmall hole,—and the marks of the Temporal Mufcle, are all wanting. And the ring (o) of the Meatus Auditorius Externus, is

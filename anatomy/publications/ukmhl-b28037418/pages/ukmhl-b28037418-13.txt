Perhaps there can be no higher compliment betwixt medical men, than this confidence in time of ficknefs; and furely, if I may judge from my own feelings, nothing can be more grateful than the remembrance of kindneffes be- llowed at fuch a time.- May your fkill be long ufeful to your fellow- citizens 5 and may it be always valued as I value it.

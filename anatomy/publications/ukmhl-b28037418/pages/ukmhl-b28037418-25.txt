PREFACE. XI Now wefhould always remember that anatomy is to be learnt only by difledlion*; difledtion is the firft and laft bufinefs of the {In- dent; and when drawings are made for his ufe, the body fliould be laid out, as he is to order it in diftebtion; the belly fhould be difolayed, as he can difplay it in his fubjedt; an arm fliould be fo drawn, that, when he diflebls the arm of the fubjebt, it may fall na- turally upon the table, exabtly as he finds it in his book; and ftill the pofture of arms, and legs, and heads, fliould be preferved di- ftinbt and clear: enough of the general figure fliould be kept to explain the pofture of parts; there fliould be kept up a natural correfpondence among the feveral drawings; and while the true anatomical drawing is delivered upon one plate, a plan, if it be required, fliould be added upon the next. b 2 I * If anatomy is to be acquired in this way only, then mud we underftand by a fchool of anatomy a fchool of diffedion : Yet thofe who have had the happinefs of profecuting their ftudies in foreign univerfities, or in the London fchools, will hardly believe it, that there is at lead one place of education much celebrated, and woithy to be fo, where the dudy of anatomy is denied or profcribed.—Where not only it is not praifeworthy, but even dangerous to propofe diffedions; where the man who may be fo bold as to do his duty in that mod import- tant dudy, Ihallbe traduced in filthy pamphlets, thrud officioudy, and with intentions not of the- pured kind, into the hands of every young man who comes to fchool. If I have felt this, it has been dill in filence; till I now fpeak of it, not formally, but by chance ; not with the mean thought of prefenting myfelf as a perfecuted man, nor of indulging a refentment which were loft upon fuch people, or upon fuch an occafion; but to make my acknowlegements to one, whofe ge- nerous condud is not unknown; who is truly interefted in the honour and reputation of that uni- verfity to which he belongs; who is at once an honour and defence to it; and whofe fingle praife, (may I be allowed to fay what touches myfelf fo nearly,) “ fhall outweigh a whole theatre of “ others.”

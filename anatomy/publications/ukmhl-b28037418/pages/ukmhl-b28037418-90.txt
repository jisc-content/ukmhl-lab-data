The eighth pair of nerves paffes in the fmaller opening bepore the point, the Jugular Vein paffes in the greater opening behind it; a fmall bridle of the Dura Mater goes acrofs from this point, and makes the two holes diftind in the frelh fcull, and defends the eighth pair of nerves from the preffure of the Jugular Vein, when (as often happens) it is turgid with blood. to. The number (10.) marks the hole under the Condyle by which the ninth pair of nerves, the Lingual Nerve goes out. In Figure II. the chief points are thefe, (f) Marks the Anterior Palatine Hole. (g) Marks the Pofterior Palatine Hole. (h) The Vomer, or bone forming the partition of the nofe. (i) The outer Pteregoid Procefs. (£) The Inner Pteregoid Procefs. (/) The Cuneiform Procefs of the Occipital Bone. (x.) Marks the Foramen Lacerum, not that which is marked (») in figure i. but another Foramen Lacerum belonging alfo to the orbit, not for the tranfmiffion of nerves, but for the lodging of fat. ('q) Marks the Foramen Ovale. (r) The Spinous Hole. (2.) Is that great breach which is left by the fading of the Cartilaginous end of the Euf- tachian Tube. (r) Is the hole for the paffage of the Carotid Artery, which as on the infide of the fcull opens immediately behind the breach. (3.) Marks the, great Thimble-like hole, by which the Lateral Sinus comes out from the Scull, to form the great Jugular Vein. (4.) Is a hole feated behind the Condyle, the hole marked (10.) in figure i. is before the Condyle, and gives paffage to the ninth or Lingual pair of nerves ; this fmaller hole is behind the Condyle, and gives paffage to a fmall vein of the neck.

X PREFACE. gures of Alb in us are more defireable than thefe. But, in either book, we regret either extreme ; in Albinus we think that we under- ftand every mufcle of the human body! but our knowledge hardly bears the teft of diffeclion; the drawings and the fubjedl never can be directly compared:—In Bidloo, we have the very fubject be- fore us! the tables, the knives, the apparatus, down even to the flies that haunt the places of diffe&ion, all are prefented with the main obje<5t of the plate; and thus we have perfect confidence in the drawing; in which alfo the parts are laid out in a bold and maf- terly ftile, fo that the dead fubjefl and the engraving can well bear to be compared.

OF 1 HE MUSCLES, icS II. The lxuicles which pull the throat upwards are, (40.) The Digaftricus, of which the rlrft belly (40.) is feen coming out from under the Thy- roid Gland, while the fore belly (») being cut away from the chin, hangs down. (39.) The Stylo-Hyoideus Mufcle, which is feen turning over the tendon of the Digaftricus, and tying it down in its place. (53.) The Stylo-pharyngeus, which lies very deep behind the other Styloid Mufcles, paffes down under the arm or branch of the Os Hyoides, and expands upon the Pharynx. AT. B. In this drawing, the Styloid Mufcles are diffie&ed upwards very nearly to that point (under the Parotid Gland,) where they rife fmall and delicate, from around the roots of the Styloid Procefs. III. The mufcles which compofe the chief bulk of the tongue, are thefe, (58.) The Stylo-gloffus, which comes fmall and delicate from the root of the Styloid Procefs; expands as it goes towards the tongue, and whofe office is to pull the ton sue down into the mouth. (59.) The PIyo-glqssus, which L have reprefented as one Tingle flat mufcle, riling from nearly the whole length of the Os Hyoides *. (60.) Is the Genio-glossus, fo named from its riling from that point of the lower jaw bone (0), w’hich is called the chin ; its fibres go into the tongue in a radiated form, in every direction, capable of performing all kinds of motions, of lolling the tongue out, and alfo of retracing it again) whence this mufcle has by way of pre-eminence been * From its arifing in three fafciculi or diftinft bundles, <vi%. one from the balls, one from the horn, and one from the Cartilage of the Os Hyoides, it has been called the Bafio-chondro-cerato-glofliis, or each fafciculus has occafionally been deferibed, as a diftinft mufcle.

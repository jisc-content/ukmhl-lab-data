OF THE MUSCLES. to the fide of the Os Hyoides, and fo binding down the middle tendon of the digaf- tric mufcle. In this drawing then, are feen the chief mufcles which affeft the general pofition of the throat, viz. 2. The Sterno-Hyoideus (34.), Sterno-Thyroideus (35*)Â» an<^ t^ie Omo-Hyoideus, (36.) pulling the throat downwards. 2. The Mylo-Hyoideus (37.), the Stylo-Hyoideus (39.), and the Digaftricus (40.), pulling the throat upwards. One fmall mufcle remains to be explained ; it is the Crico-thyroideus (42.), which a- rifes from (3.) the Cricoid Cartilage to be inferted into (2.) the Thyroid Cartilage. FIGURE II. Is the head of a woman, the neck long, the (lender mufcles of the throat much difle&ed and thrown out, very loofe and flaccid; and the Thyroid Gland was in this fubjedl particularly large, hung very low down, and made a confiderable bending in the two long mufcles which run over it. This drawing is a freer diffeclion of thefe mufcles, where all the Anatomy of the throat is feen ; for the Parotid Gland, the Carotid Artery, the Jugular vein, the eighth pair of nerves, and the chief mufcles both of the throat, and of the tongue, are here. The Jaw Bone is here, as in the former figure, marked (a) ; the Parotid Gland ([b) ; the Carotid Artery (d~) ; the Jugular vein (<?) ; and the Thyroid Gland, which appears only at two points, and almoft covered by the mufcles, is marked (g). But the mod important parts in the Anatomy of the neck, are the Carotid Artery (d) ; the Jugular vein (e) ; and the Par Vagum, or eighth pair of nerves (8 ) This eighth pair is a long nerve, which goes Prom the head down to the fcomach to end there. It is marked (8.) ; it is feen here, lying upon the great Jugular vein, which k

OF THE BONES. (h) Marks a lefsflr opening, which is formed by the meeting of the Lambdoidal and Sagittal Sutures ; but, as they do not crofs, there are here but 3 converg- ing lines ; three angles or points of bone ; no perceptible opening, but the bones rather lapping over each other. It is over this point that the hair turns in a fort of vortex, if we may be allowed to explain it fo ; and though the greater Fontanelle was thought to prefent in labour, this back Fontanelle is the true pre- fenting point. (c) Marks a fmall Fontanelle, or membraneous interftice before the ear; and (d) Marks another fmall Fontanelle behind the ear, in the place of the Additamentum Suturae Squamofae; and it is the more to be remarked, as it is through this little Fontanelle, that the accoucheur opens the head in the rare coincidence of preternatural pofture of the child, and deformed Pelvis; where after delivering the body, it is impoflible to get the head out: and he prefers this opening, and fhuns the back Fontanelle, left, in piercing there, he ihould cut the ligament of the neck, and fo lofe his hold of the head.

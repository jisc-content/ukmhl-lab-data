FIGURE OIC THE BONES. aS FIGURE V. p-ir* L WO Dorfal Vertebrae are here feen in their right pofition, conne&ed by the interver- tebral fubftance ; with the end of one rib in its place; and at (h) is feen one arti- culating furface on the body of the vertebra naked. At (c) is feen the articulating furface, upon the face of the Tranfverfe Procefs, naked. At (zf) is feen the head of the rib covering the two articulating furfaces ; connefled at (e) with the body, and at (f) with the Tranfverfe Procefs of its own vertebra. FIGURE VI. Xs a drawing of the Intervertebral Substance, which is of that ambiguous nature, that anatomifts choofe this name, to avoid the dilemma of calling it either Cartilage or Ligament, when it has not the chara&er diftin&ly either of Cartilage or of Ligament. It is Ihown here as it is found betwixt the Lumbar Vertebrae; and the concentric circles of which it confifts are better exprefied towards the margin (g) ; but towards the centre, and efpecially in the very middle, it becomes foft, pulpy, the circles confuf- ed. The fubftance is fo much fofter in the centre, that there is almoft a hole at (£) ; efpecially when the bone is allowed to fpoil a little, as this one was. At (z) is feen a flight indication of the Spinal marrow, (which was alfo corrupted,) going down through the great hole of the vertebra. THE THIRD ROW. Explains the forms of the Atlas and Dentatus ; the two Vertebrae by which almoft f •I all the motions of the head are performed. Fig. VII. explains the Atlas; Fig. VIII. explains the Dentatus ; Fig. IX, fhows the way in which the Atlas fits down upon the tooth-like procefs and oblique fhoulders of the Dentatus.

OF THE JOINTS. Scaphoid Cavity of the Radius (.1). The moveable Cartilage, fmall and Triangular, which reprefents the head of the Ulna in this joint (t), points out the oval form of this cavity by circumfcribing it; (u) fhows the round head of the Os Scafhoides ; (<y) fhows a fimilar round Articulating Surface of the Os Lunare ; and it is here feen, that thefe two are the chief bones on the part of the Carpus, and that they form together an o-val head, which, correfponding with the oval form of the Sca- phoid Cavity of the Radius (r), makes the wrifl-joint a regular hinge, not capable of lateral motions. The Capfule of the wrifl which inclofes thefe bones, to form them into a joint, is feen here with its cut edges marked (t) ; for the lines from (i) ferve at once to circum- fcribe the joint, explaining its oval form, and to mark the cut edges of its Capfule.

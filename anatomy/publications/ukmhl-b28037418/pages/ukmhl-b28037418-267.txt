D T H I R o B K O OP THE o I N T this book feem fliort, it is becaufe I have omitted many joints, which it is decent and proper for the profeffed anatomift to be acquainted with, but which it were very fuperfiuous to trouble the ftudent about, for the fubjedt is hardly even curious, and certainly not ufeful. Therefore 1 have made a fuller defcription of the Ihoulder, knee, and hip; ard have refrained from giving any drawings of the joints of the head, of the Vertebrae, or of the ribs; for thefe joints are not eafily under- llood, are hardly worth remembering, and are very foon forgotten. It was natural for me to be afraid left the hiflory and drawings of thefe joints might fwell the book, making it more expenfive, and lefs ufeful. PLATE

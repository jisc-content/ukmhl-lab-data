6o OF THE BONES. FIGURE IV. Z S a drawing of the Fibula, which is a long {lender bone, fo extremely fimple in its form, that there needs be no further defcription than this, that the {haft of the bone (q) is exceedingly {lender, is much longer than the Tibia,—and is triangular like the Tibia. The upper end (r) is laid under the projecting head of the Tibia, at (u Fig. III.) and it is laid flat upon it; fo that this articulating and fmooth furface (r) is fmooth only for the fake of a very flight degree of fhuffling motion. The lower end (s) is the larger.—It unites with the lower end of the Tibia (p Fig. III.) to form the ancle joint. This guards the ancle joint without, as the Procefs of the Tibia guards it within. And this fmooth articulating furface (t) is for receiving the fide of the Aftragalus, that bone of the foot by which chiefly the ancle joint is formed. PLATE

200K SECOND, PLATE EIGHTH. *35 ii PLATE , The tendency of the Oblique fibres of the Abdominal Mufcle to fplit is eafily feen, and the manner of its fpliting to form the Ring of the Abdominal Muscles is faithfully reprefented, where (d) marks the lower pillar of the ring ; (e) the upper pillar of the ring; and it is plain that (^.) while it forms the lower pillar of the ring, is at the fame time the Ligament of the thigh, (f) Marks the Spermatic Cord coming through the opening of the ring (y) marks the femoral Artery coming from under Paupartâ€™s Ligament, or the Ligament of the thigh. Whence it will be underltood how Bubonocele or Hernia of the Groin, following the courfe of the Spermatic Cord, will proceed obliquely inwards, and mull (in attempting to re- duce it), be pulhed from within outwards: and how a femoral Hernia will by coming out from under the femoral Ligament, be lodged fairly in the thigh, far from the Groin; lying very deep, apt to be concealed from the Surgeon; and how by following the courfe of the great veflels of the thigh, the Femoral Hernia will proceed from within obliquely outwards, fo that, in attempting to reduce this Hernia, we mull pulli from without obliquely inwards.

BOOK SECOND, PLATE FIRST. 87 the Dura Mater where it forms the periofteum of the Orbit ; the Dura Mater gra- dually a (Taming the nature of a common tendon, from which thole three mufcles arife. The place where this tendon begins, is the inner end of that Foramen Lacerum which belongs to the Sphoencid Bone, and which admits the fmaller nerves to enter for the mufcles of the eye; for when the Dura Mater has come out by this hole from the Cranium into the Orbit, it afiumes, juft where it covers that hole, a hard and tendinous nature, becomes white, aftumes the appearance of a tendon, and is in fadt, the common Tendon by which three of the mufcles arife ; and as this hole is below the Optic Nerve, and toward the outer fide of it, the mufcles which arife by this common tendon are chiefly thofe which pull the eye outwards or down- wards ; and fo this common tendon gives origin to the Abdudtor, Deprimens and Addudtor. But thofe mufcles again which cover the upper part of the Optic Nerve, arife clofe round the margin of the Optic hole ; they touch the nerve and a*dhere to it; by ad- hering to the nerve, they may be faid to arife from the nerve or from that Angle of the Dura Mater where it comes through the Optic hole, to go over the Optic Nerve. So the Levator and the Obliquus Superior arife from the Dura Mater, where it forms the (heath of the Optic Nerve ; while the Deprimens, Abdudtor, and Addudtor, arife by one common tendon from the Dura Mater where it covers the Foramen Lacerum, forming the periofteum of the orbit. This is all feen at (a), Figures XII. and XIII. where (a) (hows the fringed edge of the Dura Mater furrounding the root of the Optic Nerve ; (#) the origins of the Levator and Obliquus Superior, in the angle where the Dura Mater turns backwards. And (r) (liows the origin of the Abductor and Deprimens coming from the Periofteum of the Foramen Lacerum, a little to one fide of the great Nerve. The only other difficult point, and which is more important (till, fince it explains the relative fiz.e, and fhape, and courfe of thefe mufcles, is the true place of this central

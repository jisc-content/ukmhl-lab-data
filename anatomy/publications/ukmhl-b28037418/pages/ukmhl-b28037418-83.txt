BOOK FIRST, PLATE FIFTH. 35 (Ethmoidal Bone. There is incafed betwixt (c c) the Orbitary Plates of the Frontal Bone, the Cri- briform plate of the (Ethmoidal Bone;—where (//) marks the Cribiform Plate with its numerous fmall holes for tranfmitting the Olfactory Nerves, (<?) Marks the Crilta Galli, whence the Falx begins. (J~) Points to that hole which is called the Blind Hole, wdiich is as fmall as a pin’s point, and which belongs in common to the (Ethmoidal and Frontal Bones. N. B. The fmall crack, to which the lines running downwards from (cP) point, and which indicates the Suture furrounding the (Ethmoidal Bone and named (Eth- moidal Suture, can hardly be miltaken. Spiioenoidal Bone. The Sphenoid Bone is known here by its two proceffes named Transver.se Spi- nous, or Little Wings of Ingrasias marked^); the lines from the letter (g~) point to the Sphoenoidal Suture^, which feparate* this Bone from the Frontal and C £ ana *c£ (Ethmoid Bones, (h IP) Mark the two Anterior (Ethmoid Proceffes. (z) Marks the Pofterior Clinoid Procefs ; for it is rather one Procefs terminating in two little horns or knobs. (k) Is fet down in the Sella Turcica in the very centre of the Cli- noid Proceffes where the Pituitary Gland is lodged. (/ /) Mark the two Optic Holes, which are fcarcely feen, for they lie under the twTo Anterior Clinoid pro- ceffes, fo as to be almoft hidden by them : -—The two lines going from the letter, (m) mark the two wide grooves, which are formed by the Carotid Arteries as they rife by the fides of the Sella Turcica ; and the letter (m) itfelf fits upon a large groove made by the Optic Nerves, where they enter into the Optic Holes.

The Glenoid or Articulating Cavity, which is particularly fmall and fuperficial, confidering how large the head of the fhoulder bone is. (j-) The Neck of the Scapula fo called ; it is the fmaller part which fupports the head, though, properly fpeaking, there is no neck;—and when the head of the Ihoulder bone is faid, in a luxation, to lie upon the neck of the Scapula, it lies upon the place marked (g). .(8.) The Spine of the Scapula, which divides the upper furface, and which, riling higher as it goes forwards, terminates at laft in the Acromion Procefs. (9.) Is the Acromion Procefs ; it is juft the end of the fpine, which turns its flat fide towards the head of the Ihoulder bone, and overhangs the fhoulder to defend the joint, and prevent luxations upwards. (10.) And there is ftill a farther fecurity ; for the Coracoid Procefs (10) Hands upon the inner fide of the joint, and defends it within.

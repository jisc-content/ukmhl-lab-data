71 E001C FIRST, PLATE TWELFTH. PLATE XII. This Plate explains the ’Text Book, from Page 17 7, to Page 190. Explains the Radius and Ulna, Carpus and Fingers. FIGURE I. In ■the drawing of the Os Humeri, all the defcriptions and letters belonging to the laft plate belong equally to this. This drawing were fuperfluous, but for the impor- tant purpofe of ihowing the back part of the articulating furface, where we do not find that round furface marked (n) in the laft plate, and which is called the Lefler Head of the Humerus, but only the hinge-like furface for the articulation of the Ulna. And the chief objeft of this drawing, is to Ihow, that here alfo upon the back part of the bone, there is a deep hollow' betwixt the Condyles ; on the fore part of the bone the hollow is for receiving the Coronoid Procefs of the Ulna, which checks into that hollow w'hen the arm is bent forwards; but here upon the back part, this deep hol- low, marked (13,) receives the Olecranon, or great procefs of the Ulna, when the arm is extended. It is alfo to be obferved; that in this drawing the twilled form of the bone is well exprefted and truely, not caricatured; for the edge does in fa£l turn thus / round. 2 FIGURE

The bone has thefe points of description-. Jimtitruf (1.) Is the great cavity,, which receives the lower end of the wdirrs to form the elbow joint, and this is called the Greater Sigmoid cavity. (2.) The Olecranon, a large tubercle which marks the point of the elbow upon which we reft, and guards the Sigmoid Cavity behind. (3.) The Coronary Procefs which Hands up, and guards the Sigmoid Cavity before. (4.) The Hollow, where the fide of the Smaller button-like head of the Radius rolls, called the Lefier Sigmoid Cavity. (5.) The Prominent Roughnefs, into which the tendon of the Brachialis Internus is im- planted ; and it leads to the Iharp ridge. (6.) The Sharp Ridge, from which the Inter-ofleous Membrane goes off. (7.) The Lower Head of the Ulna, which is fmall, and button-like; for it is received into a hollow on the fide of the Radius, and it is upon this point, viz. the little head of the Ulna, that the radius turns in the continual motions of the hand. Is the Styloid Procefs of the Ulna, which is pointed, as the name implies ; from it ligaments go off to ftrengthen the joint cf the wrift. FIGURE III. JELXplains the relative pofition of the Radius and Ulna. The Ulna is marked with figures according with the above defcription; the Radius is alfo marked with its points of demonftration. 1. («. a. «.)

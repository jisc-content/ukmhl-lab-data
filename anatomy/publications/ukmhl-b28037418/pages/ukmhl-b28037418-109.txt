49 BOOK FIRST, PLATE THIRD. FIGURE VII, Explains the Atlas, or-firft Vertebra, where we find, (i,) The body entirely wanting, and the place of the body fupplied by Articulating Sur- faces (2, 2), fo large as to give fufficient ftrength and thlcknefs to the fides of the ring. V. B. At the place where the body flrould be, there is at (^) a fmooth Articulating Sur- face for the Tooth-like Procefs of the Atlas rolling. There is at (/) a little tip or point, which is tied by ligaments to the margin of the Occipital Hole; at (m) there is a fort of ftraitening in the ring, and at this point a ligament goes acrofs the ring, di- viding it into two, and holding firm the tooth-like procefs. (2.9 The Oblique or Articulating Procefles of this vertebra are oval, and of a converging form; and this peculiarity in their diredtion limits the motions of the head, fo that it 4 cannot turn, but only nod, upon the Atlas. (3.) The Spinous Procefs is wanting. A fmall knob reprefents the fpinous procefs ; and the want of this fpine enables the Atlas to turn freely in circles upon the Dentatus. (4.) The Tranfverfe Procefs, alfo ending in a little knob, and perforated by the large hole for the Vertebral Artery. FIGURE VIIL rf"’’ J HE Dentatus, where the points of defcription are, (i.J) The whole body of the Vertebra, riling gradually towards the apex or point of its axis or tooth-like procefs, which is marked (m). (2.) The broad flat articulating furfaces, like fhoulders, at the root of the tooth-like pro- cefs ; upon which the atlas refts and turns. G 3. The

BOOK SECOND, PLATE TWELFTH. I53 U The tendons of the little mufcle the Extensor. Brevis Digitorum Pedis (195.)? which is feen lying under the tendons of the long mufcle. Behind the Extenfor Digitorum, and hiding it in part, is the Peroneus Longus Mufcle ('184.), which belongs to the brawn of the Leg, and the tendon of which pafies down behind the outer ancle. In the foot, Fig. II. lying under this one, is explained the Plantar Aponeurofis, or that fafcia which belongs to the foie of the foot; and which is defcribed in the Book of Mufcles, page 382. It is feen here to coniift of three general divifions, the middle one (7), the lateral one f/£) on the outfide, which covers the Flexor, and the Abdudtor Minimi Digiti; and the lateral one (/) on the infide, which covers the Flexor and the Abduclor Pollicis. The general Fafcia where it covers the thigh is marked (f), but it is merely a con- tinuation of the fame fafcia that covers the leg ; and where it covers the leg it is marked (*) ; and it is Hill the fame fafcia which being continued over the fore-part of the foot, is there ilrengthened by its adhefion to the outer and inner ancles, by which, taking a new form it becomes the Annular Ligament, fo that the Annular Ligament is merely a llrengthening of the common fafcia. FIGURE III. This view fhows chiefly the mufcles upon the back part of the thigh and leg. Th& Vertical Seftion of the Os Sacrum is marked (m) ; the hollow of the Pelvis is marked («) ; the Vertical Seftion of the Os Pubis is marked (0) ; and the letter G>) is put down upon the Tuberofity of the Os Ifchium, which could not be clear- ly marked. And the mufcles are. The Psoas Magnus (157.) ; croffing the brim of the Pelvis, to go down into the thigh. The Gracilis (176.), which is feen coming from the arch of the Pubis, and going down to be inferted by a delicate and flender tendon, into the head of the Tibia,

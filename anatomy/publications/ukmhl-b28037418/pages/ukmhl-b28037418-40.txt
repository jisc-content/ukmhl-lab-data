2 OF THE BONF..S. FIGURE I. THE ADULT SCULL. A The Frontal Bone, where (a) {hows the ferrated edge which forms the Co- ronal Suture; (£) the flatter part behind the Eye, which is plain and hollow for lodging the Temporal Mufcle; (c) is the acute angle of the bone, which is • called the External Angular Procefs, from its forming the outer angle or cor- ner of the eye; and (i) is that prominence over the nofe, under which there is a fmall cavity within the bone, called the Frontal Sinus, which the furgeon avoids in performing the operation of trepan; though it is rather from the difficulty of perforating this part that he Ihuns it, than from any danger in the perforation. B The Parietal Bone. The letter B points to that great line, which running ac- cording to the length of the bone, with a rainbow-like arch, divides the fur- face into two equal parts, of which the upper and fmooth-part (y) is covered with the thin expanded tendon of the Occifito-Frontalis Muscle, while the lower part (y_) has its furface radiated; and thefe radii are the impreflions of the particular bundles of which the Temporal Mufcle confifts; fo that “ the white (l femicircular line (B) reprefents the origin of the temporal mufcle; and the con- verging lines on the furface (_/) exprefs the manner, in which the fibres of “ the mufcle are gathered into a fmaller compafs to pafs under the jugum.” N Vid. P. 61.— (^) points to a fmall hole in the back part of this bone, which is fometimes large, fometimes wanting; and which gives paflfage to a fmall vein of the integuments, (going inwards to the longitudinal finus or great vein of the head) and alfo to a fmall artery, which accompanies the vein : (£) marks that corner which, running down fharper and longer into the temple, is often 2 called

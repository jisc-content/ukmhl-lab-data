OF THE BONES. 4Â° B. The Parietal Bone, and the letter is fo placed as to mark that femicircular ridge where the Temporal Mufcle arifes. C. Marks the Temporal Bone. Where (d) marks the Meatus Auditorius ; (e) the Maftoid Procefs ; (f) the Zygoma; and (g) a Double Squamous Suture, as in the fcull from which this was drawn. D. Marks the Cheek bone where all its connexions are feen; (h) with the Temporal bone ; (i) with the Frontal Bone; (k) with the upper Jaw Bone. E. Marks the Wing of the Sphoenoid Bone, where it lies in the Squamous Suture ; and the four corners of bone forming the Squamous Suture, are (7) the corner of the Sphoenoid (m) the corner of the Parietal; (n) the corner of the Temporal; and (o) the Corner of the Frontal Bone. F. Marks the Small Bone of the Nofe, where the middle Nafal Suture is feen. G. Points to the Upper Jaw Bone. The letter is placed upon the Alveolar or Socket Procefies ; and the fmall letter (p) marks the Infra Orbitary Hole. H Marks the Lower Jaw Bone, this letter touching the point of the chin ; while the fmall letter (q) marks the line of the bails of the lower jaw; (r) the mark of the Maffeter Mufcle, the point into which it is inferted; (s') the Mental Hole by which a twig of the lower Maxillary Nerve comes out upon the face, juft as the twig of the upper Maxillary Nerve comes out upon the face by the Infra Orbitary Hole, at (p). In the Orbit, (t) marks the holes, which being within the orbit, (for arteries and nerves pafling down into the noftril,) are called Internal Orbitary Holes, to diftinguifh them from the Supra Orbitary and Infra Orbitary Holes. Of thefe internal Orbitary Holes, make each plate fyftematic and orderly in itfelf, without reference to any other plate. And fo in each plate the great letters point to the general Bone, and the lefler alphabet marks and arranges the individual parts.

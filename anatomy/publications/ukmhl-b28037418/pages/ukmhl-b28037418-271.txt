BOOK THIRD, PLATE FIRST. 169 form from the manner in which it is cut; the edges of the cut Capfule are ftill feen furrounding the ihoulder bone, as well as the Glenoid Cavity; and this throwing back of the Capfule Ihows the ihallownefs of the Glenoid Cavity (p), and the roundnefs and largenefs of the head of the ihoulder bone ; and within the Capfule is feen the long head (2) of the biceps, riiing from the margin of the focket, at its upper part. (k) Marks the remains of the tendon of the Supra-fpinatus Mufcle, where it lies upon the Capfule and adheres to it; and it is this tendon which gives the Capfule an appearance of thicknefs, and makes it turn fo rigidly backwards at this particular point (&). FIGURE III. May be compared with figure i. to obferve how entirely the joint is furrounded with its great mufcles : For here is the Infra-fpinatus covering the Capfule, juft as the Subfcapularis does in figure i. But the chief ufe of this figure is to give a true notion of one of the greateft Burfae Mucofse that belong to the Ihoulder joint. The Parts marked in this drawing are, The bafis of the Scapula (a) ; the beginning of the Spine of the Scapula (b); the Acromion Procefs (c) ; the Clavicle (d) ; the ligament which ties the outer end of the clavicle firmly to the point of the Acromion Procefs (r) ; the point or apex of the Coracoid Procefs (f) ; the fliaft of the ihoulder bone (g). But the head of the ihoulder bone is concealed by the mufcles, and other foft parts. Then, of the foft parts there are feen chiefly thefe, The great belly of the Infra- spina- tus Mufcle (74.), where it lies upon the Scapula black and Alining; (for every mufcle when' diflected clean, has a metally-like furface) the belly of the Teres Minor (75.), the tendon of which twifts to be implanted thus into the ihoulder bone at (Â£). The ftiort head of the biceps ([h) is feen rifing from the point of the Coracoid Procefs Y Cf),

86 OF THE MUSCLES. MUSCLES OF THE EYE. Figures XII. and XIII. of Plate II. Explain the Mufcles of the Eye. The origin of the Mufcles at the bottom of the Orbit, being once underllood, all their mechanifm will be very plain and eafy, for this fingle point has been the chief diffi- culty from the firft. Galen counted the Levator Palpebrae, as one of the proper mufcles of the eye; Vefalius underllood better than Galen the origin of the Re£li Mufculus from the bottom of the Orbit, but like Galen he has drawn the eye from Brutes, and has defcribed its mufcles, and drawn them in fo confufed a way, that it is not eafy to comprehend that mufcle of his, “ which adheres in all its “ courfe to the Optic Nerve. (Septimus Oculi Mufculus, nulla ex parte a viforio “ nervo liberatus.”) But even after this difcovery of the true origin of thefe mufcles, one author of very high reputation, Mr Lieutaud, denied the origin of thefe mufcles around the root of the Optic Nerve; believing [that the fixed point, or center of all thefe mufcles, was a point a little to the outer fide of that hole, by which the Optic Nerve enters the focket. But now this point, of their general origin from the bottom of the focket, is univerfally acknowledged; and the chief difpute is, whether thefe five mufcles, in arifing round the root of the Optic Nerve, begin from the periofteum of the focket ; or from the bone itfelf, or from the outer coat (the Dura Mater) of the Optic Nerve ; or whether they do not arife by a particular ring, which furroutids the root of the Optic Nerve; for Valfava believed that thefe mufcles began by a fort of ring, which as if furrounded the root of the Optic Nerve, he chofe to call Circulus Moderato- rius Nervi Optici. But in this difpute, as ufually happens, both parties are right, and both are in fome degree wrong ; for two of the five mufcles arife more properly from tDe cuter coat of the Optic Nerve, while the three others arife plainly from the

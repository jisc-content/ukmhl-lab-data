BOOK FIRST, PLATE TENTH. 65 is fupported under the weight of the whole body, both by the particular ligaments belonging to the individual joints of the foot,—and more particularly by the Great Fafcia or ligament, (I would call it,) of the foie of the foot, which from one point (the heel) extends to the root of each toe individually. But there is alfo a fecond and particular arch, which the bones of the Tarfus form among themfelves. This arch is explained by fhowing a large central hole, which is ex- preffed in each of thefe drawings, and is marked (0).—In Fig. IV. there is only a darknefs lhowing where this central hole is.—In Fig. V. the hole is feen fair (by the Tarfus being turned round, and is marked (0). In Fig. VI. it is explained by a broken pencil, (0) thruft up through this central opening.

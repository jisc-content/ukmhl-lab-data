BOOK THIRD, PLATE FIRST. l6j The Biceps (78.) is marked in the bellies with its proper number, and its two heads are alfo marked; the fhorter head (b) riling from the Coracoid Procefs ; and the longer head (7), coming down from within the cavity of the joint. The Coraco-Brachialis ("72*), is feen hanging down loofe and flaccid, from the Cora- coid Procefs, and palling obliquely under the two heads of the Biceps ; to be fixed into the arm bone. The Deltoides (71.) is cut away from the Scapula and turned backwards, and it hangs over the arm bone very thick and rnaffy. And this white and fhining ap- pearance upon the inner furface of the Deltoides is from the Cellular Subftance which lies under it being condenfed into fomewhat of the form of a fafcia. And it is from this fafcia, that one of the great Burke Mucofae belonging to this joint rifes. The flelh of the Deltoid is feen at (b), and the fafcia, covering the face of the muf.le, is marked with the number (71.J And lallly, the Latissimus Dorsi ("70.) is feen cut off about fix inches from its infertion into the Ihoulder bone, and left hanging there. (kk~) Wherever they are found, denote the fat which lies in the interftices of the mufcles, and which Ihould not be too curioufly picked away in any part of a difledtion, unlefs it be neceflary for making fome important part very clean and diltindt. The parts more immediately belonging to the joint are thefe. 1. The Acromion Procefs (d) overhangs the joint from above, and prevents luxations upwards. 2. The Coracoid Procefs (e) Hands up on the infide of the arm, to ftrengthen the joint in that diredlion alfo. 3. The Ligamentum Proprium Triangulare Scapula: (m) crofles from the Ac- romion to the Coracoid Procefs, makes a fort of bridge betwixt them, and keeps all firm in that dire&ion. 4. Another ligament is feen here, the Ligamentum Commune Trafezoides («), which does not rightly belong to this joint, being but a ligament of the Clavicle; f©

-g. OF THE JOINTS. 2 And Ligament, and in contaft witiy; yet being before it, is named the Anterior Liga- ment. The reafon of this Anterior Ligament being reprefented as coming fo far forwards as to touch in a manner the root of the Patella, is plainly this ; that to take a fure hold of the Tibia it does actually rife over the tubercle in the center of the joint, and goes •out flat over all the face of the joint, and the reafon of the Pofterior Ligament feeming to follow this one, and to come alfo far forwards in the joint, is, that the ligaments of the horns of the Lunar Cartilages climb upon the fore-part of the Pofterior Liga- ment, and fo it is more properly the Ligament of the Lunar Cartilage that is feen at (a), while the head only of the Pofterior Crucial Ligament is feen at (/). Eut both the true direction and extent of thefe ligaments and their true office will be better underftood by the following plan ; for there is this one thing very lingular in the effeft of thefe ligaments, that it is not the Pofterior Ligament that checks the leg and prevents it going too far forwards ; nor the Anterior Ligament that prevents it being ftrained backwards,but quite the reverfe ; for the Pofterior Ligament is mofl ftretched when the knee is bended ; the Anterior Ligament again is ftretched when the leg is extended. Figure I. Shows the leg extended. Figure II. Shows the knee bent. In Figure ift, («) is the Thigh-bone ; (i) the Inner Condyle ; (c) the Outer Condyle ; (d) the head of the Tibia; (e) the knob in the center of the Knee-joint; and (i)is the Anterior Ligament arifing from the Outer Condyle, (viz. the one neareft the eye in this drawing), and going out over the fore-part of the Tibia, and inferted properly into that hollowr (/’), which receives the Condyle; (2) is the Pofterior Ligament, rifing rather from the center of the Thigh-bone betwixt the Condyles, and going 4own over the back-part of the Tibia at (g),

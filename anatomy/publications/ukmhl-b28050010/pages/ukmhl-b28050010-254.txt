From this point the phrenic nerve arises, Fig. 19, and passes to the lateral side of the parietal coelom and lung. In a later stage it reaches the septum transversum through the pleuro-pericardial membrane of Uskow. I have now followed the transformation of the relatively simple coelom of the head and neck from the time it is well formed in an embryo of the end of the second week to the end of the third week. During this time the pericardial coelom Fig. 21.â€”Sagittal section through an embryo, 5 mm. long.

During the fourth week both of these membranes appear, but they are not well defined until the fifth week. Fig. 22 is from a profile reconstruction of Embryo II, show- ing the relation of the organs to one another. A cast of the colon of this embryo is given in Fig. 23. The extreme ventral kinking of the heart is shown in this stage and from now on

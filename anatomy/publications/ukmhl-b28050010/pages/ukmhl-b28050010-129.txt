123 cephalic anatomy promises to regain the important position which it occupied prior to the advent of the discoveries in histological methods which attracted the great majority of original workers in the latter part of the nineteenth century. II. While engaged in the study of this fissure, I followed out the suggestions of Professor Wilder and tabulated the number of confluences and separations in one hundred brains taken from dissecting-room subjects in the Medical Department of Columbia University. For this privilege I am indebted to Professor G. S. Huntington and Dr. B. B. Gallaudet, chief demonstrator of anatomy. In the classification of these results I follow Professor Wilder’s method, namely, that of distributing all possible conditions under four heads, as follows : Class I. Deft continuity, right separation. Class II. Left and right continuity. Class III. Left and right separation. Class IV. Left separation, right continuity. In the present researches the results obtained were : Class I, Class II, Class III, Class IV, 32 per cent. 45 per cent. 17 per cent. 6 per cent. There is a continuity in sixty-four per cent, of all hemicere- brums, and separation in thirty-six per cent., as follows: Continuity. Separation. Left hemicerebrum Right hemicerebrum 77 per cent. 51 per cent. 23 per cent. 49 per cent. Continuity and separation were symmetrical (i. e., upon both halves of the same brain) in sixty-two per cent., while asymmetrical conditions prevailed in the remaining thirty- eight per cent. For convenience of comparison I present a table showing in the first column Professor Wilder’s figures derived from

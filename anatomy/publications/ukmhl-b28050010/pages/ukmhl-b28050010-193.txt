177 THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE GALL-BLADDER. By Mervin T. Sudler, Ph. D., M. D., Instructor in Anatomy, Johns Hopkins University. During the past few years the development of the surgery of the gall-bladder and ducts has increased the interest in their finer anatomy, and various investigations have been undertaken in order to add to our knowledge in regard to their structure. TheTymphatics and finer blood-supply, how- ever, do not seem to have had the same attention as the mus- culature and nerve supply; and so this paper deals more with this part of its structure and its histology than those which have been carefully considered in other papers. The results mentioned here were obtained for the most part by the use of the gall-bladders of dogs and pigs. They were used because of their suitability and the ease with which they could be obtained. A limited number from cats and beeves were used also. The results thus obtained from fresh material were verified or refuted upon human gall- bladders as far as the limited supply and general bad condi- tion of them allowed. Within a few hours after death the bile stains and macerates the tissues so that they are quite changed. The mucous membrane disappears entirely in from five to six hours after death; the nuclei and tissues under it refuse to stain, and it is impossible to obtain satisfactory results from any but the freshest material. For the histology small pieces hardened, distended and contracted in saturated corrosive sublimate solution yielded material that stained well and gave good pictures. For the connective-tissue elements the most striking picture was obtained by the use of Yan GiesoiTs acid fuchsin and picric acid, but Wcigertâ€™s elastic

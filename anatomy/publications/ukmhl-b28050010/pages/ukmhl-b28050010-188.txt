172 tube is united by a nut (J, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) either to the nozzle of the tank or to the L-shaped tube mentioned above. The machine is thus very readily attached. On the top of the axial tube the freezing stage (A, Fig. 1. A-C, Fig. 2) is screwed. This stage piece consists of two B Fig. 1. A. Cover of freezing stage. B. Glass track for carrying knife. E.

The base is the part screwed into the upper end of the axial tube (C, Fig. 2). To this base the cover-piece is screwed (A, Fig. 2). Between the base oi' the stage and the axial tube is placed a thin brass plate (D, Fig. 2) with a very narrow aperture at its centre. Through this narrow aperture the carbon-dioxide escapes

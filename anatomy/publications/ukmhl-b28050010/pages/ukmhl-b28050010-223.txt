3. I have mentioned methods by which the model is greatly strengthened during the course of reconstruction, the use of pins, of wire netting and of wire. All three means may he employed thoroughly to strengthen the model after the first rough reconstruction. The wire screening is then especially valuable. Of course it is possible to add free hand and with a good deal of accuracy structures which from their delicacy are difficult to model. This is true of blood-vessels, nerves and of fine membranes. The blood-vessels and nerves may be readily constructed by covering copper wire with wax, the membranes by covering a netting of narrow meshes with a thin coating of wax. In rounding and smoothing up various structures in a model so as to give it a finished appearance, semi-melted wax applied with the fingers or with a spatula is of the greatest help. The model is greatly protected in many ways by a thick coating of paint. Hot weather seems to have a far less detri- mental effect on such models than on models unpainted. fYe have found photography of great help not only in re- cording the condition of the finished model but also, at times, during the course of a reconstruction.

162 was cut into thin segments in a plane nearly parallel to the occipital sulcus (Affenspalte), as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, and stained by the Marchi method. It was my endeavor to make the plane of section correspond as nearly as possible to the course of the projection fibres through the internal capsule. Description of the Lesion. The portion of cortex removed was circular and about one cm. in diameter. About one-third of the area of the lesion was in the ascending parietal convolution and the other two- thirds in the ascending frontal. Its posterior extremity was about midway between the lowest portion of the interparietal sulcus and the fissure of Rolando, while its anterior boundary j was the superior angle of the sulcus precentralis. The lowest portion of the lesion was very nearly opposite the lower extremity of the interparietal sulcus, and it extended upward to the superior frontal sulcus.% The lesion in the ascending frontal was much more shallow than in the ascending parietal and the entire cortical substance was removed only at that portion of the ascending parietal convolution nearest the centre of the lesion, close to the fissure of Rolando. It was at this point that uncomplicated flexion of the thumb was obtained on stimulation with a weak faradic current. The portion of cortex removed became thinner from the centre to the periphery of the lesion. In the hardened brain there was evidence of slight cerebral hernia, i. e. bulging of the brain into the opening in the skull, which accounts for the irregularitv of contour in Fig. 3. In Figs. 1 and 2 I have endeavored to show the distribu- tion of association fibres to the external surface of the two hemispheres, the proximity of the oblique parallel lines to each other corresponding to the amount of degeneration found in the various convolutions. It was impossible to 1,11 In Fig. 1 the lesion does not extend upward as far as it should. It is better represented in Fig 3.

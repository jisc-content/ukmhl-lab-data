164 fibres could be traced from the internal capsule into the lateral geniculate body, it lies directly in the path of those running to the temporal lobe and there is considerable degen- eration in this nucleus in both hemispheres. Still posterior to this (Fig. 6) degenerated fibres are passing between the islets of gray matter representing the prolongations of the putamen, while many others may be seen passing down among the fibres of the external capsule. The degenerated fibres in the superior temporal convolution are apparently continuous with both these tracts, the course of which is the same in both hemispheres. Taking into consideration the movements represented in that portion of the cortex removed, the distribution of asso- ciation fibres is of especial interest. While the centre for uncomplicated movement of the thumb occupies but a small portion of the area removed, movements of the thumb as part of some associated movement or march may be obtained not only from every portion of that area but also from points considerably removed therefromâ€”even as far down the con- vexity of the brain as the lower extremity of the fissure of Rolando. It is a question of much interest whether this is brought about by means of association fibres or projection fibres passing directly from each of the widely separated cor- tical areas to the system of secondary neurons in the cervical

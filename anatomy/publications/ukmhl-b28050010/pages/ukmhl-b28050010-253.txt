and the liver and stomach into the peritoneal coelom. The dnctns Cnvieri lies in a ridge of tissue encircling the canal of communication between the pericardial and pleural coelom. In this embryo the ridge has no mesentery, as described by His (Fig. 18), but in sagittal sections of the same stage (CXXXVI) the mesentery is present. As yet there is no indication of a line of separation between the pleural and peritoneal coelom in LXXX, but in OXXXYI there is an elevation on the dorsal'wall of the pleural coelom, Fig. 21, which encircles the lung and joins the dorsal end of the Fig. 20.—Section through embryo LXXX, .26 mm. deeper than Fig. 19 x 25 times; (76, sixth cervical myotome; a, aorta; cv, cardinal vein; 5, stomach; ?«, umbilical vein ; Ipc, lower peritoneal cavity. septum transversum. This is one of the pillars of Uskow or the beginning of a ridge which I shall term the pulmonary ridge. Fig. 20, compared with Fig. 13, shows that the foramen of Winslow has moved more rapidlv towards the tail than the heart. A section through it strikes the heart squarely in one case, while in the other it does not touch the heart but strikes the liver only. This is in part due to the direction of the section in the two specimens, and in part to the shift- ing of the foramen of Winslow with the recession of the

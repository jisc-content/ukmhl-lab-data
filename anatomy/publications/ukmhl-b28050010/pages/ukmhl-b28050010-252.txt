230 exception of the lesser peritoneal cavity, which is now more to the caudal side of the lungs. While in the embryo 4.3 mm. long the myotomes were well formed and hollow, in the embryo 4.5 they are solid and contain embryonic muscle fibres. The dorsal ganglia are also more developed. In the embryos 5 mm. long (LXXX and CXXX.VI) the myotomes are still further differentiated with nerve trunks, composed of both dorsal and ventral roots.

Figs. 17-20 give the general form of this embryo, in reconstruction as well as in section. The septum transversum is not as per- pendicular as in either younger or older stages (LXXYI and II), but in general -this embryo is intermediate between them. A separation between the pericardial and pleural coelom now begins to make its appearance by means of a constriction in its walls, the ductus Cuvieri encircling the coelom at this point. The lung buds hang free into the pleural coelom,

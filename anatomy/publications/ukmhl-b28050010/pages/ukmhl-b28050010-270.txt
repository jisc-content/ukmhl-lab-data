With the recession of the septum transversum, especially at its dorsal end, the evagination of the coelom containing the Fig. 43.—Section through the opening between the pleural and peritoneal cavities in the embryo 14 mm. long x 50 times; s, stomach; l, lung;j»j9, pleuro-peritoneal membrane; ad, adrenal. liver and stomach is complete, throwing them into the general peritoneal cavity. Figs. 39, 40 and 41 are sections through the pleuro-peri- cardial and pleuro-peritoneal membranes of Embryo CIX. Fig. 38. They give the relation of the pleuro-pericardial and pleuro-peritoneal membranes to the surrounding structures. The heart is now in its permanent location in the thorax and

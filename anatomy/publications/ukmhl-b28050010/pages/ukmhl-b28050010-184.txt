6 Beevor and Horsley, Phil. Trans. Royal Society, B. 1890. 1G8 exactly the same point in all the animals experimented upon. Most were primary, though sometimes secondary or tertiary. No purely primary movement was observed of the elbow or the fingers. On stimulation of the cortex of the orang ontang the same investigators 6 observed opening of the eyes and turning the head and eyes to the opposite side represented in the same area, or rather in that part of it anterior to the fissure of Rolando. This march, it will be seen, is also represented within this area in the Bonnet, though not so clearly brought out as in the latter. It is of especial interest in connection with the considerable degree of degeneration found, in the experiment here described, in the superior temporal convolu- tion, now well established as the auditory centre. The asso- ciation of this centre with that portion of the cortical area which controls the opening of the eyes followed by syn- chronous movement of the head and eyes would seem to be the anatomical basis of a cortical reflex of primary import- ance to self-preservation, in all wild animals. It is also to be noted that the distribution of these fibres is quite bilateral. The fact that in this case they degenerate toward the auditory centre, instead of from it, may be urged against the supposi- tion that these fibres are a link in this reflex, but the anatom- *

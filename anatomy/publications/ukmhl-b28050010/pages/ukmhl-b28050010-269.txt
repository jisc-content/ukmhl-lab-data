247 About this time the portion of the pulmonary ridge des- tined to become the pleuro-pericardial membrane unites with the root of the lung bud and completely closes the pericardial cavity. Fig. 37. By this union the course of the ductus Cuvieri is from the body-wall to the heart through the pleuro- pericardial membrane, and the plane of the pleuro-pericardial membrane is practically that of the septum transversum, the two together being transverse to the body of the embryo.

The phrenic nerve at this time is in the plane of the septum transversum and reaches its dorsal tip through its projection, the pleuro-pericardial membrane. Immediately after the completion of the pleuro-pericardial membrane the rotation of the liver and septum transversum is accelerated, and by the time the embryo has grown to be 11 mm. long (G7X), the liver is practically in its adult posi- tion. The rapid rotation of the liver, especially at its dorsal end, has changed the relation of the planes between the

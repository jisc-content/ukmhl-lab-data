194 A. Preliminary steps. 1. Obtaining a good picture of the embryo or object to be reconstructed. 2. Hardening, staining and sectioning the object. 3. Drawing magnified enlargements of the sections or such parts of them as it is desired to reconstruct. 4. Preparation of the wax plates. 5. Transference of the image to the surface of the wax and cutting out the wax plates. B. Constructing the model. 1. Piling the wax plates. 2. Bemoving parts not essential to the reconstruction de- sired and rounding off of the parts reconstructed. 3. Strengthening and finishing the model. I shall consider these steps in the order named. A. Preliminary steps. 1. Before proceeding to section the object to be recon- structed it is important to obtain good pictures of its external form. With such a picture at hand it is much easier to pile up the wax plates which represent the sections through the object. This is especially true when the object is symmet- rical, as in the reconstruction of embryos, profile views of which are invaluable in this work. If the picture be enlarged to the magnification of the model desired a valuable control is furnished. A series of parallel lines may then be drawn through the picture to represent the planes through which the knife has passed in sectioning the embryo, so that the position of every plate is indicated. For general purposes photography is undoubtedly the most convenient method of recording the gross external features of the object. If the object be very small as, for instance, an early human embryo, the camera may be so placed that the image in the negative is enlarged from two to four diameters. It is found that the most convenient way of photographing- embryos is to place the camera with the axis in a vertical direction and the lens pointing downwards. A stand for holding the camera in this position and raising or lowering it is easily constructed. Ordinary lead shot seems to be

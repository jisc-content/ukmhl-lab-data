155 eral of these disappear through fusion in the course of devel- opment. Allowing for the possibility that these observers have counted in an occipital segment, there would he in embryos of this size at least thirty-seven trunk segments, which would correspond to thirty-six vertebrae. Iveibel finds in an embryo of 8 mm. thirty-five trunk segments, together with a mass of unsegmented mesoderm, equaling two seg- ments in length. Beckoning this as two instead of one seg- ment, as Iveibel does, we have again thirty-seven segments, corresponding to thirty-six vertebras. The following is an attempt to tabulate the number of segments found in embryos varying in length from 7.5 to 21.5 mm. With the exception of the last column the data are as recorded by the observers themselves. In the last column the number of vertebrae is given which would corre- spond to the total number of segments after certain changes have been made, such as deduction of occipital segments or addition of unsegmented mesoderm, which seemed justified by the descriptions of the authors.

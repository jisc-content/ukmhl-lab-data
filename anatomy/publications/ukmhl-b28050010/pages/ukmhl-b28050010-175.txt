159 BILATERAL RELATIONS OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX. By E. Lindon Mellus, M. D. (From the Anatomical Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University.) in the study of the central nervous system it becomes more and more apparent that the statement that each cerebral hemisphere controls the opposite half of the body must be still further modified. It has long been recognized that cer- tain movements were more or less bilateral; that is, equally controlled by each hemisphere. This is easily demonstrated by electrical stimulation of the cortex and, to a certain extent, the anatomical relations have been worked out. The bilateral representation ot most facial movements would appear at first thought to be quite essential and anatomists held, long before it was demonstrated, that each of the motor nuclei in the pons and medulla was connected with its fellow of the opposite side by decussating fibres. Bilateral movement could thus be accounted for by simultaneous stimulation of the nuclei of both sides, but the results of some of the more recent investigations show that projection fibres run directly from the cortex of each hemisphere to the nuclei of both sides. This provides for simultaneous stimulation, while the fibres passing directly from one nucleus to the other may conserve the symmetrical discharge of energy. The necessity for bilateral control of the limbs is not so evident, but the fibres of the so-called direct or uncrossed pyramidal tract in man and the finding of bilateral degener- ation in the cord after unilateral lesion of the brain seemed to make it probable. For some time it was not possible to trace the course of this homolateral degeneration from the

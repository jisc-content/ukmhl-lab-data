83 Right hemicerebrum, Left hemicerebrum, . Cerebellum, Isthmus, . 555 grams. 563 grams. 109 grams. 57 grams. Total, 1,284 grams. The loss in weight amounted to 218 grams, or 13 per cent, of the original weight. This brain-weight (53 ounces in round numbers) is about 4 ounces, or about 125 grams above the average for one of Dr. E. C. Seguin’s age and height, and his position in the list of brain-weights of eminent men is comparatively high. Owing to the excellent preservative qualities of formalde- hyde, this brain is only'slightly flattened, and the shrinkage amounts to very little. As in the father’s brain, there is a slight but unquestionable exposure of the left preinsula. The left sylvian fissure more nearly approaches the horizontal, and there is a similar ample development of the frontal lobes characteristic of the father’s brain. The indices of the lobes are: Left hemicerebrum: Frontal index, Parietal index, Occipital index, . Right hemicerebrum : Frontal index, Parietal index, Occipital index, . 61 23.6 I5-3 57-2 26.3 16.3 The relatively small index of the occipital lobe is particu- larly noteworthy in both halves of this brain. The left separation and right continuity of the parietol- paroccipital fissures spoken of in the father’s brain are in the son’s brain reversed as to sides. On the right side a well- marked isthmus separates the fissures, on the left they are confluent over a vadum. On the right half the exoccipital fissural complex does not differ very much in its appearances from the left half of the father’s brain, except that the “ troisieme pli” is flush with the cerebral surface and not submerged. The left insula, as in the father’s, is far better developed

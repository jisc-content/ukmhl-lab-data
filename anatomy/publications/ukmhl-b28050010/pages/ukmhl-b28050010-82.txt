82 superior (HOP') and an inferior (EOF"), superficially con- fluent with each other. In both hemicerebrums the occipital lobe exhibits a distinct tendency to overlap the parietal gyres ; the walls of the ex- occipital fissure slope distinctly mesocaudad, suggesting the pomatic homology and derivation of the occipital lobe. The insula on the left side is far better developed than its fellow on the right half, corroborating the statement made by Waldschmidt,6 that in educated men the left insula is “in- comparably richer” in its development than the right. Upon close inspection, and by means of soundings made in the sylvian cleft, this redundancy is found to be most marked in the preinsular region. BRAIN OF DR. EDWARD C. SEGUIN. The autopsy upon the younger Seguin took place on Feb- ruary 21, 1898, and was made by Dr. J. S. Thacher, assisted by Drs. J. Arthur Booth and E. C. Spitzka. Drs. Hallock and Pooley were present. The brain was removed about 30 hours after death, also by Dr. E. C. Spitzka, my father, and to him I am indebted for the opportunity of studying and de- scribing both of these valuable brains, unprecedented in so far as I can find no other instance where the brains of father and son were available (both being of marked characteristics), and the nearest approach being the case of the brothers Leidy, of Philadelphia, undescribed as yet—and at present in the collection of the Anthropometric Society of that city. The appearance and texture of the younger Seguin’s brain were normal. After dissection and draining- the total weight was 1,502 grams, or 52.98 ounces. The parts of the brain while still fresh weighed as follows: Right hemicerebrum, Left hemicerebrum, . Cerebellum, Isthmus, . 642 grams. 653 grams- 140 grams. 67 grams. Total, 1,502 grams. The brain was again weighed 011 December 3, 1900, after nearly three years’ immersion in formaldehyde solution :

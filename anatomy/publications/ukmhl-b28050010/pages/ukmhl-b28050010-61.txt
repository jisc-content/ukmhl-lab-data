61 CONTRIBUTION TO THE OSTEOLOGY OF RIBS. By Dr. Ales Hrdticka, of New York City. [Abstract.] The material examined consists of 1,000 first, 1,200 second and 14,000 other ribs of Prof. Huntington’s collection, and the ribs of numerous Indian skeletons in the American Mu- seum of Natural History, New York City. THE FIRST RIB. (a.) This rib shows considerable differences both in size and shape. Two varieties of shape can be distinguished : the ribs of the first variety are nicely curved and almost semicircular in outline ; the ribs of the second variety show in their course one or two distinct angles. (A) The u scalene” tubercle, or, rather, spine, was found as follows : Completely absent, . Mere trace, . Present, various sizes, Per cent. 210 j approximately, 69.5—Approximately, Per cent. . 30.O . 70.O In 2.0 per cent, of the ribs a distinct double spine was found. The formation of the spine seems to be partly due to the mechanical effect of the contact of the subclavian artery with the first rib. The exact significance and formation of the spine needs further investigation. (c.) On the superior surface of the first rib, near its sternal end, on or near its ventral border, there exists in 16.5 per cent, of the cases a distinct and occasionally prominent tu- berosity, with an articular or, rather, a contact facet for the clavicle. (■d.) The cartilage of the first rib ossifies earlier than any other rib-cartilages ; it also ossifies in another manner than most of these. In other ribs than the first, and possibly the second, the ossification of the cartilage proceeds, especially in one or both borders, on the surface, irregularly from one or a few points and the bone extends gradually over most of the

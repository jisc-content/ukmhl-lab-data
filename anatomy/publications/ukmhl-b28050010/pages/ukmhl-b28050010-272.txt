250 with the peritoneal. In Embryo LXXIV, Fig. 45, the pleuro- peritoneal membrane is complete on the right side and in- complete on the left side. The reconstruction of this embryo shows that the opening is very large and extends from the seventh rib towards the tail. It may be an instance of re- tarded development, because in embryos 19 mm. long the membranes are as a rule complete on both sides of the body. To what extent the permanent diaphragm is formed from the pleuro-peritoneal membrane it is difficult to determine Fig. 45.â€”Transverse section through the embryo 14 mm. long. No. LXXIV x 10 times; 7, seventh rib. The pleuro-peritoneal membrane ; pp, is incomplete on one side. Undoubtedly the portion of the diaphragm on the caudal and dorsal sides of the pleuro-pericardial membrane is formed from the pleuro-peritoneal membrane. That portion of the diaphragm on the cephalic side is formed from the septum transversum. But the diaphragm is greatly extended on the lateral sides of the heart after the embryo is 20 mm. long by the extension of the pleural cavities around it. It appears from the models that this portion of the diaphragm is also formed directly from the periphery of the septum trans- versum.

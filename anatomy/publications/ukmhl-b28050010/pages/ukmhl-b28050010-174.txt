158 perhaps in a majority of the cases there are other evidences of such adhesions having been present, and, as Schaeffer points out, the caudal region, like other projecting portions of the embryo, is especially liable to stick to the amnion. The adhesions are to be regarded, however, merely as a factor which may induce the persistence of an otherwise transitory structure and it does not follow that such persistence is always the result of adhesions. On the contrary, we find in certain animals that the caudal filament normally persists. Accord- ing to Braun, this is probably the origin of the tail-stump, composed of areolar tissue, found in Inuus pithecus, and simi- lar apendages are also found sometimes in the Chimpansee, as Rosenberg has described. Dr. Hrdlicka stated that in examining seven hundred boys of the 1ST. Y. Juvenile Asylum, he had found one with a little caudal appendage. The growth looked like the tip of the little finger protruding from beneath the skin and pointing downward. It was situated in the median furrow slightly above the end of the coccyx and was soft. Yo movement of the part was observed during the examination, soon after which the child was discharged and lost sight of. O o

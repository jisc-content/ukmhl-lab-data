124 his “Lecture Notes for 1900”; in the second column those obtained by the writer. I.—B. G. WlI.DKR. II.—E. A. Spitzka. Class I 44 per cent. 32 per cent. Class II 33 per cent. 45 per cent. Class III 17 per cent. 17 per cent. Class IV 6 per cent. 6 per cent. Continuity (all cases) 58 per cent. 64 per cent. Separation (all cases) 42 per cent. 36 per cent. Left continuity 77 per cent. 77 per cent. Left separation 23 per cent.* 23 per cent. Right continuity 39 per cent. 51 per cent. Right separation 61 per cent. 49 per cent. Svmmetry 50 per cent. 62 per cent. Asvmmetry 50 per cent. 38 per cent. It will be observed that in general the results are similar. The exceptional cases are an inversion of the percentages of classes I and II, a greater frequency of continuity in all cases (second column) and a greater frequency of symmetrical con- ditions, perhaps due to the average lower grade of the brains at my disposal.

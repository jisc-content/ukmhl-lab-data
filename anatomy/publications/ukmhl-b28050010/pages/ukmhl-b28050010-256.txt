234 tome and the tip of the phrenic nerve. It shows that the attachment of the ductus Cuvieri is no longer broad, as in embryo LXXX, but is narrow, forming a mesentery as de- scribed by His. On the dorsal side of the ductus there is a ridge which begins as the ductus projects into the coelom and gradually runs over into the lobe of the liver. This ridge is very pronounced and is also well shown in the sections of Fig. 23.—Cast of coelom of embryo II x 20 times; P, pericardial coelom; L, coelom encircling to liver. His’s embryos, A and B, as given in his Atlas. The relation of this ridge to the phrenic nerve as well as its form in older embryos makes of it the Anlage of both the pleuro-pericardial and pleuro-peritoneal membranes. It lies in the sagittal plane of the coelom and as it passes the region of the fourth and fifth cervical nerves receives into its substance the phrenic nerve which passes on the caudal side of the ductus Cuvieri.

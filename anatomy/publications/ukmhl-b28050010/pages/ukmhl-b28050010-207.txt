185 ON THE ORIGIN OF THE LYMPHATICS IN THE LIVER. By Franklin P. Mall, Professor of Anatomy, Johns Hopkins University. The origin of the lymphatics of the liver was first definitely determined by MacGillavry,1 who studied this subject under the direction of Ludwig. Long before the work of Mac- Gillavry it had been observed that ligature of the bile duct was followed by passage of bile over into the lymphatics, and the artificial filling of the lymphatics naturally followed by injecting a colored fluid into the bile duct. Sections of liver, in which the lymphatics had been filled with Prussian blue, or with asphalt, showed that the fluid injected into the bile ducts leaves them at the periphery of the lobule to enter spaces surrounding the blood capillaries, the so-called peri- vascular lymph spaces. These spaces communicate at the periphery of the lobule directly with the interlobular lymph channels. Frequently there is an extravasation of the injec- tion mass into the blood capillaries of the lobule. These observations were subsequently confirmed by numer- ous competent investigators, using the method employed by MacGillavry as well as that of direct injection of Prussian blue into the walls of the portal and hepatic veins. In successful injections made in this way it is found that the Prussian blue injected enters the lobule to encircle its blood capillaries.2 Such injections, however, are always accompanied with num- erous extravasations of the injected material into the tissues between the lobules, and often there is a secondary injection 1 MacGillavry, Wiener Sitzungsber., 1864. 2 Budge, Ludwigâ€™s Arbeiten, 1875.,

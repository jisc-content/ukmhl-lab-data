THE INTRINSIC BLOOD-VESSELS OF THE KIDNEY AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN NEPHROTOMY. By Max Brodel. [PRELIMINARY COMMUNICATION.1] In view of the enormous number of investigations of the different structures of the kidney recorded in the literature it seems strange that only scanty information exists on the actual course of the larger blood-vessels and their relation to the pelvis of the kidney. The normal and abnormal arrange- ment of the vessels at the hilum are well known and the microscopical pictures of the vessels in the cortex and pyramids are likewise thoroughly familiar to every student. But as to the actual form of the pelvis and the course and distribution of the larger vessels around its walls very vague ideas still prevail. It is evident that exact knowledge of the anatomy of this region would prove of the utmost im- portance to the surgeon in enabling him to open the pelvis of the kidney without running the risk of cutting large branches of the renal arterv. In order to study this region I made a large number (40) of celloidin injections of human kidneys. The injected 1 Since this article was sent to press, I learned that Dr. William Keiller, of Galveston, Texas, has been following a similar line of research. His findings were embodied in a report to the Texas State Med. Soc., in whose Transactions for 1900 they appear. I have just received through the kindness of Dr. Keiller some of his specimens which substantiate many of the points brought forth in this paper, although the methods he employed differed essentially from mine. This being merely a preliminary communication precludes the possi- bility of discussing in detail Dr. Keillerâ€™s excellent work.

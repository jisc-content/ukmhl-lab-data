236 Soon the lung bud grows against this ridge, causes it to bulge, and with the rotation of the liver towards the head the ridge is divided into two parts; (1) the cephalic end which retains the phrenic nerve and ductus Cuvieri and forms the pleuro- pericardial membrane, and (2) the caudal end which remains attached to the tip of the dorsal end of the septum trans- versum and the liver on the one hand, the body-wall on the other, to form the pleuro-peritoneal membrane. Fig. 26.â€”Sagittal section through, the embryo 6.5 mm. long. No. CXVI x 25 times; pit, pharynx; hr', first branchial arch; ba, bulbus aortte ; a, auricle; v, ventricle; ?, lung; li, liver; pr, pulmonary ridge. Figs. 26-28 show this ridge in sagittal sections in Embryo CXVI, a specimen not quite as large as Xo. II, but somewhat - more advanced in development. In Fig. 26 its cephalic end appears as a broad membrane which in a section nearer the middle line extends to the liver on the ventral side and accompanies the ductus Cuvieri to the body-wall on the dorsal side, Fig. 27, pr. Stil more towards the midline the ridge ends as a decided elevation immediately to the caudal side of the tip of the lung.

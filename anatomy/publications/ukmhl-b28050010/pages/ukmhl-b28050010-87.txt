87 single ease here presented wefe absurd; it simply points in the direction of the following logical chain—partly of obtained facts, partly of natural conclusions from these. In a stud)* made of heredity, whose results were placed at my disposal, covering the parentage and descent of individ- uals prominent in various fields of science, politics, art and handicraft, it is found that the cases where both father and son attained distinction sufficiently to merit place (in the bio- graphical encyclopedias), in intellectual fields of labor, they had been of those in whom skilled motor innervations in their association with sensory impressions and registrations are prerequisites. Preeminently is this the case with two pro- fessions—that of the composer-musician and that of the phil- ologist. As defects in speech are so likely to be repeated in a family line, it seems that its skilled employment by the an- cestor is similarly reflected in the way of facile acquirability on the part of the descendant. Not unrelated may be the fact that among those recruited for the ranks of linguists of other than philologist parentage, there largely predominate those whose parents had emigrated or who were born on islands, in seaport towns or in lands where two dialects are spoken, not to mention those in whose families it has been the custom to maintain an ancient tongue for sacerdotal reasons. The speech faculty in its intimate relations to thought- expression, to memory—in its reading-form to sight, in writ- ing to manual muscular innervation, exquisitely hereditary as it is in life, and most accurately localizable in the ravages of disease, as shown after death, appears one whose transmission is most likely to be expressed by morphological signs—be they relative and quantitative or purely morphological—and these in and about the Island of Reil. I have said that there exists a resemblance between the “physiognomies”—if I may use that term—of these brains. But if the various features of these specimens be separately analyzed and compared this resemblance becomes a striking one. The view that a coincidence of features in the brains of parent and child is due to an actual transmission, as that term is now understood, gains in plausibility in proportion as such features are marked or exceptional, and most so, as in the brains before us, where they approach the atypical. The term atypical as here used is so in a morphological sense only, and not as equivalent to the sense of aberrant

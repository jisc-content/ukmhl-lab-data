97 The cerebellum or epenceplialon had a large hemorrhage over caudal and dorsal surfaces. The pia was much con- gested and the blood vessels seemed thickened. The lingula o O and superior medullary velum were normal. The lobulus centralis was small but normal in shape ; its folia seemed normal. The sulcus post-centralis was well defined. The culmen monticula and its folia were also normal. The clivus was degenerate in form ; its folia were diminutive. The sul- cus preclivalis was well defined. The folium cacuminis was represented by a thin layer of gray matter resting upon a thin stratum of white matter. This layer has become displaced in the specimen here presented. The horizontal sulcus was absent as were tuber valvulae pyramis, uvula and nodulus. Through the open space left by their absence are visible the flocculus, amygdala, lobi biventralis, lunatus anterior and pos- terior, gracilis, postero-inferior and postero-superior.

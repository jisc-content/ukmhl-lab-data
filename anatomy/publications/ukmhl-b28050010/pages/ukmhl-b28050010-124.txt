118 A CONTRIBUTION TO THE FISSURAL INTEGRAL- ITY OF THE PAROCCIPITAL; OBSERVATIONS UPON ONE HUNDRED BRAINS. By Edward A. Spitzka. Student of Medicine, Medical Department, Columbia University. I. Chief among writers upon encephalic anatomy, Turner, Cunningham, Parker and Wilder, stand as exponents of sev- eral hypotheses concerning the status and origin of the paroc- cipital fissure. Turner1 and Cunningham2 consider it the pars occipitalis of an intraparietal complex composed of four fac- tors. Wilder3 considers it a zygal fissural integer, his main point being its greatest depth at its middle, with no evidence of a transverse occipital at its caudal end more than at its cephalic, and with no approach to the parietal. Of more recent date is the work of Parker4. This author, taking into consideration the development of new conditions and pressure forces as cerebral growth continues, in a skull which assumes a more fixed and rigid shape, concludes that it is not a fissural integ'er at all, but merely a modification produced in the manner of connection of the originally confluent intraparietal and fissura perpendicularis externa, and that, for reasons pointed out by him, this so-called paroccipital is deepest at its middle point and gradually becomes shallower as it joins the intraparietal and backwardlv displaced fissura perpendicularis externa. The scope of this article does not permit me to go far into the details of Parker’s argument, but I shall endeavor to give a brief account of his idea of the development of the fissure since it serves as the main basis for the present discussion.

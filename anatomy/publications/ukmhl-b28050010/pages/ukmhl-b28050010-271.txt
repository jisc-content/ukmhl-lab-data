249 the liver is in the abdominal cavity. The septum transversum with its extension, the pleuro-peritoneal membrane, stretches across the body from the tips of the embryonic ribs. But in the thorax lie the lungs, and their further growth into the lateral walls of the embryo and septum transversum will make them encircle the heart, thereby enlarging the pleuro- pericardial membranes and changing position of the phrenic nerves. Fig. 44.â€”Sagittal section through the body of the embryo 16 mm. long. No. XLIII x 10 times; ,9, ninth rib. After the heart, lungs, liver and stomach are located in their permanent positions the pleuro-peritoneal membrane grows rapidly and soon closes the opening between the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Fig. 4-2 is from a section lateral to the opening showing the phrenic nerve throughout its great- est extent. In this specimen the marked growth is in the pleural cavity. Fig. 43 is from a section through the opening- on a larger scale, including also the adrenal. A stage slightly more advanced is shown in Fig. 44. In this speci- men, as in the one above, both pleural cavities communicate

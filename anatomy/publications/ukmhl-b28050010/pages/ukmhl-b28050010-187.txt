171 A NEW CARBON-DIOXIDE FREEZING MICROTOME. By Charles Russell Bardeen, M. D., Associate in Anatomy, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. The carbon-dioxide freezing microtomes in common nse O in pathological laboratories have several drawbacks. Of these the most serious are those clue to the use of a rubber tube to connect the tank with the freezing stage. In addition to the annoyances due to the rubber tube the microtomes are so constructed as to utilize but a slight fraction of the heat absorption due to the expansion of the liquid carbon-dioxide. In order to obviate these drawbacks the microtome described below was devised. In the designing of the original machine I had the assistance of Mr. E. F. Northrup. In the construc- tion of the present machine I am indebted to Bausch and Lomb, who manufacture it, for several modifications which have simplified the instrument and rendered it more useful. Figure 1 shows the machine as it stands ready for use. It is made to screw directly upon the nozzle of the carbon- dioxide tank. The valve of the latter is utilized to control the escape of the gas into the freezing stage. When the microtome is screwed directly upon the carbon-dioxide tank it is necessary that the tank should lie in a horizontal posi- tion, on a table for instance, where it may be held in place by some simple clamp. On the other hand, if it is desired to connect the microtome to a tank placed in some other than the horizontal position an L-shaped piece of tubing may be screwed on the nozzle of the tank and the microtome on the other end of the L tube. The tank may then be placed in any position desired. The axis and main support of the machine consists of a solid tube with a narrow lumen (K-D, Fig. 2). This axial

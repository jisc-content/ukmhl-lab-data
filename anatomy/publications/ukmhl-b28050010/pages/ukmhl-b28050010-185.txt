1G9 ical relations of the two centres are certainly intimate and direct. The feature of special interest in this group of experiments is the large number of degenerate fibres passing from the area of the cortical lesion over the middle line in the corpus callosum and down the internal capsule of the opposite side. With the exception of those fibres going to the superior tem- poral convolution of the opposite side, these fibres, in this experiment, all pass into the thalamus. In a few animals, in which practically the same area was extirpated, some of the degenerated fibres found in the internal capsule of the opposite side can be followed through the pons and medulla into the cervical region of the cord where they disappear. Nerve fibres within the central nervous system usually functionate in the direction of degeneration, but there is nothing in the character of the degeneration to suggest the character of the function. This can only be guessed at by the origin, course and termination of the fibres and what we know of the function of the areas and structures thus anatomically associated. Some of the projection fibres pass- ing inward from the motor cortex clearly carry motor im- pulses, but it cannot be assumed that all do. A vast number of projection fibres arising in the motor cortex end in the 1 The writer has found the same thingâ€”degeneration in the internal capsule of both sides after unilateral lesion in the brain, in the dog. In the dog all the degeneration in the internal capsule of the opposite side ends in the thalamus.

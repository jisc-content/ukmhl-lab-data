1G5 region of the cord. It is quite possible that complicated movements may be brought about in either or both ways. The great increase in cortical association tracts between mon- key and man suggests the possibility of inconceivable degrees of association. Looking upon the motor cortex as representing the centres for associated movements one would naturally expect to find projection fibres passing directly down through the capsule from that part of the cortex, giving rise to the movement. As I understand the significance of excitation experiments upon the cortex, the finding of a centre for the uncompli- cated movement of the thumb only means that in the move- ment represented at that spot, the movement of the thumb (flexion or otherwise) is the first or initial movement of the march. If the stimulation is continued or increased the march is continued or completed unless interrupted by a general convulsion. Thus, if the anaesthesia is at just the right stage the gentlest stimulus only excites the first or initiatory movement of the march. In opposition to such a theory it may be urged that only one centre has been found in any single animal for such uncomplicated or initial move- ment, while many combinations are possible beginning with such movement. This would hardly render an entirely sepa- rate centre for each movement necessary, as they might all be grouped about the common centre.

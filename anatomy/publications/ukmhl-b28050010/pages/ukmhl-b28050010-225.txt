203 USE OF THE MATERIAL OF THE DISSECTING ROOM FOR SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES. By Charles Russell Bardeen, M. D., Associate in Anatomy, Johns Hopkins University. Rosenberg, in a recent article,1 has called attention to the opportunities that the dissecting room offers for scientific investigation. He gives an interesting summary of the vari- ous attempts that have been made to take advantage of these opportunities, and calls particular attention to the records ob- tained by Schwalbe at Strassbnrg, by Cunningham at Dublin, and by the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland. It has seemed to me that the methods employed to utilize the material of the dissecting room and the work of the students for scientific purposes in Professor Mali’s laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, may prove of interest, possibly of value, to those engaged elsewhere in anatomical instruction. The immense amount of study that has been given to the structure of the human body during the last four centuries renders it unlikely that the student’s untrained eye and hand could be utilized to advantage in a search for unrecorded facts of gross structure even if time permitted him to delve in those little nooks and corners where the records are still incomplete. The very considerable amount of variation, however, which the individual bodies present in the structure, form and relationships of their various organs, offers a rich field for cultivation. Since the time of Darwin much attention has been given to the study of variations in plants and animals. The greater * Morphologisches Jahrbuch, 1895.

68 Less marked differences in the shape, strength and length of the ribs of the two sides are common in both undeformed and deformed thoraces. ARTICULATIONS BETWEEN RIBS. Occasionally, after a fracture of a rib, there is a develop- ment, from the callus, of a bony process which reaches to the adjoining rib, or meets a similar process sent from this, and the process and the rib or the two processes form an articulation. In one instance, in the skeleton mentioned in the preced- ing paragraph, there are well developed articulations between four ribs on each side (8th to nth) without there having been any fracture. The articular facets are slightly" elevated ; they are situated near the angle of the ribs, and have undoubtedly resulted from a close apposition and at least an occasional contact of the dorsal thirds of the bones. FRACTURES OF THE RIBS. Among the whites, fractures were found in four per thousand (i in 125 skeletons) in the first rib; twenty per thousand (1 in 25 skeletons) in the second rib; and fifty per thousand (1 in each, or 3 in every third skeleton) in the ribs below the second. In Indians, fractures of ribs are very much more rare * (and the same seems to be the condition in the negro, but there were not enough negro ribs to permit a definite statement). The fractures were : Single in 77-4°/o (riglit, 39.4, left, 38.0 °/o)- Double in 19.0 u (right, 9.4, left, 9.6 “ ). Triple in 3.2 “ (right, 1.6, left, 1.6 “ ). Quadruple in 0.3 “ (right, 0.15, left, 0.15 “ ). The situation of the single fractures was as follows: In the head, right, °-3 ° / / 0 left, - % Between head and angle, right, 2.9 u left, 2.1 ‘ At the angle, right, 8.4 u left, 9.0 ‘ At or in the posterior ) third of body j right, 21.0 U left, 18.8 1 At or near middle, right, 17-5 u left, 26.0 ‘ At or near anterior third, right, 2i-5 u left, 23.0 ‘ Near the sternal end, right, 6.1 u left, 3-5 ‘ Curvatures and pathological conditions of the ribs will be described later. * Among 1480 ribs of the ancient cliff dwellers in Southern Utah, only four, or 2.7 per thousand were fractured.

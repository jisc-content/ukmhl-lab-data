188 holds hack the granules, as is the case with the blood when normal circulation is taking place. If the portal vein is injected with Prussian-blue gelatin under a low pressure, it is found that in a few minutes the lymphatics are all filled with the blue mass. Livers injected in this way are best hardened in formalin and then cut by the freezing method, for alcohol causes the gelatin to shrink. Fig. 1.—Section through the periphery of the liver lobule of a cat. The hepatic artery was injected with cinnabar gelatin, and the portal vein with Prussian-blue gelatin, stained with Van Gieson’s stain, x 500 Z, lobule of liver; c, capillaries; a, artery; l, lymph vessel; pci, times, perivascular lymph space ; pll, perilobular lymph space ; u\ bundles of fibrils of white fibrous tissue. Such sections show that the blue fluid has entered the lym- phatics at the' periphery of the lobule. More instructive are the specimens when the injection is stopped just as the first lymphatics are filled with the colored gelatin. By following the larger lymphatics back into the liver substance it is found that the interlobular connective tissue is entirely filled with blue where the lymphatics are injected, but only partly col- ored blue when they are not. In other words, the blue extra-

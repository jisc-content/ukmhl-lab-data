50 THE USE OF WET SPECIMENS. By Dr. Edmund W. Holmes, Philadelphia. The purpose of this paper is not ultra scientific, but argu- mentative and evangelistic, because (i) among the general public and among many of our profession the great cry is practicability, z. <?., the doctor must be able to use that which he knows, and, knowing it, must be able quickly to transform it into gold ; because (2) our medical schools are advocating the scientific idea—science and knowledge for its own sake— and, strangely enough, in the sectarianism of the laboratory are endeavoring to train their pupils to be scientific before they have been educated as physicians. We most thoroughly endorse the sentiments of Prof. Dwight, expressed at the last annual meeting in New Haven, in opposition to excessive student experimentation. As a resultant of these two forces, our medical schools are getting away from their original intent of turning out prac- ticing physicians, but in their stead are evolving one-sided specialists, which the tendency to laboratory and section teach- ing only seems to increase, by compelling men to choose a certain subject or two, which shall, perforce, occupy the greater part of their attention, to the disadvantage of the rest. A good plan badly carried out is fatal to its efficiency, and laboratory or section work which (needlessly) tends to a narrow specialism in the undergraduate years, backed up by popular clamor for immature specialists and an undue desire for quick financial returns, is really worse than the old system of seven fundamental branches, of intelligent breadth of in- struction, in all of which the graduate must be reasonably proficient. From this attitude of utilitarianism and specialty has arisen a disregard of the fundamental branches and an impatience of the toil necessary for their acquirement, particularly in regard to human anatomy, which is ill concealed even by some in authority.

245 in Figs. 31 to 34. They show again that the pulmonary ridge reaches from the ductus Cuvieri to the tip of the lung, and the phrenic nerve. It is readily seen from Figs. 30 and 32 how the phrenic nerve is pushed to its permanent position by the further rotation and recession of the septum trans- versum and liver, and the lateral growth of the lungs to encircle the heart. Fig. 39.â€” Section through the body of the embryo 11 mm. long. No. CIX x 10 times; ph, phrenic nerve; pc, pleuro-pericardial membrane; st, septum transversum; h, humerus; 3, first rib; 2, second rib; 1, third rib. Figs. 35 and 36 are from sagittal sections of Embryo CXIII, which is of the same stage as CLXIII. The phrenic nerve is shown throughout its whole course from the fifth cervical nerve to the pleuro-pericardial membrane. The nerve re- ceives a second branch a few sections deeper from the sixth cervical which unites with the main trunk before it enters the pleuro-pericardial membrane. Hanging from the pleuro- pericardial membrane is a section of the pleuro-peritoneal, which in Fig. 36 unites with the dorsal wall of the cadorn at the head end of the Wolffian body.

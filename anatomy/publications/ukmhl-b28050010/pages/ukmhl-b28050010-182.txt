166 In experimental destruction of small cortical areas in the monkey I have often traced projection fibres into the cervical region of the cord from portions of the facial area far re- moved from arm centres. Such fibres probably represent the conduction paths for impulses, giving rise to movements in which the arm is associated with facial movement. Such movements or actions are numerous in the monkey and in- crease as we go up in the scale. For example, in feeding, the monkey stretches out his arm, opens the hand to lay hold of the object, which he grasps and carries toward his already opening mouth. In this instance the extension of the arm is the initial movement, followed by extension of the thumb Fig. 4. and fingers, then flexion, etc. Such a movement or march is of course much more complicated than any movement obtained by electrical stimulation of the cortex. But it must he assumed that the normal discharge of energy from the cells concerned in the cortical reflex, as a result of incoming sensa- tions, is a very different affair from our experimental stimu- lation. Stimulation of the motor cortex with a weak faradie current gives rise to certain movements. Cut away the cor- tical cells and stimulate the cut ends of the projection fibres immediately beneath and you get the same result. Who can say these results are or are not brought about in the same way? Does the former experiment induce a discharge of energy from the cell or does the current passing through the

However this may be we cannot safely assume that stimula- tion experiments disclose more than a hint of the functional activity of the cortex. A study of the excitation experiments of Beevor and Hors- ley 5 on the bonnet monkey shows that they obtained from the cortical area corresponding to the lesion in this experi- ment : Movements of thumb of the opposite side; flexion, exten- sion and adduction; * Flexion and extension of the fingers, opposite side; Movements of wrist, elbow and shoulder, opposite side; Closure of opposite eyelids; Turning of the head to the opposite side; Retraction and elevation of the corner of the mouth, oppo- site side; Pouting, pursing and rolling in of the lips, more of the opposite side, but often bilateral; Opening of both eyes and Retraction of the head.

193 BORN'S METHOD OF RECONSTRUCTION BY MEANS OF WAX PLATES AS USED IN THE ANATOMI- CAL LABORATORY OF THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY. By Charles Russell Bardeen, Associate in Anatomy, Johns Hopkins University. The wax-plate method of reconstruction (Plattenmodellen methode) described by Born in 1876 1 has proved of great value in the study of the morphology of embryos. The method has received its most extensive application in the hands of Born, of His and of various pupils of these investi- gators. In general, however, it may be said, that the value of this method as an aid to the microscopic study of form has not been sufficiently appreciated. In part this lack of a more general application of the method has been due to certain technical difficulties which tend to make it cumbersome and time-consuming. Yet by no other method can so accurate an idea be obtained of the form of those structures which from their minuteness or complexity of relation cannot well be dissected out. Considerable application of the method has recently been made by different persons in this institution and each worker has contributed something towards making the method more effective. As originally described by Born several steps are essential for the successful application of his method. These may be tabulated as follows: 1 Morph. Jahrb. II; Arch. f. mikr. Anat., xxii, p. 584.

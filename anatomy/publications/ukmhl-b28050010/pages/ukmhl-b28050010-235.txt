213 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN DIAPHRAGM.1 By Franklin P. Mall, Professor of Anatomy, Johns Ilopkins University. In a paper on the development of the human coelom, pub- lished several years ago, I was not able to give a detailed description of the separation of the body cavities from one another, because the specimens at my disposal did not include all the necessary stages. For that study I used 19 human embryos between 2 and 24 mm. long, in which various stages of the development of the body-cavities were shown, hut a number of the important stages were missing. During the past three years the collection of human em- bryos in the anatomical laboratory has grown very rapidly and all the missing stages for the study of the formation of the body-cavities have been supplied. The following table gives a list of these embryos. It will be seen from it that the series from 2 mm. upward is very complete with the ex- ception of stages between 11 and 14 mm. long. Fortunately, the missing stages are not important. All the embryos given in this table are practically perfect, the imperfect ones having been excluded. The present study is based upon 15 embryos, only 3 of which are included in the 19 specimens considered in the earlier communication. It has often been stated that the development of the diaphragm, especially in the human embryo, is one of the most difficult problems of embryology, party because of the difficulty in obtaining the necessary specimens and 1 Mall, Jour, of Morph., vol. 12, 1897.

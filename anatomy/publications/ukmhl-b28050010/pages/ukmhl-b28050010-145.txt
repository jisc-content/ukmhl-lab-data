139 THE LOBULE OF THE LUNG. By Dr. W. S. Miller, Madison, Wis. [Abstract.] The term lobule as applied to the unit of the lung has been used in an exceedingly vague sense both by anatomists and pathologists. It is the purpose of the paper to give a definite meaning to the term. THE EPITHELIUM OF THE PLEURAL CAVITIES. By Dr. Miller, Madison, Wis. [Abstract.] Since the time of v. Recklinghausen and Oedmansson cer- tain dark spots seen in many preparations of serous mem- branes Stained by the silver-nitrate method have been called stomata and stigmata. Ludwig and Dybkowsky described such structures in the pleura. Muscatello has recently shown that such openings do not exist normally in the peritoneum. It is the purpose of the paper to show that they do not exist in the pleura when studied in the normal condition, and that they can be produced artificially at the pleasure of the inves- tigator. APPARATUS FOR DEMONSTRATING THE CIRCU- LATION OF THE BLOOD. By B. B. Stroud, B. S., D. Sc., Cornell University. The apparatus is an imitation of the actual blood vascular system. The heart, arteries, capillaries and veins are repre- sented by a rubber bulb with valves, very elastic rubber tubing, capillary glass tubing and thinner rubber tubing. The bifur- cation of arteries is shown in Y-shaped, of veins by LT-shaped glass tubes. The circulation is continuous, as in the living body. Manometer tubes indicate the difference in pressure in arteries and veins.

preparations to show embryonic type of mammalian heart before septal division, ducts of Cuvier and symmetrical card- inal veins. 2. Heart of Python molurus—hardened and distended, with sections showing : (a) sinus venosus of right auricle ; (b) valves of sinus venosus and their relation to the Eustachian and Thebesian valves of the mammalian heart; (c) pulmonary veins ; (d) persistent left preeava. 3. Heart of Struthio africanus—injected, showing persist- ent avian left preeava—with its relations to pericardium and coronary vein. 4. Ruminant heart (.Antelope cervicaprct) — mammalian type of normal persistence of left preeava. 5. Series of normal human hearts—showing, in various preparations, coronary sinus, Thebesian and Eustachian valves—both foetal and adult. 6. Series of well-developed folds of Marshal in foetal and adult hearts. 7. As soon as obtained, the final member of this group will be added as a preparation showing the normal persistence of the left preeava in the adult human subject. Instances in which a similar limited and selected group of preparations may be with advantage established for the eluci- dation of special details in human anatomy could be almost indefinitely multiplied. I have noted at random : 1. Development of axis and atlas. 2. Ligaments and tendons of shoulder joint. 3. Greater and lesser sciatic ligaments and relation to hamstring muscles and coecygeus. 4. Postcava and variations. 5. Carpus and tarsus. 6. Sacrum and vertebral variations. 7. Aortic arch and variations of primary branches. 8. Various myological problems. 9. The peritoneum. The question as to the practical application of this educa- tional material to the requirements of undergraduate instruc- tion in anatomy deserves careful consideration from several points of view : 1. Primarily the museum should afford a consecutive and logical serial exhibition, arranged and administered in such a

It forms a portion of the ventral wall of the pericardial coelom and supports the omphalo- mesenteric and umbilical veins. Sections of it are shown in Fig. 2.—Partial dissection of the reconstruction of tlie embryo 2.1 mm. long.

Figs. 3, 4 and 5, which are from three sections through the head end of this embryo in the neighborhood of the first cervical myotome. The Anlage of the liver is shown in Fig. 4, which is located in this stage in a region belonging to the head. Figs. 6 to 9 are from an embryo (CLX1Y) slightly more

It is seen that the coelom sends two canals into the head on either side of the neck which communicate with each other in the immediate neighborhood of the mouth. This U-shaped canal is separated from the exocoelom on its ventral side by a bridge of mesodermal tissue connecting the umbili- cal vesicle with the embryo at the juncture of the head with

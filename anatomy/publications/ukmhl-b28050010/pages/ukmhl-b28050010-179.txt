163 represent the comparative amount of degeneration so accur- ately in the outline drawings of transverse sections of the brain (Figs. 3 to 7 inclusive), because in so small a figure, in order to have the degeneration show at all, it was necessary to exaggerate. Degenerated fibres can be seen crossing in the corpus callosum in all the segments except “ E,” the most posterior. The distribution of association fibres to the convolutions of the two hemispheres is very nearly equal and quite symmetrical. It extends also upon the internal (mesial) surface of both hemispheres as far as the calloso-marginal fissure. In two segments, C and D, the degeneration extends to the superior temporal convolution of both sides. The route taken by the degenerated fibres to reach the temporal lobe is the same in both hemispheres and is interesting. In sec- tion “ B ” (Fig. 4) a few degenerated fibres appear among the fibres passing to the superior temporal convolution just ex- ternal to the thickened lower edge of the claustrum on both sides. In the segment posterior to this (Fig. 5) many degen- erated fibres can be seen leaving the internal capsule, break- ing through the thin inferior edge of the lenticular nucleus and passing below the claustrum to reach the superior tem- poral convolution. Some of these fibres probably terminate in the lateral geniculate body. Although no continuous

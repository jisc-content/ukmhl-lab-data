137 OUTLINE NO. 2 2. CONDUCTION PATHS. Reconstruction. Directions : With the aid of the drawings already made, together with the lecture notes and descriptive texts, construct diagrams illustrating the following conduction paths and the neurone systems of which these paths are composed : VI. Thk Cerebro-Ponto-Cerebellar Paths. A. Cercbio-cor/ico-ponlal paths: 1. Fasciculus palliopontilis {pars frontalis), (feet of gyri frontales, corona radiata, capsula interna [pars frontalis'], basispedunculi, fascicluli longitudinales pontis, nuclei pontis). 2. Fasciculus palliopontilis { pars occipitotemporalis'), {lobus occipitalis and lobus temporalis, capsula interna, basis pedunculi, fasciculi longitudinalis pontis, nuclei pontis). B. Ponto-cerebellar path: {Nucleipontis, brachia pontis, cortex cerebelli). VII. The Commissural Paths. 1. Corpus callosum. 2. Commissura anterior cerebri. 3. Commissura hippocampi {Psalterium). VIII. The Association Paths. A. Long paths: 1. Cingulum {in gyrus fornicatus). 2. Fasciculus longitudinalis superior {lobus frontalis and lobus oc- cipitalis) . B. Short paths : 3. Fasciculus uncinatus {uncus and lobus frontalis). 4. Fornix {hippocampus and substantia perforata anterior). 5. Tapetum {lobus frontalis and lobus occipitalis). The following additional outlines have been made out, and will be given in the course next year, the required material being prepared by a technical assistant: sophomore neurology. OUTLINE NO. 16'. ENCEPHALON OF MAN. Directions : Supplement the study of the fresh sections of the pons and the medulla oblongata by a study of corresponding sections of hardened tissue prepared according to the methods of Marchi and Weigert. sophomore neurology, outline no. i8L THE NEURONE AS A UNIT. Directions : Study the individual neurones in microscopic specimens prepared according to the methods of Golgi and Nissl. Draw individual neurones as seen in the cerebrum, the cerebellum, the medulla spinalis and the ganglia spina!es.

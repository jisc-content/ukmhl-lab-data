112 between the muscularity of the individual and the degree and kind of fissuration of the paracentral gyrus. The importance of determining with accuracy the ana- tomical relations of this region is based largely upon the fact that the cortical distribution of the motor neurones presiding over the movements of the lower limb is essentially confined, on the meson at least, to the paracentral gyrus as Betz, Schwalbe, Broca appear to have understood it. (See the ex- cellent figure in L. F. Barker’s “ Nervous System”, Plate i14.) As indicated above, the dorsal relations of the inflected were also considered in the first series. In the great majority of cases (eighty per cent.) the inflected was situated cephalad of the supercentral. (See Table II.) In thirteen per cent, it was observed to indent a well-defined inflected gyre (Wilder) embraced by the dorsal radii of a bifur- cated supercentral. This condition was symmetrical in three brains, and occurred oftener on the right half. In only six per cent, was the inflected caudad of the supercentral, i. e., between the latter and the central fissure. In a few instances (number not noted) there was a superficial confluence with the supercentral, but a shallow vadum was always demonstrable. Table II.—First Series of Fifty Brains.

Broca15, Mickle16, and others consider oval lobule to be less objectionable than paracentral

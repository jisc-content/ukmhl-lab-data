244 body and at right angles to the plane of the septum trans- versum. Judging hy the relation of the phrenic nerve to the pulmonary ridge the portion of it on the dorsal side of the ductus Cuvieri containing the phrenic nerve, the portion con- taining the ductus Cuvieri, and the secondary ridge of the ventral side of the ductus Cuvieri, form the pleuro-pericardial membrane. The portion of the pulmonary ridge on the caudal side of the phrenic nerve gives rise to the pleuro- peritoneal membrane. In so doing it gradually shifts over Fig. 38.â€”Lateral view of the embryo 11 mm. long, showing the pleuro-pericardial and pleuro-peritoneal membranes.

The growth of the pleuro-pericardial membrane towards the head and the pleuro-peritoneal towards the tail widens the dorsal projection of the septum transversum and into this wide base the lung burrows throwing the pleuro-peri- cardial membrane with the phrenic nerve to its medial side. The fate of the pulmonary ridge is shown in Fig. 30, which is from Embryo CLXIII. Sections of this embryo are shown

it is surprising how much students can be taught with the simple material prepared and presented in the way mentioned, a,nd the results of the course have been so encouraging that the writers feel justified in recommending the adoption of similar methods in places where, owing to lack of time, laboratory facilities, material and a sufficient instructional force, more ideal courses in neurology cannot be given. A course of the nature outlined above is feasible in any medical school* NOTE FROM CHARLES H. WARD. Rochester, N. Y., December 23, 1900. I desire to inform you of the following facts concerning my paper on the Cranio-Mandibular Index, read at the Ithaca meeting December, 1897. The ratio between cranium and mandible suggested itself to me as of interest several years ago. Doctor J. Edward Line, of this city, then Editor of the Odontographic Journal, well posted 011 odontological matters, assured me, on inquiry, that, so far as he knew, no such com- parison had been published. The results of many hundreds of weighings were collected in my paper. The term Cranio-Mandibular naturally sug- gested itself as a good name for the proposed index. But on February 11, 1900, while glancing over a copy of the American Anthropologist of July 1891, a copy, by the way, whose leaves I cut as I read, I found on page 221 in an article by Doctor Robert Fletcher on “ The New School of Criminal Anthro- pology,” Orchanski had attempted to make a table showing the relation of the weight of the jaw to the cranium, or, as he terms it, the cranio-mandibular index.

117 freezing mixture is composed of ice and salt. The method I adopt for suspending the subject is as follows : An iron frame is made, rectangular in form and sufficiently long and broad to allow the subject to lie within it. My frame is 6 feet 6 inches long and 2 feet broad, and is supported at each end on iron supports 2 feet high. The frame must be strong enough to support the weight of the subject. A number of knobs are fastened to this iron frame. These knobs are separated 4 inches from one another all around the frame. A piece of ordinary factory cotton is used to suspend the subject, and this is readily tied to the knobs by strong twine. The value of this method is that one can readily obtain any de- gree of flexion of the head or of the spine or lower extrem- ities by simply drawing upon the factory cotton and securing it to the knobs with the requisite amount of sagging in any one place to obtain the degree of flexion desired. The sub- ject must remain in the box for about three days, when it ought to be frozen completely through and through. You then remove the subject from the box and cut it in the direc- tion desired with an ordinary carpenter’s saw. The sections should in no case be more than three-fourths of an inch in thickness. The section surface is cleaned off by pouring boiling water over it; thus all sawdust is removed, and it is then immediately immersed in alcohol of about 90 per cent. The sections should be left undisturbed in the dirty alcohol (for it becomes very “ dirty”) for a period of about two months at least, after which time they are taken out and thoroughly cleaned. They may subsequently be mounted in alcohol. /

69 PRELIMINARY REPORT WITH PROJECTION DRAW- INGS, ILLUSTRATING THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PARACCELES IN THEIR RELATION TO THE SURFACE OF THE CEREBRUM AND CRANIUM. By Edward A. Spitzka, New York City. (Illustrated by drawings.) [Published in the New York Medical Journal, Vol. LXXIII, February 2, 1901.] [Abstract.] The operations of tapping, draining and injecting the para- coeles, as the lateral ventricles are to be designated, have become recognized surgical procedures, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The mode of procedure, however, is yet far from technical completeness, and consequently these operations are not frequently resorted to, owing to the surgical risks and topographical uncertainties. The writer believed that reference plates giving reliable and clear repre- sentations of the cerebral and cranial relations of the paracoeles were a desideratum. The otherwise excellent plates of Fraser, like most photographic plates, especially if composite, lack the clearness so essential for busy, practical men. A search of the literature made by the writer reveals three attempts essaying to depict such topography : by Poirier, in PArance, Wilson, in England, and Quain (source unknown). They are all unavailable for surgical use. The results here offered are of a preliminary nature only, and so far are based upon the dissections of two heads of adults, for which material I am indebted to Prof. Huntington and Dr. B. B. Gallaudet, of the Medical Department of Colum- bia University. For the illustrations the reader is referred to the fuller account published in the N. Y. Med. Journal, as cited above.

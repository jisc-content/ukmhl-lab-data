PLATE XXX. Fig. 4.—Arrangement of the arteries at the upper and lower pole. They come as siugle trunks from the main artery and run at an angle of 45° or more upward and downward to the vicinity of the major calices, where they divide into three branches. I. Anterior branch. II. Median branch. III. Posterior branch. The anterior and posterior branches are as a rule much larger than the median.

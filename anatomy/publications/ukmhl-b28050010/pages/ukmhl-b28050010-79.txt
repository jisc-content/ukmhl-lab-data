79 These figures indicate in a measure the better development of the left frontal and parietal lobes. The frontal gyres are the most complex of the entire brain, being particularly rich in their windings, though the parietal gyres are almost as rich in their development. The sub- frontal gyrus (Broca’s convolution) of the left half is very well developed, as might be expected, in a right-handed individual with a left speech center. (See Fig. i.) Upon the left half the u intraparietal hssural complex” is remarkable in that all four of the so-called segments are dis- tinctly separated from each other, a condition rarely observed and found by Cunningham3 in only four hemicerebruins out of sixty-two ; once on the left, once on the right, and once on both halves. Mickle4 regards such bridging of the so-called Fig. 2.

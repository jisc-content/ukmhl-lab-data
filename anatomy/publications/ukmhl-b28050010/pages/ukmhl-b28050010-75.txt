75 According to Marshall’s tables the average brain-weight for a man of the height of 65 inches or under, and between the ages of 40 and 70, is 45.74 ounces (= 1,296 grams). It must not be forgotten, however, that the brain-weights of the French are somewhat less than those of the English which Marshall’s figures represent; and if we remember that Dr. Edouard Seguin was about 64 inches in height and was in poor health for some time prior to his decease, his brain-weight of 1,257 grams cannot be said to deviate much from the normal figures, and, if anything, would point to the occurrence of some wast- ing of the brain-tissue from disease, or age, or both. Various estimates of Dr. Seguin’s body-weight range between 125 and 145 pounds, giving ratios, as compared with the brain-weight, ranging between 1 : 45 and 1 : 52. The latter ratio was also found in the case of George Grote by Marshall, and was prob- ably due to the same or similar causes. BRAIN WEIGHTS OF EMINENT MEN.

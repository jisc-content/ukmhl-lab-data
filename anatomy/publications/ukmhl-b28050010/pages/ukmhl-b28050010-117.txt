Ill being* upon the left half. In nine other eases the inflected traversed the whole gyrus, effecting a conjunction with the paracentral stem ; in all, eleven cases of junction, or seven per cent. In the comparison of these percentages with Eber- stallerâ€™s figures, the question of racial peculiarity must be ex- cluded, since the brains which were examined by me were derived from representatives of many different races, white and colored, male and female, and varying in ages from twenty to seventy. In the large majority of the hemicerebrums examined, the inflected fissure ended upon the meson as well as upon the dorsum in a simple manner. In about sixteen per cent, it was observed that the mesial end joined some one of the intra- paracentral fissural elements, giving the inflected a kind of bifurcated appearance. These intraparacentral elements are of not a little importance. There appear to be at least five or six fairly definite types, and nearly every lobule is marked by one or several of these. The longitudinal one, first described by Betz13, and which is commonly bifurcated at one or the other end, is the furrow which is most common, and is most often joined by the inflected. It were interesting to determine what relation exists, if any,

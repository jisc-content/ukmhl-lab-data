PLATE XXVIII. Fig. 3.â€” Left kidney with typical form of a divided pelvis. The two divisions of the pelvis are separated by an area of corticle substance (a) extending almost to the hilum. As a rule the upper division is narrow and has fewer calices than the lower. The division between the two branches of the pelvis is generally marked on the surface of the kidney by a deep depression.

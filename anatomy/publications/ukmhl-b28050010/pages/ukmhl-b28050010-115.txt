109 this view I carried on the researches which form the basis of this paper, in the anatomical laboratory of the Medical Depart- ment of Columbia University. I am indebted to Professor George S. Huntington and Dr. B. B. Gallandet for their cour- teous permission to examine one hundred brains of dissecting- room subjects. The brains had been hardened in formalin and were in a good stage of preservation. Among the various fissnral schemas with which I am ac- quainted, Professor Wilder’s12 is the only one which places the inflected cephalad of the cephalic paracentral limb. Wilder’s figure was based upon the brain of a mulatto described by him in the Handbook article, and in the New York Afediccil Jour- nal, P'ebruary 23, 1884. That this extraparaeentral position of the inflected is an anomalous and rare one will be seen in the latter part of this paper. The brains were divided into two series of fifty each. Series I consisted in a tabulation of both the dorsal and mesial relations of the inflected, while Series II was recorded by means of drawings taken ad naturam, as being better adapted for future study as well as being of great aid in the proposed schematization of the fissures of this region. Table I expresses the mesial relations of both series. Table II shows the dorsal relations of the fissure in the first series. Its absence was symmetrical (l e., on both halves) in 6 brains, or three per cent., while it occurred 22 times on the left, and 18 times on the right half. Table I. I Series. II Series. Totals.

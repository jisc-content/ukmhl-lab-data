54 what to find and where, “in the wet,” and then careful, neat, systematized dissection cannot be done too often. For the preservation of the wet specimens the cold storage is by far the best. Alcohol hardens them ; a solution of chloral waterlogs them ; formalin preparations favor mold as soon as the fluid is allowed to evaporate. Even the Kaiserling fluid permits of this if the specimen is not kept thoroughly im- mersed. But, outside of permanent jar preparations, those which are to be handled had better be kept in storage and can be thus used from year to year. In the coming by and by, when the importance of the dissecting room is recognized, there will be a cold storage plant for this purpose adjacent to it. More and more, in the old museum, its musty jars will be relegated to desuetude, and specimens to be handled by the student will be abundant and within reach. Human anatomy is the most difficult branch in the curri- culum ; the student entering without biologic training, and, perhaps, with it, is but a kindergartener, and should be taught at first as in the kindergarten, by models and specimens, tak- ing apart and putting together, till he learns whereof he knows, and then he should dissect.

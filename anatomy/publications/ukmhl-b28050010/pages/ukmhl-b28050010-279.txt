PLATE XXIX. Fig. 3.â€”The renal artery and the distribution of its branches in relation to the pelvis. A. Anterior view of a left kidney. There are (5 main branches seen entering the kidney substance. Only one of these (the third) passes posterior to the pelvis at the hilum, also small arteries coming from the upper and lower main branches are seen to pass posterior to the upper and lower calices. All the rest of the arteries pass an- terior to the pelvis and its calices. The small branches to the cortex of the anterior portion of the kidney have not been drawn in order that the large branches and the pelvis might appear more distinctly. B. Transverse section through the middle of the same kidney seen from above. The anterior branch of the artery supplies about % of the kidney substance while the posterior branch supplies only The dotted line and arrow indicate the plane of arterial division.

175 the freezing stage on each side for the support of the cutting blade. The base of the knife-stage is moved up the axial tube by screwing the wheel upwards. It is forced down the axial tube by the spring (E, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) whenever the wheel is turned so as to be carried downwards. The flanges of the knife-stage support parallel glass tracks upon which the cutting blade is carried to and fro. For cutting sections a razor or a plane or almost any good steel blade with a straight edge may be used. The advantages of the machine are as follows: 1. But little carbon-dioxide is wasted. 2. The temperature of the freezing stage can be controlled. 3. Owing to the nature of its attachment to the tank it can be readily carried about. This should render it of especial value to surgeons. 4. Above all it is simple in design, strong, and unlikely to get out of order.

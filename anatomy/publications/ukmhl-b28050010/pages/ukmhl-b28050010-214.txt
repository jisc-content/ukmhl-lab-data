192 liver. Furthermore, the fluid injected into the lymphatics from the bile duct leaves the duct as it enters the lobule and is at once taken up by the lymph radicals and perilobular lymph spaces, and from them extends, as a secondary injec- tion, to the perivascular lymph spaces, and often into the blood capillaries of the lobule. The larger lymphatics accom- panying the portal vein arise between the lobules near their bases, while those accompanying the hepatic vein do not arise within the lobule but around the larger sublobular veins.

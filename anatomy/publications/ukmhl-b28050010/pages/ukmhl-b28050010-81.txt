81 falls into the first class of Wernicke’s descriptions,5 a condition occurring normally in some apes. As the fissure passes ven- trad a notable fact is the nature of the slope of its walls, which, as in the right half, incline distinctly caudomesad. It resem- bles a cleft rather than an ordinary fissure, and in its depths can be seen several interdigitating subgyres. As the fissure approaches the ventro-lateral border it takes an abrupt caudal direction and terminates jnst at the border. Around this end curves a narrow “quatrieme pli de passage.” The u troisieme pli” may be any one of the several interdigitating subgyres alluded to above. Upon the right half the “ troisieme pli” instead of being totally submerged, approaches to within seven millimeters of the surface and is- capped by the lip of the poma (occipital operculum), so that it may properly be termed a subgyre. The exoccipital fissure consists, therefore, of two segments, a

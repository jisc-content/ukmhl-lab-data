GrULLIVEli^S RESEARCHES. 8 simple and available, fundamental and universal, than any other single diagnostic; the raphides being constant and most easily found in the plant producing them, from its earliest state—even in the seed-leaves—and throughout its frame in all stages of its existence. Thus, for example, in our Elora, Balsaminacese can be at once surely known from the other orders of Thalamiflorse, Onagracese from the other orders of Calyciflorse, and Eubiaceae from the other orders of CorolMorse ; while, on the other hand, an order—Hydrocharidaceae, e. g.—may be as certainly distinguished by the want of raphides which abound in its allied orders (Yarious numbers of the Ann. Nat. Hist., 1861-65 ; Seemanii's Journ. Bot., March 1864 ; Quart. Journ. Micros. Science, Jan. 1864, July 1865, and—how and where easiest found—Hid.

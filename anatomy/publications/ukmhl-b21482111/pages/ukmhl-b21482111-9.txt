Gulliver's Reseaeches. 7 Aitkin's Science and Practice of Medicine., vol. 2, p. 867, 2nd cd., 8vo., Lend., 1863; T. Wharton Jones, Failure of Sight from rail- way and other injuries of the spine and head, p. 158, sm. 8vo., Lond., 1869), TUBERCLE. 1. —Site of Pulmonary Tubercle,—shown to be both inside and outside the air-cells (IsTote to "Wagner's Physiol., fig, 175, repeated in Todd's Cyclop. Anat. and Physiol., vol. 3, p. 755; Notes to Eoyd's Yital Statistics, Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ., vol. 60, July 1843; L. and E. Phil. Mag., Sep. 1842). 2. —Histological Characters.—Young "or grey miliary tubercles composed chiefly of cells about 1-2000th inch diameter; crude tubercle, of shrunken, degenerating, shapeless, blighted or wither- ing cells, with a preponderance of granular matter and oily particles, the fatty globules excessive in the brown consolidation of lung in phthisis (Gerber's Anat., App., plates xxix and xxxi; J^otes to Boyd's Statistics above cited; Drs. C. J. B. and Theodore Williams, on pulmonary consumption, Lancet, 1868). 3. —Endowments.—'Not plastic or histogenetic, but, on the contrary, hystolytic, or devoid of inherent power of developement or growth, as the cells from which tubercle originates and increases only retrograde or degenerate into amorphous and lifeless corpuscles, and into granular and molecular fatty matter, all incapable of vitality or organization (App, to Gerber's Anat. ; Notes to Boyd's Statistics, and Drs. C. J. B. and Theodore Williams, above cited ; Med. Chir. Trans., 1843), PUS-CORPUSCLES IN THE BLOOD. These abundant in certain diseases (L. and E. Phil, Mag., Sep. 1838, and 1842, figs. 1 and 2; Gerber's Anat,, App., page 20, fig. 269). PHYTOTOMY. 1. —TaxonomiG value of Pollen.—Allied species of plants dis- tinguished by their pollen-grains, as exemplified in Ranunculaccse and Leguminosese (Ann. Nat. Hist., July 1865 ; Seemann's Journal of Botany, with figures, Sep., 1866 ; Popular Science Eeview, July, 1868). 2. —Taxonomic value of Tissue-cells.—This exemplified in Juncese and Hymenophyllese (Ann. Nat. Hist., with engravings, Aug., Oct., and Dec, 1863 ; Seemann's Journ, Bot., with figures, Oct., 1863, and, with figure of Epidermis of Lemna trisulcay Jan. 1869). 3. —Raphides, Splicer aphides ^ and Crystal Prisms.—Their dis- tinctive characters. Extensive researches resulting in the discovery of the importance of raphides as natural characters in systematic botany; that they afford a true distinction which is often more

2 GuLLivER^s Researches. fractions of a millemcter (Milne-Edwairds, Leg d'Anat. Comp. et de Physiol., torn. 1, 8vo,, Paris, 1856). Several of the results are noted under the ton f )llowing paragraph-ciphers :— 1. —The Tragulidye and some other Ruminants have red cor- puscles smaller than any before known (Med, Chir. Tran., JNTov. 26, 1839, vol. 23 ; Dublin Med. Press, Jfov. 27, 1839 ; Proc. Zool. Soc, Aug. 9, 1842, May 9, 1843, and Peb. 10, 1870). 2. —The Edentates, on the other hand, are characterised by the large size of their red corpuscles (Proc. Zool. Soc, June 11, 1844, Jan. 24, 1854, and Eeb. 10, 1870). 3. —That, immediately after Mandl's discovery of the oval shape of the blood-disks of the Dromedary and Pace, these corpuscles are alike oval in every other member of the Camelidse ; while, more- over, all these corpuscles conform in size and structure to the mammalian or apyrenaematous type, and by no means to that of the lower or pyrensematous classes (Med. Chir. Trans., vol. 23; Lend, and Edin. Phil. Mag., Jan. 1840 ; IN'ote to Wagner, p. 237). 4. —lianceolate, fusiform, crescentic, and other irregular shapes, assumed by the majority of the corpuscles in certain Puminants (Lend, and Edin. Phil. Mag., with an engraving, JN'ov., 1840). 5. —'J'he size of the red corpuscles often affords good taxonomic characters (App. to Gerber; Proc. Zool. Soc, June 9, JSTov, 24, 1840, May 25, 1841, Eeb. 25, 1862, and Eeb. 10, 1870; IS'ote xcviii to Hewson). 6. — Though there may be no relation between the size of the corpuscles and that of the species (the Mouse and Horse, e. g.) of different orders of the class Mammalia, there is regularly so far such a relation in a single natural order or family of this class, that the smallest corpuscles occur among the small species and the largest corpuscles among the large species of such order or family (App. to (ierber; i^otes xcviii and cxviii^' to Hewson's Works; Proc. Zool. Soc, Eeb. 25, 1862, and Eeb. 10, 1870), 7. —Relation of the Size of the Corpuscles to Respiration (L. and E. Phil. Mag., Jan. 1840; Lecture ix, Med. Times and Gaz., Jan, 17, 1863; Proc Zool, Soc, Eeb. 10, 1870; Milne-Edwards, LoQ sur la Physiol., tom. 1, 8vo. Paris, 1856). 8. —In conformity with the comparative uniformity of the general organization of Birds, there is so little difference in the size of their red corpuscles that the whole class resembles in this respect a single order of Mammalia; in other words, these cor- puscles of Rirds are more uniform than the corpuscles of other classes or even of some orders of other Yertebrates. The short diameter of the oval red corpuscles of Birds answering to the diameter of the circular red corpuscles of Mammalia (App. to Gerber; Note xcviii to Hewson; Proc. Zool. Soc, Eeb, 25, 1862, and Eeb. 10, 1870). 9. —While of all oviparous Yertebrates the red corpuscles are nucleated, in all Mammalia these corpuscles are non-nucleated;

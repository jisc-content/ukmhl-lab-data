6 GuLLIVER^S ReSEAECHES. MUSCLES OE VERTEBRATES. 1, —Taxonomic value of the (Esophageal Sheath, with Tables of Measurements ot the primitive fascicles of different muscles (Proc. Zool. Soc, Sep, 10, 1839, June 14, 1842, April 22, 1869, and May 12, 1870). 2. —Stiffening of Muscles, and coagulation of blood, in animals killed either by hunting or fighting; contrary to the then current views of John Hunter (Edin. Med, and Surg, Journ., Oct. 1848 ; jS'otes iii and xii to Hewson's Works). TESTES. Tables of Measurements of the seminal tubes of Mammalia and Aves, with note on the histogenetic importance of minute molecules (Proc. Zool. Soc, July 26, 1842; Hewson's Works, ]S"otes Ix and cxliv ; Lectures, Med. Times and Gaz., Aug. 23 and I^^ov. 29, 1862, figs. 7, 11, and 14; Hunterian Oration, p, 9), PATTY DEQENERATIOI^S, Cholesterine, and other fatty matter, forming a diseased state in the coats of the arteries, shown to be the most common cause of spontaneous aneurysm of the large vessels, and of that similar weakening and rupture of the small vessels which is the proxi- mate cause of the most usual form of cerebral apoplexy. Eatty degenerations in organs and morbid products—testicle, Eright's and other diseases of the kidneys, the lungs, tubercle, e. g.—in which it had not then been recognised; and such degenerations the immediate cause of the decay or atrophy of sevc^ral animal tissues and diseased products (Med, Chir. Trans, vol. xxvi, Eeb. 28, 1843 ; Gerber, note, p, 190 ; JSTotes to Boyd's Yital Statistics, Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ., 1843, vol. 60 ; Paget's Lectures on Surg. Path,, Lec. vi, 8vo., Lond., 1863; Drs. J. C. B. and Theodore Williams, on pulmonary consumption, Lancet, Apl. 1868). SOFTENING OF FIBRIN. Discovery, by an extensive series of experiments and observa- tions, that softening of clots of fibrin is a distinct elementary disease, essentially different from suppuration, though these two diseases had always been confounded. Many years afterwards Prof. Yirchow published in Germany the facts as discoveries of his own, under the name of Thrombosis, and that mistake has long been aided and abetted in England (Med. Chir. Trans., 1839, vol. xxii; Gerber's Anat., note, p. 29 ; Notes to Boyd's Yital Statistics, Edin, Med. and Surg. Journ., 1843, vol. 60; .J, Davy, Diseases of the Army, pp. 267 and 288, 870., Lond., 1862; Hughes Bennett, Lectures on Molecular Physiol, and Path., Lancet, Apl. 1863 ;

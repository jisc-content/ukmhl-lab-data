5 Gulliver's Researches. PULMOI^AEY GLAND OF THE CA'ING WHALE, A distinct body of the same kind as the thymus (Proc. Zool. Soc, May 24, 1853 ; and Murie, on Globiocephalus, ihid., 1870. EISHES, 1. —Fibres of crystalline Zens,—Their thinness and smooth- ness in the Lampreys, and their differences affording taxonomic characters in the class (Monthly Journ. Micros. Sci., April 1, 1869). 2. —Fovea centralis Retince, in the family of Sparidae.—(Journ. Anat. and Physiol., IS'ov. 1867). 3. —The Lampreys,—though currently described as * Dermop- teri' devoid of Ein-rays, have these rays. The Genital outlet a single tubular process in each sex. Platyelminthes in the brain (Proc. Zool. Soc, with engravings, Dec. 6, 1870), 4. —Nondescript Ossicles, see Bones. LriNG. Elastic tissue covering the lung, and an agent in expiration, especially in the Horse (Kote, p. 360, to Wagner). BOISTES. 1. —Nondescript Ossicles in the Skull of osseous Eish (Ann. ISTat. Hist., Dec, 1869). 2. —Reparation of Fractures, not necessarily a process like that of the original growth, since such flat bones as are developed in membrane may be repaired through a provisional basis of cartilage (Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ., July 1835 ; Gerber's Anat. l^ote, p. 177). 3. —Experiments on Fractures of the Patella.—These fractures proved to unite by osseous matter, when the fragments are kept in contact by the more or less integrity of their fibrous covering j but when this tissue is completely ruptured, the fractured surfaces cannot be so kept together, and hence unite by ligament only. Thus the then conflicting opinions as to the re-union by bone or by membrane of intracapsular fractures of bones were reconciled (Edin, Med. and Surg. Journ., Jan. 1837). 4. —Dissection of a Fractured Cervix Femoris in which there was inversion of the limb (Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ., Oct. 1836), 5. — Cases of Shortening of the Cervix Femoris, independently of fractures, in young persons (Edin. Med. and Surg. Journ., July and Oct. 1836). 6. —Necrosis.—Experiments showing that the then prevailing doctrine as to the removal of the sequestrum by the absorbents is erroneous. Dead bone ingrafted on living bone (Med. Chir. Trans. voL xxi, 1838).

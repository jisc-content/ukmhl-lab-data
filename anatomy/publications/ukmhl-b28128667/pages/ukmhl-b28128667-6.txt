IV There is as yet, no Universal Anatomical Nomenclature — in the original German work the B. N. A. nomenclature is employed, but among English Ana- tomists the nomenclature is very variable, at one time purely classical at an- other purely English, frequently a mixture. I have endeavoured to give the terms most frequently employed in England, with a further inclination whenever possible, to an English rather than a Classical term. In connection with the question of nomenclature, the reader is advised to peruse Toldt’s Atlas, wherein all synonyms are well explained. London, W. J. Howell Evans.

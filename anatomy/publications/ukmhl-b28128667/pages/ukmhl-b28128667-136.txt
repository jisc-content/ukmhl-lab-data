Fig. 83. Right Antecubital Space. Deep Layer. Skin, Superficial, and Deep Fasciae have been removed. The following muscles are exposed: Biceps with Bicipital Fascia, Brachialis Antic us, as far as it is not-covered by Vessels and Nerves, the upper portion of the Superficial Flexors which arise from the Internal Condyle, especially the Pronator Radii Teres. The Brachio-Radialis which has at its upper portion been drawn out- wards, is also displayed. (As to the superficial nerves and veins which have been left in this spe- cimen, see Fig. 82 text.) The Brachial Artery runs, accompanied by its Venae Comites, along the inner border of the Biceps, towards the acute angle formed by the Pronator Radii Teres and the Brachio-Radialis Muscles. In its course, - in front of the line of the joint â€” it divides into the more superficial and smaller Radial, and the more deeply placed and larger Ulnar Artery. Internal to the Brachial Artery (or rather to its Internal Vena Comes) runs the Median Nerve which may, however, He more than 2/5th inch internal to the vessel. This nerve pierces the Pronator Radii Teres and supplies the Superficial and the Deep Flexors of the forearm, except the Flexor Carpi Ulnaris and the inner portion of the Flexor Profundus Digitorum (cf. Fig. 89). Along the outer border of the Biceps runs, at a deeper level, the Musculo- Spiral Nerve; this Nerve lies between the Brachio-Radialis and Brachialis Anticus Muscles (cf. Fig. 89). The mass of muscles arising from the Internal Condyle of the Humerus and the portion of bone above it, and from the deep fascia of the forearm, sepa- rates lower down into the Pronator Radii Teres which is inserted at the middle of the outer border of the Radius, into the Flexor Carpi Radialis going to the base of the 2nd Metacarpal Bone, into the Palmaris Longus, which is not always present, and into the Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, which arises also from the Ulna. The lymphatic glands are described in Figs. 89 and 115 text.

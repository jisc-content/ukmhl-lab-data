in Fig. 18. Fig. 19. Cranio-Cerebral Topography. The bars of A. Koehler's “Craniencephalometer” are dark red; Brain pink, diagrammatic. For practical purposes it is very important to know the surface markings for the different parts of the hemisphere. By such knowledge a diagnosis can be made of: “Which cortical region is affected in any particular injury of the Skull?” On the other hand, functional disturbances may indicate disease of a certain part of the Cortex which may require operation; by this knowledge of surface markings the surgeon is enabled to find the seat of the lesion. Generally speaking it is sufficient to determine the position of the Fissures of Rolando and Sylvius because the most important centres are situated in the neighbourhood of these fissures (cf. Fig. 3, 5) further with these landmarks other sulci and fissures can be easity marked out. Many methods have been devised, some requiring special instruments. Koehler’s method is simple and reliable. Cf. Fig. Three lines are necessary. 1. A Sagittal line extending from the root of the nose to the External Occipital Protuberance. 2. A Vertical line through the Anterior Border of the External Auditory Meatus. 3. A second Vertical line parallel to the former through the Posterior Border of the Mastoid Process. From the point where the last mentioned line meets the Sagittal line another line is drawn downwards and forwards to a point situated midway between the junction of the middle with the lower thirds and the mid-point of the first Vertical Line. This point corresponds to the lower end of the Rolandic Fissure, the upper end of which lies at the junction of the line drawn from the Sagittal Line. The Fissure of SYLVIUS lies Y2 inch below the inferior end of the Fissure of Rolando. About 2Y2 inches above the Zygoma the Short Anterior and Long Posterior Limbs of this fissure begin. Another excellent method of marking out the Fissures of Rolando and Sylvius, devised by Kroenlein, is described

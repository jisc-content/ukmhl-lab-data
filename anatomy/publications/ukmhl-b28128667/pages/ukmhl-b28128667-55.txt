Fig. 29. Superficial Vessels and Nerves of the Head. Skin, Parotid Gland, portion of the Orbicularis Palpebrarum and Square Muscle of the Upper Lip (Quadratus Labii Superioris), have been removed. The Superficial Arteries, Veins, Nerves and Muscles have been exposed by dissection. Light red, Arteries. Passing upward over the lower jaw is the Facial Artery which shews through the Muscles as it is covered by them: in front of the Ear the Temporal Artery gives off the Transverse Facial Artery. At the upper border of the Orbit the Frontal Artery (a branch of the Ophthalmic Artery which comes off the Internal Carotid) is seen and at the back is the Occipital Artery. Violet, Veins. The Facial Vein (anastomosing, at the Naso-frontal Angle, with the Frontal Vein and indirectly with the Intracranial Venous System) is seen communicating with the Temporal Vein which lies in front of the Pinna. Posteriorly the Occipital Vein is seen. The Facial Nerve and its branches are white. (Cf. Figs. 33—38.) The other nerves are coloured in accordance with their area of distribution. (Cf. Figs. 33-38.) Dark red — Ophthalmic Division of Vth Nerve. (F, 1). Yellow — Superior Maxillary Division of Vth Nerve (F, 2). [z—t indicates Zygomatico-Temporal, and z—f Temporal-Facial Branches). Blue — Inferior Maxillary Division of Vth Nerve (F, 3). This gives off the Auriculo-Temporal Nerve (a—l) before the Inferior Dental enters its Foramen. Orange — Auricular Branches of Vagus (X) to the Pinna (Arnold). Black — Cervical Nerves: Great Auricular, Great and Small Occipital and Superficial Cervical Nerves. The Duct of the Parotid Gland (Stenson’s Duct) and its small tributaries are coloured light brown.

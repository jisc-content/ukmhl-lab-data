Fig. 126. Left Lung and Spleen. — Side View. The figure shews the diaphragm during extreme expiration (cadaveric expiration); the vault extends as high as the 4th left intercostal space and the left lung to the same degree. The fissure of the Lung — the left boundary of the pleura, cf. Figs. 116 and 117 — and especially the normal position of a normal spleen are shewn. The inner concave surface of the spleen lies against the Fundus of the Stomach and the upper part of the left kidney (cf. Fig. 135), the convexity is in relation with the Diaphragm connected with it by the Phrenico-Splenic Ligament. The spleen extends from (cf. Fig. 125) the 9th to the nth rib with its long axis corresponding to the long axis of the 10th rib, in a downward and forward direction, so that the inferior pole points towards the Umbilicus. A normal spleen does not extend beyond the costo-chondral line — i. e. a line drawn from the left Sterno-clavicular articulation to the top of the nth rib. Through the Sacro-Sciatic Foramen the lower part of the Sigmoid Flexure and the Rectum are visible. The convex diaphragmatic surface of the spleen is shewn; as the spleen is a viscus subject to many forms of enlargement, it is desirable to learn the direction in which its increase in size must extend. The upper concave surface is in relation with the fundus of the Stomach; this frequently prevents a permanent enlargement upwards. The lower surface rests upon solid viscera -— left kidney, Pancreas and left Supra-renal glands — which under normal conditions cannot easily be pushed aside. The Phrenico-Splenic Ligament prevents expansion vertically downwards, but it affords a gliding surface along which the spleen may when enlarged slide forwards and downwards. It is thus that the anterior pole of an enlarged spleen is most readily felt at the anterior border of the 10th rib.

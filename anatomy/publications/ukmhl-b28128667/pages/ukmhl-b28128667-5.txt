Preface. Nearly every Student of Anatomy and every Practitioner feels the need of some book which shall, for the former, serve as a supplement to dissection and assist in the study of prepared anatomical specimens and which, for the latter who cannot spare the time for the study of specimens or whose work will not countenance any contact with the cadaver, shall present the regional im- portant structures. Such a book must present Anatomical data by numerous and good illustrations, the important details depicted must be presented in a systematic, clear, and practical manner. For such merits and to meet these requirements this English Version has been prepared; it is hoped, therefore, that this book will serve as a means of revision among Students, as a valuable reference both of applied Anatomy to the Practitioner, and as a means of quickening the weakening memories of the Surgeon. The selection of the Plates and their extent has been determined by their relative clinical importance; special attention has beeil directed to those regions which have, of recent years, become of increased interest to the Physician and Surgeon; so that those portions of Anatomy which are likely to be of actual service to the Student in his subsequent study, and to the Practitioner in his clinical work, form the basis of each plate. Lithographic Plates for the finer and Wood-cuts for the coarser detail, when coloured, are undoubtedly the best means of illustrating Anatomy and Histology; because by these methods the exact relations and distinctness of different structures in the various planes are most admirably shewn. This book cannot replace, and is not intended to replace, the Textbook of Anatomy, but is of great use with the more comprehensive Anatomical Works and Atlases. There

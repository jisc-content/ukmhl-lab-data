Fig. 156. Male Perineum. III. Prostate. COWPER’s Gland with Ducts. Terminal Branches of Internal Pudic Artery. The Vessels and Nerves have been cut away in the posterior part of the Peri- neum. The Corpus Spongiosum has been denuded of its muscles and laid open so as to exhibit the course of the Artery to the Bulb and the Ducts of Cowper s Glands. The Prostate has been exposed by removal of the fbres of the Levator Ani and Sphincter Ani Muscles which cover it. This figure is given for the demonstration of the position of Cowper's Glands and their ducts which vary from 175th to 31/5ths inches in length; whereas their diameter is 0.02 inch and their lumen 0.01 inch. The Glands themselves, not always symmetrical, are situated about V5 inch from the middle line on either side of the membranous portion of the Urethra between the 2 layers of the triangular ligament, near is posterior border and between the fibres of the Compressor Urethrae. These glands are lobulated or mulberry- shaped, hard, almost white in colour, about l/6 to 2/s inch long. They belong to the racemose type of glands and vary according to the individual and age but are frequently unobserved owing to incomplete dissection. The Artery to the Bulb (a branch of the Internal Pudic) consisting of two vessels (cf. Fig. 154), supplies the Bulb, Prostate and the structures which lie between the 2 layers of the triangular ligament, e. g. Compressor Urethrae Muscle, Membranous Portion of Urethra, Cowper’s Gland and Corpus Spongiosum as far as the Gians Penis. At this point it anastomoses with the Dorsal Artery of the Penis and through this with the Arteries of the Corpora Cavernosa.

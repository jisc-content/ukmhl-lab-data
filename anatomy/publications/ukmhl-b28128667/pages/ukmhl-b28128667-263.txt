Fig. 158. Male Perineum. V. Prostate, Seminal Vesicles, COWPER’s Glands, Urethra passing through the Urogenital Triangle. Anns and surrounding parts — the Sphincter Ani completely and the Levator Ani Muscle partially (window-section) — have been removed; Prostate, Seminal Vesicles, Bladder and Douglas’ Pouch are partly exposed from below and in front, also the central point of the Perineum in front of the Prostate Gland. Passing from the Tip of the Coccyx forwards to the anterior margin of the cut Levator Ani Muscle the following parts are seen in order: — Transverse Section through the Rectum, Peritoneum of Douglas’ Pouch, Waldeyer’s Interampullary Triangle with the base of the Bladder; on either side lie the Ampullae of the Vasa Deferentia with the Seminal Vesicles anteriorly. Between the last named and the Prostate the Interampullary Muscle runs transversely. Next in order is the Prostate Gland with the central point of the Peri- neum directly in front, whereas further forward are exhibited to view the Urethra and the accessory glands entering the Ducts of Cowper’s Glands. Special attention is called to Kalischer’s Urogenital Sphincter Muscle which is very variable, yet possesses many anatomical and physiological relations. At various times this has been described by JOHANNES Müller as the Con- strictor of the Membranous portion of the Urethra, by Fr. Arnold as the Ure- thral Muscle; as Guthrie’s muscle; by Cruveilhier as the Transverse Urethral and Ischio-Urethral Muscle; by KRAUSE and KOHLRAUSCH as the Transverse Urethral Muscle; J. Henle associates it with the Deep Transverse Perineal Muscle (Compressor Urethrae). Cf. the next figure.

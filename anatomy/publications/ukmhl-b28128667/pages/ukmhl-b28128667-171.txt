Pigs. 109 and no. Nerve-Supply of the Muscles of the Upper Extre- mity, according to their Segmental (Spinal) Origin. The segments are given partly according to WlCHMANN and BOLK, partly after ZIEHEN. In the text, Arabic figures represent the Cemical Segments, the first Dorsal is indicated by a Roman I. Colours as in Figs. 107 and 108. The ventral muscles of the superficial layer of the shoulder-girdle are the Sterno- Mastoid and Pectoralis Major; those of the deep layer the Subclavius and Pectoralis Minor. That portion of the Spinal Accessory Nerve which supplies the Stemo-Mastoid Muscle contains 2. C. and 3. C. The Anterior Thoracic Nerves divide into several branches; the upper segments are for the Pectoralis Major 5. C., 6. C., 7. C. (Clavicular portion 5. C.), the lower segments are for the Pectoralis Minor 7. C., 8. C.; 8. C. in some cases also supplies the lowest fibres of the Pectoralis Major. The Nerve to the Subclavius Muscle is composed of fibres derived from 5. C. and 6. C. The superficial layer of the Extensor Muscles of the Shoulder-Girdle is composed of the Trapezius and Latissimus Dorsi; in the majority of cases the Spinal Accessory Nerve to the Trapezius Muscle contains 2., 3. and 4. C., the long Subscapular Nerve to the Latissimus Dorsi Muscle 6., 7. and 8. C. The other Subscapular Nerves to the Teres Major Muscle 5., 6. (and 7.) C.; to the Subscapularis Muscle 5. and 6. C, the Supra- scapular Nerve to the Supraspinatus Muscle 5. C, to the Infraspinatus Muscle 5. and 6. C. The deep Nay er is composed of the Serratus Magnus with Bell’s Nerve 5., 6. and 7. C.; Levator Scapulae (3.) 4. and 5. C. and the Rhomboid Muscles 5. C., possibly further fibres from 4. C. to the Rhomboideus Minor Muscle. Of the mixed nerves, the Median contains fibres derived from each segment, 5., 6., 7., 8. C. and I. D. — (though 5. C. probably contains Sensory fibres only). — The motor part of the Musculo-Cutaneous Nerve contains fibres from 5., 6. and 7. C.; the Ulnar Nerve usually 7. and 8. C. and I. D. or 8. C. and I. D. only. The motor part of the Circumflex 5. and 6. C. The motor part of the Musculo-Spiral (5. C.) 6., 7. and 8. C. Musculo-Cutaneous Nerve: Coraco-Brachialis Muscle 6. and 7. C.; Biceps Muscle 5. and 6. C.; Brachialis Anticus Muscle 5. and 6. C. This last named muscle has a double Nerve-supply as it also receives fibres from the Musculo-Spiral Nerve (derived from the same segments). Median Nerve: Pronator Radii Teres Muscle 6. and 7. C.; Flexor Carpi Radialis 6. and 7. (and 8.) C.; Palmaris Longus 7. and 8. C. and I. D.; Flexor Sublimis Digitorum 7. and 8. C. and I. D.; Flexor Longus Pollicis 6., 7. (and 8.) C.; Pronator Quadratus (6.) 7. and 8. C. and I. D.; Muscles of the Thenar Eminence 6. and 7. C. The two outer Lumbrical Muscles are usually considered to be supplied from 8. C. and I. D. segments. Ulnar Nerve: Flexor Carpi Ulnaris Muscle (7.) 8. C. and I. D.; the outer (radial) portion may also be supplied by the Median Nerve (Frohse) thus having a double Nerve-supply, like the following muscle; Flexor Profundus Digitorum (Ulnar and Median) 7., 8. C. and I. D. The deep portion of the Ulnar contains 8. C. and I. D., but chiefly 8. C.; at the Hypothenar Eminence even the 7. C. may take part (Bolk). For the Motor Anastomosis between the Ulnar and Median Nerves cf. Figs. 84 and 96. The Circumflex Nerve contains fibres from the 5th and 6th Cervical Segments. The small area of Deltoid Muscle coloured green denotes the probability, as evidenced by clinical observations, that fibres from 4. C. supply this portion (Ziehen). The Anterior part of the Deltoid may be supplied by the Anterior Thoracic Nerves (Anastomosis with the Circumflex, Frohse). The nerve to the Teres Minor Muscle usually only contains 5. C. Ifor Long Head of Triceps 6., 7. and 8. C. for Outer Head of Triceps 6., 7. (and 8.) C. for Inner Head of Triceps (6.), 7. and 8. C. for Anconeus 7. and 8. C. Brachio-Radialis (Supinator Longus) 5. and 6. C. Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior and Brevior (5.) 6. and 7. C. Supinator Brevis 5., 6. (and 7.) C. Extensor Communis Digitorum and Extensor Minimi Digiti 6., and 7. and 8. C. Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis 6., 7. (and 8.) C. Extensor Indicis 6., 7. and 8. C. Extensor Secundi Internodii Pollicis 6., 7. (and 8.) C. (in Bolk’s case 7. C. only).

Fig. 153. Frontal Section through Male Pelvis. Levator Ani Muscle. Frozen section. Through the body of a Male of middle age a section has been made almost parallel with the pelvic axis, so that the plane of section is not accurately frontal. This figure is intended to complete the series Figs. 151 and 152; only a short description is necessary. The Bladder B with its overlying peritoneum is, in front of the plane of section, visible above the black lines which delineate the peritoneum. All other structures except the Rectum and the folds of the buttocks and parts of the thigh lie in a frontal plane, i. e. lower part of the Bladder, Ampullae of Vasa Deferentia, external to these (cf. Fig. 151) the Seminal Vesicles and directly below the last mentioned the Rectal Wall. Very instructive is the divided Obturator Internus Muscle, which can be felt bulging on examination of the Female Pelvis, and especially the direction of the Levator Ani which arises at the upper border of the Obturator Internus from the White line and approaches the Rectum in a funnel-shaped manner to sur- round it and terminate in the External Anal Sphincter. This muscle may be con- sidered to consist of many parts. At the commencement of the funnel it is markedly thickened (Constrictor of the Vagina). Near the Obturator Internus Muscle are situated the Internal Pudic Vessels and Nerve (cf. Fig. 154) covered by Fascia (not seen in the figure). On either side of the Rectum are seen the Ischio-Rectal Fossae filled with fat. The last part of the Rectum only as it runs obliquely downwards and backwards has been cut through; the upper part lies in front of the plane of section as viewed from behind.

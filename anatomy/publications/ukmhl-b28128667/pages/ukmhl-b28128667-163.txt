Fig. 102. Horizontal Section through the Dorsum of the Right Hand; Articulations. A horizontal section has exposed to view from the dorsal aspect all the arti- culations which lie between the forearm above and the Metacarpal bones below, but those joints which do not lie in the plane of the section have been opened independently, viz: a) Cuneiform — Pisiform, b) Trapezium — ist Metacarpal. The following Joint Cavities or combination of Joint Cavities are found in the hand: — 1) Joint between Radius, Scaphoid & Semilunar extending almost to the Cuneiform but separated from the following joint by the Triangular Articular Fibro-Cartilage, “the Radio-Carpal Articulation”, the Wrist Joint Proper. 2) Joint between Head of Ulna, Radius and Inter-articular Fibro-Cartilage, “the Inferior Radio-Ulnar Articulation”. 3) Joint between the Cuneiform and Pisiform Bones. 4) Joint between the Trapezium and the ist Metacarpal Bone. 5) Joint between the Unciform Bone and the bases of the 4th and 5th Metacarpal Bones; this may communicate with the following (6). 6) Combination of the joint cavities between the distal surfaces of the Scaphoid, Semilunar and Cuneiform Bones, the proximal surface of the Unciform Bone, all the articular surfaces of the Os Magnum and the Trapezoid, the inner surface of the Trapezium and the bases of the 2nd and 3rd Metacarpal Bones. “Intercarpal and Carpo-Metacarpal Articulation”. The wide extension of No. 6 forms an important point in the spreading of pathological processes. The Dorsal and Palmar ligaments of the Carpal Joints are very strong so that extreme Dorsiflexion (e. g. as in a fall on the hand) is more likely to result in a fracture of the lower end of the radius than in a rupture of these ligaments. (LECOMTE; cf. the behaviour of the malleoli, in particular the external or fibular.)

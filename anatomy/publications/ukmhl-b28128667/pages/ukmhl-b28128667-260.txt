Fig* I57* Male Perineum. IV. Urogenital Triangle. Ampulla of Rectum. The deep layer of the triangular ligament is exposed on the left side by remov- ing the superficial layer of the triangular ligament and the Corpus Spongiosum as far as the middle line; the Urethra, Coivper’s Gland, the left Corpus Caver- nosum and the Dorsal Artery of the Penis have, however, been preserved. In front of the Transverse Perineal Muscle, the Compressor Urethrae Muscle (the Muscle of the Urogenital Triangle of Waldeyer) is shewn. This muscle arising from the bony margin of the Pelvis (Ischium and Pubis) and the fibrous portion of the Ischio-Cavernosus Muscle, passes to join its fellow of the opposite side in the middle line. The outlines of the Bulb are delineated in blue; Cowper’s Glands and Duct which are not exposed by the dissection (cf. Fig. 156) are also indicated. Anteriorly the Compressor Urethrae Muscle is connected with the Trans- verse Pelvic Ligament which may be looked upon as an aponeurotic covering of the muscle or as a blending together of the superficial and deep layers of the triangular ligament. Waldeyer has named this the Preurethral Ligament; emerging through the fibres near the anterior border of the Compressor Urethrae Muscle, the Dorsal Artery of the Penis is seen; this vessel a branch of the Internal Pudic soon gives off the artery to the Corpus Cavernosum. The chief object of this figure is to give an idea of the position and size of the Ampulla of the Rectum when distended (red). In this part of the Rectum which lies above the Anus and which is capable of considerable distension faeces may, and frequently do, accumulate if the bowel is not emptied. On the right side an abnormal Muscle the Ischio-Bulbosus is shewn between the Ischio- and Bulbo-Cavernosus Muscles.

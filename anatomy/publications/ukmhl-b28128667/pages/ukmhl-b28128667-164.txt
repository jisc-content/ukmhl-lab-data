Fig. 103. Transverse Section through Carpus. Frozen section viewed from the Fingers. The second row of Carpal Bones and the Styloid Process of the 3rd Metacarpal Bone have been sawn through. On the back of the hand the Extensor Tendons, on the outer side the Extensor Ossis Metacarpi and the Extensor Primi Internodii Pollicis, in the palm of the hand the Flexor Tendons are shewn in their relations to each other and to the Bones of the Hand. The Concavity of the Carpus with the tunnel completed by the Anterior Annular Ligament are well shewn. Note: Radial Artery; Ulnar Artery, and Nerve. The Median Nerve becoming more superficial at the wrist, lies in close approximation to the Flexor Sheath, and directly under the Palmar Fascia. (Vide Figs. 98 and 101.) Fig. 104. Transverse Section through Palm of Hand. Frozen Section. Left Hand, seen from the fingers. The P'lexor and Extensor Tendons have diverged towards either the inner (ulnar) or outer (radial) side. The median nerve has divided into many branches. The fleshy muscles of the Thenar and Hypothenar Eminences are evident. The Radial and Ulnar Arteries have divided so that the smaller branches of the Radial, with the exception of the Princeps Pollicis artery, are scarcely visible; the branches of the Ulnar Artery are readily found accompanying the nerves on the Palmar aspect near the 4th Metacarpal Bone. The Palmar Fascia which bridges over the space between the Thenar and Hypothenar Eminences is of great practical importance, because the skin is bound firmly to it so that suppuration deep to the fascia, i. e. around the Tendons or their sheath, becomes pent up, and deep incisions become necessary for the evacuation of the pus. The concavity of the hand is well shewn. (Cf. Foot.)

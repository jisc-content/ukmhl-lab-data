Fig* ISS* Male Perineum. II. Recto-Urethral Muscle. Prostate. The Perineum is exposed by a triangular window section. The Vessels and Nerves have been completely removed. By dividing and throwing back the Anal Sphincter the Recto-Urethral Muscle has been exposed to view and the Prostate exhibited by separation of some of the thin fibres of the Levator Ani. In front of the Anus the divided Superficial Anal Sphincter fibres are shewn, anteriorly in the narrow space between them deeper fibres which pass trans- versely, further forward the retracted fibres of the Levator Ani Muscle; and between these fibres and the Central point stretches the Recto-Urethral Muscle which blends, posteriorly, with the Levator Ani Muscle and the Rectal Wall, anteriorly, with the Transverse Perineal Muscle, the Raphe and the fibres of the Bulbo-Cavernosus Muscles as well as the Membranous Portion (Waldeyer) of the Urethra. On either side of the Recto-Urethral Muscle the Prostate is exposed to view. (This dissection can be carried out in the course of operations.) In the triangle between the Superficial Transverse Perineal Muscle and the Pubic Angle, the superficial fascia of the Perineum which covers the Ischio- and Bulbo-Cavernosus Muscles is seen on the right side. On the left side the fascia has been removed so that the muscles mentioned and the superficial layer of the triangular ligament are exposed. The Superficial Fascia is a true superficial fascia, but the triangular liga- ment is an Aponeurosis (v. BARDELEBEN).

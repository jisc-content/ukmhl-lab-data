Fig. hi. Thorax and Abdomen. The Trunk is divided into two chief divisions; the upper is the Thorax (Chest) and the lower is the Abdomen (Belly). The superficial line of separation between these two regions follows the lower margin of the bones and cartilages which comprise the thoracic cage, but this surface marking by no means indicates the relative size of these cavities. This curved line only shews the attachment of the base of the diaphragm which is in constant movement so that the capacity of these cavities is ever varying and the position of the more movable viscera alter accordingly. Certain points and connecting lines are employed in order to subdivide these regions and thereby endeavours are made to traverse or map out certain important viscera or visceral domains. The most important lines and regions are marked in the figure: to the black lines have been added red lines in order that the most important Con- tinental and English guides may be pictured. The reader is however strongly recommended to appreciate the multi- plicity of viscera] surface markings by reference to the following authorities: Atlas of Human Anatomy, Toldt. Textbook of Anatomy, Cunningham. Quainâ€™s Anatomy. Surgical Anatomy, Deaver.

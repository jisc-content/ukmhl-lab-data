Fig. 146. Median Section through Female Pelvis; Bladder and Rectum being empty. Median section through the body of a woman aged yo. In this instance, owing either to pathological adhesions or post-mortem changes, the Uterus did not lie directly on the Bladder, it'has, therefore, been drawn forward into the position of anteversion and anteflexion in accordance with the general investigations upon living subjects. When the bladder is empty the normal position of the uterus during life is anteverted (virgins) and anteflexed (women) i. e. the Uterus lies on the postero- superior aspect of the bladder (B. Schultze). Whether coils of small intestine lie between the Uterus and Bladder or whether other varieties normally exist we have not definitely decided. As the bladder becomes distended the Uterus is pushed upwards and backwards. The course of the Vagina is S-shaped, like the Rectum and Urethra. Into its upper cul-de-sac the Cervix Uteri protrudes, thus forming an Anterior and Posterior Fornix of which the latter is separated from the Pouch of DOUGLAS by 725t:h inch. (Operation route.) The empty bladder evidences a slight impression due to the body of the Uterus. An “uterine impression” can also be recognized on the distended bladder. The S-shaped Urethra (i3/5th inch long) enters the bladder at an acute angle. The Peritoneum does not extend so far down on the posterior aspect of the Rectum (3rd Sacral Segment) as upon its Anterior Aspect (ist Segment of Coccyx). Levator Ani, External and Internal Anal Sphincter Muscles are shewn in the figure. Lastly the extremity of the Dural Sac of the Spinal Cord is seen termin- ating at the level of the 2nd Segment of the Sacrum.

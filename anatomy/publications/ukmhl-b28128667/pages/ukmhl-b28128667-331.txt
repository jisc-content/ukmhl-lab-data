Fig. 200. Horizontal Section through the (Right) Foot near the Sole. Frozen Section. The distal half of the yth Metatarsal Bone has been freed by dissection. The result of the arching of the foot is that the body-weight is received only by a few points of the skeleton of the foot, namely:â€” behind; the Inner Tubercle of the OsCalcis; in front on the outer side: the Head, also the base of the 5th Metatarsal Bone; on the inner side: the Head of the ist Metatarsal Bone though many consider that owing to the mobility of this bone the head of the 2nd Metatarsal Bone should be looked upon as the supporting point. According to H. VON Meyer the 3rd Metatarsal Bone should be viewed as the point of support as the other bones only serve for the purpose of preventing the foot from capsizing to either side. However this may be, foot-prints teach 11s that only the heel, outer margin of foot, balls of toes and toes themselves, touch the ground normally; when the inner margin meets the ground we have to deal with Flat-Foot. The section shews definitely the share taken by the different bones in this arrangement. The Metatarsal Bones lie at different levels; the heads of the inner three have been divided by the section which passes throughout the length of the 4th and only through the base of the 5th Metatarsal (of which its distal half has been freed by dissection). In the figure is seen the Bursa on the outer aspect of the Little Toe opposite the Metatarso-phalangeal Articulation; this the most prominent point on the outer margin of the foot is frequently the seat of a corn produced by pressure from the boot. Inflammation readily reaches this Bursa whence it spreads to the joint which is often in communication with the Bursa.

Fig* I59* Male Perineum. VI. Pubic Region. Levator Ani Muscle. The Levator Ani Muscle has been exposed, a part of the Urethra below the point at which it traverses the Triangular Ligament has been removed. The vessels are preserved but the nerves, except the Dorsal Nerve of the Penis, have been cut away. This figure shews almost the complete surface of the Levator Ani Muscle with its different parts and the incomplete gap anteriorly. Some of the veins which traverse it have been preserved on the left side. Posteriorly1 the close relation which the Coccygeus bears to this muscle (of which it really should be regarded as a part) is seen. Furthermore through the gap in the anterior part of the Levator Ani, the Recto-Urethral Muscle (cf. Fig. 155), the Compressor Urethrae Muscle encircling the Urethra by some of its fibres whereas others pass transversely across in front of it can be seen. The Transverse Pelvic Ligament (or the Pre-urethrae Liga- ment of WALDEYER) runs across in front of a gap (for the transmission of veins). Between this ligament and the Suspensory Ligament of the Penis which is attached to the lower border of the Symphysis, is situated the gap for the passage of the superficial vessels of the Penis. The Dorsal Arteries of the Penis are seen anastomosing in this figure, and the Dorsal Vein is seen to have bifurcated into Left and Right branches. The lumen of the Urethra, where it passes through the triangular ligament is almost circular if the mucous folds, which become obliterated during the passage of urine or of an instrument, be neglected. In this Distal portion of the Urethra as it is embedded in the Corpus Spongiosum the Lumen is more oval. Flere the separ- ation between the Corpus Spongiosum and Corpora Cavernosa is most distinct.

45 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. with the latissimus dorsi, which partly covers it. From these origins the fibres pass downwards and inwards to be inserted Into the two anterior thirds of the outer edge of llie crista ilii, forming- a free posterior fleshy edge, winch passes vertically from the last rib to the ilium ; the fibres of the muscle are then continued obliquely downwards and forwards to the linea semilunaris, and are there intimately blended with the tendons of the internal oblique and trans- versalis muscles; from this line its, tendinous fibres are continued in the same direction with its fleshy fibres to the middle of the abdomen, where, by interlacing with the tendon of its fellow of the opposite side, they together form the linea alba, into which if is said they osq inserted; but besides this insertion, the iliac portion of the muscle also sends forth a tendon from the anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium, which forms a thick free edge, passes over the flexor muscles, vessels and nerves of the thigh, to the upper part of the pubes, to which it is fixed; being however above continuous with the rest of the tendon of the external oblique muscle. This free edge is termed Poupart’s ligament, and forms the crural arch ; its connection with the os pubis is threefold, as about an inch and a half from the bone it splits into two pillars, and thus produces an opening- which is termed the external abdominal ring; the superior and internal pillar is broad and flattened, and is attached to the symphisis pubis, its fibres decussating those of the opposite side; the external and inferior pillar is round and strong, and passes to be inserted into the spinous process of the pubes; and from the posterior edge of this pillar a thin process of tendon runs backwards and outwards to be attached to about half an inch of the linea ilio pectinea, which is termed Gimbernat’s ligament: it pro- duces a concave edge looking upwards and outwards, and forms a boundary to the inner side of the femoral sheath. Where Poupart’s ligament divides into the two pillars to be attached to the pubes, as has already been mentioned, a space is left, which is termed the external abdominal ring ;

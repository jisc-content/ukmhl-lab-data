DESCRimVK ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS, 233 even patholog’y, all tend to illustrate the different functions of Uiis joint. Capsular ligament.—This ligament envelops the joint. > It arises from the neck of the scapula, and adheres to the gle- noid ligament, over which it passes; then expands itself, to surround the head of the os humeri; and contracts again, as it extends downwards, to be inserted into the neck of the humerus; reaching as far as the tubercles of this bone, where it is inseparably connected with the tendinous inser- tions of the teres minor, spinati and subscapularis muscles. This capsule, where it extends from the greater to the smaller tubercle of the humerus, leaves a foramen for the pas- sage of the tendon of the long’ head of the biceps muscle. The capsular ligament is not of a uniform thickness, being thinnest on its outer and hinder part; but here it is strengthened by the tendons of the teres minor and infra spinatus muscles. On the inner side towards the axilla, where there is no tendinous expansion to give it support, it is found sufficiently strong and unyielding to prevent the displacement of the head of the humerus in that direction by any ordinary force. Besides the support which this liga- ment receives from the tendons of muscles, it derives addi- tional strength from strong fasciae, which extend from the acromion and coracoid processes of the scapula: it is espe- cially fortified by a fascia from the anterior part of the trian- gular or coraco acromial ligament, which is found immedi- ately underneath the belly of the deltoid muscle; and further by the accessory ligament, which is situated on the fore and inner side of the articulation, proceeding from the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tuberosity of the hu- merus, connecting itself with the tendon of the infra spinatus muscle. We find that the capsular ligament of this joint is more lax than is necessary for the mere junction of the two bones which it connects, in order to allow the free and various motions of which the shoulder-joint (constituted, as its form shews, rather for mobility than strength), is so capable.

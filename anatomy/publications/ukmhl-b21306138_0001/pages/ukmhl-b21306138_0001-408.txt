22 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, vegetative life; so that it may be justly concluded, that the involuntary functions depend upon the nerves, but are influenced also by the brain. There is yet a third class of muscles, which seems to form a link between the other two; they are termed the mixed muscles: the best example of which we have in the muscles of respiration, destined to be always in action from the con- stant necessity of that function, which is usually performed twenty times in a minute; but yet a person has the power of rendering respiration quicker or slower at muU : and, further, in difficult breathing, many of the muscles destined under common circumstances to move the upper extremities, exert an involuntary power to assist the respiratory organs. There are, indeed, such distinguishing marks, both in the construction and function of these three classes of muscles, that it becomes necessary separately to describe them, so that they may be divided by the anatomist, as well as by the physiologist, into distinct classes. I The Involuntary Muscles. The involuntary, or, as sometimes termed, the internal muscles, are those which belong to vegetative life: they bear separately no particular names, but are denominated according to the organ of which they each form a part. To this class belong the muscles of the heart, of the alimentary canal, of the uterus, of the urinary organs ; and probably also the fibrous structure of the iris and trachea, which some have regarded as muscular and referred to this class, but it has yet to be proved that these fibres are actually muscular. The muscles of this class are deeply seated, and may be easily distinguished from the voluntary muscles. They are much less bulky, and form hollow cylinders, the internal surface of which is lined by a mucus membrane. Their fibres are of a greyish yellow colour, excepting those of the heart, which are of a deep red 5 and, unlike the voluntary muscles, they are not furnished with tendinous attachments;

THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 301 well iidiiptod to the functions it has to perform, as it unites in itself the three different physical properties of elasticity, Jlexi- bility, and strength; thus possessing- those qualities which render it best calculated to support weight, and to defend its important contents. The great elasticity of the spine is owing to a soft, elastic, intervertebral substance, which is found between each two of the twenty-four vertebras. But it is not the elasticity alone of this substance, which so admirably adapts it to the performance of its office, but also a gelatinous, almost fluid, central structure, which, being but little compressible during the erect position of the body, does not yield in the same degree as the' circumference of this fibro-cartilaginous tissue, and thereby admits of the twisting of the spine as if on a pivot. The form of the spine, which when viewed laterally re- sembles an italic S, also offers great advantages, by being able to yield in the direction of its curves, and thus admit the operation of its elasticity without a jerk, so that no jar or concussion is communicated to the brain during the more violent motions of the body. The curved form of the spine is also essentially service- able : in the first place, from the manner in which it is arti- culated with the occiput, posteriorly to the centre of gravity of the skull; for if the spine proceeded in a straight direction towards the pelvis, it would have to bear the weight under great disadvantages; but by the curve the cervical portion of the spine takes forward, it is brought in the axis of the weight, and thus diminishes the necessity for constant mus- cular action to keep the head erect; whilst this position of the cervical vertebrae is further useful from inclination for- wards, in sustaining the pharynx and larynx. In the next place, the dorsal vertebrae curve backwards, so as to enlarge the posterior dimensions of the thorax : the full extent of the convexity of this part of the spine backwards, is brought to a line perpendicular to the attachment of the atlas with the occiput. From thence the lower dorsal vertebrae pass slightly forwards and downwards to be connected with the lumbar.

GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 23 no trace of which structure is to be found excepting- in the heart. The directions of fibres in this class are various, being- disposed in layers, which are obliquely intersecting each other, so as to produce by their contraction a di- minished capacity of the cavity of which they form the parietes. The involuntary muscles are not furnished with antagonists ; but when they contract by tending- to diminish the size of the cylinders which they form, they are pressed against the substances contained within them, which may, indeed, be said in some measure to antagonize them. The involuntary muscles sometimes, by their contraction, produce a simultaneous action of the external and mixed class of muscles, which thus assist them in the performance of their functions, as in sneezing, coughing, and vomiting. The blood-vessels of this class of muscles are said to be very numerous; but it does not seem that they are distri- buting themselves so much to the muscles as to their lining membrane; and therefore it is doubtful if it be right to describe them according to the usual mode, as receiving more blood than the class of voluntary muscles. The involuntary muscles derive their nerves principally from the sympathetic, but also a few from the nerves of the spinal marrow ; and these nerves are stimulated, or, in other words, the irritability of these muscles is manifested by some local stimulus acting upon their fibres through the medium of the membrane which covers them ; so that their action may be said to be independent of the will, although it must at the same time be granted, that strong emotions of the mind do produce an involuntary influence on their action. It would appear that the involuntary muscles are more excitable, and are sooner put into action upon the application of a stimulus, than the voluntary ones; thus it is not uncommon to find the whole intestinal canal excited by the introduction of a foreign body, as a suppository into the rectum ; and this action is said to be produced by sympathy; which is, in fact, a term evincing their extreme excitability.

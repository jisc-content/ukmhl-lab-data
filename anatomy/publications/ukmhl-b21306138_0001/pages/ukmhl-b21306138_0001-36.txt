Without going* into detail respecting them, we may observe, that these sensa- tions are conveyed through the respective nerves to the sen- soiium, the brain. But this organ is endowed with other faculties, which cannot now require' to be enumerated: our present purpose is to particularize volition, by which it ope- rates instantaneously through the different nerves, on such parts or organs of the body as are subject to the influence or control of this faculty. We may add, that it operates simultaneously on parts which are distinct and remote from each other; as when a lady sings from written music, and flays an accompaniment on the harp. The g-rand distinc- tion between sensation and volition appears to be this:â€” sensation commences at the extremity of the nerves, and passes to the brain; while volition originates in the brain, and passes through the nerves to the limbs and other parts of the body that are susceptible of voluntary action, and are naturally actuated according to the purpose which the mind has willed to achieve. I would not here be under- stood to trench on the province of the moral philosopher, but to consider these phenomena in a strictly physiological point of view; I speak, therefore, of volition as a faculty participated by other animals in common with man. The sensation of hunger urg*es the lion to prowl for prey: the same sensation impels the savage of the woods, the mere animal man, to dig the earth for roots, or to slay the beasts of the field. The difference between man and the noblest of the inferior tribes of animals, consist, as I have already observed, in that reason, which, ever progressive, develops new resources for supplying his wants; and, as civilization advances, brings into clearer light those immutable princi- ples of equity, which, tempered by the social virtues, con- stitute that bond of union among all families, communities and nations of the earth, universally recognized, in its most extended and exalted sense, by the honourable name of Immamty. Having noticed the two great qualifications of sensation

LECTURE I. PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES. Xhe osseous system consists of those hardest parts of the human body, which, when arrangâ€™ed in their proper order, and connected by their natural ligaments, are well calculated to support the soft parts attached to them; and, indeed, to constitute a framework by w'hich the machine may be managed when in active motion, and sustained when qui- escent. All the bones, excepting the teeth, are more or less deeply seated; each being surrounded by soft parts, and presenting no exterior surface. They are covered by the muscles and integuments, w hich adapt them for the support of the arterial and nervous systems, and for the due formation of joints. The number of bones is considerable; amounting, at the adult period of life, to two hundred and forty-one ; but they vary aceording to age. Many of the bones which are single when ossification is completed, during infancy are separable into many parts. The size of the different bones varies considerably: some of them are found to measure nearly a fourth of the whole length of the body, while others are but a small portion of an inch in extent; and from this difference in their size some anatomists have classed them. Bones are also divided into portions as regards their indi- vidual extent: thus the bones that exist singly are said to consist of a body or centre, and of two sides, joined by an imaginary middle line, which divides them into symmetrical halves. Again, some bones are distinguished into parts according to the uses which those parts serve: thus the os frontis is divided into the orbital and nasal processes.

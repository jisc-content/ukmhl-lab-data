278 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, the knee-joint. This accident was first observed by Mr, Hey, of Leeds, and the symptoms have been most perspicuously and scientifically des- cribed by him, in his “ Practical Observations on .Surgery.” In few cases of dislocation of the tibia is there much difficulty in returning the bone to its situation, by reason of the laceration of the ligaments; but great care is required to relax the muscles inserted into it, that their action may not again displace the bone. This object is best efiected by bandages, and by the semiflexed position of the limb. The constitutional remedies will, necessarily, be directed by the pecu- liarities of each particular case. Articulation of the Tibia and Fibula. Class Diarthrosis.—Subdivision Arthrodia. These two bones are in close contact at each extremity; but in the intermediate space there is a natural separation between them, which is filled up by the interosseous lig'a- ment. In this respect they are similar to the bones of the fore arm, excepting- that they are comparatively firmly fixed to each other, while a very considerable degree of motion is allowed between the radius and the ulna. Uppe^' Fibulo Tibial Articulation. There is a depression on the outer side of the head of the tibia, and a corresponding surface on the fibula, for the attachment of these two bones; each is covered with car- tilage and synovial membrane, and their union is strengthened by an anterior and posterior ligament. The anterior ligament is of considerable strength and size. It passes from the outer part of the tubercle of the tibia out- wards and downwards, to be attached to the head of the fibula, and is covered and rendered stronger by the tendon of the biceps muscle. The posterior ligament takes a very similar course to the I

Thus we may ob- serve, that, during the performance of flexion and extension of the fore arm, the rotatory motion of the superior radio ulnar articulation may be continued as a separate and dis- tinct action; proving, that, although the action relative to the elbow-joint is simultaneous, the function is for the distinct motion of a separate joint. And further, we may observe, that the principal strength of structure is main- tained between the humerus and ulna, which are placed in a continued line with each other ; while the radius diverges outwards from the elbow-joint to be connected with the carpus, and thus increases the range of motion of the hand. The biceps muscle being attached to the radius, and not as the other three to the ulna, may be considered in its action for the purpose of drawing the head of the radius firmly upon the external condyle of the humerus, when powerful supination is required; and it is remarkable that the radius does not diverge from the ulna, until after the attachment of the biceps; by which construction, this point of insertion is placed in the line of direction in w^hich the radius and ulna are capable of affording the greatest resistance. From these circumstances, the bra- chialis internus may be considered as the true flexor of the elbow; but when the radio ulnar articulation is in a state of supination, then the biceps is capable of acting, and adding considerable strength to the power of flexion. There are, however, several other muscles called into action, to maintain the elbow in a state of flexion ; and these actions are variously modified according to the corresponding changes of exertions in the position of the limb. These muscles are the supinator radii longus, the flexor carpi radialis, the flexor carpi ulnaris, the palmaris longus, and pronator radii teres. The extension of the elbow is produced by two muscles,

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 215 it g'ains the os calcis, the tendon of the peroneus brevis is above and anterior to it. Use.—To extend the ancle-joint as the preceding' muscle. The tendons of the preceding- muscles, as they pass through the grooves behind the malleoli, are tied down by strong- tendinous sheaths, lubricated with synovia; the annular ligament, in a like manner, and for a similar purpose, pro- ceeds from one malleolus across to the other, in front of the inferior extremities of the tibia and fibula ; being connected to the projections on the surface of the bones. All the muscles proper to the toes, and some of those common to them, are attached entirely to the bones of the foot, and are by most anatomists classified as the proper muscles of the foot; whereas those of the ancle-joint, which move the foot, are, properly speaking, to be considered as belonging- to that division of the lower extremity. Before these muscles can be dissected, the skin and fascia plantaris must be removed. Of the skin, it may be observed, that it is here thicker than in any other part of the body, in consequence of the constant pressure to which it is exposed ; underneath it there is always found a considerable quantity of fat, which furnishes a soft cushion, and prevents the ill effects which would otherwise arise from the concussion and bruising to which the soft parts underneath are liable. On removing the skin, (which is a task of some dif- ficulty, from the firm manner in which it adheres to the subjacent aponeurosis, by fibres of short and dense cellular membrane). The fascia plantaris—is exposed; it arises from the anterior part of the under surface of the tuberosity of the os calcis, and appears as if it were a continuation of the tendo Achillis, commencing by a thick narrow strip, which proceeds forwards along the under surface of the foot, be- coming broader and thinner as it approaches the toes, and terminates, being attached by distinct portions to the an- terior extremities of the metatarsal bones; each portion p 2

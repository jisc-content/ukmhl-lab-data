289 OKNERAr, ANATOMY OK THE SKIN. org’an of touch, we have already partly considered with the structure particularly destined for this sensation ; we may, however, further remark, that although this sense has a g-reater power in particular situations, its general distribution in every part of the skin, is of the utmost importance as a source of protection, by the information which it communi- cates in cases of danger: this is evinced by the sudden and universal sensation occasioned by the slightest touch of such objects as, from their nature, arc considered hurtful to the human body. Morbid sensibility of touch, in some indi- viduals, e.xists to a very great extent upon the contact of certain objects, which are to others perfectly innoxious ; such I have known to be the case in a sensation communicated from the skin of the cat, of a peach, and the leaves of such plants as have minute hairs. The principal function of the skin, is the important secre- tion of perspiration, which, in a healthy individual, is con- stantly going on insensibly, in a state of vapour; but when this secretion is accelerated by violent muscular exertion, accompanied by quickened respiration, the perspiration is poured out in the visible form of sweat. This answers a very important purpose, by preserving the temperature of the body, which otherwise would be so greatly increased by muscular exertion, as to produce the most painful effects. The great power which the perspiration has in reducing the temperature of the body, is witnessed by the high degree of heat which glass-blow^ers, and men in iron foundries, are capable of sustaining; and in all such instances, perspira- tion flows in streams from the surface of the skin. Dr. Fordyce, and Dr. Blagden, made experiments to ascertain what was the degree of heat the body was capable of bearing; in these experiments, it was found that, in a room heated to the temperature of 264° of Farenheit’s thermo- meter, respiration could be carried on without any particular distress after perspiration had broken out upon the skin. In these experiments, we must remark the effect pro- duced by perspiration in preventing the increase of the heat u

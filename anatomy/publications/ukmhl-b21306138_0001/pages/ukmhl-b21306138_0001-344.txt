282 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. inserted into the upper part of the os caleis; its external sur- face is covered by the tendons of the peronei muscles ; inter- nally, it is lined by synovial membrane. The anterior ligament of the fibula arises from the anterior part of the external malleolus, and passes downwards and inwards to be attached to the fore part of the astragalus. llie posterior ligament of the fibula takes much the same course as the preceding ligament, but is situated behind the joint; it passes from the back part of the malleolus externus, and is inserted at the posterior part of the astragalus, into the outer edge of the groove which lodges the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis muscle. This ligament sometimes is divided into two fasciculi, the upper one being its origin from the fibula, connected with the posterior ligament of the in- ferior tibio fibular articulation. Synovial membrane.—This membrane secretes a larger quantity of synovia than any in the body. It extends from the cartilaginous surfaces of the tibia and fibula upwards, between these two bones, as high as the inferior tibio fibular articulation. It then prolongs itself on the cartilaginous surfaces of the two malleoli, covers all the ligaments of the ancle-joint, and rises upon the articulatory surfaces of the astragalus; before and behind it is very lax, and is connected with a considerable quantity of adipose membranes. Motions of the Ancle-Joint. / The foot, through the medium of the ancle-joint, has the motions of flexion, extension, and lateral inclination. Flexion.—During this motion the astragalus passes from before backwards, within the cavity formed by the tibia and fibula. The anterior ligaments are relaxed, and the posterior are put upon the stretch ; but the lateral remain much in their natural state. Extension.—In this action the foot is carried from the right angle with the leg, so as to form an obtuse angle; the

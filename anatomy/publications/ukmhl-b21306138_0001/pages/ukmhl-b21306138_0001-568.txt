DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 182 Wlien the deep fascia of the perinaeum is removed, the whole extent of— The wt. levator ani—is exposed. This muscle arises fleshy from the posterior part of the symphisis pubis, by thin tendinous fibres from the obturator fascia, beginning at the upper edge of the obturator foramen, reaching backwards along the ihum and ischium, as far as the spinous process of that bone; from these origins the fibres radiate, passing downwards and inwards towards the lower opening of the pelvis to be inserted into a tendinous raphe, formed by the union of the two muscles, which extends from the os coc- cygis to the anterior extremity of the rectum. The anterior, or pubic portion of this muscle, surrounds the membranous portion of the urethra; and these fibres being somewhat distinct from the rest of the fibres of the levator ani, have been described by Mr. Wilson as a distinct muscle, under the name of the compressor urethra;; but they are too intimately connected with the levator ani to warrant their description as a separate muscle. This muscle is of a funnel-like form, arising from the inner parietes of the pelvis, and descending, its fibres con- verge towards its fellow of the opposite side, principally filling up the lower opening of the pelvis; it lies between two layers of the deep perinseal fascia, the innermost of which separates this muscle from the rectum, membranous part of the urethra, prostate gland, and vesiculae seminales ; posteriorly it is in contact with the coccygeus muscle. Its anterior termination lies between the sphincter ani and the longitudinal muscular fibres of the rectum, forming some few circular fibres around the verge of the anus, w'hich have been termed the internal sphincter. Use.—To raise the rectum, and to draw it backwards towards the pelvis, when it has been protruded in the expulsion of the faeces; it also assists in propelling the urine and sendnal fluid ; and tlie anterior fibres which surround the membranous part of tlie urethra, perhaps, upon some occasions, act as a sphincter.

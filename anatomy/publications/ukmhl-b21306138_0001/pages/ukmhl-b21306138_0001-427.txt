descriptive anatomy of muscles. 41 into the scapula. There is now only left for him to study the direction of the fibres of each muscle; and their indivi- dual action is rendered apparent by the knowledge, that a muscle, when contracting, must of necessity draw the more moveable point towards the more fixed one, in a direction precisely opposite to that of the fibres of the muscle in action. The muscles of the shoulder and elbow-joints admit of equal facility of dissection according to their uses, as they are not concealed by the muscles of any other arti- culation; but those of the radio-ulnar joints and of the wrist and the fingers, are more complicated in consequence of their being so connected with each other as scarcely to admit of their being dissected in the order of the joints to which they belong, but require to be arranged in layers as they pre- sent themselves to view in the prog’ress of their dissection: thus it may be premised, that the muscles situated between the radius and ulna, both anteriorly and posteriorly, belong in part to the radio-ulnar, wrist, and articulations of the fin- gers. Those situated in front are eight in number: they principally arise from the internal condyle of the humerus, and are disposed in two layers, five being placed superficially, and three of them deeply seated: and in the same manner the eleven muscles filling up the spacei between the radius and ulna behind, are forming two layers—six of them being- superficial, whilst five are deeply seated: the muscles in the superficial layer principally arise from the external condyle of the os humeri. Muscles situated on the hand are also placed so as to preclude the possibility of dissecting- them so as to expose them in order, according to their uses: but they may be readily understood by the following classifi- cation : the first muscle seen upon removing the skin from the palm of the hand is the palmaris brevis—a muscle proper to the skin and fascia of the hand; and on removing this muscle, with the palmar fascia on the outer side of the hand, the muscles proper to the thumb are exposed; and on the inner side, those of the little finger; while in the centre, there are superficially placed, the tendons of the flexor sublimis

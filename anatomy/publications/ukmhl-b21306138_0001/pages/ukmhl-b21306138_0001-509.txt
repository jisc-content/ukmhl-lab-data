DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 123 arm ; it covers posteriorly the flexor digitorum perforans, the ulna artery and nerve,and the pronator quadratus muscle; its outer edge, at its origin, is united to the flexor perforatus; but as they descend they separate; and between them, or on the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris, is situated the ulna artery and nerve. Use.—To flex the wrist-joint, and to direct the liand slightly in- wards. These five superficial muscles should now be cut through and reflected, to expose the three deeper seated; which comprise the flexor digitorum profundus vel perforans, common to the fingers; the flexor longus pollicis, proper to the thumb; and the pronator quadratus, a muscle of the radio-ulnar articulations. The m. flexor digitorum profundus vel perforans,—This muscle arises, tendinous and fleshy, from the inner side of the upper extremity of the ulna, between the coronoid process and olecranon, from the root of the coronoid process surround- ing the insertion of the brachialis internus muscle, from three superior fourths of the anterior surface of the ulna, reaching as far down as the attachment of the pronator quadratus, from the radial side of the ulna, and inner half of the in- terosseous ligament: it forms a strong fleshy muscle, termi- nating in four tendons, which pass under the annular liga- ment, where they are confined by surrounding cellular membrane. From this point they separate in the palm of the hand, and pass to the ligamentous sheaths of the fingers, perforating the tendons of the superficial flexors, to reach their insertions into the last phalanx of each finger. This muscle is covered anteriorly by the flexor sublimis and flexor carpi ulnaris, the ulnar and median nerve, and the ulnar artery ; it lies upon the fore and inner surfaces of the ulna, the interosseous ligament and vessels, the pronator quadratus, and the carpus and metacarpus. Tlie tendons of the flexor profundus and sublimis digi- torum are confined in a peculiar tendinous sheath, given off from the anterior surface of the phalanges, and forming

54 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. The Anatomy of Hernia. In the dissection of the abdominal muscles and fasciae, all the parts connected with ing-uinal hernias are exposed, and should be most minutely examined in the following order. The skin and superficial fascia being removed from the lower part of the abdomen, the, aponeurotic expansion, or tendinous insertion of the external oblique muscle, is to be observed passing by a distinct free edge obliquely down- wards and inwards from the ilium to the pubesâ€™; and within an inch of that bone it splits into two pillars, so as to form an opening called the external abdominal ring ; which is described usually as being of a triangular'form, the pubes constituting the base of the triangle, and the point of sepa- ration of the tendons the apex: but if the external angle of the ring be examined carefully, it will not be found pointed, in consequence of some transverse fibres which pass from one pillar to the other, thus rounding it off so as, in fact, to make this the large part of the opening, the size of which varies much in difierent individuals; sometimes forming such an aperture as just to allow of the passage of the cord, and in other instances producing a considerable separation. The external ring, however, is not to be considered as a distinct opening; for, from the edges of the pillars, a thin fascia proceeds along the cord, giving a covering* to it so as to form a prolongation like the finger of a glove : and besides this, the fascia superficialis also tends to close it; and both these fasciae must therefore be cut away before the pillars of the external ring can be brought into view. The dissection of the parts of hernia is further prosecuted by making an incision through the tendon of the external oblique, be- ginning an inch above the external ring, and carrying it outwards to the ilium ; then separating the edges of the cut tendon, the parts underneath are exposed, and imme- diately the cord in the male subject, and the round ligament in the female, will present itself to view, taking a course

Each of the metacarpal bones is furnished with as many fasciculi of palmar and dorsal ligaments, as it has attachments to bones of the carpus; for instance, the metacarpal bone of the fore finger has a fasciculus from the trapezium, trapezoid, and os magnum. Articulation of the Bones of the Metacarpus with each other. The metacarpal bone of the thumb is not connected with any other of the metacarpal bones. The rest are in actual contact posteriorly, and are furnished with small synovial capsules ; and these articulations are strengthened by dorsal and palmar ligaments, which pass transversely from one bone to the other, forming rather one continuous surface than being separable into three distinct fasciculi, as generally des- cribed. The inferior extremities of these bones diverge, but are connected by transverse ligaments, which are divided into two sets of fibres, a superficial, and a deep: the latter are the shorter, and exclusively deserve the name of intertrans- verse, passing from one bone to the other; their anterior faces are crossed by four depressions, which answer to the passage of the tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers, and the lumbricales. Posteriorly, they are connected wth the tendons of the interosseous muscles, and with the liga- ments connecting the phalanges with the metacarpus. The superficial fibres pass across all the metacarpal bones, e.x- cepting that of the thumb, both on the dorsal and palmar regions. Articulation of the Metacarpus with the Phalanges.

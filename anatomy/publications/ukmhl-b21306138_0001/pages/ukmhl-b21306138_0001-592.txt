200 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. rom the intimate connection of these muscles with those of the toes, and from their situation being" in common, the same difficulty occurs which we had to contend with, in the dissection of the muscles of the fore arm. Instead, therefore, of following" their dissection strictly according" to their function, we shall describe them in the following" order, which is consistent with their natural situa- tion ; namely, those which are posterior to the tibia and fibula, those which are anterior, and those situated on the outer side. The posterior muscles are six in number, which are divided into a superficial and deep-seated layer; the superficial layer consists of three muscles belong"ing" to the ancle-joint; the deep-seated layer is also composed of three muscles, of which, one belong"s to the ancle-joint, one common to the toes, and one proper to the great toe. The anterior muscles are three in number ; one of which belongs to the ancle-joint, one common to the toes, and one proper to the great toe ; in this region also is found the peroneus tertius, which, when described separately, is also a muscle of the ancle-joint. The external muscles are two in number; both of them belonging to the ancle-joint. The superficial layer of the posterior muscles, consist of the gastrocnemius, plantaris, and solaeus; which, being inserted by a common tendon, are, by some anatomists, termed the triceps extensor pedis. The m. gastrocnemiusâ€”arises by two distinct tendinous origins; one from each condyle of the femur, the inner one being larger, and descending lower than the outer; they converge as they pass downwards, and soon unite, where they form a common aponeurosis, from wffiich the fleshy fibres of the muscle arise, and form a strong fleshy belly, which terminates a little below the middle of the tibia in a broad flat tendon, which is common to it and the solaeus, and is termed the tendo Achillis; inserted into the back part of the tuberosity of the os calcis; sliding over the

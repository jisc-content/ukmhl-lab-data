70 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. backwards, and lastly, downwards, to terminate at the stylo- mastoid foramen. In its course, being" termed the canal of Fallopius, it transmits the portio dura, or facial nerve. The two other foramina, which are very small, are for the purpose of allowing the evacuation of fluid from the cochlea and vestibule of the internal ear, and are named the aquar- ductus cochlea et vestibuli. It is usual to give a particular description of the external as well as of the internal base of the skull; but I consider that the manner in which I have traced the foramina from the interior to their external openings, wdll sufficiently com- bine the description of both surfaces. Important Cavities produced by the Bones of the Face. The Orbits Are two large cavities, situated on either side of the nose, immediately below the superciliary ridges. They are of a conical form ; their base being in front, and the apex behind. Their direction is from behind to before, and somewhat from wdthin to without; which circumstance tends much to enlarge the field of vision : but this advantage, perhaps, may be con- sidered as secured by the cavity of the bony orbit being much larger than the ball of the eye itself. Each orbit is composed of seven bones, although but eleven enter into the composition of the two; which apparent para- dox is explained by three of the bones being common to the two orbits, viz.:—the frontal, the ethmoid, and the sphenoid. The relative position of these bones, in the composition of each orbit, is as follows :—The os frontis is situated above, and forms the whole of the roof of tlie cavity: the floor is produced by the orbitar process of tire superior maxillary- bone. The malar and sphenoid bones constitute the outer w^all: the inner wall receives the unguis and ethmoid bones: and lastly, the palate bone completes the small pos- terior part, or apex of the orbit. In each orbit are found

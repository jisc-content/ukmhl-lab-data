DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 221 the transverse process of each dorsal vertebra, and passes outwards to be inserted into the neck, reaching- as far as the ang-Ie of each rib. These lig-anaents gradually increase in size as far as the ninth rib, which is the longest from its tubercle to its angle, and is composed of fasciculi of great strength. With regard to the twelfth rib, the ligament passes obliquely dowmwards, to be inserted into its body; serving, by tliis attachment, to connect it with the transverse process of the vertebra; indeed, they are connected solely by this medium, having no articulatory surface in contact. The icse of this ligament is to prevent the rib from being thrust forcibly forwards from the transverse processes of the vertebrae. Connexion of the Neck of the Ribs with the Articular and Transverse Processes. The external ligament of the neck of the rib arises from the external surface of the inferior articular process of the vertebra above, and from the root of the transverse process. Between these two origins is a space for the passage of some posterior nerves from the intercostals; it then passes downw ards, to be inserted into the upper part of the neck of the rib below. It prevents the neck of the rib from being elevated by the action of the intercostal muscles, but allows the head to turn in its capsule, so as to admit of die eleva- tion of the body of the rib in inspiration. The internal ligament of the neck of the rib arises from the anterior surface of the transverse process of the next superior vertebra, and passes downwards to be inserted into the fore part of the neck of the rib immediately below; it is attached, therefore, in a very similar manner to that of the external ligament of the neck of the rib, excepting that it is situated anteriorly, and its fibres pass somewhat more inwards, so as to decussate with those of the external ligament.

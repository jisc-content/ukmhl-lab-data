GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN, 295 face in the wound ; for if the cellular membrane is left, or reg-enerated, so as to -cover the muscles and subjacent structures, then new skin can form on any part of the wound, although it will always g-enerate quicker at the edges of the old skin ; hence the use of approximating them during the healing of a large ulcer. Bandaging also assists in the reproduction of skin, by subjecting the cellular membrane to its natural pressure. The similarity of structure between the cutis and the mucous membranes, is rendered very obvious, both in dis- ease and in reproduction. As has been remarked, newly- formed cutis, just before it becomes covered by the cuticle, has all the appearance of mucous membrane; and mucous membranes themselves, when exposed to the atmosphere, and being no longer capable of performing their natural functions, become covered with cuticle; this I have fre- quently seen in prolapsus ani; and Dr. Blundell told me of a case of procedentia vaginae, where the protruded mucous membrane was not only covered with cuticle ; but that a rete raucosum was also found, giving to the part the colour of the skin of the scrotum and prepuce. In extensive burns, also, where a diseased action is set up, and cuticle is not reproduced, the cutis not only has the appearance, but also more or less the function of mucous membranes, lubri- cating its surface with a muco purulent secretion. The skin is also the original seat of disease, arising* from the obliteration of the excretory canal of the sebaceous fol- licles; from which circumstance, accumulations of the se- cretion will frequently occur, forming what are termed, when they acquire large size, an encysted tumour: not that I be- lieve encysted tumours are always so produced ; for, in some instances, the cyst as well as the secretion seems entirely adventitious. In these follicular tumours, when small, the secretion may usually be pressed out of the duct, the situation of its opening being apparent, from a little dark spot produced by the exposure of its secretion to the air: and when they have acquired even the size of a walnut, u 2

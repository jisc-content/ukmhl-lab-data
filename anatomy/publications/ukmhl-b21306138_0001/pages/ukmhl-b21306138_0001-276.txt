214 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. Laterally they intermix with the tendinous origin of the tra- pezius and latissimus dorsi muscles. These ligaments are sometimes described as occupying a considerable portion of the bodies as well as the apices of the spinous processes ; but it appears that the structure in that situation is merely the tendinous origin of muscle. In the dorsal vertebrae there are some fibres of ligamentous appearance, situated between the transverse processes, which have been called intertransverse ligaments, but which do not deserve such a classification, as they seem rather to be the origin of the levatores costarum and multifidae spines than proper ligaments. The Peculiar Articulations of the Vertebrae. Articulation of the Head with the Vertebral Column. Class Diarthrosis.—Subdivision Arthrodia. This articulation forms a double arthrodial joint, produced by the condyloid processes of the occiput being received into the articular surfaces of the atlas; both of which are covered with cartilage and synovial membrane, and are connected by the following ligaments, which retain them firmly in their situation. The anterior portion of the circular ligament is attached above to the fore part of the foramen magnum, and extends itself to the anterior extremities of the condyloid processes ; it thence passes down and is inserted into the fore part of the arch of the atlas, becoming there continuous with the com- mon anterior vertebral ligaments, and also into the edges of the articular surfaces of that bone. Posterior portion of the circular ligament.—This liga- ment is much larger than the anterior; it arises from the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, extending itself laterally as far as the capsular ligament, connecting the occiput with the atlas, and then passes down to be inserted

GENERAL ANATOMY OE THE SKIN. 2d2 of a thicker consistency, and more of a ceruminous nature, vvliich appears also to be for the purpose of protecting’ the skin from the irritation of its own accumulated secretions. From the foreg’oing’ considerations of the many important functions performed by the skin in its various secretions, we have a strong- proof of the necessity both of air and exercise to maintain the healthy state of the body ; and for the same reason, indolence of habit, and the various indulg-ences which luxury resorts to, are so many means which contribute to an unhealthy state of the system. This is proved by the sym- pathy which exists between the functions of the skin, and those of other parts: and such a reciprocity of action takes place between them, that the health of one depends upon the natural action of the others. Considerable doubts have been entertained respecting- the absorbent power of the skin ; it has however been pretty clearly proved, that, althoug-h incapable of absorbing- fluids, g-azeous substances may by this process be taken into the system. The fact of chlorine depriving- the rete mucosum of colour in the Negro, proves the existence of cutaneous absorption. Sir Astley Cooper, who has paid much atten- tion to this subject, seems inclined to believe that the cuticle offers a strong resistance to absorption; and that unless it is abraded, by friction or otherwise, cutaneous absorption does not take place. Those who are of a different opinion, instance the urine becoming tainted when the hand has been immersed in turpentine; but by numerous experiments, it has been proved, that this effect does not take place, unless the vapour arising from the turpentine has, at the same time, been inspired: and again, that persons jumping into cold water in a state of extreme thirst; being relieved from this situation, is not to be considered as depending- upon the absorption of the fluid, but upon the effect of cold; which, under all circumstances, lessens the sensation of thirst. The development of the skin commences at a very early period after conception ; in the embryo, it is first discover- able about the fifth month, when it is of a rosy tint; the

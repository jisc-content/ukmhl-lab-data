DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 05 under Poupart's lig-ament, is contig-uous with the femoral vein, it becomes immediately received into, or, more pro- perly, forms for itself a distinct cavity, derived from the sheath which it dilates before it. The covering- which a hernia thus acquires, is frequently denominated the fascia propria. The first external appearance indicating- the presence of an incipient femoral hernia, is that of a tumour situated immediately below and rather to the outer side of the spinous process of the pubis, becoming-, in its prog-ress, larg-er and more superficial as it rises throug-h the opening- of the fascia lata. Its covering-s will be found to be three in number, exclusive of the peritoneal sac: these are, first, the common integ-uments; and under it the superficial apo- neurosis, probably involving- one or more of the ing’uinal glands; on removing this we discover the third tunic, or fascia propria, which is always loaded, and consequently obscured, by more or less adipose structure. On dividing this last covering, the peritoneal sac will be brought into view. A crural hernia, however, does not always occupy the situation which has been described; for, as it increases in size by the successive escape of fresh portions of viscera, it will be found to take a direction upwards, turning over Poupart’s ligament, and resting on the tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The explanation of this apparently unnatural course, appears to consist in the firmness with which the superficial aponeurosis adheres to the crescentic edge of the fascia lata, together with the pre- sence of the absorbent glands, whereby the hernia is pre- vented from descending into the thigh: while, at the same time, the looseness of the cellular tissue covering Poupart’s ligament offers little mechanical resistance to its passage in that direction. The situation assumed by a hernia is of the utmost im- portance : since the principles by which we attempt its reduction are founded upon a knowledge of the course which it pursues. F

21 BONES OF THE HEAD. the mezian line of the body; wliile the parietal and tem- poral bones are in pairs, and are situated laterally. The bones of the head are connected with each other by sutures, of which I shall now g-ive no further account than their name and situation, leaving' their minute anatomical structure to be described under articulations in general. The Sutures. The principal sutures are the coronal, the sagittal, lamboi- dal, and two squamous; and of inferior importance, at least in a pathological view, we may mention the transverse eth-- moidal and sphenoidal sutures. These sutures connect the bones of the skull in the following manner. The coronal suture connects the frontal with the tw^o pa- rietal bones: it begins at the anterior junction of the parietal bones, and extending downwards on each side, terminates in the squamous suture about an inch behind the external angle of the orbit. The sagittal suture connects the two parietal bones in the middle line of the vertex, extending from the coronal suture before to the lambdoidal behind. The lambdoidal suture commences at the posterior junc- tion of the two parietal bones, connecting them with the os occipitis: it extends itself downwards on each side, as far as the posterior boundary of the squamous suture, and there seems to terminate; although a prolongation of this suture serves to connect the remaining portion of the occipital with the temporal bones, under the name of the additamentum suturro lambdoidalis. The squamous sutures, so called from one bone overlap- ping the other, extend from the coronal suture before to the lambdoidal behind, uniting the temporal with the parietal bones. A continuation of this suture, uniting the temporal with the sphenoid bone, is termed, by some anatomists, the additamentum suturm squamosaj J but it should be observed that this overlapping of bones is not peculiar to the temporal c 2 \

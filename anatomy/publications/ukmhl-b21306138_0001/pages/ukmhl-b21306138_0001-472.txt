80 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. is composed of two fleshy portions: the posterior belly arises, broad and thick, from a depression on the inner side of the mastoid process of the temporal bone ; it passes downwards and inwards towards the os hyoides, becoming' thinner as it descends; and as it approaches that bone, it forms a small rounded tendon, which passes through the fibres of the stylo hyoideus muscle, and then becomes fixed to the os hy- oides by a process of aponeurosis, which is given off from the tendon. From this point the anterior belly may be said to commence, which ascends, passing at the same time for- wards and inwards, and becoming broader as it approaches the lower jaw, passes to be inserted by aponeurotic fibres into a fossa situated by the side of the symphysis. The posterior portion of this muscle is partly covered by the three muscles which are inserted into the mastoid process of the temporal bone: namely, the sterno cleido mastoideus, trachelo mastoideus, and splenius; and the remaining part by the platysma myoides. It covers the three muscles arising from the styloid process of the temporal bone, crosses the carotid vessels, internal jugular vein, lingual nerve, hyo glossus, and mylo hyoideus muscles; and in the triangle formed by the two bellies of this muscle and the base of the lower jaw, the submaxillary gland is placed. —AVhen both the bellies of this muscle act, the os hyoides being fixed, the lower jaw is depressed, and the mouth opened; if the an- terior helly alone acts, it is for the purpose either of raising the os hyoides, and carrying it forwards, or for depressing the lower jaw, according with the bone that offers the fixed point for the action of the muscle ; if the posterior helly alone acts, it either draws the os hyoides backwards, or, if that bone he fixed, it assists in raising the upper jaw, by drawing the head backwards. The m. mylo hyoideus.—This muscle arises, by short ten- dinous fibres, from a line placed on the inner side of the lower jaw, extending from the last molar tooth to the centre of the inner surface of the symphysis, where the muscle meets with its fellow on the opposite side, and they, unite sometimes fleshy, and at others by a small tendinous rapha ; it then passes downwards and backwards to be inserted ten-

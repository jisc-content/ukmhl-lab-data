articulations of the lower extremities. 281 astragalus with the tibia and fibula much more secure, as well as in connecting those bones firmly together. Articulation of the Astragalus with the Tibia and Fibula, or Ancle-Joint. Class Diarthrosis.â€”Subdivision Arthrodia, The inferior extremities of the tibia and fibula form a socket for the reception of the upper part of the astragalus; this socket is rendered much deeper by the projection of the two malleoli on either side of the astragalus, and it is further completed by the anterior and posterior ligaments, which have just been described, connecting the tibia and fibula below. The surfaces of bone entering into this joint are covered by cartilage and synovial membrane, and are maintained in their situation by two ligaments from the tibia, and three from the fibula. The internal lateral, or deltoid ligament, is of a triangular form ; its apex is attached to the internal malleolus ; it then passes downwards, becoming broader as it descends, and is inserted into the inner side of the astragalus and os calcis; forming, where it is attached to the other bone, a sheath for the transmission of the tendons of the long flexors of the toes and the tibialis posticus, which pass behind the internal mal- leolus to be inserted. There is also an anterior ligament from the tibia, which passes from the fore part of this bone to be attached to the anterior surface of the astragalus; and from the manner in which this ligament is connected to the lateral ligaments by condensed cellular membrane, the ancle- joint is sometimes described as having a complete capsular ligament; the tendons of the extensor muscles of the toes pass over it. The external lateral, or middle perpendicular ligament of the fibula, is composed of straight fibres, which are strong, and rounded in their form, passing from the Inferior extremity of the malleolus externus perpendicularly downwards, to be

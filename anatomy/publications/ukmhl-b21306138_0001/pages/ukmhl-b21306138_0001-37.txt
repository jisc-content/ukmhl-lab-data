XXXV INTRODUCTOUY LECTURE. uiid of will, as peculiar to the nervous system in general, I may now efbservo, that the nerves are subjected to another kind of action, which in no degree obeys the control of the will, and which influences the involuntary functions of life. I'his influence operates through the agency of the sympa- thetic nerve; so called because it supplies, in common, those oro’ans of which the constant action is essential to D existence. This nerve is connected with the brain, as well as with the spinal marrow; and from their union may be solved the problem, why mental impressions are capable of affecting’ the involuntary and merely mechanical action of certain organs. Thus we may account for the acceleration in the beating’ of the heart, and in the peristaltic motions of the intestines, when the mind is actuated by fear or any other strong emotion.

In the brain reside intellectual conception, the offspring of sensorial impression : memory, including’ the power not only of remembering’, but of recollecting at will, events or facts which have once been known; imagination; or, the power of forming new combination ; and judgement; or, the faculty of comparing and distinguishing right from wrong, truth from falsehood, equity from injustice:—all these faculties, when cultivated and improved by proper exercise, serve to qualify and accomplish man as a social being; and to ele- vate him to that station, which his Creator intended him to attain; as the sovereign lord of that earth, which he*was authorized to replenish and to subdue. In concluding this outline of the course of study upon which you are about to enter, I would intreat your farther attention. Gentlemen, to some observations on the subject of those duties which you owe to yourselves, to your parents, and, I may add, to the community at large; for upon the faithful and zealous fulfilment of them, depends the question

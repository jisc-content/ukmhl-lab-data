GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. 279 more particularly where subjected to pressure, its thickness will be considerably increased, as on the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. The skin is connected with the parts underneath by means of cellular membrane, which is more or less abundant according to the extent of motion the subjacent parts are liable to. In this attachment, the skin of the body presents a mezian division by a line of closer and firmer texture, which extends along an imaginary vertical line, dividing the trunk into symmetrical halves; but which line, externally, is interrupted by the natural outlets of the body; although in fact, as has been men- tioned, it passes into these orifices to be connected with the mucous membranes. To the elasticity of the skin we are indebted, in a great measure, for the symmetry and form of the body; w'ere it not for this physical property, in every distortion, the skin would require some new vital action to restore it to its natural situation. In the extensive motions of the various joints of the body, the skin arranges itself into numerous wrinkles, corresponding precisely with the centre of motion of each joint; and where the skin is under the influence of muscles, the wrinkles will correspond with the direction of their contractions, as may be seen particularly on the fore- head, eyelids, neck, and other parts of the body. These wrinkles must not, however, be confounded with those of old age, which depend upon the general shrinking of the whole fabric. The surface of the skin presents numerous minute open- ings, of a rounded shape, which are the excretories of the sebaceous follicles ; these are very generally distributed, but are most abundant on the liose and face : there are also smaller openings, which are scarcely perceptible without the assistance of a microscope; these are the perspiratory pores: the skin is also penetrated by the hairs which pass through its substance. The color of the skin varies in different parts of the body; it is darker on the scrotum, perineum, upper part of the inside of the thighs, and in the T 2

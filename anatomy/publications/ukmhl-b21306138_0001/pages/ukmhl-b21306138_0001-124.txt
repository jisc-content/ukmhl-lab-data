80 THIS OSSEOUS SYSTEM, backwards and outwards; the inferior, forwards and in- wards: tlieir surfaces are flat. The spinous processes are long-, and pass with g-reat ob- liquity downwards. Their posterior surface presents a sharp ridg-e, to receive which there is g'enerally a g-roove on the under surface of the process above. The spinous processes of the dorsal vertebraj increase in length, and incline more downwards from the first till about the eig-hth, below which they become shorter and more horizontal, resembling those of the lumbar region. The 7iotches are large, and strongly marked at the lower edge: more slightly, above. There are in this region, as in the cervical, some distinguishing marks, by w'hich certain vertebrae of this class may be recognised: the first, tenth, eleventh and twelfth, are of this description. The first presents, on each side of its body, two articulating surfaces,â€”a whole one above for the first rib, and a half one below for the second. The tenth has a single half-articulatory surface only, on the upper edge of each side of its body, for the junction of the tenth rib. The eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae are alike 5 both having an entire articulatory surface on each side of their bodies for their respective ribs, and having none on their transverse processes: but they may be known from each other by the twelfth having its inferior articulatory surfaces directed outwards, and somewhat convex; resembling, therefore, in that respect, the lumbar vertebras. The grand distinguishing mark of the dorsal vertebrae is the articulating surfaces, for the attachment of the ribs. The Lumbar Vertebrae May be at once known from the rest by their greater size, and also, negatively, by not being furnished either with a foramen through their transverse processes, or . with articu- lating surfaces for the ribs. Their body bears a great

156 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM, it is of a triang’ular form, with the base situated above, and the apex below; being slightly concave from above to below. The posterior surface is the smallest and thinnest portion of the bone; it presents to the outer side of its centre a small tubercle, which gives attachment to the posterior calco astra- galan ligament; and immediately to the inner side of this tubercle is situated a sulcus, which admits the passage of the tendon of the m, flexor longus pollicis. The inferior surface is hollowed out into a large articular depression, which is concave from behind to before, to connect it with the ealcis: the circumference of this depression is rough for the attach- ment of ligaments. The neck of the bone is directed from the body, with an obliquity forwards and inwards, to terminate in the head of the bone. The superior surface of the neck is rough, for the attachment of hgaments, which strengthen the articulation between the astragalus and navicular bone. Its external surface is longer than its internal; and inferiorly, this portion of the bone is formed of a deep sulcus, directed from behind to before, and from within to without, which, in the recent subject, is filled up by strong ligaments, to connect the as- tragalus and calcis. The head of the astragalus is composed of an anterior and an inferior articular process: the anterior one, which is connected with the os naviculare, forms a considerable con- vexity from side to side, and is bounded by an irregular cir- cumference for the attachment of ligaments : the inferior one, which has its long axis directed from behind to before, with some slight obliquity outwards, is common to the inferior surface of the neck, as well as to the head of the bone, and is destined to be partly resting on the astragalus, and partly on a strong plantar ligament. Use.—This bone assists in forming the ancle-joint, receives the whole weight of the body from the tibia, and, by its articulation with the calcis and tarsal ligaments, it conveys the weight to the foot without pro- ducing concussion. Attachment of Muscles.—The only muscle attached to this bone is the tibialis posticus,

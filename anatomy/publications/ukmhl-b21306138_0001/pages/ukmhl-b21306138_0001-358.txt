THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 296 proportions of the parts of the skeleton, at different periods of life of the different sexes, or in the skeletons of the different races of mankind, but also variations occur in the dimensions, config'uration, and symmetry, in the skeletons of individuals of the same ag'e, sex, and nation. Thus, for instance, the skeleton of a full grown European measures about five feet six inches in the male, and about five feet one in the female; this, however, is subject to a great variety, from such causes as prevent the uniform developement and growth of the body; for we find the skeleton of a dwarf may measure only the half of the normal size, whilst that of the giant may surpass it by half, but rarely or never more than this. Some skeletons offer similar variations in the proportions between the trunk and the extremities, or between the extremities themselves, necessarily owing to variations in the length of the bones: they also sometimes differ in their configuration and sym- metry. The superiority in the developement of the bones of the right over the left side of the body, is often very decided ; and there can be no doubt of its being produced by the more frequent application of their use. Considering the number and the importance of the diseases which have their origin and seat in the various parts com- posing the skeleton, and which come especially under the practice of the surgeon, it would be almost a dereliction of duty on the part of a lecturer on anatomy, to an audience of intended surgeons, w^ere he to dismiss his lecture on the skeleton of the human subject, without offering at least a few general hints as to the configuration and relative position of all its principle parts, in order to illustrate, by so doing, as well their admirable adaptation to the performance of their respective functions, as the most rational and judicious means to be pursued in repairing the injuries to which they are liable, on rational and anatomical principles. And first, if we turn our attention to the cranium, or skull, and consider that it lodges the brainâ€”a substance in its nature so tender and susceptible of injury, that even the

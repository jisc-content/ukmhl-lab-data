ANATOMY OF NAILS. xHE nails, the next appendagâ€™e of the skin, are situated on the dorsal surface of the extremities of the fingers and toes. 1 hey are of an oblong, or irregular oval form. Tliey appear to be of the same substance as the cuticle, only of a denser structure. They are formed of thin plates, of a horny consistence, slightly arched or convex exteriorly, and concave internally. They are divided in three portions, the root, the .body, and the free extremity. The root is the thinnest and softest, and amounts to about one-fifth part of the whole nail. The root commences in a semilunar groove of the cutis, from ivhich it soon emerges, and then adheres to the cutis only on the inner surface of its body. The nail then projects through the cuticle, making an aperture in it corresponding with the two sides, the under portion of the free extremity, and the external portion of the root at the groove of the cutis. The cuticle, as it approaches the root of the nail, makes a duplicature beyond the edge of the groove of the cutis, thus forming a ridge of cuticle which is seen at the base of the nail; it here appears to divide, sending a thin process which spreads, projecting forwards, on the surface of the base of the nail; and another which passes down- w'ards into the groove of the cutis; (Vide Plate II. Fig. 15.a.) at the side of the nail, it curves round from the part included in the groove, continues along its sides, and passes inwards from the tip of the finger, some way under the free extremity of the nail; this structure is seen at Plate II. Fig. 15. b. The firm adhesion of the cuticle to the nail, and the manner in w'hieh the nail perforates the cuticle, is easily seen when the nail is separated in maceration. As the nail passes from the

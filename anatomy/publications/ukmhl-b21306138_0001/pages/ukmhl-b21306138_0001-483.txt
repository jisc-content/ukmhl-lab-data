97 descriptive anatomy of muscles. process of deglutition. To effect this multiplied action, we find the uvula connected with, or may indeed be said to be made up of all the muscles of the velum. Hence it is, as we frequently find in disease, that any loss of substance to this part interferes with these functions ; that the food passes into the nostrils, and that the voice also becomes altered and unnatural. Both for the purposes of degâ€™lutition and respiration, it is necessary for this narrow passag'e to be constantly lubricated by mucous; we find, therefore, a larg-e gland on either side the isthmus, placed under the influence of the two muscles which form the pillars of the fauces, and which compress the secretion from this gland at the very time it is most re- quired, while the food is passing; and it is further supposed by some physiologists, that the uvula assists in lubricating the pharynx, not only by its enlarged surface of mucous membrane, but also by directing the secretion of the tonsil gland into the middle line of the fauces and pharynx. The food having now been masticated, mixed with the saliva, and formed into a bolus by the motions of the tongue, is forced through the isthmus faucium by the constrictors of the fauces into a membranous muscular sac, which is termed the pharynx. The term sac, however, is not quite appropriate to its form, as will be found from a careful examination of the part. The posterior wall of the pharynx is made up' of three flat muscles, which are contiguous, but nevertheless lie on different planes with respect to each other; the one is superior, and at the same time anterior; the second inter- mediate, whilst the inferior is upon a plane posterior to both. This muscular wall, first considering it as one muscle, reaches from the cuneiform process of the occipital bone,' to the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, being of a funnel- shaped form, larger above than it is below; it is bounded posteriorly by the longus colli muscle, and the three su- perior cervical vertebrie; anteriorly it is formed by other organs into a canal, which has led me to say it is not ap- propriately called a sac ; it opens above into the nose; into H

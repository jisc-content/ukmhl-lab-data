62 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, course of the inner side of the thig-h this vein is found ex- ternal to the fascia lata, between it and the superficial aponeurosis, until it becomes lost at this point; below which the two portions of the fascia form one uninterrupted aponeurotic expansion. The edges of the cresentic opening are rendered indistinct by a process of fascia which connects them with Poupart’s ligament; this portion allows the passage of absorbent vessels from the superficial to the deep inguinal glands, and is by some anatomists termed the middle portion of fascia lata; until this is removed, neither the crescentic opening or the sheath of the femoral vessels are brought fairly into view. ' It is now only necessary to describe the parts connecting the abdominal cavity with the thigh. We have already adverted to the mode in which the thigh is connected to the abdomen by means of the different structures which pass under Poupart’s ligament; namely, the psoas iliacus and pectineus muscles, the crural nerves, femoral artery, vein and absorbents. Gimbernat’s ligament also assists in diminishing the size of the arch, and may be said to form its inner boundary. As regards the relative situation of these structures, the muscles will be found immediately applied to the bony margin of the pelvis; and lying on them we shall see the femoral artery in the centre, having to its outer side the nerve, to its inner the vein. To the inner side of the vein, between it and Gimbernat’s liga- ment, is a small space apparently filled up by cellular membrane and soft adipose structure, but which transmits the absorbents from the thigh into the abdominal cavity. It now remains to be shewn, how the passage of the artery, vein and absorbents are secured by the adaptation of two fasciae; the one derived from the anterior, the other from the posterior abdominal parietes: both of which descend with the vessels under Poupart’s ligament; and, contracting around them, prevent, under ordinary circumstances, the protrusion of the abdomial viscera through the same opening. One of these membranes, the fascia transversalis.

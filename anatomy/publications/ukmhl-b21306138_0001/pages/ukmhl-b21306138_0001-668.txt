282 GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. Secondly; there are follicles, which are opening's commu- nicating with minute cavities under the cutis, which secrete a sebacious oily matter. The use of this secretion seems to be for the purpose of lubricating the surface of the skin, and of defending it from the vicissitudes of temperature. Thirdly ; in some parts of the body there are little glan- dular structures found underneath the skin, which are termed miliary glands ; they are abundant in the axilla, and on the prepuce; they are for the purpose of defending the skin, by an oily secretion, from the effects of perspiration. This secretion is of a peculiar foetid smell, particularly in those who are not cleanly in their persons. The cutis is a highly organized substance; its arteries are extremely minute and numerous, as may be seen in successful injections; their principal accumulation is on its external surface, where they are seen to intersect and anastamose with each other in a great variety of directions ; in some instances, apparently taking the form of the meshes; in others, terminating 'in minute bundles, which present distinct spots of congregated vessels. I have great reason to think, that many of the beautiful injected preparations of the skin at the College of Surgeons, and other museums, are in some instances successful, not only in the true skin, but in the rete mueosum on its surface; in the latter of which the above-mentioned appearance is always more or less apparent. The veins of the cutis are also exceedingly numerous, and are larger than the arteries, take a similar mesh-like direc- tion, and probably terminate in a peculiar structure imme- diately underneath the cuticle; being furnished with valves, they are much more difficult to inject than the arteries, but have occasionally been so demonstrated on the prepuce. The absorbents on the surface of the cutis, are not easily demonstrated; although in the cellular membrane immedi- ately underneath, they are numerous, large, and easily injected. The nerves are numerous, and are distributed to the cutis

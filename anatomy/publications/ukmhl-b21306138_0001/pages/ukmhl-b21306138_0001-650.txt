264 GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. First:—As forming- a g-eneral covering- to the diSerent organs, at the same time connecting them in their relative position to each other, yet allowing of the free motion of their several parts. Secondly:—It enters into the composition of the minutest structures of the body. Under the first of these heads, we shall commence by noticing the general covering- of cellular membrane, imme- diately beneath the skin ; in this situation it is every where inseparably connected with the under surface of the cutis, and enters so abundantly into the composition of the com- mon integuments, that the true skin itself appears as if it were a condensation of cellular membrane upon the surface of the body. The cells are larger, and more lax, the farther they are removed from the cutis ; hence the mobility which the skin enjoys principally depends upon the abundance of cellular membrane underneath. In this respect, the sub- cutaneous cellular membrane varies according to its situa- tion, being generally admirably adapted to the motions of individual parts: where extensive motion is required, its fibres and plates are longer, and more elastic; while in parts where strength and support are necessary, its fibres are short and dense, and frequently mixed even with tendinous struc- tures. These differences of texture are particularly observ- able in the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet; it is also dense under the integuments of the cranium, whence the motions of the scalp, from its consequent firm adhesion to the muscles underneath. The cellular membrane is also found more dense along the mezian line which divides the trunk perpendicularly into symmetrical halves ; this line passes along the spinous processes of the vertebrae and sacrum, the raphe of the perineum, scrotum, the linea alba, sternum, and centre line of the face and head. The existence of this line is evinced by the effects of emphysema, which are here checked in their progress ; and artificially one half of the subcutaneous cellular membrane throughout the body has been Inflated,

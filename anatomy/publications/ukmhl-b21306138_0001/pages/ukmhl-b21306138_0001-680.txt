GENERAL, ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. tinous fluid, probably only the serum of the blood over the whole surface of the wound, being- apparently inorganised ; secondly, it shews signs of organization in the formation of circular granulations, which secrete more or less pus, and becoming- gradually contracted on their surfaces, put on the appearance of a mucous membrane; when, lastly, cuticle is secreted, and cicatrization completed. When this process is first completed, the new-formed skin does not possess the same properties as the old skin, being less elastic, of a more opaque colour, and through life remains more liable to ulceration. This is the case with respect to the new forma- tion of every structure in the body, as well as that of the skin ; for it has been found in bad cases of scurvy produced by long voyages, that not only old cicatrices have' re-opened by the ulcerative process ; but that united fractures of long standing- have also become again separated. This tendency to ulceration, depends apparently upon newly-secreted structures never becoming so vascular as when originally formed. It is believed by some and denied by others, that the rete mueosum is regenerated in cicatrices ; Camper is of opinion, that it is not, and instances it by the assertion, that cica- trices in Negroes remain-of a white colour; this is not admitted as a fact by others ; who assert that it is only an alteration in the degree of colour, and producing therefore only a different shade ; which may arise from the new rete mueosum, like the cutis, being less vascular.' There are various opinions with respect to the formation of new skin ; whether or not the vessels from granulations are capable of producing it; or whether it can only be formed from the vessels of the old skin : and it is usually believed, that portions of new skin, which are frequently formed in the middle of old ulcers, are never generated into cicatrix, but become absorbed; and that the formation of the cica- trix must take place from the circumference of the sore, and from the edges of the old skin. As far as I have observed, this depends upon the depth more than the extent of sur-

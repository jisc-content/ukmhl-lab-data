THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 29T 'slig-htest local pressure is often sufficient to disturb its func- tion, and which consequently require some very solid covering- to protect itâ€”we shall find that it is constructed like an architectural vault, by which it is best able to counteract pressure, and to resist the influence of violence. We further find, as a means of protection to the important organ con- tained within the skull, that the arch formed by the two parietal bones is not perfectly circular, but that there is a projection at the centre of each, and that they are thicker and more convex at this part, by which these two bones afford, according to the principle of arches, an important protection to the temporal as well as to the sphenoid bone, in cases of violent concussion. It may also be observed, that all those parts of the skull which are most exposed to injury from ex- ternal violence, are the most strong, from their greater con- ve.xity and thickness. But the sutures also give great se- curity to the arch of the cranium, which are not only well adapted, by their dove-tailing construction, to hold each bone in its natural situation, but at the same time that they give strength to the whole apparatus, they serve to obviate the effects of concussion upon the brain. During the early period of life, we find the cranium, as at birth, remarkably yielding and elastic; and hence it is, that the many falls and accidents incident to that period, occur for the most part with impunity; and again, if we examine the texture of tlie cranium in the adult, we find that it consists of two layers or tables, with a soft diploe between them; the outer table being very tough, is well calculated to resist such blows as might injure the brain by concussion; while the inner layer is hard and brittle, well calculated to resist any thing penetrating from without. Regarding the developement of the cranium, not only is it soft and yielding at birth, but the sutures at this period, as well as a portion of the bones which enter into their for- mation, are in a state of cartilage; and hence it is that during parturition, the bones of the skull overlap at their edges, and thus diminish the size of the head. During childhood, as

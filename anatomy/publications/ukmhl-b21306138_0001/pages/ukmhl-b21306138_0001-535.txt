T.he lumbar fascia, which is the strong-est, consists of three distinct layers ; the posterior of which can only be seen in this progâ€™ress ol dis- section, but the deeper seated ones may be afterw^ards traced to their attachments. The posterior layer of the fascia lumborum is attached to the apices of the spinous processes of the sacrum, and posterior labium of the crista of the ilium ; from below it proceeds upwards, being' attached to the spinous processes of all the lumbar and the last dorsal vertebra, and forms in this situation a common origin to the latissimus dorsi, serratus posticus inferior, and obliquus abdominis internus muscles. This fascia, as it presents itself to view upon the back, is of an oval form, being broader in the centre than at its two extremities. The second layer arises from the apices of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, in common with the transversalis abdominis, where it is connected with the pos- terior layer so as to inclose the sacro lumbalis and longis- simus dorsi in a complete aponeurotic sheath, between the spinous and transverse processes of the vertebrae. The third layer is attached to the roots of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, passes in front of the quadratus lumborum, being placed between it and the peri- toneum, proceeds upwards as far as the inferior edg*e of the last rib, where it is attached to the ligamentum areuatum, and below terminating on the crista ilii; this layer also pro- ceeds to the apices of the transverse processes, and is there connected with the other two layers, so that at this point, which is at the posterior termination of the transversalis muscle, it may be said that the fascia lumborum divides into its three layers ; the anterior one to be attached to the roots, the middle one to the apices of the transverse processes, and the posterior one to the spinous processes of all the lumbar vertebrae.

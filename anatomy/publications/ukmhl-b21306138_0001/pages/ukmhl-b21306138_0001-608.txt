222 DESClUmVE anatomy ok muscles, inserted into the outer side of the root of the first phalanx of the fourth toe. Use.—To separate the fourth from the three inner toes. These muscles, collectively, streng-then the arch of the foot in a transverse direction, by drawing- the metatarsal bones closer tog-ether; and although, separately, they serve to abduct and adduct the toes, yet, collectively, they assist in their extension. The m. extensor brevis digitorwm—arises tendinous and fleshy from the upper and anterior surface of the os calcis, from the astrag-alus, annular lig-ament, and os cuboides; from these origins, its fibres form a flat fleshy belly, which separates at its anterior part, and terminates in four slender tendons to be inserted into the four inner toes; the inner- most tendon, which is the strongest, into the first phalanx of the great toe; while the tendons in common with the ex- tensor longus digitorum, unite to form the aponeurotic expansion which covers the dorsal surface of the three middle toes. The fleshy fibres of this muscle lie under the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum, and peroneus tertius, but are not concealed by them ; the inferior surface lies on the tarsus, metatarsus, interossei superiores, and the phalanges. The flat and slender tendons of this muscle, although they lie above the superior interossei, do not so cover them as to prevent their dissection in the order in which they have been described.

INTRODUCTION. I HAVE in this Volume endeavoured to follow up my original plan, of placing before my Pupils a general outline of my Lectures as delivered in the Anatomical School of Guyâ€™s Hospital, This portion of my projected work will be found to comprise the General and Descriptive Anatomy of Muscles, Cellular Membrane, and the common Integuments; thus concluding the exterior struc- tures of the body. My object has been to render the subject clear to the Pupil, in the direct progress of his ana- tomical studies; which may have betrayed me occasionally into prolixity and tautology. I have, however, steadily kept the advantage of my plan in view; which has been to present a correct course of anatomy, combined with surgical and physiological remarks : regarding the utility of my purpose more, than the production of an elabo- rate or erudite performance.

PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 222 Articulation of the Body of the Rib to its Cartilage. There are some anterior and posterior ligamentous fibres, which pass from the bodies of all the ribs to their respective cartilages, and connect them firmly together. The cartilages of the seven superior ribs pass forwards, to be attached to the sternum, with which they are connected by an anterior and posterior ligament, and synovial membrane. The anterior ligament is fixed to the extremity of the car- tilage ; it then passes, with its fibres diverging, to be fixed to the anterior part of the sternum, upon which it spreads itself, and interlaces with those of the opposite side, and with the periosteum, as well as with the anterior ligament of the car- tilage of the rib above and below it, so as to form a complete ligamentous covering to the sternum. This decussation of the fibres is more particularly obvious at the union of the sixth and seventh cartilag-inous articulations with the ster- num, than at any other part. The posterior ligament is not so thick as the anterior, but is attached, like it, to the cartilages of the ribs, and to the sternum ; while, on its posterior surface, it diverges and interlaces with the ligaments above and below, and with the periosteum, forming a complete posterior covering to the sternum. The synovial membrane which covers the articular surface of the cartilage of the rib and of the sternum, is extremely small; and were it not for the occasional occurrence of an inordinate secretion of synovia, the result of inflammation, its existence might almost be doubted. The seventh rib being attached to the cartilago-ensiformis, its ligament is some- times called the ligamentum. ensiforme. Articulation of the False Ribs. These bones are all connected together by their cartilages excepting the last, which is only attached by muscle. Their

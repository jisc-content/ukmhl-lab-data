156 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. as it ascends, and is inserted into the occipital bone, in a space between the inferior transverse ridge and the foramen magnum. Its posterior surface is partly covered by the rectus capitis posticus major ; but a portion on the inner side is left un- covered by that muscle, and is in contact with the corn- plexus ; its anterior surface lies upon the posterior circular ligament, vertebral artery, and occipital bone. Use.—To assist the preceding muscle in drawing the head backwards. The m. obliquus capitis superior—arises tendinous from the posterior and upper part of the extremity of the trans- verse process of the first cervical vertebra; from this origin it forms an elongated muscle, which becomes broader as it ascends, and passes inwards to be inserted by tendinous fibres into the inferior transverse ridg’e of the occiput, some- times reaching as far as the mastoid process. This muscle is situated between the atlas and occiput; it is covered by the complexus and splenius; it covers the posterior circular ligament, the vertebral artery, and the occipital bone; at its insertion it conceals some of the fibres of the rectus capitis posticus major. A triangular space is seen between this muscle and the rectus capitis major, in which is placed the vertebral artery and suboc- eipital nerve. Use.—When both muscles are in action, it draws the head backwards; it directs it, when singly, to that side on which the muscle is exerted. The m. obliquus capitis inferior—arises tendinous and fleshy from the extremity of the spinous process of the second cervical vertebra; it then passes obliquely upwards, for- wards, and outwards to be inserted by short tendinous fibres into the posterior and inferior surface of the transverse process of the atlas. This muscle is covered by the complexus and trachelo mastoideus, excepting a small portion which is seen between them ; its origin is covered by the origin of the rectus capitis posticus major.

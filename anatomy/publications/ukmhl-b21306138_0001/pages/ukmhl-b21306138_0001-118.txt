74 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. The Mouth. The osseous parts of this cavity are formed above, by the superior maxillary and palate bones, constituting the hard palate or roof of the mouth: laterally and below, by the in- ferior jaw. The thirty-two teeth also form a considerable portion of these boundaries. Practical Remarks. The numerous diseases to which the mouth is liable, arising from the various structures which enter into its composition, render it more de- sirable to defer their consideration until each structure is separately described.

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 179 There are also in some subjects, a few muscular fibres arising from the ramus ischii, which proceed inwards above and deeper seated than the preceding- muscle, to be inserted into the accelerator urinse: this is termed the m. transversus perineei alter, is usually wanting-, but ought only to be con- sidered as a part of the accelerator muscle. This muscle is bounded, anteriorly, by the erector penis, and accelerator urinae; posteriorly, by the sphincter ani; and externally, by the deep branch of the internal pudic artery. Use.—To support the anus, and to dilate the bulb of the urethra. The transversus perinsei muscle forms the base of a triangular space, which is bounded, externally, by the erector penis; internally, by the accelerator urinse, and urethra ; and, in front and above, by the corpus cavernosum. Through this space, on the left side of the patient, the knife is di- rected to the groove of the staff in the operation of lithotomy, as well as the lancet when plunged in opening deep perineeal abscesses. The accelerator urinse, and the erector penis, with the transversus perinsei of either side, should now be carefully removed from their attachments, so as to expose the deep perinaeal fascia, which should now be examined. The fascia perinsei profunda—is situated behind the pre- ceding muscles ; and by its junction with the triangular liga- ment of the pubes, separates the pelvis from the perinseura, being furnished however with two openings, through the upper of which the urethra passes, and the rectum through the lower. Tracing this fascia from below upwards, it will be found to begin from the inner side of the tuberosity of the ischium, there being connected with the posterior sacro sciatic ligament, covering the internal pudic artery; it pro- ceeds upwards, attached to the ascending ramus of the ischium, and descending ramus of the pubes as far as the triangular ligament of the pubes, with which it joins on its under surface, passing across to the bones of the opposite

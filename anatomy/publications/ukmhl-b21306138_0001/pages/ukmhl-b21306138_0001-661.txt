GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. 275 never secreted, as under the scalp, eyelids, nose, ear, scro- tum, prepuce, nymphao; on the external surface of the body, and internally in the substance of the uterus, liver, spleen, and between the coats of the stomach, and intestines. The secretion of adeps is of considerable importance in the animal economy; it may be said to form a source of nutrition when the stomach and intestines are deranged in their natural functions; it forms a protection against the effects of cold, particularly in children, who, possessing such a clothing of subcutaneous fat, are liable to resist the effects of cold in a remarkable manner; while, on the contrary, those who are emaciated, from protracted disease or from age, are painfully sensible to the vicissitudes of temperature. It may be observed, that the secretion of adeps is more abundant towards winter; and this is particularly ob- servable in certain birds, quadrupeds, and hybernating animals. Fat, in its formation, answers a most essential purpose, not only as a source of nutrition, but for the office which it performs in disposing of a considerable quantity of car- bon, which materially contributes to the purifying of the blood; hence it is that we see persons, who are confined in unhealthy situations and impure air, frequently become loaded with unhealthy fat. The quantity of fat in a healthy adult, amounts to one twentieth part of the weight of the whole body ; but, at times and from causes not understood, it will accumulate even to the surprising quantity of four-fifths of the weight of the body. The circumstances which tend to an accumulation of fat, are indolence of habit, rest of body, and ease of mind. Castration, also, increases the growth of fat; probably from the diminished excitability of animals under such circumstances. It is remarkable, that great growth of fat in the female obstructs the generative powers ; this is observed in domestic

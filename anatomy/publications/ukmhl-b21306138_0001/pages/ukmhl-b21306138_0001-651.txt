GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. 2G5 independently of the other. On the contrary, this structure is found more lax in the eyelids, the face, the neck, the axilla, the abdomen, the groins, the scrotum, and in the popliteal region. The next situation in which we shall remark this structure is, in the g'eneral covering which it affords to the muscles, independent of its intimate union with their ultimate fibres. Here also, as in the subcutaneous arrangement, it will be found more abundant in all those parts where motion is most extensive; thus in the muscles of the face, where varied motion is employed in each changing expression of the features; in the neck, where the muscles are numerous, lengthened, extensive in their motions, and accompanied by numerous large blood-vessels; between the muscles of the chest, and around the mammae ; in the axillae, where large blood-vessels, nerves, absorbents and glands are embedded, between the great muscles of the back and chest; between the muscles forming the parietes of the abdomen ; in the groins, bend of the knees; and particularly between the larger muscles of the extremities. In the soles of the feet, and palms of the hands, the deep- seated cellular membrane, as the subcutaneous, is abundant; but in these situations it is peculiar from enclosing cells of adeps, mixed with strong tendinous fibres, forming a cushion to resist the effects of pressure on the parts underneath ; a similar structure is found, for a similar purpose, beneath the tuberosities of the ischia. We shall next observe the covering which the cellular membrane gives to the viscera, and other important organs situated within the cavities of the body. Hence we may first observe, that the secreting glands are more or less covered with cellular membrane, independent of any motion required in these parts; such, for instance, is the case with the kidney, and capsulae renales, which are not only furnished with this structure external to their aponeurotic envelops, but also between them and the glands themselves. The cellular membrane also surrounds the liver, pancreas.

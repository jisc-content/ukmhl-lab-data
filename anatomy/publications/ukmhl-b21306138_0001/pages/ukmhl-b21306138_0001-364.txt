302 THK SKELETON IN GENERAL. the upper of which form a convexity forwards, to such a degree as to be on a line perpendicular to the centre of gravity; from thence they pass backwards to a considerable extent, that the last lumbar vertebra may be articulated with the sacrum, so as to diminish tlie shock that would otherwise be communicated to the spine, in a direction perpendicular to the skull. The flexibility of the spine is secured by the column being- composed of twenty-four pieces, which are connected with each other by moveable articulations ; and although there is but a slight degree of motion permitted between any two of these bones, yet the combination of the motions of all amount to an extent suflBcient to produce necessary ad- justments of the body. The strength of the spinal column is secured by each ver- tebra consisting of a double arch of bone, rendering it thereby well adapted to counteract external violence, and forming at the same time a cavity for the spinal marrow. The size of the vertebrfB increases from above to below, in a proportion equal to the accumulation of weight they have to support as they descend towards the pelvis. The great strength of the entire column is evinced by the weight man is able to bear upon his head, or upon his back. The spine of the human subject rests on the sacrum, one of the bones of the pelvis, at an angle which has been al- ready noticed as highly beneficial in preventing concussion ; but this is not the only provision which nature has made against injury to the brain and spinal marrow; for the sa- crum is so joined to the other bones of the pelvis, by fibro- cartilaginous tissue and ligaments, that it may be rather said to hang to them in slings than to form any true joint; and hence it is that violence inflicted on the pelvis can only in a comparatively slight degree be communicated to the spine. The chest, or thorax, which is composed of the twelve dorsal vertebraj behind, the twelve ribs on either side, and the sternum in front, forms a conical cavity for the lodgement of the organs of respiration and circulation. These bones

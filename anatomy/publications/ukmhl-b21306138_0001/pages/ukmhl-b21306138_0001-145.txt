Bones op the trunk. 97 rendered more or less smooth, immediately beneath the infe- rior edg’e of the acetabulum, by the action of the obturator ex- ternus muscle. The anterior edge of the neck and body form a semilunar sharp ridge, constituting the posterior boundary of the obturator foramen. Below the neck is situated the tu- berosity, which is the portion of the pelvis upon which we rest in the sitting posture. This process is rough behind, for the attachment of muscles of the lower extremity. Anteri- orly it is hollowed out, to assist the neck in forming the obturator foramen: and internally, immediately beneath the spinous process, is situated a sulcus, which allows of the pas- sage of the obturator internus muscle out of the pelvis: and on this region a second furrow may be seen extending along the lower margin of the tuberosity towards the ascending ramus, which lodges the internal pudic artery. Extending obliquely upwards and forwards from the tuberosity, is the ascending ramus of the ischium, which presents two flattened surfaces, and two edges. The anterior edge assists in form- ing- one side of the pubic arch, and the posterior bounds the inferior and anterior portion of the obturator foramen. Tlie internal surface is directed inwards and backwards, to pro- duce a part of the lower circumference of the pelvis; and the external is rough, for the attachment of some of the muscles of the hip-joint. Connexion.—The ischium is joined anteriorly and inferi- orly to the pubes, by its ascending ramus : to the ilium and pubes, within the acetabulum, of which it forms the under and largest part. In conjunction with the pubes, it also forms the obturator foramen. The Os Pubis Is the smallest of the three bones which form the os innominatum: it is divided into its body, horizontal plate, spinous process, symphysis, and descending ramus. The body is the thickest part of the bone ; and is furnished, at its H

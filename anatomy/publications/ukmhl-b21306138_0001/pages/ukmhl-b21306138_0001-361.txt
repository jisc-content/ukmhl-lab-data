THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 299 nearly the same horizontal plain with the cheek bones ; the space between the eyes very broad. Third.—The Amei'ican variety, like the Mongolian, is cha- racterized by the considerable breadth of the cranium ; the forehead is somewhat retreating-; the cheek bones are larg-e and prominent, but are rounded, instead of being- angular like those of the Mongolian; the nasal bones are flattened, but more prominent than in the Mongolian ; the orbits are remarkably deep and large; the nasal cavities are likewise large; the occiput is said to be somewhat flat, and the pro- tuberances wliich mark the seat of the cerebellum, not very prominent. The skulls of Americans are light; and, as it would appear from a circumstance related by Azzara, and quoted by Dr. Pritchard, they more rapidly decompose after interment than the skulls of Europeans. Fourth.—The Mthiofian head is compressed and narrow; the forehead is very convex ; the face bears the largest pro- portion to the cranium ; the superfices of the face, relatively to that of the cranium, being one eighth larger than in the European ; the cheek bones and jaws project forwards ; the alveolar edge is long, narrow, and elliptical; the front teeth of the upper jaw are turned obliquely forwards ; the lower jaw is strong and very large ; but the chin is retracted. The whole skull is thick and heavy. Fifth.—The character of the Malay head approaches more nearly to the laterally compressed form of the ^Ethiopian, than to the breadth of the Mongolian ; but the cranium bears a larger proportion to the face: the summit of the head is narrow ; the forehead is somewhat arched, and frequently ‘ 'capacious ; the vertex elevated, and the prominence of the parietal bones often strongly marked; the cheek bones not prominent, but broader than in the .Ethiopian; the lower jaw ratlier prominent. Several skulls in the museum at Guy’s Hospital, belonging to this race, are in good propor- tions ; but there is in all a disposition to preponderance of the posterior part.

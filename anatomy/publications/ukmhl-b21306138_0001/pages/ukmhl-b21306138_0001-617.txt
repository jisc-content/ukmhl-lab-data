L DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 231 A remarkable difference occurs in the gait of different people in the act of walldng, and in some instances suffi- ciently demonstrable to form a national distinction 5 this depends upon different causes, and is more especially to be observed between the inhabitants of mountains, and sandy districts; in the former, the knees arc bent, with the body directed forwards ; while in the latter, the foot is placed flat upon the ground, for the purpose of affording a larger sur- face of resistance than could be presented by the heel. It is obvious, in walking in a straight line, that the motions described by each lower extremity, must be equal; without which, the body will turn from that side in which the motion is greater. In walking up hill, the increased fatigue is owing to the exertion which is required in the greater flexion of the limb which is carried forward and upwards ; while the limb behind has not only to move upon the pelvis, but to raise the whole weight of the body, in order to transmit its weight to the elevated and advanced limb. Running differs from walking in the quickness with which the w'eight of the body is transmitted from one limb to the other ; during which, a period occurs when both feet are off the ground, the body being thrown forwards and upwards by the hinder foot springing upwards before the advanced one reaches the ground 5 hence running approaches to a continued succession of leaps from one leg. In jumping, the articulations of the lower extremities are considerably bent, and then being suddenly and powerfully extended, the body is pushed, as it were, from the ground ; while at the same time, the arms are raised and directed forwards, to give the muscles attached to the upper extre- mities and trunk a power of drawing the body forwards : this assistance from the upper extremities, is principally required when jumping a distance; for when leaping a height, the body is maintained in an upright direction. Swimming.â€”It is doubtful whether or not this power is natural to man ; but, perhaps, the circumstance of his spe- cific gravity being less than that of sea water, would lead

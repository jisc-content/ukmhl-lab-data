LNTRODUCTORY LECTURE. If the importance of a science be estimated by its utility, that which ministers to the welfare of mankind, by removing- the diseases and repairing the injuries to which the human frame is liable, must be entitled to no subordinate rank. As the exercise of our profession demands a knowledge not only of the principles of that science, but of their practical application in every case that may arise, it behoves us, from a sense of honor, of interest, and of duty, to estabhsh those principles on the most solid foundation. In the natural order and relation of things, the study of pathology must be consequent upon that of anatomy and physiology ; for it is only by an accurate knowledge of the structure of the human body, and of the functions of its different organs, in a state of health, that we can determine the nature of disease, and adopt rational and judicious rules for its treatment. To ascertain the structure of organized matter, is the proper object of anatomy; that of physiology, is to define the functions of the different organs ; and that of pathology, is to distinguish the diseases or morbid affec- tions to which they are liable. But before we proceed to consider the human body as organized matter, let us enquire into the points of affinity and of difference wdiich it exhibits in relation to matter not organized. We find, for instance, that the human frame possesses the essential properties common to all matter, as extension, form, divisibility, inertion and at- traction : hence we are led to infer, that the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, are but different modifications of the same elementary matter; and that, in this respect, man must acknowledge an affinity with the tree that yields to him its fruit and its shade, and with the very rock, from which he

u 2 LECTURE XI. THE SKELETON. By the skeleton is meant the assemblage of all the bones of an animal, united in their natural situation, either by means of their own ligaments, or by some foreign substance; the former being called a natural, the latter an artificial skeleton. The skeleton of the human subject constitutes a symmet- rical figure, both as regards its form and dimensions, according to which, the figure and proportions of the whole body are in a great measure determined. We find that the body may be divided, by an imaginary middle line, into two distinct symmet- rical halves, producing thus an evident lateral correspondence; and in no system is this more obvious than in the osseous, although, indeed, the same principle applies to the general contour of the body. But so perfect is the division in the osseous system, that even the azygos bones are so centrically situated, as to admit of a corresponding division by an imagi- nary mezian line. The skeleton is divided into the head, trunk, and extremi- ties. The trunk, which constitutes the most considerable of these divisions, is formed of a middle lineâ€”the vertebral column, which must be considered as the most important part of the skeleton, forming, in fact, the great bond of union to all the rest of the bones. Its superior extremity is greatly developed and expanded, constituting the skull; while the rest of its extent belongs to the trunk, composing, in part, the neck, thorax, and abdomen. The head and trunk present two great cavities ; the supe- rior and posterior one, formed by the bones of the cranium and vertebral canal, lodges the brain and the whole of the

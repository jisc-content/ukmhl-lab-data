PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 218 All the motions of the spine are capable of being’ aided to a great extent, by the motion of the pelvis upon the thig’hs. Motions peculiar to each Region. The extent of motion in the several regions of the spine, is in proportion to the thickness of the intervertebral substance ; it is, therefore, much greater and more extensive in the cer- vical and lumbar regions than in the dorsal, in which it is not only impeded by the comparative tenuity of this substance, but also by the oblique directions of the spinous processes of these vertebrae, and their attachment to the ribs. The reason for the stability of this region is obvious, when we consider the important organs which the dorsal vertebra assist in en- closing, and that extensive motion would necessarily interfere w ith their functions. Motions between particular Vertebra. The free motion of one vertebra on another is particularly exempUfied in the first and second cervical. The occiput is so articulated with the atlas, that flexion, extension, and, in a slight degree, lateral motion, are allowed between them ; but if there be necessity for these motions to any extent, the whole of the cervical vertebrae participate in them. It is, however, in the rotatory motion of the head, that the first and second cervical vertebrae act upon one another; and the spe- cies of articulation formed by these two bones shews how well they are calculated for that purpose, and how essential they are in the performance of most of the animal functions : for they may justly be said to increase and regulate the powers of vision, smell, and hearing ; and by shortening and prolonging the trachea, alter the tones of the voice, and assist in producing a free passage of air to and from the lung's.

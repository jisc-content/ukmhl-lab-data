14 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. by bowing- forwards when in action. The widening of a mus- cle is also doubtful, while it is in a state of contraction ; for that appearance, and also the wrinkled state, seems to be produced, rather by those fibres which are not contracted than those which are, as well as by the cellular membrane; so that it seems probable, that the fibres of a muscle during action, where the stimulus is capable of overcoming the re- sistance, produces an approximation of every fibre in action, diminishing at the same time both the length and breadth of a muscle, and, consequently, diminishing also its bulk and producing its hardness. There has, however, been much variance of opinion upon the subject of the enlarge- ment or diminution of muscle during its contraction; and experiments have been instituted by physiologists to discover their actual state, although nothing very conclusive has ever been ascertained. Glisson seemed to conclude, from his experiments, that the muscle was actually diminished in bulk during contraction. Sir Anthony Carlisle considered that their bulk was increased, and produefed therefore a rising of the fluid, into which the living arm of a man was immersed: while Sir Gilbert Blane was of opinion, that no change of bulk was evident during the contracted state of the muscular fibre ; and his experiment was made by enclosing a living eel in a vessel, the neck of which was drawn out in a fine tube, wdien, by irritating the animal so as to produce its contraction, the fluid was found to remain perfectly stationary in the tube of the vessel: but they all agree, that the muscle becomes harder while in action ; of which we have a ready proof by feehng our masseter muscle while at rest, and during the process of mastication. It is also a question as to the quantity of blood in a muscle during its state of contraction, whether or not there be less at that time than when in a state of relaxation: the latter we are led to be- lieve, from a change of colour which is said to be ob- served during its action ; as well as from the fact, that the blood flows more readily from the superficial veins when the muscles are made forcibly to contract. Hence it seems

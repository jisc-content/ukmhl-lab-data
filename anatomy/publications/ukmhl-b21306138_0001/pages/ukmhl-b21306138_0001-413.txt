general anatomy of muscles. 27 contain, in proportion to their size, the most fibres; and they are therefore found in situations where great power and quickness, rather than great extent of motion, is re- quired ; as, for instance, in the articulation of the lower jaw witli the temporal bones, in the hand, foot, &c. The middle, or most fleshy part of the muscle, is called the belly; the superior part, or that which forms the origin or more fixed point, is termed the head; whilst the opposite extreme, or more moveable point of a muscle, is called the tail. In ordinary circumstances, the contraction of a muscle takes place in such a manner as to draw the tail, or point of insertion of the muscle, towards the head, or point of origin; but this is not universal. The external form of the muscles varies considerably, as well as the direction of their fibres, so as to lead to distin- guishing terms of simple, compound, penniform, semi- penniform muscles, &c. A muscle is termed simple, when it is composed of a single head and terminating by one tail into a single fixed point; so that the course of all its fibres is exactly the same as the course of the muscle itself, and consequently its force is exercised in the line of its direc- tion ; this is the most simple arrangement. Other muscles divide at one of their extremities into several parts, and are called therefore compound muscles; this division may take place at either their origin or insertion, as may be observed in the muscles of the abdomen, and of the toes and fingers ; in the former case, the contraction of the whole muscle would give to the moveable part a motion in the mean direction of all the forces employed; while in the latter, the contraction of the single belly would put several parts in motion at the same time. It should be observed, how- ever, that some of the simple muscles seem to form an intermediate link between the simple and compound ones, as the deltoid and subscapular muscles. The penniform muscles are those which are composed of two sets of fibres, passing to be inserted at a greater or

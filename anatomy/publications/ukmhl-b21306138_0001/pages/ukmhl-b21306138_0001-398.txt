12 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. its form, texture and external character ; but superadded to these it also displays powers which disting^uish it as forming a considerable part of a living organized body: hence it is, that the properties of muscle have been rightly divided by all physiologists into physical and vital. The physical properties of the muscular fibre depend upon its form, structure, and general external characters; and may be considered to be flexibility, extensibility, adhe- siveness, and elasticity. These properties, however, are with considerable difficulty appreciated, in consequence of the various structures which surround and connect them ; a dif- ficulty, too, not a little enhanced in many instances by the influence of divers circumstances affecting the muscles, either before or subsequent to death. Subjected to the action of cold, they lose much of their red colour as well as a large proportion of their weight, becoming hard, of a brown colour, and semitransparent; changes greatly acce- lerated by exposing them to the action of a current of dry- air. By maceration, a muscle undergoes several changes, which vary with the kind of fluid to which it is exposed: thus, alcohol and diluted acids cause it to soften and swell; a solution of corrosive sublimate, or alum, causes its fibres to separate by the shrinking of the cellular membrane surrounding them, and increases the consistency of the muscular fibre itself by inducing its contraction. A solu- tion of common salt will produce the same efiect of ren- dering it harder; and, at the same time, will increase the redness of its colour. If muscle be exposed to the process of boiling for a considerable time, its fibres become en- tirely colourless, are easily separable, and, if analysed, are found to resemble the fibrine of the blood, like it, be- coming fragile when cold. If exposed to a strong- dry heat, so as to be calcined, it is said by Berzelius to leave a saline matter amounting to one-twentieth part of its weight. The physical elasticity of the muscular fibre,â€”which is mentioned by some physiologists, and which is contended for in consequence of the apparent power a muscle has to

THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 30t) additional streng’th, whilst the lower extremities may be con- sidered as supporters to this arch. The axis of the pelvis is not perpendicular to the central line of gravity, hence the viscera of the pelvis are infinitely better supported by the bones, and the whole weight of the body is thrown upon the lower extremities. The human subject, by this arrangement, is also enabled to support the erect position ; while the expansion of the bones afford ample attachment for those muscles which are destined to maintain it. In the sitting posture, the axis of the pelvis is so altered, that the central line of gravity falls upon the tuberosities of the isehia, upon which the whole weight of the body is then equipoised—a position which would have been impossi- ble to man, had the sacrum continued in the same line with the spine; or, in other words, had the axis of the pelvis been perpendicular with the line of gravity of the body. In the descriptive anatomy of the pelvis, the cartilages and liga- ments which serve to connect the bones have been noticed; which are not only destined to form the medium of connexion between them, but also to obviate the effects of concussion upon the spine and viscera which they contain. The variation of size in the male and female pelvis has already been alluded to: the lateral proportions in the female infinitely preponderating, to allow of the increase of size of the uterus during its impregnated state. The greater proportionable size, length, and strength of the inferior extremities of the human species, when com- pared with those of inferior animals, proves, with the facts already stated of the form and position of the pelvis, that man alone was intended to support himself in the erect posture. The thigh-bone we find articulated with the pelvis by its head, which forms a considerable portion of a sphere, being admitted into a deep cotyloid cavity, and being further con- nected with this cavity by a strong interarticular ligament, rendering this articulation well fitted to bear the weight of

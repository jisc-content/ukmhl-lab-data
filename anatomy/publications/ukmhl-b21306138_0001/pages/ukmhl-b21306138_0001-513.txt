DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 127 Use.—To extend tlie wrist-joint by drawing tbe hand backwards, and assist in bending the fore arm; it is one of three extensors of the wrist-joint. The m. extensor carpi radialis brevior—arises from the back part of the e.xternal condyle of the humerus and ex- ternal lateral lig-ament, immediately below the origin of the extensor carpi radialis longior: it then forms a thick belly which passes over the superior radio ulnar articulation, continues down along the back part of the radius, and terminates in a round tendon, which proceeds through the same groove with the last described muscle, under the annular ligament, to be inserted into the posterior part of the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. This muscle at its origin lies between the extensor carpi radialis longior, which is above and anterior to it, and the extensor longus digitorum, which is behind it; then pro- ceeds along the fore arm, partly covered by the extensor carpi radialis longior; its tendon runs through .the same gToove with it, under the extensors of the thumb ; after which it separates from the tendon of the longior and passes under the indicator to its insertion. Use.—The same as the last muscle; and is the second extensor proper to the wrist. The m. extensor digitorum communis—arises from the external condyle by a tendon common to it, the extensor carpi radialis brevior and the extensor carpi ulnaris ; a por- tion of this tendon runs down in the course of the inner side of the muscle, which it divides into fasciculi, the inner of which is by some anatomists termed the extensor proprius minimi digit!; a similar process of tendon runs down on the outer side of the muscle, and separates it from the extensor carpi radialis brevior. This muscle also arises posteriorly from the inner surface of the fascia of the fore arm ; it then- forms a fleshy belly of unequal thickness, but thickest in the centre; it passes downwards obhquely towards the inner part of the fore arm, and at the middle of its posterior surface divides into four distinct tendons which

LECTURES ON ANATOMY. XXXVI whether you are to be the most useful or the most dang’erous members of society. I feel, therefore, as surg'eon of this hospital, and your teacher of anatomy, that I ought, in terms of no ordinary earnestness, to impress on your minds the necessity of a diligent and judicious application of your time during your stay at this school. The interest I take in your w elfare, the anxiety I feel for your advancement to eminence, the satisfaction I shall ever derive from the reflection of having contributed to it, and the hope (not I trust a mis- placed or visionary hope) which I cherish that my wishes will be realized, call loudly on me to intreat your assistance in the undertaking.

It evinces indeed no small strength of mind, to persevere in habits of industry, uncheered by the animating pleasure of perceiving the advancement made; which, like that of the hand of the clock, w’hich uneringly accomplishes its circles of the hour, yet so gradually as to escape observation. Remember, that anatomy is the basis of surgery ; and that if the basis be not solid, the super- structure cannot be secure: there scarcely exists a case in surgery in which the knowledge of anatomy is not required: and I have little hesitation in asserting, that wffien profes- sional disgrace has fallen upon any members of our pro- fession, it is very rarely that the causes of that disgrace, may not have been ascribable to ignorance of this essential de-

GENERAL ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 199 internally by an iraporfoct synovial membrane. The old articular cavity, from which the head of the bone had been thrown, beingâ€™ rtow rendered useless, becomes partly oblite- rated, much altered in form, and filled up by a fibro-cartila- ginous tissue. Synarthrosis. Synarthrosis is the name given to those articulations where the bones are joined by a single intervening cartilage, inse- parably united to them both, and allowing of a mere yielding, which is greater or less in proportion to the thickness of the connecting structure. It is made use of to unite different portions of bone into one apparently solid fabric; which, by this combination, is rendered less obnoxious to injury than if it had originally consisted of one entire bone. These articu- lations are strengthened by the periosteum, which passes from one bone to the other; and, in many instances, by ligamentous bands; producing so firm a union, that they can only be sepa- rated by the same violence as would fracture the bones. Synarthrosis is subdivided into several varieties: such as the serrated and squamous suture, harmonia, schindylesis, gomphosis, and synchrondrosis. The serrated, or true suture, is where the edges of the bones are dove-tailed into one another, by means of irregular projections and corresponding indentations, which are most prominent at their external surfaces, as is seen in the junction of the parietal bones. The squamous, or false suture, is formed by the edge of one bone overlapping that of another, while the two surfaces thus approximated are slightly grooved instead of serrated : for instance, the temporal and parietal bones. Harmonia constitutes the mode by which most of the bones of the face are united. Here the surfaces arc only in juxta position, but present slight irregularities which are fitted to each other; or when two edges are brought together, there is a slight overlapping.

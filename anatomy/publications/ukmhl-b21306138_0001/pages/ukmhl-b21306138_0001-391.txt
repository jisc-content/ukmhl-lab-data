GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. O B 2 opinions I have road, and from my own observations and inspection of fresh and boiled muscular fibre, I feel disposed to believe, with Meckel, that the muscles are solid, and pro- bably composed of the fibrine of the bood, modified by the vessels which arc destined to deposit this peculiar structure. 'I'he red colour of the muscular fibres in vertebral animals is g-onerally attributed to the blood; because, in exposing- mus- cle to a running stream, the colour disappears as the blood is washed away; but the circumstance of their paleness in the amphibia, and also their perfect whiteness in red-blooded worms, proves that their colour depends upon something besides the blood. It has been supposed by some to result from the aromatic constituent of the muscle, termed osmazome. The cellular membrane of the muscles is a soft spongy tissue, which not only affords them a general covering of greater or less density, but envelopes every fasciculus, and, ultimately, every fibre, and also fills up the interstices between its separate divisions; forming here, as in every part of the body, the great medium of connexion as well as separation: nor is this the only use it affords to the muscular system, for its cells secrete an albuminous fluid, which, together with a considerable quantity of fat, tend to lubricate their surfaces, and necessarily facilitate their motions. An adipose membrane is also found surrounding the mus- cles : at certain periods of life it only covers them externally, being between them and the skin; while, at later periods, it is found between the fasciculi which compose the muscle; and, in old age, between the very fibres themselves. The tendinous fibres, which are connected with those of the muscles, appertain chiefly to the external or locomotive mus- cles, and form the medium of their connexion to the bones: these fibres are easily distinguishable from the fleshy fibres, being of a white silvery lustre, and not possessing any con- tractile power: they belong to the fibrous system of the body; and their organization, physical properties, and general cha- racters will be described when treating particularly of that

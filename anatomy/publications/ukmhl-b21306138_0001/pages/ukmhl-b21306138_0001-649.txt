Cellular membrane, so named from the peculiarity of its structure, is composed of numerous bluish g’rey fibres, crossing- each other in every direction so as to form thin elastic membranes or plates, which unite, and intersect each other, producing- innumerable cells or areolae, of various shapes and dimensions. This structure is one of the most important in the human body, both on account of its forming- a principal component of every other part, and of the extensive function it performs as an org-an of secretion and absorption. The cellular membrane may, indeed, be reg-arded as the general basis whereon the other structures are formed, and by which they are supported and connected with each other. Some physiologists have considered all membranous structures as so many modifications of the cellular mem- brane ; while others have divided the cellular membrane into numerous distinct tissues : of these views, it appears to be too theoretical, on the one hand, to say that the cellular tissue, by being condensed, forms the cutis, which has the power of depositing concrete lamellae upon its surface, named the cuticle; or, that coiled into tubes, it forms blood- vessels, &c.: so also, on the other hand, it appears to be a useless multiplication of parts, to divide the cellular mem- brane into the numerous tissues described by Bichat. In its general distribution throughout the body, some variety may be observed in the different features represented in its physical properties, and function ; from which circum- stance, for tbe facility of description, it may be considered under the following heads:—

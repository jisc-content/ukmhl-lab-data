VIll PREFACE. leaves to his class a source of reference, conceived in the same terms and arranged in the same order as VFhen delivered from the anatomical chair;—cal- culated, therefore, from that circumstance alone, vividly to impress as well as to strengthen the memory of the student. In a work of this kind, of which the express ob- ject is utility—not fame,—he has not thought it necessary to indicate by formal reference, the many authors from whom he has obviously derived assist- ance : but the names of Bell, Meckell, Bichat, Bedard, Boyer—accomplished writers and practical and profound anatomists—will not, on that account, rise less readily to the reader’s mind. In conclusion, the author trusts—humble as his labours are—that they will not be found wholly unserviceable to anatomical students generally. It is not the first time that he has ventured to appear before the public on subjects of this description; and they have occupied much time spent in diligent research, and active and laborious examination. It is his purpose, in each succeeding season, to publish an annual volume, until the series of these lectures shall be completed. London, 1829.

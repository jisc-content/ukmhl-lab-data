160 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. The Middle Cuneiform Bone Is the smallest of the three; it is situated at the anterior part of the middle of the tarsus, and is divided into four articular surfaces, a base, and an aj)ex. Its posterior arti- cular surface is concave, and broader above than below, to be articulated with the middle part of the os navieulare. Its anterior surface is convex, and is articulated with the posterior extremity of the metatarsal bone of the second toe. The internal face has a smooth flat surface above and behind, by which it is in contact with the internal cuneiform bone; and a small roug’h fossa below, for the attachment of ligament. The external surface is sUghtly hollowed, where it is contiguous to the external cuneiform bone. The base is nearly quadralateral, but rather longer than broad, slightly convex from side to side, is situated on the dorsum of the foot, is rough and penetrated by numerous foramina. The apex is very thin, passes into the sole of the foot, and assists, from its wedge-like form, in producing the transverse arch. Attachment of Muscles.—The m. tibialis posticus is partly attached to this bone. The External Cuneiform Bone. In shape'it somewhat resembles the preceding, but is longer from before to behind; it is larger than the middle, but not so large as the internal cuneiform bone; it has its base placed above, and its apex below, and presents five articular sur- faces. Its base, or superior surface, is rough, longer than it is broad, and forms a part of the dorsum of the foot. Its apex, which is thin, passes into the sole of the foot. The anterior articular surface is flat and smooth, to be connected with the metatarsal bone of the third toe. The posterior face is inclined somewhat inwards, to be ar- ticulated with the navicular bone.

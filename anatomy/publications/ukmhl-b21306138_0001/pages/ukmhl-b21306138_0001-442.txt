DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. the view. There is yet connected with these parts a most important vessel to be observed, the epigastric artery, which is given off'by the external iliac artery close to Poupartâ€™s ligament, passes upwards towards the umbilicus, behind the pubic portion of the fascia transversalis, and conse- ' quently behind the cord, and may be seen just on the inner side of the internal ring ; the cord, at this point, being on its outer side. (Vide Plate I. 3.J It is the knowledge of the relative situation of this artery, which renders the division of the stricture in inguinal hernia safe ; whereas, ignorance of it,=may lead to fatal consequences. The protrusion of any of the abdominal viscera through either or both of the rings, is termed an inguinal hernia; but these displacements do occur under such different circum- stances, as to have led surgeons to divide inguinal hernia into different species, naming them variously; partly in consequence of their direction, partly from their situation, and partly in reference to their relative position with the epigastric artery. The most common kind is termed oblique inguinal hernia ; or, by some anatomists, external inguinal. The first name describing its oblique course, and the se- cond its being situated on the outer side of the epigastric artery. This hernia passes through the internal ring, bringing with it a portion of peritoneum, which is called the hernial sac ; it forms a small tumour in the inguinal canal, and has a tendency to protrude in the course of the cord, meeting in that direction with the least resistance, and progressively makes its way towards the external ring, having the cord placed behind it; while in this situation, between the two rings and within the inguinal canal, this swelling is termed bubonocele. If the swelling can be pushed back into the abdomen, the hernia is called a reducible one, if not, an irreducible one; and, lastly, if vomiting, and the usual symptoms laid down in books of surgery, point out that the intestinal canal in this part is rendered impervious by stricture, then it is called a strangulated bubonocele; and

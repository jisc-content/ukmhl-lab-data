50 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. is inserted. During the foetal period, this muscle seems to take its course upwards along with the gubernaculum, through the internal ring, and may therefore be considered as aiding, if not producing the descent of the testicle ; this idea, perhaps, may be further strengthened by the fact, that there are no corresponding muscular fibres in the female. The'eremaster muscle forms one of the coverings in inguinal hernia in the male, and its fibres are in these cases some- times found very much thickened; it compresses and draws the testicles upwards towards the external ring. The reflected muscles should now be placed in their rela- tive situations, and the remaining muscles of the abdomen may be dissected by making an incision from the junction of the cartilage of the eighth with the seventh rib downwards to the spinous process of the pubes ; by this incision you divide the anterior layer of the sheath of the rectus midway be- tween the linea alba and semilunaris, and expose the Musculus rectus abdominis, which is a long flat muscle passing vertically in the anterior and middle part of the abdomen; arising by tendon from the fore part of the pubes, it ascends, becoming broader and thinner, to be inserted into the ensiform cartilage, and into the cartilages of the three inferior true ribs. In this extent, the rectus muscle is not composed of one uninterrupted course of muscular fibre, but is divided by the three tendinous intersections of the hneae transversse; which have been before described as passing from the lineae semilunares to the linea alba. The rectus muscle on either side is enclosed within an aponeu- rotic sheath, which has been explained by the account given of the insertion of the oblique and transverse museles of the abdomen; namely, that the whole of the tendon of the ex- ternal oblique and half of the tendon of the internal pass in front of the rectus muscle to be inserted into the linea alba; while the posterior half of the internal oblique, and all of the tendon of the transversalis abdominis passes be- hind it, excepting in the space below the point, midway between the umbilicus and os pubis, where all the tendons

266 GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. spleen, stomach, intestines, and bladder; and, most abun- dantly, at those parts where the peritoneum is separated from each organ to allow the passage of their vessels and nerves; as is seen between the folds of the omenta, mesentery, ligaments of the liver, and more especially on that portion of the bladder which is not covered with peri- toneum. In the thorax, the cellular membrane will be found connecting the lungs with their pleura, and the heart with its pericardium; and as in the abdomen, is found more abundant where the serous membranes are reflected from their organs for the transmission of blood-vessels, as in the mediastina, and course of the coronary vessels to the heart. It may be further mentioned here, that the mucous as well as the serous membranes, are attached to their respective organs by a general connecting medium of cellular mem- brane. The second general distribution of the cellular mambrane, is that in which it forms so material a part of all the minute structures of the body. So extensive is this distribution, that the physiologist is unable to say where this structure ends, and other structures commence. In the muscles we find it, after coating them generally, enclosing their separate fasciculi, becoming thinner and thinner in its texture, as it enters more minutely into the body of each fasciculus, enclosing the minutest fibre traceable with the highest magnifying powers. With regard to the blood-vessels, it forms a general covering, readily discerned in the larger branches ; and when we consider the extent of the cellular membrane accompa- nying them to their ultimate ramifications, we are lost in the contemplation of its infinite minuteness and delicacy; and this is still further evinced, when we consider that a much finer layer of cellular membrane connects the internal with the muscular coat of the arteries. The same observations apply to the distribution of the cellular membrane accompa- nying the nervous system ; we are enabled to trace it in the

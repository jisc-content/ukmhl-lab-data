GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. 267 larg-er nerves giving them a strong and general covering, as in the muscles; it then incloses their minuter fasciculi, and subdivides, accompanying them to their minutest fila- ments. The cellular membrane covering the absorbents is very abundant; but in close contact with the vessel, it is short and dense, and not so easily traced as in the arteries and nerves. The same remark applies to the veins; but there, however, it is more distinct than in the absorbents, from the structure of the coats of the vessels. In the substance of the glands, we find the cellular membrane less abundant, and composed of very short and delicate fibres, apparently coating the minute globules of their interior structure ; this may be easily seen by tearing the substance of the liver and spleen, when minute and semitransparent fibres will be seen to separate themselves from between each globule, apparently uniting as well as surrounding them. This cel- lular structure of the liver is rendered particularly obvious by placing a portion in pyrolignious acid, and allowing it to remain for six weeks or two months subjected to its action ; a species of decomposition will take place, by which each distinct globule is detached, and the structure of the liver beautifully demonstrated. The minute, or ultimate structure of cellular membrane, is not clearly understood; by the assistance of the micro- scope we may trace innumerable whitish grey fibres, crossing each other in all directions, and by their union forming thin delicate membranes or plates; these again meet and inter- sect each other, so as to produce cells or areolte. Whether these whitish fibres are blood-vessels, absorbents, or nerves, is not known, excepting from the evidence of secretion and absorption, abundantly carried on in this structure 5 which lunctions lead to the conclusion, that it must be plentifully supplied with such vessels. With regard to the texture of the cellular tissue, it is extremely elastic ; its cohesive force, however, varies; being that of a coagulated liquid in some parts of the body, whilst

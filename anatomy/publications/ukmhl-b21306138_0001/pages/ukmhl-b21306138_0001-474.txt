88 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, The ute of this part of the muscle is the same precisely as the genio hyoideus. Tlie lower jaw, by this last set of muscles, being depressed, it may be well to consider the mouth opened, for the purpose of talcing in food, that we may be enabled physiologically to describe the muscles as they present themselves to view in this dissection, according to the function they are destined to perform in the process of mastication and deglutition ; and first of these the four muscles of mastication, or those Avhich raise the lower jaw, and close the mouth. Before deseribing- the origin and insertion of the temporal musele, its aponeurotic covering must be spoken of. This aponeurosis arises upon the lateral surface of the skull, from a white arched line, which extends on the frontal parietal and temporal bones ; or may be considered as a continuation of the epicranial fascia: it proceeds downwards to the zygo- matic arch, and is attached to the whole length of its upper border, in its course splitting into two portions, the inner of which passes between the fibres of the temporal musele, so as to divide them into a superficial and deep set, the super- ficial being the most attenuated. The m. temporalisâ€”arises from the inner surface of the temporal fascia, and from the whole length of the white arched line which extends over the frontal, parietal and tem- poial bones, forming the boundary of the temporal fossa; from these points of origin the fibres pass downwards, con- verging as from the circumference to the centre of a circle, and opposite the zygomatic arch, terminating in a very strong tendon, which descends vertically to the coronoid process of the lower jaw, into the whole of which it is inserted. The external surface of this muscle is fleshy, the internal ten- dinous, and particularly at the lower part, just as it is passing to be inserted. The temporal muscle is covered externally by its aponeurosis, by the anterior and levator muscles of the ear, which arise from the temporal fascia, and also by the zygomatic arch; its internal surface covers first the tem- poral fossa formed by the bones of the head, the pterygoideus externus muscle being only separated from it by fat, and the internal maxillary artery. The anterior fibres of this muscle, which pass from the frontal temporal fossa, are on a plane.

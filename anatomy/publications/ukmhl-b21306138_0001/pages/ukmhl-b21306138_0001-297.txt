DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 235 Motions of the Humerus on the Scapula. These motions are not only various in direction, but also very extensive, in consequence of the independent mobility of the scapula. The humerus is capable of being raised or depressed, car- ried backwards ox forwards, inwards or outwards; of being rotated; and a combination of all these directions, which is termed circumduction. Hence it is obvious that numerous muscles serve to perform these dilferent motions, and which, it must be remembered, add much to the strength of the arti- culation, and prevent, therefore, the frequent occurrence of displacement. When the humerus is raised to its fullest extent, the head of the bone slides from the upper to the lower part of the glenoid cavity, and presses against the inferior part of the capsular ligament, while its raised shaft is opposed to the acromion process of the scapula; it is in this position that dislocation is most likely to occur; for if any force should propel the humerus backwards, the head of the bone is driven through the lower part of the capsular ligament. In depression of the shoulder, the head of the humerus is drawn from the glenoid cavity, and the capsular ligament and tendon of the biceps muscle are put upon the stretch, which restrain the depression beyond a certain extent, unless the force be sufficient to tear these structures. When the arm is directed behind, the head of the humerus is pressed forward against the capsular ligament, but which is at this part so strengthened by tbe tendons of the spinati subscapu- laris muscles, and the deltoid, that the extent of motion, in this direction, is less than when the arm is carried either for- wards or upwards, although this movement is much increased by the mobility of the scapula. In the forward direction of the arm, the articular surface of the humerus remains in contact with the glenoid cavity of the scapula, unless, at the same time, tbe arm be directed

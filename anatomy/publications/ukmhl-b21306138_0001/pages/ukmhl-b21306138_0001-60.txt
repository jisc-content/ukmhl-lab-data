LECTURE II. THE BONES OF THE HEAD. Description of the Skeleton. W^HEN the bones of any animal are placed in situ, and deprived of their soft parts, the whole is called a skeleton which is termed natural or artificial, as they happen to be attached to each other by their own ligaments or by wires. The artificial skeleton is best adapted for anatomical ob- servation, as it admits of the motion of the limbs, and there- fore is more suited to give a just idea of their uses. The human skeleton has a strong resemblance to the figure of the body, and conveys at one glance a just idea how admirably it is adapted to its particular uses, especially in regard to the defence which it afibrds to the vital organs. It presents two large cavities:—the superior one, produced by the flat bones of the skull, prolonging itself through the vertebral canal, lodges the whole of the central parts of the nervous system: while the large anterior cavity, formed by the bones of the thorax and pelvis, sufficiently guards the organs for respiration and nutrition. To facilitate the description, it is convenient to make of the skeleton three principal divisions:—head, trunk, and extremities—each of which are composed of several bones, so arranged as readily to indicate the functions for which they are destined. The head is subdivided into the bones of the cranium and face, which will hereafter be particularly described. The trunk is subdivided into the bones of the spine, chest, and pelvis. The third division of the skeleton, the extremities, are

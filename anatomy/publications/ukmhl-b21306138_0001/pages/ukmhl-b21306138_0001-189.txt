133 BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES, admits of extensive motion; this must, indeed, be admitted, l)ut the ex- ception is readily accounted for, the trapezium being the only carpal bone directly connected with a digital phalanx; for I am disposed to contend, with some French anatomists, that the formation, connexion, and functions of that joint, all tend to prove that what is commonly, I believe, erroneously called the metacarpal bone, ought more properly to be regarded as the first phalanx of the thumb. The Metacarpal Bones. These are usually described as consisting’ of five in number; but in consequence of the thumb being’ articulated with the carpus, in a manner quite peculiar to itself, we may with propriety consider the thumb as being" formed of three phalang’es, while the remaining" fingers have intervening be- tween them and the carpus, the four metacarpal bones. When entering into further detail of the functions of the hand, in my lecture on the skeleton, other reasons will be adduced for the propriety of this arrangement. The four metacarpal bones form the second division of the bones of the hand, and are situated between the wrist and the fingers. Tliey resemble each other in being cylindrical, consisting of a body and two extremities ; the superior, upper, or carpal extremity, being termed the base, is flattened and covered with cartilage, for their attachment to the carpus, and rough anteriorly and posteriorly, for the insertion of the carpo-metacarpal ligaments. The inferior, or digital ex- tremities, are convex from before to behind, and flattened laterally, thus constituting the head which is covered with cartilage: where the head of the bone is connected to the body, it is contracted, forming the neck, which is bounded in its circumference by small rough tubercles, for the attachment of the metacarpo phalangeal ligaments: — while the in- tervening portion of bone, termed the body, is broad on its dorsal surface, concave on its palmar aspect, and flattened laterally; but although they much resemble one another, each presents certain peculiarities requiring individual description.

276 GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE, fowls, which, in proportion as they are fattened, are less capable of laying- eg-g-s. The circumstances which diminish the tendency to the formation of fat, are violent exercise, great activity of mind and body, abstinence, and increased perspiration. A dis- eased state of the vital organs, and more especially those of digestion, occasions a rapid absorption of fat. There are sometimes partial accumulations of fat, forming very large tumours, in various situations of the body, but most commonly under the skin; these are termed stea- tometa ; they are generally of a rounded form, communic-ate a doughy feel to the touch, and are perfectly free from pain, producing no other inconvenience than from their weight. Such tumours are sometimes placed between the peritoneum and abdominal muscles, where they are of more importance, from their pressure on the viscera. They are enclosed by a cellulous envelope, occasionally of considerable thickness, and containing blood-vessels, which are in proportion to the size of the tumour; although at the same time these tumours have fewer and smaller vessels than any other. The adeps contained in these tumours appears the same in every respect as healthy fat in other parts of the body, unless it be found somewhat more consolidated from pres- sure. In old persons, the muscles are occasionally filled with fat, and are of a white colour; whence has arisen the supposition, that they have changed into fat; but this is never the case, as the fibrous structure of the muscle, although altered in appearance, always remains. In local inflammation, where the adipose tissue is most abundant, gangrene frequently occurs, from the little vitality of this structure; this is frequently seen in large umbilical herniae, where portions of fat omentum are left in the sac, when it is found readily to sphacelate ; and a consi- derable quantity of adeps escapes in a fluid state, leaving the membrane behind, which is slower in its ulcerative process of separation ; but sometimes remains as an org-an- ized part within the sac.

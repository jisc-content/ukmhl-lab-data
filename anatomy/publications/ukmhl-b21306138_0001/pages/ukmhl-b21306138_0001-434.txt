^18 DESCHIPTIVK ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, tendinous, and is connected with the external oblique mus- cle ; but here the tendon of the internal oblique splits into two layers, the anterior of which, with the tendon of the external oblique, passes in front of the rectus muscle to be inserted into the whole length of the Unea alba ,* while the posterior layer, accompanied by the tendon of the transver- salis muscle, passes behind the rectus to the same insertion, excepting at its lower fourth, where it is said to pass in front, but should rather be described as becoming here so atte- nuated as to be lost in cellular membrane. Those fibres of the muscle arising from the outer part of Poupart’s ligament form a tendon which pass in front of the spermatic cord, behind the external ring, and is inserted into the symphisis pubes, being connected intimately with a similar tendon of the transversalis muscle. Use.—The use of this muscle is to assist the external oblique muscle of the abdomen in all its actions; but it is to be remembered, tliat the internal oblique of the one side, cooperates with the external oblique of the other, in producing the rotatory motions of the trunk. To expose the third layer of the abdominal muscle, the internal oblique muscle should be raised from the cartilages of the ribs, from the fascia lumborum and from the crista of the ilium as far forwards as the anterior and superior spinous process ; immediately below which point it is so strongly ad- herent to the transversalis muscle, that care must be taken that its fibres are not raised with it; this may be avoided by observing branches of the circumflexa ilii artery, which are between them: the muscle is then to be reflected as far as the linea semilunaris, the portion arising from Poupart’s ligament being left in its natural situation. The musculus abdominis transversus is thus exposed: it is broader before than behind, fleshy at its superior lateral and inferior aspects, but tendinous at its anterior and posterior surfaces: its exterior is covered by the two last described muscles, while its interior face is in contact with the fascia transversalis, which separates it from the peritoneum; this

LECTURE XIX. DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Muscles of the Lower Extremities. The combined actions of the muscles of the lower extre- mities, being" highly important as the principal agents of loco- motion, I shall now proceed to mention several particulars respecting them. The lower extremities present a remarkable difference from the upper, in being destined to support the great weight of the body, at the same time they have to perform their several motions. The perfection of this combined func- tion, in the structure of the joints of the lower extremities, and which so admirably contributes to the erect position in man; is a principal feature, which renders him superior to all other animals. The erect posture is maintained by the muscles of the head being inserted into the bones of the spine ; the muscles of the spine, receiving their fixed point from the bones of the pelvis; the muscles of the pelvis, from the femora and upper part of the hones of the leg; the muscles of the thigh, from the leg and foot; and the muscles of the leg, from the foot: thus the erect position of the body is the result of the united action of the muscles of these several regions. Standing in the erect posture on both legs, the centre of gravity will fall in an imaginary perpendicular line between the two; but if the pressure be not equal on both legs, the centre of gravity will fall to that side on which the pressure is greatest, and a degree of obliquity is given to the position of the body. It is necessary to remember, that this change of the centre of gravity constantly occurs in every new

69 BONES OF THE HEAD. of the bones which enter into its composition. Contained in this division we have the track of the grooves for lodging the lateral sinuses: which, beginning at the internal tuberosity of the occipital bone, pass successively over the occipital, posterior angle of the parietal, mastoid portion of the tempo- ral, and again on the occipital bone, to terminate in the foramina lacera basis cranii posteriora. The foramen magnum, which is situated in the median line, is proper to the occipital bone, and admits the spinal marrow, its membranes, and also the spinal arteries: it admits, like- wise, the vertebral arteries, accessory nerves, and sinus venosus. On each side of this foramen are situated the an- terior condyloid foramina, which open on the external base of the skull, between the condyloid processes and the fora- mina lacera. The foramina lacera basis cranii posteriora are produced by two sulci, formed into foramina by the junc- tion of the temporal and occipital bones : they are situated on the outer and fore part of the foramen magnum, and appear externally between the anterior condyloid foramina, the fossae jugulares and styloid processes of the terrjporal bones. The posterior condyloid may be seen opening into these lacerated foramina on the external base of the skull, for the purpose of admitting veins which pass through these openings, to terminate in the lateral sinuses. The foramina lacera basis cranii posteriora transmit the internal jugular veins, which are situated to the outer side of the accessory, gtosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves, which also pass out of these openings : a small artery enters them, to supply the dura mater. On the posterior surface of the temporal bones, three foramina are to be observed: the principal of these are nearest to the median line, and are called ihe fora- mina auditiva interna: they take a direction outwards, and shghtly backwards, into the substance of the temporal bones, but soon divide into two passages: one, the apparent continu- ation of the foramen, passes to the base of the modiolus, and allows of the passage of the auditory nerve, or portio mollis, into the labyrinth : while the other take.s its course upwards, F 2

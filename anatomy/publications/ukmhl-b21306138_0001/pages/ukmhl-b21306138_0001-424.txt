LECTURE Xm. DliSCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Introductory Remarks. In the arrang-ement or classification of the muscles, the object is in the clearest manner to direct the student to a thorough knowledg-e of this system, both anatomically and physiolog’ically; but in this a considerable difl&culty arises from the impossibility of arrang’ing’ them so as equally to facilitate the mode of investig-ating’ them by dissection, and classifying them according to their uses. It has already been shewn that the muscular system, from the peculiar power it has of contraction, serves to give motion to every part to which it is attached: physiologically, therefore, mus- cles might be arranged according to their respective uses: as those which act especially upon the osseous system, those which move soft parts, and those, the object of which is to assist other organs in the performance of their respective functions. Now, to adhere to such a description of the muscular system, would be to assume what cannot by any means be conceded—that each muscle, or set of muscles, performs a single and exclusive function; and that every individual purpose is effected by a particular muscle, or set of muscles. But although such assumptions prove appli- cable to machinery, formed by ingenuity of man, they are found altogether at variance with the wisdom and power displayed in the construction of the living human body. No such singleness of purpose is here to be found; but, on the contrary, by an equally wonderful and beautiful contrivance, an individual muscle, or a partial set of muscles, is made subservient to a variety of important objects: thus we have

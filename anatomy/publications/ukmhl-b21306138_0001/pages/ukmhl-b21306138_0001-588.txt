9 202 DESCRimVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. The m. sartorius—is the long-est muscle in the body, and crosses the thigli from without inwards in a serpentine di- reetion 5 it arises by short aponeurotic fibres from the ante- rior and superior spinous process of the ilium, soon becomes fleshy, and passes obliquely downwards and inwards along- the upper third of the thig-h; it is then directed vertically towards the back part of the inner condyle, where it ag-ain alters its course by passing- forwards and outwards to be inserted by a flat tendon into the inner side of the tibia, immediately below its tubercle 5 this tendon also expands into an aponeurosis, which is connected wdth the fascia of the leg-. The sartorius, anteriorly, is covered by the fascia lata; it arises between the tensor vag-inae femoris and iliacus ; in its passag-e downwards to its insertion, it successively covers the psoas, iliacus, rectus, cruraeus, and vasti muscles; then reaching- the triceps adductor femoris, runs for some way parallel with, and between it and the gracilis; in the middle of the thigh it crosses the femoral vessels ; and lastly, the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint. In its upper third its internal edge forms the outer boundary of a triangular space between it and the adductor longus, in which the femoral vessels and nerve are placed. It is this space wherein the femoral artery is usually secured in j cases of popliteal aneurism ; and the sartorius muscle is <| the guide for the incision which exposes its sheath. ' Use.'—To flex the leg- upon the thigh, and direct it across the opposite extremity ; if still kept in action, it assists the flexion of the thigh upon the pelvis ; it slightly rotates the leg outwards. The m. gracilis—^arises from the anterior surface of the body of the pubes, from the descending ramus of that bone, and the ascending ramus of the ischium; from these origins itq)asses vertically downwards on the inner side of the thigh, becoming narrower as it descends ; and at about the junc- tion of the middle with the lower third of the thigh, forms a round tendon, which passes behind the internal condyle, and is insert^ into the inner and upper part of the tibia, below

GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 4 and, in warm-blooded animals, of a red colour. But upon a more minute examination as the muscle lies in masses in a relative position, or investigating- it more closely when se- parated from the body, it is found to be composed, not of one homogenious structure, but of three distinct tissues:— fleshy fasciculi, tendinous fibres, and cellular membrane; each of which structures is essential to the function of the mus- cular system, although to one only of them is attributable that contractile power which marks vital property; and to these may be added,—arteries, veins, nerves, and absorbents. The fleshy fibres of the muscles are disposed in fasciculi, which are placed by the side of each other, and never intersect: these fasciculi are separable into fibres, these again into smaller fibrillse, and even these may be subdivided until you expose what has been termed the ultimate fibre, which is so small as only to be visible by the aid of a microscope, but which some believe to be of itself only indivisible for the want of delicacy of manipulation and niceness of instru- ments. There are physiologists who maintain that the pri- mitive fibres, as they have been called, are of considerable length, and extend, in many muscles, from their tendinous origin to their tendinous insertion ; this opinion, however, is not generally believed; on the contrary, it is thought that each of these lengthened fasciculi is made up of a number of the ultimate fibres connected with each other at their extremities through the medium of the cellular membrane. The difficulty of ascertaining the true structure and or- ganization of the ultimate fibre of a muscle may be supposed, when it is estimated as not surpassing one two-thousandth part of an inch in diameter; and therefore, on this point, a great difference of opinion exists: some affirming that it is solid, and consists of a substance resembling the fibrine* of the blood, enclosed in a reticulated membrane; otlrers, that it is a hollow cylinder: again, that ithey are composed of rounded corpuscles, placed like a series of pearls, connected by cellular tissue: but it seems too true, that their real struc- ture has not been ascertained; although, from the different

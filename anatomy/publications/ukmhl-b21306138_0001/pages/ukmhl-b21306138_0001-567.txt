DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 181 already g'iven, extravasations extend in these directions, and not within the cavity of the pelvis. The circumstance most frequently rendering- operations necessary in this part is, retention of urine from an imper- vious state of the urethra, through which instruments cannot be passed ; in such cases the urethra is oblig-ed to be opened throug-h the perinmum; or the bladder punctured above the pubes, or per rectum. The detailed circumstances rendering such operations necessary, and the mode of performing them, more properly belong to a work professedly on sur- gery. I shall however here remark two cases of considera- ble peculiarity and practical utility. In both of these cases insuperable retention of urine existed, attended with abscess in the perinaeum; and, from the history of the cases, it was reasonable to suppose rupture of the urethra had occurred. In the first case, after the matter had been evacuated, I opened the urethra, passed a female catheter into the bladder, and drew off the urine ; having done this, I proceeded to pass a male catheter along the natural passage, and to my surprise found that the canal was pervious, and that the retention had been occasioned entirely by the pressure of the matter. In the second case, the same insurmountable difficulty in the passage of the instrument occurred, and I was obhg'ed to proceed as in the first case as far as the evacuation of the matter; after which the water was drawn off through the natural passage without further difficulty. It appeared that, in these cases, the collection of matter pressed the urethra out of its natural course, and raising it ' above the opening in the triangular ligament caused, in conjunction with it, a duplication of the passage, which was insurmountable. From this history, we learn the propriety, whenever an impervious state of the urethra is concomitant with abscess, of examining the state of the canal after the evacuation of the matter.

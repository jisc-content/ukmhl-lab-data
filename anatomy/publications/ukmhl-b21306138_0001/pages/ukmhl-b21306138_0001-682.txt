29(J GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. tlie duet may g-enerally be discovered, and a probe pushed into the sac ; after which it may be emptied of its contents: but when they are very larg'e, it is necessary to remove the sac, to ensure a radical cure. The varieties of colour of the skin may, perhaps, be considered entirely to depend upon the development and function of the rete rnucosum; and there seems to be no circumstance which tends more to strengthen this suppo- sition, than the facts connected with that peculiarity of colour constituting- what is termed the Albino. In them the colour is a dull reddish white, the hair nearly colourless, and the eye red; these appearances are supposed by some physiolog-ists to depend upon the absence of the rete mu- cosura, and pig-mentum nigrum of the choroid coat of the eye. Whether this state is to be considered as disease, or malformation at birth, is yet a matter of doubt; the reg-u- larity of the other functions of the body, notwithstanding- the greater susceptibility of the eye to light, and the diminished power of function in the skin, shews rather that this pecu- liarity is not depending on disease. This peculiarity is a variety which occurs among all races of mankind, and appears to be the same in white rabbits, and many other animals. There are certain spots which occasionally occur in the skin, on different parts of the body, w'hich, upon dissection, shew a darker structure of rete mucosum. I am inclined to consider those patches which are termed aneurisms by anas- taraoses, as depending upon a varicose state of the vessels of the rete mucosum; particularly from the ready manner in which they are fed from neighbouring vessels, as it were from a net-work, and which cannot be cured without the total eradication of the whole mass. Some of the appearances in melanosis, also lead me to suspect, that they have some reference to a diseased function in the rete mucosum. The cuticle appears to be variously diseased, and different views have been formed by those wdio consider it as merely

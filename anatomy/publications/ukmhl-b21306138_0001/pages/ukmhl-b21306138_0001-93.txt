51 BONES OF THE HEAD. Connexion.—The superior edge connects them with the os frontis, formings a part of the transverse suture ; the posterior edge with the orbitar process of the ethmoid bone; the anterior edge with the nasal process of the superior maxillary; and the inferior edge with the orbitar process of the same bone. Within the nose these bones are slightly connected to the inferior turbinated bone ; forming there, with the as- sistance of the superior maxillary bone, the ductus ad nasum. There are no muscles attached to them. Practical Points. The texture as well as the situation of this bone is important to the surgeon, especially in reference to fistula lachrymalis. In this disease, the delicate structure of the bone suggests the propriety of an early open- ing, to evacuate the matter; and requires caution, in the performance of the operation for its radical cure. The use of this bone is sufficiently implied by its description. The Ossa Malarum Are the square prominent bones which form the cheeks : their external surface is convex and smooth—their internal surface is concave. These bones, anteriorly, form the cheeks; posteriorly, they join the temporal bones ; and, superiorly, enter into the composition of the orbit. The form of these bones is an irregular square, and they may be divided into three distinct parts or surfaces, which will point out both their position and use. They present a superior or orbital surface, an external or facial surface, a posterior or temporal surface; but each of these parts is subdivided by processes which are to be described. The superior or orbital portion of the bone is semilunar in its form, and terminates by two cornua: the superior one is rough, to be connected with the frontal bone, just at the outer and superior part of the orbit, and is termed the superior orbitar process: the inferior cornu is also roughened, to form a similar junction with the superior maxillary bone, and

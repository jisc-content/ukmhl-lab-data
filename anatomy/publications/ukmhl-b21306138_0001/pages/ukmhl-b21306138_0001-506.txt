120 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. inserted tendinous into the asperity on the middle and outer part of the radius, immediately below the supinator radii brevis. This muscle at its origin has the flexor carpi radialis on its inner side, with'which it is blended, and the tendon of the biceps and brachialis internus on its outer side, as they are passing to their insertions, also the brachial artery and median nerve: the anterior surface Is covered above by the skin and aponeurosis of the fore arm, at its insertion by the supinator radii longus, the radial extensors ‘of the wrist, and the radial artery and nerve ; it lies upon the brachialis internus and flexor sublimis muscles, median nerve and ulna artery. Use.—To roll the radius upon the ulna, and thus to render the hand prone. The m. flexor carpi radialis—arises narrow and tendinous from the fore part of the internal condyle of the humerus, also-from the outer and back part of the coronoid process of the ulna, and from intermuscular tendon; it then pro- ceeds fleshy downwards and obliquely outwards ; and at the lower third of the fore arm it forms a strong tendon, which passes under the annular ligament, through a groove in the os trapezium, to be inserted into the base of the fore part of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. At its origin this muscle is placed between the pronator radii teres on its outer side, and palmaris longus on its inner, between which muscles it passes downwards towards its insertion 5 and having gained the point of insertion of the pronator radii teres, it has to its radial side the supinator radii longus, and the radial artery and nerve; it is superfi- cial in its whole course, until it passes into the hand, and there becomes covered by the annular ligament and muscles proper to the thumb; it lies upon the flexor sublimis, flexor longus pollici and wrist-joint. Use.—Witli all the muscles inserted either into the bones of the carpus or metacarpus, to move the wrist-joint, which it flexes and slightly prouates.

138 DJiSCRIPnVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. muscles occupying' the spaces between the metacarpal bones, termed the interossei; which, being inserted into the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum, I have classified collec- tively as one of the five muscles common to the fingers, under the name of the short extensor to the fingers. Four of these muscles will be found situated on the palmar, and three on the dorsal region of the hand. Those on the palm are termed the interossei interni, and are disposed in the following manner: two pass to be inserted into the index finger, one into the ring, and the fourth into the little finger. Beginning from the outer side, the first of these muscles to be dissected, is The m, prior inclicis—arises from the radial side of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger, and from a small portion of the first phalanx of the thumb; these fasciculi, being separated from each other, admit the passage of the radial artery between them ; they soon, however, unite and pass to be inserted principally into the extensor tendon of the index finger, and also into the root of the first phalanx. Posteriorly, this muscle is only covered by the skin of the back of the hand; anteriorly it is concealed by the first lumbricalis muscle, and the muscles proper to the thumb. Use.—To assist in extending the fore finger, also to abduct it, and to draw the first phalanx of the thumb towards the metacarpal bone of the fore finger. The m. posterior indicis—arises from the ulnar side of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger, as far upwards as the ligaments connecting that bone with the trapezoid ; then passing downwards, between the metacarpal bones of the index and middle fingers, passes to be inserted into the extensor tendon and first phalanx of the fore finger. This muscle is covered by the flexor brevis and adductor pollicis. Use.—To assist in extending tlie fore finger ; and, being extended, to adduct it. The m, prior annularis—arises on the radial side of the

295 THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. extremities, progressively diminishes from the earliest periods until adult ag;â€™e; for in the earlier periods of uterine gestation, even in the second month after conception, the head forms a half of the whole length of the body ; a fourth part at birth, about a fifth at the third year; and it amounts only to the eighth part of the whole, when the full growth is accom- plished. In early life the face is small in proportion to the cranium, the thorax in proportion to the pelvis, and the extremities in proportion to the trunk, . The different sexes present also manifest distinctions in their skeletons : thus it is found that the skeleton of the female is more delicate and smaller than that of the male, whether we consider it as a whole, or the bones individually. The thorax of the female skeleton is shorter, smaller, but more moveable ; the pelvis, on the con- trary, is larger, especially in its lateral dimensions ; and the lumbar regions are infinitely elongated. It may be said, in- deed, if a minute comparative view be taken, that not only all die regions of the body, but that almost all the bones present some special differences in the skeletons of the two sexes. , The different races of mankind present also great variety in their skeletons; some of these varieties are, however, at- tributable to the effects produced by artificial contrivances ; as, for instance, the flattened head of the Caribbee, and the distorted foot of the Chinese female. But all varieties of form, which distinguish different races, are not to be ex- plained by the habits alluded to; for a natural difference seems to exist in regard to the form and the dimensions of the cranium, and its proportions to the face: also in the pro- portion of the length of the extremities: in many of the negro race, the upper extremities are large in proportion to the trunk; and the fore arm and the foot are large in proportion to the arm and leg. That there are original national varie- ties of form, is proved by the inspection of the foetus, in which distinguishing peculiarities already appear. But not only is there to be found varieties in the form and

descriitive anatomy of articulations. 249 this lig-ament passes from the ulna to the carpus it becomes attached to the interarticular cartilage, which divides the ligament into an upper and a lower half; the upper portion is covered by the synovial membrane of the inferior radio ulnar articulation, and the lower by the synovial membrane of the radio carpal articulation. Both these last described lig'aments are very strong-, and prevent the displacement of the bones, which might otherwise have been of frequent oc- currence, from the extent of motion to which they are liable. Synovial membrane.—This membrane covers the scaphoid cavity at the lower extremity of the radius, and the under surface of the interarticular cartilag-e; passes anteriorly from these points of attachment to the inner surface of the anterior lig-ament of the wrist-joint, and to the lower half of the in- ternal lateral ligament 5 then passes upon the superior sur- faces of the scaphoid, lunar and cuneiform bones, dippirfg in between each to line their connecting faces, and forming a synovial cavity between them ; ascends upon the posterior ligament, passes sufficiently far outwards to give a hning to the external lateral ligament, and terminates at the point from whence this description began. From these particulars it is clear that there are two joints at the wrist; the one is named the inferior radio ulnar arti- culation, which does not form a joint with the bones of the carpus, but allows the radius to roll upon the ulna, and perform the motions of pronation and supination of the hand, while the radio carpal articulation admits of the motions of flexion and extension, and forms a joint with the three outer bones of the first carpal row ;—'not that the cuneiform bone is in contact with the radius, but that it is still connected with it by the same synovial membrane which is common to the other two bones of the carpus. Previous to describing the ligaments proper to the bones of the carpus, I shall give an account of such as tie down the tendons of those muscles serving for the motions of the hand and fingers, which are found on the dorsal and palmar regions of the wrist, commencing with the palmar region.

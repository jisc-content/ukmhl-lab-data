DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 137 tened, is connected by intermuscular tendon with the flexor brevis minimi digiti, and passes along; the metacarpal bone to reach the ulnar side of the root of the first phalanx, into which it is inserted by a narrow tendon, as well as into the tendinous expansion which covers the dorsal surface of the fing-ers. The palmaris brevis, at its origin, partly covers this muscle. Use.—To draw the first phalanx of the little finger from the other fingers, and assist in extending the second and third phalanges. The m. flexor brevis minimi digiti—arises from the hamillary process of the unciform bone, and from the liga- mentum carpi annulare; it is at first thin, then becomes broader, and terminates by a narrow tendon which is con- nected with that of the abductor muscle, and passes to be inserted into the root of the first phalanx of the little finger. This muscle is covered by the palmaris brevis, lies on the radial side of the abductor minimi digiti, and on the ulna side of the adductor muscle, which it partly covers. Use.—To flex the first phalanx of the little finger, and direct it towards the others. The m. adductor minimi digiti—arises from the os unci- forme, on the radial side and beneath the last muscle, and also from the ligamentum carpi annulare ; it forms a thick fleshy muscle which passes to be inserted along the whole length of the radial side of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and generally into the root of the first phalanx or sesamoid bone, when the little finger is furnished with them. The adductor muscle is covered by the abductor and flexor brevis minimi digiti. Use.—To draw the metacarpal bone of the little finger towards the palm of the hand; and by pressing it against the metacarpal bone of the ring finger, forms the palm into a concavity. All these muscles which have just been described as belonging to the dissection of the palm of the hand, should now be carefully removed, and there will be exposed seven

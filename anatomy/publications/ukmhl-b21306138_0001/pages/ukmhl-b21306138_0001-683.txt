GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. 297 u secretion from the skin, and tliose wlio believe it to possess an independent organization. As a covering to the body, its principal office seems to be, to defend the more sensitive integuments underneath from the action of the atmosphere ; hence the great suffering which is produced merely by tlie loss of a small portion of this protecting medium; and the cause of death in extensive scalds, and burns, appears gene- rally to depend upon the irritation of the air upon the exposed surface, which produces such violent effects, that the con- stitution sinks under it. The peculiar power which the cuticle possesses in resisting the drying effects of the atmos- phere upon the cutis, exists for a considerable length of time, even after death. I placed a piece of skin in the sun, one half of which was denuded of its cuticle, and which dried up into a kind of horny substance, in the course of a few hoprs ; while the other portion, from which the cuticle was not removed, remained for three weeks very little al- tered, the cutis remaining underneath in its natural, soft, and pliant state. The cuticle, the hairs, and the nails, appear to., possess a remarkable variety from all other living structures, in not being absorbed after formation. Nature appears to have provided for this by the constant desquamation of their ex- uberant growths; with respect to the cuticle, in the human subject, this may be readily seen, in those parts where it accumulates in the greatest quaiitity, as in the scalp, feet, palms of the hands, and other parts of the body, from whence it is abundantly detached by friction, and more par- ticularly when separated by warmth and moisture; and in reference to the hair and nails, from the constant necessity of keeping them short by cutting. This separation of cuticle in many reptiles takes place at stated periods, by a general removal from the whole surface; and it is remarkable, that, in such instances, the cuticle is detached from the sur- face of the eye, shewing its transparent formation over that delicate organ; which fact offers an objection to those

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 61 those already described, in not passing- through either of the ring's, but protruding- from underneath Poupart’s lig-a- ment, and forming- a tumour upon the upper part of the thig-h; therefore it becomes necessary to describe the parts upon the upper reg-ion of the thigh, which are connected with this hernia, before it can be comprehended. On re- moving the skin from the anterior part of the upper third of the thigh, we bring into view the superficial fascia, which has been already alluded to as a continuation of the aponeurosis of the external oblique; and immediately below Poupart’s ligament it divides itself into layers enveloping the superficial inguinal glands, and binds them firmly down to the subjacent structure. On removing this fascia and the glands, we expose the fascia lata, a strong aponeurosis giving more intimate covering to the muscles of the thigh. It takes its origin by two distinct portions, which very much resembles the mode by which the transversalis fascia ter- minates, each leaving an open space between the two portions. The outer, or iliac portion of the fascia lata, arises from the whole extent of Poupart’s ligament, passes down- wards upon the thigh, presenting a concave or cresentie edge facing inwards, which, on the outer side, slightly over- laps the sheath of the femoral vessels, and terminates from an inch to an inch and a half below Poupart’s ligament by joining the pubic portion. (Vide Plate I. 4, 4, 4.) The pubic portion proceeds from the spinous process of the pubes from Gimbernat’s ligament and linea ilio peetinea, and from Pou- part’s ligament; situated on a plane posterior to the other, it passes down upon the inner side of the thigh, covering the pectineus muscle, proceeds outwards as far as the femoral sheath (Vide Plate 1.5, 5, 5.^,- there splits into two layers, one of which passes posterior to the sheath, becomes connected with the fascia iliaca and capsular ligament of the hip-joint; the other, passing anterior to the vessels, joins the outer or iliac portion of the fascia lata, as mentioned above: thus a foramen is completed, which admits the termination of the saphena major vein into the femoral vein. Through the whole

3-1 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Tendon, from its physical properties, as its extensibility * and g-reat streng’th, is in the best possible manner adapted to its peculiar function of communicating’ the force of muscle to the bones ; and also from its comparative little vitahty, it is but rarely affected by disease, althoug’h it possesses enoug'h of vital principle to be able to repair itself vrhen ruptured, of which we have frequent examples in rupture of the tendo Achillis. In this case, the ag’g’lutination does not at first enjoy all the properties of tendon ; but in the course of time, when influenced by the action of the muscles, it becomes hardened as the orig-inal tendon. Mr. Charles Bell has likened the construction of tendon to the most perfect mode of rope-making"; and observed, that it is hatchelled, straided and twisted in the same manner: and superadded to this mechanism, it is influenced by a vital principle, which renders it- superior both in strength and adjustment, as well as capable of maintaining its own growth and perfection. Practical Remarks. The diseases of tendons are but few, as indeed might be supposed from their structure and essential physical properties—extensibility and cohesion ; which well qualifies them to transmit the action of the muscles to the passive organs of motion—the bones ; but it is found that they are susceptible of injury, although by some it has been be* lieved that they do not possess nerves and vessels: a strain however, produced by an inordinate action of a muscle upon a tendon, will at once prove the existence of nerves, which are sensible to the undue application of their function; although, when exposed, they are not pained by cutting or rubbing; a mechanical injury to which, in their naturally covered situation, they are not liable; hence the physiolo- gist must infer, that nerves are only susceptible of painful sensation and injury from such causes as, in a less degree, are the natural stimuli to the functions which they are destined to perforin. Puncture and laceration however produce in them swelling and agglutination to sur- sounding parts, which requires a length of time to reduce. The cellular sheaths of tendons are liable to inflammation and to its effects; and if going on to suppuration, the tendons are frequently left bare, but yet remain uninjured.

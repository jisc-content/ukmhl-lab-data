GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 25 solid, and constitute therefore a very considerable portion of the bulk of the human body; they are also of a florid red colour, composed of fasciculi which run parallel to each other, and are usually attached at each extremity to tendons, or some other parts of the fibrous texture, through the medium of which they become connected with the bones. There are but few exceptions in the voluntary muscles to their being found in pairs: the diaphragm and sphincters are considered as these exceptions ; but these are rather to be classed amongst the mixed muscles. The size of the voluntary muscles varies considerably; some being of very large, while others are of the smallest dimensions: and their figure also offers numerous varieties ; some being very long, as those of the extremities; others hroad, as those which cover the cavities; while those which are attached to the irregular bones, are short muscles. The motions which take place in the human body, as produced by the action of the voluntary muscles, are flexion, extension, lateral inclination, rotations toward '■opposite directions, abduction, adduction, elevation, and depres- sion ; and from the performance of these actions have several of the muscles been named; hence the term flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, elevators, &c. They some- times also derive their name from the direction of their fibres, as the obliqui abdominis ; from the number of their origins, as the biceps and triceps; from their figure, as the trapezius; from their formation, as including two distinct fleshy portions divided by an intervening tendon, as the digastrici; from their situation and comparative size, as the pectoralis major and minor; and also from their attachment, as the sterno cleido mastoideus, genio hyo g’lossus, &c. A classification of the muscles of volition has also been attempted, by dividing them into those belonging to the skeleton, to the larynx, to the organs of the senses, and those'of the skin ; and if those of the skeleton be subdivided in the manner of the bones into the long, the flat, and the short, the arrangement will be found, perhaps of all others.

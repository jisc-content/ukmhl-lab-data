DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 150 C/ise.—The use of the fascia lumborum is to g'ive origin to muscles^ and to afford a general support to the loins, by maintaining in some measure the equilibrium of the body without the aid of muscle. This fascia being- examined we may proceed to the dis- section of the extensive mass of muscles which is found in this reg-ion of the body, and which, for facility of description, is divided into seven layers. The first layer is composed of the m. trapezius and latis- simus dorsi, which have already been described ; the former attaching- the scapula, and the latter the os humeri, to the trunk. The second layer is composed of the rhomboidei and levator scapulae ; each of these have also been described as attaching- the scapula to the trunk. We now proceed to the third layer, which consists of two muscles, the serrati postici, both being- muscles of respiration, and have not therefore in my arrang-ement been hitherto described. , The m. serratus posticus superior—arises by a tendon common to it, the rhomboidei, the trapezius, and the splenius muscles ; from the spinous processes of the three inferior cervical, and the two or three superior dorsal vertebrae : from these orig-ins it soon becomes muscular, and passes downwards and outwards to be inserted by distinct fleshy fibres into the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, anterior to their ang-les. This thin square muscle is covered by the trapezius and rhomboideus; it covers part of the splenius, long-issimus dorsi, sacro lumbalis, ribs, and external intercostal muscles. Use,—To raise the ribs, and consequently fo increase the capacity of the chest. The m, serratus posticus inferior—arises by a broad thin tendon from the spinous processes of the three last dorsal and the three superior lumbar vertebrm, in connection w-ith the fascia lumborum; this tendon proceeds obliquely up- wards and outwards across the long-issimus dorsi and sacro

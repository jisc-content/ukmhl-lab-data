128 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. articular surface, to complete the articulation between the carpus and the radius. Below, this bone is concave from behind to before, to receive the inner surface of the head of the os mag-num. The inner side presents a large flattened articular surface, for the cuneiform bone; and at the angle formed by these two last-named surfaces, is situated the apex of the unciform bone. The outer side is connected with the os scaphoides, by a flattened semilunar articulation. The dorsal and palmar surfaces of this bone are rough, for the attachment of ligament. Use.—The os lunare assists in completing the wrist-joint, as well as the carpal articulations. This bone does not receive the attachment of any muscle. Os Cuneiforme. The cuneiform bone has derived its name from its wedge- like form, and is situated on the ulnar side of the cubital row of the carpus. It presents a superior flattened articular sur- face, to connect it with the lunar bone ; an outer, somewhat concave surface, for its attachment to the unciform bone ; a rounded surface anteriorly, for the pisiform bone; and a con- vex one, placed superiorly and internally, which corresponds to the under surface of the interarticular cartilage, separating the bone from the ulna. This bone also presents an internal, a palmar, and a dorsal non-articular surface, rough for the attachment of ligament. Use.—The cuneiform hone, by its junction with the interarticular cartilage, completes the wrist-joint. This bone does not receive the attachment of any muscles. Os Pisiforme. From its rounded figure, sometimes called the os orbiculare. It is placed in front of the cuneiform bone, with which it is connected by its only articular surface; this surface being flat and placed posteriorly. In front, this bone is irregularly

229 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. It g-lves orig-in in part to the omo hyoideus muscle, covers the supra scapula nerve, which passes through the foramen, while the supra scapula artery takes its course above the ligament, and is consequently separated from the nerve by it: both the nerve and the artery, in passing to their destination, are situated in front of the origin of the omo hyoideus muscle. Motions of the Clavicle. I am now to describe the numerous and different motions of which the clavicle is capable, and from which it might a priori be supposed, that this bone would be very frequently liable to dislocation; in consequence, however, of the many strong ligaments which connect it at its sternal and scapular ex- tremities, its luxation happens less frequently in proportion to its motions, than that of any other bone in the body. The motions of the clavicle are dependant upon those of the scapula, which is capable of being moved upwards, downwards, forwards, and backwards ; and from the combi- nation of all these movements, it likewise admits of circum- duction. Although the scapular extremity of the clavicle receives the first impulse from muscular power, still it is at the sternal ex- tremity that the ligaments sustain the greatest change under these various motions. First, upwards.—When the shoulder is raised by the ele- vation of the scapula, the sternal extremity of the clavicle is thrust deeply into its articular cavity, and thus its interarti- cular cartilage is brought nearer to the surfaces of the clavicle and sternum; the rhomboid or costo-clavicular ligament being put upon the stretch, prevents luxation and further motion; while the inter clavicular, anterior, and posterior ligaments, are relaxed. Secondly, downwards.—In this motion, the ligaments are precisely in an opposite state to the preceding. Q 2

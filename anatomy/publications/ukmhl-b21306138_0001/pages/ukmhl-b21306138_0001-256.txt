LECTURE VIII. GENERAL ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. By an articulation, or joint, is meant the union of two or more bones, by some intervening' medium of connexion, dif- fering in structure from the bones themselves; and when they are represented as thus retaining the different portions of the osseous system in their relative situations, the whole is said to form a natural skeleton. The classification of bones, according to their size and shape, and their anatomical description, has already made us acquainted with the precise points at which they become connected with each other. It is a general rule that long bones meet at their extremities, flat bones at their edges, and the short bones at different points of their surfaces. The shape and configuration of the different processes of bones, which thus become contiguous, is a most important consi- deration in the study of joints, as on that depends, in a great measure, both the function of the articulation, and its liabihty to injury. Moreover, we shall always find a certain degree of correspondence between the articulatory surface of the bones and the other structures concerned in their union. Tire uses of joints are either to allow of a positive and evident motion between the bones which they connect, or merely to permit such a relaxation or yielding, as may take off the injurious effects of concussion or accidental pressure. The parts which enter into the composition of articulations, consist of all those structures hitherto described in these lec- tures: namely, iowe, cartilage, jibro-cartilage, synovial mem- brane, and ligaments. The only one of these structures, however, which is essential to every joint, is bone; and the

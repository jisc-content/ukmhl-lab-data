DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 203' and behind the insertion of the sartorius; also sending' an aponeurotic expansion to the fascia of the leg*. At its origin, it is placed on the inner side of the triceps fernoris, between it and the crus penis 5 its inner surface is covered by the fascia lata, and below by the sartorius; it covers the adductor magnus, semimembranosus, and the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint; it is inserted between the sartorius, which is above it, and the semitendi- nosus, which is below it. Use.—To fle.x the leg, and also to adduct it. Tlie four remaining flexors of the knee are situated on the posterior part of the thigh. The m. semitendinosus—arises tendinous and fleshy from the tuberosity of the ischium, in common with the long head of the biceps, and fleshy from the inner side of the tendon of the biceps; from these origins the fibres pass obliquely downwards and inwards, forming a fleshy muscle, which terminates in a round tendon about four inches above the knee; this tendon passes behind the internal condyle placed between the inner origin of the gastrocnemius, and tendon of the semimembranosus; is inserted into the inner side of the tibia, below the insertion of the gracilis muscle, to which it is connected by an aponeurotic expansion, as well as to the fascia of the leg. The origin of the semitendinosus is covered by the glutmus maximus ; it lies between the biceps and gracilis ; posteriorly it is covered by the fascia lata, anteriorly it crosses the upper part of the adductor magnus. This muscle is usually intersected about its middle by a transverse tendinous line; from which circumstance it has been probably named; for, in fact, it is not so tendinous a muscle as the semimembranosus. Use.—To flex the leg, and to turn it slightly inwards. The m. semimembranosus.—Its origin is concealed by the common origin of the preceding muscle, and of the long’ head of the biceps ; it arises by a flat tendon from the upper

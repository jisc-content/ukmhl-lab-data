10 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. structures and systems entering- into their composition; wc according’Iy find, that they alFord various substances when exposed to chemical analysis; but it may be justly said that there is but one constituent which forms the distinguishing characteristic of this system,—the fleshy fibre, which is proved to be very analagous to the fibrine of blood. The red colour which the muscular fibre possesses is not peculiar to it; for by cutting the fibre into very minute pieces, the colour may be completely extracted. Berzelius, from the result of his experiments, has given the following analysis of the muscular sj^stem; but, before the precise substances are mentioned, it may be well perhaps to inform the student, that all animal matter difiers from vegetable, in having an additional ele- mentary constituent, namely, nitrogen ; carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, alone forming the elementary bases of vege- table matter. An hundred parts of dried muscle, according to Pfaff, as quoted by Meckel, consisted of the following proportions of the elements of animal matter:— Carbon 48 30 Hydrogen 10 64 Nitrogen 15 92 Oxygen 17 64 92 50 Fixed Salts . 7 50 100 00 The other substances which compose muscle, are divided by Berzelius into those which are solid, and those which are fluid.

XVlll LKCTUUES ON ANATOMY. death ; while the rich, even the monarch himself, if denied so precious a boon, must feel all the refinements, the splen- dour, the luxury that opulence can purchase, to be merely a splendid curse ; must regard even the most intellectual of all social pleasures with a weary eye ; “ view, undelighted, all delight,” and denounce the amenities of life. If such be the value of health, never so truly estimated as by its loss, how important a share of attention must be claimed for that science which aims at its preservation ! In this introductory address, it will be my endeavour to explain the object and bearing of this course of lectures, and to point out the best mode of acquiring a knowledge of the structure and uses of the various parts of the human body— which branch of science is designated human anatomy. Although to acquire a knowledge of pathology and the- rapeutics be the ultimate object of the medical student, still it will be obvious to every one of you that these studies must be preceded by, and founded upon a perfect knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the human body; for it is only through these that we can determine the nature and extent of disease, and by which we can hope to adopt*ra- tional and judicious rules for its treatment. Since to ascer- tain the structure of organized matter is the proper object of anatomy, and to define the functions of the different or- gans, that of physiology ; so, to distinguish the diseases and morbid affections to which they are liable (as well as to remove them), is the object of pathology and therapeutics. Having’ already necessarily made use of different scientific terms, I conceive it a duty imposed upon me, before I pro- - ceed further, to give you a concise explanation of them ; for without their being rightly comprehended, I could not be understood. First, of anatomy, which, etymologically considered, merely implies the means employed for anatomical investi- gation, and not the science itself. Some modern teachers have attempted to explain its meaning by terming it the science of organization; but this also seems to me vague

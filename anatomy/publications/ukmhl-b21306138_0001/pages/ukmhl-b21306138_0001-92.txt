THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM, 50 lary; thus g’iving' great streng-th to the articulation. These bones become wider as they descend towards their inferior edges, which are spreading-, and very irregular, to give at- tachment to the cartilages of the nose. The two ossa nasi, when connected, form an arch, filling up the space between the nasal processes of the superior maxillary bones; thus constituting the fore part of the nasal cavity. From their junction internally proceeds a small spine, through the medium of which they become connected with the ethmoid bone. Connexion.—These bones are connected, above, to the os fronds; anteriorly, to each other, and to the nasal plate of the ethmoid; posteriorly, to the superior maxillary bones; and internally, to the septum narium. Attachment of Muscles.—Those attached to the nasal bones are the occipito-frontalis, and compressor naris. Practical Remarks. The manner in which these bones are articulated, as well as their arched form, renders them but little liable to fracture, notw'ithstanding their exposed position, and the little protection afforded them by soft parts. When, however, they are broken, the diagnosis is sufficiently obvious from the deformity produced. The prognosis is favourable, unless the accident be complicated with injury to some more important parts. Compound fractures are usually followed by exfoliation of bone, rendering the cure tedious. The Ossa Lacrymalia, Or, ossa unguis, have been so named from their use and form: they are situated on the inner and fore part of the orbit, and present an external and internal surface, and four edges. The external surface is divided by a thin ridge into two portions ; the posterior of wluch is plain, forming a part of the orbit, and may be called therefore the orhitar process. The anterior portion is hollowed, and assists in forming a cavity for lodging the lacrymal sac and ductus ad nasum. The internal surface is irregular, and covers the anterior ethmoidal cells.

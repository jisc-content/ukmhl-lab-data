GENERAL ANATOMY OK MUSCLES. 7 some measure at least, from the blood. The arteries which supply the tendinous fibres of the muscles are smaller than those which supply the lleshy fibres, and are destined to con- vey only the transparent parts of the blood, so that they are with difficulty demonstrated; while the vessels which supply the cellular membrane, although very small, do convey some slight colouring' matter, which proves that the different rami- fications of the same trunk are capable, not only of being distributed to different tissues, but also of yielding only such parts of the blood to them as can be assimilated, and assume the character of that structure of wdiich they are destined to form a part. It is found that the larger trunks of arteries, as they pass through the muscular system to distant parts, are deeply situated, and are placed in such circumstances as to be protected from external injury. The veins which return that portion of the blood from the muscular system which is not employed for their growth, development, and function, are distributed in two sets; the one being situated in the interior of muscles, accompanying the arteries, while the other is observed running upon the surface of the muscles: the object of this appears to be, that, during the action and consequent contraction of a muscle, the flow of blood through the veins towards the heart should not be im- peded; hence the phenomenon of the superficial veins becom- ing distended with blood when the muscles of the arm are put into a state of contraction. The veins have a greater capacity than the arteries: they commence, by the minutest ramification, from the ultimate fibre of the muscle, into which an equally small ramification of an artery had terminated; and then, forming frequent anastomoses in the surrounding cellular membrane, produce the larger superficial branches, and take their course towards the heart. The veins of the muscular system have been supposed by Bichat not to be supplied with so many valves as the veins of the other struc- tures; but he seems to infer it only from the supposition tliat they do not require them in consequence of the support they derive from tlie muscles themselves, which form a substitute

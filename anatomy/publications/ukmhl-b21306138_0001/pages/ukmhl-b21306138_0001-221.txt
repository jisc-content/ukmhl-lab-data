159 BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. The outer extremity,oXiiB upper and posterior part,presents a small articular surface, where it is connected with the cuboid bone. This bone does not reach the metatarsal bones, but a space is left between them and the navicular, for the three cunei- form bones. Attachment of Mxiscles.—Thc m. tibialis posticus is partly inserted into the under surface of the bone. The Three Cuneiform Bones Are placed so as to be articulated, behind, with the navi- cular ; in front, with the metatarsal bones, supporting" the three inner toes; and externally, with the cuboid bone. The Internal Cuneiform Bone Is thelarg-est of the three, is of an irregular prismatic form; its base situated below, and its apex above ; it presents a posterior articular surface, concave from side to side, which is connected with the navicular bone, and an anterior, plain, articular surface, lengthened from above to below, to join it with the metatarsal bone of the g"reat toe. Its external sur- face is concave, and presents two articular faces, a posterior one which is placed vertically, to be connected with the middle cuneiform bone; and to the anterior and superior horizontal face, the metatarsal bone of the second toe is articulated. The internal surface is scabrous, and is furnished with two tubercles, which g-ive partly origin to the m. abductor polhcis, and insertion to the tibiahs anticus. The apex is situated on the dorsum of the foot, and is directed obliquely from behind to before, is rough, and gives attachment to ligaments. The base, which is placed in the sole of the foot, also is rough for the firm connexion of the plantar ligaments. Attachment of Muscles.—The m. tibialis anticus and posticus, and peroneus longus, arc inserted into it.

bones of the extremities. 131 bone of the carpus, and is situated in the middle of the digital row. Its superior, or cubital surface, forms a rounded articular apophysis, which is termed its head, and which is received into the articular cavity formed by the scaphoides, lunare, and unciform bones. The head is attached to the body of the bone, by a contracted portion which may be termed its neck. \isbase, or inferior digital surface, is somewhat triangular, and presents three articulatory divisions, the middle of which is much the largest, to receive the whole of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger ; while the metacarpal bone of the fore and ring fingers rest on the lateral divisions. Its outer surface presents two articulatory faces, the upper convex, for the scaphoid bone, and the inferior, of an iiregular form, for the trapezoid bone. Its ulnar side is principally formed of a large flattened superior surface, which is connected with the os unciforme; and below this, a small portion of the articulatory surface, for the metacarpal bone of the ring finger, presents itself. Two non-articular surfaces may also be described on this bone: the large posterior, or dorsal surface, rough for the attachment of the dorso-carpal ligaments; and its anterior, or palmar surface, narrowed to assist in forming the lateral arch of the carpus, for the passage of the flexor tendons of the wrist and fingers. Use.—This bone enters principally into the formation of the carpal joint, and assists in supporting- three of the metacarpal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—The flexor brevis pollicis is the only muscle attached to the os magnum. Os Unciforme. This bone supports the metacarpal bones of the fourth and fifth fingers, and is situated between the magnum and cunei- form bones: it is somewhat of a triangular form, the base being placed below and the apex above. The base, or digital surface, is covered with cartilage, and divided into two nearly equal-sized articulatory portions, by a

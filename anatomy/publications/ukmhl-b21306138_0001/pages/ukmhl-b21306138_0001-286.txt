224 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. Articulations of the Superior Extremity. The shoulder is united by means of the clavicle with the sternum, through the medium of an interarticular cartilage, but the scapula is only connected with the trunk by muscle ; and the sterno-clavicular articulation forms the fulcrum for the whole of the upper extremity to move upon the trunk. Articulation of the Clavicle to the Sternum. Class Diarthrosis.—Subdivision Arthrodia. The sternal extremity of the clavicle is concave, and is placed rather above the articular surface of the sternum; these two surfaces are covered by cartilage. This articulation is constituted by four ligaments; an anterior, a posterior, an inter clavicular, and a costo clavicular, or rhomboid; and by an interarticular cartilage. The anterior ligament is composed of strong fibres, which run in parallel lines from the upper extremity of the clavicle to the anterior face of the first bone of the sternum : there its fibres diverge and mix with the ligaments connecting the first rib, and assist in forming the anterior ligamentous sheath of the sternum. Its posterior face is united firmly to the in- terarticular cartilage, and to the synovial membrane; its anterior corresponds to the origin of the sterno-cleido mas- toideus muscle, and the integuments. The posterior ligament is neither so large nor so strong as the anterior; it is united above to the posterior part of the internal surface of the clavicle, and below to the superior and posterior surface of the sternum, being firmly attached to the edge of the articular surface. The anterior portion of this ligament is in contact with the interarticular cartilage and the synovial membrane; the posterior covers and gives partly origin to the sterno-hyoideus and thyroideus muscles. Inter clavicular ligament. — This ligament is strong.

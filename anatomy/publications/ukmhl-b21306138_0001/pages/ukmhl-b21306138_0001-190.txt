134 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Metacarpal Bone of the Fore Finger. This is the longâ€™est of the metacarpal bones, and may he also known from the others by its upper extremity, or base, presenting a deep sulcus, by which it articulates with the trapezoid bone, separating an outer articulatory surface for the trapezium, from a smaller one on the inner side, for the magnum: the ulnar side of the base offers a flattened surface, which is in contact with the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. All these articulatory surfaces are covered by a con- tinuous cartilage. Upon the palmar surface of the base, there is a roughness for the insertion of the m. flexor carpi radialis. The dorsal and outer surface of the base, is marked by the insertion of the m. extensor carpi radialis longior. On the ulnar surface of the head is a small tubercle, for the at- tachment of the outer metacarpal ligament, connecting it with the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. The body of this bone is triangular, concave on its ulnar side only, for the lodgement of the prior indicis muscle. Metacarpal Bone of the Middle Finger. The base is situated obliquely, and forms articular sur- face only, to be connected to the magnum. On either side the base of the bone is covered with cartilage, where it is in contact with the metacarpal bones of the index and ring fin- gers. The dorsal surface is broad and rough for the attach- ment of hgaments, and furnished with a tubercle for the insertion of the m. extensor carpi radialis brevior. Its palmar surface is very contracted, thus tending to produce the trans- verse arch of the hand. The head and body of this bone do not require any further description. The adductor pollicis muscle arises from this bone. Metacarpal Bone of the Ring Finger. The base of this bone is small, but presents four articulatory surfaces : two above, a large inner one to be connected to the uneiforme, and a small ridge to join it with the magnum. It

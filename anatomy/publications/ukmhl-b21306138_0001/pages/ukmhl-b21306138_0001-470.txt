84 DESCRimVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, C quence of its greater breadth; it is also enveloped by a process of the deep cervical fascia; at its orig’in it has be- hind it the internal jugular and subclavian veins, and on the right side also the arteria innominata: it then runs up- wards upon the trachaea, and its outer edge partly overlaps the carotid sheath ; it afterwards lies upon the thyroid gland and crico thyroideus muscle. Use,—It depresses the os hyoides, larynx and thyroid cartilage ; and by the motion which it gives to the latter, modifies the voice by stretching the vocal chords. The m. thyro hyoideus—arises from the oblique line upon the ala of the thyroid cartilage, immediately above the in- sertion of the last described muscle, so as to appear con- tinuous with it; and passes directly upwards to be inserted into the lower and outer edge of the base, and into the anterior half of the cornu of the os hyoides. This rhuscle is concealed by the sterno hyoideus and omo hyoideus muscles, and lies upon the thyroid cartilage and thyro hyoid ligament. Use.—To draw the os hyoides downwards, and thus assist the sterno hyoid, thyroid and omo hyoid muscles in fixing it. The m. omo hyoideus—a thin lengthened muscle, taking an oblique direction on the side of the neck ; it arises from the superior costa of the scapula, near the proper notch of that bone, and from the ligament which passes across the notch to form it into a foramen ; it then passes upward posterior to the clavicle, and crosses that triangular space which has been described as being formed by the clavicle inferiorly, and by the sterno mastoid and trapezius muscles laterally; at the posterior edge of the sterno mastoideus it becomes tendinous, and passes behind this muscle in a direction forming an acute angle with the clavicle ; it again becomes fleshy as it approaches the outer edge of the sterno hyoideus: and now altering its direction, passes nearly vertically upwards to be inserted into die os hyoides, at the junction of its body with its cornea. This muscle at its

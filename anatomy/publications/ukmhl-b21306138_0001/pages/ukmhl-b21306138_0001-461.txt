DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 75 the orbicularis oris, are the three pairs situated upon the chin below the opening" of the mouth. The m. levatores labii inferioris, are situated in a similar manner with respect to the lower lip that the depressores are with the upper, being" placed between the mucous membrane of the mouth and the lower jaw. They arise just below the alveolar processes of the incisor teeth of the inferior maxillary bone 5 the fibres diverg"e as they pass downward to be inserted into the inner surface of the lower lip and the skin of the chin. Use.—The use of tliese muscles is to raise the skin of the chin and lower lip in a direction inwards and backwards, so as to cover the teeth of the low^r jaw. The m. depressores labii inferioris.—To expose these muscles some of the attenuated fibres of the platysma moyides must be raised; they are flat and broad muscles, arising" from the anterior and lateral parts of the inferior maxillary bone, extending" as far outwards as the orig"in of the depressores ang"uli oris, and continue as far forwards as the middle line, where the muscle of each side approxi- mates ; from this attachment they pass upwards, their anterior fibres vertically, their posterior with obliquity in- wards, to be inserted into the under lip, and to be connected with the orbicularis oris. The depressores ang"uli oris partly cover the outer origin of these muscles. Use.—To depress the lower lip. The m. depressores anguli oris, are situated on the outer side of the last described muscles ; their form is triangular, gradually dirninishing in breadth from their origin to their insertion. They arise from the sides of the inferior max- illary bone, a little above its base, from a line extending from the root of the coronoid process to the anterior max- illary foramen, and pass upward to be inserted into the corner of the mouth, uniting with the zygomatici orbicularis oris and buccinatores. They are covered by the integu-

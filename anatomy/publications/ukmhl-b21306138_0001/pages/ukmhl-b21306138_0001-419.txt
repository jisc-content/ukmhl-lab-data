GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 33 directed. Tendons are not attached to the involuntary mus- cles excepting- in the heart, where we find the fleshy columns attached by tendon to the valves ; neither are the sphincter muscles furnished with tendinous attachments. Tendons, sometimes divide into several ramifications to be attached to separate bones, as the tendons passing- from the muscles of the toes and fing^ers ; and in other instances, we find two or more tendons uniting- to form one, as the junction of the g-astrocnemii soleus and plantaris in forming- the tendo Achillis. The tendons do not usually change the direction of mus- cular motion, but this chang-e does however sometimes occur from the projection of the apophyses of the bones, as may be observed in the malleoli reflecting- the tendons of the flexors of the foot and toes nearly to a right angle ; and, indeed, the tendons themselves sometimes send off processes to be con- nected with other parts out of the direction of their insertion into bone, as the tendon of the biceps both of the arm and leg; the former to produce the fascia of the fore arm, and the latter to be connected with the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The tendons are furnished with cellular sheaths, which resemble in their use the periosteum of bone and the perichondrium of ligament; and they are in some situations tied down by annular portions of ligament as they pass over bone; in which case these envelopes are furnished with a synovial membrane to protect them from injury by friction ; besides this, where tendons pass close to bone, they are fre- quently converted into a fibro-cartilaginous tissue, and even in some instances into bone itself, to render them better able to bear friction and pressure. The tendons are enclosed in a Â§heath of loose cellular membrane, which secretes a fluid to lubricate their surfaces, and facilitate their motion ; into this membrane small blood-vessels may be traced conveying red blood, but they cannot be demonstrated passing into the tendons themselves; a circumstance which depends partly upon their diminutive size, and partly because they circulate only the transparent constituents of the blood.

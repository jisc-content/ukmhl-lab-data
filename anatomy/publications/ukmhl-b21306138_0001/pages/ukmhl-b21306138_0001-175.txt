BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 121 gives to it the leng-th which it possesses beyond the radius. This process is rough above, for the attachment of the triceps muscle. Behind it forms a triang-ular surface, which is merely covered with skin, and may be easily felt in the living subject. Anteriorly, it is concave, covered with cartilage, and forms a portion of the articulatory cavity which receives the internal condyle of the humerus. The smaller anterior process is termed the coronoid: it is situated below as well as before the olecranon, and is directed from the upper part of the ulna forwards, and slightly upwards. Its posterior surface is con- cave, and, in the recent subject, covered with a cartilage continuous with that lining the olecranon; thus, together, completing the greater sigmoid cavity, which receives the trochlea of the humerus. This cavity is divided by a ridge, passing from the upper part of the olecranon, to the top of the coronoid process, into two unequal portions, the inner of w'hich is the larger. Immediately on the outer edge of the coronoid process is found the smaller sigmoid cavity, which is hollowed from before to behind, and receives the inner arti- cular surface of the head of the radius. The inner edge of the coronoid process is sharp, and roughened, for the attach- ment of muscles and ligaments ; while, anteriorly and below, it terminates in a roughened tubercle, to which is attached the tendon of the brachialis internus muscle. The body of the ulna is triangular, and presents an anterior, a posterior, and an internal surface: also an external, an anterior, and a posterior angle. The anterior surface is concave throughout its whole length, to lodge the numerous muscles situated between it and the radius. The lower part of this surface is somewhat flattened and rough, for the origin of the pronator quadratus. In its upper third may be seen the nutritious foramen, which takes its course from below upwards. The posterior surface is divided by a line which passes from the posterior edge of the smaller sigmoid cavity through the whole length of the bone, and gives insertion to some of the muscles of the elbow- joint, and origin to those of the fingers. The internal surface

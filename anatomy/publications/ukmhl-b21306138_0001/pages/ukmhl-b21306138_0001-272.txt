210 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. vertebrae is effected by the common anterior and common pos- terior vertebral ligaments, and by an intervertebral substance. Articulation of the Bodies of the Vertebra;. Class Amphiarthrosis. The common anterior vertebral ligament originates at the lower edge of the anterior portion of the circular hgament, on the upper part of the second cervical vertebra, and extends to the sacrum, varying in breadth and thickness in its descent. It is thin and narrow on its cervical vertebrae, thicker and wider on the dorsal, and again attenuates; but it is at its greatest breadth in the lumbar region. It is composed of numerous distinct longitudinal fibres, which are separated for the transmission of blood-vessels. This ligament expands itself more widely over the intervertebral substance than in its passage over the bodies of the vertebrae. Its anterior surface through the cervical region is covered by the pha- rynx and oesophagus; on the dorsal, by the oesophagus, aorta, thoracic duct, and vena azygos; and on the lumbar, by the aorta, vena cava, and the receptaculum chyh. Its posterior surface is in contact with the vertebrae themselves and with the crucial ligaments, and is also laterally connected with the longus colli muscle. If the common anterior liga- ment be raised from the intervertebral substance, small decus- sating fibres may be seen passing from the lower edge of the vertebra above, to the upper edge of the vertebra below, crossing each other as they pass; from which circumstance they have been termed the crucial ligaments. The common anterior vertebral ligament has the shining metallic lustre of the fibrous system generally; it is composed of a superficial and deep layer of fibres; the latter being firmly connected with the vertebrJB themselves, while the former are strength- ened in the cervical region by the tendinous origin of the muscles of the neck, and in the loins by the crura of the

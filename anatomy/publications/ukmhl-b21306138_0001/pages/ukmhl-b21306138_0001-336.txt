274 Iâ€™ARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, the popliteus muscle; in the middle part, with the external lateral ligament; and in the fore part with the tibia, being placed behind the anterior extremity of the internal cartilage; while behind, it is anterior to the corresponding extremity of its fellow'. These cartilages are composed of fibres, which are more perceptible in their convex than concave edges ; they are anteriorly connected to one another by a short trans- verse ligament; their superior surfaces are concave, their inferior flattened, and both are covered by synovial membrane, which is reflected under their free concave edges. These two ligaments together, resemble the interarticular cartilages of other joints ; leaving, however, a large opening between the two synovial cavities, w'hich they have a tendency to separate. The synovial membrane takes a course rather difficult to trace, as it lines the inner surfaces of all the ligaments, as well as the cartilaginous surfaces of the bones entering into the composition of the knee-joint. We will first trace it from the inner surface of the extensor tendons of the leg, just as they are inserted into the patella. From this point it pro- ceeds upwards, lining the under surface of this tendon as high as the condyles of the femur, upon which it then be- comes reflected, forming a cul de sac between the two; it passes round the extremity of the femur, as far backw'ards as the posterior hgament; at the same time surrounding the crucial ligaments, so as to leave them posterior to its cavity. From thence it is continued on the superior surface of the semilunar cartilages, lining also the external and internal lateral ligaments ; it then dips under the concave free edges of the semilunar cartilages, covers the whole superior arti- cular surface of the tibia, and proceeds from the anterior point of this bone to the inner surface of the ligament of the patella, extending laterally to the anterior edges of the two lateral ligaments. These at the points w'here they are at- tached to the edges of the ligamentum patellae, are called the alee ligaments It then rises upon the inner surface of the patella, and passes from its base upon the tendon of the

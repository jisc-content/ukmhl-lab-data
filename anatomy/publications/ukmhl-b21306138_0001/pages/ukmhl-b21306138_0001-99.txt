BONES OF THE HEAD. 57 The body, or palatine process, is the most compact part of the bone. It forms an horizontal square plate, which presents a superior surface, concave, to enlarg-e the cavity of the nose; an inferior concave surface, to form the posterior part of the roof of the mouth; an anterior serrated edge, which connects this part of the palate bone to the superior maxillary bone ; a posterior, smooth, semilunar edge, which gives attachment to the muscles of the soft palate; an inner straight edge, elevated and rough, to be connected with its fellow, their junc- tion forming the nasal spine and part of the bony septum of the nose: and lastly, an external edge, which connects this portion of the palate bone to its Nasal or ascending process.â€”This process is a thin lamina of bone rising perpendicularly upward from the outer edge of the palatine process, and passing into the nose on the inner side of the tuberosity of the superior maxillary bone. The nasal plate presents an internal surface which forms the outer bony boundary to the nose, and has placed upon it a thin spine passing from before to behind, which lodges the inferior turbinated bone. Its external surface is rough, to attach it to the maxillary bone, and presents a deep groove passing from above to below, leading into the roof of the mouth, and forming the palato-maxillary foramen. The upper half of the nasal process covers the posterior part of the antrum high- morianum, and diminishes the opening of this cavity into the middle chamber of the nose. From the anterior upper edge of the nasal plate the third process of the palate bone presents itself, viz., the orhitar process. This is attached to the nasal lamella by a kind of neck, giving the appearance of a notch when the palate bone is separated from the other bones of the head, but forming by its junction with the sphenoid bone a foramen, which leads into the nose, and is termed the spheno- palatine or lateral nasal foramen. The orbitar process is of a triangular shape, being wedged in at the back part of the orbit between the orbitar processes of the superior maxillary ethmoid and sphenoid bones. The posterior surface of this

GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 13 assume its natural size after it has been stretched by some mechanical pressure, as after ascites or parturition,â€”is doubtful; it being- a question whether this apparent physical elasticity belong-s to muscle, or to the surrounding;- tissues; for we find after death, at least, that it loses this power upon the separation of its cellular coverings, when it is very readily torn. Vital propei'ties are those by which the functions of the muscular system are produced. During life, the muscles are observed to possess and to exercise a power which is termed contractility; the capacity for which is designated irritability. By contractility is meant, that power by which a muscle, from the application of a stimulus, is capable of shortening itself; and it is in consequence of this inherent power, that all their actions are performed. A muscle, when in a state of contraction, becomes harder, thicker, broader, proportionably shorter, and transversely wrinkled, and their fibres are observed to manifest a trembling or oscillating motion, which is owing to their alternately con- tracting and relaxing; and they are further found by experiment to have acquired considerable strength, which seems obvious from the fact, that muscles are less capable of resisting injury from external violence during their passive or relaxed state. Such is the state, as usually described, of a muscle when in action; but there is reason for entertaining some doubts as to the accuracy of the account given. Is it, for instance, certain, that the muscular fibres of a muscle are of necessity shortened during contraction ; or, may it not be, that the muscle is only thrown into the form of a bow, as its two extremities are made to approach each other? For if we attempt to raise a weight 4oo great for our muscular power, the muscles are put into the greatest possi- ble state of action, and yet no shortening can occur ; so that it may be said, that the shortening depends upon the de- gree of stimulus being greater than that of the resistance. The apparent thickness and increase of hardness in a con- tracted muscle, may also be attributed to its change of place

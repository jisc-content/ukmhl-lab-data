BONES OF THE HEAD. 45 tho upper and back part of the roof of the mouth in the palato- maxillary foramen. These foramina transmit the descending- palatine, or palato-ma.xillary nerve of the second division of the fifth pair, and its corresponding- artery, from the internal maxillary. Lastly, the spheno-maxillary fissures, or foramina lacera orbitalia inferiora, are situated between the orbitar processes of the sphenoid and superior maxillary bones, and are bounded behind by the palate bones: they extend along- the back and under part of the orbits, communicate with the spheno-maxil- lary fossa, and allow the passage of the infra-orbitar nerve, and a branch of the internal maxillary artery: but it may also be observed, that the carotid canal is in part common to the sphe- noid and temporal bones. Connexion.â€”In the description of the attachment of this bone to the other bones of the skull, it is to be considered as placed in its natural position, and beginning from before on the middle line, passing outwards, then backwards, and lastly to its inferior surface. The os sphenoides is connected by the rough edge of the anterior and middle part of the body, which is termed the ethmoidal spine, with the ethmoid bone; by the alae minores, and anterior edge of the alae majores with the frontal bone; and by the rough triangular surface on the ex- ternal and superior edge of the alae majores with the parietal bones. The ridge on the fore part of the alae majores, sepa- rating the orbitar from the temporal processes, and termed the malar process, connects the sphenoid with the malar bone; by the whole of the outer serrated edges of the alae majores, extending as far backwards as to the spinous processes, it is joined to the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bones: and lastly by the posterior part of its body to the occi- pital bone it is joined by epiphysis in early periods of life, rhe anterior surfaces of the pterygoid processes are attached to the palate bone; and sometimes also immediately below this attachment these processes are connected to the superior maxillary bone: lastly, the azygos process of the sphenoid bone is joined to the vomer.

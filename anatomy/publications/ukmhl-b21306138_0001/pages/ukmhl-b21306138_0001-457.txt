71 DESCRll’TIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Tlio m. levaiores palpebrarum superiorum, which, al- though not easily exposed at this stage of the dissection, cannot with propriety be omitted in this classification; although they must be^ again mentioned when describing the muscles situated within the bony orbits. These muscles arise from the superior edge of the foramen opticum of the sphenoid bone, proceed forwards upon the under surface of the orbitar process of the frontal bone, and becoming larger anteriorly are inserted, thin and tendinous, into the tarsus of the upper eyelid. Use.—These muscles are passing from behind to before, describing a curve, the convexity of which is turned upwards, corresponding to tlie form of the ball of the eye, which form enables them to raise the eye- lids ; they also moderate the actions of the upper ciliary portions of the orbiculares palpebrarum, acting alternately with them, and preserving the moisture and transparency of the cornea, and protecting it from dust and strong reflections of light. The third orbicular muscle surrounds the opening of the mouth, and is termed, therefore, the orbicularis oris. It is composed of two portions of circular fleshy fibres which pass around the lips, decussating each other on either side, and freely intermixing with the insertions of the muscles which moderate its actions, and which tend in a great measure to form it. This muscle is covered anteriorly by the integ'U- ments, and posteriorly is in contact with the lining mucous membrane of the mouth and lips ; it is not attached to bone; immediately beneath the skin a considerable quantity of fat is mixed with its fibres, which are free from it posteriorly. Use.—To close the mouth by bringing the lips in contact; by the action of the muscles intermixed with it, the mouth is opened ; and by the alternate action of this sphincter and its moderators, the counte- nance is furnished with means of expressing all the varieties of emotion and passion. The muscles which are employed in assisting and mode- rating the action of the orbicularis oris are ten pairs, and are situated around the opening of the mouth in the following order:— Four pairs above the upper lip, three pairs by the side of f2

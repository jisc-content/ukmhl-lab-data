GENKRAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. 21)1 are similar results to those produced by subjecting lime water to the action of expired, air. May not this decar- bonizing- function principally depend upon the venous struc- ture which characterizes the rete mucosum immediately under the cuticle ? As in the lung’s, we find the veins bringing’ the blood to be exposed to the air within its cells, so in this venous distribution, it is exposed to the action of the air on the surface of the body. The parts are too minute to demonstrate the particular mode of the contact and connection between the venous distribution and the air ; but this structure of veins, and the known function which is performed by the skin, have so strong an analogy with respiration, that I cannot help throwing out the conjecture of their identity. The chemical analysis of perspiration shews, that it has vari- ous compounds; Dr. Anselmino, according to Richerand, states it to consist of— Calcareous salts - ----- 0 02 , Animal matter with the sulphate 0 21 Osraazone and chlorurets of soda and of lime ------0 48 Osmozone combined with the acetates and free acetic acid 0 29 0 100 The skin also secretes an oily matter, which may possibly be an exudation of the subcutaneous fat, as it is found most abun- dant in corpulent people ; it is of a greasy nature, burns with a white flame, and leaves a carbonaceous residuum ; it appears to serve the purpose of protecting the cuticle from the effects of the more fluid exudations of perspiration, as well as the moisture of the atmosphere; to this secretion is owing an effect seen in bathing, when the water may be observed to hang in drops upon the surface of the skin of the back, and to trickle off in parts without leaving the skin wetted. There is, further, a secretion from the sebaceous follicles.

LECTURE VII. FIBRO-CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE. The fibro-cartilag'inous tissue partakes equally of the phy- sical properties, structure, and texture of the fibrous and car- tilag’inous systems, possessing- the flexibility of the one and the elasticity of the other, thus rendering- it impossible to class it with either of those systems ; but it should rather be considered as a link between the two. Fibro-cartilag-e is composed of true cartilag-e, placed in the intervals of a densely interwoven fibrous tissue: the for- mer g-ives to fibro-cartilag-e, whiteness, smoothness, and elas- ticity; while the latter imparts to it the fibrous and metallic appearance of ligament, as well as flexibility. This tissue is found in three different situations in the human body; first, in the formation of important organs, as in the al® of the nose, the external ear, the eye-lids, and the trachma: secondly, entering into the composition of joints: and thirdly, lining grooves and forming sheaths, for the pas- sage of tendons to their insertions. These three classes, although very similar in appearance, yet difier in their form, chemical composition, and physical properties, possessing more or less elasticity and flexibility, according to the func- tion the organs they enter into the composition of have to perform. In the first class, where they form part of the ears, nose, &c., they are found expanded, so as to be considered by Bcchat as worthy of being termed “ fibro-cartilaginous membranesbut they are truly belonging to this system, being composed both of cartilage and ligament; but differ- ently disposed, and evidently in different proportions to this

THE OSSEOtJS SYSTEM. 104 The metatarsal bone of the fourth toe is nearly as long as (he former. The tarsal extremity of the bone, posteriorly, is furnished with an oval articulatory surface, somewhat ele- vated in the centre, and is connected with the cuboid bone. Its internal face is joined to the metatarsal bone of the third toe, and externally it is in contact with the metatarsal bone of the fifth toe. The body and head of this bone are similar to the second and third. The metatarsal bone of the fifth toe, at its posterior or tarsal extremity, presents a regular convex articular surface, inclined inwards, which is articulated with the cuboid bone ; while the outer extremity forms a protuberance which pro- jects behind and externally to its articulation with that bone. Anterior to the face for its articulation with the cuboid bone, is situated a small articulatory surface, for its connexion with the metatarsal bone of the fourth toe. The body of this bone presents a superior surface, which is convex from within to without; its head oSexs nothing remarkable. The five metatarsal bones are so connected with each other, and the bones of the tarsus, as to form a convexity from side to side on the dorsal aspect, and a concavity from side to side in the plantar region. Attachment of Muscles.—Muscles common to the metatarsus are the m. interrossei and transversalis pedis: proper to the first metatarsal hone m. tibialis anticus and peroneus longus; to the second m. adductor pol- licis pedis: and to the fifth, m. peroneus brevis, abductor and fle.xor brevis, minimi digiti. The Toes Form the third division of the bones of the foot, and are ' five in number. They are composed of fourteen bones termed phalanges ,• each of them being furnished with three of these bones, excepting the great toe, which has but two, as the great toe wants its middle phalanx. The phalanges are classed as the posterior, middle and anterior row.

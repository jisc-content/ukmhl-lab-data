302 ANATOMY OF HAIRS. Great Variety is presented in the form and texture of tlie hairs of difl'erent animals, as well as on different parts of the same animal: a similarity of strueture, however, probably appertains to all; not only in the different sorts of hair, wool, fur, and bristles of the porcupine, but in the feathers of birds. It is generally supposed that the hairs, in passing out of the skin, receive a covering from the cuticle, which accom- panies them to their pointed extremities: this covering I have not been able to trace, and rather doubt its existence from the following circumstance:—The hair in the progress of its growth, when it has passed through the cutis, is arrested in its passage by the cuticle, and will make several coils and turns underneath it—which it would not do, if its covering was in the nature of a prolongation extending from the cuticle. These may be readily seen on the back of the arm of a hairy person ; and on breaking away the superstructure of cuticle, the young hair will spring up, uncoil, and soon assume the direction of the neighbouring hairs. The length of the coiled hair, is from one to two-eighths of an inch. I am equally doubtful of the covering of cutis, said to ex- tend underneath the bulb, by a process passing in an opposite direction to the cuticle. In the larger hairs or bris- tles, the attachment is only at the anterior surface of the cutis, where the upper portion of the bulb and tubular parts are firmly enclosed. The hair presents several varieties of texture in the human subject, and is much more abundant in some situations than in others. Its greatest accumulation is upon the head, where it is much longer in the female than in the malej and by its flowing length and graceful curls, forms a prin- cipal feature of beauty. Hair of a stronger texture, and more inclined to short curls, forms the beard, which is found only in the male; while hair of intermediate texture grows in abundance on the pubes, on the scrotum, the labia, in the arm-pits, and, in the male, around the anus ; and more abundantly on the

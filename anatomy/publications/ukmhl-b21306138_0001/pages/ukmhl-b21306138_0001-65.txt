23 BONES OF THE HEAD. of the orbitar processes, upon their upper and outer part, behind the middle of the superciliary ridg-e, is a depressio7i for the lachrymal gland: a small pit may be seen behind the internal angular process, where the pulley is fixed for the tendon of the superior oblique muscle of the eye to play around. Betwixt the two orbitar processes there is a large fissure, into which the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone is admitted. The foramina, observable on the external surface of the os frontis, are three on each side:â€”One on each superciliary ridge, a little on the inner side of its centre, named the supra- orbitar foramen, which gives passage to a twig from the opthalmic branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and a small branch from the internal carotid artery, to be distributed to the integuments and muscles of the forehead: but this open- ing is often found as a notch only. Near the middle of the inside of each orbit, sometimes formed in the transverse su- ture, where that suture attaches the orbitar process of the frontal with the ethmoid bone, is situated the foramen orbi- tarium anterius, which transmits the nasal twig of the first branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and a branch of the opthalmic artery. About an inch behind this, the foramen orbitarium posterius is placed, which is smaller than the anterior one, and through it a small branch of the ocular artery passes to supply the dura mater. Besides these there are a great number of small holes, which mostly only pene- trate the first table, and admit of small vessels to the diploe, and the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses. The internal surface of the os frontis is concave, except at the orbitar processes, which are convex, to support the anterior lobes of the brain: its surface is not so smooth as the external, for the arteries of the dura mater, and the irre- gular surface of the brain, furrow it. Through the middle of the internal surface, on the anterior half, there is a ridge for the attachment of the falx major, and through the posterior half a sulcus for the lodgement of the superior longitudinal sinus. Immediately at the root of the ridge, anteriorly, there

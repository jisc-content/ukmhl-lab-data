162 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. navieulare. The external face forms a thin edge, which, in its centre, is furnished with a notch, marking the situation of the groove for lodging the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle. JUtachment of Muscles,â€”The m. adductor pollicis pedis, and flexor hrevis minimi digiti, are attached to the cuboid bone; and sometimes the flexor brevis pollicis pedis. The Metatarsal Bones Form the second division of the bones of the foot. They are five in number, and are placed between the tarsus and the toes: their form is cylindrical, and are thicker at their two ex- tremities than in the centre. The first, or metatarsal bone of the great toe, is the thickest, but the shortest of the five: it is divided into a jposterior or tarsal, and an anterior or digital extremity; and a middle part, or body. The tarsal extremity presents a concave articular surface, which is divided into a large superior and a smaller inferior portion, to be connected with the internal cuneiform bone; the circumference of this extremity is semilunar in form, being flattened externally, where it is connected with the metatarsal bone of the second toe ; convex and rough internally, for the attachment of ligaments: the inferior surface presents a tubercle, into which the tendon of the peroneus longus is inserted. The body of the bone is triangular and contracted. Its superior surface is convex, both from behind to before and from side to side. Its inferior surface is concave from be- hind to before, to preserve the longitudinal arch of the foot. The external surface is hollowed out, particularly in its centre, so as to leave a considerable space between it and the meta- tarsal bone of the second toe. The internal surface is flat- tened. The anterior, or digital extremity, is also called the head

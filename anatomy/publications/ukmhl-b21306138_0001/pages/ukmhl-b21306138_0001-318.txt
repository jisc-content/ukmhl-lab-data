25fj PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. enarthrodial articulation, admit of some slight degree of mo- tion upon each other; but yet this motion is rather to be considered as general, with respect to the whole hand, than in particular with the bones themselves. The direction in which their motion is permitted is extension and flexion ; the former taking place to a greater extent than the latter. There is also some slight degree of motion between each of the bones of the carpus, but so limited that it is rather to be con- sidered for the purpose of preventing injury to the hand from concussion, than to assist in the functions of the hand itself. Motions of the Metacarpus upon the Carpus. The four metacarpal bones admit of some slight degree of motion from before to behind. This cannot be described as flexion and extension only, allowing their surfaces to slide and not to turn upon the articulatory faces of the carpus. With this motion that of the bones of the metacarpus on each other may be included, which must necessarily admit of some sliding on themselves, to allow of their motion on the carpus. Motions of the Phalanges on the Metacarpus. In this description I include the motions of the thumb upon the carpus, having already stated the reasons for considering the thumb to be composed of three phalanges. The first phalanges of the four fingers execute a motion of flexion, ex- tension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction, upon the metacarpus; while that of the thumb moves upon the os trapezium of the digital row of the carpus, and enjoys a much more extensive motion than the others. The articu- lations between the first and second, and second and third phalanges of all the fingers, form complete hinge-joints, and admit therefore only of flexion and extension, the former to a much greater extent than the latter. If we consider the

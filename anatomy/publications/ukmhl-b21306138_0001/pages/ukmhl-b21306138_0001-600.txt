DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 21-4 rnon to this muscle and the extensor longus dig’itorum, poste- riorly, in common to it and the flexor digitorum communis. I'rom these orig-ins the fibres descend with slig’ht obliquity outwards, and at the lower part of the leg terminate in a tendon, which passes through a groove on the inner side of the malleolus externus ; then runs forward on the outer side of the os calcis; and reaching the os cuboides, continues through a deep groove in it which directs it inwards, above the muscles in the sole of the foot, to reach its insertion into the outer side of the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, and the os cuneiforme internum. It is better to leave the dissection of the insertion of this muscle, until the muscles situated on the sole of the foot have been examined. This muscle is superficially placed on the outer side of the fibula, being bounded anteriorly by the extensor longus digitorum, and posteriorly by the soleus and flexor longus pollicis; its tendinous insertion is covered by the muscles of the sole of the foot. Use.—To extend the ancle-joint, and to direct the outer edge of the foot upwards; in which action it is opposed by the tibialis posticus. The m. peroneus brevis—arises by short aponeuroses from the outer and posterior surface of the lower half of the fibula, and from the intermuscular tendons which connect it anteriorly with the extensor longus digitorum, and poste- riorly with the flexor longus pollicis; its fibres descend a little obliquely outwards, and at the lower part of the leg form a tendon, which passes behind the malleolus externus with the peroneus longus, then through a groove on the outer side of the calcis, above the tendon of the preceding muscle; it reaches the base of the metatarsal bone, sup- porting the little toe, into which it is inserted. The outer surface of this muscle is covered by the pero- neus longus ; it proceeds downwards, between the extensor longus digitorum, which is before it, and the flexor longus pollicis, behind it; at the malleolus externus, the tendon of this muscle is below that of the peroneus longus, but when

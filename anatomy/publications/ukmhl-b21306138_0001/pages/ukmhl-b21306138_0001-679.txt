GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. 293 sebaceous follicles make their appearance about the same time, and are seen, first about the head and face, and then in other parts of the body. About the seventh month, the skin is covered with a sebaceous secretion, which remains until the time of birth. In new-born children of Negroes, the skin is of a redder appearance than in Europeans; the black colour begâ€™ins to shew itself the moment the child respires, but is more particularly apparent towards the third day after birth ; first around the nails, nipples, organs of generation, anus, and eyes; about the seventh day, the colour becomes general. It may be here remarked, in addition to what has already been said on the subject, that the rete mucosum has* an intimate connection with respiration. The diseases of the skin, as might be supposed from the variety of functions which it performs, are very numerous, and seem principally to depend upon those causes which diminish the quantity and quality of its secretions: hence it is, that we fipd persons who take but little exercise, and consequently perspire but little, are the most liable to cuta- neous eruptions. These diseases put on various appearances, and are accompanied with such different symptoms, that those who have made them a subject of particular interest and study, have divided them into many orders, species, and varieties, which form a lengthened and intricate nomenclature. In injury to the cutis from mechanical lesion, there is a power of reproduction resident in the vessels of the skin ; and if the division has occurred from a cutting instrument, and the parts be brought in contact with each other, a union quickly occurs, which is termed adhesion by the first inten- tion ; a small cicatrix is formed by the deposition of coagu- lable lymph; and then the cuticle is quickly formed over it; gradually acquiring all the physical properties of the old skin. When the wound is extensive, the power of reparation is slower, and a better opportunity is afforded to watch the phenomena as they proceed ; they will be found to occur in the following order: first, the deposition of an agglu-

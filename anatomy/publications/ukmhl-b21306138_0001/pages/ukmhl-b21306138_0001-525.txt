DESCRimVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES^ 139 metacarpal bone of the ring- finger, along its whole length*; and its tendon is inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx and extensor tendon of the ring finger. It is covered by the lumbricales, and flexor profundus muscle. Use.—To extend the ring finger, and draw it when extended towards the middle finger. The m. interosseus annularis—arises from the root and radial side of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, and is inserted into the extensor tendon and outer side of the first phalanx of the same finger. It is placed immediately underneath the flexor brevis minimi digiti. Use.—To extend and draw the little finger towards the ring finger. The interossei externi—are those muscles situated on the back of the hand, between the metacarpal bones ; one on each side of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger and the third on the ulnar side of the ring finger. They each arise from two metacarpal bones, and are therefore sometimes called the interossei bicipetes. The m. prior medii digiti—arises from the roots of the metacarpal bones of the index and middle fingers, and passes to be inserted into the extensor tendon of the middle finger and radial side of the first phalanx. Its posterior surface is covered by the tendons of the ex- tensor digitorum communis, and by an aponeurosis pro- ceeding from one metacarpal bone to the other; and its anterior surface, which is much the narrower, is concealed by the adductor pollicis. Use.—To extend and abduct the middle finger. The m. posterior medii digiti—arises from the upper extremities of the metacarpal bones of the middle and ring fingers, and is inserted into the extensor tendon and ulnar side of the first phalanx of the middle finger.

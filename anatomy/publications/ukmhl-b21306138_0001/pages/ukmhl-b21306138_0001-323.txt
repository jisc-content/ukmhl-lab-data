ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS. 261 of the sacrum, and from the first bone of the os coccyg'is; then on either side passes outwards and downwards, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the ischium, being' there con- nected with the tendinous origin of the flexors of the leg. Upon the inner side of this portion of bone it extends itself into a ligamentous expansion, from the shape of wdiich it has gained the name of the falciform ligament, which runs up on the ascending ramus of the ischium, and forms a canal for the passage of the pudic artery, and also gives origin to the obturator internus muscle. From the posterior surface of this ligament arises the gluteus maximus muscle; its an- terior face is connected with the anterior sacro sciatic liga- ments, leaving a triangular space between them, which gives passage to the obturator internus muscle, and to the pudic vessels and nerves. The anterior sacro sciatic ligament is the smaller liga- ment of the two, but of the same form as the last described, before which it is situated. It arises, in common with the posterior hgament, from the ihum, sacrum, and os coccygis, being composed of the most anterior fibres; it passes for- wards and inwards, to be inserted into the spinous process of the ischium ; its posterior surface is covered by the posterior sacro sciatic ligament; its anterior gives origin to the coccy- geus muscle. These two ligaments divide the great sciatic notch into two openings; through the upper, which is the larger, passes the pyriformis muscle, the gluteal, and sciatic vessels and nerves; and through the inferior, the obturator internus muscles, with the pudic vessels and nerves. These ligaments exist not only for the purpose of connecting the bones of the pelvis, but also of sustaining its viscera, and diminishing the size of its openings. The sacro iliac ligaments connect the sacrum and ilium, both anteriorly and posteriorly, passing from the two upper bones of the former to the sides of the ilium, and thus en- veloping the intervening fibro-eartilaginous tissue ; the an- terior sacro iliac ligament is covered by the psoas magnus, and the posterior by the gluteus maximus muscle.

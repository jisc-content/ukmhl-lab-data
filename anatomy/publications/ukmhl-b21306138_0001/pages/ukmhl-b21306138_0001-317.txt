DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARHCDLATIONS. 2o5 phalanx of the five fing-ers, and their joints arc connected by anterior and lateral, which form capsular lig-aments, and by a lining’ synovial membrane. The anterior ligament is a half annular lig-ament, attached to the fore parts and sides of each metacarpal bone, immedi- ately below their intertransverse lig-aments, from whence it passes to be inserted into the superior extremity of each phalanx. It is in the thick part of this lig-ament that the sesamoid bones of the thumb are placed, between which its proper flexor muscle passes. The lateral ligaments proceed from the sides of the inferior extremity of the metacarpal bones, as far as to the sides of the superior part of the phalanges. These ligaments are connected with the sheaths which protect the tendons of the flexor muscles, and their edges are in contact with the vessels and nerves of the fingers. The synovial membrane covers the cartilaginous surface of the bones of the metacarpus, passes behind the anterior hgament and within the lateral, and surrounds the articular surface of the phalanx ; it then forms a loose capsule under the tendon of the extensor muscle. Articulation of the Phalanges. Class Diarthrosis.—Subdivision Ginglimus. The articulation of these bones with one another form a perfect hinge-joint; they have each a synovial capsule, an anterior, and two lateral ligaments, which, in situation and attachment, resemble so precisely those of the articulation of the phalanges with the metacarpus, as to render their des- cription unnecessary. Motions of the Carpus. The two rows of the carpus which have already been des- cribed, as forming in part an arthrodial and in part an

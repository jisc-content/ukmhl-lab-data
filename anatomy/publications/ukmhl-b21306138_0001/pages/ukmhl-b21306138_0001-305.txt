DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 243 with the motion of flexion and extension of the fore arm. 'Diere is but one lig-ament connecting- this joint, named The coronarxj ligament, which is composed of strong- and thick fasciculi, which arise from the posterior edge of the lesser sigmoid cavity of tlie ulna 5 it then passes around the neck of the radius, and is inserted into the anterior edge of the same cavity, thus forming three fourths of a circle, from which disposition it gains its name. This ligament passes in such close contact with the radius as to prevent any separa- tion, but is not adherent to it, and therefore allows of the free rotatory motion of that bone: it is fibrous in its tex- ture ; the fibres pass in a circular direction, and are more obvious at its extremities than in its centre. The external surface of this ligament is covered by the muscles arising- from the outer condyle of the humerus, and by the external lateral ligament: its internal surface is lined by the synovial membrane; which, as I before said, is continued from the elbow-joint. Its superior circumference is connected wdth most of the lig-aments of this articulation, while its inferior circumference is free. Middle Radio Ulnar Articulation. This connexion of the radius and ulna hardly deserves the name of an articulation, as the bones are not found in actual apposition. There are two ligaments which serve to connect the radius and ulna nearly their whole length; they differ in their figure and in their use; the upper one is a mere chord, w'hich extends transversely from one bone to the other, and assists in preventing their forcible separation ; the other is a broad ligament, which fills up the space produced by tbe natural separation of the radius from the ulna; and not only connects these bones, but also gives origin to many muscles, and thus becomes included within the seventh class. The oblique ligament is composed of thin fibrous fasciculi, w hich are rounded in their form, and originate on the outer side of the coronoid process of the ulna, just below the

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 229 and it may be remarked, that when these accidents do oc- cur, it is under circumstances where the muscles wâ€™ere not prepared to meet the force. At the same time, this combi- nation of force in several muscles allows of a change of action, one set relieving the other, or acting with increased or lessened force alternately, during long-continued exertion ; this is exemplified by the natural habit of resting alternately on one leg or the other when standing in the erect posture. Having noticed the particular action of muscles individu- ally, I shall now proceed to make some few observations on the muscular motions of the body in general. The efieets of muscular contraction upon the skeleton, are, to determine the attitudes and motions of the body, the movements of the skin, and the organs of the senses ; to regulate the voice; and, lastly, to contribute more or less to the performance of the vegetative functions, as the circu- lation of the blood and its various consequences. We shall, however, now more particularly dwell upon the various phenomena connected with locomotion, which are so essential to the animal economy that we find, even in the lower animals, the configuration of their bodies is in a great measure directed by it; as may be observed in the various forms of animals of different species. In the erect posture, as w'e have already mentioned, the whole of the muscles of the spine and joints of the lower extremity are called into action, so that by the continued co- operation of so many muscles at the same time, we find there is a great expenditure of muscular power, and energy, to pro- duce what apparently is a passive position ; for this reason it is that persons who are much debilitated by sickness, or age, cannot long remain in the standing attitude, and even wdth difficulty maintain the body in a half erect position. When standing firmly, the foot is pressed upon the ground by the flexores digitorum communes, by the flexores pollicis, the peroneus longus, tibialis posticus, and the muscles of the sole of the foot; by which action the pressure will be greatest at the heel and the toes: and owing to the arch

xxxm INTKODUCTORY LECTURE. o-aged our notice, are divisible into two classes—the me- chanical and the vital org-ans. Of the former class, the bones may be considered the org'ans of support, the lig-aments those of connexion, and the muscles those of motion; while the organs of the latter class respectively perform the functions of assimilation, circulation, exhalation, and secretion. In proceeding to consider the intellectual organs, which may be reg'arded as forming* a third class, we are to observe, that the wonderful structure which we have been contemplating would remain inert and passive, were there not a medium of com- munication between the faculties, comprehensively termed MIND, and the organs subjected to that act of the mind, denominated volition, or will. That this mental sove- reignty may be exercised, that the presiding intellect may be informed, and that its decrees may be executed by the subordinate agencies, man is furnished with a nervous sys- tem, consisting of brain, spinal marrow, and nerves, which, being acted upon by various sensations, produce impressions on the mind in its supposed residence or sensorium, the brain. I say its supposed residence; because, in tracing the connexion of matter with mind, we lose the clue of demon- stration, and have only strong inference or conjecture for our guide; that connexion, hke vitality itself, is a mystery which human reason cannot unveil. The'brain is situated in the head, in direct proximity, be it remembered, with the “ local habitation” of four of the five senses: the spinal marrow is placed in the vertebral column, and the nerves are distri- buted through every part of the body. These three grand divisions of the nervous system are more or less connected with each other, and are reciprocally subservient. The im- pressions of which the brain is susceptible have been dis- tributed into five classes, corresponding with the five senses: but it would be more correct to say, that each of these senses communicates its peculiar class of impressions. The sense of touch, for instance, conveys to us the notions of rough- ness, smoothness, hardness, softness, and many other qua- lities ; and the same observation may apply, in a greater or

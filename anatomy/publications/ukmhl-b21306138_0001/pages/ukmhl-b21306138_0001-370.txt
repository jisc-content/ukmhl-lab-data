308 THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. The articulation of the leg with the thigh, as.sisted by the patella, form the knee-joint, which may be considered as the most complicated in the body, in consequence of the nume- rous and strong ligâ€™aments which surround it. It has been mentioned, that this joint, when a little bent, admits of a slight degree of rotatory motion; and this is performed by the internal condyle turning on its own axis on the inner articular face of the tibia, while the external condyle moves backward and forwards; but the rotation is allowed to a greater degree outwards than inwards, from the mode of the attachment of the crucial ligaments. The outward twisting of the leg is of use in progressive motion, by allowing the foot to form a broader base for sup- port ; whilst, at the same time, it is favourable to the action of crossing the legs. The obliquity of the knee-joint in- wards serves to encrease the elasticity of the lower extremity, and consequently to diminish the effects of concussion, by throwing the w'eight from the perpendicular line of the femur. It is further useful in leaping, by producing the force caused by the sudden extension of the joints acting- nearer to the centre of gravity. The/oo^, which is composed of the tarsus, metatarsus, and phalanges, forms a beautifully constructed elastic arch, suffi- ciently strong to support the w hole weight of the body, and at the same time sufficiently pliable to prevent its sustaining injury from concussion under the most violent exertions. These ends are effected not only by the various bones of the foot forming numerous articulations, and these being fur- nished w'ith elastic cartilages, but also by the foot itself forming a longitudinal arch, reaching from the posterior extremity of the os calcis to the anterior extremity of the metatarsal bones. The most convex part of this arch is situated at the upper part or dorsum of the foot, and is formed by the astragalus, Avhich receives the wnight of the body through its articulation with the tibia and fibula ; so that the astragalus may be considered as the key-stone to the arch, rendered better able to bear the great pressure to

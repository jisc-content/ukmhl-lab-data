THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 118 situation, by means of wetted pasteboards. Passive motion should be employed, after the lapse of three weeks, to counteract any disposition to anchylosis. When the external condyle is fractured, swelling, inability to perform the motions of the elbow-joint, and crepitus, are the diagnostic marks. Here the crepitus is most perceptible when the patient is desired to at- tempt the rotatory motions of the hand. Wlien a large portion of the condyle is broken off, it is drawn somewhat upwards and backwards. The treatment is the same as in fracture of the internal condyle. Paste- board splints best answer the purpose in these accidents. The Fore-Arm Forms the third division of the superior extremity, and is composed of two bones, the radius and the ulna. The Radius. The radius is shorter than the ulna by a length equal to that of the olecranon; it is placed on the outer side of the arm, is continued on the same line with the humerus, and reaches from the elbow to the wrist-joint. It is of a cylindri- cal form, and is divided into a body, neck, tubercle, and two extremities. The upper extremity, or head, presents a rounded cup-formed articulatory sUrface, which is covered with cartilage, and receives the external condyle of the hu- merus, thus entering into the composition of the elbow^-joint. This cavity is surrounded by a projecting lip of bone, wâ€™hich presents upon its inner side a cartilaginous surface, having its long axis and convexity from before to behind, and is re- ceived into the smaller sigmoid cavity of the ulna, thereby producing the superior radio-ulnar articulation. Immediately below the head, the bone becomes contracted, forming the neck, which is rounded and smooth, to allow the bone to move readily within the coronary ligament. Just below the neck, on the inner and fore part of the bone, is placed the tu- bercle, a projecting rough surface of bone, for the tendinous insertion of the biceps muscle. Below this process is tire body.

descriptive anatomy of articulations. 227 extremity of the acromion, and expose a surface for the ten- dinous .insertion of the trapezius, and for the origin of the deltoid muscles, from which they are sufficiently distinct. Inferior ligament.—This ligament, anteriorly, is in con- tact with the preceding; it then passes on the under sur- faces of the clavicle and acromion, but does not extend so far backwards as to be connected with the posterior edge of the superior ligament; its inferior surface is in contact with the infra spinatus muscle, while its superior surface is connected with the synovial membrane of this articulation. It is so loose as to allow of some degree of motion independently of the scapula. * Synovial membrane covers the articular surfaces of both bones, but secretes very little synovia; it is sometimes di- vided into two cavities by an interarticular cartilage; this, however, is but of rare occurrence. Junction between the Clavicle and Coracoid Process of the Scapula; or, Coraco Clavicular Union. This union is formed by two lig’aments, which connect the clavicle with the coracoid process. They arise by a single origin from the coracoid process, but separate into two por- tions to be inserted into the clavicle, which admits of their being described as two distinct ligaments—the conoid and the trapezoid. The conoid is the posterior and internal of the two; it is of a conical form, with its base upwards, which is attached to the tubercle at the under part of the clavicle, its apex being connected with the coracoid process. The trapezoid is anterior and external; it is broader than the conoid ligament, but not so strong; it extends from the middle of the convexity of the coracoid process, passes up- wards and outwards, and is attached to the under surface of the scapular extremity of the clavicle, close to the connexion of this bone with the acromion. The connexion of these

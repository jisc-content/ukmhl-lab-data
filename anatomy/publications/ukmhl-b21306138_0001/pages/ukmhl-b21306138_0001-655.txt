GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE, 269 fact, that immediate ease is obtained by such surg-ical means as relieve pressure upon the part. The chemical composition of the cellular membrane is diliicult to trace, in consequence of its intermixture with blood-vessels, absorbents, and nerves. It consists princi- pally of g-elatine and mucus. By boilingâ€™, it by degrees will dissolve to gelatine; this is exemplified by the boiling of flesh, when the fibres of the muscle become separated into distinct fasciculi as the cellular membrane is dissolved. The functions of the cellular membrane, independent of the support and free motion which it affords to the different structures of the body, consists of various secretions and absorptions. It is probable, that the insensible perspiration, at all times carried on, forms one of the principal excretories of its secretions ; from which circumstance, there is a resem- blance between the cellular and mucous membranes: but as absorption, as well as secretion, is constantly carried on, in that respect its functions resemble more those of serous membranes; hence there is a difliiculty in assigning it to either class. The secretion of serum in the living body, is in a state of vapour, or halitus, as may be seen on opening the body of an animal recently slain; this vapour quickly condenses on exposure to the atmosphere. The accumulation of this secretion, whether depending on the diminished action of the absorbents, or the excessive deposition from the arteries, produces anasarca ; such collections are found most exten- sive in all situations where the cellular membrane is lax, and in abundance, particularly in the eyelids, prepuce, and scrotum; but where the cells are composed of dense and short fibres, they seldom or never fill, either in emphysema or anasarca. This is particularly the case in all the sub- mucous and subserous cellular distributions ; in the palms of the hands, and in the soles of the feet. And it may be further remarked, that in these situations, as well as around blood-vessels, the cellular membrane not only differs in the

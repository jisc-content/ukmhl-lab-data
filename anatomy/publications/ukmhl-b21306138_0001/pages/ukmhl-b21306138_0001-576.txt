190 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. This muscle covers the iliac fossa, the articulations of the femur, and the upper part of the orig-in of the rectus ; it is covered above the crural arch, within the pelvis, by the coecum on the right, and the sigmoid flexion of the colon on the left; below the crural arch, it is bounded by the sartorius on its outer side, by the pectinaeus and crural vessels and nerves on its inner side. The cellular membrane m the bend of the groin separates it from the crural apo- neurosis anteriorly. Use.—To flex the trunk and pelvis, or to bend the thigh directly forwards. The m. pectineus—is a flattened triangplar muscle, arising from the pubes, in a space extending from the spine of that bone outwards and backwards, along the linea ilio pectinea; being attached to the fore part of Gimbernat’s ligament; from thence it descends, passing in front of the obturator foramen, with an obliquity downwards, backwards, and outwards, to be inserted by a flat thin tendon into the linea aspera, immediately below the trochanter minor, and behind the vastus internus. This muscle is covered by the femoral vessels, and anterior crural nerve, which are however separated from it by an interval which is filled up with cellular membrane; it lies upon the pubes, obturator externus, and origin of the adductor brevis muscle; its inner edge is covered by the adductor longus, and its outer edge is parallel with the psoas magnus; it is inserted immediately below the psoas and iliacus, and above the adductor brevis. Use,—This muscle flexes the thigh upon the pelvis, slightly as- sists in the adduction of the limb, and performs in some measure the office of a rotator outwards.—The principal action, however, of the three muscles of the hip-joint just enumerated, are, to flex the thigh upon the pelvis; and are-termed therefore the three progressors, being particularly in action during progressive motion. These muscles are covered on their anterior surfaces by the fascia iliaca, which passes down to form the posterior layer of the sheath of the femoral vessels; being above, at

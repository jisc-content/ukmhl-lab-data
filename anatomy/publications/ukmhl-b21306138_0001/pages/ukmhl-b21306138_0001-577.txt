DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 191 the dlaphragrn, connected with the fascia transversalis, and on the outer edge of the iliacus muscle, with the anterior layer of the fascia lumborum. The progress of the dissection now requires that the glutei muscles, which are the extensors and abductors of the hip, and being exterior to so many other muscles, should ne.xt be described. For this purpose the subject must be placed prone, and the pelvis raised so as to place these muscles in a comparative state of extension. The fibres of the gluteus maximus will be exposed in their course by an incision made from the sacro iliac symphisis to the trochanter major. The m. glutceus maximusâ€”arises from the posterior third of the outer labium of the crista of the ilium, from the posterior sacro iliac ligament, from a tendon common to it, the latissimus dorsi and sacro lumbalis, from the outer side of the sacrum, and side of the sacro coccygeal ligament, from the side of the os coceygis, and from the posterior sacro sciatic hgament; from these different origins the fibres pass obliquely outwards, downwards, and forwards, forming a strong thick fleshy muscle of large bundles of fasciculi, distinctly separated by cellular membrane; passes over the trochanter major, where it is furnished with a bursa mucosa, and over the tuberosity of the ischium ; after which its fibres, being firmly attached to the fascia lata, converge to be inserted tendinous into the linea aspera, beginning immedi- ately below the trochanter, and extending three inches down that line ; the tendon being furnished with one or tw'O small bursae between it and the femur. The glutaeus maximus is superficial, and forms the greater bulk of the nates ; its outer surface is covered by the inte- guments, and a very thin layer of fascia lata. It covers at its upper part portions of the ilium, sacrum, and os coccygis, posterior half of the glutaeus medius, pyriformis, geraini, and obturator internus muscles; lower down it covers the tro- chanter major on the outer side where it is connected with the tensor vaginae femoris, the tuberosity of the ischium on

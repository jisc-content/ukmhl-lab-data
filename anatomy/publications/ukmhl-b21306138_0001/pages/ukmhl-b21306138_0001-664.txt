LECTURE XXI. GENERAL ANATOMY OP THE SKIN OR COMMON INTEGUMENTS. Under this title, we shall consider those integuments which form the exterior covering of the body ; and although many anatomists and physiologists have classed the mucous membranes as a continuation of the same structure; their variety of function is so great, that the mere circumstance of the imperceptible blending of the one into the other, is hardly sufficient to identify them as being the same. On the contrary, there is a marked difference both in the physical and vital properties, between a surface destined to be in contact with atmospheric air, and a surface lubricated by mucus, which enables them to bear the contact of fluids, and stimulants of various descriptions. The line of demarkation between the tegumentory coverings of the exterior and interior of the body, is sufficiently obvious; as in the eyes, nose, lips, anus, and in those situations where mucous se- cretions commence; although the cuticle, or external layer of the skin, does proceed and may be traced into the interior of some of those cavities which are exposed to a variety of stimulants, as in,the alimentary canal. It is further distinguished from the mucous membranes by con- taining fewer blood-vessels, and by being more dense. The skin is the strong elastic external covering of the body, formed both to afford support, and to allow of the free motions of its several parts. It is found to cover the whole of the external surface of the body, but presents varieties of structure in different situations ; on the posterior surface of the body, it is thicker than on the anterior, and on the external surface of the limbs than on the internal; and /

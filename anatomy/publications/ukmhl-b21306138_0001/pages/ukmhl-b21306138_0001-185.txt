120 BONES OF.THE EXTREMITIES. rounded and roug'hencd, for the attachment ol the lateral Jijj-ament. Use.—From its position in front of the carpus, it completes the trans- verse carpal arch; and thus protects the vessels, nerves, and tendons, in their passage to the fingers. Attachment of Muscles.—This bone receives the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and gives origin to the abductor minimi digiti. The ligamentum carpi uluare is also attached to it. The Digital Row. 'I'he four bones of the dig-ital row are placed in the following order, beginning from the radial side: the trapezium, trape- zoides, magnum, and unciform. Os Trapezium. The os trapezium is irregular in its form, but somewhat resembles the mathematical figure from which it has derived its name : it presents four articular, and two non-articular surfaces. The superior surface forms a slight concavity, to connect it with the scaphoid bone. Its inferior, or digital surface, is sharp, and terminates rather to its inner side in a small articular face, which is lengthened from before to behind, and receives a part of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger. Its outer articular surface, which is the largest, is concave from above to below, and convex from before to behind ; and is articulated with the first phalanx of the thumb. Internally, it is connected with the trapezoid bone, and presents, therefore, an articular surface for that purpose. Its anterior, or palmar non-articular surface, is rough for the attachment of ligaments, and has a deep gToove traversing it from without to within, and from above to below, for the passage of tlie m. flexor, carpi radialis.

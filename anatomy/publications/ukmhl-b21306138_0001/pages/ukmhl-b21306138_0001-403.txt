GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 17 for, as thore are antag’onists to every muscle, an elastic substance surrounding- them, and also the laws of gravity acting- upon them in their quiescent state,—all these may be considered as forces producing the relaxation after the con- traction of muscular fibre, which, consequently, cannot be considered as mere cessation of contraction only. Having now spoken of the irritability of muscular fibre, which means its susceptibility to receive impressions from stimuli; we have now to describe what are the kind of stimulants wliich produce contraction of muscle, and through what medium they communicate the impression. The kind of stimulants have by many physiologists been divided into vital, mechanical, and chemical. Those of the first class act through the medium of the brain, and consist of the influence of the will, and such violent emotions of the mind as are termed passions ; but in order that the will may operate as a stimulus to a muscle, it is necessary that there be a direct communication between the muscle and the brain by means of a nervous cord. The following facts prove this assertion:—if we will, for instance, to flex the arm, its muscles immediately contract and pro- duce that action, so long as their nerves are connected through the medium of the spinal marrow with the brain ; but if these nerves be separated from the spinal cord, although the brain has still the power to will the motion, yet its influence upon the muscles ceases, and the limb remains incapable of motion from vital stimuli, although mechanical or chemical stimuli acting upon the divided nerve will yet produce an involuntary action of the muscles : this latter phenomenon only lasts, however, for a short time after the nerve has been separated from the centre of the nervous system. The passions seem to produce an immediate effect upon all the muscles of the body, both of the voluntary and involuntary class. Of the mechanical stimuli, their application, even from the slightest touch to the greatest degree of violence, will produce the contraction of muscle, whether it be applied to c

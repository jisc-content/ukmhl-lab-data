230 UESCUIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. thus strongly maintained in the foot, we are enabled to incline the body cither forwards or backwards, so as mate- rially to lessen the fatigue of standing. When carrying heavy burdens, or in consequence of some other great exer- lion of the body, the longitudinal arch of the foot is dimi- nished, and flattened, and at the same time the foot directed inwards, it presents a larger surface in contact with the ground, which principally enables the individual to stand with greater security. Standing on tiptoes is effected by the strong extensors of the ancle-joint raising the heel from the ground, while the flexors on the sole of the foot are pressing the toes down- wards ; the extensors of the toes and flexors of the ancle- joint are in action at the same time to bring the tibia forwards within the centre of gravity. Walking is less fatiguing than standing, in consequence of the frequent change which takes place in the exertion of different muscles, during which they are alternately in a state of rest and action. Walking is effected, first, by throwing the weight of the body upon one lower extremity, w'hich sets the other at liberty; then the flexors of the hip- joint, by flexing the thigh upon the pelvis, raise the foot from the ground; next the four extensors of the knee-joint advance the leg, while the extensors of the ancle-joint point the advanced foot: the muscles of the opposite firmly fixed limb, having their purchase on the ground, bend the trunk forwards in an oblique direction, so as to throw the weight towards the extended limb, which now receives it, carries it to the ground, where its principal force is met upon the heel, from whence it is transmitted to the rest of the foot; and the body is further advanced by the propelling action of the other foot on leaving the ground, and which, in its turn, goes through the same motions. In the transmission of the weight of the body from the heel to the toes, the foot forms a parabolic curve, which, together with tlie arches of the foot, materially diminishes the concussion which would otherwise occur.

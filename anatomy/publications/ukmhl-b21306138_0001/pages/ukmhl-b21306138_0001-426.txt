40 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. each, as to render this elementary work, if possible, useful alike to the reading- student and to the practical anatomist. It is my intention, with this view, in the first place to specify numerically the muscles of particular parts and reg'ions of the body, with corresponding- numerical subdivisions, accord- ing- to their origins and insertions, as well as to then- respective and combined uses: thus, for instance, in the description of the muscles of the upper extremity, it may be first observed, that there are fifty-one muscles which g-ive motion to the bones of the arm ; but as these bones form numerous joints, the muscles must secondly be divided in such a manner as to specify what joints each set are destined to move ; so that, in the second place, they may be sub- divided into the seven muscles connecting- the scapula to the trunk, the nine muscles of the shoulder-joint, the four muscles of the elbow, the four muscles of the radio-ulnar articulations, the six muscles of the wrist-joint, the five muscles common to the fingers, the eight muscles proper to the thumb, two of the fore finger, three muscles of the little finger, and one common to the skin and fascia of the palm of the hand; by this arrangement both the muscle and uses of each set of muscles is understood ; but yet, has to be learnt, the origin and insertion of each muscle, and their relative position with respect to each other: a knowledge which can only be acquired by dissection. Now, to facilitate this mode of investigation by description, a third and further division must be adopted to lead the student prog-res- sively on to the desired object: thus for instance, in dissect- ing the muscles of the scapula, his task is rendered easier by knowing that there are two muscles situated above the scapula to raise that bone, three placed behind to draw it backwards, and two in front and on its inner side to draw it forwards and towards the trunk. By prosecuting the dis- section of the muscles according to this classification, the relative position of the muscles is necessarily learnt as well as their attachment; and the dissector learns that all these muscles arise from the bones of the trunk, and are inserted

LECTURE IX. DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. Articulations of the Head and Spine. The sutural connexions of the bones of the head and face having- already been spoken of, the only articulation proper to the head which remains to be described, is the temporo- maxillary. Articulation of the Lower Jaw. Class Diarthrosis.â€”Subdivision Arthrodia. The inferior maxillary hone forms a double articulation with the temporal bones, the condyloid processes of the for- mer being received into the anterior division, or fossa condy- loidea, of the glenoid cavity of the latter. This cavity is bounded, behind, by the fissura glasseri, which separates it from the fossa parotidea ; and before, by the root of the zy- gomatic arch, which presents a transverse ridge, marking the extent of its articulatory surface. The glenoid cavity, and that part of the root of the zygoma included in the articu- lation, are covered by a thin cartilage. The condyles of the lower jaw have their long axis from side to side, and are also covered by articular cartilage, presenting a larger surface before than behind: they do not precisely correspond in shape with the glenoid cavity, in consequence of the inter- position of an interarticular fibro-cartilaginous tissue, which forms a thin layer, transversely oval, presenting a broad su- perior and inferior surface, which, under the different motions of the jaw, adapt themselves to the surfaces of the two bones.

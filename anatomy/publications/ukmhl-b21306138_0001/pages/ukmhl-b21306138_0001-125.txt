BONES OF THE TRUNK. 81 proportionate size to the whole of the bone, has its long axis from side to side, and is slightly concave from behind to be- fore, both upon its superior and inferior surfaces. Their articulatory processes are large and elongated : the superior are concave, oval in form, and are directed backwards and inwards, having rather a tendency to diverge: the inferior, on the contrary, rather converge, are convex, oval, and face forwards and outw^ards, admitting a considerable degree of lateral motion. Their spinous process is large, long, takes a horizontal direction backwards, and is flattened laterally. The transverse processes are thin, long, and pass horizontally outwards, having a slight inclination upwards: they are placed on a plane anterior to the transverse processes of the dorsal region. Their spinal hole is large and triangular; and their notches form very deep sulci. The fifth lumbar vertebra may be known from the rest of this region by having the lower surface of its body oblique, so that the anterior part of its body is much deeper than the posterior: and also, from having the extremity of its spinous process hooked downw^ards towards the sacrum. The Spinal Column. The union of these twenty-four bones constitutes the ver- tebral column : the use of which is, to support the head, to form a part of the chest, to protect the spinal marrow, and to offer an extended surface for the attachment of muscles. Of the mechanism by which it is so perfectly adapted to its numerous offices, I shall defer to treat, until I come to speak of the skeleton in general: for the functions of the spinal column can be neither appreciated nor understood, by abstract and insulated considerations. It ought, however, to be borne in mind, that the spine forms the great medium of connexion between all the parts of the body ; and that, necessarily, numerous muscles are attached to its whole length.

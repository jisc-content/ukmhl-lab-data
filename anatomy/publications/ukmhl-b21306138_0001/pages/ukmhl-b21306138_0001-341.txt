ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. 279 preceding’, being’ placed behind the articulation ; its fibres are less strong’, but support is afforded to it by the popliteus muscle, by which it is covered. A synovial membrane lines the internal surface of both these lig’aments, as well as the cartilag’inous surface of the bones. Notwithstanding’ the firmness of this junction, there is some slight degree of motion, from before to behind, between the upper extremities of the tibia and fibula ; luxation does some- times occur, either from relaxation of its lig’aments, or the application of force, and the fibula may, from either of these causes, be thrust backwards ; it is, however, easily replaced, but with difficulty retained in its situation, in consequence of the action of the biceps muscle ; a strap should therefore be firmly applied, to retain it in its situation. I had an opportunity of seeing’ this accident at Guy’s Hos- pital, which was admitted under the care of my colleague and relative Mr. Key. In this there was a compound'dislo- cation of the head of the fibula backwards from the tibia, attended with fracture of the fibula ; the bone was so com- minuted as to require the removal of its dislocated head: nevertheless, the patient recovered without sustaining' any important alteration in the functions of the limb. Middle Fibulo Tibial Articulation. The tibia and fibula are connected nearly throug’hout their whole course by the interosseous ligament, which, as in the fore arm, fills up the natural separation of the two bones. It presents an aponeurotic expansion, composed of oblique fibres, which extend from within to w'ithout, arising' from the external edge of the tibia, and passing to the inner spine of the fibula, terminating below on that bone, so that it extends lower on the outer than on the inner side ; and, as it forms an opening just above its termination, its lowest fibres, which pass from the inner side of the external malleolus to the tibia.

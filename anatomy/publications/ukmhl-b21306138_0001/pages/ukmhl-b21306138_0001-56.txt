THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 14 medullary membrane of the bone; -whilst the latter, or earthy particles, are deposited by those of the periosteum or external investing- membrane of bone. These two distinct constituents’ of bony substance may be easily demonstrated. For this pur- pose, if a portion of bone be exposed to a great heat, its animal particles will be consumed, leaving- only an earthy residium: whilst, on the other hand, if bone be submitted to the action of dilute (nitric) acid, its earthy particles will be removed, and with them the hardness and density of the bone, although the remaining animal matter will be sufficient to retain the original form of the bone. Of course it is according to the preponderance of the earthy over the animal particles, that constitutes the relative hardness of bones; whilst their deficiency proves a cause of morbid softness. It ought, however, to be observed, that the bones of the foetus are naturally soft from a preponderance of animal matter, as has already been shewn when speaking on the subject of the physiology of bone.—^The following is the analysis of bone, as given by Bergehus. Cartilage 34 17 Fluate of hme 2 00 Phosphate of hme 51 04 Carbonate of lime 11 30 Phosphate of magnesia ..... 1 16 Soda, muriate of soda and water . . 1 20 Messrs. Fourcroy and Vanquehn state, that phosphate of magnesia, which is found in the bones of the lower animals, does not exist in the bones of the human subject; whilst, on the other hand, this salt is found in human urine, but not in that .of brutes. The relative proportion in the constituent parts of bone is not the same throughout the skeleton, nor even in one and the same bone at different periods of life. It is to these cir- cumstances that are to be ascribed the sensible changes observed to take place, as well in the color as in the texture of bone, at the different ages of the human subject. Thus we find tliem blue and soft, in infancy; white and hard, in

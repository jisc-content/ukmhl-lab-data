59 bones of the mead. The Os Vomer Is an irregular square bone situated in the median line of the face, and forms the principal part of the bony septum of the nose. It presents four edges taking- an oblique direction from behind to before, and two surfaces. The superior edge, the thickest, forms a deep groove to receive the azygos process of the sphenoid bone, offering the best example of articulation by schindylesis: the inferior edge is thinner and longer, and is connected to the nasal spines of the superior maxillary and palate bones. Its an- terior edge forms a deep sulcus, to be joined posteriorly to the nasal lamella of the ethmoid bone, and anteriorly with the cartilage, completing the septum of the nose. The posterior edge is somewhat rounded, turned towards the pharynx, and separates the posterior openings of the two nasal cavities. The surfaces of this bone form the inner boundary of the nose. Connexion.—The bone is thus connected above, with the sphenoid; below, with the superior maxillary and palate bones; and, before, with the ethmoid. Its posterior edge divides the bony cavity of the nose; and thus forms a septum to the nares, as they open into the pharynx. The Vomer sometimes has an opening through from one nostril to the other. The Ossa Turhinata Inferiora. These bones offer a very considerable addition to the cavity of the nose, without increasing the size of that organ, by affording a greater extent of surface for the attachment of the pituitary membrane. They are’very similar in shape to the superior turbinated bones, and have their convexities turned inwards. From the superior edge extend two processes ; the

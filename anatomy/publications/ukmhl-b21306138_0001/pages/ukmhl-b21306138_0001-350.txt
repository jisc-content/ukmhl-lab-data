288 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. Articulation of the cuneiform hones.—The cuneiform bones are attached to each other at their sides, each presentr- ing’ an articular surface, which is covered by synovi&l mem- brane, and strengthened by three superior and three inferior ligaments. The superior ligaments pass transversely from one bone to the other, forming a species of interosseous ligament. The inferior ligaments are precisely similar in their course, but are situated in the plantar region of the foot. Articulation of the tarsus and metatarsus.—The three first bones of the metatarsus are articulated with the cunei- form bones ; and the two last, or outer ones, with the cuboid. Their articular surfaces are covered with cartilage [and syno- vial membrane, and are further united by dorsal and plantar ligaments. The dorsal ligaments are composed of thick, short, paral- lel fibres, three of which pass from the superior part of the cuneiform bones, to be attached to the extremities of the metatarsal bones ; and the outer ones pass in the same man- ner, from the superior surface of the cuboid bone, to the two outer metatarsal bones. The plantar ligaments are also five in number, and are disposed precisely in the same manner. Articulation of the metatarsus.—All the bones of the metatarsus, excepting the first, are in contact with each other at their superior extremities, and present small arti- cular surfaces, which are covered with synovial membrane, and maintained in their respective positions by dorsal and plantar ligaments, of which there are three on each region, passing transversely from one bone to the other, excepting from the first to the second. The interosseous ligaments are also situated between the metatarsal bones, and serve to strengthen the articu- lation of these bones, and to give origin to the interossei muscles. Transverse ligament.—The anterior extremities of the metatarsal bones are united by this ligament, which passes

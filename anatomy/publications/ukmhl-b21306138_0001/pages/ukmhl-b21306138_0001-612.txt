220 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, to the humeri; hence we should be inclined to believe, that luxation would be much more liable to occur in the hip than in the shoulder, from the greater weight it has to sustain, and the more frequent occurrence of violent exertion. The manner, however, in which the heads of the femora are surrounded by the acetabula, and the angle at which (by the obliquity of the neck) they are connected with the shaft of the bone, tends materially to lessen the frequency of dislocation. The student, to comprehend the great variety of action in the muscles of the hip-joint during its motions, should not detach them until he has examined with careful atten- tion the following combinations; as in the reciprocal con- traction of the flexors and abductors, adductors and ex- tensors, extensors and adductors, then adductors and flexors; which succession of combination, produces circumduction of the limb. As in the upper extremity the motions of the joints are more limited as they descend, so in the lower extremities, the motions of the knee are less extensive and varied than in the joint above. The motions of the knee, are flexion and extension, for which difierent sets of muscles are provided; but inde- pendent of flexion and extension, the exertion of these muscles is constantly called forth, in conjunction with those of the hip, to maintain the erect position of the body, by fixing the knee-joint, and confining the condyles of the femur in a steady position upon the head of the tibia; for this purpose, muscles surround the joint in every direction. The muscles of the knee-joint, are flexors and extensors. The flexors are the gracilis, sartorius, semimembranosus, semitendinosLis, biceps, and poplitseus, assisted by the gas- trocnemius, and plantaris, muscles of the ancle-joint; while, through the medium of the fascia lata, the glutaius maximus and tensor vaginae femoris may be said to cooperate. The extensors are the rectus, crurmus, and two vasti, assisted bj' the tensor vaginae femoris and glutoeus maximus;

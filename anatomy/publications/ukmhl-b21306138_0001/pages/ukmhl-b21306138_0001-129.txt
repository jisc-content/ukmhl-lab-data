83 BONES OF THE TRUNK, respiration experience. The late Mr. Henry Cline recommended the removal of the depressed portion of the vertebra, upon the same principle that trephining is employed in fractures of the skull; and he performed the operation in one case, hut unsuccessfully. Mr. Frederic Tyrrell has since performed it in two instances, with a like want of success. Vide Plate 2, FigA., in which the position of the spinous process of the fractured vertebra is delineated. Second Division of the Trunk. The Thorax. 'Fhe chest is a larg'e conoidal cavity, placed anterior to the twelve dorsal vertebrae; it is composed of bones, to give it firmness ; of cartilage, to render it flexible; and of ligaments, to tie those parts together. The bones which enter into its composition may be thus enumerated;â€”The sternum, form- ing the anterior boundary, and placed in the median line of the body: and twelve ribs, situated on each side of it, which are more or less connected with the sternum in front, and with the twelve dorsal vertehree behind. The dorsal vertebraj form the posterior boundary to the chest. The Sternum. This bone is situated in the middle line of the body, and is divided in early life into three portions, which are not con- nected with each other by bone until the adult period. They are, however, so firmly united by cartilage as to move, during respiration, as a single bone. The upper piece of the sternum is somewhat of a triangular form, the base being placed above, and the apex below. It is, superiorly, notched, so as to give it somewhat the appear- ance of a heart: on each side of which notch is situated an articulatory surface, for the junction of the clavicles. On each of its lateral edges are placed one whole and one half

191 FIBRO-CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE, when no longer under tlie influence of muscular action. Its elasticity is further illustrated by the readiness with which the symmetry of these parts is restored, after contortion produced by the formation of abscess, tumour, or any cause subjecting them to pressure. The second class, or the articular fibro-cartilages, seem destined, from their elasticity, to prevent concussion of the bones; from their flexibility, to admit of the motions of the joint; and from the density of their texture, to afford strength and security. We find them separating the synovial mem- brane into two distinct sacs, in such joints where they are for the purpose of increasing the extent of motion, and in a manifest degree adding to the stability of the articulation. The terapero-maxillary, the sterno-clavicular, the inferior radio-ulnar articulations, offer the best examples of these cartilages ; but there may also be added the semilunar carti- lages of the knee-joint, which may be considered as an im- perfect specimen, as they are two in number; and instead of completely separating the bones, and dividing the joint into two synovial cavities, merely project into the articulation, and are covered on both surfaces by the same synovial mem- brane. If, however, we consider these two semilunar carti- lages as forming one complete cartilage of a circular form, we shall then find that they bear a strong analogy to a variety which occasionally takes place in the more perfect joints of a similar character, namely, where an opening is found to exist through the interarticular cartilage, which forms a communication between the synovial capsule of the one side and that on the other ; or in other words, by allow- ing a continuity of the lining membrane, throws into one what would otherwise be two .shut cavities, distinctly sepa- rated from each other. But it is not only in the moveable joints above described that we find the existence of this second class of fibro-carti- lage, since it is likewise employed for the purpose of con- necting bone immediately with bone, under those circum- stances where considerable motion is required, together with

GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. 271 limited by a wall of adhesive inflammation, which sooner or later circumscribes the matter, according* to the state of health of the individual. When abscess is of slow formation, its cavity is sometimes lined with a membrane, presenting* a secreting* surface, connected to the surrounding* parts by a compact cellular membrane ; such is particularly the case in fistulas and sinusesâ€”these are difficult to obliterate, until, by injection or division, a new character is g*iven to their surfaces. Inflammation of the cellular membrane sometimes ter- minates in the death of the part, when nature immediately endeavours to set up the process of separation ; but, from the unyielding* nature of the skin, this process is slow and tedious, and hig*h constitutional irritation follows, generally accompanied with diminished power: such is the state in carbuncle, the means of treating which, consists in early crucial incisions through the skin, stimulating poultices, and every remedy which will hasten the separation of the dead part, and check the ill effects of constitutional irritation. Elephantiasis, a disease common in the West Indies, has its seat in the cellular membrane, and is produced by the deposition of a gelatinous fluid into its cells, which increases the bulk of the diseased limb to an enormous size. It is not improbable, that this disease is owing to a specific in- flammation depending on a derangement of the perspiratory function ; the climates in which it is mostly found, are those which produce the most violent perspiration ; and sudorifics, which tend to restore this function of the cellular membrane and the skin, are the remedies most beneficial in its treatment. The importance of the function of this structure is proved by the remarkable manner in which it sympathises with the diseases of different,though distant organs; particularly those connected with respiration, and urinary secretion. This is also witnessed by the great proportion of the chronic diseases of the heart, liver, and spleen, terminating in anasarcous effusions.

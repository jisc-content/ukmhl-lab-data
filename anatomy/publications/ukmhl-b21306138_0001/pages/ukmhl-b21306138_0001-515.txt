DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 129 ments, to be iTisertecl into the back part of the metacarpal bone of the little fing-er. This muscle is superficially situated 5 from its origj’in it passes down between the extensor digitorum communis and flexor carpi ulnaris, being' separated however from the latter muscle by the internal ridg-e of the ulna. Use.—To extend the wrist-joint, it is the third extensor to this arti- culation ; but if singly in action it beads the hand laterally towards the ulna. The VI. anconeus—forms the sixth muscle superficially situated in this region; it has already been described together w'ith those whose function is to give motion to the elbow-joint. The progress of the dissection is best conducted by cut- ting through these six superficial muscles, and reflecting' them towards their origins and insertions, in order to expose the five deep-seated muscles of this region, allowing them still to remain attached, as it gives to the student an oppor- tunity to refer to their relative position. Of the five deep-seated muscles, one is belonging to the radio ulnar articulations, three are proper to the thumb, and one proper to the index finger. The m. supinator radii brevis—arises tendinous and fleshy from the back part of the external condyle of the humerus, and from a ridge on the outer side of the ulna, extending downwards from its lesser sigmoid cavity; from these origins the belly of the muscle w'inds around the superior radio ulnar articulation, being firmly attached, and indeed partly arising from its ligaments ; it then passes to the anterior and inner surface of the radius, to be inserted into the upper third of this bone, in a space between the insertions of the biceps above, and the pronator radii teres below. This muscle surrounds the superior radio ulnar articula- tion ; it is covered on its outer side by the supinator radii longus, and the extensores carpi radiales; behind, by the K

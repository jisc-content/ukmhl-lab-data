descriptive anatomy of articulations. 215 into the upper part of the posterior arch of the atlas. This ligament has in contact with its posterior surface, the straight and superior oblique muscles of the head, the vertebral arte- ries, and sub-occipital nerves. The capsular ligaments, which strengthen the articulation of the condyles of the occiput with the atlas, are attached to the circumference of the articular processes of both these bones ; they are looser anteriorly and posteriorly, than at the sides, and allow therefore but of httle lateral motion. The synovial membrane covers the occipital condyles and articular processes of the atlas, lining at the same time that part of the internal surface of the anterior and posterior cir- cular h'gaments, which is in contact with those portions of bone, and thus assists in forming the capsular ligaments, for the more perfect security of this articulation. The synovial membrane is also attached, on its inner side, to the transverse ligament of the atlas. Connexion of the Vertebra Dentata with the Occiput. These bones are not in actual contact so as to form a joint, but they are kept in their relative situation by the two lateral or alar ligaments, which arise connected with each other from the body and sides of the odontoid process, reaching as far as its apex; from which point they pass on either side up- wards and outwards, to be inserted between the inner edge of the condyloid processes and the foramen magnum of the occipital bone. They are for the purpose of preventing the head with the atlas being rotated too forcibly and extensively upon the vertebra dentata. Articulation of the Atlas with the Vertebra Dentata.

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 197 externus; internally it is bounded by the gracilis, and ex- ternally by the psoas and iliacus; its insertion is on a plane anterior to the pectineus, and adductor magnus. The m. adductor magnus—is by far the largest, and most posterior muscle of the three; it arises fleshy from the whole length of the descending ramus of the pubes, and ascending ramus of the ischium 5 also tendinous from the tuberosity of that bone: from these origins the fibres pass outwards aud downwards, with various degrees of obliquity, those from the pubes most transversely to be inserted into the wdiole length of the finea aspera; and at the junction of the middle wdth the lower third of the femur, it sends off a rounded tendon to be inserted into the internal condyle. The adductor magnus arises behind the other two ad- ductors ; its insertion is also behind these muscles, but an- terior to the glutaeus maximus and short head of the biceps, from w'hich it is separated by the attachment of the fascia lata to the linea aspera between them. It is covered ante- riorly by the gracilis, long and short adductors, pectinaeus, sartorius and femoral vessels; which latter, at the inferior fourth of the thigh, penetrate a foramen composed of fascia, common to this muscle and the vastus internus, to gain the popliteal region. The upper edge of this muscle, as it passes from the tuberosity of the ischium to the femur, runs parallel to and below the quadratus femoris; the three heads of the adductors are perforated by the muscular branches of the profunda artery. Use.—The triceps adductor femoris brings the one thigh forcibly towards the other, and tends to rotate it outwards ; the two shorter heads assist in flexing the femur upon the pelvis, but the adductor magnus opposes them in this action. The three origins of this muscle, and the pectinaeus, being now separated from the pelvis, we expose the attachment of the sixth rotator outwards of the thigh. The m. obturator externus—arises from that portion of the pubes and ischium which form the circumference of the obturator foramen, as well as from the obturator ligament;

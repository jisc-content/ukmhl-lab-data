PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 280 ,are called i\va inferior mterosseous ligament, which serves very considerably to protect the ancle-joint. The anterior__ surface of the interosseous lig'ament is covered by the flexor muscle of the foot, the extensors of the toes, and the an- terior tibial vessels and nerve ; its posterior face covers the extensor of the foot, and the flexors of the toes. At the upper part of this membrane there is an opening for the transmission of the anterior tibial vessels, and some of the fibres of the tibialis posticus muscle. Through the lower in- terosseal opening, which I have already described, there passes a branch of the peroneal artery. Inferior Fibulo Tibial Articulation. This articulation is formed by two triangular articular sur- faces ; that on the fibula being convex, and that on the tibia concave; both these surfaces are covered by cartilage: the synovial membrane of the ancle-joint lines their internal sur- faces, and the following ligaments strengthen their union. The anterior ligament is triangular, larger below than above, and it passes from the lower extremity of the fibula to the fore part of the tibia. Its anterior surface is covered by the tendon of the peroneus tertius muscle; it serves to strengthen the articulation of the astragalus with the tibia and fibula, by rendering the cavity deeper in the anterior part. The posterior ligament is composed of two fasciculi, sepa- rated from one another by an intervening space ; the inferior fibres are sometimes called the inferior posterior ligament. They both, however, arise from the back part of the malleolus externus, and pass inwards to be inserted into the back part of the tibia. The inferior fasciculus, or inferior posterior ligament, is longer than the superior, and crosses so behind the articular surface of the astragalus, as to prevent its luxation backwards. They together serve the same purpose as the anterior ligament, in rendering the articulation of the

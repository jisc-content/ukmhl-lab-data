I 298 GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. theorists who assert, the cuticle to he a mere secretion from the cutis. The cuticle, in some serpents, is separated from their bodies as often as once in two months; while in other animals, as in the Crustacea, and certain insects, it appears to occur but once in a year; during’ which time, the torpid state tends to diminish their respiratory function until the new cuticle is developed. The cuticle has a remarkable power of reproduction, as may be seen from the quick manner in which it is capable of furnishing- a new covering’ over denuded surfaces. Pressure has an effect in producing- the growth of cuticle, as is seen by its great thickness in the palms of the hands, and soles of the feet; but in certain instances, from mal- formation of the feet, pressure will be thrown in an undue proportion on certain parts; this occasions so great an in- crease of cuticle, as to amount to a disease on that part, and can only be relieved by the removal of the whole sur- face of the thickened cuticle, by repeated applications of blisters ; and when this has been accomplished, it is neces- sary to protect the denuded part from pressure, by mecha- nical means, for a considerable length of time, otherwise the superabundant and hardened cuticle will re-form with great rapidity. Corns are of a similar nature, and the tendency to their formation, and their growth, is in a like manner owing to pressure; the method used by Chiropodists to extirpate them is, first to soften the skin by immersion in warm water, then with a blunt knife to detach and raise the cuticle a little distance from the circumference of the corn ; w'hich oper- ation, being continued, the corn is gradually separated. A hardened prolongation of a substance of the nature of cuticle, will sometimes grow from the skin, and most fre- quently from the scalp; they have been termed horns, but appear to depend upon an accumulated secretion from the surface of an ulcerated sebaceous follicle, and not, as has

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 177 length of the rami of the pubes and ischia to be so firmly connected with the periosteum of those bones, as to prevent any fluid passing- downwards towards the thig-hs ; below^ the transversus perinsei muscle it dips backwards, to the tube- . rosities of the ischia, and becomes connected with the deep fascia of the perinseum ; so that they are blended with each other: but above, where it passes to the scrotum and ab- domen, it is so loosely connected with these parts, that if fluid be injected under the superficial fascia, it invariably makes its escape from the perinseum in those directions. This fascia may now be removed, by making- an incision in the direction of the raphe, and reflecting- it outwards precisely in the same manner as described for the removal of the skin; when there will be exposed the accelerator urinae in the mezian line, the erector penis laterally situated, on either side passing- in the long- axis of the perinaeum, and the transversus perinaei muscles passing from the tuberosi- ties of the ischia to the fore part of the anus, so as to divide the perinaeum into an anterior and posterior region ; and we shall find, that the anterior space contains the bulb of the urethra with its muscle, the erectors of the penis, and deeper seated the levator ani; while the posterior space contains the lower extremity of the rectum and its musclfes. The m. accelerator urince—is found in the mezian line of the anteriop space betw een the anus and membranous por- tion of the urethra, surrounding the bulb. It may be considered as a single muscle divided into symmetrical halves, although generally described as a pair of muscles. It arises from the deep fascia of the perinaeum, between the bulb of the urethra and the erector penis, posteriorly, being- connected w'ith the sphincter ani and transversi perinaei muscles; the muscle then proceeds forwards, covering- the corpus spongiosum, and in the middle line is furnished W'ith a raphe, so as to give the appearance of two muscles; laterally it is connected with the crura of the penis: it thus proceeds to the anterior part of the corpus spongiosum, where its fibres diverge (so as to leave an interval in ‘ N

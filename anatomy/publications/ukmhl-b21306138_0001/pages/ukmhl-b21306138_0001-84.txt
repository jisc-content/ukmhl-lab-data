At the sides of the sella tursica, running from behind to before, is found a groove for lodging the internal carotid artery, after it has emerged from the canal, and the cavernous sinus: this groove is continued upwards underneath the an- terior clinoid processes, and is sometimes converted into a complete foramen for the passage of the vessel. Extending laterally from the body of the bone, are the internal surfaces of the alse majores, hollowed out into numerous concavities to correspond to the convolutions of the brain, and grooved by the arteries of the dura mater: they project backwards in a triangular form to terminate in the spinous process of the bone, which has been described on the external surface, and which is admitted into the space between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone. The alse majores present upon their upper and anterior parts, a rough and some- w'hat triangular surface, for their attachment with the frontal and parietal bones: their outer semilunar serrated concavities, which receive the temporal bones, are as obvious upon this as the external surface of the bone. The last processes to be described are the alts minores, which arise broad from the anterior part of the body of the bone, and extending transversely outwards, terminate in slen- der pointed extremities, which are sometimes attached to the greater wings, and complete the foramina lacera orbitalia superiora: while, at other times, these two portions of bone are not connected, and the foramina are, in that case, com- pleted by the junction of the frontal bone with the sphenoid. These slender pointed portions of the alae minores are termed the transverse spinous processes: their posterior edge is smooth, and gives attachment to a process of the dura mater, which separates the anterior from the middle lobes of the brain: their anterior edge is rough, to be joined to the orbitar process of the frontal bone; and in the middle part, the alae minores are connected by a thin plate of bone, which, poste-

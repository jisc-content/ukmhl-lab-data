GENERAL ANATOMY OF THE SKIN. 283 in abundance, communicating- great sensibility, so as to pro- duce most painful sensations in cutting the cutis, or exposing it by abrasion of the cuticle. The distribution of the nerves in the cutis is of great importance in the animal economy, as forming the seat of the sense of touch; very little is known of the real nature of this function, beyond its connection with the vital prin- ciple. It has been stated by physiologists, that each of the papillae consists of a spongy elevation of the cutis, into which projects the soft and sentient extremity of a nerve enclosed in some erectile tissue; these, however, are only assertions, unsupported by any anatomical demonstration. Contact appears to be necessary to the production of the sense of touch, but to what extent the cuticle is connected with the sentient extremities of the papillae is unknown; and whether it admits of the papillae being projected through corresponding- openings, to form a contact to produce the sensation of touch, is also unknowQ. The ready manner in which the mind distinguishes the diflFerent forms and con- sistencies of bodies through the medium of the sense of touch, proves the efficiency of this apparatus of nervous distribution to be very different from the distribution of those nerves which only experience painful sensation from their contact with foreign bodies. In some animals, the surface of the cutis presents a curious structure of papillae, which coat it externally; they are of a whitish appearance, broad at their base, terminating in minute points, which appear to project into the substance of the cuticle, and would give one the idea, that if the sense of touch resides in these papillae, that a similar structure may exist in the human subject, although too minute to be demonstrated. This structure is beautifully seen in different preparations of the common integuments of the whale tribe, in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. The Rete Mucosum Is situated immediately on the surface of the cutis, be-

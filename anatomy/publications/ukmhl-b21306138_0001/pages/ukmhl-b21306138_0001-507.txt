DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 121 The Tti, pdltticiTts lonffus—civiscs from the fore part of the internal condyle of the humerus, laterally from the inter- muscular tendons, and in front from the fascia of the fore arm; it then forms a very short fleshy belly, which soon becomes tendinous, and passes downwards in the middle of the fore arm to be inserted into the annular ligament, or rather it may be said, to be attached partly to this ligament and partly passing over it, into the palm of the hand, forms the palmar facia, which terminates by four fasciculi at the digital extremities of the four metacarpal bones. This muscle is sometimes wanting either on both or only . one side; it is covered anteriorly by the common integu- ments and aponeurosis of the fore arm ; it covers the flexor sublimis above; but below, while passing to the annular ligament, it gets to the outer side of the tendons of the flexor sublimis, and has the median nerve immediately behind it. Use,—To fix the wrist-joint, to render tense the palmar fascia, and to protect the vessels and nerves situated in the palm of the hand. The m. jlexor digitorum sublimis vel perforatus.—Before this muscle can be dissected perfectly from its origins, the three last described muscles should he divided, and reflected towards their attachments, when the flexor sublimis muscle will be found to have four distinct origins from the bones of the upper extremity; first, from the internal condyle of the humerus, connected to the bone by tendon common to it and other muscles; secondly, from the root of the coronoid process of the ulna, immediately below the insertions of the brachialis internus muscle; thirdly, from the radius, just below the tubercle of that bone, and consequently close to the insertion of the biceps; fourthly and lastly, from the fore part of the radius, and middle third of its outer edge: from these different origins, the fibres unite to form one fleshy muscle, which soon sends off four tendons; two anterior of which are for the middle and ring fingers, and the two posterior for the index and little fingers : they pass underneath the annular ligament, between the fascia pal-' maris and tendons of the deep flexors of the fingers, till

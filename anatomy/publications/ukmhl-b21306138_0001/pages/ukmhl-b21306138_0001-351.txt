AimCULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. 289 from the inferior extremity of one bone to the other, precisely in the same manner t\s in the metacarpus. Articulation of the metatarsus and phalanges.—^I’he su- perior extremities of the phalanges are articulated with the heads of the metatarsus; and they are connected by liga- ments similar to those which form the junction between the phalanges and metacarpus. The articulation of the phalanges of the toes is so pre- cisely analogous to that of the fingers, as to render its further description quite useless. The motions between the bones of the tarsus are but very slight; there are, however, two very important joints, which cross the tarsus in a direct line ; the inner one is formed by the astragalus and navicular bones, and the outer one by the os calcis and the cuboid. Slight lateral motion is al- lowed betw'een these bones. Practical Remarks. Dislocation of the Bones of the Tarsus. Their motions beinij limited, and their bonds of union firm and strong, luxation is of rather rare occurrence, and can only be produced by great violence; under which circumstance, however, the astragalus may be separated from the.os calcis, and the os calcis and astragalus may he luxated from the cuboid and navicular bones. The internal cuneiform bone is also liable to dislocation. The other bones of the tarsus and metatarsus are too strongly con- nected to admit of separation, unless, indeed, it be attended with total destruction of the foot. The phalanges of the toes are so short, as to render their displace- ment an itnprobahlc accident; excepting that of the first bone of the great toe from the metatarsal bone, which not unfrequently occurs, but is easily reduced.

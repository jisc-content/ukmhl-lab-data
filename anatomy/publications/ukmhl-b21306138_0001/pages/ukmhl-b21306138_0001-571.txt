DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 185 An cnlarg'emcnt of tlie third lobe of the prostate seldom renders it necessary to puncture the bladder, although it frequently forms an obstinate obstruction to the introduction of a catheter; but which may be overcome by another step superadded to those recommended in the introduction of an instrument into the bladder under common circum- stances. After the instrument has passed between the lateral lobes of the prostate gland, its further entry is resisted by the morbid develop- ment of the central third lobe ; hence the necessity of the use of a longer and larger instrument; the depression of the handle of which, to a still further extent than before recommended, tilts the point over the new and obstructing growth. The more important operation for the removal of urinary calculi from the bladder, will be described with the anatomy of the pelvic viscera ; as a previous knowledge of the relative position of these organs is indispensable to a true understanding of the necessary steps in the per- formance of this operation.

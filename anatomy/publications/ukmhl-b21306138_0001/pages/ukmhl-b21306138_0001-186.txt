130 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. Its dorsal surface is roug-li, slightly hollowed, and gives attachment to ligaments. Use,—This bone differs from the rest of the digital row of the carpus, in forming part of a very moveable articulation, which allows the thumb toi turn in every direction upon it, while the others admit of but little motion of their respective metacarpal bones. Attachment of Muscles.—The flexor and extensor ossis metacarpi polllcis, flexor brevis abductor pollicis, and abductor indicis, arc con- nected with the trapezium. Os Trapezoides. This bone is somewhat of the same figure as that last described: it is situated immediately to the ulnar side of the os trapezium, and, like it, presents four articular, and two non-articular surfaces. Its superior articular surface is somewhat concave, and is connected with the scaphoid bone. Its inferior, or digital surface, is divided into two articular faces, by a central ridge, which is received into the superior carpal extremity of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger. The internal, or ulnar surface, presents a triangular arti- cular face, which is in contact with the os magnum. Its external, or radial surface, is connected with the trape- zium, and is less than that by which this bone forms a junction with the os magnum. Of the tw’^o non-articular surfaces, the dorsal is the larger, and has its long axis placed obliquely from before to behind, and is rough for the attachment of the dorsal ligaments of the hand. The smaller palmar surface is also rough for the attachment of ligaments: it is so deeply seated in the palm of the hand, as to be concealed by the os trapezium. Use.—This boue, besides assisting in the formation of the carpus, also supports the middle part of the metacarpal bone of the fore finger. Attachment of Muscles.—7'hc only muscle attached to the os trape- zoides, is part of the flexor brevis pollicis. Os Magnum. The os magnum is so named from its being the largest

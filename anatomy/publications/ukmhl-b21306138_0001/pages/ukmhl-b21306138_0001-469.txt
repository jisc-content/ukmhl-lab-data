1 DESCRIl’TIVK ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 83 between the os hyoides and lower jaw, which is necessary to enable them to open the mouth. Four pairs of these muscles are placed below the os hyoides, between that bone and the trunk; but the fifth pair belong- to the fourth class of the muscles on the anterior part of the neck, and are found placed between the styloid process of the temporal bone and os hyoides, for the pur- pose of preventing the os hyoides being tilted too much forwards by the action of the other muscles. To commence this dissection, the sterno cleido mastoideus I should be divided near its centre, and turned towards its attachments, when a narrow muscle will be seen passing vertically from the os hyoides to the sternum, called The m. sterno hyoideus.—It arises inferiorly, by three distinct origins, from the back part of the sternum, from the posteror sterno clavicular ligament, and from the cartilage of the first rib; it then descends as a narrow band of muscular fibre, with a slight obliquity upwards and inwards, con- ; verging towards its fellow to be inserted into the lower edge of the body of the os hyoides. This muscle is covered by the deep fascia of the neck, and at its origin by the sterno cleido mastoideus; it covers the sterno thyroid, the crico thryroid and thyro hyoid muscles ; and in passing in front of the larynx, a small bursa is usually found be- * neath it. Use.—To depress the os hyoides and larynx, and secondarily assists ,j in the depression of the lower jaw. 1 The m. sterno thyroideus.—This is brought into view by ; dividing the former muscle and reflecting it towards its attach- j ments ; it arises from the posterior and upper part of the ster- I num, rather to the inner side and with a broader origin than the j sterno hyoideus, and also from the cartilage of the first rib ; it then proceeds upwards to be inserted into an oblique line extending across the ala of the thyroid cartilage. This I muscle is covered at its origin by the sterno cleido masto- j ideus ; throughout its whole length it is behind the sterno • ■ hyoideus, but which does not entirely conceal it, in conse- I

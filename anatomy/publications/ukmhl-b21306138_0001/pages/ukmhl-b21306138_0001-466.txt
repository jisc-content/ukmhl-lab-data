80 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. clavicle ; one portion of the skin is to be reflected forwards, and the other backwards; and thus a condensed fibro- cellular tissue, which has received the name of the fascia superficialis, is exposed. This fascia is continuous above with the fascia which covers the parotid gland; inferiorly it extends upon the thorax, there being continuous with the superficial fascia of the chest and abdomen ; while on the neck it presents one continuous sub-cutaneous surface; but its muscular or deep surface sends olF processes which pass down between the muscles to join the fascia cervicalis profunda, and give a complete covering to many of them. At the anterior edge of the trapezius muscle, it becomes attenuated and sends off a layer which passes beneath the platysma myoides so as to inclose it. The situations in- which the superficial fascia is most firmly connected with the deep fascia, are above, between the angle of the jaw and styloid process of the temporal bone; and, below at the upper edge of the sternum, between the origins of, the sterno cleido raastoidei. The fascia superficialis is now to be dissected from the neck, to expose The musculus platysma myoides, which is a thin quadri- lateral muscular expansion, situated on the anterior and lateral parts of the neck; it arises inferiorly from the cellular membrane covering the m. pectoralis major and deltoides; its fibres are at its origin separated from each other, but they gradually approximate as they ascend ob- liquely upwards and inwards to the basis of the inferior maxillary bone, to which they are attached; and then passing over the inferior part of the cheek intermix with the muscles of the face, and more especially with the depress ores labii inferioris et anguli oris. It is inclosed within two layers of the superficial fascia, at the chin, being united with its fellow, but separated below, leaving a space where the fasciae unite with each other, forming a dense resisting membrane. The external jugular vein takes its course beneath the platysma myoides, passing to the lower and clavicular origin of the sterno cleido mastoideus, to terminate in the sub-

THE SKELETON IN GENERAL, 294 central portion of the nervous system ; the other is anterior and inferior, is called the thorax, and lodges the central organs of respiration and circulation. Other cavities are to be found in this part of the skeleton, principally formed by the bones of the face, and serve for the reception of the organs of the senses. The extremities are provided with many and various arti- culations, admitting of a great variety of motion; and are, indeed, in every way admirably adapted to the purposes for which they are designed. On examining the circumstances in which the superior and inferior extremities resemble each other, we find an increase in the number of bones towards their distal extremities, whilst their mobility diminishes; ex- cepting, however, the comparative greater degree of motion in the articulations of the phalanges of the fingers and toes, than is admitted between the bones of the carpus and tarsus. The upper and lower extremities further resemble each other, in the number of parts into which each may be divided, and in a corresponding form and number of their bones. Thus the most cursory observation must shew a considerable analogy between the scapula and the clavicle of the upper extremity, and the ossa innominata of the lower; the hu- merus corresponding very obviously to the femur, the radius and ulna to the tibia and fibula, and the hand to the foot: but yet there are many points of dissimilarity worthy atten- tion, as tending to render them subservient to the difference in the functions they have to perform. The upper extremities are principally intended for very extensive motion, having but a slight comparative degree of weight to support, when com- pared to the lower. We therefore find the former most per- fectly adapted to every variety and extent of motion, being but loosely connected Avith the trunk; while the latter are much more firmly articulated, and are in every way calcu- lated to sustain the superincumbent weight of the body. The relative, as well as the absolute dimensions of the skeleton, change much with the age of the individual. Thus, the proportion of the head to the rest of the trunk and the

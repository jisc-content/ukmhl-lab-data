bones of the trunk. 91 sacrum and os eoccygis form so perfect a continuation of the spine, that they are nearly as essential to that division ol the trunk as to the pelvis itself. I shall therefore first describe them. The Sacrum May be considered as the largest bone of the spine, the weight of which column it receives, and transmits to the ossa innominata, with which it is laterally connected. The form of the bone is triangular, presenting a base above, an apex below, an anterior and posterior surface, two lateral edges, and a canal for the spinal marrow. The base of the bone resembles very much, in its appearance, a lumbar ver- tebra, being furnished with a body for its articulation with the last bone of the spine. It has also two projecting lateral processes similar to the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and which, like them, give attachment to muscles and liga- ments, Its articulatory processes are directed backwards and inwards: they are concave, and are connected with the inferior articular processes of the last lumbar vertebra. The apex offers below a small roughened surface, by which it is joined to the coccyx; and on each side of this surface is seen a notch, which is completed into a foramen by the junction. The anterior surface of the bone is concave, smooth, and traversed by four lines, which mark the different pieces of which it was originally composed, and impart to it somewhat the appearance of anchylosed vertebrae. It presents four pairs of foramina, which communicate with the interior of the bone, and allow of the transmission of the anterior sacral nerv^es. The fifth pair of foramina are common to this bone and to the os coccygis. The posterior surface is convex and very unequal, pre- senting in the middle line four or five compressed projecting portions of bone, somewhat resembling diminutive spinous processes. These are united, and form one lengthened ver- tical spine. This spine, however, is not continued the whole

180 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. The synovial capsules of joints do not correspond in num- ber to the articulations, since it is found that one synovial capsule is frequently subservient to several of them. Synovia. The secretion which is produced by the synovial membrane, is so called from its resemblance to the white of an egg; it is poured out from the extremities of the vessels, which ter- minate upon the internal surface of the membrane ; and as this also possesses an absorbent power, the quantity of fluid under ordinary circumstances is limited to a healthy standard. When synovia is in a healthy state, it is transparent, of the consistence of albumen, very viscid, and upon being- ag-itated entang-les a considerable quantity of air; it is heavier than water, its specific gravity being 105. Its chemical analysis, according to Sir Humphry Davy, is as follows;—100 parts of synovia contain— 98 3 water. •93 gelatine and mucilage. •53 albumen. •23 muriate of soda. — traces of fixed alkali and phosphate of lime. 100 It has been a point of considerable dispute among physi- ologists, whether the synovial membranes should be ranked amongst the serous or mucous structures; and indeed this discrepency appears to depend on the membrane partaking in some respects of the nature of both these systems. It re- sembles the serous membranes, from its forming a closed cavity, from its presenting at once a secreting and absorbent surface, from its extensibility, and from the manner in which it attaches itself to the parts that it covers. It is analogous to the mucous membranes in the consistence of its secretion,

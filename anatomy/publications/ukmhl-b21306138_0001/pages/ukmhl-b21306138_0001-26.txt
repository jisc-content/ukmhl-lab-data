LECTURES ON ANATOMY. XX] 1 by the extent and position of one or more of the bones con- stituting- the skeleton. The human body, like that of all other organized bodies, is composed of liquids and solids, which are continually changing into one another. The fluids form much the g-reater proportion in regard to bulk ; it should however be observed, that their exact proportion to each other cannot well be ascertained, as sorhe of the fluids are with great difficulty separated from the solids. Some anatomists have, indeed, assumed the proportion between the liquids and solids to be as six to one ; and others, even as nine to one: but their proportion varies according to the individual, sex, age, and constitution. Having investigated and described the various parts that compose the human body, the formation of which, from their instrumentality, are denominated the organs, I shall now proceed to explain their uses and functions, thus developing that branch of the science which is termed physiology. The consideration of the structure and functions of the organs in their healthy state, will be naturally followed by that of the changes produced in them by disease or injury; and thus the department which is termed pathology, will be eluci- dated. To enumerate in detail the several parts of the human body, would on the present occasion be superfluous ; I shall, therefore, confine myself to such a general view of them, as may lead you to consider, how beautifully the machine is adapted to the purposes for which it is destined. The body, as has already been observed, consists of a duly proportioned aggregate of solids and fluids, subject to constant waste, which is repaired by the introsusception of certain extra- neous substances, collectively termed food. Man is enabled to obtain the fresh supply requisite for his subsistence, by the aid of the senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and feel- ing ; four of which are exercised by particular organs, while the nerves, ministering to that of feeling, are distributed

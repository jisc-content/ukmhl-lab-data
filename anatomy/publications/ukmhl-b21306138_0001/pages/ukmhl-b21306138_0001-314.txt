PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 252 in contact with the posterior ligament of the wrist-joint, and its anterior with the interosseous ligaments ; it also tends to strengthen this row of the carpus. Articulation of the Pisiform Bone. This bone being situated anteriorly to the other bones of the carpus, has a peculiar articulation with the cuneiform, which is furnished with a synovial membrane covering the articulatory surface of each bone; it has also an inferior liga- ment, which connects it with the hamillary process of the unciform bone, and is further strengthened and maintained in its situation by the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The Second or Digital Row of the Carpus. The bones of this row are connected by interosseous, pal- mar, and dorsal ligaments, precisely similar to the cubital row; the fibres of which pass from without to within, in a transverse direction, from the trapezium to the unciforme, and are attached to the intermediate bones. Articulation of the two Rows of the Carpets with each other. This articulation consists of three distinct joints, viz., the trapezium and trapezoides with the scaphoid; the unciform with the cuneiform ; and the os magnum with the lunar and scaphoid bones: the two first forming an arthrodial articu- lation, while the latter forms an enarthrodial joint. These joints are connected by external and internal lateral, anterior and posterior ligaments, and by synovial membrane. The lateral ligaments appear to be nothing more than a continuation of the external and internal lateral ligaments of the radio carpal articulation; being attached, as they descend

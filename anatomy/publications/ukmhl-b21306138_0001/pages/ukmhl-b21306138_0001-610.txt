224 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. position of the erect posture; particularly in walkingâ€™ and running, when the centre of gravity is alternately transferred from the foot which leaves, to that foot which meets the ground. The manner in which the pelvis is attached to the thigh- bones, is admirably contrived to facilitate those rapid changes. The pelvis, with the weight of the whole trunk which rests upon it, is immediately supported by the ilio femoral articu- lations, which are placed nearer to the pubes than to the sacrum; by which conformation, the length of the lever is favourable to those muscles which are attached to the pelvis for the support of the spinal column ; while, at the same time, the oblique direction of the neck of the femur, and the manner in which the head is received in the aceta- bulum, is calculated to support the vertical pressure of the pelvis, and to prevent the tendency of separation of the ilia from the wedge-like articulation of the sacrum. And further, the equilibrium of the pelvis is maintained by a large mass of muscles, which have their attachments to the pelvis, and the femora, both anteriorly and posteriorly. After these preliminary remarks, we may proceed to men- tion the motions of the hip-joint; which, like all other enar- throdial articulations, extend in almost every direction, but not to the same extent as those joints which have less weight to support. The direction of these motions has been classed into those of flexion, as when the thigh is directed forwards upon the pelvis; extension, when carried backwards; abduction, when the thighs are separated; adduction, when approx- imated ; rotation, when the knee is turned outwards or in- wards ; and circumduction, which is the quick succession of all these motions. Flexion of the hip-joint, is performed principally by the psoas magnus, iliacus, and pectineus, which, being the first muscles of the lower extremity put in action in progression, are termed the progressors; but flexion is further assisted hy other muscles of the hip-joint; namely, the adductor

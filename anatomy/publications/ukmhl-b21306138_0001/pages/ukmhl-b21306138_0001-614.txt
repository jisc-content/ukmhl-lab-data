DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 228 IS clothed. The toes have, similar to the fingers, their common and proper muscles. The common flexors to the toes, are the lumbricales, which are inserted into the first phalanx of the four lesser toes; the flexor brevis digitorum, into the second; and the flexor longus, into the third, or extreme phalanx: these muscles assist also in the extension of the ancle-joint. The common extensors, are the extensor longus, and brevis digitorum communis, which form a common aponeu- rotic expansion over the dorsal surface of the toes; assisted by the interossei. The two former muscles contribute also to the flexion of the ancle-joint. Abduction and adduction of the three middle toes, are performed by the interossei. The great toe has all its motions performed by muscles proper to it; namely, its two flexors, an extensor, an ab- ductor, and an adductor muscle. The little toe has two proper muscles, a flexor brevis, and an abductor. The os ealcis forming the principal fixed point of the bones of the foot, and several of the muscles of the toes taking their origin from it, they contribute in a great mea- sure to maintain the longitudinal arch of the foot; while at the same time their flexion and abduction of the great and little toes, contribute to the elasticity of the foot, and its adaptation to the various surfaces it is brought in contact with in progression. It is to be observed, also, that the motions of the different joints of the lower extremity are much combined with each other, and in their greatest exertions unite their forces; thus at the time the respective muscles are fixing the hip and knee for the support of the weight of the body, the muscles of the leg are acting for the same purpose upon the foot and ancle. This combination of action tends materially to lessen the force of pressure and concussion, which would otherwise be liable to produce the frequent rupture of tendon and muscle;

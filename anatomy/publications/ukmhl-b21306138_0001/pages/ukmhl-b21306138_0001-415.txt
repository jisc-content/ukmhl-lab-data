GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 29 the fire, and other common purposes in which we call the lever in aid; and yet, of the three kinds, this is the least frequently employed in the action of muscles. The second kind has the resistance in the centre, the power at one end, and the fulcrum at the other. The third kind is that in which the power is in the centre, the resistance or weight at one end, and the fulcrum at the other. These levers, and their'mode of action, may be more easily understood by the following diagram The third kind is the one most used during muscular action in the body, which, according to the laws of me- chanics, is the most disadvantageous; but the advantages which are gained by it will afterwards be mentioned in some of the rnotions of the muscles: however, all three of the levers are employed ; for instance, when the head is moved on the first cervical vertebra, the fulcrum is placed between the power and resistance, as in the first lever: when the weight of the body is raised by standing on tip-toes, then the resistance is placed between the fulcrum and the power: and, as the third, in raising a weight in the palm of the hand, by bending the elbow, the power 'is situated between the fulcrum and the resistance. This usual application of the lever, which occasions a necessary loss of power to the muscles, is not the only disadvantageous circumstance under which the muscles act, according to strictly mechanical principles; but there are other causes which should also be pointed out:— First.—That the efforts of some of the muscles are divided, partly by acting upon the bone from which they

PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, 226 the instance of every joint where there is an interarticular cartilage, into two synovial cavities; the upper one belonging to the articular surface of the clavicle, and the superior face of the interarticular cartilage ; the lower one being between the sternum and the cartilage. They are reflected over the internal surfaces of the anterior and posterior sterno-clavicular ligaments. They secrete but an inconsiderable quantity of synovia, and sometimes the two cavities are united by an opening through the cartilage. The upper synovial or clavicular capsule admits of motion upwards and downwards, while the lower or sternal capsule admits of backward and forward motion; and therefore we find in this, as in all other joints where there is an interarti- cular cartilage, that not only strength is added to the articu- lation, but that also its motions are rendered at least more varied, if not more extensive. Articulation of the Clavicle with the Scapula. This articulation is strengthened by the following liga- ments, which may be divided into those which attach the clavicle to the acromion, and those which connect it with the coracoid process of the scapula. This latter junction is pro- duced by ligament only, there being no bony continuity; while, in the former, the surfaces of bone are in juxtaposition, presenting superior and inferior surfaces, which give attach- ment to corresponding ligaments. ArticvXation of the Clavicle with the Acromion. Class Diarthrosis.â€”Subdivision Arthrodia. This articulation is strengthened by a superior and an in- ferior ligament, and is also furnished with a synovial capsule. The superior ligament is composed of very strong fasciculi, which pass from the upper surface of the clavicle to the

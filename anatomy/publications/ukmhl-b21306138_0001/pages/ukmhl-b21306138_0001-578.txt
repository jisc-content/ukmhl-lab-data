15^2 DE8CUIPTIVE ANATOMY OP MUSCLES. the inner side, covering' the orig-in of those muscles of the knee-joint which arise from that portion of bone, namely, the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps; and be- tween the trochanter and tuberosity it covers the ischiatic nerve and vessels, the quadratus femoris, and adductor mag'nus muscle. Use.—To extend the thigh by carrying it bacicwards, and slightly to rotate it outwards; the two act forcibly to maintain the equilibrium of the body in its erect and bent positions. On the raising of the glutseus maximus, which should be left attached by its tendinous insertion, you expose The m. glutceus medius—which arises from the outer edge of the anterior and superior spinous process of* the ilium, and from the dorsum of that bone between the crista and the semilunar ridge, marking the origin of the glutseus minimus, reaching as far back as the posterior and superior spine ; also from a rough ridge, extending between the two anterior spinous processes: from these several origins, the fibres converge, forming a thick triangular muscle, which passes to be inserted into the upper and outer part of the great trochanter. The posterior half of the glutseus medius is covered by the glutseus maximus; the anterior half by the fascia lata, from which some of its fibres are said to arise ; it covers the glutseus minimus, and the deep branches of the glutseal artery ; its inferior edge is running parallel with the pyriform muscle, crossing it at its point of insertion, where a bursa mucosa is placed. Use.—Principally to abduct the thigh; its posterior fibres tend to rotate the thigh outwards, and the anterior fibres to rotate the thigh forcibly inwards ; while the whole muscle maintains the equilibrium of the body in the erect position. This muscle should now be raised from its origin to ex- pose The m. glutceus minimus—which arises by short aponeu- roses from a semilunar line on the dorsum of the ilium, extending from the anterior and inferior spinous process

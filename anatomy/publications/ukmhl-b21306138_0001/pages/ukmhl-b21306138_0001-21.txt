It is not because man is erect in stature, and has two hands, that he is entitled to a separate and highly pre- eminent rank in the animal king’dom, but because he pos- sesses the great faculty of reason or judg'ment, which ena- bles him to distinguish what is advantag’eous or useful, from what is inconvenient or pernicious.

When this faculty is fully exerted, it raises man above the sphere of self-interest, and prompts him to aim at promoting- the g-eneral advantag-e of his species. If this, his hig-h prerogative, be duly considered, no argument will be required to shew that man is the master-work of the Crea- tor’s hand ; and that whatever is calculated to establish the health, augment the comfort, and improve the condition of a being so richly gifted and so highly favoured, cannot de- serve to be otherwise regarded than as one of the most interesting objects of human enquiry. Such, for inscrutable purposes, is the constitution of the physical and moral world, that human life is not only precarious as to its duration, but exposed at every hour to a variety of ills, demanding all the resources of human knowledge for their prevention or cure. Health is universally felt to be the greatest of all earthly blessings ; it is, in every condition and degree of society, the sweetener of existence; with it, the poor, through industry, attain to independence, to affluence; with it, the wealthy relish the advantages of riches ; without it, the peasant must •strug-gle against penury, and die a lingering and a cheerless

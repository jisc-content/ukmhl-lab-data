XXxii LECTURER ON ANATOMY, are adapted for the removal of the solids, which, however, must have previously underg-one solution. It is an ordinance of nature, that animals should have tlie power of propagating- their own species; and they are accordingly provided with generative organs, in the respec- tive formation of which consists the distinction of the sexes. Those organs, in either sex, are divided into external and internal: the external may be considered as destined for the purpose of procreation; the internal, in the male subject, include the apparatus requisite for producing impregnation, while those of the female are adapted for conception and gestation. Our attention must now be directed to the eehular mem- brane,â€”a soft, spongy tissue, extending through all the divisions of the body, surrounding all the organs, forming at once their medium of union and separation, penetrating into their substance to pervade in like manner their component parts, thus entering into the organic structure of all organized bodies, and constituting the principal element of organization. This substance may be regarded as consisting of true cellular membrane, and of adipose membrane; the former being universally diffused, while the latter is excluded from the eyelids, the scrotum, and every other part where the presence of fat would interrupt or impede an essential function. The whole exterior surface of the body w'^^e find to be covered with a strong elastic integument, called the skin : it is divided into two layers, of which the internal is called the true skin, and the external is termed the scarf skin, or epidermis. Anatomists have distinguished a third layer, which, from the characteristic colour, is quite apparent in negroes; and this they denominate the reie mucosum. It is the property of the skin, not only to afford protection to the organs beneath it, but to exercise functions peculiar to itself; namely, the exhalation of a gas, and the exsudation of perspirable matter, and of sebaceous s,ecretions, while it permits the excrescence of the hair. In this general view of the human frame, you may have observed that its component parts, which have hitherto en-

24 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. the variety of their form dependingâ€™ upon the organs to which they are attached, and their want of connection with tendons, are, as I have said, the principal distinguishing marks of the internal or involuntary muscles. The mixed class of muscles are those which, both in structure and function, are intermediate to the voluntary and involuntary ; their distinguishing characters I shall describe before those of the voluntary class, as the latter are more especially the object of consideration in viewing the mus- cular system. Tliis intermediate class of muscles are named the mixed, in consequence of the voluntary power we possess over them to modify their action ; although, at the same time, we cannot by any effect of the will entirely stop the performance of their function for any length of time. The diaphragm, and all the muscles of respiration, are included in this class, as we are enabled to use them quickly or slowly at will, although we cannot by the same effort cease to respire for any length of time ; habit, however, renders persons capable of ^suspending this action for a considerable period, as may be observed in divers. The sphincter muscles may be considered as belonging to this class, for they are not con- stantly under the dominion of the will. These muscles differ in structure from the involuntary, in having tendinous attachments, and also in being of a red colour; many, however, resemble them in having their inner surfaces covered by a membrane, and in partly re- ceiving their nerves from the sympathetic. The irritability of these muscles may be considered as somewhat greater than that of the voluntary, and less than that of involuntary muscles ; whilst their power of contrac- tion is also intermediate. The Voluntary Muscles. These muscles, which belong to the animal functions, are attached to the bones, and constitute the active power which put those levers in motion. These muscles are firm and

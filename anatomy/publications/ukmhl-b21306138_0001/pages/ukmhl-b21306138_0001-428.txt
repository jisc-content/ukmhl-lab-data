42 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. and profundus dig-itoruni, witli the lumbrlcales; and deeply seated, the interossei. On the back of the hand the muscles are less numerous and complicated; being' only the extensors common to the fingers, with the interossei. I have, in this introduction to the description of the mus- cles, mentioned those of the upper extremity merely to point out the difficulty of their classification and the mode I wish to adopt to facilitate their arrangement; and shall now pro- ceed, as is usual in ours, as in most schools, to the muscles of the abdomen. The Abdominal Muscles. The exterior muscles of the abdomen belong to that class denominated in the physiological classification, flat or broad muscles; being composed of parallel fibres terminating in thin expanded aponeurosis, and situated in those parts of the frame where a great extent of surface is required to afford muscular parietes to cavities, for sustaining and assisting the function of the important organs which they contain. They consist of five pairs: the obliqui, externi et interni, the transversales, the recti, and pyramidales. The obliqui transversales and recti, are named from the direction of their fibres ; while the pyramidales have derived their name from the;r form. Previous to the particular description of these muscles, it is necessary to make some observations on the method of exposing them in the course of their fibres, in order that the dissection may be clearly and dexterously performed. First, an incision should be made from the cartilago ensiformis to the symphisis pubis ; the second incision should divide the integuments in an oblique direction upwards and out- wards, beginning from the umbilicus, and extending over the ribs as high as the sixth ; and the third incision is then to be made downwards and outwards, from the umbilicus to the crista of the ileum. On raising the skin from the fibres of the muscle it is to be observed, that a condensed

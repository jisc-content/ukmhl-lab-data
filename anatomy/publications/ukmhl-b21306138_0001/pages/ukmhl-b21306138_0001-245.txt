LECTURE VI. PHYSIOLOGY OF LIGAMENT. In order to complete the description of the structures which enter into the composition of a joint, we have now to speak of lig-aments, which are strong- fibrous bands, passing- from one bone to another, and serving- to g-ive stability to the con- nexion of those parts which we have already established, as essential to the formation of an ai-ticulation. Lig-aments effect this object, either by the direct interposition of a carti- lage attaching the two bones to each other, or through the means of a synovial membrane uniting the articular cartilages, which respectively cover the extremity of each bone. Although the generic term ligament is generally used in the above acceptation, namely, that of a membranous band passing from one bone to another, or connecting different parts of the same bone, yet the term ligamentous tissue is applied also to other structures, which belong to the same system, though they differ in their use, serving the purpose sometimes of forming bands to tie down tendons, as they pass towards their insertions; at others, connecting muscle to bone, under the name of tendon, and again enveloping im- portant organs, as the kidney, &c. We shall confine our- selves at present to the first class, or ligaments connecting bones, as the others will be better understood when speaking of those structures with which they are invariably connected. The ligamentous tissue connecting bones is composed of firm inelastic fasciculi, of a silvery white colour, arranged in parallel lines, and strengthened by cross fibres, the whole being enveloped by a cellular tissue. Their texture is gene- rally loose and fibrous on their external surface, and acquiring

BONE3 OF THE EXTREMITIES. 135 is connected with the middle fingâ€™cr on its outer, and with the little finger on its inner side The body of this bone is nar- rower than any of tlie other metacarpal bones. Metacarpal Bone of the Little Finger. Its carpal articulatory surface, for its attachment to the unciform bone, is convex from before to behind, and concave from side to side: the radial aspect has an articulatory sur- face for the metacarpal bone of the ring finger, while its ulnar surface projects a little beyond the uncilorm bone, and is roughened for the insertion of the extensor carpi ulnaris, and origin of the abductor minimi digiti. The radial side of the head of this bone only presents a tubercle, for the attachment of the intermetacarpal hgament. The Fingers. The fingers, which are composed of fifteen small bones, termed the phalanges, comprehend the third division of the bones of the hand. Each finger is furnished with three of these bones, and in all, that phalanx nearest to the metacarpal bone is the largest, the inferior the smallest, while the middle are intermediate in size. All the phalanges have their superior or metacarpal ex- tremity larger than the inferior, excepting in the first phalanx of the thumb, in which the inferior offers greater dimensions than its superior extremity. Their dorsal surfaces are convex and their palmar concave. The Superior, or Metacarpal Phalanges. These five bones differ but little from each other, excepting in size and length. Their superior extremity, which is the largest, presents an oval articular surface, having its long axis from side to side, and being concave from behind to be- fore, to be articulated with the rounded extremity of die metacarpal bones. On each side of this articular surface, is

250 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. Ligamentum carpi annulare.—This ligament, which is extremely strong, passes anteriorly to the concave arch of the carpus, for the purpose of tying down the tendons of the flexor muscles of the fingers, and also assists in preventing displacement of the carpal bones under any violent appli- cation of force. It arises from the pisiform bone, and from the hook-like process of the unciform, passes transversely across the carpus, and is attached to the scaphoid and tra- pezium. Its posterior surface is in contact with the flexor tendons of the fingers, and the anterior is covered by the aponeurotic expansion of the palmaris longus, and by the muscular fibres of the palmaris brevis, by the ulna artery, and by the superficial volar branch from the radial. The ulna artery, however, as it runs over the ligament, is pro- tected by a process of it which passes from the pisiform bone, or rather from the insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris, outwards to the middle of the superior edge of the annular ligament, and thus forms a groove for its safe transmission. Ligamentum carpi annulare dorsale.—This ligament is situated on the posterior part of the wrist; performing the same office, in tying down the extensor tendons of the hand and fingers, which the preceding ligament performs for the flexors. It arises from the styloid process of the radius, passes in an oblique direction from without to within, to be attached to the styloid process of the ulna; and in its passage along the posterior surface of these bones, it is connected with the edges of the grooves, which allow the passage of the extensor tendons, and thus forms sheaths for their pro- tection and transmission. Its posterior surface is only covered by skin and cellular membrane ; while, anteriorly, it is in contact with the tendons, and a membrane which secretes a fluid to lubricate them, and consequently prevents friction on their various motions. Its inferior edge sends off’ an aponeu- rotic expansion, which passes over the back of the hand, and assists in maintaining the extensor tendons in their passage to the fingers.

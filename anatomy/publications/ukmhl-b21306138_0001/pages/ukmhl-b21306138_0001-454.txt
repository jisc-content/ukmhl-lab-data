LECTURE XIV. DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. The Muscles of the Exterior of the Cranium and the Face. Before I enter upon a minute description of these muscles, it is requisite to point out those circumstances in which, with respect to their functions, they differ from all the other muscles of the human body: namely, that during- their contraction, they draw the integuments by which they are covered in various directions, without producing any change of position in the osseous parts to which they are attached. There are thirteen pairs and a single muscle included in this classification ; of which the three sphincter muscles, denominated orhiculares, are the principal, being for the purpose of opening and closing the eyes and mouth; the rest being employed to moderate and assist them in their action. When the three orbicular muscles act, their edges are brought in contact; while, laterally, they are held from the centre by their attachments, and the moderating muscles, with their cutaneous coverings, are drawn towards the centre : when the orbicular muscles are opened by the con- traction of their moderators, the skin covering them is made to radiate, as from a centre towards the circumferei.ee of a circle. In the special description it appears consistent to commence with the principal muscles, the orbiculares, and then to proceed with the description of their respective moderators, or the muscles which are subservient to their actions.

descriptive anatomy of muscles. 201 length of the outer edg'e of tlie linea aspera, reaching' as far as the external condyle, and from the flattened outer surface of the femur; from these origins it forms a strong- fleshy belly, which is tendinous anteriorly above, and posteriorly below ; from which tendons its fibres also arise, and pass obliquely downwards and forwards to be inserted into the outer edg-e of the tendon of the rectus and corresponding- part of the patella, sending off an aponeurotic process, which passes over the outer side of the knee-joint to be inserted into the tibia. It is covered by the fascia lata, and partly by the rectus; it overlaps the outer edge of the cruraeus; its origin from the linea aspera is anterior to the insertion of the glutaeus maxirnus, and the origin of the short head of the biceps, being- separated from them by a process -of fascia lata. Use.—To extend the knee, and assist in the rotation of the limb outwards. The m. vastus internus—bee-ins to arise from the fore part of the os femoris, immediately below the trochanter minor; from the anterior edge of the whole length of the linea aspera, and from the inner surface of the femur; this muscle, like the preceding, is tendinous anteriorly above, and posteriorly below, where its fleshy fibres descend lower than those of the vastus externus, and pass obliquely down- -w-ards and forwards, to be inserted into the inner edge of the tendon of the rectus and side of the patella ; sending olf an aponeurosis, which covers the inner side of the knee- joint, and terminates in the fascia of the leg. At the root of the trochanter minor its origin is anterior to the insertion of the iliacus and psoas, along the linea aspera ; it is anterior to the pectinaeus, and triceps adductor fenaoris ; it partly overlaps the cruraeus, and is covered by the fascia lata, which separates it from the posterior mus- cles of the thigh; inferiorly, it is crossed by the sartorius. Use.—To extend the leg, and slightly rotate it inwards. The flexors of the knee-joint are, the .sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps, and poplitacus.

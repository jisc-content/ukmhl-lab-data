128 UESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. are connected with each other by cellular membrane, and together pass behind the ligamentum carpi dorsale through a groove common to them and the tendon of the extensor indicis. These tendons separate upon the dorsum of the carpus, and continue diverging to the articulation between the metacarpus and first phalanx, thence proceeding to be finally inserted into the extreme phalanx of each finger. While these tendons are situated on the matacarpus they are thin and broad, and connected with each other by small tendinous bands ; while on the dorsal region of the first phalanges the tendons are thicker and more contracted, receiving the tendinous insertions of the lumbricales and interossei, and forming with them a continuation of aponeu- rosis, which covers the whole length of the back of the fingers. The origin of the extensor digitorum communis is placed between the extensor carpi radialis brevior and extensor carpi ulnaris; as it proceeds down on the posterior surface of the arm it covers the supinator radii brevis, the extensores pollicis iet indicis, posterior surface of the carpus, meta- carpus, interossei dorsales, and the fingers. An interval is left on the outer side of the back of the arm, between this muscle and the extensor carpi radialis brevior, in which may be seen the extensores primi et secundi internodii pollicis. Use.—To extend all the fingers; and, in its fullest contraction, to ex- tend the hand upon the fore arm. The m. extensor carpi ulnaris—arises fleshy and ten- dinous from the upper and back part of the outer condyle, between the extensor digitorum communis and anconeus ; fleshy from the intermuscular tendon and fascia of the fore arm, and also from a considerable portion of the back part of the ulna: its fleshy belly terminates in a tendon which continues down on the back part of the ulna, then passes 'through a groove immediately on the outer side of the styloid process of that bone ; from thence, under the annular liga-

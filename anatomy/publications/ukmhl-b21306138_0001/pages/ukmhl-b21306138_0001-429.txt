descriptive anatomy of muscles. 43 cellular tissue is also raised with it, which is situated on the whole anterior surface of the abdomen, betw'een the skin and the muscles, being- sufficiently thick and demonstrable to derive the name of fascia superjicialis. This subcutaneous aponeurotic membrane covers the anterior and lateral parities of the abdomen ; it is dense and strong inferiorly, and is continued upon the thigh laterally; while in the middle inferior part of the abdomen it passes downwards, so as to give a covering to the organs of generation; passing over the external ring, and pro- ceeding from the scrotum in the male, and the labia pudendi of the female, it becomes the superficial fascia of the peri- neum; superiorly it passes upwards upon the thorax, and is continuous with the cellular membrane covering the pla- tisma myoides muscle; while, laterally, it becomes more and more attenuated, until it is lost in assuming the appearance of common cellular membrane. This fibro-cellular membrane is somewhat elastic, and strengthens the muscular parietes of the abdomen ; it becomes an object of interest in patho- logical as well as in anatomical considerations, as forming one of the coverings in herni®, being sometimes so thickened as to present a very dense and important structure. This fascia being cleanly dissected from the muscular and tendi- nous parietes of the abdomen, the external abdominal oblique muscles are seen forming the lateral regions; while a ten- dinous structure occupies the central and lower part of the abdomen, producing several white tendinous line®, rendered more opaque than at other parts by the junction of the tendinous insertion of the abdominal muscles. The linea alba is situated in the middle line, and extends from the sternum to the pubes; it is formed by the union and interlacement of the tendinous expansions of the musculi obliqui and transversales. In the centre of this line is situated the umbilicus, which is a cicatrix filling up an opening which, in the f®tus, gives passage to the parts producing the umbilical cord; the linea alba is broadest at this part, above it is thin and semi-transparent, below it is dense and opaque.

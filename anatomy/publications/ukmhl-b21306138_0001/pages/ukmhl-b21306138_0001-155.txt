LECTURE IV. THE BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. The extremities form the third division of the skeleton, and are composed of the upper and lotver extremities ; between which there is a considerable resemblance, as well in the number as in the relation of their several bones. The upper, ox,thoracic extremities, are situated at the su- perior and lateral parts of the chest, being- attached to the trunk by the articulation of the clavicle with the sternum; this articulation forming- the fulcrum for the motions of the whole extremity. Several bones enter into the composition of the upper extremities, and are divided into those of the shoulder, arm, fore arm, and hand. The Shoulder. There are two bones which constitute the shoulder;â€”the scapula, a flat bone, situated at the posterior and lateral part of the chest; and the clavicle, a small cylindrical bone, placed at the upper and anterior part, and extending- over the upper part of the first rib. This bone forms the line of sepa- ration between the neck and the chest: it is situated between the sternum and the scapula. On tracing- it from the former to the latter bone, it is found to take a course from within to without, and from below slightly upwards, its scapular being rather posterior to its sternal end. In shape it somewhat re- sembles an italic S, projecting from the sternum, and forming a concavity in passing backwards to the scapula.

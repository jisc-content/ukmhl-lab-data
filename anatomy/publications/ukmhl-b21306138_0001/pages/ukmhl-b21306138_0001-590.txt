descriptive anatomy of muscles. 204 and fore part of the tuberosity of the ischium ; the tendon becomes broader as it descends, before the fleshy fibres commence, then forms a thick belly, which passes with very slig-ht obliquity downwards, and terminates in another flat tendon, which is directed vertically to be iTiserted into the upper, inner, and back of the head of the tibia; the outer edge of this tendon sends off an aponeurotic expansion, which passing anterior to the inner head of the gastrocnemius, assists in forming the posterior ligament of Winslow, which is affixed to the external condyle of the femur. This muscle lies between the biceps on its outer side, and the semitendinosus on its inner; it is bounded, anteriorly, by the adductor magnus, and posteriorly, it is covered by the fascia lata; it forms the inner boundary of the popliteal space. Use.—To flex the leg; and it also, from its connection with the semi- lunar cartilages, through the medium of the posterior ligament of Winslow, performs the important office of fixing them in their relative situation during the motions of the knee-joint. The m. biceps jlexor cruris—arises by a long and a short head: the long head, by a tendon from the upper and outer part of the tuberosity of the ischium, in common with the semitendinosus; it proceeds downwards and outwards, di- verging- from the semitendinosus, forms a thick fleshy belly which, below the middle of the thigh, unites with the short head: the short head arises by aponeurotic fibres from the linea aspera, immediately below the insertion of the glutseus maximus to within two inches of the outer condyle ; here the fibres of the two heads unite at an acute angle, and terminate in a strong tendon, which passes behind the ex- ternal condyle; and then, being directed forwards, and outwards, is inserted into the upper, outer, and back part of the head of the fibula, sending off an aponeurosis to be connected with the posterior ligament of the knee-joint. The origin of the long head is covered by the glutseus maximus, is connected with the semitendinosus, and covers the origin of the semimembranosus ; in passing downwards

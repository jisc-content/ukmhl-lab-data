PLATE II. Fig. 1. External view of a portion of cuticle from the palm of the hand, shewing the manner in which the papillae, or rugae, are arranged parallel to each other. 2. Surface of the cuticle from the back of the hand, magnified in the proportion of one inch to one eighth of an inch. 3. External view of the cuticle from the side of one of the fingers, shewing the manner in which the arrangement in Fig. 1 and 2 blend into each other. 4. External view of the cuticle from the tip of one of the fingers, shewing minute papillae between the parallel distributions. 5. Similar view to Fig. 2, magnified with a higher power ; the arrangement of the papillae in this view, is very similar to the structure of the under surface of leaves. 6. Internal surface of the cuticle from the palm of the hand, shewing the openings made through it by the perspiratory pores. 7. View of the external surface of the cutis—magnified as in Fig. 2. 8. The venous distribution of the external surface of the rete mucosum, from a preparation in the Museum at Guy's Hospital—magnified in the same proportion as Fig. 2. 9. The arterial distribution, from a finely injected preparation by Sir Astley Cooper, in the Museum at Guy’s Hospital. This arrangement of vessels appears to be underneath the net-work of veins represented in Fig. 8. 10. Surface of the cutis, and the groove which receives the attachment of the nail. 11. The corresponding internal surface of the nail, with the cuticle attached. 12. External view of the nail. 13. Enlarged view of the foetal nail. 14. Natural size of the foetal nail. 15. A section to shew the manner in which the cuticle is attached to the nail and cutis, and the commencement of the nail by a thin portion in the groove formed for its reception in the cutis. a. Cuticle, forming a duplicature at the root of the nail. b. The same in its free continuity. c. Cutis. d. Nail. e. p. Cuticle.

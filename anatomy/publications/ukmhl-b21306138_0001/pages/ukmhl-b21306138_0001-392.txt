GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 0 tissue. Their use to the muscular fibre is, to concentrate tlie force of its contractile power, and to diminish the surface for their insertion into bone, which must necessarily have been much more extensive had the fleshy fibres themselves been connected to the osseous system; and they further reg'ulate and modify the force and direction of their action. These tendinous fibres are not always for the purpose of forming- the points of attachment of muscles; they are sometimes found in the very substance of the muscles; in fact, they are subject to many varieties of situation in the muscular system, which will be pointed out when describing- in detail the classification of the muscles. The streng-th of the tendons seems to de- pend rather upon the peculiar conformation of its tissue than upon any vital principle, which is evinced by its retaining- all its physical powers even after death Blood-vessels are found in g-reat abundance in all the muscles, but not in all alike, as will be hereafter more parti- cularly mentioned. The arteries are sufficiently larg-e to be dernonstrated, so that their course may be traced; and their larg-er trunks are found entering- towards the centre of a muscle, where they immediately divide into smaller ramifications, which are equally destined to supply the true fleshy fibre, the tendinous and the investing- cellular membrane. Those which supply the fleshy fibres convey the red particles of the blood; from which circumstance, as well as from their size, they may be observed to divide into two sets of ramifications; one distributed to the superficial, while the other, including- the g-reater number, supplies the deeper fibres; and it is supposed that the ultimate ramifications of these vessels are as numerous as the ultimate fibres which constitute the muscle. The arteries of this sys- tem increase in size in proportion to the deg-ree of action to which the muscle is exposed, and are also materially in- fluenced in this respect by the health and ag-e of the subject; hence the redness of the wings of birds of flight, and the comparative whiteness of the muscles of their legs, which proves that the redness of the muscular system is derived, in

DESCRIl>TIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 181 situation, from a permanent extravasation of urine, and even sometimes passage of the faeces tlirough the part. The anatomy of these parts will now lead us to the consideration of the more important operations for relief of those diseases to which the urinary and genital organs of the male are liable. One of the most common of these operations to which a surgeon is called is, the introduction of an instrument for the dilatation of some contracted portion of the urinary canal; the mechanical aid employed may be either the soft and flexible waxen boujie, or a metallic instru- ment ; but, whether the one or the other be employed, the surgeon’s object should be to direct it in the natural course of the passage, which, under common circumstances, is readily performed. But should there from, disease of the canal itself, or mechanical pressure from either abscess or any other morbid cause, be a difficulty in the passage of the instrument; the surgeon will, with patience and gentleness, prosecute the operation in the following manner,—The patient should be placed in the horizontal posture, with the knees bent, and the thighs separated; the point of the catheter is to be introduced into the urethra, the handle of the instrument being parallel with the horizontal position of the body ; the handle should now be raised, and will be carried, unless there be obstruction in this portion of the urethra, readily to a right angle with the trunk—thereby arriving at the membranous portion of the canal: here very frequently an obstruction occurs, not however from any morbid cause, but from the manner in which the urethra is embraced by the deep fascia of the perinseum; an obstacle usually at once overcome, by drawing the penis forwards ; thus straightening the canal, at the same time depressing the handle of the instrument; which forms the third step, and completes the operation by conveying the instrument into the bladder. The wished for end is not always thus easily gained, from a morbid condition of the urethra, produced by permanent or spasmodic stric- ture ; rupture of the urethra, with false passage (frequently the result of violent and hasty surgery) ; and enlargement of the prostate gland. As it is not however my province, from the nature of this work, to enter minutely into details, I will only, in generalising on this subject, deprecate in the strongest manner the determination too frequently formed oiforcing an entry into the bladder. In cases of retention of urine, where immediate relief is necessary, and after bleeding, purging, and warm-bath have been employed in vain, it is then for the surgeon’s consideration, depending always upon the nature of the obstruction in the individual case, whether he should rely upon the possibility of a safe introduction of his catheter, or upon tlie more hazardous operc\tion of opening the bladder.

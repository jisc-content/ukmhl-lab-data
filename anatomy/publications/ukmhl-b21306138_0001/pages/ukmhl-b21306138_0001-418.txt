32 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. advantageous circumstances in reference to the attachments of muscles, as already described, they cannot exhibit any thing like that povrer in raising a w^eight. The velocity of muscular contraction is equally wonderful: the rapidity of speech, the quickness of motion of the fingers, are all illus- trations of the extent of this power. On Tendons. In the general description of the muscular system, the tendinous attachment of the muscles have been mentioned as answering the purpose of cords to transmit the force of the musclesâ€”the active organs of motion to the moveable bones; and this important function imposes the necessity of considering their structure, and of pointing out their peculiar properties. Tendons belong to the fibrous tissue which presents itself in the human organismus under this form, as well as that of ligaments, both being of the same tissue, and only so far differing in use, that the ligaments connect bone with bone, while tendons attach muscles to bone. The tendons are commonly found to be situated at both extremities of a muscle; not that they really commence from these extremities; for, by close examination, they maybe traced to a condensation'of the cellular membrane of the muscle to which they belong, proceeding from the internal cellular covering of all the fibres, as well as from the general investing aponeurosis; and then, forming a thickened rounded cord, passes to be inserted into bone, and, in most cases, by expanding and losing itself in the periosteum. The proportion between the muscles and their tendons is variable ; but usually they are thinner than the muscles to which they are connected. The tendons are not always found at the extremities of a muscle, but sometimes in its centre, producing a digastric muscle; and in other instances there are several tendinous intersections, as in some of the muscles of the abdomen: thus dividing the muscles into several parts, and furnishing so many fixed points, towards which the muscular fibres contract and are

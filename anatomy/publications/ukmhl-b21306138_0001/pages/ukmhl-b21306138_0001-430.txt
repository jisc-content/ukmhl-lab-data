44 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. On either side of the linea alba, and from three to four inches distant from it, is a crescentic white line, liaving its convexity turned outwards ; it reaches from the junction of the cartilag’e of the eighth with the seventh rib to the upper part of the pubes, opposite to the spinous process of that bone, and is termed the linea semilunaris. This line is formed by the junction of the tendons of all the flat muscles of the abdomen; and, indeed, is the point where these muscles become tendinous. There are also lineae to be observed which pass transversely from the linea alba to the lineae semilunares, which are termed the lineoe transversales, and usually, though not always, are found in the following- situations : the first one is generally opposite the cartilage of the last true rib; another midway between this and the umbilicus ; a third opposite to the umbilicus ; and, lastly, midway between the umbilicus and the pubes a fourth is found, but this usually is but half the length of the others. This tendinous expansion forms a complete aponeurotic boundary to the lower part of the abdomen, reaching across from the one anterior superior spinous process of the ileum to the other, and connected with the pubes in the middle line in such a manner as to produce a free edge on each side of the pubes, which is termed Poupart’s ligament; and which will be better understood when the origin and inser- tion of the external abdominal oblique muscle has been described. The musculus abdominis obliquus externus descendens is situated throughout its extent immediately behind the fascia superficialis, and forms the first muscular layer of the anterior and lateral boundaries of the abdomen: it is fleshy supe- riorly, posteriorly and laterally: and tendinous at its lower and anterior surface. This muscle arises from the eight inferior ribs, close to their cartilages; on the fifth and sixth ribs it is, by tendon and muscular fibre, connected with the pectoralis major; on the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, it digitates with the serratus magnus mus- cle ; and on the eleventh and twelfth ribs it connects itself

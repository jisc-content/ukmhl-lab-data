DESCRIPTIVE ANAT'OMY OF MUSCLES. 218 The m. accessorius ad jlexores digitorum pedis.—This muscle arises fleshy from the sinuosity on the inner surface of the os calcis, and tendinous from the under part of the bone below the sinuosity; its fleshy fibres pass forwards, assuming- a flattened square form ; after which it converg-es, and terminates by being- inserted into the outer part of the tendon of the flexor long-us dig-itorum, just before that tendon divides. This muscle arises from bone, and is inserted into tendon ; its upper surface is covered by the os calcis, tarsal liga- ments, and the origin of the abductor minimi digiti; its inferior surface covers the adductor pollicis, flexor brevis digitorum, abductor minimi digiti, and plantar vessels and nerves. Use.—To assist the flexor longus digitorum in its action. The m. lumhricales pedis—arises by four aponeurotic and fleshy origins from the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, immediately after their division, and pass forward parallel to the inner edge of the long flexor tendons, to be inserted into the inner and under surface of the first pha- lanx of the four lesser toes, and into the tendinous expansion from the tendon of the common extensors, on their dorsal surface. The lumbricales rest upon the flexor brevis digitorum ; their upper surfaces are covered by the transversus pedis, and adductor pollicis. Use.—To flex the first phalanx of the four lesser toes, and to adduct them, hut to extend the second and third phalanges. These muscles should be cut through, and reflected to- wards their attachments, to expose the third layer, which consists of the flexor pollicis brevis, adductor pollicis, transversus pedis, and flexor minimi digiti. The m. flexor brevis pollicis—arises by a strong- tendon from the lower and anterior part of the os calcis, also from the cuboid and under surface of the external cuboid bone. It soon forms a fleshy belly, which is directed forwards and

149 BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. Tlie afex is pointed, and gives attachment to the liga- rnentum patellae. Use.â€”The patella serves to protect the knee from injury, and also gives attachment to the e.xtensor muscles of the leg. The Fibula Is situated on the outer side of the leg, is of the same length as the tibia, but is much more slender : it is so situated, with respect to the tibia, as to be placed behind its level. This bone is divided into its body and two extremities. Its upper extremity, or head, is of an irregular form, but somewhat rounded, and presents an articular surface, which is concave from behind to before, faces upwards, inwards, and forwards, to be articulated with the external tuberosity of the tibia. Immediately posterior to this surface, a process of bone rises up of a pyramidal form, which serves to strengthen and protect the superior tibio-fibular articulation. The circumference of the head of the fibula is rough, for the attachment of ligaments, and also for the tendon of the biceps flexor cruris muscle. The body is twisted and irregular in form, but is somewhat triangular; and is bent with a slight curve outwards. Like the tibia, the body of this bone may be described as pos- sessing three faces and three angles: the faces distinguished as an external, an internal, and a posterior; and into an external, internal, and anterior angle. The external face is twisted, so as above to be directed forwards, and below backwards: it is somewhat hollowed in its upper third, where it gives attachment to the two peronei muscles. The internal face is also twisted, but in a contrary direction to the last; so that above it is directed backwards, and below forwards: the centre of this face is hollowed out, to lodge the muscles situated between the tibia and fibula in front. It also gives attachment to the extensor longus digitorum, and the extensor proprius pollicis. L 2

76 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. numerous muscles. The articulatory processes are four in number ; two being' situated above, and two below the trans- verse processes: the upper have a direction more or less backwards, and the lower ones forwards ; thus forming a junction with the corresponding processes of the vertebrae above and below. The surfaces which come in contact with each other are covered with cartilage. From the centre of the arch, posteriorly, projects the spinous process, passing backwards and downwards with various degrees of obliquity. This process is of the same compact texture as the whole of the arch, and gives attachment to muscles. The two pairs of notches are situated above and below, between the body and articulatory processes. The inferior are the deeper of the two ; and, by the junction of the vertebrae, they are formed into foramina, for the transmission of nerves from the spinal marrow. These are characteristics common to all the verte- brae: but, as they vary according to their situation and mobility, the column is divided into three distinct regions, viz.:—the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. The Cervical Region, Which is composed of seven vertebrae, is placed between the chest and the head. The vertebrae of this region may be known by the following distinguishing marks:—The body bears a comparatively smaller proportion to the whole bone than in the other regions ; it has its long axis extending late- rally, it is hollowed above, from side to side, whilst below, it is hollowed from before to behind: the fore part of the body is flattened, to enlarge the surface of contact with the pharynx and oesophagus. The processes which form the arch are broad and large, extending so far backwards from the body as to render the spinal hole large and triangular. The transverse pro- cesses are short, and extend directly outwards: their ex- tremities are bifid, and they are pierced at their roots by the vertebral foramina, which give transmission to the vertebral

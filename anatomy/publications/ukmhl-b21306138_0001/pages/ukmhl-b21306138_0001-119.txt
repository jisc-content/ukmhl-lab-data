LECTURE Ilf. THE BONES OF THE TRUNK. This forms the second division of the skeleton, and is subdi- vided into the bones of the spine, the thorax, and the pelvis. First Division of the Trunk. The Spine. The spine is composed of twenty-four separate bones termed the vertebrae, which are comprised under that class named the irreg-ular bones. In conjunction they form a pyramidal pillar, its base resting- on the pelvis, and supporting- the head by its apex. It forms a canal along- its whole leng-th, to contain the spinal chord. Each vertebra is characterized by its body, bony arch, seven processes, two pair of notches, and a hole for the spinal mar- row. The body constitutes the principal part of the bone, and is situated anteriorly; its circumference is more or less rounded, having- a shg-ht concavity behind, to assist in forming- the spinal canal: it is flattened above and below, for its connexion with the intervertebral substance. The texture of this portion of the bone is spongy. The arch is formed by two small processes of bone, passing- backwards and inwards, and meeting- in the median line ; thus completing- the hole for the spinal marrow. Of the seven processes, the first to be ob- served are the two transverse, which proceed from the arch, close to its junction with the body of the bone: they extend backwards and outwards with more or less obliquity, are of a compact structure, and arc marked by the attachments of

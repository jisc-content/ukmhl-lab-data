98 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. the eustaehian tubes ; then into the mouth, through the me- dium of the fauces; lower down into the larynx, through the glottis ; and, lastly, to its termination, where it is successively bounded by the os hyoides, thyroid, and cricoid cartilages of the larynx: but each of the openings, as has been before mentioned, are capable of being closed or opened by the action of the muscles of the fauces. Laterally the pharynx is bounded by tbe petrous portions of the temporal bones, the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid, the two jaws be- hind their molar teeth, the tongue, the cornua of the os hy- oides, and lastly, the lateral parts of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. Besides this muscular posterior parietes to the pharynx, there are two small muscles laterally placed, which pass from the styloid processes of the temporal bones, and which serve to keep the pharynx, during deglutition, in the best position to receive the food from the fauces. Having taken this general view of the pharynx, the muscles should now be dissected, by cutting through the trachaea, and turning the larynx and pharynx upwards ; orthey may be still better displayed, by removing the head from the body : in either case, they must be dissected from behind, and con- sequently it is the lower portion of the muscle, which has already been described as most posterior, which first comes into view; this is termed The m. constrictor pharyngis mferior,â€”^This is the longest of the muscles of the pharynx; it is broad, and irregularly quadrilateral ^ arises from the sides of the cricoid cartilage, near the crico thyroideus muscle, from the alee of the thyroid cartilage, immediately behind the thyro hyoideus muscle: from these origins its fibres pass upwards and backwards to be inserted into the mesian line, by uniting with its fellow, . and forming a rapha ; its superior fibres are long, and pass nearly vertically, so as to form a very acute angle with those of the opposite side; the inferior are short, and run transversely along the posterior part of the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage, to be connected with the upper part of the oesophagus.

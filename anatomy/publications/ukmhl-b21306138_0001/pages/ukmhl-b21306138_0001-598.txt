212 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, it the tibia, head of the fibula, and interosseous ligament; it has on its outer side, above, the extensor digitorum, and below, the extensor longus pollicis,—;a space being left be- tween it and these muscles, in which the anterior tibial vessels and nerves pass. Between the tendon of the tibialis anticus and internal cuneiform bone, a small bursa is si- tuated. Use.—To flex the ancle-joint, and direct the foot inwards. The m. extensor longus digitorum'pedis—arises tendinous and fleshy from the outer surface of the head of the tibia, from the inner side of the head of the fibula, and from about three fourths of its anterior angle ; in part also from the inter- osseous ligament, and fascia of the leg.' Its fibres pass with more or less obliquity inwards, and in the lower third of the leg terminate in a tendon, which commences in the substance of the muscle; this tendon, before it passes under the an- nular ligament, splits into three; and as they gain the dorsum of the foot, the inner tendon bifurcates: the four tendons then diverg’e, and pass to be inserted into all the phalanges of the four lesser toes, covering their dorsal surface as an expanded aponeurosis. There is a slip of muscle arising from the fibula in common with the extensor longus digitorum, which is by some anatomists described as a separate muscle, under the name of The m. peroneus tertius:—which arises g-enerally insepa- rably with the extensor digitorum communis, from the lower third of the fore part of the fibula and interosseous ligament; from thence it descends with the last described muscle under the annular ligament; inclosed in the same groove, and gaining the dorsum of the foot, diverges from it to be in- serted into the base of the metatarsal bone supporting the little toe. This muscle (or the two, if considered separately) is su- perficial, covered by the fascia of the leg. At the upper part of the leg, it is placed between the tibialis anticus, and peroneus longus, being firmly connected with them by

PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 206 The stylo-maxillary, or suspensory ligament. This liga- ment arises from the styloid process of the temporal bone, passes downwards and a little forwards, and is inserted by rather an extended surface into the angle of the lower jaw, between the fibres of the rnasseter and ptcrygoideus internus muscles. This ligament seems to be of as much importance in affording a surface for the attachment of the stylo-glossus muscle, as in connecting the temporal bone with the lower jaw. The synovial membrane gives an internal covering to the two lateral ligaments which I have described, and is also re- flected over the cartilaginous surface of the glenoid cavity in the temporal bone, and the condyloid process of the lower jaw. But by the intervention of the interarticular cartilage, this membrane is divided into two distinct synovial cavities: the upper compartment, which is the larger, is situated be- tween the glenoid cavity and the superior surface of the in- terarticular cartilage; and the lower one is placed between the inferior surface of the cartilage and the condyloid process of the jaw. The synovial membrane is strengthened laterally by the lateral ligaments of this joint; anteriorly, by the ten- don of the ptcrygoideus externus; and posteriorly, by the condensed cellular membrane covering the parotid gland; it is looser posteriorly than in the anterior part. Motions of the Lower Jaw. Man being an omnivorous animal, we find that the lower jaw is moveable in various directions, as the different sub- stances on which he feeds require different actions of that part for their complete mastication. It admits of motion- downwards, upwards, forwards and backwards, and has also lateral motion. When the lower jaw is depressed and the mouth opened, we find the condyloid process changing its situation in the glenoid cavity; so that its upper surface is turned forwards

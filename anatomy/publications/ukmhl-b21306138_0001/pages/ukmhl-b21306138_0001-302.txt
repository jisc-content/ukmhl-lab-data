240 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, Internal lateral ligament.—This lig’ament Is of the same shape as the preceding-, being- triang-ular; but is more dis- tinctly marked by the direction of its fibres, which pass ante- riorly and posteriorly. It arises from the internal condyle ; the anterior fibres, passing- from it to the coronoid process of the ulna, are covered by the flexors of the wrist and fing^ers, and are in contact with the synovial membrane ; its posterior fibres have the same origin, diverge from the former, and pass backwards to be inserted into the inner side of the olec- ranon ; they also give attachment to the synovial membrane, and protection to the ulnar nerve. The insertions of this ligament are connected by some ligamentous fibres which are attached to the olecranon and coronoid process, and, by some anatomists, have been described as a separate liga- ment. Synovial membrane.—To obtain an accurate knowledge of this membrane, the tendinous expansion of the muscles, with the ligaments connecting the joint, and the subjacent fat, must be removed; we shall then find that it takes its origin from the anterior concave surface of the olecranon, passes down to line the whole of the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna, prolongs itself between the radius and ulna, covering the lesser sigmoid cavity, reaches as far as the neck of the radius, where it becomes reflected, forming a cul de sac, and here lines the inner surfaces of the coronary ligament; it then extends itself upon the posterior surface of the anterior ligament of the elbow-joint, passes over the two condyles of the os humeri, covers the anterior surface of the posterior ligament, and terminates at the point from which we began the description. Motions of the Elbow-Joint. Flexion and extension are the only motions of which the elbow-joint is capable. During flexion, the radius and the ulna slide from behind to before on the condyles of the

LECTURE XVI. DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Muscles of the Back. Having described the muscles of the upper extremity, and in the progâ€™ress of the dissection necessarily removed part of the muscles of the back, I shall now proceed to the remaining- muscles of that reg-ion. The subject being- placed upon the abdomen, and the chest raised by blocks, the common integuments of the back should be dissected off, when a considerable layer of fascia will be exposed, giving more or less of a general covering to the subjacent muscles, and extending from the occiput to the pelvis. This aponeurotic expansion derives different names from the parts to which it is attached; hence it is termed the ligamentum nuchse above, dorsal fascia in the middle, and lumbar fascia below; each of these parts re- quiring a separate description. The ligamentum nuchae, proceeds from the occiput to the sixth cervical vertebra ; above it dips deeply down between the muscles, and separates those of the one side from the other ; it seems to be formed of the aponeurotic origin of the muscles of this region, and assists in keeping the head erect, diminishing thereby the necessity of so great and constant a muscular action for that purpose. In quad- rupeds it is much stronger and more distinct than in the human subject. From the termination of the ligamentum nuchse, a broad aponeurosis expands laterally to the scapulae, underneath the trapezii muscles, strengthening their fibres and binding down the muscles underneath ; it reaches from the sixth cervical, to the fifth or'sixth dorsal vertebra, dividing

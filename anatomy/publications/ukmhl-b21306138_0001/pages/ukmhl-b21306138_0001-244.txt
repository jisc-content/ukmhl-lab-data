PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 182 Mr. Brodie, do sometimes form such adhesions with each other as in a great measure to destroy the motion of the joint, and to produce an am- phiartlirodial articulation. Loose cartilaginous bodies sometimes form in the synovial cavities, more particularly in the knee-joint; they are generally loose within the sac, although occasionally they are fixed. No one has been able to give a satisfactory account of their formation, but it seems probable that they are originally attached to the synovial membrane by peduncles, which are accidentally torn through ; they fall into the cavity of the sac, and then are capable of being moved into different positions. When in this state they may be removed.

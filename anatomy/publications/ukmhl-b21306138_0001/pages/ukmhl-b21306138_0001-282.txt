220 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. surrounds the anterior part of the head of the rib, and then, in all excepting- the first, eleventh, and twelfth, divides itself into three orders of fasciculi; one passing- upward to the arti- culation of the rib with the vertebra above, another passing to the vertebra below, and the third and central fasciculus attaching the rib to the intervertebral substance : thus every rib is firmly attached to two of the vertebrae, and to the intervertebral substance. The anterior face of this ligament is covered by the thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic nerve, and by the pleura; on the right side also, by the vena azygos ; and, posteriorly, it is in contact with the synovial membrane of the articulation of the ribs with the vertebrae, for which it forms a capsule. The interarticular ligament enters into the articulation of all the ribs, from the second to the tenth inclusive, and is apparent on raising the middle fasciculus of the former liga- ment. It arises from a small tubercle situated between the two articular surfaces on the head of the rib, and passes to be attached to the intervertebral substance. The synovial membrane is reflected upon the half of the articular surface of the rib and vertebra, both above and below, forming two distinct bags, which are separated by the interarticular ligament. Their synovial secretion is very limited. Articulation of the Tubercle of the Rib to the Transverse Process of the Vertebra. Class Diarthrosis.â€”Subdivision Arthrodia. This joint exists in all the ribs excepting- the eleventh and twelfth, and is formed by the contact of these two parts, both of which are covered with cartilage. They are furnished with a small synovial cavity, which secretes more synovia than that of the preceding articulation. The following liga- ments concur in fortifying this joint. The external transverse ligament arises from the apex of

XIX and indelinite, as it does not comprehend in vvliat manner it treats of org-anized matter: I believe, therefore, the term will 1)0 more readily understood, by considering that ana- tomy is that science, which has for its object the investiga- tion of the structure and configuration of organized bodies. As geometry treats of the forms of unorganized substances, so does anatomy treat bn organized bodies; and indeed the parallel may be found even in the language of the two sci- ences ; for as geometry proceeds from points, lines, and sur- faces of mere magnitudes, so does anatomy found its propo- sitions, by assuming existence of certain fundamental tissues or parts, distinguished by the terms fibre, globules, and laminae, as the elements of organized matter. By an org-anized substance we mean an object in which all its constituent parts, organs and systems, are mutually means and ends to each other; each contributing to the support and duration of the whole, and each, therefore, being maintained by the coexistence of all the rest. To convey a knowledge of the structure and texture of the human body, is the principal object of the science of anatomy; for as its mere name implies, and, in contradis- tinction to physiology, it may be said to consider the human subject as a mere organized structure ; while, on the other hand, physiology recognizes man not only as an organized, but at the same time as a living being- (organismus): nor does it stop here ; for the science of psycology leads us still further, and treats of man as an organized, living and intel- lectual being. Again, the science of anatomy of the human subject may be distinguished into general, special and com- parative. General anatomy considers only the general form and denomination of the minute parts, and the variety of those organs, which, taken collectively, constitute the entire or- ganismus, describing their general structure, texture and arrangement. Special anatomy, on the other hand, enters not only into a minute examination of the structure and texture of all the

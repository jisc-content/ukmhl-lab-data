28 general anatomy of muscles. less ang-le into a single central tendon; the rectus femoris offers the best example of this class of muscles: and when the fibres are inserted into one side of a tendon only in a hke manner, it then is termed a semi-penniform muscle. The peculiar use of this oblique attachment of muscular fibres to their tendons, will be mentioned when speaking of the mechanism of muscle. Mechanism of Muscular Motion. As regards the laws according to which the various muscular motions are effected, it is first to be considered, that the bones are merely the passive organs, and that the muscles may be said to act upon them according to the law of mechanics ; the muscles acting upon the bones, and the weight to be raised upon the principle of the lever. But in the investigation of this mechanical law we shall find one great difference in the application of it to the animal frame, when compared with any mechanical instrument; for in the former at first view it seems that the muscular power is not applied to the greatest advantage, but on the contrary, that the force employed is much greater than seems neces- sary for the weight to be moved; while in machines it is always the object to employ no greater force than is equiva- lent to the weight: but we shall find, in carrying further this analogy, that there are several advantages gained by this apparent imperfection, which more than compensate for the expenditure of power. That the mechanical disadvantages at which the muscles act, as far at least as refers to the force they are obliged to use, from the peculiar manner in which they are inserted into bone, may be better understood, I shall first describe the three kinds of lever which are mentioned in mechanics. The first, and that most commonly used for all mechanical purposes, is, that in wdiich the power is at one end, the fulcrum or fixed point in the centre, and the weight or resistance at the other end; w'c employ this lever in poking

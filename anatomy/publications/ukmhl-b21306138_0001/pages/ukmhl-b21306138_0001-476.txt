90 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OP MUSCLES. into the inner side of the angle of the inferior maxillary bone, in a similar manner to the insertion of the masseter on the outer side of the angle of the same bone; the tendons of the two uniting underneath, form a kind of sling for the recep- tion of the lower jaw. This muscle is covered by the as- cending ramus of the lower jaw; it is separated from the pterygoideus externus, by the internal maxillary artery, the lingual gustatory nerve, and cellular membrane ; and along its posterior edge, the internal lateral ligament passes from the styloid process to the angle of the jaw. Use.—When one of these muscles acts, it draws the lower jaw ob- liquely to the opposite side ; when both act, they raise the lower jaw, and close the mouth ; and if they act when the superior and inferior maxillary bones are in contact, they incline the head slightly back- wards. The m. pterygoideus externus—arises from the external root of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, from the root of the temporal process of the same bone, and also from the tuberosity of the os maxillare superius, adjoining the pterygoid process of the sphenoid; at this point being connected with the buccinator, and superior constrictor of the pharynx; from these several origins its fibres pass back- wards and outwards almost transversely, to be inserted into a fossa in the condyloid process of the lower jaw, and into the ligament which surrounds the articulation of this bone with the temporal. This muscle, like the pterygoideus in- ternus, is covered by the ramus of the lower jaw and muscles of the face. Use.—When this muscle acts singly, the jaw is directed forwards, and to the opposite side; when both muscles act, the jaw is moved hori- zontally forwards. > These four muscles are most especially employed in the process of mastication; the action of the temporal and mas- seter preponderates in the preparation of animal food for deglutition ; whilst the pterygoid muscles, from the peculiar motions they give to the lower jaw, are best adapted to break down and triturate vegetable matter; so that the

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 79 Wounds of the cheek are frequently productive of serious conse- quences, from injury to the parotid duct, attended with a constant flow of saliva, and producing a fistulous opening; but on this subject I shall treat more particulary when speaking of the salivary apparatus ; only now recommending the early and perfect adaptation of the edges of the wound. Muscles superficially situated on the anterior part of the Neck. The neck is that part of the trunk situated between the thorax and cranium; it is divided into an anterior and pos- terior surface, each giving attachment to muscles: and those of the anterior region are now to be described. This region is bounded superiorly by the inferior edge of the lower jaw', and mastoid processes of the temporal bones ; inferiorly, by the sterno clavicular articulations, and the upper surfaces of the clavicles; and laterally by the anterior edges of the musculi trapezii, extending from the posterior part of the mastoid processes to the acromial extremities of the cla- vicles. In the median line of this region, the larynx is seen to project, and on either side of this projection the course of the sterno cleido maistoideus muscle is observed through the skin and platysma myoides, converging inferiorly and diverging in the upper and lateral regions ; between the posterior edge of the sterno cleido mastoideus, and the anterior edge of the musculus trapezius, is a triangular depression, the base of which is formed by the clavicle. The muscles situated in the anterior part of the neck are numerous ; but their dissection will be facilitated by taking them in the following order:â€”First, those which are super- ficially situated; secondly, those which fix the os hyoides; thirdly, those which depress the lower jaw; fourthly, the muscles running transversely from the temporal bone to the os hyoides; and, lastly, those which are deeply-seated on the vertebral column. In commencing the dissection of the muscles superficially situated, an incision should be made through the skin only, from the symphisis of the lower jaw to the centre of the

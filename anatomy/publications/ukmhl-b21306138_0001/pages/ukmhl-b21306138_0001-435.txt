DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 49 fascia will be described when speaking- of the parts con- nected with hernia. The musculus transversalis abdominis ames tendinous from that layer of the fascia lumborum w'hich is connected with the transverse processes of the last dorsal, and four superior lumbar vertebra?; also tendinous from the posterior part of the ilium, fleshy from the remaining part of the middle labium ilii, and from the posterior surface of the outer third of Poupart’s ligament, in connexion with the obliqims internus: above it arises from the seven inferior ribs, tendinous from the two last, and fleshy from the five superior, where it is in contact with the origins of the dia- phgram, but does not distinctly, as is usually described, indigitate with them. From these points of attachment the fibres pass transversely to the linea semilunaris, there be- come tendinous, and accompany the posterior layer of the tendon of the internal oblique muscle behind the rectus in the upper three-fourths of its extent to be attached to the linea alba, while the lower fourth passes with the anterior layer of the tendon of the obliquus internus and externus muscles to be inserted into the same line; that portion arising from Poupart’s ligament in common with the musculus ob- liquus internus is attached tendinous to the pubes, forming with it an inseparable insertion. Use.—The transversalis muscle, by its contraction, diminishes the capacity of the abdomen, and necessarily compresses the viscera of that cavity in a similar manner to the oblique muscles, forcing up the diaphragm into the chest; but it further lessens the capacity of the tliorax, by drawing the ribs on one side towards those on the opposite; it also assists in the contortions of the trunk. The musculus cremaster is a small muscle which, in the male, passes out through the external abdominal ring, completely surrounding the spermatic cord; it is composed of fibres which are given oflF from the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, although it is sometimes described as having a distinct origin from Poupart’s ligament and the os ilium; it then passes down with the cord, and spreads itself to be attached to the tunica vaginalis reflexa, into which it E

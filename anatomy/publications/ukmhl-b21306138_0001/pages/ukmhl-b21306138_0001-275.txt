DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 213 ments in being- extremely elastic, and capable of resisting- an extraordinary deg-ree of force. Its anterior face is in contact with the dura mater of the medulla spinalis; poste- riorly it is of a reddish tint, and is with difficulty perceived without producing- flexion of the spine, in consequence of its being- so much covered by the arches of the vertebrce, par- ticularly in the dorsal reg-ion. These lig-aments are very strong-, short, and of a yellowish red color; possessing- such a deg-ree of elasticity, as to assist the muscles in recovering- the erect posture after the spine has been flexed. Articulation of the Articular Processes. Class Diarthrosis.—Subdivision Arthrodia. The faces of the articular processes are covered with cartilag-e, and are connected by synovial membrane, which forms a very small capsule, and secretes but an inconsidera- ble quantity of synovia. On the exterior there are some lig-amentous fibres, which connect the processes more firmly tog-ether, and produce an irreg-ular capsular lig-ament, which is more visible in the dorsal and lumbar than in the cervical reg-ion. The inner edg-e of this capsule is connected with the lig-amentum subflavum. Cervical ligament.—^The cervical lig-ament arises from the perpendicular spine of the occiput, and is inserted into the spinous process of the five superior cervical vertebrae. It is much stronger in quadrupeds than in man; as, from their horizontal posture, such a structure is essentially necessary to support the weight of the head. In man it appears to be of little more use than to give attachment to muscles, although it may, in some degree, assist in maintaining the proper po- sition of the head in the erect posture. Interspinous ligaments.—^These ligaments extend from the apex of one spinous process to that of another, and are situated immediately under the skin. They commence at the sixth cervical vertebra, and extend as far as the sacrum. V 2

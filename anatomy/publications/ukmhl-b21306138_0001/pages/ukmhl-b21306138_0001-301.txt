DESCRimVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 239 The anterior ligament arises from the lower part of the humerus, between the two condyles immediately above the cavity ivhich receives the coronoid process of the ulna in flexion; it also reaches laterally as far as the edg’es of the condyles, over which it passes downwards to be inserted into the coronary ligament of the radius and root of the coronoid process of the ulna: its fibres pass in different directions; those from the internal condyles, with considerable obliquity, to be attached to the coronary ligament of the radius, while the middle and external fibres pass vertically downwards. The posterior ligament arises from the upper part of the cavity in the humerus, which receives the olecranon of the ulna in extension; it passes laterally on the sides of the con- dyles, where it meets with the anterior ligament, and also with the upper edges of the internal and external lateral ligaments ; it is loosely connected with the olecranon, and is inserted into the lower and posterior part of the os humeri, be- tween the two condyles. This ligament can only be entirely exposed when the fore arm is flexed upon the upper. Its posterior surface is covered by the tendon of the triceps, while its anterior is in contact with the synovial membrane, w^hich lines both this and the anterior lig’ament, Exteriial lateral ligament.—This ligament is so inti- mately connected with the tendons of those muscles which arise from the external condyle of the os humeri, as to be with difficulty separated, and does indeed seem to have a common origin with the supinator radii brevis; it is of a tri- angular shape, its apex being situated above and its base below ; it arises from the lower part of the external condyle, becomes broader as it descends, passes over the articulation, then spreads itself so as to surround the head of the radius, and is inserted into the anterior and posterior edges of the smaller sigmoid cavity of the ulna in common with the coro- nary ligament, which it covers. Thus it is clear that the rotatory motion of the radius is not confined by this ligament, as it is inserted only into the ulna and coronary ligament, and is entirely unconnected with the radius itself.

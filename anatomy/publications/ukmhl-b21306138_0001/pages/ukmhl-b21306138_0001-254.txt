192 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. great strength, and a capability of resisting violent concus- sions, united with a tendency to resume its original form after having been either compressed or drawn out by mus- cular action, or any other mechanical force. All these qua- lities are admirably combined in the fibro-cartilage connect- ing the bodies of the vertebrÂ®, generally called the interver- tebral substance; and their utility is beautifully illustrated by the easy flexibihty which the spinal column enjoys, support- ing at the same time the whole weight of the trunk, and bearing the shock of every concussion which the body may receive. We may here observe, that this last mentioned structure bears a great resemblance to that class of true cartilage which we described as connecting bone to bone, in the formation of the pelvis, &c.; and, indeed, this gradual assimilation of one structure to another, will be found to pervade the whole body, and renders classification propor- tionably difficult. We would, however, distinguish the two kinds by observing, that the one allows a manifest degree of motion and compression, while the other suffers only a slight and insensible yielding to take place ; that in the former, fibrous tissue, and in the latter, the true cartilaginous struc- ture is found to predominate. Concerning the use of the third class of fibro-cartilage, nothing farther need be said, except, that by lining grooves and depressions, they form smooth and somewhat yielding structure for the tendons to play over, and are in most places prolonged into sheaths, which bind down the tendons, and prevent them from starting from the bone during the action of the muscles. These sheaths are lined by synovial mem- brane, which connects them to the tendons passing through. Organization of Fibro-Cartilage. Besides the two fibrous and cartilaginous tissues, we find entering into its composition cellular membrane: this is, however, but so little in quantity, and so intimately con- nected with the two former tissues, that it is very difficult to

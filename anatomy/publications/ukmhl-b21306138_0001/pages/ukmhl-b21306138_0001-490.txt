LECTURE XV. DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Muscles of the Upper Extremity. It is here necessary to g’ive the reason why the muscles of the upper extremity should follow before I have finished the description of the muscles of the neck. Had we pro- ceeded, in continuation of the descriptive anatomy of the muscles deeply seated in the neck, we must of necessity have ' removed those muscles of the upper extremity, as they cover the deep-seated muscles of the posterior cervical region; and the student could not have continued this progress of dissection without the destruction of that part of the body. Also, the muscles of the neck not yet described, may with greater propriety be considered separately, as they are not connected with the functions of deglutition and mastication, as those already described. The muscles of the upper extremity are divided into those which attach the scapula to the trunk; those which move the shoulder-joint; those of the elbow-joint; the muscles of the radio ulnar articulations,; muscles of the wrist joint; those common to the fingers; those proper to the fingers ; and, lastly, the muscle of the palmar fascia. The muscles which attach the scapula to the trunk are seven in number, although, if we consider the subclavius muscle as assisting in this attachment, it will make the number eight. They are situ- ated, in relation to the scapula, in the following order:—two above, three behind, and three in front; enumerating the subclavius, which is, however, frequently considered as a muscle proper to the clavicle. The three muscles situated behind the scapula should be

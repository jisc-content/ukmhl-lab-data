THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 158 by a groove for the passag-e of the tendons of the peronei muscles. The internal surface is larg'C, and concave from above to below, to lodg’e the tendons of the m. tibialis posticus, flexor long-us dig-itorum communis, and the flexor long’us pollieis pedis ; and also the vessels and nerves passing’ to the sole of the foot. A slight protuberance may be seen upon the middle of the posterior part of this surface, for the origin of the m. accessorius; and on the anterior and upper part, a sulcus, to lodge exclusively the tendon of the flexor longus pollieis. Attachment of Muscles.—The m. extensor brevis digitorum, to the anterior part of the upper surface; to the under surface, the m. abductor, flexor brevis, and adductor pollieis, flexor brevis digitorum, and ab- ductor minimi digiti; and to its mner surface, the flexor digitorum ac- cessorius. The Navicular, or Scaphoid Bone. This bone is somewhat circular in form, is placed on the inner side of the middle of the foot, and presents an anterior and posterior articular surface, a dorsal and plantar non- articular aspect, and an internal and external extremity. The anterior articular surface is covered with cartilage, is slightly convex from side to side, and presents three distinct faces for the articulation of the three cuneiform bones ; the two outer of these faces are larger above than they are below, while the inner is larger below. The posterior articular surface forms an oblong concavity, to receive the astragalus. The superior, or dorsal aspect, is convex from side to side, and rough for the attachment of ligaments. The inferior, or plantar surface, is also rough, but irre- gularly concave from side to side, to maintain the transverse arch of the foot. The inner extremity forms a projecting tubercle, to which is attached the abductor pollieis, in part, and the tendon of the m. tibialis posticus; and also the strong plantar ligaments.

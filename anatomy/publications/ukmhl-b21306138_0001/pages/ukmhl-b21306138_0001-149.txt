101 BONES OP THE TRUNK. On viewing' the pelvis internally, it will be seen to form two cavities, being' bisected by the linea ilio-pectinea. Tlie upper cavity is formed by the base of the sacrum and the ex- panded surfaces of the ilia; and the lower is bounded, anteri- orly, by the ossa pubis; laterally, by the ischia ; and posteri- orly, by the united sacrum and os coccyx, and by the ischiatic notches. The pelvis also presents two circumferences; an upper and a lower one. The upper one may be traced from where the lumbar vertebra unites wdth the sacrum, to the anterior and superior spinous processes of the ilia, the circle being' com- pleted in the recent subject by the abdominal muscles, thus forming- the upper or abdominal cavity of the pelvis. The in- ferior circumference, or outlet, is marked by three eminences, viz., the tuberosities of the ischia and the os coccyg'is; and by three depressions, the arch of pubes in front, and the two ischiatic notches laterally. It is the comparative dilFerence in the distance of these parts from each other, which consti- tutes the g-rand disting-uishing- mark between the male and the female pelvis,—the outlet being much more capacious in the female than in the male. But besides this characteristic of the female pelvis, all its lateral dimensions greatly prepon- derate: w'hile, in the male, the perpendicular dimensions are most considerable. The great size of the outlet from the female pelvis is to facilitate parturition; and in a well-formed skeleton the follow- ing measurements are given :—From the upper part of the arch of the pubes, to the articulation of the os coccygis with the sacrum,—from one ischium to the other,—and also from the pubes to the sacro-iliac symphysis, the distance, in each direction, being four inches, comprising therefore a circle, the diameter of which is four inches,—consequently, its cir- cumference is about twelve.

268 GENERAL ANATOMY OF CELLULAR MEMBRANE. in others its power of resistance equals that of perfect fibres : for instance, the cellular membrane in the interior of a muscle, appears principally for the connection of its parts, and is there more distinctly fibrous: while in the axilla, and those parts destined for extensive motion, it not only forms a connecting" medium, but secretes a halitus to lubri- cate its surface, and presents, when floated in water, a peculiar soft flosculent appearance. The cellular membrane has a free communication between its cells, as is seen in emphysema, ecchymosis, and anarsarca ; but some difference of opinion exists reg^arding the free permeability of this structure, it having been supposed by some physiologists that each cell naturally secretes and re- absorbs individually, and it is only in a state of disease that a free communication and infiltration takes place. This variance in opinion seems to me to be decided by the fact, that in artificial, or accidental inflation, the air is readily re- absorbed without any ill effects ; a circumstance which we could not suppose would take place under even slight laceration of parts. The cellular membrane derives its arteries from the mi- nutest branches, which, in most situations, seem only ca- pable of circulating the colorless parts of the blood. This arterial distribution must not be confounded with the nu- merous branches which are transmitted and protected in their passage to other structures. The arteries themselves receive their vasa vasorum entirely from the vessels of the surrounding cellular membrane ; hence an artery dies when deprived of its cellular covering. Nerves, in a like manner, may be traced through cellular membrane, in their course to other structures; but it re- mains uncertain whether this tissue itself possesses any nerves; and we are led to this conclusion, as it does not manifest any sensibility, excepting in a state of inflammation, when the degree of sensibility may probably depend upon the tension produced by its swelling on the other parts in connection with it. This opinion is strengthened by the

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 145 The extensors are, the extensores carpi radialis long-ior et brevior, extensor carpi ulnaris, tlie extensor tertii inter- nodii, extensor indicis, and the common extensors to the fingers; it is however the first three of these muscles only which are to be considered as acting primarily upoij the wrist-joint. The inflection of the hand towards the radius, is produced by the action of the extensor primi internodii, or extensor ossis metacarpi, extensor secundi internodii (usually termed the primi), extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and the flexor carpi radialis. The inflection of the hand towards the ulna, is produced by the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum communis, more especially by that portion of tendon which passes to the little finger, the flexor carpi ulnaris and the common flexors of the fingers. The slight degree of motion which takes place between the bones of the carpus and metacarpus, does not appear to be under the control of muscular contraction, but rather to depend upon the application of some external force ; and is not therefore now to be considered further than as an illustration of the propriety of naming the first bone of the thumb as a phalanx, rather than as a metacarpal bone. The motions of the thumb are produced by eight muscles, a flexor and extensor proper to each phalanx, and an ab- ductor and adductor common to the three. Thus the motions of the first phalanx upon the os trape- zium are, flexion—by the flexor primi internodii, or ossis metaearpi; extension—by the extensor primi internodii, or extensor ossis metacarpi; abduction and adduction — by corresponding muscles: besides a rotatory motion, which is produced by the quick and successive action of each of these muscles. The second phalanx only moves upon the first, in flexion and extension ; and is furnished therefore with the flexor and extensor secundi internodii. I, /

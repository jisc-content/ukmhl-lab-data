DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 64 abrupt on the inner side, so that the fascia transversalls appears to extend almost transversely from Gimbernat’s lig'ament to the outer side of the femoral vessels. On openlng^ the sheath the artery will be found separated from the vein by a slight process sent down between them. On the inner side of the vein are situated the deep-seated absorbents of the lower extremity: some of which are continued upwards into the abdomen, while others pierce the sheath to reach the inguinal glands. From this latter circumstance the name of fascia cribriformis has been given to that portion of the fascia transversalis which covers the inner side of the vein, and extends from it to Gimbernat’s ligament. It is altogether of a looser and more yielding texture, rendering it occasionally insufficient to prevent the descent of a femoral hernia; for, from the foregoing description, it will be manifest, that any portion of the abdominal viscera, making its escape by the side of the vessels, must be opposed in its progress by their sheath. The opening which allows the passage of a crural hernia under Poupart’s ligament, is that occupied by the absorbents on the inner side of the vein: it is called the femoral or crural ring; and is bounded on the outer side by the vein, on the inner by Gimbernat’s ligament, before by Poupart’s ligament lined by fascia transversalis, behind by the pubes covered by fascia iliaca. Into this opening the finger may readily be insinuated from the abdominal cavity, especially when the peritoneum is removed; but its progress downwards towards the thigh is checked by coming in contact with the fascia cribriformis extending, as it were, across the opening from the femoral vein to Gimbernat’s ligament. This resisting structure, however, gradually yields before the pressure of a hernia, until at length the fascia cribriformis, together with a quantity of loose cellular tissue which assists in filling up the ring, becomes dilated into a pouch, which contains the peritoneal sac ; and, projecting through the crescentic open- ihg of the fascia, is immediately subjacent to the superficial aponeurosis. Thus although the hernia, while passing

168 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. diminish in bulk as they ascend. They are of an unequal length, and intimately connected with each other; in some instances the origin and insertion extend only from one vertebra to the next, in others extend over two or three vertebrae, before they are inserted. The multifidi spinoe arise from the spinous processes and posterior surface of the sacrum, and adjoining portion of the ilium ; from the articular and transverse processes of all the lumbar, from the transverse processes of all the dorsal and cervical vertebrae, excepting the three uppermost; from these several origins, the fibres separate into distinct fas- ciculi to be inserted tendinous into the spinous processes of all the lumbar, dorsal, and cervical vertebrae, excepting the first. These muscles are deeply seated, lying on the bones of the spine, and are covered by the semi-spinalis dorsi and the semi-spinalis colli. Use.—To support and extend the spinal column obliquely, when the muscles of one side aet; and also to give some slight rotatory motion of one vertebra upon another. The m. interspinales—are small fasciculi of muscular fibres placed, as their name implies, between the spinous processes of all the vertebrae, and are divided into the inter- spinales cervicis, dorsi, et lumborum. The m. interspinales cervicis.—In consequence of the bifurcation of the spinous processes of these vertebrae, the interspinal muscles are usually described as being double, a separate fasciculus being connected with each portion of the divided process ; they are contracted at each extremity, and thickest in their centre. These muscles sometimes are continuous for the length of three or four vertebrae, and in other subjects distinct. Use.—To draw the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrre towards each other, and consequently to extend the neck. The m. interspinales dorsi—are much less distinct than the preceding muscles, and indeed are frequently wanting ;

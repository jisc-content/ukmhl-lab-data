ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES, 26T immediately under the anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium. The capsular and interarticular ligaments are put upon the stretch, in consequence of the disposition of the head of the thig-h-bone to leave the cotyloid cavity; it is forcibly pressed on the anterior part of its capsule, w'hich is, in this situation, rendered strong-er by the accessory ligament, as before described. Thirdly, abduction.—In this action the thigh is separated from the other laterally; the great trochanter is, when ab- duction is carried to its fullest extent, brought into contact with the dorsum of the ilium; the internal part of the cap- sular ligament and ligamentum teres are stretched. Fourthly, adduction.—This motion consists of little more than the return of the limb to its natural position, after ab- duction has been performed; but it can be carried to a greater degree, so as to make the superior extremity of one thigh- bone cross the other; in which case the trochanter major is carried a little below, and anterior to, its natural situation. The capsular and interarticular ligaments are somewhat stretched. Fifthly, rotation.—This maybe either outwards ox inwards; the former action seems to be more consistent with the posi- tion of the limb ; and we find, therefore, an infinitely greater muscular apparatus to produce it, than to roll the thigh in- wards. When this motion is carried to its greatest extent, the great troehanter is thrown behind the acetabulum, and the head of the bone is thrown forward, pressing against the capsular ligament. In the latter case the inferior extremity of the femur is turned inwards, and the trochanter so broufflit O forward towards the spine of the ilium, as to make a percep- tible projection under the skin ; and the head of the bone turns upon its own axis, towards the back part of the aceta- bulum. In these rotatory motions, the foot should not be made the guide by which w'e can judge of their extent, as that is influenced by the motions of all the joints of the in- ferior extremity. Sixthly, circumduction.—This is produced by the quick

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 171 Use.—To bend the spine, and with it the thorax, laterally towards the pelvis; to draw down the last rib in expiration; and, if both muscles act, also to support the spine in the erect position of the body. Havino’ now described all the muscles which are connected o with the ribs, without adverting- particularly to their office in the function of respiration, it is necessary now to speak of their important action in the elevation and depression of those bones. It may be observed, that respiration consists of the pas- sage of a certain quantity of air into the lungs, termed in- spiration ; and the expulsion of a similar quantity, named expiration. The lungs, the receptacle of the air we breathe, are contained laterally within the thorax; the enlargement of which to admit of the increased volume of the lungs during inspiration, and its contraction during expiration, constitute the act of respiration. The motion of the ribs upon the spine, admit of the enlargement of the chest in the following manner .-—Laterally, by the turning outwards, and elevation of the bodies of the ribs ; anteriorly, by the thrusting forwards of the sternum, in consequence of the elevated ribs occupying a larger space ; and the capacity of the chest is further increased from above to below, princi- pally by the depression of the diaphragm, and by the eleva- tion of the first ribs and sternum. With regard to the motion of the first rib upwards, considerable difference of opinion exists; and some physiologists consider that this rib is stationary, and forms a fixed point for the action of the intercostal muscles, and necessary elevation of the ribs below. On examination, however, it will be found, that the first rib possesses a more extensive motion than any of the others ; for, while the lower ribs turn only upon their own axis on the spinal column, the first ribs have a distinct elevation throughout their whole length, being raised by the scalenus anticus and medius; and in connection with the ' sternum, their elevation is also assisted by the action of the sterno cleido mastoideus. This fact is proved by the enlargement of the upper

76 DESCtllPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. merits and platysma myoides, and partly cover the bucei- natores and depressores labii inferioris. depress the angle of the mouth, and to assist the last de- scribed muscle in producing the expression of grief. Having" concluded the anatomical description of the muscles situated on the exterior of the cranium and face, I am desirous of detailing their physiological relations, in such a manner as to convey a conception of their multiplied and varied actions as connected with the function of respira- tion, and with the physiology and theory of expression. In the first place it will be remembered, that of the muscles of the face three are orbicular, surrounding the eyes and the mouth; and that the rest may be regarded as varying- and modifying the direction of their action: and, secondly, that the muscles of the face are peculiar in moving the integuments ; while the osseous parts beneath remain fixed. Bearing in mind these two facts, we shall find a ready explanation of all the modifications of their action and ex- pression ; whether induced by natural, excited, or impeded respiration, or by the feelings and passions of the mind. I would however observe, that notwithstanding all that has been said on the subject of physionomical expression; not- withstanding the many learned disquisitions that have been entered into, respecting the influence of feeling and passion upon the countenance; more mystery has, I think, been thrown over the subject, than it will, on a minute and care- ful examination, be found to deserve. We know that the expression of countenance in one whose respiration is greatly hurried or much impeded, is sufficiently explained by the consideration of the action of those muscles which are ne- cessarily called into action by the increased necessity for their exertion. In this case, at least, the mere anatomical explanation is satisfactory, as to the expression ; but in other instances, where certain passions or emotions are expressed, the connection between the passion or emotion, and the expression of countenance, is less obvious: and hence it is, that we are for the most part content with the fact, without

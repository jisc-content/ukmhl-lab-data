DESCRimVE ANATOMY OK ARTICULATIONS. 251 Motions of the IVrist-Joint. The hand moves on the fore arm, so as to allow of flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and slight circular motion. Witli respect to the motions of flexion and extension, this joint differs from all others, in allowing extension to the same e.xtent as fle.xion; indeed, it is the direction in which the hand is most frequently employed. The slightest circular motion of the hand upon the radius, assists in the perfect perform- ance of the movements of pronation and supination. Articulation of the Bones of the Carpus' with each other. Class Diarthrosis.—Subdivision Arthrodia. I have already mentioned, that the first, or cubital row of the carpus, receives its synovial membrane, for its junction with the radius, from a prolongation of the membrane of the radio carpal articulation; but this joint is further strength- ened by other ligaments, which connect the bones of this row firmly together, and are situated between these bones on their anterior and on their posterior surfaces. Interosseous ligaments.—These are short but very strong ligaments, which connect the scaphoid, the lunar, and the cuneiform bones: they are composed of dense fibres, which are laterally united firmly to each bone; their superior face is covered with the synovial membrane of the radio-carpal arti- culation, to which they are attached. The anterior or palmar ligament is found situated imme- diately under the anterior ligament of the wrist-joint, takes an oblique direction from without to within, being connected to the scaphoid, lunar, and cuneiform bones ; and as it passes from one of these bones to the other, connects itself with the interosseal ligaments. The posterior or dorsal ligament has attachment to the same bones as the palmar ligament; its posterior surface is

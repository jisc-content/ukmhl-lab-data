LECTURE XVII. DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Muscles of the Perinceum. The next part to be dissected, having' finished the muscles which are connected with the ribs, and which perform the function of respiration, are the muscles of the perinaeum, which are better displayed before, than after the dissection of the muscles of the lower extremities. The perinseum is that part of the body which is placed between the anus and the org-ans of g-eneration ; it is of a triangular form; bounded above, or rather in front, in the erect posture of the body, by the scrotum in the male, and by the vulva in the female; by the anus, behind and below ; and by the rami of the pubes and ischia, laterally. This space is much larger in the male than in the female ; and of the former I shall first treat. To dissect this part in the male, the subject should be placed and confined in precisely the same position, as for the operation for the stone; a sound should be passed into the bladder, the handle of this instrument being fastened with the penis attached to it at a right angle with the hori- zontal position of the trunk, and the scrotum being held to one side, the dissection may proceed. But before the knife is used, the student should place an articulated pelvis in the same position with that of the subject; so that he may learn the precise relative bearing of the bony parts, with respect to each other; by the just knowledge of which, all the operations connected with this part can only be properly understood. Next, he should examine the perinceum of the subject, and he will find the

XXlll INTOODUCTORY LECTURE over the entire surface of the body. As the objects of his wants may be more or less distant, it is requisite that man, in order to attain them, should possess the power of loco- motion, and a form suited to the exercise of that power. A secure basis being' absolutely essential to his support, the whole structure is firmly secured by a substance termed BONE ; which, like a frame-work, g-ives support and protec- tion to the surrounding- soft parts, and maintains his proper stature. That they may not add too much to the weig-lit of the body, the bones are formed hollow, and are thus ren- dered much lighter than they would be if solid, yet without suffering any diminution of their strength. The bones being the basis of locomotion, and, as such, being required to permit the most rapid and varied movements of the body, would utterly fail to answer that purpose if they formed one conti- nuous mass ; wherefore, like a complex and ingenious piece of mechanism, they are found divided into a great number of parts, so disposed as to play easily, and adapt themselves readily to every act of the body, and to every change of atti- tude and posture. At their extremities we find a substance, admirably adapted by its smoothness and elasticity, to prevent concussion and friction; this substance is called cartilage. In those joints which are .entirely subject to the influence of the will, this substance is found merely tipping the ends of the bones ; but in parts where motion is consi- derably restricted, we find cartilagâ€™es firmly uniting bone to bone: as, for instance, the ribs to the sternum. Not only are the extremities of bones protected by, this substance, but friction between them is still farther prevented b}^ a fluid termed synovia, which is poured from the extremities of arteries terminating by open mouths in the internal surface of a synovial membrane, which prevents the escape of the fluid. This apparatus is always found at articulating- sur- faces ; and the quantity of synovia supplied is always pro- portioned to the extent of motion in the joint, and to the consequent danger of displacement. Another structure forming part of every articulation is ligament; so called, from (

DESCIUPTIVE ANATOMY OF ARTICULATIONS. 2fi3 on the outer side, to the scaphoid and the trapezium ; on tlie inner sine, to the cuneiform and unciform bones. The anterior and posterior ligaments are formed of short, strong-, fibrous fasciculi, which pass in various directions from the cubital to the digital row. They are situated immedi- ately underneath the lig-aments of the radio carpal articu- lation, with which they form a strong fibrous covering to the whole of the carpus. The synovial membrane not only covers the articulatory surfaces by which the bones of the two rows of the carpus are connected with each other, but also insinuates itself be- tween the bones of each row, so as to form a synovial cavity, prolonging itself both superiorly and inferiorly upon the arti- culatory surfaces of every bone, excepting the pisiform. Articulation of the Carpus with the Metacarpus. Articulation of the Metacarpal Bone of the Thumb with the Os Trapezium. Class Biarthrosis.â€”Subdivision Arthrodia. Til is joint is connected by a strong capsular ligament, which is formed of longitudinal fibres, passing from the neck of the metacarpal bone of the thumb to the edge of the arti- culatory surface on the trapezium. It is loose, having its internal surface lined by synovial membrane, while its ex- ternal surface, particularly, is strengthened by the muscles of the thumb. Articulation of the four last Metacarpal Bones with the Carpus. The four otlier bones of the metacarpus are connected with the carpal bones by synovial membrane, which is a con- tinuation of that of the carpus, and by dorsal and palmar

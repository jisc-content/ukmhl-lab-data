210 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. immediately below the origin of the soleiis muscle, and ex- tending" three lourths down the bone, from the interosseous ligament, and from the anterior surface of the deep fascia ol the leg; the fleshy fibres from these origins descend obliquely inwards, being thickest in their middle part, and ^ terminate in a tendon which commences at the internal and posterior part of the muscle. The tendon then passes behind the raalleous internus in the same groove with, but below, the tibialis posticus, and passing on the inner sinuosity of the os calcis, reaches the sole of the foot, in the middle of which it divides into four tendons; these diverge, proceed forwards to the bases of the first phalanges, where they enter ten- dinous the thecBe, and passing through the split tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum at the extremities of the first phalanges, are inserted into the extreme phalanges of the four lesser toes. The anterior surface of this muscle lies upon the tibia, and interosseous ligament; above, to the inner side of the tibialis posticus, which it partly covers; and below, on the inner side of the flexor longus pollicis; it is covered behind by the posterior tibial artery, and deep fascia of the leg. Use.—To flex the third upon the second phalanx; but if still in action, to bend the other phalanges of the toes, and the toes themselves upon the metatarsus, and ultimately to assist in the extension of the foot. The m. flexor longus pollicis pedis—arises fleshy from a flat surface on the posterior part of the fibula, commencing immediately below the attachments of the soleus, and reach- ing to within an inch of the inferior extremity of the bone ; its fibres pass obliquely downwards and inwards, and ter- minate in a tendon which takes its course behind the inner malleolus, through a groove which is formed first in the tibia, and then continued in the astragalus, where it is pos- terior to the tendon of the last described muscle; reaches the sole of the foot where it passes above the tendon of the flexor digitorum, and is connected with it by a slip of tendon; it then proceeds between the two origins of the flexor brevis polhcis, between the two sesamoid bones ; and penetrating*

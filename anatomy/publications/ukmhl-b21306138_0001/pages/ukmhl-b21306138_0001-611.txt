225 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. feraorisj tensor vag'insc femoris, obturator cxternus 5 and perhaps some few of the anterior fibres of the gâ€™lutaei, as well as thfe g-racilis and sartorius, two muscles of the knee- joint: all these muscles, excepting- the first three, have other direet functions to perform. Extension of the hip-joint, is effected principally by the three g-lutaei museles, aided however by the obturator in-, ternus, gemini, quadratus femoris, and adductor magnus, all muscles of the hip-joint; and by the semitendinosus, semi- membranosus, and long head of the biceps, which are muscles of the knee-joint. Abduction of the hip-joint, is performed by the three glutsei, tensor vaginae femoris, pyriformis, gemini, and ob- turator internus of the hip, and sartorius of the knee-joint; the three glutaei are to be considered as the principal mus- cles in abduction. Adduction of the hip-joint, is produced by the adductor triceps femoris, the quadratus femoris, obturator externus, peetineus, psoas magnus, and iliacus of the hip ; semitendi- nosus, semimembranosus, long head of the biceps, and gracilis, of the knee-joint. Rotation outwards, by the pyriformis, gemini, obturatores, and quadratus femoris; assisted by the iliacus, psoas mag- nus, glutaeus magnus, raedius, and triceps adductor femoris; all of the hip-joint. Rotation inwards, by the tensor vaginae femoris, anterior fibres of the glutaeus medius and minimus; assisted by the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus of the knee-joint. All these muscles successively in action, produce circum- duction of the hip-joint, assisted by motions of the trunk; and when the thigh-bones are fixed, corresponding motions are produced of the pelvis. In taking a retrospective view of the motions of the hip, and comparing the functions of this joint with those of the shoulder, we may observe a considerable difference, in the pelvis not being in the same manner capable of accommo- dating itself to the motions of the femora, as the scapula} arc Q

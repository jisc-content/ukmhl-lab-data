ANATOMY OF HAIRS, J.HE hairs and nails are termed the appendag'es of the skin ; the former, however, do not arise immediately from the skin, but from the cellular membrane beneath it; projecting’ more or less beyond the inner surface of the cutis, according to their size and stiffness. The structure of a hair is as follows:—It is formed of a cylindrical tube, of a horny consistence, pointed at its free extremity, and terminating in a soft bulbous enlargement at its attachment, containing a gelatinous lymph. This bulbous enlargement is of a lighter colour than the length- ened tube which proceeds from it, and has a perforation rather to one side of the bulbous extremity, where it is soft and pulpy, and encloses the vessels which communicate with the membrane that lines the interior of the tube. From this membrane, and more particularly that part within the bulb, an oleaginous fluid is secreted, which communicates colour to the hair; being of different shades, from a transparent white to a jet black tint. The bulbous extremity of the hair is enclosed in a mem- branous sheath and capsule, which is closely connected with the cutis and cellular membrane. Several small filaments pass from the membranous sheath, called its roots; these form a firm attachment for the hair, and probably contain vessels, which furnish the oily secretion of the membrane of the internal tubular cavity. Anatomists have enumerated other structures connected with the bulb: namely, a second membrane lining’ the cap- sule, of a red colour, soft and thin, and said to be a continu- ation of the rete mucosum: and within the cavity of the bulb, numerous conical papillae, which are attached to the sides of the cavity at their bases, having their apices free

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 14T thorax, rather than towards the upper and posterior boundary of the axilla, in which direction the large vessels are situated, lying upon the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The brachial artery begins at the lower boundary of the axilla, and continues down along the inner side of the two upper thirds of the arm, after which it lies on the anterior surface of the inferior third ; which course being remembered, the surgeon is thereby required to use parti- cular caution in operating in that direction. In abscesses under the fascia of the arm, attention must be paid to the precise situation of the matter, whether it be in the anterior or posterior fascial bag; if in the front cavity, the surgeon should direct his lancet anterior to the intermuscular tendons, leading on the outer side from the deltoid muscle to the external condyle, and on the inner side from the coraco brachialis to the internal condyle; the same respective attention is necessary if the abscess be situated in the posterior part of the arm. The surgical'remarks connected with venesection at the elbow, will be mentioned when treating of blood-vessels. Wounds of this part are of importance, from the proximity to the surface of its numerous vessels, and from the little protection the bones of this joint afford to them. Wounds of the fore arm are of more importance on the anterior than the posterior surface, in consequence of the situation of the blood- vessels ; and from their frequent division, the surgeon should be well acquainted with their relative position to the muscles. The operations necessary for securing these vessels will be given when treating of the arteries. Abscesses of the hand are rendered dangerous from the thickness of the skin and fascia of the palm, which, being of so dense a nature, the process of ulceration goes on so slowly that violent constitutional symptoms arise from the confinement of the matter; and hence the necessity of early openings immediately fluctuation can be discovered.

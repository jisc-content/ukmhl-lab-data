ARTICULATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES, 273 The anterior crucial ligament, which arises from the inner and back part of the external condyle, and is directed ob- licpieJy downwards and forwards to a depression in the front part of the spine of the tibia, to which it is attached between tlie anterior cornua of the semilunar cartilag’es : it is covered before by the synovial membrane, and is in contact behind with the posterior crucial lig’ament. This is the ligament, which, in the semiflexed position of the knee-joint, prevents the rotation of the tibia inwards, excepting in a very slight degree. The posterior crucial ligament crosses the direction of the preceding, arising from the internal condyle, and passing- outwards, although not with the same degree of obliquity as the anterior, to be attached to the posterior part of the spine of the tibia; its course is but little out of the vertical line; its base, which is connected with the tibia, is continued to be attached to the external semilunar cartilage ; behind, it is covered by the posterior ligament of the joint, and by the middle articular arteries ; while before, it is apphed to the anterior crucial ligament. The semilunar cartilages are situated between the con- dyles of the femur and the upper face of the tibia, which they render more concave: they are, as their name implies, of a semilunar form, and much thicker at their greater than at their smaller circumference ; they are less in extent of sur- face than the upper part of the tibia, not occupying more than its two external thirds, and are distinguished according to their relative situation, into internal and external. The internal is nearly semicircular, rather longer and larger behind than before ; its convex edge is turned in- wards, and is connected with the internal lateral ligament; its anterior extremity is attached to the spine of the tibia, and to the anterior crucial ligament; its posterior extremity is fixed to the tibia, and to the posterior ligament of Winslow. The external forms a greater share of the segment of a circle than the preceding; is larger before than behind; its convex edge is turned outwards, and is in contact behind u ilh T

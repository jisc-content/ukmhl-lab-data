272 OENltUAL ANATOMY 01<’ CELLULAR MEMBRANE. From accidental causes extravasation of blood sometimes takes place into the cellular membrane producing’ ecchy- mosis. Extravasation of other fluids may also occur ; these fill the cells, in which they produce a greater or less degree of inflammation, depending on the quantity and quality of their nature ; the most severe of which is from extravasation of urine. Occasionally needles find their way into the cellular membrane, and traverse the body in a remarkable manner through its substance ; they do not find their way from cell to cell, but are supposed to be moved by particular processes of inflammation,—ulcerative inflammation in front, suppura- tive on the surface in contact with the needle, and the adhesive behind. Other foreign bodies, such as bullets, are occasionally lodged in the cellular membrane; when a membrane en- closes them, which supports them in their situation, and prevents them from irritating the parts around. Should, however, inflammation be set up from any accidental cause, they will occasionally change their situation, or be thrown out from the body. Adipose Membrane. Is so called from the adeps, a peculiar substance it se- cretes. Whether this is a distinct membrane from the cellular, is a point by no means clearly ascertained by physiologists ; the only grounds for such an hypothesis seem to arise from the peculiar form in which adeps is deposited, being invariably in grains, of a rounded or ovoid shape, attached at one extremity by a peduncle, supposed to be formed of its secreting vessels. It is questionable whether each granule is enclosed in a distinct envelope of membrane, which existed prior to the secretion of the fat; or whether it is derived from a secretion simultaneous with that of the adeps; and as it does not appear that any anatomist has been able to demonstrate this adipose membrane independent of the secretion of adeps, and as it is allowed by Bedard, Bichat,

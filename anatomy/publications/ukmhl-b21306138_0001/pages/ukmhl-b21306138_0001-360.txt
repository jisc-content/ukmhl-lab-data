THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 298 has already been said, the skull is elastic, and but little liable, therefore, to sustain injury from concussion: and during youth, up to the period of manhood, we find the periphery of the skull in parts thickened in proportion to the rest, the sutures perfected, the diploe developed, and every means employed to protect the brain, at that period of life when all the functions are most powerful and active: and lastly, in advanced age, all these apparent provisions against injury actually disappear; and the slow, cautious step of age, points out how ill fitted the bones of the skull now are to resist the ill effects of concussion upon the brain. Having said thus much on the general structure, configu- ration, and provisions against injury of the skull, I shall con- clude this part of my subject by briefly adverting to the varieties observed in the skulls of the different races of man- kind. Although in distinguishing the varieties of the human race, there are many points of the org-anization which claim atten- tion, the peculiarities in the form of the cranium are the most strildng and important, and it is on them that Blumenbaeh has principally founded his five grand, divisions of the human race. 1 First.—In the Caucasian or European variety, the head is of the , most symmetrical shape, often almost round; the forehead is of moderate extent, but full and not retreating; the face bears the smaller proportion to the rest of the head, it is oval and straight; the nose narrow and aquiline; the cheek bones rather narrow, without any projection, but having- a direction downwards from the malar process of the frontal bone ; the alveolar edge is rounded, and the front teeth of each jaw are placed perpendicularly ; the chin is full, round, and somewhat prominent. Second.—In the Mongolian the head is almost square; the forehead broad and flat; the proportion of the cranium to the face nearly one tenth less than in the European; the face broad and flattened; tire cheek bones projecting out- wards; the nasal bones, and the space between the eyebrows.

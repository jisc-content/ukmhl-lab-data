LECTURE Xll. \ GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, ^l^HE muscular system comprehends that soft part of the body which is, in common lang'uag'c, termed flesh : the sub- stance itself, from the power it possesses of contraction, has been denominated muscle from the greek (/.lunv, to con- tract. This faculty cannot be traced to any chemical or mechanical effect, but to a peculiar inherent tendency the muscular fibre has to shorten, upon the application of a sti- mulus, which, in ordinary circumstances, is communicated to it throug-h the nervous system. As this is the structure which gives motion to the solids as well as to the fluids, and indeed regulates the locomotive power of the whole body, it forms, as might be supposed from the variety of functions in which it so actively assists, a very considerable part of the corporeal substance, adding much to the weight and marking the general outline and contour of the human frame; for although the skeleton bears so strong* a resemblance to the figure of the body, yet the eye of the anatomist cannot dwell for a moment on the articulated bones without seeing the necessity for other structures to determine the rounded exterior form of the human subject. I shall now proceed to describe the general characteristics and physical properties of this system, that it may at once be distinguished from the other systems and tissues which enter into the composition of the human body. The muscular system may at once be recognised and dis- tinguished from the other parts of the organismus, being composed of a number of fleshy fasciculi, which are soft, moist, slightly elastic and semi-transparent; formed of longi- tudinal and parallel fibres, which are irritable and contractile;

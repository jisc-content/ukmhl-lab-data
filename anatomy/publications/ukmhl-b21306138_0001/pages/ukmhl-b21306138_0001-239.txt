THE COMPOSITION OF JOINTS. 177 composition of articulations; and, thirdly, where it lines depressions in the bones, for the purpose of facilitating' the motions of tendons. Of the first and third kind I shall not now treat, but leave them for more minute description when speaking- of the particular parts to wdiich they belong. Articular Cartilages. From what has already been said of the physical proper- ties of cartilage, more especially from its elasticity, we should expect to find it in those situations most subjected to pres- sure, concussion, and contortion ; hence it occurs between all the connecting surfaces of bones, to a greater or less extent, as they are subjected to these contingencies ; and, moreover, we find that these cartilages differ both in struc- ture and form, according to the kind of motion to which they are subservient. It becomes therefore necessary to subdi- vide articular cartilages into four classes :â€”First, when it covers the articulatory processes of those bones admitting of the greatest extent of motion, and subjected to the most pressure; having one surface so firmly connected to the bone, that it seems as a continuous structure, destitute of phos- phate of lime; whilst its other free or articular surface is covered by synovial membrane, which separates it from the cartilage of the corresponding bone entering into that joint. The texture of these cart'dages consist of fibres, passing in the same direction as those of the bones from which they emanate, and becoming softer towards their free or synovial extremities. The second class of articular cartilages is comprehended in those which connect the edges of flat bones, and which admit of no greater extent of motion between them than their yielding nature will allow. These cartilages have two of their surfaces continuous with the bones wdiich they con- nect, while the rest of their surfaces are covered with peri- chondrium. In this class the sutural cartilages of the bones N

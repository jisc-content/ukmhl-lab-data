p descriptive anatomy of muscles, 57 requires, should the taxis and other recommended means fail, an operation; which is performed by laying bare, one by one, the coverings of the protruded intestine: first, the skin, in the whole length and course of the tumour; secondly, the fascia superjicialis, and in this cut a branch of the external epigastric artery is divided, and does some- times require a ligature; thirdly, the tendon of the external oblique is split up cautiously, in the same direction as the other incisions : and now the inguinal canal is exposed, and in it the hernial sac, bounded below by Poupartâ€™s ligament and cremaster muscle; above, by the free edges of the internal oblique andtransversalis muscles, which are separated from the cremaster by the protruding tumour; and behind, by the cord. Before the hernial sac is opened, the surgeon should examine the precise situation of the cord, as it does sometimes happen to be split, so that the vessels may be in front of the tumour, and the vas deferens behind ; having ascertained this fact, the sac is in the most cautious manner to be opened, and split up upon a director the whole length of the tumour ; during which operation, more ' or less fluid generally escapes. The narrowest part of the tumour is now perfectly exposed, which is called the neck, and which is, in fact, the seat of the stricture, caused by the compres- sion of the internal ring ; and, as has been lately discovered by Sir Astley Cooper, is produced by fibres of the trans- versalis muscle, which passes first from the ilium in front of the cord, winds round it, gets thus behind it, and passes back again to the ilium; thus forming the ring into a complete sphincter muscle, and readily explains, both ana- tomically and pathologically, the seat and cause of stricture on the intestine, as well as the rationale of the effects of bleeding, tobacco, &c., in strangulated inguinal hernia. The stricture is now to be divided by passing a director between the bowel and the sac ; or, should there be omentum as well as intestine, it should be placed between the director and bowel, as injury to that membrane is of much less importance than to the intestine; then passing a hernia-knife along the i

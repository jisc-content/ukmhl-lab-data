20 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. First.—Both the extremities of the fibres of the contract- ing- muscle may remain fixed during the time of contraction; as is exemplified in the action of the diaphragm, of the muscles of the abdomen, and of the buccinator. Secondly.—Both their extremities may be in motion, as happens during the contraction of all the sphincter muscles, as all those of the stomach, and intestines. And, Thirdly.—One extremity of the acting muscle may be fixed while the other is moveable; this state may be best observed in the contraction of most of the voluntary muscles. The contraction of a muscle then, on the application of stimuli, sufficiently attests its irritability; but it has been supposed by some, that its irritability is not proved merely by its ordinary contraction under such circumstances, but that it is also manifested in the change which certain muscles are observed to undergo after having been me- chanically put upon the stretch, as seen in the extension of the abdominal muscles during uterine gestation, and ascites. It is right, however, to remark, that this pheno- menon has received from some physiologists a different explanation; for, regarding the entire length of a muscle as made up of distinct ultimate fibres, united by interposed cellular tissue, they suppose the mechanically increased length of the muscle to result, not from any inherent pro- perty of the muscular fibre itself, but from the physical extension of the cellular tissue. The power of contraction of muscular fibre, upon the ap- plication of a stimulus, continues for some time after death; but the precise period for which this capability of being ex- cited lasts is not the same in all muscles; and it also depends upon the state of the individual’s health just prior to death, as well as on the cause of dissolution; for it is found that very sudden death, such as that by lightning, removes at once all contractile power in the muscular system. The following- order has been of late assumed, as being that according to which the extinction of muscular irritability takes place suc- cessively after decapitation. First, the aortic ventricles;

8 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. lor tliem by taking off the pressure of the column of blood from their coats. The absorbents of muscles, neither in structure nor in dis- tribution, offer any thing peculiar; they are rather supposed than proved to arise by a minute ramification from the ultimate fibre, and then proceeding with the blood vessels to the sur- face of the muscle, they may be demonstrated taking their course in the interstitial spaces of the fasciculi with the veins, proceeding with them until they enter the gland, into which they penetrate before they reach the thoracic duct. It may be presumed, that this system is proportionably as freely dis- tributed to the muscles as to the blood-vessels and nerves, which are so abundant. The nerves of the muscular system are both numerous and large, more especially those nerves which supply the external muscles; while the muscles internally seated receive fewer filaments, and from a different source. Again, there are inter- mediate muscles which receive their nerves from both sources, and have properties peculiar to each class: but this grand divi- sion of the muscular system will be described in detail, after the general attributes of muscle have been treated. Thus the muscles derive their nerves from three sources:â€”the brain, the spinal marrow, and the sympathetic; and from these they proceed as nervous cords accompanying the blood-vessels, more particularly the arteries; they form frequent plexuses from which several muscles are supplied, probably for the purpose of producing a reciprocal and simultaneous action ; but this will be further investigated when speaking of the properties of the muscular fibre. 'The manner in which the filaments of these nervous cords are distributed to the mus- cles is difficult to comprehend, from the extreme minuteness of their division, which has led to a variety of opinions on the subject. It is considered by some, that they subdivide into as many filaments as there are fibres of the muscles to which they are distributed; so that each ultimate fibre receives an artery and a filament of the nerve, and sends off from it a vein and an absorbent: others are of opinion, that the nerves

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 172 opening" of the chest during inspiration; and still further by the form of the articulations, and distribution of the liga- ments of the first rib, which admit of this particular motion, and differ from the articulations of the other ribs. Respiration is performed by the action of two sets of muscles—those of inspiration and those of expiration. The muscles of inspiration, are the intercostales, levatores costarum, diaphragma, sterno cleido mastoidei, scaleni, serrati postici superiores, serrati magni, subclavii, pectorales, latissimi dorsi, aseendentes cervicales, and the accessorii ad sacro lumbales. The muscles of expiration, are the triangulares sterni, all the abdominal muscles, serrati postici inferiores, longissimi dorsi, sacro lumbales, quadrati lumborum; assisted by the cartilages of the ribs. But under ordinary circumstances, these muscles of in- , piration and expiration are not all called into action ; hence they have been divided into the muscles of ordinary, forced, and violent respiration. Muscles of Inspiration. Ordinary.—Diaphragma. Forced.—Intercostales, and levatores costarum. Violent.—Sterno cleido mastoidei, scaleni, serrati postici superiores, serrati magni, subclavii, pectorales, latissimi dorsi, cervicales aseendentes, and accessorii ad sacro lura- bales. Muscles of Expiration. Ordinary.—^The relaxation of the diaphragm, and the cartilages of ribs. Forced—Abdominal muscles. Violent.—Triangulares sterni, serrati postici inferiores, longissimi dorsi, sacro lumbales, quadrati lumborum. Practical Remarks. Superficial wounds of the chest do not differ from superficial wounds of other parts of the body, excepting from its constant motion, whicli endangers a greater degree of inflammation and liability to the form-

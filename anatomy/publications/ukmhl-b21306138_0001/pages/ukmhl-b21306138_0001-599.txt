DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 213 intermuscular ligament; at the lower part it is placed between the extensor longus pollicis, and peroneus brevis ; its posterior surface is in contact with the fibula, and in- terosseous ligament. Use.—To extend the phalanges of the lesser toes; but that portion of the muscle which is termed the peroneus tertius, being inserted into the metatarsus, is a flexor of the ancle-joint; in which function the common extensor of the toes can assist. The m. extensor proprius pollicis pedis—arises tendinous and fleshy from the fore part of the two inferior thirds of the fibula, between its anterior and internal angles, within an inch of the ancle-joint; also from the lower part of the interosseous ligament, and some few fibres from the edge of the inferior extremity of the tibia; from these origins, the fibres pass obliquely forwards and downwards, terminat- ing in a tendon, which passes under the annular ligament, runs along the inner side of the foot, and passes to be in- serted by separate tendons into the two phalanges of the great toe. This muscle is situated between the tibialis anticus and extensor digitorum communis, and is concealed by them at its origin and middle portion; its tendon then becomes superficial, being covered only by the fascia of the leg*. The anterior tibial vessels and nerve lie between this muscle and the tibialis anticus, above the annular ligament; but below, between it and the inner tendon of the extensor digi- torum communis. Use.—To extend the phalanges of the great toe, and to assist in the flexion of the ancle-joint. The muscles situated on the outer side of the leg, are the peroneus longus and brevis. The m. peroneus longus—arises tendinous and fleshy from the outer and fore part of the head of the fibula, and outer side of the head of the tibia ; from the external angle of the fibula, two thirds down its length, from the anterior surface of that bone, from the posterior surface of the fascia of the leg*, and from the intermuscular tendon, which is anteriorly, com-

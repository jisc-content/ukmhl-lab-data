00 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, When the intestine is strang’ulated in femoral hernia, an operation must be performed to relieve it. The first incision through the integ-uments is made in the form of a reversed ; the ang-les of the integ-ument being- then dis- sected upwards, the fascia superficialis is exposed; this fascia being reflected in the same manner, the fascia propria or fascia transversalis or the anterior layer of the sheath of the vessels comes into view—these three names all meaning the same covering to the hernia, and derive their different appellations from various authors ; but it is to be remembered that it is, under each or all these names, the pubic portion of the fascia transversalis passing down from the abdomen on to the thigh. This being removed, the hernial sac presents itself; or, very frequently, a considerable quantity of fat covers it, and which may lead to some difficulty unless the surgeon is aware of the frequency of the existence of fat in that situ- ation. The sac should now be most carefully opened, and more than usual precaution is required; first, because in a femoral hernia but a very small quantity if any fluid is found in the sac; and, secondly, because the protruded part is fre- quently a portion of intestine only, without omentum. The seat of stricture is now the object of the surgeon’s attention; and, indeed, much variety of opinion exists as to this im- portant subject:—some surgeons being of the opinion, that Gimbernat’s ligament is the cause of strangulation; others, that it is Poupart’s ligament; while Sir Astley’Cooper con- tends it is at the neck of the sac, at the crural ring, where the constriction exists; and that the division of the fascia propria in a direction upwards and slightly inw'ards, will im- mediately liberate the intestine and divide the stricture. My experience would certainly lead me to the conlusion, that the division of Gimbernat’s and Poupart’s ligaments w'ould never liberate a femoral hernia, unless t^-e fascia propria was divided at the crural ring in the manner as recommended by Sir Astley Cooper. There are varieties with respect to the origin of the ob- turator artery which complicate the division of the stricture

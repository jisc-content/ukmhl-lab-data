22 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM, bone, but appertains to all such bones as admit of the play of the temporal muscles over them. Ihe ethmoidal and sphenoidal sutures form the roug’h circumferences of the bones whose name they bear, and connect them with the other bones of the head. The transverse suture connects the os frontis with the bones of the face, and will be more particularly pointed out,—as will the other, sutures,—in the description of the union of the several bones of the face. Having" now taken a collective view of the bones of the skull, as far as refers to their junction, we shall proceed to their individual description. The Os Frontis Has its name from its alone forming" that portion of the head we call the forehead. It has some resemblance to the cockle-shell when separated from the other bones: it is convex externally, and concave internally: smooth above, where it forms the forehead, but below, where it assists in forming" the orbits, it affords several processes and eminences: the inner and concave surface is turned towards the brain. The processes and depressions which may be remarked on the external surface are, first, two frontal eminences, which mark the centres off ossification; two frontal tuberosities, marking" tlie situation of the frontal sinuses; and two super- ciliary ridges, which overarch the orbit, g-ive attachment to the occipito-frontalis muscle, and have the eye-brow placed on them: they terminate externally and internally in an exter- nal and internal angular process. Betwixt the two internal ang"ular processes, a small process arises named the nasal process. Behind the external ang"ular processes, a flat sur- face is observed, denominated the temporal fossa, on which the temporal muscle plays. From the under part of the supercihary ridg"es, poitions of bone run a considerable way backwards: they are concave below to receive the ball of the eye, and termed therefore the orbitar processes.

BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 127 The bones of the carpus present such peculiarities, as to render it necessary to g’ive to each a separate description; and, according- to the usual plan, I shall begin witli the sca- phoid bone, which is placed on the radial side of tlie cubital row of the carpus. Cubital Roto. Os Scaphoides. Tliis bone is so named from its resemblance to a boat, and is articulated, above, with the radius; below, with the mag- num ; on the outer side, with the trapezium and trapezoid; and on its inner side, with the lunar bone. It therefore pre- sents five articulatory surfaces. The upper surface is convex from within to without, and from before to behind, corre- sponding to the outer concave articular surface, on the inferior extremity of the radius. The lower concave surface has its long axis from side to side, for the purpose of receiving a part of the rounded head of the os magnum, on the inner side of which is a crescentic, flattened, articular surface for the lunar bone. The outer articular surface is placed obliquely, facing out- wards and downwards ; is divided by an indistinct ridge, to be connected with the trapezium and trapezoid bones. The posterior, or dorsal surface of this bone, is marked by a deep groove, having a direction from within to without, which gives attachment to ligament. The anterior, or palmar surface, is also rough for the in- sertion of ligament; and being less expanded than the poste- rior, assists in forming the carpal arch. Use.—This bone enters into the composition of-the wrist-joint, above, and the articulation, between the two i-ows of the carpus, below. The scaphoid bone does not give attachment to any muscle. Os Lunare. The os lunare has received its name from its crescentic form, and presents, like the scaphoid bone, an upper rounded

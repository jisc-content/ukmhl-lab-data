20 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. brain, with some few grooves for lodging the blood-vessels of the brain and its membranes. It is worthy of remark, that the exterior table of the bones of the skull does not offer eminences corresponding to the internal depressions, in consequence of an intervening can- cellated structure, but which however is diminished in those situations in proportion to the depth of the internal depres- sionsâ€”an observation pathologically valuable in reference to the application of the trephine. In the base of the skull many outlets are found, termed foramina, allowing the transmission of nerves and blood- vessels. It has already been observed, that the bones of the skull are composed of two laminae, with an intervening cancel- lated structure called the diploe; but it should further be noticed, that the .external table is thick and fibrous, and the internal compact and thin : which circumstances tend to ren- der the bones a better defence to the brain, upon principles which will be explained hereafter. The cranium consists of eight bones; six of which are usually described as proper to its cavity, and two common to it and the face: but, upon consideration, it is difficult to understand the legitimacy of tins division ; for, in truth, the reverse seems to be the fact, viz.: that only two, the parietal bones, can strictly be described as proper to the cranium, and the remaining six as common to the head and face. The eight bones which enter into the composition of the cranium, are the os frontis, which occupies tlie anterior part of the skull; the two ossa parietalia, which form the upper lateral portions and vertex; the os occipitis, which is situ- ated behind and at the base ; tlie two ossa temporum, form- ing the inferior lateral portions and part of the base of the cranium. The os ethmoides occupies the fore part of the base, which is completed by the os sphenoides, situated in the centre of the base. It may moreover be observed, that the frontal, occipital, ethmoid and sphenoid are azygos bones, and are placed in

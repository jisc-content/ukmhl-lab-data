DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 21 I the fibrous theca, is ultimately inserted into the under and posterior surface of the last phalanx of the g’reat toe. The posterior surface of this muscle is covered by the deep fascia of the leg"; the anterior surface lies upon the fibula and tibialis posticus; it lies between the peroneus long-us on its outer side, and the tibialis anticus on its inner : its tendon is furnished with synovial membranes behind the inner malleolus, and on the g'reat toe ; in the space between the two, its tendon is enveloped by the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis. Use.—To bend the second upon the first phalanx, and the toe upon the metacarpal bone ; it also extends the foot, and increases its longi- tudinal arch. We next proceed to the muscles situated between the tibia and fibula in front, which consist of the tibialis anticus, extensor longus digitorum, and extensor longus pollicis muscles; which receive a covering from the fascia of the leg. The m. tibialis anticus—arises fleshy from the outer and fore part of the tibia, immediately below its head, and also from the head of the fibula ; in the intermediate space, between the two, its fibres are connected with the tibialis posticus, through the interosseous opening. Its origin extends two thirds down the anterior angle, or spine of the tibia, and inner half of the interosseous ligament, as well as from the posterior surface of the fascia of the leg ; its fibres descend obliquely outwards, and terminate in a strong flat tendon, which passes from the outer to the anterior surface of the tibia, runs underneath the annular ligament, and gains the dorsum of the foot; here the tendon becomes broader, passes on the inner side of the tendons of the extensor longus digitorum, to be inserted into the upper and inner part of the os cu- neiforme internum, and root of the metatarsal bone sup- porting the great toe. This muscle is superficially situated; at its origin it is placed on the outer side of the tibia, but lower down becomes anterior to it; it has before it the fascia of the leg, behind

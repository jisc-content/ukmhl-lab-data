DESCRimVli ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 47 the pelvis and lower extremities towards the thorax ; they also render the fascia lata of the thigh tense; and lastly, act as opponents to the sterno cleido inastoidei by depressing the sternum. To expose the second layer of the abdominal muscles, the m: obliquus externus must be separated from its costal and iliac attachments, and its tendon divided a little above Poupart’s ligament, from the anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium to within an inch of the external abdo- minal ring; the whole muscle is then to be reflected towards the linea semilunaris. The obliquus abdominis internus ascendens is thus exposed: in form it resembles the last described muscle, but its fibres pass in a contrary direction: it is more fleshy below than above; it is covered in front by the obliquus externus, poste- riorly by the latissimus dorsi, and lies upon the musculus transversus abdominis. The internal oblique muscle arises posteriorly from a very strong fascia, common to this and other muscles, which is termed the fascia lumborum, and which is formed of three aponeurotic membranes ; the poste- rior layer proceeding from the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae and sacrum ; the middle one, from the apices of the transverse processes; and the anterior and thinnest layer, continuous with the fascia iliaca, passes over the quadrates lumborum, and thus forms sheaths for the lumbar muscles. From the strong posterior layer of this fascia, from the whole length of the mfddle labium of the iUum, and from the outer half of Poupart’s ligament, the internal oblique muscle arises ; from its fascial and posterior iliac origins the fibres are directed obliquely forward and upwards to the thorax; from the anterior part of the ilium they take a transverse course to the median line, and from Poupart’s ligament they incline obliquely downwards and inwards towards the pubes, presenting below a free and slightly concave edge. The obliquus abdominis internus is inserted tendinous into the cartilage ensiformis; tendinous and fleshy into the edges of the cartilages of the six inferior ribs. At the linea semilunaris this muscle becomes wholly

187 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. and tuberosity of the ischium, where it is connected with the sacro sciatic ligaments; from these origins it proceeds downwards upon the posterior part of the thigh, giving a covering* to the muscles of this region ; its edges are firmly attached throughout the whole length of the linea aspcra, thus forming the posterior fascial bag: it is then continued to the heads of the tibia and fibula, where it is lost in the fascia of the leg*. Anteriorly, the fascia lata arises from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, from the whole length of Poupart’s ligament, from the pubes, Gimbernat’s ligament, and linea ilio pectinea ; from these origins it proceeds downwards, gives an anterior covering to the muscles of the thigh, and completes the anterior bag by passing to be attached to the whole length of the linea aspera, in common with the posterior bag, continuing down- wards on the fore part of the thigh to the condyles and sides of the patella. Thus the muscles of the anterior region of the thigh, are completely separated from those of the poste- rior region by the intervention of this fascia; which dips internally, between the triceps adductor femoris, and vastus internus; externally, between the vastus externus and glu- taeus maximus above, and vastus externus and short head of the biceps below. Besides these attachments'of the fascia, it is right to men- tion, that it is thicker and stronger on the outer than on the inner part of the thigh ; and that in several situations it splits to give a perfect envelopment to some of tlie muscles; particularly to the gluteus maximus, tensor vaginae femoris which is inserted into it, and the sartorius. The crescentic opening on the anterior part of this fascia, and other peculiarities of its anterior origins, have been already given when speaking of the parts connected with hernia. Between this fascia and the common integuments, there is a dense cellular membrane, which is called the fascia super- ficialis ; it forms a covering to femoral hernia, and has also been before described.

ANATOMY OF HAIRS. 305 days; many such instances were witnessed during- the French revolution, although we are not able to account for this change. The hair is said to undergo a morbid change in its se- cretion, and that in the disease named plica polonica, when cut near to the skin, blood will exude from the cut extre- mitiesâ€™; this accumulating, the hairs will be all matted toge- ther : but it is probable, that the mere filth of the Poles, among whom this disease is most common, is the sole cause, as its cure has been effected, simply by cutting off the hair. Certain fatty tumours have been found to contain hair, mixed with the sebaceous matter; again, they have been found in ovarian cists; in such cases, they are, however, connected with accidental cutaneous formations. After fevers, it win frequently come off in abundance ; nevertheless, like cuticle, it will form again readily, particularly in young persons. Inveterate headaches have been cured by frequent cutting of the hair; which may probably act like a blister, by calling a new action to the part, as the more frequently hair is cut, the faster it will grow.

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 39 the imiselcs attached to the bones of the chest subservient at once to the act of respiration, to the expulsion of the fajces, and to the motions of the body upon the pelvis ; whilst innumerable instances, equally striking-, might be adduced to illustrate the same principle. Even physiologically, there- fore, such an arrangement as that I have just alluded to, would prove extremely inconvenient and imperfect; whilst, to the student engaged in actual dissection, it would not only be perfectly useless, but tend to mislead and complicate his study. Another plan, perhaps better calculated to assist the pupil in acquiring- and retaining a knowledge of the muscular system, is, to specify numerically the whole of the muscles of a particular part or region of the body, with a corres- ponding numerical subdivision, according either to their origins and insertions, or to their individual and combined uses. Such a plan has long appeared to me to be of the greatest use in teaching anatomy; and, indeed, I may con- scientiously say, that the advantages in its adoption in my lectures, have been felt and frequently acknowledged by those most interested in the result. An objection, nevertheless, immediately presents itself to such a plan, in its inapplicability to the purposes of practical anatomy; for, to the dissector, the principal object is, to be prepared to recognize the various parts and structure brought into view as he proceeds in his dissection : an object, indeed, altogether indispensible. Such a plan, accordingly, has been occasionally adopted: the various parts, layer after layer, being described as they presented themselves in the progress of dissection ; but it is a plan which is not very easy or very scientific to adhere strictly to, either in lecturing or in an elementary treatise, without producing great confusion and embarrassment, inasmuch as both the proper and compound action, as well as the individual uses of muscles, must yield to mere mechanical position. Finding, therefore, all these plans themselves more or less imperfect, it will be my endea- vour so to avail myself of, and combine the advantages of

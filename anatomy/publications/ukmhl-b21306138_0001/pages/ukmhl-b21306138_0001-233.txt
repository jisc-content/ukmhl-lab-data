BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 171 much in different skulls, there is no evidence of the brain being' injured until symptoms supervene; and I would therefore recommend that the patient should be most narrowly watched, and that the trephine should not be applied until symptoms point out the necessity. When com- pression occurs from the formation of matter, which, as already men- tioned, does not come on until some time after the accident, the surgeon is placed under the greatest difficulty to discover the precise seat of the injury, as it is not always at the part where the blow was indicted. To ascertain this essential point the scalp must be most care- fully examined, and a puffy appearance may be found opposite to the part where the matter is situated. An incision is to be made through this part and the skull exposed, which will be found denuded, or at any rate its perecranium easily separable from it; the bone itself will be of an ash colour, without any tendency to bleed. These circumstances will prove that you are justified in removing this portion of bone. I have seen my colleague and relative, Mr. Key, under these circumstance, perform this operation with perfect success as far as refers to the evac- uation of the matter, although the patient did not subsequently recover, in consequence of the extent of injury the brain had sustained. The fractures of the bones of the pelvis, need no further account than has already been given with the description of the individual bones.

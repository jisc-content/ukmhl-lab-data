DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 221 The m. adductor minimi digiti—arises from the inner side of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, and base of the fourth ; and passes to be inserted into the inner side of the root of the first phalanx of the fifth toe. In a like manner to the two preceding, this muscle adducts the toe to which it is inserted. The tendon of the peroneus long’us, which can only be traced to its insertion in this stag'e of the dissection, has been already described. We next proceed, in the order of dissection, to the mus- cles situated on the dorsum of the foot; these are, the interossei externi, and the flexor brevis digitorum. The m. interossei externi, vel superiores—are four in number, are larger than the internal, arise by two heads, and are sometimes called the Interossei bicipites. The m. adductor digiti secundi—arises from the inner side of the metatarsal bone of the second, and from the outer side of the metatarsal bone of the great toe—the two origins being separated to admit the passage of the anterior tibial artery ; the belly of this muscle passes forward to be inserted into the inner side of the root of the first phalanx of the second toe. Use.—To draw the second towards the great toe. The m. abductor digiti secundi—arises chiefly from the outer side of the metatarsal bone of the second toe, and inner side of the third toe ; and passes to be inserted into the outer side of the first phalanx of the second toe. Use.—To draw the second from the great toe. The m. abductor digiti medii—arises chiefly from the outer side of the metatarsal bone of the middle or third toe, and outer side of the fourth ; and is inserted into the outer side of the base of the first phalanx of the middle or third toe. Use,—To draw the third toe outwards from the second. The m. abductor digiti quarti—arises from the outer side of the fourth, and inner of the fifth metatarsal bone ; and is

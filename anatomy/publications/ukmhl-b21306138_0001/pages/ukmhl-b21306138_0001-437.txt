descriptive anatomy of muscles. 51 pass in front of the rectus muscle ; or, more properly, it may be said, at this point they are lost in cellular membrane: so that the recti muscles at this lower part of the abdomen have nothing intervening themselves and the viscera but the thin fascia transversalis and peritoneum, enabling them more effectually to compress the viscera of the pelvis,—which is one of the principal uses of these muscles,—as well as to bend the trunk forwards, and to raise the pelvis towards the thorax. In the lower part of the sheath of the rectus, on each side of the linea alba, there is frequently found, although not so often in the male as in the female, a muscle, which is named from its form the Musculus pyramidalis; it arises, broad and fleshy, from the superior part of the pubes anterior to the origin > of the rectus, from which it is separated by the aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle; while anteriorly it is bounded by the united tendons of the internal obhque and transversalis muscles, and superior pillar of the external ring: from its origin it passes upwards and inwards to be inserted into the linea alba midway between the pubes and umbilicus. Use.—The use of the pyramidalis is to assist the rectus in compressing the viscera of the pelvis (hence more frequently found in the female than the male), and to render the linea alba tense. Its directions of action are downwards and outwards; it is occasionally found on one side only. These five pairs of abdominal muscles being dissected, the student should consider their collective uses; and he will see how the use of each is common to them all. They all form the parietes of the abdomen: and the direction in which these fibres cross each other, adapt them in the best possible manner, not only to sustain the viscera contained within. the abdomen ; but also at the same time to prevent their protrusion. ‘ They are also by their contractions destined to assist in the function of these viscera. We therefore find an arrangement, that their force may be equally applied through every part of the abdomen ; and to effect this, it

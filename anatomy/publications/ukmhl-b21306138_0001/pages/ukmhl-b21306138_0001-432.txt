4t) DESCRIPl'IVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. luiving" its upper and outer angle strengthened by cross tendinous fibres. This opening is of a triangular form, di- rected obliquely downwards and inwards, and is broader above than below; it is for the purpose of giving passage to the spermatic cord and cremaster muscle in the male, and to the round ligament of the uterus in the female. This space, however, is not to be considered as being left open as a communication between the outer aud inner parts, being- closed within by the tendons of the obliquus internus and transversalis muscles, and externally by the fascia of the cord and the fascia superficialis ; it is, however, through this space that the bowels protrude in inguinal hernia. Several openings are to be .observed in the aponeurotic portion of the oblil^uus externus, besides those already mentioned, which are for the passage of the ramifications of blood-vessels and nerves, and which sometimes permit the protrusion of the abdominal viscera, producing what is termed ventral hernia. The fleshy fibres of this muscle vary, both in their length and direction, in diflFerent parts of its extent; its upper fibres are short, and nearly vertical; the middle are the longest, and descend from without to within; while the posterior fibres are thick, short, and pass nearly vertically from the last ribs to the ilium : so that the result of the action of this muscle depends upon a direction given to the moveable parts in a line intermediate to the combined forces of its collective fibres. Use.â€”The obliquus abdominis externus descendens contracts the capacity of the abdomen, consequently compresses the viscera of that cavity, and assists therefore in the passage of their contents; it also acts violently in vomiting, and assists in the expulsion of tlie foetus. It depresses the ribs, diminishes therefore the capacity of the chest, and acts in expiration, in coughing, sneezing, laughing, &c,; and by press- ing the viscera against the diaphragm, is indirectly producing hiccough. When acting singly, they incline the thorax obliquely downwards to the opposite side of that muscle which is in action ; and when they both act, the thorax is drawn directly forwards and downwards towards the pelvis. In the recumbent posture, and in climbing, these muscles raise

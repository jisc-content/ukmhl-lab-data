DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 167 obliquely downwards and forwards,—those of the upper in- tercostal spaces being- less oblique than those of the lower, and are also more oblique posteriorly than anteriorly; they are inserted into the upper obtuse edg-e of each inferior rib by short aponeurotic fibres, intimately connected with the periosteum as far as the cartilag-es of the ribs. The small fleshy bundles which arise from tlie transverse processes, are inserted partly into the rib connected with that vertebra, and partly into the next rib below; these are described as the levatores costarum breviores et longiores, and may be seen in the dissection of the muscles of the seventh layer of the back; but they are, in fact, merely the commencement of the intercostales externi. These muscles are covered posteriorly by the serrati postici, long-issimi dorsi, and sacro lumbales ; anteriorly and above, by the pectorales; below, by the abdominal muscles ; and in the middle, by the serrati mag-ni: their internal surfaces are in contact with the pleura, from the tubercles of the ribs to their angles ; and anterior to this they lie upon the internal intercostal muscles and vessels. The m. intercostales interni—are twelve in number, and pass from before to behind, but with less obliquity than the external intercostal muscles. They arise from the lower edge of the cartilages of the ribs, commencing at their connection with the sternum, from the inferior edge of the body of each superior rib, extending as far as the angle, and pass downwards to be inserted into the upper edge of each inferior rib and cartilage. From the seventh to the eleventh rib, at about their centre, slips of the internal inter- costal muscles, instead of being inserted into the rib imme- diately below, pass over it to be inserted into the second rib below ; these muscles have received the name of depressoi'es costarum, which evidently is an error; as, from the direction of their fibres, they cannot have a different action from the remaining portions of the internal intercostals. The intercostal muscles decussate, forming a double layer in the centre of the ribs ; and a single layer only from M 2

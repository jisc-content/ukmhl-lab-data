bones of the head. 35 mon to the temporal and occipital bones. Its use is to transmit a small vein from the exterior of the cranium to the lateral sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital artery passes through it to supply the posterior surface of the dura mater. The internal surface of the ossa temporum is very unequal, but, like the external, is divided into a squamous and a petrous portion. The squamous portion is irregularly concave, rises upwards, and terminates in a thin semilunar edge, which is serrated for its firmer attachment to the parietal bones which it overlaps, producing that kind of scaly attachment from which this portion of the bone has derived its name. Imme- diately below the scaly serrated edges, the bone is marked by the convolutions of the lateral lobes of the brain, and is furrowed by the arteries of the dura mater. The petrous portion on its internal surface is of a triangular form, and is directed forwards and inwards, presenting an anterior surface, a posterior surface, an acute upper edge, and a broad surface below, which is irregular, and has been described as forming a part of the exterior of the bone: the base of the triangle is attached to the squamous portion of the temporal bone, and the apex extends to the sphenoid, where that bone is joined to the cuneiform process of the occipital. On the anterior face there are irregular depres- sions to receive the middle lobes of the brain ; there is also a slight depression for the semilunar ganghon of the trige- minal or fifth pair of nerves. At the anterior and internal extremity of this face, the carotid canal may be seen opening into the cavity of the cranium by the side of the sphenoid bone; and on the outer side of this, at the junction of the petrous and squamous portions of the bone, the eustachian canal is placed, which has already been described: leading from it, and directed upwards and outwards, passes a groove to the foramen innominatum, for the passage and transmis- sion of a reflected branch from the second division of the fifth pair of nerves. On the posterior surface may be seen the foramen auditivum internum, which allows the transmission

GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 21 second, the intestines and the stomach; third, the muscles of the urinary org-ans ; fourth, the pulmonary ventricles; fifth, the oesophagus; sixth, the iris ; and seventh, the ex- ternal muscles. The same order of succession takes place •when the muscles are detached from the body. From what has been said of the inherent contractibility of muscle, it is evident that their use must be either to move the body from place to place, or to change the form and ^ alter the capacity of certain parts of the body, according to the several functions of those parts. This leads us to distinguish into two principal classes the various combina- tions of the muscular fibre. Muscles generally may be called the active agents of locomotion, as we are in the habit of terming the skeleton the passive agent; but the alteration in the form and capacity of certain parts of the body, acted upon by the muscular contraction, may be either under the control of the will, or wholly independent of the direction of volition; and therefore we are in the habit of dividing the muscles, according to their uses, into voluntary and involuntary. The former class comprehends all the muscles which are attached to the extremities, and to such parts as are moved by the influence of the will, and are said therefore to belong to animal life ,• while the invo- luntary muscles, which are stimulated to action by dis- tention from their natural contents, and which -form the parietes of hollow organs generally contained within one of these great cavities, maintain functions, the constant per- formance of which are essential to existence; and hence they are said to be the vital organs: such muscles, there- fore, we find influencing the circulation of the blood, and • the functions of the stomach and bowels. The action of these muscles seems to depend upon the influence of their peculiar nerves, though not upon the brain; for in brainless monsters the action of the heart and intestines continues the same. But yet it seems that the action of such mus- cles is, at any rate, influenced by the brain, as is proved by the effects of joy, rage and grief upon the organs of c 2

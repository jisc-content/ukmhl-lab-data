LECTURE XVIIL DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. Muscles of the Lower Extremity. The muscles of the lower extremity may be divided into those of the hip-joint, those of the knee, those of the ancle- joint, and those common and proper to the toes. The same principle exists here as in the joints of other parts of the body,—namely, the muscles moving- each joint are inserted into the bones next in connection below. Thus the muscles of the hip-joint are all inserted into the femur; the muscles which move the knee, into the tibia and fibula; the muscles of the ancle, into either the tarsus or metatarsus; and the muscles common and proper to the toes, are inserted into the phalanges. Hence on looking at the insertion of any muscle, the student at once knows the joint and function to which it belongs. The muscles of the hip-joint are fourteen in number ; a*nd although several of them combine in the performance of various actions, still however they may be classed as three flexors, three extensors and abductors, six rotators outwards, one rotator inwards, and one adductor. These muscles are covered by a strong fascia, which it is necessary first to describe. The fascia lata.—The anterior portion of this fascia has already been spoken of, in connection with the anatomy of femoral hernia; but independent of its origin as described from Poupart’s ligament and the os ilium, it also arises, pos- teriorly, from the os sacrum and coccygis, from the posterior part of the crista of the ilium, from the spinous process

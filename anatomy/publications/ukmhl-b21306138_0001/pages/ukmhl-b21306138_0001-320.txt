PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, 258 each other, without fracture, may be considered us almost impossible, although some authors have described cases in which the os magnum has been thrown from the cavity formed for it by the lunar and scaphoid bones upon the back of tbe hand, there forming a considerable tumour. The means to be employed for its reduction are sufficiently obvious; force should be applied upon the dorsal surface of the dislocated bone, while tbe hand is kept in an extended position ; and if these means are early employed, its replacement may be effected without much difficulty. Dislocations of the metacarpus,—From the description which has been given of the formation of tbe articulations and motions of the meta- carpal bones on tbe carpus, and of their connexion with each other, their dislocations must necessarily be of very rare occurrence; for a force sufficient for their displacement, would rather fracture the bones than produce their luxation, unless previous disease had destroyed the natural means of their connexion. Dislocations of the phalanges.—The first phalanges present a concave surface, to receive the convex extremities of the metacarpal bones ; and in consequence of the rounded surfaces of these bones extending much further forwards than backwards, the first phalanx can scarcely be thrown into the palm of the hand, but is forced backwards on the metacarpal bones. This accident most frequently occurs to the thumb, and may be readily known by the deformity on the metacarpus, and by the extension of the first phalange, while the second is bent. The other phalanges are also liable to similar dislocations, which are not easily reduced, particularly if any length of time has elapsed between the accident and the attempt at reduction; for in consequence of the small- ness and shortness of the dislocated phalanx, it becomes very difficult to apply, by any mechanical means, a sufficient force to restore the bone to its natural situation ; which, however, may be eflTected by tbe applica- tion of a piece of tape, fix«d to the extremity of the dislocated phalanx in the form of a “ clove hitch.”

THE 089E0US SYSTEM. 34 mastoid processes, and is consequently called the foramen stylo-mastouleum: it is, in fact, the termination of the canal of Fallopius, and allows of the transmission of the portio dura or facial neiYe. Somewhat anterior, and rather to the inside of the styloid process, is found the third foramen, but which, from its tor- tuous course, is to be considered rather as a canal. It is throug’h this foramen that the internal carotid artery enters the skull, and is termed, therefore, the foramen caroticum. It also admits the filaments of connexion between the sym- pathetic and the fifth and sixth pairs of cerebral nerves : there are small foramina leading" from this passag’e to the internal ear, and, throug-h these, small arteries pass, which have been particularly described by Valsalva as the proper arteries of the tympanum. On the anterior edg’e of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at the very point of junction of this part of the bone with the squamous, and situated immediately above the inner opening" of the carotid foramen, is placed the orifice of a canal which passes backwards and outwards to terminate in the anterior part of the tympanum: in the recent subject, partly composed of cartilag-e and partly ligamentous, it is continued to the pharynx, and is termed the iter a palato ad aurem, or eustachian tube. Immediately above the entrance of the eustachian tube, and separated from it by a thin lamina of bone, is a small canal of minor importance, through which the tendon of the tensor tympani passes into the tympanum. The fifth foramen is the foramen glasseri, which is situated a little above the centre of the fissure of that name, immedi- ately posterior to the capsular ligament of the lower jaw: it allows of the passage of a small nerve which crosses the tympanum, and is termed the chorda tympani: it likewise gives entrance to the tendon of the laxator tympani muscle. There is, however, not unfrequently, another foramen found on the external surface of the temporal bone, just at the posterior rough edge of the petrous portion, which is called the foramen mastoideum: but this foramen is usually com-

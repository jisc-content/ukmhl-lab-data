210 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. splitting’ at its insertion to allow of the passag-e of the flexor tendons of the toes. Besides the division of this fascia, in the anterior part of the sole of the foot at its insertion into the metatarsus, it also separates itself, in the middle of the plantar reg’ion, into three portions : the centre one, which is the thickest, covers the flexor muscles common to the toes; while the lateral more attenuated portions, cover the muscles forming’ the ball of the great and little toe. This fascia being removed, the muscles situated above it are to be dissected ; the description of which may be much facilitated by arranging them in four layers. The first layer is composed of the flexor- brevis digitorum pedis, in the middle ; the abductor pollicis pedis, on the inner; and the abductor minimi digiti pedis, on the outer side. The m. flexor brevis digitorum fed,is perforatus — is a muscle common to the toes; it arises from the Inferior surface, and rather to the inner side of the tuberosity of the calcis, from the upper surface of the fascia plantaris, and the intermuscular tendons, separating this from the abductor pollicis on the inner side, and the abductor minimi digiti on the outer ; from these origins, the muscle passes forwards to the middle of the foot, M'here it divides, sending off* four slender tendons, which diverge as they pass to the second phalanges of the four lesser toes, where they split to allow-' of the transmission of the tendons of the flexor longus diffitorum; and are then inserted into the anterior extre- mities of the second phalanges by tendinous expansion. The under surface of this muscle rests upon the fascia plantaris ; the upper surface is covered by the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, museulus accessorius, and lum- bricales; its inner edge is bounded by the abductor pollicis, with which it is connected posteriorly ; while, anteriorly, it is separated from it by the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis ; its outer edge is bounded by the abductor minimi digiti. The short flexor tendon from this muscle to the little toe, is not unfrequently wanting.

18 GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, the brain, spinal marrow, nerve passing- into a muscle, or to the very muscle itself. Indeed, mechanical stimulants ' sometimes rouse into action a distant set of muscles which seem to have no direct communication ; as a crumb of bread in the g-lottis produces violent contraction of the muscles of expiration. The natural stimuli to the involuntary muscles seem to be of this class, as the flow of blood into the cavities of the heart, and the accumulation of the contents of the viscera produce contraction of their muscles; but this may perhaps be partly attributable to chemical agency. The chemical stimuli, as alcohol, acid, alkalies, &c., pro- duce an immediate action on the muscular system, and more especially on the involuntary muscles; but it is per- haps doubtful, whether they really produce it from chemical or mechanical influence. Galvanism and electricity, which produce no apparent physical change in a muscle, will yet cause its violent contraction; it is diflicult, therefore, to know which class of stimulants to place them with; no change, either mechanical or chemical, can be traced: they have, therefore, by some physiologists been ranked amongst the vital stimuli, considering, perhaps, their effect as more closely allied to the natural im'pulse communicated to the muscular system through the brain and nerves; for the contraction of muscles, produced by high degrees of nervous affections, is very similar to the contractions pro- duced by galvanism or electricity. It is no less true than wonderful that particular muscles, and even particular fibres of the same organ, should be differently affected by different stimuli; thus, certain substances produce the natural action of the stomach and the bowels, while others will produce vomiting and purging; and yet no difference can be perceived in the organization or che- mical properties of the fibres themselves. There seems, how^ever, to be a contractile power in muscle which is inde- pendent of any influence from the nervous system, as indi- cated by the contraction of a paralysed muscle, or the

PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. 202 their composition : but I shall only urge the necessity of bearing in mind the complicated structure of articulations, the peculiar functions they have to perform, and their consequent liability to morbid affections. I may, however, perhaps with advantage recapitulate, that as bone^ car- tilage, synovial membrane and ligaments are all necessary to the formation of a joint, and that as each is susceptible from numerous causes to inflammation and its consequences, that the symptoms pro- duced are as various as the structures, and that a thorough knowledge of them can only be gained by a strict attention to the altered function of the affected articulation. I shall, however, make some few remarks with respect to the wounds of joints ; and what is first to be considered as most important, is the manner in which the wound was inflicted, and the depth to which it has penetrated ; for we find the danger great in proportion to the violence and contusion sustained, and to the depth and extent of the wound, with injury to important parts. When a joint is wounded, the term implies an opening into the synovial cavity, accom- panied frequently with injury to the other structures of the joint, as ligaments, vessels, and even sometimes cartilages and bone. When the synovial cavity is opened, it is generally indicated by a flow of the sy- novia from the wound ; but even this, it is to be remembered, does not always point out the actual nature of the case, as the synovia may es- cape from a bursa mucosa in the vicinity of the injured joint, and not from the articulation itself: hence the necessity of a just anatomical knowledge, by which the surgeon should be enabled to form his judg- ment, without the necessity of the introduction of a probe, which is so liable to excite inflammation, and to cause therefore more mischief than the wound itself. In these cases the treatment is the same, whether in- jury to the synovial capsule be proved or only suspected: namely, that the wound be immediately closed by adhesive plaster, that the joint be placed and maintained in a perfect state of rest, that evaporating lotions be applied, and that the antiphlogistic regimen be strictly enforced; and under such treatment, incised wounds of joints do frequently heal favourably, without any dangerous symptoms; as is seen after the operation for removing loose cartilage from joints; but this, however, is not invariably the case; for in some constitutions of a highly inflam- matory tendency, the injury is followed by violent inflammation of the synovial cavity, leading to suppuration within the joint, and frequently terminating by the destruction of the cartilages, and even disease of the osseous structure itself. These effects are generally accompanied by exces- sive constitutional irritation, which often rapidly carries off the patient; or, should his strength of constitution enable him to overcome the conse- quences of theinjury,ananchylosed joint is generally the result. As may naturally be expected, the danger attendant upon wounded joints depends

tiO DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. US well as to the local appearances, to which, however, careful investigation will generally facilitate the means of forming a just diagnosis ; and, more especially, as to the precise point where the swelling commenced, which, in oblique inguinal hernia, is invariably at the internal ring, so that the tumour is felt midway between the spinous process of the ilium and pubes, immediately it protrudes ; while, on the contrary, hydrocele, diseases of the testicle, &c., com- mence from the lower part of the scrotum. There is yet another species of inguinal hernia, and which differs essentially from the oblique, from not passing through the internal ring, and from being placed on. the inner side of the epigastric artery; on wliich account, it is sometimes called internal inguinal hernia ; or ventro inguinal, from passing directly from the cavity of the abdomen through the external ring ; but, more frequently, direct inguinal hernia, in contradistinction to the oblique, from passing perfectly straight from the abdomen, and not taking the course of the cord. If the tumour in this hernia be large, it is difficult to tell'it from an oblique hernia; for the intestine meeting with least resistance outwards, the tumour appears to take an oblique direction; but should the intestine become strangulated, so as to render an operation necessary, one of the coverings peculiar to this rupture at once points out the nature of the disease. This covering is the tendon formed by the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, which passes behind the external ring to be inserted into the pubes, and is necessarily protruded with the intestine, as well as the portion of the fascia transversalis, which is connected with it. This is the only hernia which protrudes with a tendinous covering through the external ring; and therefore, when this structure is found, the nature of the disease is at once known; and the division of the stricture, as in the preceding’ species of hernia, may be made directly upwards; thus avoiding‘the epigastric artery, which is on the outer side of the neck of the sac. Femoral, or crural hernia, is distinctly different from

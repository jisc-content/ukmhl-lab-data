190 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. tissue, in other parts of tlie body; for in tliese situations they are covered by a membrane termed perichondrium, which may be considered as forming" the fibrous portion of their structure, and enclosing" the cartilag"inous tissue; and further, by boiling", they do not yield so much gelatine as other fibro- cartilages. The second class, or articular fibro-cartilages, are found in two kinds of joints; in the one they are found free, not being connected with articular cartilages, but separated from the bones of the articulation to which they belong by the synovial membrane, which these fibro-cartilaginous bodies divide into two perfect sacs; these are found in such situations, where they are much exposed to violent motion. The other kind are fixed in a solid manner to the bones themselves, as in the vertebrae; and admit of the motion of these bones upon each other, from the physical properties they possess of flexibility and elasticity: they are alike, however, in being firm, re- sisting, dense, and intricately interwoven, so as powerfully to resist injury. This is exemplified by the strength with which the vertebrae are attached, and by the difficulty of breaking or otherwise destroying the interarticular structures of the jaw and clavicle ; and also by the resistance which they op- pose to luxations. The third class, which have been described for the purpose of facilitating the motion of tendon, seem to proceed from the periosteum, which probably furnishes its fibrous struc- ture, while the bone itself supplies the interstices of this ligamentous tissue with cartilage, and thus forms the fibro- cartilages which enter into the composition of tendinous sheaths. The following observations will exemplify the use of this tissue in its three different situations : in the ear, nose, and traehsea, &c., it affords a structure capable of assuming that determined form best adapted to the functions of the organ to which it belongs, while at the same time this form is ca- pable of change horn the influence of muscles, while its elas- ticity allows it spontaneously to reassume its orig inal character.

58 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, director most cautiously, a slig-ht incision is to be made throug-h the fibres of the transversalis muscle and fascia, in a direction vertically upwards ; avoidingâ€™ the epigastric artery, which is placed just to the inner side of the stricture. The contents of the' sac should now be examined with a delicate manipulation, and be returned into the abdomen, or left in the sac, according to circumstances belonging more to the consideration of a surgical than an anatomical writer, and to whom, therefore, I must refer my readers. The second kind of inguinal hernia is also termed oblique; but besides taking the same course in the direction of the cord, as the last described, passes through the external abdominal ring into the scrotum, and is termed scrotal her- nia, or oscheocele. In the first part of its course, that is to say, while within the inguinal canal, it is precisely in everj^ anatomical consideration the same as the bubonocele ; but immediately that it passes through the external abdominal ring, it becomes altered in form as well as acquiring another texture for a covering; but this is not an additional covering, for it loses the tendon of the external oblique muscle, and gains as a substitute the cremaster muscle. This hernia, as it descends into the scrotum, continues in front of the sper- matic cord, and descends in old hernise as low as to the point where the tunica vaginalis testis is reflected from the gland. The tumour is of a pyramidal figure, having the apex situated at the ring; but this apex does not, as it appears, terminate at the external ring, but, as a narrow neck, proceeds upwards and outwards along' the inguinal canal to the internal ring; at which point, when this hernia becomes strangulated, the stricture is situated. The steps in the operation to relieve this species of hernia, are the same as those in the preceding kind, excepting that the tendon of the external oblique muscle has not to be divided, in consequence of the tumour having passed through the external abdominal ring; but still it is to be recollected, that there are the same number of coverings to separate, or, I might almost with propriety use the phrase, to peel off

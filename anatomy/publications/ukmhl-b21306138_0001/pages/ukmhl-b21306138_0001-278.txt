PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, â€¢216 tata, are first, the transverse lig-ament, which is proper to the atlas ; and secondly, the lig-aments of the articular processes, which are common to all the vertebrae, I'he transverse ligament arises from a roug'h tubercle on the inner side of the articular process of the atlas; then forming- an arch, which encloses the odontoid process of the second cervical vertebra, by passing- behind it, is directed transversely, to be inserted into the inner side of the opposite articular process. The middle fibres which are in contact with the dentiform process, are the strong-est; and from this part two appendices issue; one placed superiorly and the other inferiorly; the superior one, passing- along- the odontoid process, is lost just above its apex in the fibres of the com- mon posterior ligament of the vertebrae; the inferior appendix arises from the inferior edge of the transverse ligament, passes downward in connexion with the lower part of the odontoid process, and is also imperceptibly lost amid the fibres of the common posterior vertebral ligament. The transverse liga- ment, together with the appendices, form a cross; between the anterior part of which, and the odontoid process, is a synovial membrane, which is sufficiently loose, to allow of free rotatory motion between the first and second cervical ver- tebrae, There is also a synovial membrane covering the car- tilaginous surfaces, upon the forepart of the odontoid process and arch of the atlas. The capsular ligaments connecting the articular surfaces of these bones need no further description, as they have al- ready been mentioned amongst those common to the vertebrae. Motions of the Spine. With respect to this function of the spine, there are three ways in which it may be considered. First, its general mo- bility as a whole; secondly, the peculiar motions of each region; and thirdly, the mobility which exists between any two particular vertebrae.

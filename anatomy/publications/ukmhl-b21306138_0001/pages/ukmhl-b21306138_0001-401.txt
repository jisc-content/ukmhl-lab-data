GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 15 that less IS allowed to pass into their substance . and it this be proved, it would also be an arg'ument for the diminution of bulk in musele duringâ€™ its activity. There are, however, some reasons for doubting' that the quantity of blood in muscle is diminished during its contraction; for the expe- riment which the physiologists who are of that opinion have taken to prove it, cannot be considered as conclusive: they have examined the heart of a frog, which they describe as becoming pale during contraction; but this appearance is owing to the transparency of the ventricles, transmitting therefore a deeper red at the time they are full of blood, which has no bearing upon the question before us. During the contraction of muscle, little or no sensation is produced in the contracting part, but only in the part pressed; this is prGved by clenching the fingers, when the palm of the hand is felt, but no sensation along the muscles of the fingers: indeed it has been believed, that muscle has no sensation during its active state of contraction 5 and it has been alleged from the experiment, to which many people voluntarily subject themselves, of pushing pins into the calves of the legs; yet a long continued forcible action is itself a very painful sensation, as every pupil taking lessons in dancing and fencing will readily acknowledge. While a muscle is contracting, there is said to be a continual agitation of its fibres, which has already been described as being produced by the alternate relaxation and contraction of them ; and it is also said, that by ex- amining a muscle while in action through a stethoscope, a noise may be heard; and if the little finger be pressed into the meatus auditorius, the same noise is heard, which Dr. Woollaston attributed to the motion of the muscular fibres of the arm; but some philosophers have considered it to be produced by the flow of blood through the vessels, which seems to be most probable, as the noise, if attended to, will be found to be syncronous with the pulse. The quickness with which muscular contraction is effected is very considcra.blc, and can but excite wonder when we

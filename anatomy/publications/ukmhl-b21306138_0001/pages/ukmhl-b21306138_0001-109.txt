BONES OF THE HEAD. 05 trunk by soft parts. The os hyoides is divided into its body, cornua, and appendices; all of which are moveable upon one another until advanced periods of life. The body is the central and largest part of the bone, marked upon its external surface by the numerous attachments of muscles, connecting it, above, with the lower jaw and the tongue; below, with the larynx and trunk; posteriorly it is concave ; and, through the medium of membrane and fat, it is connected with the epiglottis. Tlie cornua are connected with the extremities of the body, and pass backwards and slightly upwards towards the styloid processes of the temporal bones, to which they are joined by ligament; superiorly, they are connected with the tongue by the hyoglossi muscles; and, inferiorly, by the broad and round ligaments, with the superior cornua and upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. The appendices are two little projections of bone, which pass upwards and outwards from the junction of the base with the cornua, and assist in giving attachment to some of the muscles connecting this bone with the tongue and jaw. Muscles attached to the os hyoides, above, are the m. digastric!, mylo- hyoidei, genio-hyoidei, genio-hyoglossi, hyo-glossi, and stylo-glossi: below, sterno-hyoidei, omo-hyoidei, thyro-hyoidei: laterally, the con- strictor pharyngis ruedius. Use.—This bone, under different circumstances, forms a fixed point for the action of muscles of the tongue, jaw, larynx, and pharynx. Practical Remarks. The extent of motion of this bone renders it but little liable to frac- ture. Where the throat has been cut, the prognosis is more favourable (cceteris paribus^ when the incision is above than when it is below'this bone. It should be remembered that the cornua are situated between two important arteries,—the lingual above, and the superior thyroideal below. F

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOJUY OF MUSCLES. l'J5 tion with the tendon of the obturator internus ; it arises from the back and outer part of the tuberosity of the ischium, and from the posterior sacro ischiatic ligament; its fibres pass outwards, and form a tendon, which may indeed be considered as common to the three last described mus- cles ; and is inserted into the digital fossa, on the inner side of the trochanter major. The gemini, and the tendon of the obturator internus muscles, are covered by the glutseus maximus, sciatic nerve, and vessels; they are placed between the pyriformis above them, and the quadratus femoris and obturator externus, which, in this view, is concealed, by that muscle, below them. Use.—The.se three muscles act together in rotating the thigh out- wards ; and by being connected with the capsular ligament of the hip- joint, serve to strengthen the articulation, and to prevent the ligament from being pressed between the bones during motion. The m. quadratus femoris—is situated immediately belo w the geminus inferior, extending transversely between the ischium and trochanter; it arises from the outer side of the tuberosity of the ischium; its fibres are directed outwards to be inserted into a rough line passing from the low'er and back part of the great trochanter to the trochanter minor; and which is termed, in consequence of its receiving the insertion of this muscle, the linea quadrata. This muscle is covered posteriorly by the glutseus maximus, ischiatic nerve, and vessels ; it covers the obturator externus; its origin is anterior to the origins of the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps ; and its insertion partly covers the tendons of the psoas and iliacus, where they are inserted into the trochanter minor; above, it is bounded by the geminus inferior, and below, by the upper free edge of the adductor magnus, internal circumflex, and branches of the obturator artery. Use,—To rotate the thigh outwards, and to adduct it. , The next muscle to be dissected, according to the classifi-

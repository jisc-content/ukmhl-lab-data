9 I’HYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES. General Physiology and Production of Bones. Altliough the frequent attcrxipts of the ablest physiologists have failed to explain the ultimate cause of ossification, and although nothing beyond mere hypothesis has hitherto been advanced on the subject, yet are we able to observe and de- scribe the changes which succeed each other, before the bones appear in the human subject in their perfect hardness. Those parts of the foetus destined to constitute the osseous system, are found to undergo three distinct changes: from being originally in a fluid state, they change into a gelatinous consistency, secondly into a cartilaginous form, and thirdly, into a bony substance. The process of ossification then commences, proceeds,and is completed in the following manner:—The first disposition of ossifie matter is observed to take place in the substance of the original cartilage, but not on its surface ; that portion of the cartilage immediately in contact with the osseous points becomes vascular, and, consequently, of a red colour. The osseous points, thus formed, gradually extend them- selves from the centre to without,—the cartilag’e diminishing in a corresponding ratio, until at length it entirely disappears. The cartilage, then, is found to be absorbed as the bony struc- ture is deposited: hence, ossification cannot, in strict propriety, be said to be effected by a deposition of an earthy matter into ' the previously formed cartilage, but, on the contrary, that the ossifie process consists of an entirely new formation—a formation of a structure composed of an animal and earthy matter. Shortly after conception, the whole of the■ bony system forms a transparent mucous mass, which is not converted into the cartilaginous state until two months of uterine gestation ; at least, not in such bones as are late in their formation: some, however, which tire essential to existence, immediately after birth pass through the changes alluded to, at a much earlier period, and with singular rapidity:—of this kind are the ribs and vertebral.

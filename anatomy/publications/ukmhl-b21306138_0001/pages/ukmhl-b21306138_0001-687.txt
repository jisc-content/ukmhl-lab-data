ANATOMY OF HAIRS. 301 and pointed towards the aperture of the bulb; also seba- ceous follicles, nerves and blood-vessels distributed within the bulb. Of rny own knowledge, I cannot say that such numerous structures are to be discovered in the human hair; and rather suspect, that these descriptions are taken from the formation of the feathers of birds, or the large feelers or bristles which serve particular purposes in different animals. If you pull out a hair, it generally brings along with it the membranous sheath of its bulb, and the pulpy roots attached: these may be scraped off, when the form of the biilb is ap- parent, of a white colour, and having a soft filament still adhering at the extremity or entrance to the bulb. In those anifnals which have feelers attached near their noses and jaws, the bulbous extremity is enclosed in a ten- dinous sheath, which is again enveloped in a sheath or cap- sule of a cartilaginous consistence: these capsules are open at each extremity; externally, to enclose the tube of the feeler; and internally, to admit of the nerves and blood- vessels which are distributed to them. The space between the two capsules is lined with a vascular membrane, giving it a complete red colour, and is filled with a limpid watery fluid; in which, and on the membrane, an abundance of ner- vous filaments are distributed. In this cavity the bulb of the feeler is moveable; and being confined by the enclosure of cutis immediately above the cartilaginous structure, the mo- tion at the free extremity of the feeler is communicated to the fluid enclosure, and delicate nervous filaments enclosed within it. From the extraordinary size of the nerve, and its termination in a watery medium, it is not improbable that a sense similar to that of hearing may be communicated by this curious structure. The bristles or feelers are erected, turned in various directions, or fixed, by numerous minute muscles attached to the cartilaginous capsule: and it is remarkable, that the minuter hairs around the feelers are arranged diverging from their entrance to the skin, so as not to interfere by contact with the more delicate motions com- municated from without.

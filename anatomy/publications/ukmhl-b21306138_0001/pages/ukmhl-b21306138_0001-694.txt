ANATOMY OP' NAILS, 308 Sir Astley Cooper (the ung'ual gland; who remarks, that a notch made in the root or base ol‘ the nail, will be three months growing out; from whence we may conclude, that the nails renew themselves about four times in the year, d'he nails very often grow into the sides of the fingers and toes ; but more particularly in the latter, from the increased pressure of tight shoes. In young persons, this may be relieved by scraping the nail thin ; cutting a notch in its free extremity, and by placing a small portion of lint under the pressure; where this will not succeed, it is necessary to pass a small pair of scissors under the nail, and detach a slip from one side, which will effect a cure. In elderly people, this would be attended with danger, and must not be attempted, from the languid circulation, and consequent tendency to gangrene in their lower extremities. The nails occasionally will grow to a certain distance, when ulcerations will form under them ; this disease is often diEScult to cure, and cannot be effected until the ungual portion of the nail is destroyed,—an operation attended with excessive pain. An application of arsenical ointment placed above and under the nail, is perhaps the best mode of effect- ing their separation. END OF VOL. SECOND.

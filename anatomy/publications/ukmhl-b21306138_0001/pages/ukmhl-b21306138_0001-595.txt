DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 209 breiicltli above, and the centre part below, and from the ung’les of the tibia and fibula, to which the interosseous liofaraent is attached; from these several attachments the O * ^ ^ fibres descend obliquely downwards, and terminate in a strong’ round tendon which passes behind the malleolus in- ternus, throug'h a groove formed for it in the tibia, proceed- ing'obliquely forwards and inwards in the sole of the foot, to be inserted principall}’^ into the upper and inner part of the os naviculare, sending tendinous fibres, which are at tached to the internal, and external cuneiform bones, to the cuboid, to the os calcis, as well as to the second and third metacarpal bones. The tendon of this muscle, as it passes beneath the astra- galus, is furnished with a bursa mucosa, and sometimes with a sesamoid bone. The origin of this muscle has some few fibres passing through the upper interosseal opening, and is therefore de- scribed by some anatomists as arising from the anterior part of the tibia and fibula. The rest of its anterior surface covers portions of the tibia, fibula, interosseous ligament, and some of the tarsal ligaments. The posterior surface of the tibialis posticus is covered by the fascia separating the superficial, from the deep seated muscles, and by the flexor longus digitorum, and flexor pollicis; the two latter of which, although they partly cover this muscle, I have not deemed it necessary to separate them in my classification of the muscles belonging to* the functions of the ancle-joint. The tendon of this muscle, when it has reached the sole of the foot, passes under, and supports a strong ligament, which extends from the os calcis to the os naviculare, underneath the astragalus; and is principally concerned in maintaining, or receiving the weight of the body, when jumping from an eminence. Use.—To extend tlie ancle-joint, and to direct the inner edg'c of the foot upwards. The m.

XVI LECTURES ON ANATOMY. hews the material for his habitation. Rightly considered, this reflection cannot be supposed to derogate from the dig’- nity of human nature; for the modifications of matter in man is in many respects so different, and in all so superior, that it justly entitles him to be disting-uished as the noblest of created being’s. He derives this distinction from a faculty, of which the superiority appears immeasurable, even when compared with the highest of those possessed by the subor- dinate beings. All bodies possessing organization and life are divided into two classes, the animal and the vegetable, and which present many points of mutual affinity. They both possess the power of producing changes within themselves; both have the faculty of generating new modifications of matter during their growth and developement: thus recruiting that waste of body which is continually going on, by the assimilation of foreign matter. These are the phenomena that constitute the great dis- tinction between organized and inert matter: accordingly, those objects in which this inherent vital principle is found, are designated generally as living matter ; while those in which it does not exist, are comprehended under the term inorganic matter: but when living matter loses these vital functions, or, in other words, when it is deprived of the power of appropriating and assimilating foreign matter into its owm substance, it retains merely the essential properties of common matter, into which it resolves itself, and in that state is capable of being effected by ordinary chemical agents. These two classes are, however, distinguished by characteristics sufficiently obvious: the animal being endowed w ith sensa- tion, thought, and volition; while the vegetable is destitute of those functions. This distinction being acknowledged, w^e are now^ to en- quire on what ground man claims so hig’h a preeminence -above the other individuals of the class to which he belongs, and by what title he holds the distinction of being “ the paragon of animals.” The deductions of anatomy, though

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, 133 posteriorly it lies upon the muscles of the little finger, fascia palmaris, ulna artery and nerve. fascia'palmaris—is extended from the annular liga- ment of the wrist, and from the tendon of the palmaris longus muscle by a narrow commencement; it proceeds downwards, its fibres diverging so as to cover the inferior surface of the palm of the hand, while it only covers the central third of the superior, leaving the bases of the meta- carpal bones of the thumb and fore finger uncovered. It is attached to the inferior extremities of the four metacarpal bones, admitting the passage of the tendons to the fingers. This fascia is very dense and strong, and may be divided into four distinct fasciculi, which are connected by cross bands. The anterior surface of this fascia is covered by the skin, palmaris brevis muscle, and superficial palmar arch of the ulnar artery; posteriorly it covers the tendons and muscles of the palm of the hand, to which it gives strength and support. On removing the palmar fascia, we expose the muscles which are underneath it in the following order ; those proper to the thumb, on the outer side ; those proper to the little finger, on the inner side ; and in the middle, the tendons of the^ long flexors common to the fingers, with the lumbricales attached to them. The origin and insertion of the long flexors have already been described; but we have now, to complete the muscles connected with the function of flexion of the fingers, to dissect the third or short flexor. The m. lumbricales—are four small muscles, which arise from the outer side of the tendons of the flexor profundus perforans muscle, immediately they have passed from under the ligamentum carpi annulare ; and as those tendons, so do tlie lumbricales muscles diverge, and direct themselves to- wards the fingers, forming four distinct fasciculi. Beginning from the outer side, the first is attached to the radial side of the deep flexor of the index finger; the second to the

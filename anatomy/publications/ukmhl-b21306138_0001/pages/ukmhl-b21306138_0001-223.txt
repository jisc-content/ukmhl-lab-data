161 BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. I’he internal surface presents two articular faces ; the pos- terior one the larg'or, which is connected with the middle cuneiform bone, while the anterior one receives a portion of the metatarsal bone of the second too; and between these two articular surfaces, the bone is roug^h for the attachment of interosseous lig-aments. The external surface presents a large rounded articular face, by which it is joined to the cuboid bone. Attachment of Muscles.—The m. flexor brevis and adductor pollicis pedis, and part of the tibialis posticus, which is attached to all the cimeiform bones, arc connected to the os cuneiformc externum. Os Cuboides. This bone is situated at the anterior and outer part of the tarsus, being placed betw'een the calcis and metatarsal bones of the fourth and fifth toes. The superior surface of this bone is broad, rough, and di- reeted obliquely outwards, forming a considerable portion of the outer edge of the tarsus. Its inferior surface is divided into two by a deep sulcus, which is directed from without to within and from behind to before, and lodges the tendon of the peroneus longus. The portion of bone anterior to this groove is rough, for the attachment of ligaments connecting the cuboid with the metatarsal bones; and posterior to the groove, a considerable protuberance is formed for the in- sertion of the inferior plantar ligament. The anterior face presents an articular surface, which is directed from within to without, and from before to behind, divided into two parts for the articulation of the fourth and fifth toes. The posterior face is convex from above to below, and slightly concave from side to side, to be articulated with the calcis. The internal face has two articulatory surfaces : the larger flattened anterior one, to connect it with the external cuneiform, and the posterior, for its junction with the os M

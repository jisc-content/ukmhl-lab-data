77 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. attempting- to explain it. Upon the whole, however, 1 am disposed to conclude, that even in these eases, if not indeed in every case, a minute attention to the state of respiration will afford the true solution; or, in other words, that as in the expression of countenance indicative of, and produced by, an obviously hurried or impeded respiration ; the modi- fications of the countenance, expressive of the various pas- sions and emotions, may be traced to a certain state or condition of the muscles of expression called into existence by their subserviency to respiration,—that function being- influenced by the particular emotion; the association being such as anatomy and physiology sufficiently explain. Be this as it may we know, at least, that during any violently excited respiration, the chest becomes expanded, the shoulders raised, the mouth and nose opened, and the w’hole countenance thereby pourtraying a certain consequent expression ; whilst any mental or morbid corporeal cause impeding respiration, has also its corresponding expression. Thus in grief, which may be fairly taken as an instance of impeded respiration, we find that the visage undergoes a change which marks the peculiar passion ; and the expres- sion of the face characterises the inward sensation, by its contracted state: the eyebrows approach each other, the mouth is drawn down, and the nose becomes pinched so as to diminish the size of the external openings ; at the same time the chest is flattened, and its slowly alternating eleva- tion and depression, with the occasional sigh or sob, suflfi- ciently indicate an impeded respiration. While in the expression of joy, on the contrary, the whole countenance is lighted up, the eyebrows and eyelids are raised, the aloe of the nose and angles of the mouth are drawn up- ward; and the playful motions of the mouth denote the necessity of a corresponding change of form with the state of the lungs, which breathe with a freedom marked by the quickened elevation of the chest, and the occasional laugh, which is but a succession of frequent expirations. These passions in the best possible manner denote the reciprocal

DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 117 fleshy orig'in on each side of the insertion of the deltoid muscle ; it also arises fleshy from the remaining” part of the anterior surface of the humerus: from these orig-ins the muscle becomes broader, descends in front of the elbow- joint, adhering” to the anterior ligament, and forms a strong tendon, which is inserted into a rough depression immedi- ately below the coronoid process of the ulna. The inner origin of this muscle lies between the inser- tions of the deltoid and coraco brachialis; the outer origin between the insertion of the deltoid and origin of the third head of the triceps: the belly of the muscle is covered by the biceps : the tendon passes down through the triangular space formed by the supinator radii longus, and pronator radii teres, and is here covered by the tendon of the biceps. Use.—To flex the fore arm and to strengthen the elbow-joint. The m. triceps extensor cubiti—arises by three distinct heads: the first, or long head, by a broad tendon from the anterior costa of the scapula, immediately below the glenoid, cavity, and is intimately connected with the glenoid ligament; this head separates the teretes from each other: the second head arises on the outer and back part of the greater tubercle of the os humeri, commencing immediately below the point where the teres minor is inserted: the third head arises from the inner edge of the bicipital groove, commencing imme- diately below the insertion of the teres major. By the union of these origins, a thick fleshy muscle is formed in the middle of the posterior part of the humerus, being attached to the lateral ridges of the bone as far as the condyles ; it then forms a strong thick tendon, which firmly unites to the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint, and is inserted principally into the olecranon, but descends also to be attached to the superior part of the posterior spine of the ulna. This tendon sends oflF an aponeurotic expansion to assist in forming the general fascia of the fore arm. By attending to the relative position of the three heads of this musclo with respect to the teretes as described, the pupil readily

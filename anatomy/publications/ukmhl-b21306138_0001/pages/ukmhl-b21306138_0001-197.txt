BONES OF THE EXTREMITIES. 139 tlic application of paste-board splints and roller, and tbe band being confined in a sling. It may further be observed, however, that when the extreme phalanx is broken, from the small size of that bone, as well as from its having the nail and its ungual gland connected with it, it is better at once to amputate than attempt to save it, as the process of reparation in this accident is always tedious and uncertain. The Lower Extremities. The bones of the lower extremities are connected with the inferior part of the trunk, and are divided into the thigh, leg, and foot. The Os Femoris. This bone alone forms the thigh; is the longest and hea- viest bone in the body, being situated between the bones of the pelvis and the tibia. It is divided into head, neck, body, and condyles. The head, which forms its articulatory sur- face for its attachment to the bones of the pelvis, is of a rounded form, and directed inwards and slightly forwards, forming about three fourths of the segment of a circle. It is every where covered with cartilage, excepting a small fossa placed upon its inner and upper part, to which the ligamentum teres is connected to the bone itself. The outer circumference of the head is encircled by a rough line, mark- ing the precise point of demarkation between the head and neck; this edge giving the inner attachment to the capsular ligament. From this point the neck proceeds downwards and outwards to the body of the bone, at an angle varying with the age of the individual, and at the adult period of life is about 45Â°. It is more slender where attached to the head of the bone: it is somewhat triangular in its form, presents a plane surface anteriorly, and is concave on its other as- pects. It is roughened, for the firmer attachment of the capsular ligament; and penetrated with foramina, for the transmission of vessels into the cancellated structure. The

PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, 262 are, liowever, several other irregular ligamentous fibres, con- necting the ossa innominata with the sacrum; but their course is so indistinct and uncertain, as to render it unavailing and useless to attempt their description. Articulation of the Pubes. The pubes are connected, by the junction of their sym- physes with an intervening fibro-cartilaginous substance, which is more thick anteriorly than posteriorly; and their union is rendered firmer by anterior and posterior hgaments, which pass transversely from the one bone to the other. The anterior ligament is composed of transverse liga- mentous fibres, which pass from one bone to the other, ante- rior to the intervening cartilage; it is connected wdth the periosteum of the pubes, and the aponeurotic expansion from the abdominal muscles. The posterior ligament is stronger than the preceding ; it is triangular, and is attached to the superior part of the arch of the pubes, passing some way down on the sides of the descending rami of this bone, and forming a shght curve, the concavity of which faces dowmwards. It produces the tri- angular ligament of the pubes ; and, from its inferior edge, a strong fascia is given off, which separates the perinseum from the contents of the pelvis ; admitting, how^ever, the urethra to pass through it. The obturator ligament comes particularly under consi- deration, as one of that class which is destined entirely for the purpose of presenting an extension of surface for the origin of muscle, and not for the usual office of binding bones together. It arises from the whole circumference of the obturator foramen, closing it every where, excepting at its upper part, where it leaves a small opening for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves; its fibres take an irre- gular course, frequently intersecting one another. Its an- terior surface gives attachment to the obturator externus ;

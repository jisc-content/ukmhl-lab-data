DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 191 Immediately below the pyriformis, a small muscle is seen running- parallel to it^ which is termed The tn. geminus superior—which arises from the outer edg-e of the spinous process of the ischium, and from the anterior sacro sciatic ligament, takes a course directly out- wards to be inserted into the fossa on the inner side of the trochanter major, between the insertions of the pyriformis, which is above it, and the obturator internus, which is below it. In this posterior view of these muscles, the next which presents itself in the order of dissection js the tendon of the obturator internus ; but to expose the fleshy orig-in of it, the subject must be turned round upon the back, when it will be found arising from the anterior and inferior parietes of the pelvis. The m. obturator internus—arises by aponeurotic fibres from that portion of the pubes which forms the inner part of the circumference of the foramen obturatorium; it also arises from the obturator ligament, which fills up that foramen, as well from the ischium between the foramen and the ischiatic notch; from these origins the fleshy fibres converge towards the spinous process of the ischium; at which point they form a tendon, wliich passes out of the pelvis, lodged in a slight groove covered with cartilage, placed between the spinous process and tuberosity of the ischium, and consequently between the two sacro sciatic ligaments. The tendon may then be seen in the position in which it was first described when the subject was lying- prone, passing to be inserted between the gemini muscles, with whose tendons it is connected, into the fossa on the inner side of the trochanter major. Within the pelvis, this muscle is placed between the levator aui muscle, and obturator ligament; and as it leaves the pelvis passing through the lesser sciatic notch, its tendon is furnished with a bursa mucosa placed between it and the bone. The m. geminus inferior—is placed below, but in conjunc-

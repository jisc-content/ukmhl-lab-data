266 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON, appearance, it has g’ained the name of a synovial g'land ; from thence it passes along’ the lig’amentum teres to the head of the femur,—the point at which we began our description. As this membrane passes along the ligamentum teres, it secludes it from its secreting cavity, precisely in the same manner as the abdominal viscera are secluded from the cavity of the peritoneum. The whole circumference of the head of the thigh-bone has many little granular substances on it, which appear to be folds of the synovial membrane; there is one, in particular, to be found immediately below the insertion of the interarticular ligament. This articulation is provided with blood-vessels and nerves from the obturator artery and nei’ve, just at their passage through the obturator foramen, and also from the circumflex arteries. Motions of the Hip-Joint. The motions of the hip-joint are much the same with those of the shoulder, excepting that the rotatory motions are to a much less extent, in consequence of the greater depth of the acetabulum, in relation to that of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and of the comparatively stronger and shorter cap- sular ligament; but the joint is capable of flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation outwards, rotation inwards, and circumduction. First, flexion.—^When the femur is flexed the thigh is bent upon the pelvis, and its inferior extremity is carried forwards ; the great trochanter is thrust backward towards the sciatic notch; the head rolls in the acetabulum on its own axis. The capsular ligament is slightly stretched posteriorly; but, if flexion be carried to its greatest degree, the distension of the ligament becomes considerable, in proportion to the extent of action. Secondly, extension.—This motion is produced by the in- ferior extremity of the thigh-bone being carried backwards; the trochanter major is brought forwards, and is situated

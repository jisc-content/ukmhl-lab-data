DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 1 11 atrang'ement of attachment, the muscles of the fore part of the arm are separated from those of the back part; the two sets of muscles being- thus inclosed in two separate bags of fascia. It is necessary to remark this arrangement, from the circumstance, that an accumulation of matter formed in one bag does not communicate with the other. This aponeurosis becomes thicker and dense as it approaches the elbow, where it completely surrounds the muscles, and is firmly attached to the condyles of the humerus and olecranon of the ulna. Use.—The nse of this aponeurosis is to support and gtrenj^then the muscles, covering’ them b,oth collectively amd individually, and pre- venting their displacement during action. The m. deltoides—is a thick triangular muscle covering the upper part of the shoulder: it arises tendinous from the outer third of the clavicle, from the acromion and whole length of the inferior edge of the spinous process of the scapula. The clavicular fibres are directed downwards and backwards, the acromial fibres vertically downwards, and those arising from the spinous process pass obliquely downwards and forwards; the fibres thus converging unite in a tendon to be inserted into the rough surface situated immediately above the centre of the outer part of the os humeri. This muscle is composed of numerous large fas- ciculi, separated from each other by strong tendinous fibres ; its outer surface is merely covered by skin, and a few fibres of the platysma myoides ; it covers the supra, and a consi- derable portion of the infra spinatus muscles, and the inser- tion of the teres minor: in passing over the coracoid process of the scapula, it covers the insertion of the pectoralis minor, and the origins of the coraco brachialis muscle and short head of the biceps: its vertical or acromial fibres cover the Insertion of the subscapularis, and the origin of the long head of the biceps, below which it passes over the tendinous insertion of the pectoralis major; and, at its point of in^ier- tion, its tendon is placed between the two origins of the brachialis intern us: from the posterior edge of the deltoid, a strong fascia is given off, which covers the infra spinatus

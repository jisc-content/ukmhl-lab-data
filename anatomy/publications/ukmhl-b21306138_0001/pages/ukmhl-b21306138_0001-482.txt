DESCRimVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 96 points it is directed downwards and inwards, passing" be- tween the occipital and sphenoidal origins of the superior constrictor of the pharynx, it is inserted into the whole length of the velum, as far as the azygos uvulae. The two muscles in the median line are so intimately connected with each other, as to form an arch, the convexity of which is directed downwards, and rests upon the palato pharyngeus muscles. This muscle is situated behind and above the eustachian tube, which is found between this and the last described muscle. Use.â€”To raise the soft palate, bringing it on a plane with the roof of the mouth ; so as to cut off the communication between the upper part of the pharynx, into which the nares and eustachian tubes open ; from the lower part, which leads into the oesophagus. The narrow opening leading from' the mouth to the pha- rynx, is termed the isthmus faucium, which may be either enlarged or contracted by the action of the five pairs of muscles which have been just described. It is by the dif- ferent motions of the soft palate,which forms the upper boun- dary of this passage, that the food is directed into the pha- rynx ; that inspired air is led into the glottis; or that expired air is forced partly through the nostrils, or into the cavity of the tympanum: hence at once it is clear, from this consi- deration, that this part has most important and very different functions to perform, and requires therefore a complicated and perfect organization to render it efficient to its several offices. In looking into the posterior part of the mouth, the uvula is seen hanging down from the centre of the velum pendulum palati; to this little body may be adjudged the peculiar power of preparing the whole apparatus for the next office to be performed, it may indeed be considered as the centinel which regulates the direction of the substances which are intended to be swallowed or ejected, and of the air which is either to be inspired or expired; and at the same time keeping the parts in such reciprocal action, that the function of respiration should not be suspended during the

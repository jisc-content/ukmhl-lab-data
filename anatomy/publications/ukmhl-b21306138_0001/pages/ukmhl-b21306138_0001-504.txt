DESCRimVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 118 comprehends their origins; the posterior surface of this muscle is covered by the fascia and common integuments, the anterior surface is in contact with the humerus, spiral nerve and superior profunda artery; and close to its inser- tion with the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. Use.—To extend the fore arm, and to carry it backwards and in- wards when the long head is principally in action. The m. anconeus—is usually described when speaking of the muscles arising from the external condyle; but ac- cording to my arrangement is now to be described as one of the extensors of the elbow-joint. It arises from the outer and inferior part of the external condyle of the humerus connected with the tendon of the triceps, it forms a triangular fleshy muscle, adheres to the posterior and external lateral ligaments of the elbow-joint; and passing over the superior radio ulnar articulation, where it has a bursa underneath it, is inserted into a flat roughened sur- face, below and to the outer side of the olecranon, and into the posterior spine of the ulna. This muscle is covered posteriorly by the integuments and tendon of the triceps; anteriorly, it is in contact with the supinator radii brevis, and covers the annular ligament of the radius ; it is situated between the olecranon and origin of the extensor carpi ulnaris, • Use.—To assist the triceps in extending the fore arm. In the progress of dissection, we will now describe the fascia of the fore arm. It arises around the elbow-joint, proceeding anteriorly from the aponeurotic expansion of the tendon of the biceps; posteriorly, from the tendinous inser- tion of the triceps ; and laterally, from the condyles and intermuscular tendons, which have already been described: from these sources it descends over the fore arm, forming a strong aponeurotic investment, which confines the muscles in their proper situation, and maintains the general contour of the arm. At the wrist it assists anteriorly in forming the lig^raentum carpi annulare, which is rendered ihfi-

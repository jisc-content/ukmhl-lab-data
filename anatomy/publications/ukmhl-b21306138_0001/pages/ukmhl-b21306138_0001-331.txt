articulations of the lower extremities, 269 easily distinguishable, if but common attention be paid, for there is nothing similar in the two accidents e.xcepting the shortening of the limb; the fixed position of the joint in dislocation, and its moveable state in fracture, will at once preclude the possibility of mistaking one injury for the other. Dislocation of the thigh-hone dowmoards and forwards into the foramen ovale.—The diagnostic marks of this injury are so completely characteristic, as to render its nature at once obvious. The limb is lengthened to a considerable degree, the thighs are widely separated from one another, and the knee of the injured limb is advanced; the foot is somewhat everted, and the toes only rest upon the ground; the pelvis is bent upon the thighs, in consequence of the state of tension incident to the psoas and iliacus muscles, and a flatness of the thigh is produced by the extended state of the muscles situated upon it. The head of the bone can be felt deeply seated on the inner and superior part of the thigh; the trochanter major is considerably removed from the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; and the voluntary motion of the extremity is totally lost. The capsular ligament is lace- rated, as well as the ligamentum teres, although some have said that the latter is not necessarily torn through; but the head of the bone cannot be thrown completely out of the acetabulum, in any direction, without producing such a consequence. The increased length of the limb, the separation of the thighs, and the bending of the body, are, therefore, the principal diagnostic symptoms. Dislocation forwards on the pubes.—This is an accident of rare oc- currence, compared with the two preceding; but it does occasionally take place, and may be at once known from any of the other luxations to which the thigh-bone is liable, by the outward rotation of the whole limb, by the head of the bone being felt just above Poupart’s ligament in the situation of the anterior crural nerve, upon which it sometimes presses so as to produce numbness and pain. The trochanter major is nearer to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium; and the impossibility of producing rotation inwards of the injured limb, suffi- ciently marks the nature of the accident. This dislocation is the accident of all others most liable to be con- founded with fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone; being alike cha- racterized by shortening of the limb, and eversion of the foot; but the fixed state of the limb in dislocation, and the comparative facility with which it may be moved in fracture of the neck, form an unequivocal distinction. Dislocation backwards into the ischiatic notch.—In this case the head of the bone is thrown behind the acetabulum, and a little above the centre of that cavity; so that the limb is somewhat shortened, and the

96 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. which, when completed by the pubes, forms the line of de- marcation between the cavities of the abdomen and pelvis. The notches found upon this bone are two anteriorly, and one large one posteriorly. Those anteriorly, are one between the two anterior spinous processes, which is filled up by the iliac muscle, and is termed, therefore, the iliac notch: while the one below the anterior and inferior spinous process, be- tween it and the body of the bone, allows of the passage of both the psoas and iliac muscles out of the pelvis, and may therefore be designated the ilio-psoal notch. The posterior notch, the longest of the three, is placed immediately beneath the posterior and inferior spinous process, forming the upper part of the great ischiatic notch. Several foramina may be seen on both surfaces of the bone, for the entrance of the nutritious vessels. Connexion,—The ilium is connected with the ischium and pubes, in forming the acetabulum ; and also with the body of the pubes, by the linea ilio-pectiuea; with the sacrum, pos- teriorly, by the sacro-iliac symphysis ; and with the head of the thigh-bone, by enarthrosis. The Os Ischii Is situated at the lower and lateral part of the pelvis, and is of a very irregular form ; but we may distinguish upon it the following parts:—A body, spinous process, neck, tube- rosity, and ascending ramus. The body of this bone forms its thickest portion, and is furnished anteriorly with an arti- culatory surface, constituting the lower and back part of the acetabulum, of which cavity it forms rather more than two fifths. From the posterior part of the body projects inwards the spinous process, forming the lower anterior boundary of the upper division of the ischiatic notch, and giving attach- ment to the anterior sacro-sciatic ligament, the m. geminus superior, levator ani, and coccygeus. Below the body of the bone it is slightly contracted, to form the neck, which is

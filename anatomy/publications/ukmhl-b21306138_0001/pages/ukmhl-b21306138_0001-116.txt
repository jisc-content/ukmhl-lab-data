72 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. naturally transparent parts of the eye have become opaque; upon which, if the disease be of the eye itself, it will be observable, shining like some metallic substance at the bottom of the organ: while, on the contrary, if it be exostosis, it is situated behind the sclerotic coat, and cannot therefore be discovered. The Lacrymal Fosses Are placed on the inner side of the orbits, and lead into the lower chamber of the nose, as a long- canal. They are formed by the ossa ung-uis, the nasal plates of the superior maxillary, and by processes of the inferior spong-y bones. They contain the lacrymal sac and duct, w'hich are continuous with the tunica conjunctiva above, and the pituitary membrane of the nose below. Practical Remarks. The duct is sometimes obliterated, and suppuration takes place in the sac, producing the disease termed fistula lachrymalis; the cure for which is to pass an instrument from the sac through the duct into the nose, and thus render the passage again pervious. This operation is performed by laying the sac open immediately below the attachment of the tarsi, to the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone: but, in doing this, care should be taken not to use so much force as to injure the delicate structure of the os unguis. A style is then passed down the duct, and allowed to remain there until the passage of the tears is per- fectly re-established. The Nostrils. By this term is meant the bony part of the nose, forming- the osseous cavity, for the protection of the more delicate structures which enter into the composition of the true org-an of smell: for the cartilag-es, and softer anterior parts, are to be considered as subservient to the respiratory functions, which the nose assists in performing-, rather than to the olfac- tory function. There are fourteen bones which enter into the formation of the bony part of the nose, and which are placed in the follow -

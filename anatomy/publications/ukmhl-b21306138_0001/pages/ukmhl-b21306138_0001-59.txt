17 PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES, separated parts are susceptible of re-union, by a process of reparation analag-ous to that which takes place in the softer substances of the human body, if affected in a similar man- ner. Bones, however, fall more slowly into disease than the softer parts, and their restoration is proportionably more tardy: they receive their nutriment chiefly from the periosteum; and hence it is, that disease or injury to that membrane immedi- ately affects the bone itselfâ€”a circumstance that should ever be borne in mind by the surgeon when operating upon bone; for it is scarcely possible that any very extensive destruction of periosteum can occur without exfoliation of the bone itself. However, it is not my intention to enumerate all the dis- eases to which bone is liable, as I should then encroach upon the province of surgery, rather than adhere strictly to the duties of an anatomical writer; yet I would wish to direct the attention of my readers to the similarity of the diseased action of every structure in the body; and although this idea may appear difficult to comprehend at a first view of the subject, still, if we remember that, even in structure, bone differs only from the softer parts of the body in having earthy matter superadded to its other constituent parts, the mystery is much diminished : and, moreover, it is found that the bones are liable to disease in proportion as their animal substance preponderates over their earthy particles. Hence, in youth, we find them much more frequently affected than at later periods of life. o

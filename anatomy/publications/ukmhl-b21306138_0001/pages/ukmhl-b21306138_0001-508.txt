122 DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES, they arrive at the base of the first phalanx, where each of them becomes enclosed in a sheath or theca with a deep flexor tendon ; thus they proceed to the second phalanx, where the flexor sublimis splits into two for the tendon of the flexor profundus to pass through it to be inserted into the extreme phalanx, while the tendon of the flexor sublimis is inserted into the anterior part of the second phalanx. The origins of this muscle are covered by the pronator radii teres, flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus; the belly of the muscle continues down the arm under the apo- neurosis, behind the annular ligament and palmar fascia, to reach its four insertions, as already described. The muscle, in its course down the arm, lies upon the flexor profundus perforans, the flexor longus pollicis, the median nerve, the lumbricales muscles, and lastly, the phalanges of the fingers, ' Use.—To bend the second phalanges of the fingers upon the first, and contribute to the contractions of the fingers as in grasping. The m. Jiexor carpi ulnaris.—This is the last of the five muscles superficially situated between the radius and ulna in front; it arises from the inner side of the internal condyle of the humerus, and from the olecranon process of the ulna by a separate and distinct fasciculus, the ulna nerve and recurrent artery being situated between the two origins ; it also arises aponeurotic from the posterior ridge of the ulna, running down as far as the pronator quadratus muscle, and from the fascia of the fore arm; from these tendinous origins, the fibres pass obliquely downwards and outwards, forming a semipenniform muscle, to be attached to a tendon which is inserted into the pisiform bone of the carpus; dividing here into two sets of fibres—the one of which crosses the ulna artery to be attached to the annular liga- ment, so as to form a foramen for the vessel; while the others pass downward to be connected with tlie palmar fascia. This muscle is covered anteriorly by the fascia of the fore

49 BONES OF THE HEAD. processes of the sphenoid bone. In conjunction, also, they form the upper and the lower jawsâ€”the former being im- moveably fixed to the cranium, while the latter, forming the principal organ of mastication, is attached by a moveable articulation to the temporal bones. Although the whole of that part of the face above the infe- rior maxillary bone maybe considered as constituting the upper jaw, still w'e shall find it composed of numerous separable bones, named from the different parts which they assist in forming; but, as a whole, they are so firmly connected as to be individually incapable of exercising any independent motion. The bones of the face consist of the ossa nasi, ossa unguis ft or lacrymalia, ossa malarum, ossa maxillaria superiora, ossa palati, ossa spongiosa inferiora, and os vomer. These are the bones which constitute the upper jaw, which at the adult period of life is furnished with sixteen teeth ; while the low'er jaw consists of a single bone, the os maxillare inferius, uith a hke number of teeth. I shall now proceed to describe each of these bones sepa- rately. The Ossa Nasi Are situated immediately under the nasal process of the os frontis, from which they project downwards and forwards, forming the dorsum of the nose: they are each of an oblong form, having their long axis from above to below, and present two surfaces and four edges. Their surfaces are an external convex one, to give strength and form to the nose; an internal concave one, to enlarge the cavity. Their superior edges are rough, thick and compact, producing a very firm connexion with the nasal process of the frontal bone ; and forming, by this union, a part of the transverse suture. The anterior edges are each slightly roughened, for attachment wdth its fellow. The posterior edges are peculiar, being hollowed above to receive the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and thin below, where they overlap the superior maxil- E

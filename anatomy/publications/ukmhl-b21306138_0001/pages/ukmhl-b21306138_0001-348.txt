286 PARTS ESSEN'riAL TO THE SKELETON. fibres of which run in the same direction as the external fibulo tarsal lig'ament, passing’ from the external face of the astrag’alus to the outer surface of the os calcis. Articulation of the os calcis and os naviculare.—In this articulation the surfaces of bone are not in contact, but the union is formed by two very strong- lig’aments,—the inferior or subastrag-ular, and external lig’arnent. The inferior or subastragular ligament is very firm, and almost cartilaginous in its texture: it extends from the smaller tuberosity of the os calcis as far as the inferior sur- face of the scaphoid bone: in its passage from one bone to the other it rests, below, upon the tendon of the tibialis posticus muscle; and above, it receives a portion of the astragalus. It is this ligament which is of such essential service in preventing violent concussion to the foot on jump- ing from a height; for being rather fibro-cartilaginous than true ligament, its elasticity, combined with its flexibility, renders it well calculated to resist injury from external violence. The external ligament is composed of very short fibres, which stretch from the anterior part of the calcis, to the infe- rior and outer edge of the scaphoid bone. Articulation of the astragalus to the os naviculare.—The anterior extremity of the astragalus is rounded and fitted to a concave surface upon the posterior extremity of the navi- cular bone, both of which surfaces are covered by synovial membrane, and strengthened by one broad superior liga- ment, which covers the whole superior surface of the two bones: it is composed of very thin fibres, which are directed from behind to before. Some of its anterior fibres pass to the cuneiform bones. Articulation of the calcis to the cuboid bone.—The arti- cular surfaces of these two bones, which are in contact, are maintained in that situation by two ligaments, and covered by synovial membrane. The superior ligament stretches from the superior and anterior part of the os calcis, to the superior surface of the

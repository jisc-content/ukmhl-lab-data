INTRODUCTORY LECTURE. XXi organs, acting’ in unison for the completion of one end, ne- cessary to vital existence; as dig-estion, &c., is effected in the conjoint operation of the stomach, bowels, liver, and pan- creas. Fifth.—Organismus is a term used to express the assem- blag'e (as before mentioned) of all the organs of the human body, performing their individual and natural -functions for the perfection and preservation of the whole. Now, in treating of any organized body, and more especi- ally that of the human body, w’e must first consider its structure and texture. The human body, in common with all organized bodies, presents a rounded form throughout, never presenting either an angle in its parts or its whole. With respect to its division, it may first be considered as divided by an imagi- nary vertical line, which separates it into two symmetrical sides, and like the bodies of all other vertebrated animals, is divided into head, trunk, and extremities. The trunk forms its central part. We further observe in the whole frame, three principal cavities, which enclose the organs called viscera, and which are absolutely essential to life. The head forms the superior cavity, is lengthened throug’h the vertebral column, and encloses in its whole extent the brain and spinal marrow, the centres of the nervous system and the senses. The middle cavity is the thorax, and is for the purpose of containing the organs of respiration and circulation. The lower cavity, the abdomen, lodges the organs of digestion, of the urinary secretion, and of generation. The extremities represent articulated appendices, and are distinguished by the denomination of superior or thoracic, and inferior or abdominal members. All these g’reat divi- sions of the body consist of many subdivisions, a full de- scription of which belongs to special anatomy; but as a general remark it may be observed, that both the principal divisions and the subdivisions of the whole, arc determined

PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES. 5 of the orig’inal bone. Those apophyses offer considerable varieties, both as to their use and config-uration. They may, however, be divided into three g-rand divisions:—First, apo- physes of articulation; secondly, of insertion; and thirdly, of reflexion. Those of the first division, or the apophyses of articulation, differ according- to the form and motions of the joint of which they are destined to form a part, and will be more particularly described when speaking- of the joints in g-eneral. The second division, the apophyses of insertion, are very numerous in most of the bones: they are for the purpose of g-iving- attachment to muscles throug-h the medium of their tendons; they also afford attachment to lig-aments and apo- neuroses. These apophyses are much less developed in the female, than in the male; in the weak, than in the robust. Moreover, whether the apophyses be projecting- portions of bone to receive a tendinous attachment of muscle, whether it be in the form of an extended line for the aponeurotic attachment, or whether it be the asperity for the direct attachment of muscular fibre, we uniformly find the develope- ment of each of these kinds of apophyses proportionate to the energ-y of their respective muscles. The varieties in the external configuration of the long bones, produced by the degree of developement of these apophyses, are often very considerable, but without any corresponding deviation from the regular cylindrical form of their interior. The apophyses for ligamentous attachment are intended to remove, in some measure, the ligaments from the surface of those bones of which they are the uniting substance in the formation of a joint. fhose of the third division, the apophyses of refle.xion, are such, as under which a tendon passes in deviating from its primitive course: they are generally excavated; and, by the assistance of a ligament, formed into complete rings for the passage of tendons.

THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 303 are so articulated, that they not only servo to protect these org-ans, but arc enabled, in consequence of the mode in which the ribs are connected with the vertebra3 and sternum, to allow of a freedom of motionâ€”such a motion as shall not interfere with the flexibility of the spine, and at the same time admit of a constant and uniform dilatation and con- traction of the chest act of respiration. It will be perceived that the ribs and sternum, at least, present those physiological characters assigned to flat bones in general; their form and arrang-ement being such as to contribute to the protection of the viscera contained in the cavities which they form, as well as to assist in the perform- ance of the function of the viscera themselves. The elas- ticity of the cartilages forming the anterior portion of the ribs, tends also to facilitate their motions in the act of respiration, whilst, at the same time, it is calculated to obviate the effects of violence inflicted on the chest; and hence it is too, that when from age this elasticity is impaired or destroyed, hurried and laborious respiration becomes distressing to the indi- vidual, whilst violence is more likely to produce fracture. The upper extremities have already been mentioned, as enjoying a great degree of motion ; and if we examine, we shall find that each joint possesses an organization admirably adapting it to the oflSces nature has destined it to perform; and as the motions of the extremity as a whole are performed by the shoulder-joint, as we should naturally expect, we shall find the means employed to procure its extensive and various motions the most perfect. In the first place, the scapula, which forms the shallow articular depression for the head of the humerus, is connected with the trunk by nume- rous muscles, which are capable of giving motion to it in a greater or less degree in every direction, so that all the mo- tions of the shoulder are increased by those of the scapula. The articular cavity being shallow, and the head of the hu- merus forming the part of a segment of a large circle, as well as the length of the capsular ligament, also fits this articulation for extensive mobility. These circumstances all

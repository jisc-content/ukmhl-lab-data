DESCRIPTIVE ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 160 Use.—To bend the neck slightly forwards, and give some little rotatory motion of the atlas upon the second cervical vertebra. The m. rectus capitis anticus major.—This muscle ex- tends from the sixth cervical vertebra to the occiput; it arises tendinous from the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae, proceeds upwards and inwards, becoming" broader as it ascends, and is inserted into the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, behind the attachment of the pharynx, reaching" as far outwards as the condyloid process. This muscle is covered by the carotid sheath and its contents, by the pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus ; it lies partly upon the longus colli, rectus capitis anticus minor, and the articulations between the first and second cervical vertebrae ; it is placed between the scaleni and longus colli. Use.—To move the head slightly forwards, or laterally upon the atlas, according to the action of one or both muscles. The m. rectus capitis anticus minor—is shorter and narrower than the preceding muscle; it arises tendinous below from the anterior part of the root of the transverse process of the atlas ; from thence it expands as it ascends to be inserted into that portion of the cuneiform process of the occipital bone which forms the anterior margin of the foramen magnum, reaching as far laterally as the junction of the petrous portion of the temporal bone with the basilar process of the occipital. It is covered by the rectus capitis anticus major ; it covers the articulation between the atlas and occiput. Use.—To assist the last described muscle in bringing the head forwards. The muscles situated upon the lateral aspects of the spine, are the rectus capitis lateralis, the scaleni, the inter- transversales, and the quadratus lumborum; the latter muscle, however, I shall not describe, for the convenience of dissection, until treating of those arising from within the pelvis.

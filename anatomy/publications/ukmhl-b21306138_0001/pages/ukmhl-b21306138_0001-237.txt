LECTURE V. PARTS ENTERING INTO THE COMPOSITION OF JOINTS. In treating of articulations it will be necessary, in the first place, to give a separate consideration to each of the parts and structures which enter into their composition; for, although in cutting into a healthy joint, bone is not exposed, yet the first great character of a moveable articulation is the approximation of two or more bones, so far fitted to each other, which are rendered capable of performing its various functions by the addition of cartilage, synovial membrane, and ligaments ; and these structures, although subservient, tend to strengthen the articulation, and to give freedom and ease to its motions. Cartilage. Cartilage represents a solid, polished and very elastic sub- stance, of a pearly whiteness: it is slightly flexible, less hard and lighter than bone, but, excepting it, offers more firmness than any other structure in the body. In texture its fibres are very indistinct, being scarcely perceptible. This homo- genious appearance is in consequence of the great quantity of animal matter which enters into its composition, and from the small quantity of cellular membrane which connects its fibres; but by maceration or boiling, its fibrous and laminated texture may be demonstrated. In a state of health, no blood-vessels can be traced into cartilage, because they circulate only the colourless parts of the blood ; but under inflammation, or if there be a tendency

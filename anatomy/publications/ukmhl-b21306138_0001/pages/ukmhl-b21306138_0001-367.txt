THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 305 the melius and intemrticular cartilag’c also assists in deaden- ing- the shocks which the hand may receive. The carpus forms the upper boundary of the hand; and is not only ren- dered infinitely strong- by the number of the bones, but also by their arrang-ement; for they are so placed as to form an arch, the concavity of which is towards the palm, while the convexity is directed backwards, to resist violence in the direction in which it is most exposed. The metacarpus is composed of four bones, placed between the fingers and the carpus, and forms the palm of the hand, which is of a square form, but broader at its digital than at its carpal end, so that the metacarpal bones somewhat diverge inferi- orly, and thus serve not only to enlarge this surface, but also to extend the range of motion of the fingers. The bones of the metacarpus are concave in the palm, and convex on the dorsum of the hand; they are separated from each other to lodg-e and give attachment to muscles, as well as to en- crease the prehensive surface of the hand. The fingers are five in number, and enjoy both separately and collectively more motion than the other parts of the hand ; and however perfect the organization of the carpus and metacarpus may be, still, without the faculty of motion, and that peculiar adaptation of parts which the fingers possess, the hand would yet have been but ill fitted for the numerous and im- portant functions for which nature has intended it as a fit instrument to a rational being like man. The pelvis at the adult period of life is composed of three large bones, the ossa innominata and the sacrum—the os coccygis is rather to be considered as an appendix to the sacrum than as a separate bone in the formation of this cavity. The bones of the pelvis are all so firmly connected, and their adjustment so perfect as to their mechanical dis- position, as to be admirably constructed for the purposes of supporting the superincumbent weight of the trunk, for lodging and protecting the viscera within the cavity, and to form a fulcrum for the lower extremities to move on. These bones, in fact, form a double arch, which gives to them great X

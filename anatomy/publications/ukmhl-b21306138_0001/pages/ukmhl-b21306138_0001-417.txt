GENERAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. 31 vantag-e is g-ained by the velocity with which ' the point of resistance is thus made to move ; so that the advantag-e may be said to arise from gaining- in velocity what is lost in the expenditure of power. The obliquity of the direction of the muscular fibres also offers advantages during their action ; for although by this arrangement power is lost in exact proportion to the devia- tion of the muscular fibre from the direction of the moving point, still great benefit is derived from the saving of the quantity of contraction, as well as from the additional quantity of muscular fibre which is thus accumulated; for diminishing the necessity of contraction of muscle is a point of great importance, as the fatigue of muscle seems to de- pend upon the extent of contraction. Althoug'h most muscles have to use an additional force to overcome the action of their antagonists, and thus render an expenditure of power necessary from the composition of forces; still it is clear, that infinite variety and exactness of muscular motion is accomplished by this arrangement, as the moving body can range in every given space between the direct action of the various muscles, and therefore fewer muscles are required. In every example where muscular power is sacrificed, it will be found that some important benefit is derived; and that the symmetry of the body is preserved in such a manner as no other arrangement of the muscular system could admit. The effects produced by muscular contraction are, the determining both the altitude and the motions of the body in acting upon the skeleton, to move the organs of the senses, to produce modifications of the voice, and to con- tribute in a greater or less degree to the performance of the vegetative functions. To produce these effects, and par- ticularly when we reflect on the extent of exertion employed, the mind is led to comprehend the wonderful power with which this system is invested. Thus, according to Borelli, the power of the flexor muscles of the thumb is alone equal to four thousand pounds weight: nevertheless, from the dis-

260 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. verse process of the last lumbar vertebra, and passes out- vpards to be attached to the posterior and superior spinous process of the ilium, extending as far downw’ards, anteriorly, as to be mixed with the fibres of the sacro ligaments; in this situation the ligament is divided into two sets of fibres, which gain the distinction of superior and inferior transverse liga- ments of the pelvis. Above, this ligament is covered by the quadratus lumborum muscle ; anteriorly, by the psoas mag- nus ; and, posteriorly, it partially gives origin to the lumbar mass of muscle. Articulations of the Bones of the Pelvis with one another. Articulation of the Sacrum and the Os Coccygis. Class Diarthrosis,—Subdivision Amphiarthrosis. This union is completed in the same manner with that which is common to the vertebrae; for the apex of the sa- crum, and the base of the os coccygis, have corresponding oval surfaces, connected by a fibrous cartilaginous tissue, similar to the intervertebral substance, but not quite so thick; a continuation of the common anterior and posterior liga- ments of the vertebrae, serve to strengthen this articulation, so that a further description of these hgaments is unneces- sary. Connexion of the Sacrum with the Ossa Innominata ; or, Sacro Iliac Articulation. This union, termed the sacro iliac symphisis, is formed by the junction of the sacrum and ilium, through the medium of an intervening cartilage. The following ligaments serve to render this articulation firm. The ^posterior sacro sciatic ligament arises from the pos- terior and inferior spinous process of the ilium, from the sides

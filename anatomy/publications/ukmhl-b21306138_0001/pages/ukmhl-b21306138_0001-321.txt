LECTURE X. ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITIES. Articulations of the Pelvis, The lig-aments which serve to strengthen these articulations may be divided into two sets ; those which attach the pelvis to the vertebrae, and those which connect the different bones of the pelvis with each other. There are but two of the first order which differ, in any respect, from the ligaments com- mon to the vertebrae ; for the superior surface of the sacrum is found connected with the last lumbar vertebra by an inter- vertebral substance ; a continuation of the common anterior and posterior ligaments of the vertebrae also strengthens this connexion ; capsular hgaments are found attaching the arti- cular processes of the sacrum to the last lumbar vertebra; and, lastly, similar interspinous ligaments, and a continuation of the ligamentum subflavum, serve to connect them. There are, how^ever, two others which require a particular des- cription. First, the sacro lumbar ligament, which arises from the inferior and anterior part of the transverse process of the last lumbar vetebra, and passes downwards and outwards, to be inserted into the superior part of the sacrum. This ligament is of a triangular form, its apex being above, where it is con- nected with the ilio lumbar, and its base being below; its fibres are intermixed with those of the ilio sacral ligament. Its anterior surface is covered by the psoas magnus muscle, while it covers posteriorly the fibres of the ilio lumbar liga- ments. Secondly, the ilio lumbar ligament arises from the trans-

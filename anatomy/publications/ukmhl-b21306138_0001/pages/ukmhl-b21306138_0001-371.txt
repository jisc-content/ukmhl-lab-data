THE SKELETON IN GENERAL, 309 wliich it is subjected, by resting- upon a fibro-eartilag-inous structure; which structure allows it to sink or rise as sub- jected to or relieved from pressure. A second long-itudinal arch is formed from the extremity of the metatarsus to the extremity of the toes, which renders them both stronger and prehensive, and assists much in progressive motion. A third arch is formed in the sole of the foot besides the two already described, which reaches from side to side, and serves not only to assist in giving elasticity and strength, but also to protect the soft parts, which might otherwise be injured from pressure. From these remarks it must be considered that the foot possesses a considerable degree of mobility; but it also must be remembered, that it exerts this mobility only during motion ; for when we are standing still in the erect posture, or when the weight of the body bears directly and perpendicularly on the astragalus, all the parts of the foot are so closely pressed together, as to render the whole an immovable and unyielding structure. The projection of the heel-bone, or os calcis, passes backwards considerably pos- terior to the articulation of the bones of the leg with the foot, so that in progressive motion the part of the foot which ' first comes to the ground shall not be placed immediately underneath, and perpendicular to the tibia and fibula; and thus the elasticity of the foot is called into action to prevent concussion and jolting. The lengthening backwards of the os calcis also affords additional power to the extensor mus- cles of the ancle-joint. The ancle-joint, which is formed by the union of the foot with the bones of the leg, admits of motion in such direc- tions as assists in the performance of the movable capabi- lities of the foot; and again, by projecting portions of bone, render the foot firmly fixed when its stability and strength are most required: for instance, in progressive motion, when the foot is pointed downwards or extended, then the astraga- lus is capable of lateral motion between the malleoli; so that the foot may be directed at will; while, on the contrary, when the whole of the body is thrown upon one extremity,

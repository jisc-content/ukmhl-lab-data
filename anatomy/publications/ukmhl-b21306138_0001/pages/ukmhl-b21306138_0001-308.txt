3246 PARTS ESSENTIAL TO THE SKELETON. treinity of the ulna, the superior surface of the interarticular cartilag’e, and the small articular cavity on the radius which receives the ulna. On a more accurate examination we may trace it, first covering' the outer surface of the styloid process of the ulna, from thence it descends upon the superior sur- face of the interarticular cartilag-e, passes upon it outwards to the point where this cartilag-e is connected with the radius, then is continued upon the cavity of the radius which receives the ulna, passes over to tiiat bone, forming' a cul de sac, or sacciform lig-ament (as it is called), between the two, then descending along the articular surface of the ulna, and ter- minating at the place from whence I commenced the des- cription ; this synovial cavity being entirely separated from that between the radius and the bones of the carpus by the interarticular cartilage. Motions of the Radio Ulnar Articulations. These motions produce pronation and supination of the hand, which are effected by the radius turning inw'ards or outwards on the ulna, and carrying the hand along with it. In pronation, the head of the radius turns upon the ulna in a direction from without to within, rolling within the annular ligament; while its inferior extremity turns also from without to within upon the ulna; describing in this motion a consi- derable portion of a circle; so that the relative position of the two bones becomes somewhat altered, by the radius ob- liquely crossing the ulna:—in this motion the palm of the hand faces backwards. Supination is produced by reversing the former motion, by bringing the two bones again parallel, and by directing the palm of the hand forwards. Practical Remarks. The head of the radiu.s may be dislocated from the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, so as to be thrown upon its fore or back part, which accidents, as I have before mentioned, are usually described as incident to the elbow-joint, but more properly belong to the superior radio-ulnar articulation. On examining the form of the articulatory surfaces of this joint, we

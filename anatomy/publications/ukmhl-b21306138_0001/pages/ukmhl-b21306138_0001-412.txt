2B GENEUAL ANATOMY OF MUSCLES. tho best for facilitating- tlieir description ; those of the larynx and of the senses being- treated with the particular descrip- tion of those parts. On considering the muscles of the skeleton then, those which are attached to the extremities are of an elongated form; while those of the trunk are broad, and cover the cavities of the skeleton, by which they assist in forming the abdomen, thorax and cranium. The long muscles attached to the extremities are more or less cylindrical, and have a considerable length of tendon attached to them, even sometimes longer than the muscle itself. When the long muscles extend over the long bones of the extremities, they * are generally divided into two layers, of which the external are the longer; as, for in- stance, may be observed on the arm, the biceps being much longer than the brachialis internus. Muscles of this kind frequently divide into several tendons for their inser- tion. The broad muscles are generally thin, and, as I have said, are usually assisting in forming the parietes of the cavities of the body; but beside which, they contribute to the function of the viscera, which they enclose, so that many of them are more justly to be considered as belonging to the mixed, than either to the voluntary or involuntary class of muscles. They generally maintain the same degree of thickness throughout their extent, and frequently arise by mixed digitations, by means of which they attach themselves to many parts. These muscles sometimes cover the long ones, as may be observed on the back: there are some of them which, although from their attenuated form and manner of attachment, resemble this class, yet have their breadth so little beyond their length, that they appear to form a link between this class and that of the long muscles. The short muscles are generally thick in proportion to their length and breadth, so that indeed their threefold dimensions are nearly equal; they are usually of a square form; they are the strongest of all the muscles, as they

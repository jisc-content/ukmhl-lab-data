S[)5 ARTICLE SECOND. ORGANS OF THE VOICE. OF THE LARYNX AND ITS APPENDAGES. GENEKAL DISPOSITION. 1471. The laryruv* is a symmetrical apparatus, formed of se- veral pieces moveable on each other 5 it is situated in the middle line of the body, at the upper and fore part of the neck, above the trachea, with whose cavity it communicates, and below the hyoid bone, to which it is connected by ligaments, and opposite which it opens into the back part of the mouth. The pharynx se- parates it posteriorly from the vertebral column, and muscles are interposed between it and the skin anteriorly. Cartilages, ligaments, muscles, glands, membranes, vessels, and nerves, enter into the composition of the larynx. This apparatus is destined to give passage to the air in the act of respiration, and to impress upon it certain modifications which constitute the voice. Its dimensions vary in different individuals, and are not always proportional to the stature. It is observed, however, to be always larger and situated lower in the male than in the female.

This is the largest of the cartilages of the larynx, of which It occupies the anterior and lateral parts. It is of greater extent in the transverse than the perpendicular direction, and is broader above than below ; it seems formed by the junction of two quadri- 'atcral laminjE, which, uniting in the middle line of the neck, produce an angle, open behind, and more or less prominent " Aasfi/T-g, Gr.

BONES IN GENERAL. 13 The following table contains an enumeration of the different ^ kinds of processes, together with their peculiar characters :— o ci serve for articula- tions. r the inser- tion of fibrous organs, whose points of attach- ment they multiply, are called, r Those which be- Heads, which are nearly hemispherical, long to t le I Condyles, which are broader in one direc- moveable ^^^^ ^^^^^^^ articula- tions : are Those be- rSerrce or Dentations, as in the bones of the longing to cranium. theimmove-< Moots, as in the teeth, able articu- Ridges, as is seen in those articulations, . lations: are called schindyleses. Impressions, irregular eminences, not much elevated but rather broad; they are form- ed of a great number of small tubercles placed very close together, and separated by slight depressions. Lines, unequal eminences, long but not neral form, \ very prominent. Crests, eminences resembling lines, but broader and more prominent. Prominences, when they are rounded, broad and smooth. Tuberosities, when rounded and rough. After the C Spinous processes, that is of the form of a bodies to spine. According to their se- which they j Styloid, like a style. ■ > ^ n -1 „ have been compared. According to their uses. According to their di- rection and relative si- tuation. Coracoid, like a crow's beak. Odontuid^Mke a tooth. Mastoid, like a nipple. ■ Trochanters, or those which are subservient to the act of turning. Orhiiar, belonging to the orbit, &c. j Ascending processes. \ Vertical ' Transverse Superior, &c. The re- flection of certain tendons which de- viate from their ori- ginal di- rection, Lare called J Corresponding to cavities exis'ting on the surface of some organs, I i^rocesses of impression. Pj'ocesses of reflection. are called 34. In the processes the direction of the fibres of the compact I ssue IS not the same as in the rest of the bone. They arc longi, tuciinal m those which are elongated, and run in all directions in 8UC11 as are large and thick ; but they are never radiated, except- ing in the protuberances of the broad bones of the cranium.

PASSIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. 88 and of the canal of the tensor tympani muscle; the sphenoidal spine ; the two portions of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, in one of which there is frequently noticed a small canal for the chorda tympani; the transverse root of the zygomatic process ; the spheno-temporal suture ; and lastly, the foramen spheno-spinosum and foramen ovale. 298. Anteriorly to the basilar suture, there is seen the sphenoi- dal crest which enters into the upper edge of the vomer; on the sides of the latter are two small grooves which receive the wings of this edge, and which are perforated at their bottom, but only in young subjects, by the lower orifice of a narrow canal which occurs in the outer wall of the sphenoidal sinuses ; there are also seen in it two narrow and not very deep channels, which concur to form the pterygo-palatine canals. Still more outwards, we find the pterygoid process; the posterior orifice of the vidian canal, which occupies its base ; the scaphoid depression situated on the upper and outer part of the inner wing of the pterygoid process, perfo- rated by vascular apertures which terminate on the other hand on the sides of the sella turcica, and giving attachment to the circum- ilexus palati muscle ; the pterygoid fossa, into which is inserted the pterygoideus internus ; the bifurcation which receives the tu- berosity of the palate bone ; and ihe hook over which is reflected the tendon of the circumflexus palati muscle. 299- Before the pterygoid process, which descends vertically, and which forms the most prominent part of this region of the cranium, is observed the anterior orifice of the vidian canal, which is wider than the posterior; beside it, and a little to the outside, is the external orifice of the foramen rotundum ; and, anteriorly and inwards, the entrance of the sphenoidal sinuses and the junction of the sphenoid bone with the sphenoidal turbinated bones and the ethmoid bone. The perpendicular plate of the latter bone is situ- ated between the orifices of the sinuses, and presents, on either side, two deep and narrow channels which form part of the nasal fossas, and at the bottom of which are found the olfactory foramina, and the small slit which gives passage to the internal nasal nerve. Anteriorly, is the point of contact of this plate with the nasal spine of the frontal bone, and the nasal notch of the same bone, which is continuous laterally with the orbitar arches, interrupted by the superciliary hole, which is generally but a superficial notch, and which is sometimes double : these arches terminate at the union of the frontal with the malar bone. 300. Between them and the pterygoid processes, are the two or- bitar vaults of the frontal bone, concave, triangular surfaces, hav- ing their base forwards, and in which there are seen, posteriorly, the sphenoidal fissure, or foramen lacerum anterius, the foramen opticum ; the lower surface of the process of Ingrassias ; the sphen- oidal suture; the external orbitar holes, small apertures most com- monly formed in a portion of the great wing of the sphenoid bone; and the internal orbitar holes, which are directed obliquely from

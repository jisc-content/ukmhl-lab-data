Of the Mouth* 2101. The Mouth (Os) is a nearly oval cavity, comprised be- tween the two jaws, bounded laterally by the cheeks, anteriorly by the lips, posteriorly by the velum palati and the pharynx, above by the arch of the palate, and below by the tongue. Its direction is horizontal. Its vertical diameter is liable to the greatest variations, on account of the motions of the lower jaw ; the antero-posterior is more fixed, and only varies by the motions of the lips; the transverse is in the same condition, being limited by the cheeks. All these dia- meters, moreover, present numerous individual differences. The walls of the mouth and the various organs which it contains, are invested by a common mucous membrane. OF THE COURSE OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE MOUTH. 2102. Inferiorly it commences on the free edge of the under lip, of which it lines the posterior surface, to be afterwards reflected upon the body of the maxillary bone; there it forms opposite the symphysis of the chin, a fold, more developed below than above, named the FrcBnum of the under lip, which is lost insensibly upon the lip. The membrane then sends into each alveolus a pro- longation which strengthens the insertion of the roots of the teeth, and is continuous with a membraneous lamina which lines these cavities. From thence it proceeds over the posterior surfiice of the • 2t«^« of the Greeks,

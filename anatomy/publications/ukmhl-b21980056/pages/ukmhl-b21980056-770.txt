INJECTING OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 75G should be taken to have every thing in readiness, as the want of some one trifling thing will now and then frustrate the whole pro- cess, and perhaps ruin a valuable preparation. A proper quantity of hot water to thoroughly heat the preparation; a fire sufficient to melt the injections of the several colours intended to be used ; as large a quantity of injection prepared as will be necessary, and of proper consistence, are the circumstances first to be attended to. The syringe should be hot, but not so as to destroy the valves: the pipes should be previously cleared out, and securely fixed in the vessels. Every thing being ready for the operation, the seve- ral pots of injection are to be placed near the subject to be injected; an assistant should then hold the pipe thus fixed in the vessel, so that the operator may expeditiously introduce the point of his syringe, when filled with injection, and always observing in filling the syringe, to put the point to the bottom of the pot, to avoid drawing in air; and it is best to fill and empty it once or twice be- fore we proceed to inject; when filled, convey the point of it into the pipe held by the assistant, then the operator should take the pipe between the fingers of his left hand, and depress the piston with his right, so as to force the fluid into the vessels with freedom, till they are nearly filled, which he will be sensible of, by an in- creasing resistance to its passage ; and lest the resistance should be in the syringe, he should move the piston by a screwing motion, when, sometimes he will find, he may proceed a little further with safety ; after a prudent force has been apphed for a short time, he is to remove his syringe, and force the remaining injection into the pot he took it from, and the assistant should always be ready ira-- mediately to turn the stop-cock, to prevent the return of the injec- tion from the vessel. If there are several vessels to be injected with different colours, as arteries, veins, excretory ducts, &c. the mode of injecting each is similar to the first. "It is impossible to ascertain the exact force, with which the pis- ton of the syringe should be pressed in the act of injecting; it va- rying greatly, under different circumstances: the force which is re- quisite to inject some vessels, would rupture and destroy others. Arteries, in general, will sustain greater pressure than veins, and either of them will sustain less if they are weakened by any degree of putrefaction. " When a large system of vessels is to be injected by a large pipe, the injection may be thrown in boldly at first, but when there is reason to expect, that it is nearly filled, the piston should be moved with greater caution, and the resistance aflbrded to the passage of the fluid carefully attended to, or else the vessels will probably be ruptured; when this happens, the operator is sensible of it by the feel; for the resistance to the passage of the injection is immediately taken off, and the fluid passes with the greatest fiicility ; it will then be in vain making any farther attempt to fill the vessels, un- less such rupture happens where the part may be secured by the finger and thumb of an assistant, or by a ligature, unless it is very

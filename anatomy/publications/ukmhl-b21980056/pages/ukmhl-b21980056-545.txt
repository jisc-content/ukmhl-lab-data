OF THE INFERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION. 531 ,tis nnticus major and longiis colli muscles, to which it gives ramifi- cations. OF THE INFiÂ£UIOH FILAMENT. 1888. It communicates with the first thoracic ganglion, and is sometimes double. In the latter case, it commonly embraces the subclavian artery between its two branches. OF THE INTERNAL FILAMENTS. 1889. Few in number, slender, and irregular in their disposi- tion, these filaments take different directions. Some of them lose themselves in the longus colli muscle ; the others go to the pul- monary plexus or to the arch of the aorta of the left side. There are some also which associate themselves with the reciu'rent and phrenic nerves. OF THE EXTERNAL FILAMENTS. 1890. Tliey are numerous and very slender. Collected into fas- ciculi, they embrace the subclavian artery, around which they form a plexus which accompanies its branches, subdividing like them, and which may be traced, with care, to the upper part of the arm. Those of the internal mammary artery in particular may be very distinctly seen. Some others lose themselves in the fibres of the scalenus anticus muscle, near its inferior attachment. There are also external filaments which anastomose with the an- terior branches of the cervical nerves, when they go to form the brachial plexus (1748), and with the first dorsal pair. OF THE ANTEIIIOB FILAMENTS. ^ 1891. They unite after a short course to form the inferior car- I diac nerves. OF THE CARDIAC NERVES. 1892. These nerves, which are particularly destined for the Heart, are three on each side, but do not present the same disposi- tion to the right and left; they unite with the cardiac gandion, t Irom which the cardiac plexuses are derived.

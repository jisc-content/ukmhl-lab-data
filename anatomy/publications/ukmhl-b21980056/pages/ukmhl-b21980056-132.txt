PASSIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. 120 from one part of the pelvis to that which corresponds to it on the other side, they are always horizontal; these parts being placed at the same level, on account of the symmetry of this portion of the trunk. 412. From the circumstance that the two straits of the pelvis have not the same inclination, each of them has necessarily a dif- ferent axis ; that of the abdominal strait, passing through the centre of the space it circumscribes, would fall upon the lower third of the sacrum, while the axis of the perineal strait would pass from its centre to the sacro-vertebral angle, and meet the former about the middle of the pelvic excavation, forming with it an obtuse angle opening anteriorly. Moreover, the axis of the great pelvis is near- ly vertical, while that of the small pelvis is sensibly oblique from above downwards, and from before backwards. It will be guessed, that this determination of the axis of the pelvis is not given here with mathematical precision; but, such as it is, it is of much imr povtance to the accoucheur to know it.

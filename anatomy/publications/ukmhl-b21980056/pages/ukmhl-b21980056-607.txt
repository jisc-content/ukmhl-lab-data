OF THE APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN. .593 The epidermis towards the orifice of the bulb is reflected on the hair, and is incorporated with its external surface. 2100. The nails, (iingues), arc those horny laminae cover- ing the backs of the extremities of the fingers and toes. A i nail is divided into the root, body, and free extremity: the root v.which is soft and white, is the posterior extremity of the nail, and i^s fixed into a groove of the dermis ; the body is the next part: oy its inner surface it is intimately joined to the dermis, which, (ex- ceept in the toes, where there are irregular papillae), here presents ongitudinal papillae separated by grooves into which a series of corresponding laminae, found on the inner surface of the body of tbhe nail, are received ; viewed externally, the posterior part of the oody of the nail is white and of a semi-lunar form, whence called Muida, the rest appears of a reddish colour, which is owing to this Dart of the nail's being transparent, and the dermis underneath very i7ascular; the free extremity of the nail is that part which projects liver the finger or toe. The epidermis at the root of the nail passes in towards the r^roove of the dermis into which the root of the nail is inserted, but iS soon reflected on the surface of the nail with which it is incor- worated; at the point of the finger or toe, likewise, the epidermis covering the skin under the free part of the nail, is reflected from bhe former to the inner surface of the latter, with which it is con- abunded.

The writer of this would fain believe his opinions to be correct, when he supposes that all this has greatly altered, and for the better, the general character of anatomical studies, and that there are few students now, who com- mence their professional career by calculating with how little anatomy they may practise surgery. He hopes also, and in this is confident, that excellent surgeons, instead of being rare and thinly scattered, will be found everywhere ; thus will surgery become more and more exact, and physic less and less conjectural. The writer has been accused of too forcibly influencing the student's mind, and of dragging it away from other collateral stu- dies as they are termed, to fix it exclusively on anatomical pursuits. Let others look to this. If anatomy be the basis of all medical education, as twenty years* active exer- cise of his profession has convinced the writer of this adver- tisement, beyond all doubt, it is reasonable to presume that it ought to be studied profoundly. It has never occur- red to him to meet with a surgeon or physician possess- ing a superfluity of anatomical knowledge, but, not un- frequently, to witness men at the summit of their pro- fession, renewing their anatomical knowledge, and prose- cuting anatomical inquiry, when far advanced in life. This he has seen even in Britain, but admits reluctantly, and with great regret, that it should occur more frequent- ly in foreign countries than at home. Finally, the writer cannot feel irritable or displeased, seeing that the medical and surgical student has unlimit- ed ly adopted his views ; neither is he uneasy at the efforts made to arrest the impulse given to anatomical studies : whether these flow from private or corporate malignity, the good sense of the professional public must always render them abortive ; and even should these ef- forts to depreciate anatomical knowledge, assume, under the very specious pretence of improving, extending, and amending medical education, a more formidable and more tangible shape, as it is said they speedily will, the writer.

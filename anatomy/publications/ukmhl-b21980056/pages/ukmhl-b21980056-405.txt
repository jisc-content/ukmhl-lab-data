This muscle is situated to the outside of the preceding, at the middle and anterior part of the sole of the foot; it is short thick, and of the form of a triangular prism. It arises by very distinct aponeurotic fibres, from the inferior surface of the os cu- boides, from the ligamentous sheath of the peroneus longus and from the posterior extremity of the third and fourth metatarsal bones, as well as from the ligaments by which they are connected. Increasing at first in size, and then diminishing, it proceeds from thence fonvards and inwards, is confounded with the outer portion of the preceding muscle, (1454), and, a Uttle farther on, with the transversus pedis (1453), to be attached along with them to the outer and under part of the first phalanx of the great toe, and its outer sesamoid bone, by an aponeurosis which occupies its interior surface. 1468. Its in/c'rio/-sicte covers the flexor longus digitorum, the accessorius muscle, the lumbriculcs, and the plantar aponeurosis.

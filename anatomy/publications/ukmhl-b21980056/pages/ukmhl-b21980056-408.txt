ACTIVE OIIGANS OF LOCOIMOTION. on the toes are bimilar to those which the interossei of the hand make the fingers perform (1245.) 1470. For the dissecfAun of the mnscles of the sole of the foot^ place the foot on its dorsal surface, iix it firmly to the table, and draw the toes from each other. Make an incision through the skin, along the sole of the foot from the heel to the roots of the toes, where a transverse one is to be made, from which others are to be drawn along the middle of the lower surfaces of the toes; these in- cisions being made, the dissector is now to proceed to dissect ofl* the flaps formed by them, in order to expose the plantar aponeu- rosis and the tendinous sheaths of the toes. Raise the thin aponeurosis from the inner and outer parts of the sole to show the abductors of the great and little toes; then cut across, very carefully, the middle part of the plantar aponeurosis about its middle, and dissect it forwards and backwards to show the flexor brevis digitorum. These three muscles being examined, they are to be cut through about the middle part of the foot, and their anterior parts dissected forwards, their posterior, backwards, to show the tendons of the tibialis posticus, flexor longus poUicis and flexor longus digitorum, with its accessory muscle. Cut through the tendons of the flexor longus digitorum, and examine the connexions of the lumbricales and the transversus pedis, also slit up the sheath, and examine the tendon of the peroneus longus. The remaining muscles, the flexor brevis pollicis, adductor pol- licis, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and the interossei are now to be isolated from each other by removing the cellular tissue connecting them.

ORGANS OF DIGESTION. 622 covered with a thicker and more abundant mucosity. It presents the rugae, lacunae, and orifices of follicles of which we have already spoken. Its villosities are not numerous, nor has it any valvulaj conniventes. 2211. No, intestine receives so many blood-vessels as the rectum in proportion to its volume. Its arteries come from the inferior mesenteric, hypogastric and internal pudic arteries. They are col- lectively designated by the name of HcBinorrhoidal Arteries, and are distinguished into superior, middle, and inferior. Its veins go partly to the hypogastric, and partly to the 'inferior meseraic. Its nerves come from the sciatic (1830) and hypogastric (1930) plexuses.* ARTICLE SECOND. ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. OF THE LUNGS. CONFOUMATION AND GENERAL IHSPOSITION, 2212. The Lungs {Fulmones)f are two spongy, cellular, ex- pansible organs, contained within the cavity of the thorax, separa- ted from each other by the mediastina and the heart, surrounded by membranes which are named pleurse, and destined to produce changes upon the air and blood which penetrate into them, on which is essentially founded the act of respiration. Although the lungs are to appearance separate and distinct, they are yet really connected with each other, since they receive the air by a single canal, and as the blood is transmitted to them by a single vessel. Their volume is not equal however, but on account of the projection of the diaphragm on the right side caused by the liver (1280), and the obliquity of the mediastinum to the left, the right lung is thicker than the left, which in its turn has a great- er vertical extent. The left lung is also a little smaller than the right. • According to the physiological order, we ought to describe here the organs of absorption: but as their study is considerably facilitated by that of the organs of circulation, we shall defer their examination until wc have described the latter. n»ii/(K«vsf of the Greeks.

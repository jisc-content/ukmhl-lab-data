Their circumference corresponds at the fore part to ithe anterior vertebral ligament, and at the back part to the poste- ; rior, contracting strong adhesions with their fibres ; it forms part Dof the intervertebral foramina, and in the back, contributes more- over to the formation of the small articular cavities which receive the head of the ribs. The intervertebral fibro-cartilages are formed in their circumfer- . ence by very close fibres, and laminje of the nature of ligaments ; the ,1 fibres never direct themselves perpendicularly from one vertebra to J another ; but the outermost ascend from left to right, and cover a a layer which has an opposite direction, and which is itself applied 1 against other layers having a different direction. The lamina, V which are concentric, are numerous anteriorly and laterally, but in 1 less number at the back part; they intersect each other, diminish i in thickness, and leave between them wider intervals, in proportion .i as they approach the centre of each fibro-cartilage. Their vacuities . are filled with a soft, pulpy, homogeneous viscid substance, of a : greyish colour; and at the centre itself there is only a very soft, - spongy, elastic, areolar tissue, plentifully supplied with the substance . in question : this disposition is much more apparent in the lumbar I region than in any other part of the vertebral column. In chil- i dren, this substance is whitish, transparent, and much less abun- ( dant than in adults, in whom it has more consistence and is of a ; yellowish colour. In old people, it diminishes still more in quanti- I ty, and the fibro-cartilages lose much of their thickness. These bodies when soaked in water, swell and increase very much i in their vertical extent, frequently acquiring a whole inch of thick- ness ; but it is especially towards the centre that the inci-ease is effected, and if one of them is cut horizontally between two verte- brae, each portion rises in the form of a cone having its base to- ward the external laminae of the fibro-cartilage, which acquire a red colour on remaining sometime in water. By desiccation, on the contrary, these organs are rendered much thinner, especially in the middle part, which is then reduced to a line of thickness. In the recent state the elasticity of these fibro-cartilages is ex- tremely remarkable, and restores to its direction the vertebral co- lumn after it has been variously bent in a dead body. If a verti- cal section is made of several vertebra;, the tissue of this body ex- pands and surpasses the level of the osseous surfaces. Their tena- city or power of cohesion is also very great, and even exceeds that ot the bones with which they are connected. ARTICULATIONS OF THIS ARTICULAR PROCESSES. â€¢599.

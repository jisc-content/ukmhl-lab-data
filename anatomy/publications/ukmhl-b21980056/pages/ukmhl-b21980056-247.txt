OF THE JIUSCLES IN GENKUAL. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVE ORGANS OF LOCO- MOTION, OR MYOLOGY. CHAPTER FIRST. OF THE MUSCLES AND THEIR APPENDAGES IN GENERAL. Of the Muscles. 775. The Muscles (Musculi)* are organs formed of long pa- rallel fibres, commonly of a red or reddish colour, soft, irritable, contractile, united into distinct fasciculi, varying in number and size, and themselves composed of subordinate fasciculi. 776. In the body of man, and the vertebrate animals in gene- ral, we find two classes of muscles. Some, which are internal, membraniform and hollow, are especially destined for the functions of nutrition and generation ; others, which are external, are more or less thick and solid, and subservient to what most physiologists call the animal functions. 777- The character by which the muscles of the latter order are essentially distinguished, is the faculty which they possess of con- tracting under the influence of the will, and of thus becoming the efficient cause of most of the motions performed in the animal body (16. I.) 778- The muscular or fleshy fibre, perceptible by the naked eye, has in general a prismatic or flattened, pentagonal or hexago- nal form, but is never cylindrical; its diameter varies little, and its length equals the entire interval between its two insertions. It is possessed of little elasticity, more or less red, bent in a zigzag manner in its longitudinal direction, varying extremely as to leno-th, firmer in adults than in children and old people, of the same'size m small as in large muscles, and passing through its course witli- out bifurcating or ramifying. It possesses little tenacity in the dead body, and is easily torn asunder; but, during life, it sustains very great efforts without breaking. It is itself composed of a great number of fibrils similar to each other, visible only by means of â€¢ M5,- from Mw,7^.

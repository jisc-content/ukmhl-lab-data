Sometimes tlie denticulations which form them have a contracted neciv : it is this tliat conbti- lutes the Dovetail Suture.—Ex, Sagittal Suture. At other times, on the contrary, the circumference of a bone presents but few inequahties, and is sloped to receive the neiglibouring bone: this is the Squamous Suture, in whicli the articular edges of the bones are fitted to each other, like the pieces of a multivalve shell.—Ex. The temporal suture. 2". Haumonia.* Here tlie surfaces are only in juxtaposition. They merely present rugosities, which are fitted to each other.—Ex.

Cortilages. The surfaces of the l)ones which form move- able articulations, are always covered with a layer of cartilage, mor^ or less thick, of a pearly white colour, and remarkably hard an(i elastic. This cartilage, which resembles a layer of wax laid over the bone at the place where it exists, is always much broader than it is thick; it adapts itself perfectly to the articulating parts, and adheres, by one of its surfaces, to the bony tissue in a manner as yet little understood, but extremely firm. There is, however, wv continuity of substance between it and the cartilaginous parenchy ma of the bones; for on removing, from a recent bone, by means of an acid, the phosphate of lime which it contains, there is per- ceived no intimate connexion between the tissues, and the cartilage then separates spontaneously. No vessel appears to pass directly from the interior of the bone to the surface of the cartilage; anc * 'AQuovja, adapia. f ro^ip&)ir/f; r^iiti^oii clavus. X 2;^;/»S£/X»(rif, calamiJissura. v.

The latter may permit pretty distinct motions, as is the case in particular wit the sterno-costal cartilages ; or are entirely fixed, as the articulations of the pelvi are, to which the name of xt/mphi/scs is peculiarly applied. The articulations whic are effected by means of ligaments, like that of the knee, arc called Si/nneuroses [2uv, cum; viv^ov, iicrvus, ligamenlum] those in which the bones are kept in placeb muscles, us is observed in the os hyoides, are called Syssarcoscs ; [Suv, cum; aa(. canA tliose in which membranes are emjiloyed, are called Mcningoses: \}>lnny\ vicmbrana] of which examples are presented in the skulls of children, at tlie place occupied by the fontanclles before the bones are completely ossified.

OEGANS OF SENSATION. 578 2045. The arteries of the internal ear come from the meningeal, stylo-mastoid, internal carotid and basilar arteries. The vestibule has a vein which throws itself into the sinus of the internal jugular vein, after traversing the substance of the petrous process by a small canal whose orifice is near that of the aqueduct. Some of these roots come from the semi-circular canals. The cochlea has another vein which issues from the internal scala near the aque- duct, traverses the petrous bone, and opens into the lateral sinus. We have described the acoustic nerve (1690), which is solely des- tined for the internal ear. ARTICLE THIRD. OF THE NOSE AND NASAL FOSSJE. OF THE NOSE IN GENERAL. 2046. The Nose {Nasus)* is a pyramidal eminence, which va- ries much in its form and dimensions. It is placed above the an- terior aperture of the nasal fossÂ£E (325), which it covers and pro- tects. It therefore occupies the middle and upper part of the face, between the forehead and upper lip, the orbits and the cheeks. Its lateral surfaces are separated from the cheeks by a semicircu- lar groove, and form, by their union, a kind of rounded line, more or less straight, and of variable length, which is named the back of the nose. This line is terminated by a prominent portion, named the lobe, beneath which are two apertures, (the nos- trils) separated by a partition which is continuous with that of the nasal fossae. Their form is oval, and they are always open. Their outer sides constitute the wings of the nose, and their partition loses itself in the upper lips, forming a small groove in its middle part. 2047. The more common direction of the nose is that of the me- dian line of the body. It is not at all rare to see individuals, how- ever, in whom it is more or less inclined to either side, whether this kind of deformity depends upon the bones, or only upon the soft parts. 2048.

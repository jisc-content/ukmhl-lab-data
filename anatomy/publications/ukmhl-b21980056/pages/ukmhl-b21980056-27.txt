15 SKELETON IN GENERAL. it is called the 'pericranium on the cartilages, the perichondria iim ,-t on the bones in general, the periosteum-X 39. The medullary canal of the long bones is lined by a thin, pellucid, vascular raembrane,§ folded upon itself a great many times, and divided into cellules or vesicles, by numerous prolonga- tions which extend from one of its sides to the other. It is filled with an oily inflammable juice, of a whitish or yellowish colour, which is fluid during life, and after death presents itself under the form of small shining grains. The substance has received the name of marrow, {medulla). 40. The cellular tissue of the extremities of the long bones, the diploe of the flat bones, and the interior of the short bones, is also Mned by a membrane, which appears to be nothing else than an expansion of vessels anastomosing ad infinitum with one ano- ther. This vascular network also furnishes a fat substance, re- sembhng the preceding, but having less consistence, and of a red- dish tint. 41. The medullary fluid does not occur solely in the large cavi- ty of the long bones and in the spongy tissue, but is also found in the interstices of the laminae of the compact tissue, and the poro- sities with which they seem perforated. || The sinuses and air-cells of the bones of the skull, however, do not contain any. OF THE SKELETON IN GENERAL. 42. The hard parts of the body taken collectively, bear the name of Skeleton, as we have already said. Almost all animals have a skeleton, but it does not exhibit the same arrangement in all. Of whatever nature it be, its object is to sustain the other organs: it forms the steady foundation on which is erected the whole edifice of the living machine, constituting a solid frame- .work, whose various parts, connected by flexible ligaments, are, at once, capable of moving on each other, and of resisting the effects of a foreign motion. It is on it that the general form of the body depends, as well as that of its various part.s; and it is by it that their proportions, figure, sohdity, and principal divisions are determined. 43. When the bones are connected by their own ligaments, the skeleton is called a natural one,t when, on the other hand, they • Hij;, cirra ; Kgav/«, calvaria. t H.-j,, circa ; 'X.ov^ot, cartilago. „ . t Ilsfj, circa; O^tiov, os. monJrnll>""«''''"^.K' '° ''^ ^^""^ '^l"''"'^' following preparation to de- S .V w. \ T^^ ^ ^•'"^ ''"'^ '"■'"^ "^^-^ the fire 0/ immerse it in an acid l)y which means the membrane is separated from the bone. ral" f„ l'^' ^''"^ t''^' f''" oi'y fl^W found here, is not natii.

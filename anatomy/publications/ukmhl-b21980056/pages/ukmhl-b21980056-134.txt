It consists of two bones, the Scapula and Clavicle. OF THE SCAPULA. 423. Form. The Scapula or Shoulder-blade, (Omoplata), is an irregular bone, situated at the posterior and upper part of the tho- rax, from about the seventh rib to the first, forming the posterior part of the shoulder, and loosely connected, by means of muscles, â– with the head, the ribs, and the spine. It has a triangular forniy

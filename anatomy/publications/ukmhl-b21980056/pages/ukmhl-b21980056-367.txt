MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. 353 MUSCLES OF THE PERINEUM. OF THE SPHINCTEK ANI. (Constrictor Ani.) 1299- This is an oval membraneous muscle which surrounds the anus. It is attached to the tip of the coccyx by a sort of cellular tendon, from which two fleshy bundles arise, which, passing round the sides of the anus, unite again before it to form a fleshy point which is partly confounded with the accelerator urinje, and part- ly expanded in the cellular tissue. The fibres of this muscle are concentric and semi-elliptical, and interlaced with each other in the median line, forming acute angles. In the female, its anterior portion is much more rounded than in the male. 1300. Its inferior surface is covered by the skin. The upper corresponds to the levator ani, from which it is almost every where separated by cellular tissue, but with which it is intimately con- founded near the rectum. Anteriorly, it also unites in part with the accelerator urinae and transversus perina?i. 1301. This muscle closes the anus, and wrinkles the surrounding skin. In the male, it draws the bulb of the urethra backwards. Genital Region. IN MAN. OF THE ERECTOR PENIS. {Ischio- Cavernosus.) 1302. This is a small elongated flat muscle, broader in the mid- dle than at its extremities, which surrounds the origin of the cor- pus cavernosum. Fixed to the inner side of the sciatic tuberosity, it ascends forwards and inwards, and degenerates into a white and strong aponeurosis, which is identified, beyond the level of the bulb of the urethra, with the fibrous membrane of the corpus ca- vernosum, over which it is applied by its outer surface, which moreover corresponds to the ramus of the ischium, while its inner surface is in connexion with the transversus perinasi and accelerator unnse, from which it is separated by much adipose cellular tissue, together with vessels and nerves. It draws the root of the penis downwards and backwards. 2 a

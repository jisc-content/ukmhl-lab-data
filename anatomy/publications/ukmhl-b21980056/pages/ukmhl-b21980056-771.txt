INJECTING OF THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 557 small, or happens in a part where but little of the injection can escape. " Another inconvenience may arise from the vessels being over distended, even where no rupture happens, more especially in the arteries, which, though it is not of equal importance with the for- mer, will be better avoided ; that is, when they are thus pretcrna- turally distended, they become elongated, and thrown into a ser- pentine form, which is apt to give a wrong idea of their natural appearance. " When injecting through a very small pipe, the injection will pass proportionably slow, as the resistance to the passage of the fluid will, of course, be greater; this resistance, from not consi- dermg the cause, has been supposed by some, not much experien- ced in the art, to be owing to an entire obstruction in the pipe, and thence they have desisted from forcing the piston, whilst the injection was passing with as much freedom as the pipe would ad- mit, and only required a little more time to fill the vessels complete- ly, and this circumstance should always be kept in remembrance, when small pipes are used. "If the part to be prepared is bvilky, and the vessels not so super- ficial as to be easily chilled, as entire subjects, large extremities, &c. it may be taken out of the hot water, and laid on a table, or in a dish ; but if it is thin and membraneous, or the vessels pass near the surface, the contact of cold air, or the coldness of the table, &c. on which it is laid, would be in danger of chilhng the injection in its passage, and greatly injure the preparation, and therefore should always be injected in hot water."* ARTICLE FOURTH. ORGANS OF ABSORPTION. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 276I. The Organs of Absorption are arranged into two per- fectly distinct orders. The Lymphatic or Absorbent vessels, and the Lymphatic Ganglia {Lym,phatic or Conglobate Glands). â€¢ Pole's Anatomical Instructor, p. c.

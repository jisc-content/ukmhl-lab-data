OF THIS ENVELOPES 01" THE TESTICLES. 80J 2964. Cutaneous Envelope of the Testicles. This is merely a prolongation of the skin of the inner part of the thiglis, the pc- rinteum, and penis. It is remarkable for its brown colour, always darker than tliat of the other parts of the skin, the numerous rugo- sities which it presents, especially when contracted, the great quan- tity of sebaceous follicles which it contains in its substance, and the scattered, long, and twisted hairs which arise from it in the adult. These hairs are inserted obliquely, and their bulbs produce distinct eminences at the surface. The scrotum is moreover divid- ed into two lateral portions by a prominent line, named the Raphe^* which runs from the anterior margin of the anus to the root of the penis. This first envelope of the testicles has the same organization as the skin in general, only its chorion is so thin, that the blood-vessels which creep in the dartos may easily be perceived through it. 2965. Of the Dartos. The Dartos are two cellulo-filamentous membranes, traversed by a vast quantity of vessels of all kinds, entirely destitute of fat, of a reddish tint, attached to the rami of the ossa pubis and ischii, whence they descend towards the raphe, to which they closely adhere. Above it they are reflected from beneath upwards, come into mutual contact, forming a septum, {Septum Scroti) and terminate at the lower part of the urethra, thus separating the two testicles from each other. Their outer surface adheres to the cutaneous envelope of the scrotum in the greater part of its extent. The inner corresponds to the fibrous coat, and adheres to it by some prolongations. It also covers the extremities of the cremaster muscle. The dartos appear entirely cellular, nor do they exhibit any ap- pearance of muscular fibres, although some authors would have them to be muscles. These membranes, are besides considerably strengthened by a thin and flat fibrous band, which proceeds from the upper and outer part of each inguinal ring. MM. Chaussier and F. Lobstein were of opinion that the dartos do not exist in the scrotum previous to the descent of the testicles, and Dr. Breschet has confirmed the assertion by recent re- searches.-|- 29G6. Of the Cremaster Muscle-l (Tunica Erythroides).ยง The Cremaster, which is very thin and often not easily distinguishable, is in a great measure a continuation of the fibres of the obliquus abdominis internus, which are attached to the anterior and superior iliac spine (1257). However it also seems to receive some fibres from the transversus muscle, and to be in part attached to the inner surface of Poupart's ligament near the inguinal ring, and to the neighbouring region of the pubes. Arising from these different points, its fasciculi collect towards the ring, form a small mass at the outer side of the sheath of the spermatic cord an.l pass out- โข V,i(pn, Siitura. f See Diet, des Sciences MaUcaks, T. viii. p. 10. t Kj.|Mli^ameidum su^pciisorium. ยง I'^ouO^a;, ruber ; ulo;, Jigura,

CLASS FIRST. ARTICLE FIRST. ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. 18. The really essential organ of motion is the fleshy or mus- cular fibre, which, by contracting under the influence of the will, enables the animal into the composition of whose body it enters, either to change its position in part, or altogether to remove from the place which it originally occupied. But in order that motions of this kind may be performed with the requisite precision, it is ne- cessary that the muscles should be attached to hard parts, within or without the body, to serve as levers, and afibrd fulcra to each other. Hence the very natural division of the apparatus of loco- motion into two kinds, the one consisting of the passive organs, the other of the active organs of this faculty. The bones and their appendages belong to the former, the muscles and the parts con- nected with them, to the latter.* DESCRIPTION OF THE PASSIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. CHAPTER FIRST.

ORGANS OF SENSATION. . HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS. i 1930. This plexus is formed by several filaments of the vesical^ uterine, vaginal, and haemorrhoidal nerves of the sciatic plexus (1833), by the end of the inferior mesenteric (1919) and aortic (1926) plexuses, and by a considerable number of the anterior lila- ments of the sacral ganglia; it sends its ramifications to the rec- tum, bladder, vesiculas seminales, uterus, vagina, and anus, along "with the arteries which go to be distributed to these parts. More- over, it also sends out of the pelvis, filaments which follow the ar- teries to the posterior region of the thigh. 1931. The last sacral ganglion emits from its inferior part fila- ments, which direct themselves inwards to the anterior sacro-coccy- geal ligament (623), where they unite with those of the opposite side, by means of a small ganglion, forming an arch whose con-* vexity is directed downwards, from which proceed some filaments which lose themselves on the anterior surface of the coccyx. OF THE ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSATION- ARTICLE FIRST. OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 1932. The Eyes, {Oculi),* are placed in the orbitar cavities, which we have already described, (342), while their appendages, (oculi tutamina. Hall.), occupy the circumference of these fossae, and consist of the eyebrows, eyehds, ciliae, Meibomian glands, &c. OF THE EYEEUOAVS. •' 1933. The Eyebrows (Supercilia), are two arclied eminences, convex above, differing in their degree of prominence, breadth, thickness, and elongation in different individuals, and generally laro-er in old people. They lie upon the superciliary arch of the frontal bone, (151), which forms their basis, extending above the eyelids, from the sides of the root of the nose to the temples. Their inner extremity is more prominent than the outer, which is slender « Op(aXf*is of tlio GiBoks.

IIIBS. SI is terminated by an oval surface for the reception of the cartilage, with which it is intimately connected. It is also softer than the other extremity, and presents a great number of vascular porosities. 89. The ribs are firm, elastic, and very hard ; their centre and I head are formed of cellular tissue, but the compact tissue which covers them has this peculiarity, that it seems formed of small scales, laid over each other and placed in layers. 90. These bones are developed by three points of ossification, one for the body, another for the tuberosity, and the third for the . head The epiphysis which is destined to form the tuberosity, is , of a lenticular form ; that of the dorsal extremity is a small angu- I lar plate. Both are still isolated at the age of eighteen or twenty. OF SOME PAllTICULAE RIBS. 91. The first, second, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, present pecu- liar characters, and deserve a separate description. 1st, The First Rib is shorter, broader, and thicker than the rest, has a transverse position, and is a Uttle curved from without inwards in the direction of its breadth. This rib presents on its upper surface, two furrows, corresponding to the sub-clavian ar- tery and vein, which are separated, near the inner edge, by an, impression to which the scalenus anticus muscle is attached. Its lower surface, which incHnes a little outwards, is shghtly convex, smooth, and destitute of a groove. Its inner edge is concave, thin, and sharp. The outer, which inclines a little downwards, is con- vex, thicker, and rounder, and presents the tuberosity. This rib has no angle. It also touches, with its two extre- mities, the horizontal plane on which it is placed. Its head is round, and presents only one articulating surface. Its neck is very slender and elongated. Its anterior extremity, which is broader and thicker than in the other ribs, sometimes affords insertion above to the sub-clavius muscle. 2d, The Second Rib, although much longer than the first, has nearly the same direction. Its outer surface which is convex, and turnea a little upwards, presents a tuherositxj of which the uneven part is not very distinct, and a scabrous impression into which the ZfZ "^TT-''^'''^y Its inner Tn-nr:. r'l T"^*'' ^"'^ t^^n^d downwards, and com I f?" ^'W"" ^"'y '^^"'â€¢^ behind.

PASSIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. 232 AUTieULATIONS OF THE PHALANGES OF THE TOES. 773- Their surfaces, ligaments, and synovial membranes are in all respects similar to those of the fingers, only the ligaments are a little smaller, on account of the inferior size of the bones themselves. PIIEPARATION OF LIGAMENTS. 774'. The ligaments are most conveniently dissected immediately after the muscles have been removed. When being dissected they are to be put on the stretch, and carefully freed from the sur- rounding cellular tissue; and as at their insertion into the bones, their fibres run into the periosteum, and are also continuous with neighbouring tendons, the dissector when making a ligamentous preparation must carefully distinguish how much is ligament, how much tendon, and liow much periosteum. Nothing has been said about macerating them; this, if possible, is to be avoided until the ligaments liave been fully isolated from the neighbouring parts. The preparation may be then put into water for a short time, for the purpose of facilitating the removal of the periosteum, and clean- ing the bone. Thin and infiltrated subjects are tlie best for ligamentous pre- parations.

241 OF THE MUSCLES. CLASSliaCATION Ol' THE MUSCLES. 790. Anatomists have successively introduced various modes of tlividing the muscles. Some, and in particular Winslow, have ar- rano-ed them according to their uses. Albinus, Sabatier, Boyer, and^Bichat, have arranged them according to the different parts of the body which they occupy, and each of these parts has received the name of rctjion. In the foUo^ving pages the muscles will be described in the order in which they should be dissected. CHAPTER SECOND. OF THE MUSCLES IN PARTICULAR. MUSCLES OF THE TRUNK. MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 800. Before describing the muscles of the back, it is neces- sary to speak of the Ligamentum nuchcB, which is a very elon- gated, narrow fibrous cord, formed of pretty close parallel fibres, which it is often very difficult to distinguish from the aponeu- iroses of the trapezius, attached to it. It arises from the se- venth cervical vertebra, and ascends between the trapezius, splenius and complexus, to be attached to the external occipital protuberance. From its anterior part, it furnishes a cellular pro- longation, which proceeds as far as the external occipital ridge, and to the .spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae; but this pro- longation is entirely destitute of fibres, and has the appearance of a septum which separates the posterior cervical muscles from each other. Posteriorly, this ligament lies directly vmder the skin. The first layer of muscles comprehends the Trapezius and La- (issimtis dor si. OF THE TllAPEZIUS OK CUCULLARIS. 801. The T, •apezius is a thin triangular muscle, situated at the posterior part of the neck and back, and at the upper part of the • shoulder. It arises from the inner third of the upper curved line of the occipital bone, from the whole length of the ligamentum

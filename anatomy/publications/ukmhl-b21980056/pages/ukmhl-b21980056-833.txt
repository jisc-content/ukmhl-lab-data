819 OF THE VULVA. from above downwards iind from behind forwards, embraces the ex- tremity of the corpus cavernosum, and is connected with it by ves- sels and a very dense cellular tissue. It is circumscribed by a prominent edge called the Corona Glandis, behind which the inner membrane of the prepuce forms a cul-de-sac by being reflected. Beneath the urethra, the corona glandis is interrupted by a small groove which extends to the orifice of that canal, and which is filled by the frfenum praeputii (2996). 3018. The glans is invested by the mucous membrane of the prepuce, which, over it, is thin, rather dry, destitute of mucous crypts, and covered by a very delicate epidermis. Its internal tis- sue is spongy, erectile, and of the same nature as that of the ure- thra, only it appears firmer and denser. ARTICLE SECOND. j. ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE FEMALE. 3019. The genital organs of the female form an apparatus at least as complicated as those of the male. Some of them are sub- servient to the act of copulation, such as the vulva, vagina, &c. ; others, the uterus and its appendages, are the seat of conception, and retain the product during a determinate time; while others, the mammae, are subservient to the nourishment of the child after birth. OF THE VULVA AND ITS APPENDAGES. 3020. The name of vulva (Pudendum) is now given to the external parts of generation in the female in general, although this denomination was formerly bestowed solely upon the fissure be- tween the labia, which leads to the vagina. The vulva is bounded anteriorly at the fore part of the pubes by a prominent surface covered with hair. This is the Mons Veneris. Posteriorly, it is only separated from the anus by an interval of an inch, to which the name of Perinceum is given. This interval is

ADVERTISEMENT. âœ“ About two years ago the Compiler of the following work caused to be translated, for the use of the gentlemen at- tending his anatomical lectures, the very excellent work of Mr. H. Cloquet, entitled, " Traite d'Anatomie De- scriptive;" in reality the best treatise of its kind, on the exact descriptive anatomy of the human body, ever offered to the public. There was this peculiarity in the work of M. Cloquet, or rather this in which it particu- larly differed from all, or from most British anatomical works, that it was really what its title declared it to be. The reasons why the writer of this advertisement troubled himself and the public with a translation of a work on anatomy written in a foreign language, were briefly and partly stated in a preface prefixed to that translation : nothing has occurred since to alter or modify the opinion stated therein; and the rapid sale and exhaustion of that work must convince, he thinks, every one that he had not miscalculated nor misjudged the wishes of the anatomical students of this kingdom. The sale of a thousand copies of a work addressed almost exclusively to one class of students, implies irresistibly, that perhaps more than two- thirds of all the anatomical students in Britain entertained opinions, similar to those on which the translator has, in his capacity of lecturer on human anatomy, more particu- larly insisted, as to the advantages of studying correct and positive anatomy, in preference to acquiring vague, imper- fect and inaccurate notions of structure.

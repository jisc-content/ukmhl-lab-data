804 ORGANS OF GENERATION, CLASS THIRD. ORGANS OF THE GENERATIVE FUNCTIONS. ARTICLE FIRST. ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE MALE. 2962. The organs of generation in the male are very numerous, and exhibit great differences as to situation, texture, and uses. Some of them, the testicles, secrete the seminal fluid ; others, the vesicular seminales, hold it; another, the penis, carries it into the organs of the female. Of the Testicles and their Appendages. OF THE ENVELOPES OF THE TESTICLES. 2963. These envelopes consist of five layers or coats, the cu- taneous envelope, the dartos, the cremaster muscle, the fibrous coat, and the tunica vaginalis, which, by their superposition, form a kind of bag, called Scrotum, * which is divided into two portions by an internal septum. Attached above to the pelvis, and free in every other direction, this bag is continuous laterally to the inner and upper part of the thighs ; anteriorly to the penis ; and posteriorly is separated from the anus by an interval of the extent of two or three fingers'" breadth, to which the name of Perinceum is given. It is loose and elono-ated in weak and old persons, after coition, and during the action of debilitating causes; drawn up and contracted upon the testicles in strong and vigorous men, and during cold weather. Its richt side is generally higher than the left: a circumstance which has not escaped the notice of painters and sculptors. * Or^ioy of the Greeks.

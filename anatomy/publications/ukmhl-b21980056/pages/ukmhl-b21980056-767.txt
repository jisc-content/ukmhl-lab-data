SYSTEM OF THE VENA I'ORTiE. Of the Coronary Veins of the Heart. RIGHT CORONAKY VEINS. 2751. Great Riglit Coronary Vein. It commences towards the summit of the heart by several radicles which anastomose with those of the small right coronary and of the left coronary veins. It then ascends in the adipose groove of the thick margin of the heart, accompanying a branch of the corresponding coronary ar- tery. It receives a gi-eat nvnnber of lateral twigs, turns over the blunt margin of the heart, passes into the groove which separates the auricles from the ventricles, becomes horizontal, and directs it- self to the right and upwards, 2752. Small Right Coronary Vein. It arises like the pre- ceding, passes into the groove of the posterior surface of the heart, receives the veins of that surface and of the septum of the ventri- cles, ascends, vertically upon the wall of the auricle, and unites with the preceding. LEFT CORONAIIY VEINS. 2753. They are much smaller than the right, and vary much in number. Tiiey commence along with the preceding at the summit of the heart, by several roots which unite upon the con- vex surface of that organ into two or three branches. These often collect into a single trunk which ascends vertically over the groove which separates the ventricles from the auricles, and opens along with the others at the posterior part of the right auricle, un- der the vena cava inferior. Of the System of the Vena Portce. ORIGIN OF THE VENA PORTjE. 2754. The Vena Porta derives its origin from all the organs contained in the cavity of the abdomen, excepting the kidneys and bladder, and the uterus in the female. But these origins unite to form two principal trunks, which are called the splenic and supe- rior mesenteric veins. 275.5. Splenic Vein {iiena splenica). It arises from the spleen by a number of branches varying from three or four to seven or eight, which, after a short course, unite upon the pancreas into a single trunk. Less flexuous than the artery which it accompanies, the splenic vein then directs itself transversely from left to right, â– and beneath it, before the pancreas, to unite witli the auporior inc- 3 c

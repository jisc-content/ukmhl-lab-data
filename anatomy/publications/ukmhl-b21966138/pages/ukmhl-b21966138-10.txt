THE GENERAL MODE IN WHICH THESE LECTURES WILL BE DISTIN- GUISHED FROM ALL OTHERS will be that, in consequence of this dependence of the Patholo- gical and Practical Course upon the Anatomical and Physiological, and by means of the simplicity of that arrangement which involves the details of both, Mr IValker will be enabled to deliver every thing that can be erf' the slightest use in Medicine or Surgery during this course of three months, while, at the same time, he places every thing, by the same means, in what seems to him, an incomparably simpler and far more intelligible point of view. It will indeed be the grand object of this as well as of the preced- ing course to teach both the science and the art of medicine at once more rapidly and more correctly than appears hitherto to have been attempted. Mr Walker does not hesitate to speak thus explicitly, because he will have the pleasure of demonstrating its correctness. - — \ ‘ r THE PARTICULAR MODE IN WHICH THESE LECTURES WILL BE DISTIN- GUISHED FROM ALL OTHERS will be that Medicine and Surgery will be intimately

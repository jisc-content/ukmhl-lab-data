11 Every other department of Medical Science may also be infinitely more easily studied in private than this individual part of it possibly can, because every other department of it is incomparably more independent of actual demonstration. In short, the utter impossibility of any Gentleman, who has not practised in this way, ever performing Surgical Ope- rations with precision and ease, is too obvious to be for a moment dwelt upon. Mr Walker thinks, that an exposition of the common errors, a clear explanation of a few original and fundamental principles, and especially of THE GREAT PRINCIPLES OFOPERA'IION PROPOSFD by him, and the actual performance of operations upon these principles, will decidedly effect these im- portant purposes. But to effect this, it is evident, that the peiv formance of one or two operations cannot suffice. Each Gentleman, therefore, attending this course, will have an opportunity of once performing one of the Great Operations, viz. Lithotomy, or Hernia (artificial Hernia, &c. being previously formed) ; of once performing Amputation; of twice Cutting down to and Tying Arteries, and of performing several of the smaller operations. The degree of experience which gentlemen will thus, from their own labours and the inspection of those pi others, even during the First Course, acquire, cannot Jail to be very complete.

15 CONVERSATIONS, among those Gentlemen also who choose to attend, in which each will have an opportunity of conversing with and examining another on the same subjects, will be held at the Lecture Room, every Saturday Morning, from Eleven- till Twelve o’clock. Neither these Examinations nor Conversations will require any additional fee. By these means; by means of the Private De- monstrations , after every difficult Lecture, (which will be given almost every evening, from Seven till Eight o’clock) and by means of the general plan of both Courses, so amply detailed, Mr tValker thinks it not derogatory to the character of Science to say, that he engages to render any gentleman, of reason- able application, perfectly versed in these Sciences du- ring two seasons of attendance ; and if, in that timet that object be not effected, HE WILL BE HAPPY TO COMPLETE IT BY PRIVATE INSTRUC- TION WITPIOUT EXPENCE TO THE PUPIL. In order also to facilitate the mode of study, and accelerate the progress of the pupil, a SYLLABUS, exhibiting the heads of each Lecture will be pub- lished. By means of it, the pupil may prepare him- self for every Lecture, or readily bring to recollec- tion whatever he may have heard. As this Syllabus also contains hints of every fact in Anatomy and Physiology, it will form the text-book of the Exa- minations and Conversations.

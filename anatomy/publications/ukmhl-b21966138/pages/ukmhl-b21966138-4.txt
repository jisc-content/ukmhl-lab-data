2 the important corresponding facts of Anatomy, ami succeeded by references to alt their applications, and particularly to those which are Pathological; in such a manner as at once to render obvious to the student the facts of Anatomy, to impress upon him the im- portant reasonings of Physiology, and to exhibit to him a view of a new, simple and impressive natural system of Pathological Science in general. As, in consequence of this general plan, Mr Walker will not introduce any Theory of Physiology until a clear and satisfactory Piezo has been given of the Facts of Anatomy on which it may depend, these lectures will be rendered easily comprehensible to the youngest student of General Science, as well as of Medicine. the particular arrangement OF THIS COURSE will be precisely the same with that which Mr Walker has proposed for Anatomy and Physiology in general. I. In that part of the Course which relates ta the Mechanical Organs and Functions, will! be explained the Structure and Uses, 1 st, Of thee Bones which support the rest of the animal machine . | 2dly, Of the Ligaments which unite it; and, 3%, Of the Muscles which move it.

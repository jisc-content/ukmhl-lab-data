3 II. In that part of the Course which relates to the Vital Organs and Functions, will be ex- plained the Structure and Uses, 1st, Of the Organs of Mastication, Deglutition, and Digestion, of the Absorbent Surfaces, and of the Vessels which absorb from these surfaces; Qdly, Of the Heart, Lungs, and Blood Vessels, which derive their contents (the blood) from the absorbed lymph ; and, 3dly, Of the Organs of Secretion, which separate various matters from the blood. Throughout this division, in particular, the analogies from vegetables will be explained. III. In that part of the Course which relates to the Intellectual Organs and Functions, will be explained the Structure and Uses, 1st, Of the Organs of Sense, which receive impressions from ex- ternal objects; Qdly, Of the Brain, where these im- pressions excite ideas; and, Sdly, Of the Spinal Marrow and Nerves, where volition results from the last. In this division will be also explained, as found- ed upon original observations, certain criteria of the various degrees of the sensitive, perceptive and vo- luntary powers possessed by different animals, as well as the nature of sensation, perception and vo- lition themselves. Throughout all these departments, Compara- tive Anatomy, as it alone can destroy Physiolo- gical Hypotheses, or transmute them into Theories, *ity be strictly attended to. t

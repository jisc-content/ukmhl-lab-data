In fine, it is because morbid anatomy &c. have not thus been combined with, and rendered the basis of Medicine, as now proposed, that the art is in its present backward state. IN ORDER TO RENDER SURGERY DEMONSTRATIVE, each Gentleman will actual- ly perform the operations which it involves. It cannot but excite astonishment that this, the only mode by which a facility in the performance of surgical operations can possibly be acquired, should never hitherto have been adopted in plans of public teaching. Mr Walker feels no inconsiderable pleasure in reflecting, that he first had the pleasure of thus ren- dering Surgical Lectures completely demonstrative or experimental; and that, during the present course, he shall have the honour of first rendering Medical Lectures equally so. No part of the Medical Art is at once so diffi- cult and so important as this : nor has any part of it hitherto been so strangely neglected. The Lecturer on Anatomy thinks this not his duty, because it is of too practical a nature ; and the Lecturer on Medi- cine thinks it not his, because actual demonstration is foreign to his business. Thus has a part, by far the most important of all Medical Science, been completely abandoned.

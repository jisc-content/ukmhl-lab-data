9 combined (for it is impossible to practice the one without a knowledge of the other), and both of THEM WILL BE RENDERED COMPLETELY DEMON- STRATIVE. IN ORDER TO RENDER MEDICINE DEMONSTRATIVE, Morbid Anatomy will con- stitute its basis, and all the reasonings connected with the theory of, or the practice applicable to any dis- ease will be most strictly founded upon those de- rangements of structure which actually take place, and which will be exhibited either in Morbid Prepa- rations, or in Drawings, Plates and Casts. Thus Medicine will, for the first time, BE TAUGHT BY ACTUAL DEMONSTRATION, INSTEAD OF VAGUE DESCRIPTION. Indeed it is only in this way that lectures on the Practice of Medicine can be of the slightest use. When not rendered thus demonstrative, books are evidently incomparably better, because they admit of repeated examination and can be recurred to when the hasty descriptions of a lecture cannot. As usually delivered, then, books are much to be preferred to such Lectures, because while the one con- tains as much as the other, the former may be refer- red to when the other cannot possibly be. On the other hand, Medicine rendered demonstrative by Morbid Preparations, Plates 8$c. admits of no sub- stitution.

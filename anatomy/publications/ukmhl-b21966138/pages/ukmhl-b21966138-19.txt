bine its facts, its arrangements and its language. 1 * com- PROSPECTUS OF THE ARCHIVES OF UNIVERSAL SCIENCE; To be Edited by ALEXANDER WALKER, Esq. lecturer ON PHYSIOLOGY, &c. And PUBLISHED QUARTERLY, (the 1st No. appearing iu January) by Sir Richard Phillips, No 6. Bridge Street, Blackfriars, London, and Messrs. Thomas Bryce <Sf Co. Infirmary Street, Edinburgh, and sold also by all Booksellers. THE utility of well conducted Periodical Publications is unquestionable. Those, however, which now exist, are, avowedly, confined to individual departments of Science, nor do they, either separately, or conjointly, extend to many of these. Chemistry and Natural Philpsophy, Medicine and Surgery, are almost the only subjects of them. It is certainly, there- fore, to be regretted, that Literature and the Fine Arts, Moral and Political Science, neither less generally interesting, nor less important in their nature, should remain unembraced by any or by all of them. The original papers, however, which even these limited Journals contain, are not always of the greatest value, and the criticisms which some of them involve, being always anonymous, they certainly may, with the less difficulty, serve either the purposes of undiscriminating friend- ship, or of deliberate malice, and become rather remarkable for confusing die views and ob- structing the advancement, than for illuminating the dark paths, and accelerating the progress of Science, The grand object of the work, now proposed, will be, by giving in detail all those subjects which other journals embrace, and by involving also all THOSE OTHER SUBJECTS OF SCIENCE WHICH THEY DO NOT EMBRACE,TO EXHIBIT, EITHER IN VALUABLE ORIGINAL COMMUNICATIONS, OR IN CRITICAL ANALYSES OF EVERY WORK CONTAINING NEW AND IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS, THE PROGRESS WHICH ALL THE SCIENCES AND ARTS ARE EVERY DAY MAKING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ; AND FURTHER, ALSO, BY ASSIGNING, TO EACH DISCOVERV, ITS PLACE IN A NATURAL ARRANGEMENT, TO APPRECIATE ITS VALUE, AND POINT OUT ITS INFLUENCE UPON THE SCIENCES, AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE ARTS. Tbs most striking also of the effects which this is intended to produce, is, as completely as possible to prevent the incalculable expence of obtaining, and the labour of perusing the immense number of pe- riodical and other works, which evpry day issue from the press ; while, at the same time, it places their contents in such a point of view as can only be exhibited by persons who are at once versed in all the Sciences. As certain general views, and especially such as refer to arrangement, must have the most extensive influence over the management of so vast an undertaking, the Editor will now, before the intended mode of publication is explained, rapidly sketch his views of these preliminary- subjects. 1 ment Many of the most important facts of Science are certainly slighted ; the processes of judee- : are too often neglected; and rational theory is almost entirely forgotten: curious trifles, falsely denominated philosophic ; flights of imagination, which please because they are peculiar and brilliant, but delusive hypotheses occupy their place. No arrangement is adopted in Science few of its inductions can be consistent; and from its facts no general theory can be established all its data are dispersed ; each must afford to individual caprice a new conclusion and . * one present a contradictory hypothesis. Even its language k not definite ; arrangement is sequently, in some measure, rendered useless, and truth remains too often unestablished • lC° ~ every thing, is rendered either arbitrary or vague; fruitless contests perpetually arise • error^nd confusion are propagated. 1 ’ na Thus, in my opinion, the facts, the arrangements, the theories and the laneua-re of are equally defective. a b 1 Lienee But let us, for a moment, consider its theories, because in them an attempt is made

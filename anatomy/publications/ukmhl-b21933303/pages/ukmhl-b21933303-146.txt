122 INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY. Mammaby. the subclavian. The middle thyroid vein crosses in front of the common carotid artery, and joins the internal jugular. Inteenal This artery arises from the subclavian opposite to the thyroid axis. It descends slightly inwards behind the clavicle and the subclavian vein, and enters the chest between the car- tilage of the first rib and the pleura. It then passes behind the costal cartilages about half an inch from the border of the sternum. Its further course will be examined in the dissection of the chest. The corre- sponding vein, which results from the union of the two vense comites, most fre- quently terminates in the brachio-cephalic vein. Superior . This artery Intebcostai. is given off by the subclavian behind the scalenus anticus on the right side, and to its inner side on the left, so that you must divide the muscle to see it. It enters the chest behind the pleura, to the outer side of the first dorsal ganglion of the sym- pathetic. It runs over the necks of the first and second ribs, and furnishes the arteries of the two upper inter- costal spaces, and a posterior branch which is distributed to the muscles of the back and the spinal cord. It usually inosculates with the first intercostal branch of the aorta. The corresponding DIAGEAM TO SHOW THE INOSCtTLATIONS OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ABTERT.

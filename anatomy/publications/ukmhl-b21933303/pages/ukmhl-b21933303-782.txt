758 LATERAL VENTRICLES. The anterior hom extends into the frontal lobe, and as it passes forwards it diverges slightly from its fellow of the opposite side. It is triangular in shape, its roof and anterior wall are formed by the corpus callosum, and it curves round the anterior extremity of the corpus striatum. The 2^osterior horn can be traced into the occipital lobe, where it passes at first backwards and outwards, and then, narrowing to a point, converges towards its fellow. Its roof is formed by the fibres of the corpus callosum as they pass backwards and outwards 1. Corpus callosum. 2. liateral veutriole. 8. Third Tentricle. 4. Corpus striivtum. 6. Thalamus opticus. 6. Corpus mammillare. 7. Choroid plexus. 8. Fornix. 9. Pituitary gland. from the splenium; on its floor are seen on the inner side an eminence, the hippocampus minor, and external to it a triangular flat surface, called the pes access&rius or eminentia collateralis} The middle or descending horn runs into the temporo-sphenoidal ' The posterior horns are not always equally developed in both hemispheres, and sometimes they are absent in one or both. In the carnivora, ruminantia, solipeda, pachydermata, and rodentia, the lateral ventricles are prolonged into the largely developed oKactory lobes. This is the case in the human foetus only at an early period.

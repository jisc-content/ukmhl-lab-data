1.55 DISSECTION OF TEE TIIOIUX. Before the several organs contained in the thorax are examined, the student shoukl have some knowledge of its framework. The ribs with their cartilages describe a series of arcs increasing in length from above downwards, and form, with the dorsal vertebrae behind and the sternum in front, a barrel of a conical shape, broader in the lateral than in the antero-posterior diameter. The spaces between the ribs are occupied by the intercostal muscles. In each intercostal space there are two layers of these muscles, arranged like the letter X. The fibres of the outer layer run obliquely from above downwards and forwards; those of the inner layer in the reverse direction. The base is closed in the recent state by a muscle—the diaphragm—which forms a muscular par- tition between the chest and the abdomen. This partition is arched upwards, so that it constitutes a vaulted floor for the chest, and by its capability of alternately falling and rising, it increases and diminishes the capacity of the thorax. In front, the diaphragm is attached to the ensiform cartilage, but it slopes posteriorly, to become attached to the last rib. The cir- cumference of the diaphragm is convex and muscular; in the centre it is flattened and aponeurotic. On the right side it corresponds, in front, with the upper border of the cartilage of the fifth rib; on the left side it corresponds with the upper border of the sixth rib. The upper opening of the osseous thorax is bounded posteriorly by the body of the first dorsal vertebra, laterally by the first ribs, and in front by the upper border of the manubrium sterni.^ ' That the student may have some knowledge of the diameters of the chest at different situations, the following measurements have been taken from a well- articulated male skeleton of the average height:—The antero-posterior diameter at the upper opening of the thorax is 2^ inches, at the articulation of the manubrium

402 STERNO-CLAVICULAR LIGAMENTS. that, collectively, tliey form for the joint a complete fibrous capsule of such strength that dislocation of it is rare. The Gosto-davimlar or rhomboid ligament connects the clavicle, to the cartilage of the first rib. It ascends obliquely outwards and backwards from the cartUage of the rib to a rough surface beneath the sternal end of the clavicle. Its use is to limit the elevation of the clavicle. There is such constant movement between the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib that a well-marked bursa is com- ]nonly found between them. Fig. 92. DUGE.\M OP THE STEKNO-CLAVICULAB LIGAMENTS. 1. Interclavicular ligament. 3. Costo-claviculor ligament. 2. Anterior sterno-clavicular ligament. 4. Interarticular fibro-cartilage. Interarticnlar fibro-cartilage. â€” To see this, cut through the rhomboid, the anterior and posterior ligaments of the joint, and raise the clavicle. It is nearly circular in form, and thicker at the circumference than the centre, in which there is sometimes a perforation, and divides the articulation into two cavities. Iii- feriorly, it is attached to the cartilage of the first rib, close to the sternum; superiorly, to the upper part of the clavicle and the interclavicular ligament. Its circumference is inseparably con- nected with the anterior and posterior ligaments.' ' Interarticular fibro-cartilages (menisci) also exist in the following joints : acromio-clavicular, temporo-maxillary, knee, and wrist .joints. Professor Hum- phry has shown that interarticular cartilages augment the variety of movements in a joint, permitting for instance that of rotation in the Icnee-joint, in addition to that of extension and flexion, which otherwise would be the only possible ones.

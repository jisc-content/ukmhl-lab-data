BRANCHES OF THE BRACHIAL ARTERY. 334 the arm, where it perforates the external intermuscular septum. It then descends deep in the interval between the brachialis anticus and supinator radii longus, and terminates in numerous ramifications, some of which pass in front of the external condyle, others behind it, to inosculate with the radial and interosseous recurrent arteries.

Before its division, the superior profunda sends several branches to the deltoid, coraco-brachialis, and the triceps, some of which inosculate with the circumflex. These assist in establishing a collateral cir- culation when the brachial artery is ligatured above the origin of the profunda. b. The 2^rofimda inferior arises from the brachial, opposite to the

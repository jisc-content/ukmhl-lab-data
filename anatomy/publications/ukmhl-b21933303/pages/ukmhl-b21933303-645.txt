621 PARTS CONCERNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. is separated from the vein by a similar, although a much -weaker partition, and there is a third close to the inner side of the vein. These three partitions not only keep all the parts in their right place, but confine the arch down to the bone, and prevent its being uplifted by any protrusion between it and the muscles and vessels. This, coupled with the close attachment of the fascia iliaca to the crural arch, explains why a femoral hernia rarely takes place in any other situation than on the inner side of the femoral vein.'

Sheath of the The femoral vessels descend beneath the crural Femoral Vessels, arch, enclosed in a funnel-shaped membranous sheath. This sheath appears to be derived immediately from the arch itself, but it is really formed in front by a prolongation from the fascia transversalis of the abdomen. This prolongation, uniting with the continuation from the fascia iliaca (to join the fascia lata) hehind the femoral vessels, forms a funnel, with the wide part ' If the partitions from any cause yield, or become slack, then a rupture may descend in front of the vessels, or even (though this is rare) on the outer side of the artery.

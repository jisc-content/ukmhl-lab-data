305 DISSECTION OF THE UPPEB EXTREMITY. The subject should be placed on its back, and, tlie thorax being raised by a block placed under tlie shoulders, the arm is to be ex- tended to a right angle with the trunk and blightly rotated out- wards. A narrow board must be placed lander the arm to keep it in position, and the hand, with the palm upwards, is to be firmly encircled by string to the board. SuBFACE Before commencing the dissection of the arm, Makkikg. the student should carefully examine with the eye and the finger the various inequalities of the surface of the skin, which are caused by, or are landmarks of, important subjacent structures. Beginning in the middle line, we notice a broad shallow groove in front of the sternum between the sternal origins of the pectoralis major; about two inches below the upper border of the sternum is a prominent transverse bony ridge (angulus sterni), which cor- responds to the junction of the first and second portions of the sternum. The clavicle may be easily traced, convex as to its sternal half, and concave in its outer half; not placed quite horizontally, but inclined upwards in the present position of the limb, and articula- ting externally with the prominent acromion process. Extending obliquely downwards and outwards, from the middle of the clavicle, is a groove, marking the separation between the contiguous borders of the deltoid and pectoralis major, and in which may, by deep pres- sure, be felt the coracoid process. Another groove, passing outwards from the stemo-clavicular joint, indicates the interval between the sternal and clavicular attachments of the pectoralis major. The upper arm below the acromion is rounded, the convexity being caused by the greater and lesser tuberosities of the humerus. In the more X

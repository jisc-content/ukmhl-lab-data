20 EXIT OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. The ninth, or glosso-pliariincjeal nerve passes tlirougli tlie jugular foramen in front of the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves. This nerve has a separate tube of dura mater and arachnoid, and lies in a groove in the lower border of the pars petrosa of the temporal bone together with the two succeeding nerves (fig. 8). Fig. 8. DIAGRAM SHOWING THE RELATIONS OF THE VESSELS AND NERVES PASSING THROUGH THE FORAMEN JUGULAKE. The tenih or jpneumogastric nerve emerges through the jugular foramen behind and rather internal to the glosso-pharyngeal. It is enclosed in a common sheath of dura mater with the spinal accessory, but is separated from it by a thin septum of arachnoid membrane. The eleventh or spinal accessory also passes through the foramen jugulare, lying behind the preceding nerve. The tivelfth or hypoglossal nerve passes through the anterior condylar foramen, piercing the dura mater by two fasciculi which unite external to the skull.' ' According to the classification adopted by Willis, the cranial nerves are arranged in nine pairs : the seventh including the facial and the auditory; the eighth comprising the glosso-pharyngeal, the pneumogastric, and the spinal acces- sory. The arrangement adopted in this handbook is that by Sommering.

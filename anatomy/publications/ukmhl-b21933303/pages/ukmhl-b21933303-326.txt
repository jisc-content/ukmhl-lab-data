302 COSTO-STERNAL LIGAMENTS. the upper border of tlie neck of the rib to the lower border of the transverse process above it. It is continuous externally with the aponeurosis covering the external intercostal muscle. The first and twelfth ribs have no anterior costo-transverse ligament (fig. 72). The middle costo-transverse ligament is an interosseous one, and connects the adjacent surfaces of the neck of the rib, and the trans- verse process. It is badly developed in the eleventh and twelfth ribs (fig. 73). The 2^osterior costo-transverse ligament passes from the apex of the transverse process to the summit of the tubercle of the rib. It is wanting in the eleventh and twelfth ribs (fig. 73). Fig. 73. DIAGRAM SHOWING THE LIGAMENTS CONNECTING THE EIB WITH THE VERTEBRA. 1. The anterior costo-oontral ligament. 2. Tlie interosseous, or middle costo-transverae ligament. 3. The posterior costo-transverse ligament. 4. The sj'uovial membrane between the rib and the body of the vertebra. Connection between the Caetilages of THE ElBS AND Steenum. The anterior extremities of the ribs are concave, and receive the cartilages of the ribs; this junction is maintained by the periosteum. The cartilages of all the true ribs are received into slight con- cavities on the side of the sternum, and are se- cured by anterior, ijosterior, iqyper, and lower ligaments. There is a synovial membrane between the cartilage of each rib and the sternum, except that of the first, and usually at each articulation the synovial membrane is separated into two by an interarticular ligament. The costal cartilages from the sixth to the tenth are connected by

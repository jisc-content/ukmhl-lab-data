825 VESTIBULE. consisting of tJiree semicircular canals ; it communicates externally with the tympanum by means of the fenestra ovalis and rotunda, and internally with the meatus auditorius internus. These cavities •are filled with a clear fluid, called the enclolymph, and contain a membranous expansion, the membranous lahyrinth, upon which the filaments of the' auditory nerve are expanded. The vestibule, or central chamber, is an irregular Vestibule oblong cavity, about one-fifth of an inch "in its widest part, which is at its antero-posterior and at its vertical diameters. On its outer wall is the fenestra ovalis, which is closed in the recent state by the base of the stapes ; on its inner wall, at Pia. 203. 1 1. The superior semicir- cular canal. 2.

(Two and a half times its natural size.) the front part, is a shallow round depression, the fovea heonisjjherica, which is perforated at its lower by numerous foramina, macula crih'osa, for the transmission of the filaments of the auditory nerve. Posteriorly, this pit is bounded by a ridge, the crista vestibuli, and in some subjects there is behind this eminence the opening of a small canal, called the aqticeductus vestibuli. It leads to the pos- terior surface of the pars petrosa, and transmits a small vein. In the roof is a transverse oval depression, the fovea hemi-elliptica, which lodges the utricle ; posteriorly, the five openings of the semi- circular canals open into it; and, in front, is a large opening through ■which it communicates with the scala vestibuli of the cochlea.

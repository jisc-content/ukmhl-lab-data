The internal hranches of the three upper sacral nerves are distributed to the multifidus spinge. The posterior branches of the fourth and fifth sacral nerves do not divide into external and internal branches, but form a loop, the lower one being joined with the coccygeal nerve.

The trapezius and latissimus dorsi, which form the first layer of muscles, must now be cleaned by putting them on the stretch, and reflecting the connective tissue which covers them ; they should then be dissected in the course of their fibres.

It extends from the spine of the occiput to the spines of all the cervical vertebroj, except the atlas; otherwise it would impede the free rotation of the head. In the giraffe this liga-

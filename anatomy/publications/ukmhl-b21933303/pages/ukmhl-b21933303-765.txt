CONVOLUTIONS OF THE CEREBRUM. 741 calcarine fissure, and runs parallel with it. It separates the superior and inferior occipito-temporal convolutions, and causes the eminentia collateralis in the descending horn of the lateral ventricle. The Mppocamixd fissure takes its origin in the posterior part of the gyrus fornicatus, and, passing downwards and forwards, it ends by forming the notch in the uncinate gyrus. It corresponds to the hippocampus major. Fig. 178. COXVOLtTIOKS AND FISSUEES OF THE JIEDLtN AND TENTORIAL SUBFACES OF EIGHT HEIIISPHEBE. c.c. Corpus caUosum. A.K. Ascendiug frontal convolution. A.i'.

(O5, Gyrus ocoipito-temporalis medialis. The irrcemneiis, or quadrate lobule (fig. 178, P.C.), is bounded in front by the calloso-marginal fissure, behind by the internal parieto-occipital fissure. It consists of numerous convolutions, and belongs to the parietal lobe. The cuneate lohile (fig. 178, c) is triangular in shape, and is situated between the converging internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures. It is part of the superior occipital convolution. The f/ijrus fornicatus (fig. 178, G.F.) begins in front of the locus

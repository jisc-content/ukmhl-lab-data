SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION. 261 •the superior maxillary nerve, as it crosses the spheno-maxillary fossa. Like other ganglia, it has three roots—a f^ensory, from the superior maxillary ; a motor, from the great petrosal branch of the facial; and a sympathetic, from the carotid plexus. Fig. G'2.

G-losso-pharyngeal n. giving off tym] anic branch. Its branches pass upwards to the orbit, doivnwards to the palate, imva/rds to the nose, and hachiuards to the pharynx, as follows:— a. Ascending branches.—These are very small, and run through the Bpheno-maxillary fissure to be distributed to the periosteum of tlie orbit.' ' Anatomists describe several branches ascending from the ganglion: one to join the sixth nerve (Bock); another to join the ophthalmic ganglion (Tiedemann); and, lastly, some to join the optic nerve through the ciliary branches (Hirzel).

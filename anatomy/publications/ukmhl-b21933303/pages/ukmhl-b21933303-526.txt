502 PELVIC VISCERA. tap the bladder from tlie rectum without going through the peri- toneum. In children the peritoneum comes down lower than it does in the adult, because the bladder in the child is not a pelvic viscus. The recto-vesical pouch is permanent. But there is another peritoneal pouch on the front part of the bladder, which is onlj- produced when the bladder is distended. To produce it, the bladder should be blown up through one of the ureters. The Fig. 116. DIAGEAM OF THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE PELVIC VISCEEA. bladder soon fills the pelvis, and then, rising into the abdomen, occasions the pouch between it and the abdominal wall. At first the pouch is shallow, but it gradually deepens as the bladder rises. If the bladder be distended half-way up to the umbilicus, which is commonly the case when it has to be tapped, we find that the bottom of the pouch would be about two inches from the symphysis pubis (fig. 116). Within this distance from the symphysis, the bladder may be tapped in the linea alba, without rist of wounding the peritoneum. Thus, the surgeon has the choice of two situations in which he may tap the bladderâ€”above the os pubis, or from the

The corpus callosum is now seen to be overlaid on each side by the gyrus fornicatus; the border is termed the labium cerebri, and the space between tha gyrus and the corpus callosum is called the ventricle of the corpus callosum. Now slice off the hemisphere down to the level of the corpus callosum, when a section is made of the white substance,- called the centrum ovale majus. The corpus callosum is now well exposed.

Corpus This stratum of white substance, consisting of Callosum. transverse commissural fibres, is the chief con- necting medium between the two hemispheres, and is called the great transverse commissure of the cerebrum; and moreover, on each side forms the roof of the lateral ventricles. Its surface is. slightly arched from before backwards ; it is about four inches long and one inch in its greatest breadth, which is behind. It is rather nearer to the front than to the back part of the brain, and

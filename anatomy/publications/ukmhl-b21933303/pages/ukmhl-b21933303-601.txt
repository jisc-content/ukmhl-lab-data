The lobes of the liver, five in number, are also seen on its under surface. The right lobe, much larger than the left, is separated from it by the longitudinal fissure on : its under aspect, and by the falciform ligament on its upper ? surface. Its superior surface is smooth and convex, somewhat t quadrilateral in shape; on the under surface it is marked by three r fissures—the transverse, and those for the gall-bladder and vena Fig. 136.

It has also on its under surface two shallow fossae: the k anterior (wnp-essio colica) is for the hepatic flexure of the colon; ;lthe posterior (imiy)-essio renalis) for the right kidney and the supra- ! renal capsule. • The left lobe is the smaller; its upper surface is smooth and ^convex, its lower is concave and rests on the stomach. The remaining lobes may be considered as forming parts of the iright lobe, and are the lobulus Spigelii, the lobulus caudatus, and ithe lobulus quadratus. The lobulus Sinrjdii is a prominent quadrilateral lobe, placed ^between the transverse fissure and the fissures for the ductus P P

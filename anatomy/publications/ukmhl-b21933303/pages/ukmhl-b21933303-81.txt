VIEW OF OPTIC AND LOWEE NEEVES OE DEBIT. This nerve, having passed through the optic foramen, proceeds forwards and a little ontwards for about an inch to the globe of the eye, which it enters on the nasal side of its axis. It pierces the sclerotic and choroid coats, and then expands to form the retina. The nerve is invested by a dense fibrous coat derived from the dura mater, and by a thin one from the arachnoid, both of which pass forwards as far as the sclerotic. At the optic foramen it is surrounded by the tendinous origins of the recti; in the rest of its course, by loose fat and by the ciliary nerves and arteries. It is pierced in its course through the orbit by the arteria centralis retinae which runs along with its vein in the middle of the nerve to the eyeball.' Ophthalmic This artery arises from the internal carotid, close Arteuy. by the anterior clinoid process. It enters the orbit through the optic foramen, outside and below the optic nerve; occasionally through the sphenoidal fissure. Its course in the orbit is remarkably tortuous. Situated at first on the outer side of the optic nerve, it soon crosses over it, and runs along the inner ' A small branch from Meckel's ganglion, ascending through the spheno-maxil- lary fissm-e, is described by Arnold as joining the optic nerve.

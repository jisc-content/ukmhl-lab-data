STRUCTTJEE OF THE EYELIDS. 31 vascular than the ocular, and it presents a number of minute papillce, which when enlarged and aggregated by inflammation give rise to the disease called ' granular lids.' The conjunctiva will be more fully described with the anatomy of the eye. The eyelashes (cilia) are placed in two or more rows along the edges of the tarsal cartilages. The eyelashes of the upper lid are longer and more numerous than in the lower ; and their convexity is directed downwards, while those of the lower lid present an opposite curve. The bulbs of the lashes are situated between the tarsal cartilage and the fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum. They are supplied with blood by the palpebral branches of the ophthalmic artery, which run parallel and close to the free borders of the lids beneath the orbicular muscle. Structure op The eyelids are composed of different tissues, ar- THB Eyelids. ranged in successive strata one beneath the other. They are—1, The shin; 2. The orbimlaris imlpehrarum; 3. The IJolpehral ligament, which extends from the margin of the orbit to the cartilage ; 4. The expanded tendon of the levator ]jalpehrce (in the upper lid only); 5. The tarsal cartilage; 6. A thin layer of fascia, in which are seen the blood-vessels; 7. The Meibomian glands, which lie embedded in the tarsal cartilage ; 8. Conjunctiva. These structures are severally connected by areolar tissue, which never contains fat. Such, in outline, is the structure of the eyelids. Their use is best described by Socrates, who, in answer to the question whether animals were made by chance or design, replies : ' Think you not that it looks like the work of forethought, because the sight is delicate, to guard it with eyelids as with shutters, which open when we want to see, and shut during sleep; and, that even winds may not hurt them, to make eyelashes in the lids for a sieve; and to furnish the parts over the eyes with eyebrows, as with eaves, so that even the sweat from off" the head may do them no mischief?'!

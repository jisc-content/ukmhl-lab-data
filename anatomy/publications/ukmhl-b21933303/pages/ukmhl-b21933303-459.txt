FASCIA TRANSVERSALIS. 435 should take place from below upwards, as the muscle is less in- timately connected with the fascia below than it is higher up. PasciaTraks- This fascia separates the transversalis muscle vEESALis. from the peritoneum, and is so called because it lies in contact- with the posterior surface of the muscle. It is com- paratively thin, superiorly, where it is continuous with the fascia on the under surface of the diaphragm. Inferiorly, it is thick and strong, and is attached to the crest of the ilium and to Poupart's Fig. 101. 1. Internal abdominal ring. 2.

About the middle of Poupart's ligament it sends a funnel-shaped prolongation downwards into the thigh, forming the anterior part of the sheath of the femoral vessels. Internally, it is connected with the margin of the rectus, to the lower margin of the conjoined tendon, to the os pubis, and to the pectineal line. This fascia is F F 2

MUSCLES OF THE BACK.- 288 are four in number, and are also arranged in pairs between tlie transverse processes. Their nerve-supply is derived from the internal posterior branches of the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar nerves. We have next to examine the muscles concerned in the move- ments of the head upon the first and second cervical vertebra3 (fig. 68). Fig. 68. DIUWINO FROM NATURE OP THE SUBOCCIPITAL TRIANGLE. 1 and 7. Complexus. 2. Hectug cap. posticus minor. 3. Rectus cap. posticus major. 4. Obliquus inferior. 5. Sterno-niastoid. G. Semispinalis colli. 8. Obliquus superior. 10. Pp'.enius. 11. Trachelo-mastoid. 12. Great occipital nerve. 13. Occipital artery giving off its descending brancliâ€”the princeps cervicis. 14. Suboccipital nerve. 15. Tliird cervical nerve (posterior branch). Eectus Capitis Posticus Major. This is a largely developed interspinal muscle. It arises by a small tendon from the well-marked spinous process of the second cervical vertebra, and, expanding con- siderably, is inserted into the inferior curved ridge of the occipital bone, and into the surface of bone below it. These recti muscles, as they ascend, one on each side, to their insertions, diverge and leave an interval between them in which are found the recti capitis postici minores.

412 THE WRIST-JOINT. When, from accident or disease, tliis fibro-cartilage gets de- tached from the radius, the consequence is an abnormal projection of the lower end of the ulna. The synovial membrane of this joint is distinct from that of the wrist, except in the case of a perforation through the fibro- cartilage. On account of its great looseness, necessary for the free rotation of the radius, it is called membrana sacciformis. The movement between the lower ends of the radius and ulna is due to the rotation of the radius round the articular head of the Fig. 95. 1. External lateral liga- ment. 2.

Eadio-Carpal This is an arthrodial joint, and is formed: above, OB Wrist-joint, by the lower end of the radius and the distal sur- face of the triangular fibro-cartilage ; below, by the scaphoid, semi- lunar and cuneiform bones ; the two former articulate with the two facets on the radius, the latter with the fibro-cartilage.

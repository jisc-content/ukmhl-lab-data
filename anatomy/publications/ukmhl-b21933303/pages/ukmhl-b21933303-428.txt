404 CONOID AND TRAPEZOID LIGAMENTS. trapezius, extends from, the upper surface of the acromion to the upper surface of the clavicle. The inferior acromio-clavicidar ligament, of less strength, ex- tends along the under surface of the joint from bone to bone. An interarticular fibro-cartilafje is sometimes found in this joint: but it is incomplete, and seldom extends lower than the upper half. There is only one synovial membrane. Goraco-clavicular ligament.—The clavicle is connected to the coracoid process of the scapula by two strong ligaments—the conoid and trapezoid, which, being continuous with each other, should be considered as one. The trapezoid ligament is the more anterior and external. Quadrilateral in shape, it arises from the (portions of tlie ooraoo- claviouliir ligament. 3. Suprascapular or trans- verse ligament. 4.

The conoid ligament, triangular in form, is situated behind the trapezoid ligament to the posterior border of which it is attached. It is fixed at its apex to the root of the coracoid process, ascends nearly vertically, and is attached by its base to the clavicle. The coraco-claAdcular liga- ments fix the scapula to the clavicle, and prevent undue rotation of the scapula. When the clavicle is fractured in the line of the attachment of the coraco-clavicular ligament, there is little or no displacement of the fractured ends, these being kept in place by the ligament.

304 PELVIC VISCERA IN THE FEMALE. run up to the ovary, between the layers of the broad ligament, the ovarian vessels, which arise from the aorta in the lumbar region, like the spermatic arteries in the male, because the ovaries are originally formed in the loins. On the anterior surface of the broad ligament,, on either side between its layers, is the round ligament of the uterus. This cord proceeds from the fundus of the uterus, anterior to the Fallopian tube, through the inguinal canal, like the spermatic cord in the Fig. 117. male, and terminates in the mons Veneris. Besides one or two small blood-vessels, it contains muscular fibres analogous to those of the uterus ; these increase very much in pregnancy, so that, about the full term, the cord becomes nearly as thick as the end of the little finger. In early life, the round ligament receives a cover- ing from the peritoneum,- which advances in a tubular form into the inguinal canal. It corresponds to the processus vaginalis of

The two anterior ligaments consist of a superficial and a deep portion: the sujyerftcial is a rounded ligament passing from the tubercle of the atlas to the base of the odontoid process; the deejj passes as a membranous layer from the anterior arch of the atlas to the body of the axis. The posterior ligament extends from the posterior arch of the atlas to the upper border of the lamina of the axis. The capsular ligaments are thin loose ligamentous sacs connect- ing the borders of the articular surfaces. The transverse ligament (fig. 71) passes transversely behind the odontoid process, and is attached to the tubercles on the inner sides of the articular processes of the atlas. From the centre of this ligament a few fibi-es pass upwards, to be attached to the basilar process, and some downwards to the body of the axis, giving it a cruciform appearance. Thus it forms with the atlas a ring, into which the odontoid process is received. If this transverse ligament be divided, vve observe that the odontoid process is covered with cartilage in front and behind, and is provided with two synovial membranes. The ribs articulate by their heads with the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae; by their necks and tubercles with the transverse pro- cesses of the vertebrae, and by their cartilages with the sternum in front.

380 STRUCTURES COVERED liY THE DELTOID, Fig. 87. Action of the It raises the arm; but it cannot do so beyond Deltoid. an angle of ninety degrees. The elevation of the arm beyond this angle is effected through the raising of the shoulder by the trapezius and serratus magnus. Its anterior fibres draw the arm forwards ; its posterior, backwards. This powerful muscle is sup- plied with blood by the anterior and posterior circumflex, the thor- acica humeraria, the thoracica acro- mialis, all from the .axillary artery; also by the deltoid branch of the brachial. Its nerve is the circum- flex. The rotundity of the shoulder is due, not so much to the deltoid as to the upper end of the humerus. When the head of the humerus is dislocated into the axilla, the fibres of the muscle run vertically to their insertion ; hence the flattening of the deltoid, and the greater pro- minence of the acromion. It is below the deltoid that an ununited fracture of the humerus is most commonly met with, owing to the muscle displacing the upper fragment. Reflect the deltoid from its origin, and turn it JDlSSJSCTIONa • * downwards. Observe the ramifications of the cir- cumflex nerve and the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries on ■ its under surface; notice also the large bursa between it and the tendons inserted into the great tuberosity of the humerus. Pakts coveeed The structures seen on reflecting the deltoid are BY THE Deltoid. as follows : the bursa already alluded to, the cora- coid process, the coraco-acromial ligament, the origins of the biceps and coraco-brachialis, the insertions of the pectoralis minor and major, the long head of the biceps, the insertions of the supra- spinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor, the long and external analysis of the deltoid.

533 POSITION OF THE BLADDER. variation. When contracted, the bladder sinks into the pelvis behind the pnbic arch, and is completely protected from injury. But, as it gradually distends, it rises out of the pelvis into the abdomen, and, in cases of extreme distension, may reach up to the inubilicus.' Its outline can then be easily felt through the walls of the abdomen. The form ^ of the distended bladder is oval, and its long axis, if prolonged, would pass superiorly through the um- bilicus, and inferiorly through the end of the coccyx. The axis of a child's bladder is more vertical than that of the adult â€¢ for in Fig. 128. 1. Ureter. 2. Vas deferens. 3. Vesicula semimli= 4. Trigone. 5. Prostate. POSTEEIOB VIEW Or THE BLADDBE. children the bladder is not a pelvic viscus. This makes lithotomy in them so much more difficult. ' When the bladder is comijletely paralysed it becomes like an inorganic sac, and there seems to be no limit to its distension. Hall found, in a drunkard, the bladder so dilated that it would hold twenty pints of water. (Elem. Phys. art. Vesica.) Frank saw a bladder so distended as to resemble ascites, and evacuated from it twelve pounds of urine. (Oratio da Signis Morbormn, &c. &c. Tieini, 1788.) W. Hunter, in his Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus, has given the representation of a bladder distended nearly as high as the ensiform cartilage. ^ In all animals with a bladder, the younger the animal the more elongated is the bladder. This is indicative of its original derivation from a tube, i.e. the urachus. In the infant, the bladder is of a pyriform shape, as it is, permanently, in the quadruped; but as we assume more and more the perpendicular attitude, the weight of the urine gradually makes the lower port more capacious.

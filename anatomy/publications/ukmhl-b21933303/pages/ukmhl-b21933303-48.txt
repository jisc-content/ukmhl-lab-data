24 DISSECTION OF TPIE FACE. inner side of the artery in the upper -park of the cavernous sinus constitute the cavernous plexus, which is in communication with the third, the fourth, and the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerves, and gives a branch to the lenticular ganglion in the orbit. On removing the Gasserian ganglion, three small nerves are seen lying on the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the tem- poral bone. One, the large superfidal petrosal nerve, enters the hiatus Fallopii to join the facial; the second, immediately exter- nal to the preceding, is the small superficial petrosal^ which passes from the facial to join the otic ganglion; the third, the ext&rnal superficial petrosal nerve (not always present), passes from the facial to communicate with the sympathetic on the middle menin- geal artery. DISSECTION OF THE FACE. Much practice is required to make a good dissection of the face, and it is well, therefore, to dissect this part before the skin and subjacent structures get dry and discoloured. The muscles of expression are numerous and complicated; they are interwoven with the subcutaneous tissue and closely united to the skin : their fibres are often pale and indistinct. The face is largely supplied with motor and sensory nerves, of which the rami- fications extend far and wide. Therefore you must not be dis- couraged if, in a first attempt, you faU to make a satisfactory display of the parts. The cheeks and nostrils should be distended with horse-hair, and the lips sewn together. Make an incision down the mesial line of the face; another from the chin along the base of the lower jaw to the angle; then prolong it, in front of the ear, to the zygoma. Eeflect the skin from below upwards. Each muscle, to be properly cleaned, should be put on the stretch by hooks. The student is recommended to make out the muscles and arteries on the one side, leaving the other side for the display of the nerves.

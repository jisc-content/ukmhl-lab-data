AUDITORY NERVE. 835 enter the inembranous zone to be connected with the inner hair-cells of the organ of Corti.' The vessels which supply the cochlea are from ten to twelve in number, and are derived from the auditory artery; they, like the nerves, enter the bony canals of the modiolus, and then turn out- wards to ramify upon the osseous zone, supplying its periosteum. The plexus formed by these branches communicates with a vessel known as the vas spirale, which runs longitudinally in the liga- . mentum spirale to the outer attachment of the membrana basilaris. ' The veins from the cochlea terminate in the superior petrosal sinus, having previously joined those of the vestibule and semicircular I canals. ' Some anatomists describe filaments as passing between the rods of Corti to I end in the outer hair-cells. 1 3 H 2

444 CONGENITAL INGUINAL HERNIiE. 1. The skin and superficial fascia. 2. The intercohcmnar fascia. 3. The conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis. 4. The fascia transversalis. 5. The subperitoneal fat and the peritoneum. A direct hernia, as has been said, emerges through Hesselbach's triangle, and if this triangle be viewed from its deeper aspect, it will be seen that, usually, the obliterated hypogastric artery- corresponds in its course to the deep epigastric artery. Occa- sionally, however, it is placed further inwards, so that it divides the triangle into two smaller ones, in both of which there is a shallow pouching of peritoneum. Now, if a direct hernia protrudes through the outer of these two smaller triangles, it descends Fia. 102. 4 VAKIETIES OF CONGENITAL INGUINAL HEENIiE, CONSEQUENT UPON SOME DEFECT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPEBMATIC POETION OP THE TUNICA VAGINALIS.

In almost all cases, the immediate investment of the intestine is the parietal layer of the peritoneum. This constitutes the sac of the hernia. The opening of the sac, communicating with the abdomen, is called its mouth; then comes the narrow, constricted portion, or neck; and lastly, the hodjij, or expanded part of the sac. Congenital Owing to the comparatively late descent of the HEHNiiE. testis in foetal life, it frequently happens that

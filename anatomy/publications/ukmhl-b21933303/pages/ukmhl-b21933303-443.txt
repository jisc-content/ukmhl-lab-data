419 DISSECTION OF TEE ABDOMEN. Sotface The body should be sufficiently raised by placing Mabking. blocks beneath, tlie buttocks and tke skoulders, care being taken to have the chest higher than the pelvis. In the middle line, extending from the ensiform cartilage to the symphysis pubis, is a groove caused by the linea alba, the line of union of the aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles. In this middle line, nearer the os pubis than the ensiform cartilage, is the umbilicus, wliich corresponds as a rule with the body of the third lumbar ver- tebra. The recti muscles can be distinguished on each side of the middle line, and in well-developed subjects with little fat, the linese transversae may be recognised, the lowest one being at the uimbilicus, the highest on a level with the ensiform cartilage, and the third one midway between the two. On the outer border of the rectus, about three inches from the middle line, is a concave line, the linea semi- lunaris, corresponding to the separation of the aponeurosis of the abdominal muscles to form the sheath of the rectus. Above, and external to the spine of the os pubis, the external abdominal ring can be easily felt, the outer pillar being the stronger; on it rests the spermatic cord passing to the testis. Passing from the spine of the OS pubis to the anterior superior spine of the ilium, is a crescentic groove which indicates the line of Poupart's ligament, and which can be felt as a firm and slightly curved cord; at about half an inch above the middle of the ligament is situated the internal abdominal ring, which cannot, however, be felt. Arbitkaey The abdomen is divided into arbitrary regions. Division into that the situation of the viscera contained in it Eegions. jj^j^y -jjQ more easily described. For this purpose we draw the following lines :â€”one horizontally across the abdomen on a level with the cartilages of the ninth ribs; another on a level E E 2

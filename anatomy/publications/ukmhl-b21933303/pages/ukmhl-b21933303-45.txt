NERVES PASSING THROUGH CAVERNOUS SINUS. 21 We must now examine the cavernous sinus, and ^ISS£CTION* • - the nerves which course along its walls to the orbit—namely, the third, the fourth, the ophthalmic division of the fifth and the sixth nerves. Cavernous This sinus (fig. 6) lies by the side of the body Sinus. of the sphenoid bone. In front it receives the ophthalmic vein, which passes backwards through the sphenoidal fissure ; while posteriorly it divides into the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses, which have been already described ; on the inner side it communicates with the circular sinus, which surrounds the pituitary body (P in the diagram 6). The interior of the sinus is remarkable for the numerous fine bands of reticular tissue which interlace in all directions. In the outer wall of the cavernous sinus we trace, from above downwards, the third nerve, the fourth, and the ophthalmic division Fig. 9.

On its inner wall are situated the internal carotid artery with the sixth nerve below and to its outer side. These structures are not actually within the sinus so as to be bathed by the blood, for they are separated from it by the lining membrane of the sinus (fig. 9).

Just be/ore entering the sphenoidal fissure, the fourth nerve (on its way to the orbital surface of the superior oblique) gets above the third, which here divides into an upper and a lower branch (botli pi'oceedmg to the ocular surface of the muscles they supply); lower still, we have

STRUCTUKE OF THE KIDNEY. 592 this portion of the tube is termed the s^nral tubule (Schachowa). The tubule now enters the medullary portion, narrowing verv sud- denly in its calibre, and descends towards the apex of the pyramid constituting the descendinr/ limb of Renle's loop (3). The tubule here bends upon itself, forming a loop, the loop of Ilenle, and ascends to Fig. 140. 1. Malpighian capsule. 2. First or proximal con- voluted tubule. 2''.

On passing out of the medullary ray of the cortical portion, the tubule becomes irregu- larly dilated, and takes the name of the irrer/ular tubule (5) ; this is continued on into another convoluted portion, called the second of distal convoluted tubule (2''), which, before entering the straight tube,

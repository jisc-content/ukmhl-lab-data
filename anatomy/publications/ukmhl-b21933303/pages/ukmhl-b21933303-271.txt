247 INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. or singing, the glottis assumes what is called the vocalising posi- tion—that is, the opening becomes narrower, and its edges nearly- parallel. Ventricles of These are the recesses between the upper and THE Laei-nx. lower vocal corda, and each leads to a small conical pouch,^ the sacculus laryngis. Each ascends for about half an inch, as high as the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, which bounds it on its outer side, while on the inner side is the upper vocal cord. It contains from sixty to seventy muciparous glands. Over its inner and upper part is a layer of muscular tissue, com'p-essor sacculi laryngis of Hilton (aryteno-epiglottideus inferior), which connects it with the aryteno-epiglottic fold ; on its outer side is the upper part of the thyro-arytenoideus. Intrinsic There are eleven muscles which act upon the Muscles of the larynx : five on each side and one in the mid- die. The five pairs are—the crico-thyroidei, the crico-arytenoidei postici, the crico-arytenoidei laterales, the thyro- arytenoidei, and the aryteno-epiglottidei. The single one is the arytenoideus.

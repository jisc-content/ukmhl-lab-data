OLFACTORY NERVES. 277 explain the relief frequently afforded by lia3morrliage from tlie nose in cases of cerebral congestion. The mucous membrane of the nose is supplied with sensory ^lerves by the fifth pair. Thus, its roof is supplied by filaments from the external division of the nasal branch of the ophthalmic, and from the Vidian; its outer wall, by filaments from the superior nasal branches of the spheno-palatine ganglion, from the nasal, from the inner branch of the anterior dental, and from the inferior nasal branches of the large palatine nerve; its septtim, by the septal branch of the nasal nerve, by the nasal branches of the spheno-palatine ganglion, by the naso-palatine, and by the Vidian ; its jlom', by the naso-palatine, and the inferior nasal branches of the large palatine nerve. Olfactory The olfactory nerves, proceeding from each olfac- Nekves. tory bulb, in number about twenty on each side, pass through the foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. In its passage each nerve is invested with a coat derived from the dura mater. They are arranged into an inner, a middle, and an outer set. The septal, which are the largest, traverse the grooves in the upper third of the septum. The middle ramify on the roof of the nose. The outer pass through grooves, and are divided into an anterior and a posterior group : the anterior being- distributed over the superior turbinated bone, the posterior over the OS planum of the ethmoid and the middle turbinated bone. The nerves descend obliquely between the mucous membrane and the periosteum, and break up into filaments, which communi- cate freely with one another, and form minute plexuses with small elongated intervals. Microscopically, the filaments differ from the other cerebral nerves, in containing no white substance of Schwann, and in their axis-cylinders being provided with a very distinct nucleated sheath with fewer nuclei and at longer intervals.

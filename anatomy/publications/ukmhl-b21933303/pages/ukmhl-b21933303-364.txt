340 CUTANEOUS VEINS AND NERVES OF THE FOREARM. beyond the wrist-joint, a transverse furrow, which corresponds with the border of the annular ligament. ^ Proloncr the incision down to the wrist, and, at Dissection. . . . , , <iu its termination, make another transversely. Re- flect the skin, and dissect the subcutaneous veins and nerves. Cdtaneocs On inner side is the anterior ulnar vein, "Veins. which commences on the front of the wrist, and is then continued upwards on the inner side of the forearm as far as the elbow, where it is joined by the posterior ulnar vein to form the common ulnar vein. This vein communicates with the median vein by numerous branches (p. 826). The veins on the back of the hand commence at the extremi- ties of the fingers, run up between the knuckles, and unite on the back of the hand, forming an arch with its concavity upwards. The posterior ulnar vein arises from this arch by a branch (vena salvatella) situated over the fourth interosseous space, and runs up on the back of the forearm, towards the inner condyle, to join the anterior ulnar vein. The radial vein, situated on the outer side of the forearm, com- mences on the back of the hand from the venous arch, runs up the radial side of the front of the forearm to the elbow, where, after receiving the median cephalic, it becomes the cephalic vein. Running up in front of the middle of the forearm is the median vein ; it communicates in the forearm with the radial and ante- rior ulnar veins, and near the bend of the elbow it is joined by a deep branch—mediana profunda—after which it divides into two branches, an outer or median cephalia, which joins the cephaUc, and an inner or median basilic, which joins the basilic (fig. 80). Cutaneous radial side of the forearm, as low down Nerves. as the wrist, are found the terminal filaments of the anterior branch of the musculo-cutaneous nerve, which, about the middle of the forearm, sends a posterior branch backwards to supply the posterior and lower part of the forearm as low as the wrist, communicating with the radial and external cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral. At the lower part of the front of the forearm, one or more of these filaments are situated over the radial artery, and one branch passes to the palm to supply

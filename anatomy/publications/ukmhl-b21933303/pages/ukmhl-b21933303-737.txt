INTER-METATARSAL ARTICULATIONS. 713 4. Between tlie inner cuneiform bone and tlie metatarsal bone of the great toe. 5. Between tbe scaphoid and the three cuneiform bones, and between these and the adjoining bones (the great toe excepted). 6. Between the os cuboides and the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. The tarso-metatarsal articulations are arthrodial joints. Fig. 169. DIAGBAII OF THE AETICULATIONS OF THE TABSUS AND THE TAItSO-METATABSUS. 1. Posterior oalcaiieo-astragaloid synovial cavity. 2. Calcaneo-scaphoid synovial cavity. 3. Calcaneo-cuboid synovial cavity. 4. Synovial cavity between metatarsal bone of great toe, and internal cuneiform boue. 5. Common scapho-cuueiform, intercuneiform, and metatarso-cimeiform synovial ca- vity. 6. Cubo-metatarsal synovial cavity. Inter-meta- TAESAL AkTICU- LATIONS. The metatarsal bones are connected at their proximal and distal ends by dorsal and plantar ligaments; those at the proximal extremities are very strong, and are supplemented by interosseous ligaments, as in the metacarpus (p. 416). The movement between the I i proximal ends of the inter-metatarsal articulations is arthrodial or || gliding. â€¢ ^ The distal extremities of the metatarsal bones are united by a It transverse metatarsal lirjament: this extends from the great toe to It the little toe on their plantar surfaces.

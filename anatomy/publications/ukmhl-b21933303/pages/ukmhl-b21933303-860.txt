836 DISSJEGTION OF THE MAMMARY GLAND. The form, size, position, and other external cliaracters of the mammary gland in the female vary more or less in different persons. The longest diameter of the gland is in a direction upwards and outwards towards the axilla; its thickest part is at the centre, and the fulness and roundness of the gland depend upon the amount of fat about it. Its deep surface is flattened in adaptation to the pectoral muscle, to which it is firmly connected by an abundance of areolar tissue. In its vertical direction the breast corresponds to the space between the third and sixth or seventh ribs; in its lateral direction, to the space between the side of the sternum and the axilla, while the nipple corresponds to the fourth rib, or a little below it. It is enclosed by a fascia, which not only supports it as a whole, but penetrates into its intei'ior, so as to form a framework for its several lobes ; hence it is that, in cases of mammary abscess, the matter is apt to be circumscribed, not diffused. The nip2yle (mammilla) projects a little below the centre; it is surrounded by a coloured circle, termed the areola ; this circle is of a rose-pink colour in virgins, but in those who have borne children of a dark brown. It begins to enlarge and grow darker about the second or third month of pregnancy, and these changes continue till parttirition. The areola is abundantly provided with papilla, and with subcutaneous sebaceous glands, to lubricate the surface during lactation; the areola as well as the nipple is destitute of fat. The gland itself consists of distinct lobes held Structure. together by firm connective tissue, and provided with separate lactiferous ducts. Each lobe divides and subdivides

The arteria sacra media, which is given off at the bifurcation of the aorta, supplies the fifth lumbar artery and, running down m front of the sacrum, supplies the rectum and other structures. By some aliatomists the branches are arranged in two classes â€”those destined to supply the viscera, and those to supply the abdominal parietes: the former, are the coeliac axis, supra-renal, renal, spermatic, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries; the latter are the phrenic, the lumbar, and sacra media arteries.

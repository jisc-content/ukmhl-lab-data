579 STKUCTURE OF THE LIVER. marked out by septa of areolar tissue, and in a transverse section Lave the appearance of mosaic pavement ('fig. 137) ; but in a per- pendicular section they somewhat resemble an oak leaf (fig. 138). Each lobule is mapped out by, and separated from, the adjacent lobules by delicate connective tissue, in which runs a plexus of vessels—interlohidar jdexus—consisting of branches of the portal vein. From this plexus passes inwards into the lobule a fine capillary network, whose branches converge to the centre of the lobule and end in a single vein, the intralolndar vein, which, in its Fig. 137. a.

The lobules themselves consist of a minute plexus of blood-vessels, ducts, and cells—hepatic cells—which latter fill up the spaces between the ramifications of the vessels. Iji. will facilitate the un- derstanding of the diflferent hepatic vessels, if it be borne in mind, (1) that the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic duct ramify f together from first to last, enclosed in a common sheath of con- t nective tissue, called Glisson's capsule ; (2) that the hepatic veins r run alone from first to last, and terminate in the inferior vena cava as it passes under the liver. p p 2

FOURTH VENTRICLE. 772 The anterior wall is diamond-shaped, pointed above and below, while laterally the space broadens out into an angular point, be- tween the cerebellum and the medulla, called the lateral recess. Below, the ventricle is bounded by the restiform bodies and poste- rior pyramids diverging like the branches of the letter V to form the inferior peduncles of the cerebellum; the divergence of these cords, with the median furrow, was called by the older anatomists the calamus scriptorius, from its fancied resemblance to a writing pen. At the termination of the posterior pyramid there is a slight overhanging thickening, turning over the restiform body at the Fig. 190. ■fl. Processus a cerebello ad cerebrum. 6. Restiform bodies. c.

PLOOB OF THE FOURTH VENTBICLE. lateral recess, of which it forms the lateral boundary; it is called the licjnla or tcenia. We find also a similar thickening, partly of the lining membrane and partly of nerve-matter, arching over the apex of the calamus scriptorius, known as the obex} The floor, formed by the posterior surface of the medulla and pons, is marked by a median groove jjassing from the apex of the calamus scriptorius to the iter. It is divided into two portions, a lower and an upper, by some transverse white fibres called the strice acusticce or meckilla/)'es, which emerge from the median groove and pass outwards over the inferior cerebellar peduncle to join part ' Obex, a bar.

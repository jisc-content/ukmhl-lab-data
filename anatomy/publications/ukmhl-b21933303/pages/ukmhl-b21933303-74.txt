DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 50 roof sliould be turned forwards and downwards and kept in this position by liooks ; the remainder is to be removed by bone forceps nearly as far as the optic foramen, so as to leave a ring of bone from which most of the ocular muscles have their origin. The eyeball should be made tense by blowing air through a blowpipe passed well into the globe through the cranial end of the optic nerve. Periosteum of The roof being removed we expose the fibrous THE Okbit. membrane which lines the walls of the orbit. It is a continuation of the dura mater through the sphenoidal fissure. Traced forwards, we find that it is loosely connected to the walls of the orbit, and that at the margin of the orbit it divides into two layers, one of which is continuous with the periosteum of the fore- liead, the other forms the broad tarsal ligament which fixes the tarsal cartilage. The periosteum is now to be removed, and the fascia of the orbit made out. The following objects should then be carefully Fio. 19.

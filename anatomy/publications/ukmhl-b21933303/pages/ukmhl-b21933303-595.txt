FALLOPIAN TUBES. 571 I The tmicous membrane of the uterus is more delicate and -nfter than that of the vagina, with which it is continuous, and - closely united to the subjacent tissue. The greater part of it > lined by a columnar ciliated epithelium, but that which lines he lower part of tlie cervix is squamous, like that of the vagina. Ixamined with a lens, the mucous membrane lining the body of he uterus is seen to be covered with minute follicles or tubes lerine glands) arranged at right angles to its surface. These abes pass outwards in a more or less spiral manner, some of them appearing branched and dilated at their extremities. They become .2;reatly developed shortly after impregnation, and take an impor- 3ant part in the formation of the membrana decidua. The arrangement of the mucous membrane in the cervix has been already described (p. 569), when the uterus was laid open to expose its cavity. Fallopiah The Fallopian tubes or oviducts are situated, one 'tTubes. on each side, along the upper free- border of, and inclosed by, the broad ligament of the uterus, and convey the ovum Fig. 135.

They are about four dnches in length: one end, the ostium internum, opens by a minute orifice into the . upper angle of the cavity of the uterus; the other

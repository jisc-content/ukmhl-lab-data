THE CORNEA. 797 is nearly circular in shape, its diameter being nearly half an inch, and its thickness about-^ig-th of an inch. The curve of the cornea forms part of a smaller circle than that of the sclerotic, so that it projects further forwards, varying in this respect in different eyes, and at different ages of life. It is firmly connected at its margin to the sclerotic, with the fibres of which it is continuous. The margin of the sclerotic is bevelled on the inside ; that of the cornea on the outside, so that the former overlaps the latter (fig. 198). To examine the cornea, it should be removed with the sclerotic Fig. 198. Liloid membrane â–  ina (dotted line) r roid coat (black Lie) inrotic coat . , Cornea. Iris. Ciliary processes.

This should be done under water, by making a circular cut with scissors, about a quarter of an inch from the margin of the cornea. With a little care it will be easy to remove the outer coat of the eye without injuring the dark choroid coat, the ciliary muscle, or the iris. In the loose brown-coloured connective tissue between the sclerotic and the choroid are the ciliary nerves passing- forwards to the iris; their white colour makes them very. con- spicuous on the dark ground. The cornea consists of four layers, which are not all composed of the same kind of tissue; they Structure.

This tissue never contains fat. There are some points of surgical interest concern- ing it:â€”1. Its looseness accounts for the extensive effusions of blood which one often sees after injuries of the head. 2. It admits of large flaps of the scalp being detached from the skull- cap ; but these flaps rarely slough, unless severely damaged, because they carry their blood-vessels with them. 3. In phleg- monous erysipelas of the scalp, the connective tissue becomes infiltrated with pus and sloughs; hence the necessity of making- incisions : for the scalp will not lose its vitality, and liberate the sloughs like the skin of other parts under similar conditions.

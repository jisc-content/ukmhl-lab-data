DIAGKAM or POUPABt'S LIGAIIENT, OF THE APONEUROSIS OF THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE, AND OF THE EXTERNAL ABDOMINAL RING. This ligament, when not separated from its fascial connections, does not run straight from the spine of the ilium to that of the os pubis, but is slightly curved, with its convexity towards the thigh. Above, and somewhat to the outer side of the spine of the os pubis, is situated an opening in the aponeurosis, called the external ' This was first described by Fallopius, an Italian anatomist, in his Ohscrva- tiones AnatomiccB, published in 1661.

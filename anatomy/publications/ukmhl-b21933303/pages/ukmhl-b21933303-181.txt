157 DISSECTION OF THE THORAX, soKdity and elasticity they protect the important organs contained in the thorax ; 2ndly, by their alternate expansion and contraction they act as mechanical powers of respiration. Tor they can in- crease the capacity of the chest in three directions : in height, by the descent of the diaphragm; in width, by the rotation of the ribs; and in depth, by the elevation of the sternnm. The chest of the female differs from that of the male in the follomng points:—Its general capacity is less : the sternum is shorter; the upper opening is larger in proportion to the lower; the upper ribs are more moveable, and therefore permit a greater enlargement of the chest at its upper part, in adaptation to the condition of the abdomen during pregnancy. The upper opening of the thorax gives passage to the trachea, the oesophagus, the large vessels of- the head and neck and upper extremities, viz., the innominate, the left carotid and subclavian arteries, with the left innominate and right subclavian and internal jugular veins, the superior intercostal and internal mammary arteries, the inferior thyroid veins, the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid and longus colli muscles of each side, the pneumogastric, the left recurrent laryngeal, the phrenic and the sympathetic nerves; the cardiac branches of the sympathetic, and the cardiac branches of the pneumogastric; also ' to the anterior branch of the first dorsal nerve as it passes up to join the brachial plexus, the thoracic duct, the thymus gland (in early life), and, lastly, to the apices of the lungs, which, with their pleural coverings, rise up on each side into the neck for about one inch and a half above the first rib ; the interspaces between these various structures being occupied by a dense fibro-cellular tissue, continuous with the deep cervical fascia. The diaphrag-m, which forms the base of the thorax, is pierced by the following foramina:—the aortic opening, for the passage of the aorta, vena azygos major, thoracic duct; the cesophageal opening for the oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and oesophageal branch of the coronaria ventriculi artery; the foramen quaclratum, for the vena cava inferior, a branch of the right phrenic nerve and lym- phatics from the liver ; the right cms transmits the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves; the left cms, in addition, transmits the vena

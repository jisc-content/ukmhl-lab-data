494 SYMPATHETIC IN THE ABDOMEN. and, the external pudic; between tlie lower intercostals and the lumbar arteries and the epigastric artery. Sympathetic The general plan upon which the sympathetic Nerve. nerve is arranged has been noticed in the dissec- tion of the neck (p. 151). The lumbar portion of it must now be examined. The lumbar portion of the sympathetic descends on each side in front of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, along the inner border of the psoas. The nerve has an oval ganglion of greyish colour, opposite each lumbar vertebra, so that there are either four or five of them on each side. These ganglia are connected together by small filaments of a white colour, and each ganglion receives, on its outer side, two branches from the corresponding spinal nerve, as in the chest; other branches pass inwards, and form in front of the aorta—the aortic 2^sxii-s ; and some pass downwards over the com- mon iliac arteries to form the hypogastric plexus. SoLAB Plexus The solar or epicjastric plexus is situated in front AND THE Sesii- of the aorta, and surrounds the coeliac axis in a LUNAR Ganglia. dense network of nerve filaments, in which are several ganglia. It receives the great splanchnic nerves, part of the lesser splanchnic, and some branches from the pneumogastric nerves. The solar plexus gives off filaments which form plexuses surrounding the various branches of the abdominal aorta, and are as follows:— Diaphragmatic. Supra-renal. Coeliac. Eenal. Gastric. Spermatic. Hepatic. Superior mesenteric. Splenic. Inferior mesenteric. Hypogastric. The diaphragmatic plexus is derived from the upper part of the semilunar ganglion, and is larger on the right than on the left side. It joins with some filaments of the phrenic nerve, and, whUst in relation with the supra-renal body, it gives oflF some branches to it. The right plexus has a small ganglion in it—cliaphragviatic ganglion —and sends ofi" filaments to the vena cava inferior and to the hepatic plexus.

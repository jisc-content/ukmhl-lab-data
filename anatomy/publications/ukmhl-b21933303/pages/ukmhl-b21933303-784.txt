760 FIFTH VENTRICLE. of the corpus callosum. It becomes narrower behind, tapering to a thin point, where the corpus callosum and the fornix become continuous. The septum consists of two layers, which enclose a space called the fifth ventricle or the ventricle of the septum (fig. 185). Each layer consists of grey matter inside and of white matter outside; the former representing the cortical, the latter the medullary substance of the brain. The cavity is not lined with epithelium, as is the case with those ventricles developed from the cerebral vesicles.' Fig. 187. DIAGRAM OF THE FOHXIX.

Cut transversely through the corpus callosum about its middle, with the septum lucidum, and turn forwards the anterior half. In this way the ventricle of the septum will be exposed. By turning back the posterior half of the corpus callosum a view is obtained of the fornix. This proceeding requires care, or the fornix will be ' The development of the septum lucidum commences about the fifth month of foetal life, and proceeds from before backwards, pari passu with, the corpus callosum and the fornix. It is developed from the lower part of the great longitudinal fissure, but becomes shut off from it in the jDrocess of development.

CONTENTS OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE. 73 the sides are defined by the hind border of the sterno-mastoid, and the front border of the trapezius. The omo-hyoid muscle, which crosses the neck under the sterno-mastoid, subdivides these primary triangles into four smaller ones (fig. 25) of unequal size : an anterior superior, an anterior in- ferior, a posterior superior, and a posterior inferior.

The Tbiangle. following muscles will be seen forming its floor: viz., beginning from above, the splenius capitis, the levator anguli scapulaa, the scalenus medius and posticus, and a small portion of the serratus magnus. The posterior belly of the omo-hyoid crosses this triangle about an inch above the clavicle, and subdivides it into two unequal parts—an upper or occipital, and a lower or siupra- clavicular. In the occipital triangle, the larger of the two, besides

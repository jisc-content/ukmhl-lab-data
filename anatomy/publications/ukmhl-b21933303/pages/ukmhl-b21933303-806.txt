782 SPINAL VEINS.' 4. The -posterior lonrjiiudinal sinnal veins, like the anterior, run along the whole length of the spinal canal. They form a tortuous venous plexus, situated inside the vertebral arches, and communi- cate in front with the anterior longitudinal veins by cross branches at frequent intervals, and externally with the vertebral, intercostal lumbar, and sacral veins by branches through the intervertebral foramina. The anterior and posterior longitudinal spinal veins are situ- ated between the spinal canal and the dura mater of the spinal cord, and are called the meningo-rachidian veins. 6. The medulli-spinal or proper veins of the spinal cord lie within the dura mater. They form a fine plexiform arrangement 1. Anterior external veins. 2. Dorsi-spinal veins. 3.

This complicated system of veins discharges itself through the intervertebral foramina in the several regions of the spine, as follows :—In the cervical, into the vertebral veins; in the dorsal, into the intercostal veins; in the lumbar, into the lumbar veins. None are provided with valves: hence they are liable to become congested in diseases of the spine. The membranes of the spinal cord, though the same in number and continuous with those of the brain, differ from them in certain respects, and require separate notice. ^ The dura mater of the cord is a touffh fibrous Dura Mater. p i i • i t membrane, like that of the brain, but does not i

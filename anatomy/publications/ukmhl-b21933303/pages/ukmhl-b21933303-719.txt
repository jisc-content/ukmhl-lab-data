SACRO-ILIAC LIGAMENTS. 695 The fOsteHor sacro-iliac lic/ament is composed of fibres much stronger and more marked, which pass behind the articulation. It consists of two portions : the upper, or horizontal, extends from the upper two transverse tubercles of the sacrum, and is attached to the rough surface of the ilium above the auricular surface; the lower, or oblique, is a well-marked fasciculus of fibres, the olMque saGro-iliac ligament, passing from the posterior superior spine to the third segment of the sacrum. Sacko-sciatic These are two strong ligaments passing from LiGAMEXTs, the sacrum to the ischium. Fig. 161. Great sacro - sciatic ligament. . . . Lesser sacro - sciatic ligament. . . . Ilio-femoral or acces- sory ligament oÂ£ the hip-joiut. The great sacro-sciatie ligament is triangular and thick; but narrower in' the middle than at either extremity. Its base is broad, and is attached to the posterior inferior iliac spine, and to the sides of the sacrum and coccyx; rapidly narrowing, it descends obliquely outwards towards the tuberosity of the ischium, where it again expands to be attached to the inner margin of this bone. This attached portion is continued upwards for some distance as a prolongation, the falciform process, into the inner margin of the ramus of the ischium, where it becomes continuous with the obturator fascia, forming a protection for the pudic vessels and nerve.

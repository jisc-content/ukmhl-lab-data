Observe that it is thickest and strongest at that part of the spine where it has the greatest weight to support—namely, in the lumbar region ; and that its thickness gradually decreases towards the top of the spine. It arises by thick tendinous fibres from the spinous processes of the two or three lowest dorsal and of all the lumbar vertebrae, from the spines of the sacrum, from the supra-spinous ligament, from the posterior fifth of the inner lip of the crest of the ilium, from the lower and back part of the sacrum, and from the posterior sacro- iliac ligament. From this extensive origin the muscular fibres ascend, at first as a single mass. Near the last rib, this mass divides into two: an outer, called the ilio-costalis or sacvo- lumbalis ; an inner, the longissimus dorsi. These two portions should be followed up the back ; and there is no difficulty in doing so, because the division is indicated by a longitudinal groove, in which we observe the ex- ternal cutaneous branches of the in- tercostal vessels and nerves. iLio-cosTAiis OB Traclug the ilio-cos- Saceo-ltjmbalis. talis or sacro-hmhalis upwards, we find that it terminates in a series of tendons which are in- serted into the angles of the six lower ribs.

INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 135 c. The vieningea parva (not marked in the plan) ascends through tlie foramen ovale into the skull, and supplies chiefly the ganglion of the fifth cranial nerve. It often comes from the meningea media. d. The inferioo- dental artery descends behind the neck of the jaw to the dental foramen, Avhich it enters with the dental nerve. It then proceeds through a canal in the diploe to the symphysis, where it minutely inosculates ^vith its fellow. In this canal, which runs beneath the roots of all the teeth, the artery gives branches which, ascend through the little foramina in the fangs, and supply the pulp in their interior. Opposite the foramen mentale arises the mental branch already de- scribed (p. 49). Before entering the dental foramen the artery furnishes a small branch—mylo-hyoid—which accompanies the nerve proceeding to the mylo-hyoid muscle. Fig. 34. Third stage. Second stage. First stage. PLAN OF raiEKNAL MAXILLABY AETEEY. Branches in e. The masseteric branch passes through the sigmoid THE Second Pabt. notch of the jaw behind the temporal muscle to the under surface of the masseter, with the masseteric nerve, and inoscu- lates with the facial and transverse facial arteries. f. The anterior and posterior deep temporal arteries ascend to supply the temporal muscle, ramifying between the muscle and the bone, one near the front, the other near the posterior border of the muscle. They communicate with the superficial and middle temporal arteries, with the terminal branches of the lachrymal a., and with the temporal branches of the ai-teria meningea media.

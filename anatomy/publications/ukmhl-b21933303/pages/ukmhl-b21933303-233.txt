209 THE HEART. runs in the anterior inter-ventricular groove, and tlien, passing into the glands between the aorta and trachea, opens into the right lymphatic duct: other smaller lymphatics pass into the thoracic duct. The newes are derived from the cardiac plexuses, which have been already described, p. 195. FiBBous EiNGs What may be termed the fibrous skeleton of OF THE Heart. the heart, consists of four rings, which surround, respectively, the four orifices at its base: namely,the two auriculo- ventricular, the aortic, and the pulmonary. These rings give Fig. 49. Mitral Talve DIAGRAM OF THE RELATIVE POSITION OP THE VALVES OF THE HEART, SEEN FROM ABOVE. A is placed on the triangular interval where the fibrous skeleton is the thickest. attachment by their external circumference to the muscular fibres of the heart, and from their internal circumference send fibrous prolongations to form the framework of the several valves. The skeleton is strongest just in the triangular interspace between the aortic and the two auriculo-ventricular orifices (letter A in fig. 49). In some animals, as in the ox and the elephant, there is here an irregularly triangular bone, known as the os cordis. The relative position of these rings is best seen by removing the auricles and the great vessels at the base of the heartâ€”leaving the several valves, and looking at them from above, as shown in P

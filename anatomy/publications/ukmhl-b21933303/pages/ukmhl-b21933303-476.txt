COURSE OF THE LARGE INTESTINE. 452 this point, it is continued as the ascending colon. We find it some- what smaller than the caacura, and it ascends through the right lumbar region in front of the right kidney as high as the under surface of the liver, where it abruptly makes a bend to the left sideâ€”the hepatic flexure of the colon : it then crosses the umbilical region transversely from right to left, and is known as the h-ans- verse colon. Beaching the left hypochondriac region, it makes a sharp bend downwards beneath the lower border of the spleen, forming the splenic flexure of the colon;' thence it descends in front of the left kidney,^ through the left lumbar region into the left iliac, as the descending colon. In the iliac fossa the intestine. Fig. 104. HEIiATIVE POSITION OF THE KIDNEYS AND THE LAEGE INTESTINE SEEK FEOM BEHIND. L. K. Left kiduey. A. c. Ascending colon, n. K.

Lastly, the bowel enters the pelvis on the left side of the sacrum, and here takes the name of rectum. This term, so far as the fossa by a fold of peritoneum or a rneso-cacum. 1 have seen this fold suffi- ciently loose to allow the caput coli to travel over to the left iliac fossa. ' This transverse part of the colon, in some instances, makes a coil behind the stomach to the diaphragm; such a state of things, -when the bowel happens to be distended, is apt to give rise to symptoms of diseased heart. See some observa- tions in point by Dr. Copland, in Land. Med. Gaz. 1847, vol. v. p. 660. = The contiguity of the ascending, and descending colon to the right and left kidney respectively, explains the occasional bursting of renal abscesses into the intestinal canal.

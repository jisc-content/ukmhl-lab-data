DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL COED. To examine, in situ, the spinal cord covered with its mem- branes, the arches of the vertebras must be sawn through, and removed. It is then noticed that the cord does not occupy the whole cavity of the spinal canal. The dura mater does not adhere to the vertebras, and does not form their internal periosteum, as in the skull. Between the bones and this membrane, a space inter-

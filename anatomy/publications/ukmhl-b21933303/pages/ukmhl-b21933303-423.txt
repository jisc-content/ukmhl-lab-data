Thus there are seven in all: four of which, situated on the back of the hand, are called dorsal; the remainder, seen only in the palm, are called palmar.' They are all supplied by the ulnar nerve.

From this double origin the fibres converge to a tendon, which passes between the meta- FiG. 90. Fig. 91.

The first dorsal interosseous muscle (abductor indicis) is larger than the others, and occupies the interval between the thumb and fore-finger. It aris(is from the proximal half of the ulnar side of the first metacarpal bone, and from the entire length of the radial side of the second: between the two origins, the radial artery ' If we consider the adductor pollicis as a palmar interosseous muscle, there would be four palmar and four dorsalâ€”aU supplied by the ulnar nerve.

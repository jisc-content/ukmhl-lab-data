ORItrlNS OF THE CRANIAL NERVES. 751 Frora this origin its fibres run upwards, backwurds, and inwards to the floor of the fourth ventricle, and wind round the nucleus of the sixth, so as to course superficial to it in the fasciculus teres. The nerve then makes a sharp bend upon itself, and passes downwards and outwards through the pons between the superior olivary nucleus and the ascending root of the fifth nerve. A small separate fascicvilus of this nerve—-pai's intermedia—lies between it and the auditory nerve, and forms connections with both; it arises from the lateral column of the cord. The nerve enters the meatus auditorius internus. For the further description of the portio dura, see p. il. Fio. 181. e. Stri^ acustioiB. /. Fasciculus teres. 'J. Tuberculmn acusti- oum. /*.

Its deep origin is principally from the inner auditory nucleus, situated in the floor of the fourth ventricle, under the tuberculum acusticum; this nucleus extends from beneath the acoustic tubercle to the middle of the anterior half of the floor, passing beneath the transverse strias; on its inner side, below, is the vagal nucleus, on its outer side is the restiform body; from this nucleus the fibres pass outwards, and, on curving round the restiform body, are joined by some filaments

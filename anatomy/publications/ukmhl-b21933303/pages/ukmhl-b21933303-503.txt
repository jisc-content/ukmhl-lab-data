THE DIAPHRAGM. 47^ tically, and tlieri all arch inwards, and converge to be inserted into the central tendon. The central tendon is nearly the highest part of the diaphragm. It presents a white glistening surface, owing to the crossing of its tendinous fibres; its shape may be compared to that of a trefoil leaf, and it is composed of a right and left leaflet and a middle leaflet, separated from each other by indentations. Of the three leaflets, the right is the largest and the left the smallest. The chief point of interest about the tendon is that, in consequence of its connections with the pericardium, below which it lies (p. 168), it is always maintained nearly on the same level; so that it helps to support the heart, and serves as a fixed point for the insertion of the muscular fibres of the diaphragm. Ope>tngs in There are THE DupHEAGM. three large openings in the diaphragm for the transmission of the aorta, the oesophagus, and the inferior vena cava, respectively, and several smaller apertures for the transmission of nerves and vessels. The aortic openincj is osseo-aponeurotic, and lies in the middle line between the two crura in front of the spine; it trans- mits, also, the vena azygos major and the thoracic duct, both of which lie rather to the right side of the aorta. Trace the crura upwards, and observe that the inner fibres of each cross each other in front of the aorta, somewhat like the letter X.^ Above the decussation, and a little to the left of it, is the oesophageal opening; this is oval and entirely muscular, and transmits the oesophagus ' This decussation is not always complete. But the right crus always crosses more or less over the left, so that the crura are never strictly parallel. Fi3. 113. DIAPHRAGM FBOM ITS UPPER SURFACE.

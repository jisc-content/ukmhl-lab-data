HRANCHES OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. 318 laris towards the lower angle of the scapula. Its numerous branches supply the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, serratus magnus, and teres major, and anastomose with the intercostal and thoracic arteries, and with the posterior scapular (a branch of the subclavian). The posterior branch (dorsalis scapuliB) runs to the back of the scapula, through a triangular space, bounded in front by the long head of the triceps; below, by the teres major ; and, above, by the subscapu- laris and teres minor (diagram, p. 318). It gives off a small branch which enters the subscapular fossa beneath the subscapularis, supplying it, and anastomosing with the suprascapular and posterior scapular arteries. On the back of the scapula it divides into two branches : one DIAGBAM or THE OBIQINS OF THE TEICEPS. runs in the groove on the axillary border of the scapula, lying beneath the teres minor, and ramifies in the infraspinous fossa between the bone and the infraspinatus ; the other runs down between the teres minor and major on their dorsal aspects, and passes to the inferior angle of the scapula, anastomosing with the posterior and suprascapular arteries. The subscapular vein empties itself into the axillary vein. f. The jwsterior circumflex artery arises from the back of the axillary artery, and is as large as the subscapular, close to which it is given off; or both may arise by a common trunk from the axillary. It passes backwards, with its corresponding veins and nerve, through a quadri- lateral space, bounded above by the subscapularis and teres minor, below by the teres major, externally by the neck of the humerus, and

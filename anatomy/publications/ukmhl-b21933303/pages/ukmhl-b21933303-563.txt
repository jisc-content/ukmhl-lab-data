rNTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 539 iNTEKNAii From tlie division of tlie common iliac artery, Iliac Akteky tlie internal iliac descends into the pelvis, and, AND BitAxciiEs. after a course of about an inch and a half, divides, opposite the great sacro-sciatic notch, into two large branches, an anterior and a posterior (fig. 129). The artery lies upon the lumbo- sacral cord, the pyrifoi'mis muscle, the external and internal iliac veins; the ureter, enclosed in the posterior false ligament of the bladder, passing in front: the psoas lies to its outer side at the commencement of its course. Fig. 129. PLAN OF THE BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ILL\C ABTERY. The iiosterior division gives ofi" the ilio-lumbar, lateral sacral, and gluteal arteries; the anterior gives off the superior vesical, obturator, inferior vesical, middle hEemorrhoidal, sciatic and pudic ; also the iiterine and vaginal in the female. Such is their usual order; but these branches, though constant as to their general distribution, vary as to their origin. The branches of the posterior division areâ€” a. The ilio-lumbar is analogous to the lumbar branches of the aorta. It ascends beneath the psoas and the external iliac vessels to get to the superficial surface of the iliacus. Here it divides into an iliac and a lumbar branch; the iliac branch supplies branches to the iliacus, a branch to the diploe of the ilium, and a large branch along the iliac crest, which finally inosculates with the deep

It is situated just below the crural arch and external to the spine of the os pubis ; it is oval, with the long axis vertical, and is about one inch and a half long and an inch broad. Its border on the inner side is not defined; for here the fascia lata ascends under the femoral vessels, and is continuous with the iliac fascia of the pelvis.• But the outer or iliac border is clearly defined.

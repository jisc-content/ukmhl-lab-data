PLANTAR ARTERIES. G88 Fig. 159. flexor brevis digitorum to tlie base of the great toe, and then is continued along the inner side of that toe, where it terminates in small inosculations with the digital arteries. Its chief use is to supply the muscles between which it runs. The external plantar is the principal artery of the sole, and alone forms the plantar arch (fig. 159). It runs obliquely outwards across the sole towards the base of the fifth metatarsal bone ; then, sinking deeply, it bends inwards across the bases of the metatarsal bones, and inoscu- lates with the communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis in the first interosseous space. At first it lies between the os calcis and the abductor hallucis; it then passes between the flexor brevis digitorum and the flexor accessorius; still continuing its course for- wards, it is placed between the flexor brevis digitorum and the flexor brevis minimi digiti, covered only with skin, fat and plantar fascia; and, lastly, it lies deep beneath the flexor tendons, the lumbricales, the adductor hal- lucis, upon the iuterossei muscles. Deeply seated as it appears to be, that part of its curve near the fifth metatarsal bone lies immediately beneath the fascia. The external plantar sends two or three internal calcaneo.n branches to the skin of the heel—one round the outer edge of the foot, which anastomoses with the tarsal and metatarsal branches of the arteria dorsalis pedis; and also some cutaneous branches which emerge between the adjacent borders of the flexor brevis minimi digiti and the flexor brevis digitorum. It also gives ofl":— The digital arteries, four in number, which arise from the deepest part of the arch. They supply both sides of the fifth, fourth, third and the outer side of the second toes; and, runmng forwards along the interossei, divide at the clefts of the toes into two branches, Avhich supply the contiguous sides of the adjacent toes. 1.

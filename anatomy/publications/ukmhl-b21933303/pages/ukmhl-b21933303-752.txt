728 STRUCTURE OF THE MEDULLA. Olivary The olivary bodies are composed externally of Bodies. wliite matter; but if a transverse section be made into tbem, their interior presents an undulating line of yellowish- brown colour, called, from its zigzag shape, the corpus dentatim or the nucleus of the olivary hody. It forms an interrupted circle, incomplete at its upper and inner side, so that it allows the entrance of a bundle of white fibres—olivary loeduncle—from the medulla behind the anterior pyramid. The peduncular fibres pass in various directions: some pass into the grey matter; some pass through it and join the restiform body, under the name of the internal arcuate fibres; and some passing between the fibres over the olivary body, come to the surface and curve round it, forming the external arcuate fibres. Two other isolated grey nuclei may be recognised in this transverse section, one on the inner side Fig. 173. 1. Anterior column. 2. Lateral eolumu. 3. Posterior column. liSkLHOli^'^ 4.

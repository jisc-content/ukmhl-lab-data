1C3 MEDIASTINA. M 2 simplest liglit, let us imagine tlie heart and lungs to be removed from the chest, and the two pleural sacs to be left in it by them- selves. The two sacs, if in- yig. 39. flated, would then appear like two bladders, in contact only in the middle, as shown by the dotted outlines in the annexed scheme (fig. 39). The interval marked a, behind the sternum, would represent the anterior mecliastimim; the interval h, the posterior mediastinum. Now let us introduce the heart again, between the two pleural sacs: these must give way to make room for it, so that the two sacs are largely separated in the middle line of the chest; and the space thus occupied by the heart and large vessels takes the-name of the middle mediastinum. Looking at the chest in front, the anterior mediastinum appears as shown in the diagi-am (fig. 40). It is not precisely vertical in its direction, for it inclines slightly towards the left, owing to the position of the heart. Its area varies: thus it is very shallow from before backwards; it is extremely narrow in the middle where the edges of the lungs nearly meet; it is wider above, and widest of all below, where the lungs diverge. Posteriori}^ it is limited by the pericardium covering the heart, aorta and its branches, and the pulmonary artery. What parts are contained in the anterior mediastinum ?â€”The remains of the thymus gland, the origins of the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and triangularis sterni muscles, the left brachio- cephalic vein (which crosses behind the first bone of the sternum), a few lymphatic glands, and the left internal mammary ai'tery and vein. The posterior mediastinum (fig. 38) is triangular in shape, placed in front of the dorsal vertebra: it contains the oesophagus, the two pneumogastric nerves, the descending aorta, the thoracic duct, the greater and smaller azygos veins, the left superior intercostal

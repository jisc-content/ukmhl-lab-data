661 GREAT SCIATIC NERVE. posterior division of the obturator nerve. This muscle lias in front of it, the adductor longus and brevis, the pectineus, the psoas and iliacus, the neck of the femur, and the capsular ligament; above it are, the capsular ligament and the inferior gemellus ; below it are, the adductor magnus and quadratus femoris; behind it are, the obturator membrane and the quadratus femoris. Great Sciatic This large nerve, formed by the union of the Nerve. last lumbar and the four upper sacral nerves (fig. 152), is the largest nerve in the body, being three-quarters of an Fia. 153. 8 1.

Emerging from the pelvis through the great sacro-sciatic foramen below the pyriformis, it descends over the external rotator muscles of the thigh, along the interval between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter, but rather nearer to the former ; so that, in the sitting position, the nerve is protected from pressure by this bony prominence. The nerve does not descend quite perpendicu- larly, but rather obliquely forwards upon the adductor magnus, parallel with the great sacro-sciatic ligament, and below the middle of the thigh divides into the internal popliteal and the peroneal (or G.

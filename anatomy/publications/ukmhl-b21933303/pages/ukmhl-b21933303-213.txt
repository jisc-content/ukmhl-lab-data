The great svlanchnic nerve is generally formed by brandies from the fifth or sixth to the tenth ganglion, and also receiving- filaments, according to Beck, from all the thoracic ganglia above the sixth. They descend obliquely by the sides of the bodies of the dorsal ver- tebras, along the posterior mediasti- num, and unite into a single nerve, which passes through the correspond- ing crus of the diaphragm, and joins the semilunar ganglion of the abdo- men, sending also branches to the renal and supra-renal plexuses. h. The lesser splanchnic nerve is commonly formed by branches from the tenth and eleventh ganglia. It passes through the crus of the dia- phragm to the coeliac plexus, and occasionally to the renal plexus.* c. The smallest splanchnic nerve comes from the twelfth ganglion, passes through the crus of the dia- phragm, and terminates in the lower part of the coeliac and renal plexuses.

Intercostal The intercostal Muscles. muscles fill in the intervals between the ribs and are ar- ranged in each interval in two layers, an external and an internal, which cross each other like the letter X. The external intercostals, eleven on each side, run obliquely from behind forwards, like the external oblique muscle of the ' In a few instances we have traced a minute filament from one of the ganglia into the body of a vertebra. According to CruveUhier each vertebra receives one. DIAGBAM OF THE THOEACIO PORTION OF THE SYMPATHETIC.

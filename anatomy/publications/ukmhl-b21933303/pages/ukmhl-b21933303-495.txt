Then, by removing the anterior layer of the peritoneum from the mesentery, we expose the mode in which the superior mesenteric artery ramifies so as to supply the small intestines. In making this dissection, the mesenteric glands immediately attract notice. They lie in great numbers- between the layers of the mesentery, and vary consider- ably in size.

SENSORY NERVES OF THE SCALP. In front will be found the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital nerves; in tbe temporal region, there are the temporal filament from the orbital branch of the superior maxillary, the auriculo- temporal, and the temporal branches of the facial nerve ; and behind will be seen the posterior auricular branch of the facial, the small and great occipital nerves, and occasionally, a small filament from the posterior division of the sub-occipital nerve.

It appears at the inner angle of the orbit, and ascending beneath the orbicularis palpebrarum and occipito- frontalis, it finally supplies the skin of the forehead, and the upper eyelid. The supra-orhital nerve is a continuation of the frontal branch of the fifth. It emerges from the orbit through the notch in the frontal

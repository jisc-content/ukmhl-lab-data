MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 723 backwards through the foramen magnum. Its posterior surface is received into the fossa (vallecula) between the hemispheres of the cerebellum. It is about an inch and a quarter in length, three quarters of an inch at its broadest part, and half an inch in thick- ness. In front and behind, the medulla is marked by a median fissure, the anterior and posterior median fissii,res, which are the continuations of the median fissures of the spinal cord. The anterior ends, below the pons Varolii, in a cul-de-sac, termed the faramem, ccemm, and is occupied by a process of pia mater. The Pig. 17]. C. Crus cerebri. P. V. Pons Varolii. P.

The surface of the medulla is marked out on each side into four longitudinal columns, which receive the following names, 1 from before backwards : the anterior pyramids, the lateral tracts and t the olivary bodies, the restiform bodies, and the posterior pyramids. The anterior pyramids are two columns of white matter, narrow 3 A 2

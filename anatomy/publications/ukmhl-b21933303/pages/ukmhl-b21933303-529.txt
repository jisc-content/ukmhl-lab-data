505 DISSECTION OF THE MALE PERINEUM. the peritoneum in the male. It is called the canal of Niich, and is : enerally obliterated in the adult. It is sometimes the seat of an 1 nominal hernia. Eelections From the front of the rectum the peritoneum is OF THE Peki- reflected on to a small jDart of the posterior wall of TONEUM. t;]^g vagina, thus forming what is called the recto- ccujinal pouch. From the vagina the peritoneum is continued over the posterior surface, but only about half-way down the front of the uterus; thence it is reflected over the posterior surface of the bladder, on to the wall of the abdomen. Laterally, it is reflected from the uterus to the sides of the pelvis, forming the broad licja^ ments (p. 571). In cases of ascites the fluid might distend the recto-vaginal pouch, and bulge into the vagina, so that it would be practicable to draw it off throusfh this channel. DISSECTION OF THE MALE PEEINEUM. Fig. 118. Before dissecting the perineum, it is exj)edient first to examine the osseous and ligamentous boundaries of the lower aperture of the pelvis. Looking at the male pelvis (with the ligaments pre- served), we observe that this aperture is of a lozenge shape ; that it is bounded in front by the pubic arch and the sub- pubic ligament; laterally, anteriorly, by the rami of the os pubis and ischium, and the tuberosity of the ischium, posteriorly, by the great sciatic ligament; and helivHd, by the tip of the coccyx. This space, for convenience of de- scription, is subdivided into two by a line drawn from one tuber ischii to the other. The anterior forms a nearly equilateral triangle, of which the sides are from three to three and a half inches long; and, since it transmits the urethra, it is called DIAGHAII OF THE FRAMEWOUK OF THE PEEINEUM.

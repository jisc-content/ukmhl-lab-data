These lines form the boundaries of three spaces, each of which is subdivided into three regions by a vertical line drawn on each side from the carti- lage of the eighth rib to the middle of Poupart's ligament. Thus, there are a central and two lateral regions in each space. The central region of the upper space is termed the epigastric; the central one of the middle space is called the umbilical region; and the central of the in- ferior space, the lujporjasfric region. The lateral regions of the spaces from above downwards are termed the right and left hypochondriac, the right and left lumhar, and the right and left inguinal or iliac regions, respectively.

In the umhUical region are, the transverse colon, the great omentum and mesentery, the round ligament of the liver, the transverse portion of the duodenum, and part of the jejunum and ileum. In the hypogastric region are, the small intestines, the urachus, the two obliterated hypogastric arteries, the bladder naturally in early life, and in the adult if distended; and, lastly, the uteras in pregnancy.

FISSURES OF THE CEREBRUM. 786 obliquely over tlie outer convex surface of the hemispliere. It commences close to tlie longitudinal fissure about its middle, from which it is separated by the marginal convolution. It then runs obliquely downwards and forwards, and terminates a little above Fig. 176. 0 CONVOLUTIONS OF THE ITPPEB SUBPAOE OF THE BRAIN. A. Fissure of Rolando. o. Occipital lobe. A.F.

The fissure is formed, in early foetal life, by a large vein, which subse- quently atrophies, and is rarely bridged over. The parieto-occipital fissure (fig. 178, P.O.) is seen on the median

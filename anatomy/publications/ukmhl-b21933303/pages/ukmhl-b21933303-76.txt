52 PRONTAL NERVE. and nasal brancli. The ophtlialmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid, passes into the orbit through the optic foramen; its vein passes backwards through the sphenoidal fissure to join the cavern- ous sinus. The ophthalmic, or first division of the fifth— Frontal Nerve. „, . . rf n •. a sensory nerve—alter gmng on irom its inner and lower side, whilst within the cavernous sinus, the nasal nerve, divides into the frontal and lachrymal nerves, of which the former is the larger. It is the smallest division of the fifth, and runs for- wards for the distance of about an inch ; in its course it is con- nected with the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic, with the third, fourth, and sixth nerves, and close to its origin from the Gasserian ganglion it sends off a small recurrent branch to the ten- torium cerebelli. One of its divisions, the frontal nerve, runs for- wards upon the upper surface of the levator palpebr^, on which, about midway in the orbit, it divides into two branches—the supra- trochlear and the supra-orbital. Fig. 20. OPTIC VIEW OP ORBIT FBOJI ABOVE. a. The siqora-trochlear, the smaller of the two (fig. 20) runs obliquely inwards above the pulley of the superior oblique to the imier angle of the orbit. Here it gives off a small communication do\vnwarcls to the

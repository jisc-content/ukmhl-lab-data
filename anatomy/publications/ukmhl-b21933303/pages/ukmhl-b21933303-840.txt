816 DISSECTION OF TEE ORGAN OF HEARING. The parts constituting the organ of hearing should be examined in the following order: (1) the outer cartilage or pinna; (2) the meatus auditorius externus; which leads to (3) the tympanum or middle ear; and (4) the labyrinth or internal ear, comprising the vestibule, cochlea, and semicircular canals, which contain the distribution of the auditory nerve. The pinna or auricle consists of yellow fibro- irlNNA. , cartilage covered with integument, and is irre- gularly concave to receive the undulations of sound. It is unevenly oval, and presents on its external aspect numerous emi- nences and hollows, which have received the following names:— The circumferential folded border is called the helix: the rid^e within it, the antihelix; between these is a curved groove, called the fossa of the helix. The antihelix bifurcates towards the front, and encloses th.Q fossa of the antihelix (fossa scaphoidea). The conical eminence in front of the meatus is termed the tragus, on which some hairs are usually found. Behind the tragus, and separated from it by a deep notch (incisura intertragica), is the antitragiis. The lohule is the soft pendulous part placed below the concha, and consists of fat and fibrous tissue. The deep hollow, which collects the vibrations of sound, and conveys them into the external meatus, is termed the concha. The pinna is composed of yellow fibro-cartilaofe, StBUCTUBE. .IP 1 .■ T ■^ with some lat and connective tissue, covered with integument, and attached to neighbouring parts, partly by fibrous tissue and partly by muscles. The shin is very thin, intimately adherent to the subjacent cartUage, and provided with numerous sebaceous glands, found chiefly in the scaphoid fossa and the concha.

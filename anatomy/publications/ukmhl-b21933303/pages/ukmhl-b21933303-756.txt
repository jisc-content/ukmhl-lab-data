THE CEREBRUM. 732 The tJbird layer is formed of transverse fibres, which from their peculiar arrangement take the name of traioeziwrn; the fibres in their course outwards pass round in front of the superior olivary nuclei, then across the fasciculi of the facial nerves, and lastly in front of the ascending roots of the fifth nerves to enter the middle peduncle of the cerebellum. The deepest and uppermost layer is composed of longitudinal nerve-fibres : those derived from the olivary fasciculi divide into two bundles, one ascending to the corpora quadrigemina, the other passing to the cerebrum; and those derived from the lateral and posterior columns of the cord, which, with a fasciculus from the fillet, form the fasciculi teretes in the floor of the fourth ventricle, and pass upwards to form the tegmenta, or deeper portions of the crura cerebri. The grey matter is chiefly aggregated at the posterior part of the pons, and varies in thickness in different sections. Thus a section through the middle of the pons will show the following nuclei of grey matter, beginning from the central groove and passing outwards; a small intermediate portion of the facial nerve, the large nucleus of the sixth, the facial nerve, the large superior nucleus of the auditoiy nerve ; while below we notice the superior olivary nucleus, the nucleus of the facial nerve, and externally the grey substance of Rolando, enclosing the ascending root of the fifth nerve. The pons, like the medulla oblongata, has an imperfect median septum, composed of horizontal fibres, some of which at the anterior border surround the crura cerebri. THE CEREBRUM. The cerebrum in man is so much more developed than the other parts of the encephalon that it completely overUes them, and forms by far the largest portion. It is oval in form, and convex on its external aspect. It is divided in the middle line into two symmetrical parts, termed the rigJit and left hemispheres, by the deep longitudinal fissure, which is occupied by the falx cerebn

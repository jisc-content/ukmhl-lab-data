The ligaments connecting them are similar in every respect to those between the metacarpal bones and the first phalanges. The palmar ligament of the last joint of the thumb generally contains a sesamoid bone. The wrist-joint is a complex articulation, in which the seat of movement is partly in the radio-carpal, and partly in the inter- carpal articulation. Thus the hand at the radio-carpal joint is capable of extension (dorsi-flexion) and flexion, the latter being the most free; it is also capable of adduction (ulnar flexion) and of abduction (radial flexion) to a lesser extent. Between the carpal bones and carpo-metacarpal bones, the movement which takes place when the hand is pressed down so as to support the weight of the body, is that of separation of the anterior part of their apposed surfaces; undue separation being prevented by the interosseous and palmar ligaments. The articulation between the unciform and fourth and fifth metacarpals is not so firm as that between the other carpo-metacarpal bones, consequently there is greater freedom of motion forwards, seen ill deepening the palm and in shutting the hand. The movements at the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation are those of extension and flexion, of adduction and abduction, the two latter being most marked in extension of the finger. Between the thumb and trapezium all the movements of an enarthrodial joint exist, except that of rotation; a little rotation probably takes place when the metacarpal bone is fiexed. In the interphalangeal and phalangeal joints, the only movements permitted are those of extension and flexion.

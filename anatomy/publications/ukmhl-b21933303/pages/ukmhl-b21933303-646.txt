PARTS CONCEKNED IN FEMORAL HERNIA. G22 uppermost, into which the femoral vessels enter. This is the funnel-shaped sheath of the femoral vessels. The fascia transversal is, descencling over the femoral vessels, forms the front imrt of their sheath ; the hind part of the sheath is formed by the fascia iliaca, which runs down behind the vessels to join the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The sheath descends as low as the lower horn of the saphenous opening, where it is gradu- ally lost upon the external cellular coat (tunica adventitia) of the femoral vessels. The outer part of the sheath, in front, is perforated Fig. 147. 1. 1. Fnsola transver- sal is. 2. Internal ring. 3. Crural arch re- flected. i. Sheath of the fe- moral vcFsels. 6. Saphena vein. DIAGEAM OF THE SHEATH OP THE FEMOEAL VESSELS. by the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve, and the superficial arteries of the groin ; the inner part, by the saphena vein and some lymphatic vessels. The sheath of the femoral vessels is divided into three com- partments separated from each other by partitions: the outer is occupied by the femoral artery; the middle, by the femoral vein; the inner is the crural canal, into which a femoral hernia descends. The deep crural arch is the thickened band of fibres connected with the front of the crural sheath; the fibres run in the same

THE FACIAL NERVE. 46 The malar branches cross the malar bone, supply the orbicular muscle, and communicate with filaments of the lachrymal, the supra- orbital, the superior maxillary, and the malar branch of the superior maxillary. Fig. 17. DIAGRAM OF THE BEANCHES OF THE FACIAL NERVE, 1. Brnncli to oocipito-froutalis. 5. Infra-orbitaL 2. Posterior auricular. 6. Buccal. 3. Temporal branches. 7. Supra-maxillary. 4. Malar branches. 8. Intra-maxlllary. The infra-orhital branches are the largest, and proceed transversely forwards over the masseter beneath the zygomatici, to supply the orbi- cularis oris, the elevators of the upper lip, and the muscles of the nose. The superficial branches join -with the nasal and infra-trochlear branches of the ophthalmic along the side of the nose ; the deep branches com- municate beneath the levator labii superioris with the infra-orbital branches of the superior maxillary nerve forming the infra-orhital 2}lexus, and also with the buccal branches of the facial. The cervico-facial division, joined in the parotid gland by fila- ments from the great auricular (branch of the cervical plexus), descends towards the angle of the jaw, and subdivides into buccal, supra- and infra-maxillary branches.

The second, the largest, passes through the tendons of the adductor brevis and magnus, divides into an ascending and a descending branch, which anastomose respectively with the first and third perfora-* ting arteries. It usually furnishes the nutrient artery of the femur. The third, given off" below the adductor brevis, passes through the tendon of the adductor magnus. The fourth, or terminal branch, passes I

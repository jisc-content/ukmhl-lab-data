The veins are arranged with great regularity in drooping branches (vence vorticosce) like a weeping willow (fig. 199), and converge to four or five nearly equidistant trunks, which, after running back- wards for a short distance, perforate the sclerotic not far from the entrance of the optic nerve, and empty themselves into the oph- thalmic vein. Between the veins there are interspersed numerous stellate pigment-cells which anastomose with neighbouring cells; on the inner side of this layer the cells are absent. The internal layer is formed by the capillaries of the ciliary arteries and is called the tunica.

It extends forwards as far as the etina, where the intervals become larger and the vessels freely ommunicate with those of the ciliary processes. This tissue has m its inner surface a transparent membrane, the membrane of Wuch, which rests on the pigmentary layer of the retina.

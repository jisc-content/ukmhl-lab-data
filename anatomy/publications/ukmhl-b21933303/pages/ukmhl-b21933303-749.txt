MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 725 the spinal cord. As described, the greater number of their fibres pass across the anterior median fissure to the opposite anterior pyramid; but some ascend as far as the lower border of the olivary body, where they divide, a few passing in front of, but the larger part passing behind this body in their course to the brain. The restiform ^ bodies are the broadest and thickest of the columns of the medulla. They are situated to the outer side and behind the lateral tracts and the olivary bodies. They are the continuations upwards of the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and as they ascend, they diverge and pass into the cerebellum, Fm. 172.

Owing to this divergence, the grey matter of the medulla is exposed, so that the floor of the fourth ventricle (of which the restiform bodies and the posterior pyramids assist in forming the lateral boundaries) is mainly composed of grey matter.

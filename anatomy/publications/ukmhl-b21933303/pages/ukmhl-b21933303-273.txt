INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. 249 Fig. 58. M. Ab\'te- This single miiscle is situated immediately at NotDEus. the back of the arytenoid cartilages. The fibres pass across from one cartilage to the other running in a transverse direction. Action.—By approximating the arytenoid cartilages, they assist in contracting the glottis. It is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve. M. Aktteno- This muscle EPiGLOTTiDETjs. ctvises from the inferior and outer ano-le of the arytenoid cartilage, and, crossing its fellow like the letter X, is inserted, partly into the apex of the opposite arytenoid cartilage, and partly into epiglottic fold.

It arises from the upper border of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and the fibres, passing backwards and up- wards, converge to be inserted into the external angle of the base of the arytenoid, in front of the crico- arytenoideus posticus. Action.— By drawing the arytenoid carti- lages inwards, the muscles of opposite sides contract the, glottis (fig. 59). Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal.

It is in connection with the crico-arytenoideus posticus, and is usually found on one side only, being present in about one in five subjects. (Merkel, Anat. unci Phys. des mensch.

6G8 DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. popliteal will deferred till later, until tlie muscles of tlie calf have been reflected. Tlie articular branches which come from the popliteal are given off at right angle's to that vessel; and besides these it gives off the sural which supply the muscles of the calf, and the azygos artery; close to the vessel is the articular branch of the obturator nerve which supplies the knee-joint. The popliteal vein lies superficial to the artery, and rather to its outer side. It receives the short saphena vein. Its coats are remarkably thick, and on transverse section resemble those of an artery of a similar size. Lymphatic Two or more lymphatic glands are situated one Glands. on each side of the artery. They deserve atten- tion, because, when enlarged, their close proximity to the artery may communicate a pulsation which might be mistaken for an aneurism. DISSECTION OF THE BACK OF THE THIGH. The incision should be continued along the remainder of the back of the thigh, and the skin reflected. The fat should be removed, and the cutaneous branches derived from the external and internal cutaneous nerves, and the small sciatic, should be carefully sought out. Cutaneous ^^^^^ skin on the middle of the back of the thigh Nervus and is supplied by the small sciatic nerve, which runs ^^^^s- down beneath the deep fascia as far as the middle third ; then pierces it, and runs down as far as the middle third of the calf, distributing branches on each side. On the outer side, a few cutaneous branches from the posterior division of the external cutaneous nerve supply the skin as far as the middle third; on the inner side are small branches from the small sciatic and the internal cutaneous nerves as low as the knee-joint. The subcutaneous veins at the back of the thigh are very small; here they would be liable to pressure. But near the popliteal space there is a vein, called the external or short saphena. It comes up

DISSECTION OF THE SIDE VIEW OF THE PELVIS. 525 Externally there is a plexus of veins bearing a strong resemblance to erectile tissue. The vagina is the canal which leads to the AoiNA. uterus; at present, only the orifice of it can be seen. It is surrounded by a sphincter muscle, easily displayed by removing the integument. The muscle is about three-fourths of an inch broad, and connected with the cutaneous sphincter of the : anus in such a manner that they together form something like the •■ figure 8. On each side of the orifice of the vagina, between the mucous ; membrane and the sphincter, is a plexus of tortuous veins, termed • the hull) of the vagina, from its analogy to the bulb of the urethra in the male. This vaginal bulb is about an inch long and extends across the middle line between the meatus urinarius and the clitoris, as shown in fig. 124, The description of the perineal branches of the pudic vessels and nerves, given in the dissection of the male perineum, applies, mutatis mutandis, to the female, excepting that they are propor- tionably small, and that the artery which supplies the bulb of the urethra in the male is distributed to the bulb of the vagina in the female. ANATOMY OF THE SIDE VIEW OF THE PELVIC VISCEBA. To obtain a side view of the pelvic viscera, the Dissection. left innominate bone should be removed thus:— Detach the peritoneum and the levator ani from the left side of the pelvis, cut through the external iliac vessels, the obturator vessels and nerve, and the nerves of the lumbar plexus ; then saw through the OS pubis about two inches external to the symphysis, and cut through the sacro-iliac symphysis; now draw the legs apart, and saw through the base of the spine of the ischium; after cutting through the pyriformis, the great sacro-.sciatic ligament, the great and small sciatic nerves, and the gluteus maximus muscle, the innominate bone can be easily detached. This done, the rectum

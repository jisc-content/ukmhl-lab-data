THE PERITONEUM. 459 Pig. 105. Yrom tlie diapliragm two layers of peritoneum jiroceed to the liver, forming its laieral ligaments; they separate to enclose the liver, meet again on its under aspect, and pass on, under the name of the gastro-Jiepatia omentum, to the small curve of the stomach. Separating here, they embrace the stomach, and, meeting again at its greater curve, pass down like a curtain over the small in- testine to form the great omentum. At the lower margin of the great omentum, they are reflected up- wards (so that the great omentum consists of four layers) to the front of the transverse colon, which they enclose, and, after joining again at the back of the colon, proceed to the spine, forming the transverse meso-colon. At this situation the two layers diverge, the upper one ascends in front of the pancreas, and the crura of the diaphragm to its under surface, at which point we started.^ The peritoneum passes from the under surface of the right lobe of the liver to the kidney, forming a slight foldâ€”the liepato-renal fold; on the left side, where the peritoneum extends from the dia- phragm to the cardiac end of the stomach, it passes as a slight duplicature, forming the gastro-phrenic ligament; an extension of ' In foetal life, the ascending layers of the great omentum may be traced back to the spine near the pancreas ; and here the layers diverge from each other. The upper layer ascends in front of the pancreas to the diaphragm; the lower layer proceeds over the arch of the colon, and then back to the spine, thus forming the transverse meso-colon. Its reflections afterwards are the same as in the adult. As the fcetus grows, the great omentum becomes adherent to the arch of the colon. DUGBAM OF THE PEHITONEUM.

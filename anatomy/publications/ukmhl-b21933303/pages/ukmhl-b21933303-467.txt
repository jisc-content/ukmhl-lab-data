OBLIQUE AND DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA. 443 Coverings of ^ complete oblique inguinal hernia, passing as AN Oblique In- it does through the same structures as the testis GuiNAL Hebnu. foetal life, receives the same coverings as that gland; they are :— 1. The sHn and the superjicicd fascia. 2. The intercolumnar fascia, derived from the external oblique. 3. The cremaster, derived from the internal oblique and transversalis.' 4. The infundihuliform fascia, derived from the fascia transversahs. 5. The subperitoneal fat, and the peritoneum which constitutes the sac. An incomplete oblique inguinal hernia is covered by— 1. The sMn and superficial fascia. 2. The ajooneurosis of the external oblique. 3. The cremaster. 4. The inftmdibuliform fascia. 5. The subperitoneal fat and the peritoneum.

Sometimes it pro- trudes internal to the deep epigastric artery through a triangular weak place, Hesselbach's triangle, bounded on the inner side by the rectus, on the outer side by the deep epigastric artery, and below by Poupart's ligament. This space is relatively weak, having in front of it only the fascia transversalis and the conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis; moreover, it is situated immediately behind the external abdominal ring. A jDortion of intestine protruding through this triangle comes directly forwards through the external ring, and the hernia is then called a direct inguinal hernia. Coverings of a ^ direct inguinal hernia protrudes immediately Direct Inguinal on the inner side of the epigastric artery through the external ring; and its course forwards is mainly prevented by the resistance of the conjoined tendon.^ This hernia is covered by— ' The cremaster muscle is absent in the female. ' In our experience the weakness of the conjoined tendon is, anatomically speaking, the determining cause of this form of hernia.

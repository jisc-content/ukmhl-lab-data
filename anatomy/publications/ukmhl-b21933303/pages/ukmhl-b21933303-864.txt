THE TESTIS. 840 major (fig. 207, 5) and of a lower smaller end, the globus minor (fig. 207, 6), the two being connected together by the body. The globus major is connected with the testicle by radiating efferent ducts; the globus minor is only connected with the organ by con- nective tissue and the tunica vaginalis. The upper and lower ends and the outer surface of the epididymis are covered with serous membrane, as is also the body, except at its anterior border, where the vessels enter and emerge. Situated between the globus major and the body of the testis are one or two small pedunculated bodies, called the hydatids of Morgagni; they are formed by pouch- FiG. 207. 1.

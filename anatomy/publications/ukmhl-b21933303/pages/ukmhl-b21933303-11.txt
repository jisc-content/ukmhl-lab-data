TO PEEFACE FIFTH EDITION. THE I'S THIS EDITION the Editor has most carefully revised tlie entire work. The order of dissection has been here and there altered, and further illustrations and additional matter introduced, especi- ally concerning the Anatomy of the Nervous System and the Organs of Special Sense. The object throughout has been to be as concise as possible, and to put the subject in as clear and practical a light as is com- patible with the faithful handling of its natural difficulties. It is hoped that the work, in its present form, is adapted, not only for students, but for members of the profession who wish to refresh their anatomical knowledge. The best thanks of the Editor are due to the Demonstrators and Assistant Demonstrators of Anatomy at St. Bartholomew's Hospital for valuable suggestions. 2 Hablet Stheet, Cavendish Sqdabe : September 1884.

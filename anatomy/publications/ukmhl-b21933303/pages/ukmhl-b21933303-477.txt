RELATIONS OF THE LARGE INTESTINE. 453 concerns tlie human subject, is misapplied; tlie canal runs anything but a straight course through the pelvis, since it curves to adapt itself to the sacrum. Looking at the entire course of the colon, observe that it forms an arch, of which the concavity embraces the convolutions of the small intestines. Let us now see to what extent the small and the large intestines are invested with a peritoneal coat. The smcdl intestines, with the exception of the duodenum, which cannot at present be examined, we shall find are completely surrounded by peritoneum, except at ; • their mesenteric border along which the vessels pass to the bowel; the cceciim is covered, as a rule only in front and on its sides, the posterior surface being connected to the iliac fascia by connective tissue; the ascending colon is also only covered on the front aspect and sides, the posterior surface being loosely connected by areolar tissue to the quadratus lumborum and right kidney; the transverse colon is almost- entirely surrounded by peritoneum, which is re- flected horizontally backwards as a broad double layer—the trans- verse meso-colon—to the spine ; the descending colon, smaller than the transverse colon, and more deeply situated than the ascending colon, is only invested with peritoneum on its anterior and inner surfaces; the sigmoid flexure is completely invested with peri- toneum, which connects this part of the bowels with a loose fold to the left iliac fossa; the rectum is completely surrounded by peritoneum in its iipper half, and is connected to the front of the sacrum by a fold, the meso-rectum; the lower half of the rectum, for the first three inches, is only covered in front with peritoneum; the last inch and a half has no peritoneal investment at all.^ Relations of -^t present we have only traced the course of THE Labge the large intestine through the different abdominal Intestine. regions, but now we are able to see the relations of the various portions of the bowel. The ccecum rests in the right iliac fossa, separated from the ' It should be recollected, that the ascending and descending colon are not infrequently completely invested by peritoneum, and therefore, virtually speaking, have a mesentery. This occasional occurrence is important when the operation of right or left lumbar colotomy has to be performed.

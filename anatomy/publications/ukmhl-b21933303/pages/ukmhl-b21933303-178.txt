154 SYMPATHETIC NERVE IN THE NECK. artery, and join the superior cardiac nerve, and in the gland they com- municate Avith the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The middle cardiac nerve, the largest of the three cardiac nerves, descends, on the right side behind the common carotid a., usually in front of the first part of the subclavian artery, into the chest, when it lies on the trachea. It is joined by some cardiac filaments from the recurrent laryngeal ner\'e and superior cardiac nerve, and joins the deep cardiac plexus. On the left side this cardiac nerve enters the chest between the left carotid and subclavian arteries. In cases where the middle cervical ganglion is absent, the pre- ceding nerves are supplied by the sympathetic cord connecting the superior and inferior ganglia. The inferior cervical ganglion is of considerable size, and is situated in the interval between the base of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib, im- mediately behind the vertebral artery, and to the inner side of the superior intercostal artery. Not infrequently it is coalesced with the first dorsal sympathetic ganglion. Its branches are as follow :â€” a. Superior branches which pass upwards and connect it with the middle cervical ganglion. h. Inferior hranches which descend, some in front of, and some behind, the subclavian a., to join the first dorsal ganglion. One of these, the inferior cardiac nerve, passes behind the subclavian a. in front of the trachea, to join the deep cardiac plexus, beneath the arch of the aorta, and communicates with the recurrent laryn- geal and middle cardiac nerves. c. External hranches which communicate with the seventh and eighth cervical nerves; others form a plexus around the verte- bral artery, which join with the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical nerves.

INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 139 discovered, after very careful dissection, between it and the motor root of the third division. ^ The minculo-teiTvporal branch arises by two roots which embrace the middle meningeal artery before it enters the skull. The nerve runs backwards behind the external pterygoid and the neck of the jaw, ascends at first beneath the j^arotid gland, then over the root of the zygoma with the temporal artery, and divides, like it, into Fig. 35. PLAN OF THE BRANCHES OF THE INFEEIOR SIAXILLAEY NERVE. an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior branch supplies the pinna and surrounding tissues ; the anterior is distributed to the skin covering the vertex and temporal region, communicating with the temporal branches of the facial nerve and the orbital branch of the superior maxillary. â–  Turner, ' On the Variation of the Buccal Nerve.'

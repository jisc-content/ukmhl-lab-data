609 DISSECTION OF TEE LOWER EXTREMITY. The body mnst be placed on its back, with a block placed beneath the buttocks, and the thigh should then be slightly flexed and abducted. SuRFACK The student, before commencing to reflect the Makking. skin, should notice the irregularities of the surface which are produced by subjacent structures. The upper part of the thigh is marked ofl^ from the abdomen by a more or less well- marked curved furrow, having its convexity downwards. This furrow corresponds with Poupart's ligament, which is attached externally to the anterior superior iliac spine, and internally to the spine of the os pubis. The spine of the os pubis can, even in the fattest subject, be distinctly felt, and is a very valuable land- mark in the diagnosis between an inguinal and a femoral hernia ; for the aperture through which an inguinal hernia emerges is the external abdominal ring, situated above the spine; the aperture through which a femoral hernia comes out is the saphenous open- ing, situated outside the spine. In front of the thigh is a large triangular depression corresponding with Scarpa's triangle, which has its base at Poupart's ligament. This depression, which is best seen in thin subjects, contains the large vessels and nerves passing down to the leg, the femoral artery being nearly in the centre of the space : a furrow indicating the course of these vessels may be observed extending obliquely down the inner side of the thigh. About three or four inches below the anterior superior iliac spine, there is seen on the outer side of the thigh the well- marked prominence of the great trochanter, which is nearly on the same level as the spine of the os pubis. The sartorius can bo seen passing obliquely inwards from the iliac spine, and crossing over the femoral vessels about four inches below Poupart's ligament; in the latter two-thirds of its course it descends nearly vertically.

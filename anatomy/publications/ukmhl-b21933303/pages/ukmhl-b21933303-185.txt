It may now be traced, as the itlenm indmonalis, over the surface of the lung, to which it is intimately adherent, into the fissures between the lobes, as far as the anterior border of the lung; thence round its pericardial aspect Fin. 38.

Its only reflection, the ligamentum latum pulmonis, has been already alluded to. Below, the pleura covers the diaphragm. The pleura rises as a conical dome into the^base of the neck, about an inch above the first rib, and is strengthened in this situation by expansions from the scaleni muscles.^ The thickness of the pleura differs : on the lung it is thin, semi-transparent, and firmly adherent; on the ribs and diaphragm it is thick, and may be easily separated from its osseous and muscular connections.'^ ' A slip is described by Sibson as i^assing from the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra, and, spreading out, is inserted into the pleural dome and the inner margin of the first rib. ^ From the prevertebral fascia, a ligamentous band passes downwards along the inner border of the lung to be - attached to the pericardium and the central M

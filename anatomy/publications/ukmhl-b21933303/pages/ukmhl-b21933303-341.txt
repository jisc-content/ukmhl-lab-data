317 BRANCHES OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. two interna] cutaneous nerves; behind it are, in succession, the subscapularis, tlie latissimus dorsi, the teres major, and the musculo-spiral and circumflex nerves. Branches of The number and origin of these branches often THE AxiLLABY varj, but their general course is in most cases Artery. similar, and they usually arise in the following order:— a. The superior thoracic arises above the pectoralis minor, and divides into branches, which have been already described (p. 310). b. The acromial thoracic also arises above the pectoralis minor, and gives off numerous branches already described (p. 310). c. The alar thoracic, variable in its origin, supplies the lymi^hatic glands and the connective tissue of the axilla. PLAN OF THE BRANCHES OF THE AXILLABY AETERY. 1. Thoracic axis, giving off— 2.

The inferior or long thoracic artery (external mammary) runs along the lower border of the pectoralis minor to the side of the cliest. It supplies the mammary gland, the serratus magnus and pectoral muscles, and maintains a free anastomosis with the short thoracic, internal mammary, and intercostal arteries. e. The subscapular is the largest branch of the axillary ; it arises opposite the lower border of the subscapularis, and, after runniug a short course of about an inch and a half, divides uato an anterior and po.sterior branch. The anterior branch runs along the anterior edge of the subscapu-

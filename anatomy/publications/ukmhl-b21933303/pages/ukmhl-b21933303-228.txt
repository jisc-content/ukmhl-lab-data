204 PULMONARY VALVES. the flaps will be approximated. Thirdly, to insure the strength of every part of the valve, the tendinous cords are inserted at three different points of it in straight lines; accordingly, they are divi- sible into three sets. Those of the first, which are three or four in number, are attached to the base of the valve ; those of the second, from four to six, proceed to the middle of its ventricular surface; those of the third, which are the smallest and most numerous, are attached to its free margin.^ PuLsroNABY OR Thesc are three semicircular membranous folds, Semllunak like watch-pockets, situated at the orifice of the Valves. pulmonary artery. They are attached by their convex borders to the root of the artery; their free edges look upwards, and jiresent a festooned border, in the centre of which is a small cartilaginous body called the nodtdus or corpus Arantii."^ The use of these bodies is plain. Since the valves are semilunar, when they fall together they would not exactly close the artery; there would be a space of a triangular form left between them in the centre, just as there is when we put the thumb, fore, and middle fingers together. This space is filled up by these nodules, so that the closure becomes complete. The valves, two anterior and one posterior, are composed of folds of the endocardi'ion, or lining membrane of the heart. Between the folds is a thin layer of fibrous tissue, which is prolonged from the fibrous ring at the orifice of the artery. This layer of fibrous tissue, however, reaches the free edge of the valve at three points ' The best mode of showing the action of the valve is to introduce a glass tube into the j)ulmonaiy artery, and then to pour water through it into the ventricle until the cavity is quite distended. By gently squeezing the ventricle in the hand, so as artificially to imitate its natural contraction, the tricuspid valve will flap back like a flood-gate, and close the auriculo-ventricular opening. In this way one can understand how, when the ventricle contracts, the blood catches the margin of the valve, and by its pressure gives it the proper distension and figure requisite to block up the aperture into the auricle. It is obvious that the tendinous cords will prevent the valve from fla]pping back into the auricle; and this purijose is assisted by the papillary muscles, which nicely adjust the degree of tension of the cords at a time when they would otherwise be too much slackened by the contraction of the ventricle. - So called after Arantius, an Italian anatomist, who lived towards the close of the sixteenth century.

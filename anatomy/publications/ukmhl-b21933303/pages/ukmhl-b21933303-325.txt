301 COSTO-VERTEBRAL LIGAMENTS. of the head of the rib with the sides of the bodies of two vertebra) and the intervening fibro-cartilage (fig. 72). It is composed of three fasciculi of fibres which radiate from the rib, one of which passes upwards to be attached to the body of the vertebra above ; the lower one passes to the body of the vertebra below ; while the intermediate one passes horizontally forwards to the intervertebral disc. In the three lower ribs the fasciculi are not separately distin- guishable, although the fibres pass upwards to the vertebrse and downwards to the vertebra with which the rib articulates. Some anatomists describe a capsular ligament surrounding the articulation; the fibres are very thin, and form part of the costo- central ligament. Fig. 72. 1, 1, 1. Superior costo- transverse ligaments. 2, 2, 2. Anterior costo-cen- tral or stellate ligaments. COSTO-VEETEBEAL LIGAMENTS. 2. An interartimlar ligament which passes across the joint from the ridge on the head of the rib to the intervertebral cartilage. It divides the articulation into two joints which do not communicate with each other. It is absent in the three lower articulations. The ligaments connecting these bones are the capsular, the anterior, middle and posterior costo- transverse. The capsular ligament surrounds the articular surfaces of the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of its corresponding vertebra, and has a synovial membrane. It is absent in the eleventh and twelfth ribs. The anterior or superior costo-transverse ligament ascends from AUTICTmATIONS OF THE Neck and TUBEKCLE OF THE ElBS WITH THE Transvebse Peo- CE8SES.

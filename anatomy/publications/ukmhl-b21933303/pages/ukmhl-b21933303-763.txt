CONVOLUTIONS OF THE CEKEBRUM, 739 The convolutions on the external surface are tliree :— The mperior, middle, and inferior occipital convolutions (fig. 175, c),, o.„ O3) run nearly horizontally backwards, and are separated by the superior and inferior occipital fissures ; anteriorly these convo - lutions are continuous with the parietal and temjDoro-sphenoidal convolutions,. through the four annectent gyri. The first three have been previously described ; the lowest or fourth connects the inferior occipital with the inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolution. Fig. 177.

There is usually a small, shallow, vertical fissure, the transverse occi])ital, which passes down behind the external parieto-occipital fissure. On the median plane is the cuneate lohvle, which forms part of the occipital lobe, and will be described further on. The temporo-sphenoidal lobe is bounded in front and above by 3 B 2

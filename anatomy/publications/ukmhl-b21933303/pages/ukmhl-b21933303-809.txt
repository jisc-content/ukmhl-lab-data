Along the anterior median fissure may be traced a well-marked fibrous band, formed by the pia mater, which has been named the linea splendens. Below the level of the second lumbar vertebra, the pia mater is continued as a slender filament, called the filum termmale, or central ligament, which runs down in the middle of the bundle of nerves into which the spinal cord breaks up. About the level of the third sacral vertebra it becomes continuous with the dura mater of the cord, and is then prolonged as far as the base of the coccyx. The spine of the third sacral vertebra marks the level to which the cerebro-spinal fluid descends in the vertebral canal. It is supplied with nerves from the sympathetic and from the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. LiGAiiENTTjir From each side of the DENTICULATUM. cord along its whole length there runs a fibrous band, ligamentum den- timlatum, which gives off" a series of pro- cesses to steady and support the cord. They are triangular, their bases being attached to the cord, and their points to the inside of the dura mater (fig. 195). There are from eighteen to twenty-two of them on each side, and they lie between the anterior and pos- terior roots of the spinal nerves. The first process passes between the vertebral artery and the hypoglossal nerve; the last is found at the termination of the cord. It is composed of fibrous tissue, and is covered with nucleated cells continuous with the arachnoid membrane.' ' Vide Axel Key and Eetzius; Max Schultze's Archives, 1873.

838 DISSECTION OF TEE SCROTUM AND TESTIS. The scrotum is a poucli of skin for tlie lodgment of the two testes. ^ They are originally developed in the abdomen, and descend into the scrotum about the eighth month of intra-uterine life. In their descent they push before them certain coverings derived from the strata of the abdominal â– walls, through which they pass, and which constitute, with the layers of the scrotum, the coverings of the testes. The scrotum presents in the middle a ridge, the ra]jhe, on each side of which it is corrugated into transverse folds or rugce. It is divided by a dis- tinct septum into two lateral halves, of which the left is the longer. The scrotum consists of two layers, the integument and the dartos. The iHtcgument is of dark colour, thrown into transverse ruga), and provided with sebaceous glands and hairs. The dartos is a thin layer, consisting of muscular fibres of the involuntary kind, like those of the bladder and intestines. It serves to corrugate the loose and extensible skin of the scrotum, and in a measure to support and brace the testes. It is more abundant in the anterior than the posterior part of the scrotum. Beneath the dartos, and partly intermingled with it, is a large quantity of loose connective tissue, remarkable for the total absence of fat. Together with the dartos it forms a vertical partition between the testes, termed the septum scroti, which passes from the raphe to the under aspect of the penis, as far as its root. It is not a complete partition, since air or fluid will pass from one side to the other. The great abundance and looseness of this tissue explains the enormous swelling of the scrotum in cases of anasarca, and in cases where urine is extravasated into it in consequence of rupture or ulceration of the urethra. The coverings of the testes, in addition to these two layers of the

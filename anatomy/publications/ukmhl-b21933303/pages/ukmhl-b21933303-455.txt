RECTUS ABDOMINIS. 431 fascia, showing that it divides into three layers : the posterior layer, attached to the tips of the spinous processes, gives attachment to the internal oblique, and is continuous with the aponeurosis of the serratus posticus inferior and latissimus dorsi; the middle layer attached to the tips of the transverse processes, and the anterior layer—very thin—attached to the anterior aspect of the bases of the transverse processes. Between the anterior and middle layer is the quadratus lumborum ; between the middle and posterior, the erector spinte. Eectus This long muscle is situated vertically in front Abdominis. of the abdomen, and is enclosed in a sheath formed by the aponeuroses of the lateral muscles of the abdomen, and Fig. 100.

To expose it, there- fore, slit up the middle of the sheath, and reflect the two halves. It arises by two tendons, the inner and smaller of which is attached to the front of the symphysis, the outer to the crest of the os jDubis. As the fibres pass up, the muscle becomes broader and thinner, and is inserted into the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages. Notice the tendinous intersections across the muscle called linear transversce, which are incomplete repetitions of the ribs in the wall

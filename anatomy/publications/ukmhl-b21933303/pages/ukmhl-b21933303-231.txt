207 CORONARY ARTERIES. ventricular orifices. There are only tAvo muscidi 'papillares: one attached to the anterior, the other to the posterior wall of the ventricle. They are thicker, and their chordce tendinece stronger, than those of the right ventricle, but their arrangement is precisely similar. From the upper and back part of the ventricle, a smooth passage leads to the orifice of the aorta. This orifice is placed in the groove between the two auricles, and somewhat in front and to the right side of the left auriculo-ventricular opening. The two orifices are close together, and only separated by the larger flap of the mitral valve. The aortic orifice is guarded by three semilunar valves, of which the arrangement, structure, and mode of action are similar to those of the pulmonary, artery. Their framework is proportionately stronger, consistently with the greater strength of the left ventricle, and the greater impulse of the blood. In the sinuses of Valscdva are observed the orifices of the two coronary arteries; the left arising from the sinus behind the left postei'ior segment; the right from behind the anterior segment.

CoRONAKY The heart is supplied with blood by the two Aetebies. coronary arteries, a right or posterior, and a left or anterior. They are about the size of a crow's quill. Both arise from the aorta just above the free -margins of the two semilunar valves, and thus always allow the passage of blood; both run in the furrows on the surface of the heart; both are accompanied by the cardiac nerves and by lymphatics. The anterior or left coronary artery, the smaller of the two, arises from behind the left posterior valve of the aortic orifice. It appears between the pulmonary artery and the appendix of the left auricle, and then divides into two branches: one which seems the continuation of the main trunk and runs down the inter- ventricular furrow on the anterior surface of the heart to the apex; the other passes transversely to the left, in the left auriculo- ventricular groove to the back of the heart. * Dr. Peacock, Croonian Lectures, 1866.

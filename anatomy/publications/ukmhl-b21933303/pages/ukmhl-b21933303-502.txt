THE DIAPHRAGM. 478 converge to it from all sides (fig. 112). Tlie diaphragm arises, 1. From the ensiform cartilage by fleshy fibres; 2. From the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the six lower ribs by as many digita- tions, which correspond with those of the transversalis; 3. From two thin tendinous arches, called, respectively, the ligamenta arcuata, externum and internum (the external arch is the thickened upper border of the anterior layer of the transversalis fascia, and extends from the last rib to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra, and arches over the quadratus lumborum; the internal passes from the transverse process of the first lumbar ver- FiG. 112. 1.

From the front of the bodies of the lumbar vertebraB by two elongated bundles, called the crura of the diaphragm. Both crura have tendinous origins ; the right crus is, however, a little longer than the left; the former arises from the first, second, and third lumbar vertebra and their intervening cartilages; the left does not descend so low by one vertebra. The inner fibres of each crus- decussate; those of the right being the more anterior. In their decussation the fibres separate the aortic from the oesophageal openings. Between the two crura the aorta enters the abdomen. From these various origins the fibres ascend, at first nearly ver-

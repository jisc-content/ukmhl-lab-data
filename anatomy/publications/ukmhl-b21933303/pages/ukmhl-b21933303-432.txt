LIGAMENTS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. head of the radius admits not only of flexion and extension, but of central rotation, upon the rounded articular eminence (ca^oitelhim) of the humerus, and of peripheral rotation at the sujjerior radio- ulnar articulation. The joint is secured in front and behind by anterior and posterior ligaments, and laterally by two strong lateral ligaments. No ligament is attached to the head of the radius, otherwise its rotatory movement would be impeded. The head is simply sur- rounded by a ligamentous collar, called the annular ligament, within which it freely rolls in pronation and supination of the hand.

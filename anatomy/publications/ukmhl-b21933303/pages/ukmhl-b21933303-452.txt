428 INTERNAL OBLIQUE. recognised by the difference in the direction of its fibres, which run upwards and inwards. Internal This is thinner than the last-named muscle, and Oblique, arises by fleshy fibres from the outer half or more of Poupart's ligament, from the anterior two-thirds of the middle lip of the crest of the ilium, and from the posterior aponeurosis of the transversalis muscle (fascia lumborum). The fibres radiate from their origin, the anterior ones passing transversely forwards, the posterior ones ascending nearly vertically. The fibres are inserted Fig. 90. 1.

DIAGRAM OF THE LOWER FIBRES OF THE INTERNAL OBLIQUE AND TRANSVERSALIS, WITH THE CEE5USTER MUSCLE. in the following manner: the anterior fibres (which arise from Poupart's ligament) passinwards^ and arch over the spermatic cord, descending somewhat to be inserted, in common with the tendon of the transversalis muscle, into the crest of the os pubis, and for a short distance into the linea ilio-pectinea immediately behind the external ring; the middle fibres (which arise from the anterior iliac spine and front of its crest) are directed transversely inwards, to be attached to an aponeurosis which passes to the linea alba; the posterior fibres ascend nearly vertically to be attached into

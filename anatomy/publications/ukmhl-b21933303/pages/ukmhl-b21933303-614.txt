STRUCTURE OF THE KIDNEY. 590 portion, and is soft and easily lacerated. It forms the external portion of the kidney to the extent of four to five lines, arching over the bases of the pyramirls. It moreover sends down prolonga- tions between the pjTamids as far as the sinus, forming the se2:)tula renum or the columns of Bertini. The cortical substance consists of convoluted and straight tubes, tuhuli uriniferi, of little reddish granules called Maljnghian bodies, and of blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphatics (fig. 139). The meclidlary structure is composed of numerous conical masses, the pyramids of MalphjU, having their bases directed to the surface, their sides in relation with the columns of Bertini, and their apices, termed papUkti or mammillce, projecting into one of the calices of the ureter. The pyramids, of which there are from eight to sixteen, are surrounded by the cortical substance; they are composed of minute straight tubules (which proceed from the cortical portion to end in the papillEe), of looped tubes described by Henle, and of arteries and veins.' At the hilum is the dilated commencement of the ureter, called the pelvis of the kidriey. It is funnel-shaped, and its broad part divides into three principal channels, infimdihula, an upper, middle, and lower, which again branch, and form from eight to twelve cup- SECTION OP THE KIDNEY. 1.

In the human subject the lobes gradually coalesce, and no trace of their primordial state remains, except the pyramidal arrangement of the tubes. But in the kidneys of the lower mammalia, of birds and reptiles, the lobes are permanently separate.

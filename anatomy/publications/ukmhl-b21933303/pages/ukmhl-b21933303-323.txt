LIGAMENTS BETWEEN OCCIPITAL BONE AND AXIS. 299 dura mater, and is pierced by the vertebral artery and the sub- occipital nerve. The two lateral ligaments pass from the jugular eminences of the occiput, downwards and outwards to the transverse processes of the atlas. The capsular ligaments extend from the margin of the condyles of the occipital bone to the upper articular borders of the atlas. The movements which take place between the occipital bone and the atlas are flexion and extension, as in nodding forwards and backwards; and lateral movement, as in inclining the head side- ways.

Ligaments These are the most important; and to see them, BETWEEN THE the spiual canal must be exposed by removing the OccipiT^u, Bone posterior arches of the upper cervical vertebrae, and and the xis. ^j^g posterior common ligament, which is here very thick and strong. It ascends from the posterior surface of the axis, then passes over the odontoid and transverse ligaments, and is attached to the basilar process of the occipital bone. It is called the occipito-axial ligament, or the apparatxis ligamentosus colli. Odontoid or The odontoid or cJiecJc ligaments (fig. 71) are Check Ligaments, two very strong ligaments, which proceed from the sides of the odontoid process to the tubercles on the inner

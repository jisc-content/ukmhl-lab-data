11 SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER. that tliey are admirably adapted to resist tlie pressure of the brain. There are fifteen of these sinuses, and they Fig. 4. are classified into two groups—a supero- jjosterior and an infero-anterior. The supero- posterior group comprises the superior lon- gitudinal, the inferior longitudinal, the straight, the lateral, and the occipital sinuses; while the infero-anterior group includes the cavernous, the circular, the superior and inferior petrosal, and the straight sinuses. Of these fifteen sinuses, five are pairs and five are single, as follows:— DIAGRAM TO SHOW FOUMA- TION OF A SINUS. The five pairs of sinuses are - The lateral. The superior petrosal. The inferior petrosal. The cavernous. The occipital. The five single sinuses are— The superior longitudinal. The inferior longitudinal. The circular. The transverse. The straight. I Fig. 5. The blood from all these sinuses is eventually discharged into the internal jugular veins. Superior Lon- This runs along the upper attached border of GiiuDiNAL Sinus. the falx cerebri (fig. 5). It begins very small at the foramen c£ecum, gradually increases in size in its course back- wards, and opposite the internal protuberance of the occipital bone opens into a triangular dilata- tion, the torcular Heropliili, or the confluence of the sinuses. It then divides into the right and left lateral sinuses, the right being generally the larger. Besides numerous veins from the cancel- lous texture of the skull-cap, the superior longitudinal sinus re- ceives large veins from the upper part of each hemisphere of the cerebrum, and an emissary vein through the parietal foramen. It is interesting to observe that these veins run (as a rule) from behind forwards, contrary to the 1. Superior loiigitndinal siuus. 2. Inferior longitudinal eiiius. 3. Straight siuus. i, 4.

The siqjerficial portion of this ligament is attached above to the margin of the internal malleolus, and passing downwards ra- diates to be inserted into the scaphoid, the inner side of the astragalus, tlie sustentaculum tali, and the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligament; the deeper portion, thick and strong, passes from the tip of the malleolus to the astra- galus, close to its articular border. The external lateral ligament con- sists of three distinct fasciculi, an an- terior, a posterior, and a middle (fig- 166). The anterior fasciculus passes from the front of the tip of the external malleolus, nearly horizontally forwards Fig. 166. DIAGHAU OF THE ESTEENAL LATEUAL LIGASIENT. 1. Anterior part. 2.

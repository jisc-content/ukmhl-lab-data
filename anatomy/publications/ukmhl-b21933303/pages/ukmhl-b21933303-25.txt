A MANUAL OF THE DISSECTION OF THE HUMAN BODY. DISSECTION OF THE SCALP. An mciSiON sliould be made from the root of the Dissection nose along the mesial line of the vertex to the external protuberance of the occipital bone ; another, horizontally- round each half of the head, to join at right angles the two ends of the first incision. These incisions must not divide more than the skin, so that the subcutaneous vessels and nerves be not injured. It is well to dissect on one side of the head the muscles only, re- serving the other side for the dissection of the vessels and nerves. Strata compos- The several strata of tissues covering the skull- iNG THE Scalp. cap areâ€”1, the sMn; 2, a thin layer of connective tissue and fat which contains the cutaneous vessels and nerves and the bulbs of the hair; and by which the skin is very closely con- nected to, 3, the broad thin aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis muscle (aponeurosis of the scalp) ; 4, an abundance of loose connec- tive tissue, which permits the free motion of the scalp upon, 5, the pericranium, or periosteum of the skull-cap. ' Immediately beneath the skin, then, we expose the thin stratum of connective and adipose tissue which firmly connects it with the aponeurosis of the scalp. This layer is continuous behind with the superficial fascia covering the muscles at the back of the neck, and laterally it passes over the temporal fascia. It forms a bed for the bulbs of the hair and for the ramifications of the cutaneous arteries. B

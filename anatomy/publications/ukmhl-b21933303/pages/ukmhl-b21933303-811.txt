787 THE SPINAL CORD. twelfth dorsal vertebra, and is largest opposite the last dorsal vertebra.' The cord is divided into two symmetrical halves by a median longitudinal fissure in front and behind (fig. 196). The anterior assure is the more distinct and wider, and penetrates about one- third of the substance of the cord; deeper in the lower than in the upper part of the cord. It contains a fold of pia mater, with many blood-vessels for the supply of its interior. At the bottom of this fissure is a transverse layer of white substance, named the anterior white commissure, connecting the two anterior halves of the cord. The posterior fissure is much less apparent than the anterior, and is better marked in the upper and the lower parts of the cord. It does not contain a fold of pia mater, but contains a thin septum of Fig. 196. DIAGEAM OF A THANSVEESE SECTION THEOUGH THE SPINAL COED AND ITS MEMBEANES. 1. Dura mater. 4.

Anterior branch of spinal nerve. connective tissue with blood-vessels. It can be traced to a greater depth than the anterior, and reaches down as far as the posterior grey commissure of the cord. Besides the anterior and posterior fissures, is another superficial lateral groove, from which the posterior roots of the spinal nerves emerge ; this is termed the postero-lateral groove (fig. 196). This leads down to the posterior horn of the grey matter in the interior ' In very early foetal life these enlargements do not exist, and only make their I appearance with the development of the extremities. 3 E 2

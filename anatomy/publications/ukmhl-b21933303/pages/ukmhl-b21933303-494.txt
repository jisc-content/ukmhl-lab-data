470 COMMON BILE DUCT. Fia. 110. Hepatic Duct. receiving the veins corresponding to tlie branches of the hepatic artery, the vena portse returns its blood into the inferior vena cava through the vente cavae hepaticaa. The veins which empty themselves into the vena portse have no valves. Therefore, if any obstruction arises in the venous circulation through the liver, the roots of the portal vein are apt to become congested: this is a common cause of haemorrhoids, diarrhoea, hae- morrhage from the bowels, and ascites. The he- patic duct is formed by the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts, which issue from the trans- verse fissure. The hepatic duct descends nearly verti- cally for about an inch and a half, when it is joined at an acute angle by the cystic duct. The cystic duct, about an inch in length, descends, from the neck of the gaU bladder, towards the left in the gastro-hepatic omentum, lying to the right of the hepatic artery and in front of the vena portse. The Ductus Com- hepatic and cystic ducts unite to form the ducti( MUNIS Chole- communis choledocJms, or the common bUe duct DocHus. the duct thus formed, passes downwards and to the left, between the two layers of the lesser omentum, close to its right border. It is about three inches long, and if distended would be about the size of a crow-quill. It descends behind the Cystic Duct. DIAGRiM OF THE VENA POET^.

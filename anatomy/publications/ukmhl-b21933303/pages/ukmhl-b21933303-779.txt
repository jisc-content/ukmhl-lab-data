CORPUS CALLOSUM, 755 it is thicker at the ends than in the middle, and thicker behind than in Tront. A shallow groove, called the raphe, runs along the middle of its upper surface (fig. 182) ; in a fresh brain, two longi- tudinal white tracts, named strice longitudinales or the nerves of Laiicisi, run parallel to it; and external to these again are two other longitudinal fibres, strice longitudinales laterales. The sur- face of the corpus callosum is marked by transverse lines which indicate the course of its fibres; these are the linece transoersoe of Fig. 184. tiin of Monro . ^commissure . •ir commissure cluerea . .

The anterior cerebral arteries proceed along ! the surface of the corpus callosum to the back of the brain. The anterior part of the corpus callosum turns downwards land backwards, forming a bend called its genu. The inferior \ part of this bend—rostrum—becomes gradually thinner and nar- li rower, and terminates in two peduncles, which diverge from each |cother, and are lost, one in. each fissure of Sylvius, Between these 3 c 2

837 THE MAMMARY GLAND. into lobules, and the duct branches out accordingly.' Traced to their origin, we find that the ducts commence in clusters of minute cells, and that the blood-vessels ramify minutely upon these cells ; altogether, then, a single lobe might be compared to a bunch of grapes, of which the stalk represents the main duct. The main ducts (fjaladophorous duds) from the several lobes, from fifteen to twenty in number, converge towards the nipple, and, just before they reach it, become dilated into small sacs or ampullce, two or three lines wide ; after this they run up to the apex of the nipple, and, running parallel, terminate in separate orifices. The vesicles and the galactophorous ducts are lined with columnar epithelium, except at their orifices, where it becomes squamous. The arteries of the gland are derived from the long thoracic, the internal mammary, and the intercostals; the nerves come from the anterior and lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves, and from the descending branches of the cervical plexus. The veins diverge from the nipple, and terminate in the axillary and internal mammary veins. The lymphatics run chiefly to the axillary glands, but some jDierce the front of the intercostal spaces to join the anterior mediastinal glands. ' It is observed, in some cases, that one or more lobules run off to a consider- able distance from the main body of the gland, and lie embedded in the subcu- taneous tissue. This should be remembered when it is necessary to remove the entire gland.

TEMPORAL AND PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGIONS. 127 the median, tlie ulnar, the internal cutaneous, and the lesser in- ternal cutaneous (nerve of Wrisberg) nerves; from the posterior cord, the three subscapular (to the subscapularis, the latissimus dorsi, and teres major), the circumflex (to the deltoid and teres minor) and the musculo-spiral nerves: all of which will be described more fully in the dissection of the upper extremity. TEMPOEAL AND PTERYGO-MAXILLAEY REGIONS. In this dissection, the parts should be examined in the following order:— 1. Superficial and deep fasciae. 2. Superficial arteries and nerves of the temple. 3. Masseter muscle. 4. Temporal aponeurosis. 5. Temporal muscle. 6. Pterygoid muscles. 7. Internal maxillary artery and branches. 8. Inferior maxillary nerves and branches. To expose the temporal region, the skin of the temple should be reflected from below upwards. Beneath the skin you come upon a layer of tough connective tissue, continuous, above, with the aponeurosis of the scalp; below, with the fascia covering the masseter and the parotid gland. In this tissue are contained the superficial temporal vessels and nerves. Temporai, This is the smaller of the two terminal branches Aktery. of the external carotid. Arising in the substance of the parotid gland near the neck of the jaw, it passes over the root of the zygoma, close to the meatus auditorius externus, ascends for about 1-| inches on the temporal fascia, and there divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. Above the zygoma it is superficial, being covered only by the attrahens aurem and a strong layer of fascia; here it is accompanied by branches of the facial nerve, and by the auriculo-temporal branch of the inferior division of the fifth nerve. It gives off" the following branches:— a. Several small branches to the parotid gland, the temporo-maxil- lary articulation, and the masseter.

183 VENA AZYGOS MINOK. Fig. 44. Lth I our ^ INTERCOS': V'J BRONCHUS receives nine or ten of the lower intercostal veins of the right side, the spinal veins, the posterior mediastinal, the oesophageal and the right bronchial veins. Opposite the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra it is joined by the left vena azy- gos. It is occasionally connected with the right superior intercostal vein. The lefb vena azygos, vena azygos minor, runs up the left side of the spine. This vein commences in the abdomen from one of the lumbar veins of the left side, or from the left renal. It then ascends on the left side of the aorta, through the left eras of the diaphragm. On a level with the sixth or seventh dorsal vertebra, it passes beneath the aorta and thoracic duct to join the azygos major. Before passing beneath the aorta it usuallj' communicates with the left superior intercostal vein. It generally receives six or seven of the lower intercostal veins of the left side, the oesophageal and mediastinal veins. These azygos veins are provided with imperfect valves, and are supplemental to the inferior vena cava. The left upper azygos vein re- ceives the intercostal veins of the left side, usually from the fourth to the sixth; it communicates above with the left superior intercostal vein, and opens below, either directly into the vena azygos major, or indirectly into it through the vena azygos minor.

781 SPINAL VEINS, venes, ■which is filled with a soft reddish-looking fat, with watery cellular tissue, and the ramifications of a plexus of veins. Spinai. System The spine is remarkable for the number of large OF Veins. and tortuous veins which ramify about it, inside and outside the vertebral canal (fig. 193). They are :— 1. The dorsi-spinal or posterior external veins, which form a tortuous plexus outside the spinous, transverse, and articular pro- cesses, and the arches of the vertebrae ; they communicate with corresponding veins above and below, and they send off branches, which pass through the ligamenta subflava and intervertebral foramina, and end in the plexus inside the vertebral canal. They join the vertebral veins in the cervical region, the intercostal in the dorsal, and the lumbar and sacral veins below. 3. Posterior longitudinal spinal veins. 4. Anterior longitudinal spinal veins. DIAGRAM OF THE SPINAL VEINS. (VEETICAL SECTION.) 2. The veins of the bodies of the vertehrce (yence basis verte- h'ariim), emerge from the backs of the bodies, and empty them- selves into the transverse vein connecting the two anterior longi- tudinal spinal veins. 3. The anterior longitudinal sjnnal veins, two in number, one on each side, are very large tortuous veins, which extend along the whole length of the spinal canal. They communicate by trans- verse branches, passing beneath the posterior common ligament, opposite the body of each vertebra, where they receive the venaa basis vertebrarum. They are larger in the dorsal and lumbar regions, and communicate externally with the vertebral, the inter- costal, the lumbar, and the sacral veins. Pig. 193. 1. Anterior external veins. 2.

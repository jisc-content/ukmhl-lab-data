In the cliild, the bladder being more an abdominal than a pelvic viscus, the curve forms part of a much smaller circle than in the adult; but it gradually widens as age increases, and catheters are shaped accordingly.' However, the parts, when in a sound state, will yield sufficiently to admit the introduction of a straight instrument into the bladder. A straight staff is some- times used in lithotomy. In its contracted state, the sides of the urethra are in closej apposition; the appearance it presents on a transverse sectior differs in the different parts of its course. Through the glansj it is flattened vertically ; through the prostate it is crescentic,' with its convexity upwards, owing to the veru montanum. But throughout the rest of its course the canal exhibits on section the appearance of a transverse slit (fig. 133). Fig. 133. TRANSVERSE SECTIONS OF THE DRETHEA. A. Through the prostate. d. Through the corpus sppngiosum. c. Through the glans penis. The urethra must be laid open from end to end along its roof, to see that the canal is not of uniform calibre throughout. The external orifice is the narrowest and the least dilatable part; so that the urine may be expelled in a jet. Therefore, any instru- ment which will enter the meatus ought to pass into the bladder, if there be no stricture. The junction of the membranous with the bulbous part is almost as narrow. The prostatic ijortion of the urethra has been described with the ' The sharper curve of the urethra in the child was well known to Camper. ' In recenter natis, vesica basi sua elatius sita, pedetentim descendit, unde neces- sario sequitur curvaturam urethrte majorem esse in junioribus quam in adultis. â€” Demon. Anat.

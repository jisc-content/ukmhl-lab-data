INTERCOSTAL NERVES. 192 BoBSAii Neeves. Fio. 46. PCST'ROOT POST'B ANT? ROOT to each other in the intercostal space, is, that the vein lies upper- most, the nerve lowest, and the artery between them. The dorsal nerves are twelve in number, the first emerging between the first and second dorsal vertebrae, and do not^fi^rm a plexus as in the cervical, lumbar and sacral regions. Each dorsal nerve (like all the spinal nerves) arises from the spinal cord by two roots, an anterior or motor, and a posterior or sensory. The sensory root has a ganglion upon it. The two roots unite in the intervertebral foramen and form a compound nerve. After passing through the foramen, it is con- nected by two filaments with the sympathetic nerve, and then divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The posterior or dorsal branches pass back- wards between the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebra? and divide into internal and external branches: the internal branches pass between the multi- fidus spinse and semispinalis dorsi, pierce the rliomboidei and tra- pezius muscles ; the six upper branches become cutaneous at the spinous processes of the ver- tebras ; the six lower supply only the multifidus spinae, not giving off any cutaneous filaments; the external branches pass through the longissimus dorsi and supply this muscle, the ilio-costalis and their continuations and the levatores costarum ; the six lower branches, in addition, distribute cutaneous filaments to the skin. These branches will be described more fully later on in the dissection of the back. Intercostal The intercostal nerves are the anterior divisions Nerves. of the dorsal nerves, and are twelve in number. Each nerve receives a filament from the sympathetic, and then proceeds between the intercostal muscles in company with, and immediately below, the corresponding artery. Midway between A NT* CUT?

842 THE TESTIS. composed of white fibrous tissue, interlacing in every direction; analogous to the sclerotic coat of the eye. It completely invests the testis, but not the epididymis. It is covered by the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis, except behind and at the attachments of the epididymis. At the posterior part of the gland it penetrates into its substance for a short distance, and forms an incomplete vertical septum, termed, after the anatomist who first discovered it, corpus Highmorianum, and subsequently by Sir A. Cooper, mediastinum testis (fig. 208, 5). The mediastinum testis transmits the blood-vessels of the organ, and contains also the network of seminal ducts, called the Pio. 208. 1. Spermatic artery. 2. Vas deferens. 3. Deferential artery. 4. Epididymis. 5. Mediastinum testis. 6. fi. Cavity of tuuioa vaginalis. TKAN9VERSE SECTION THROUGH THE LEFT TESTICLE. (The dots show the reflections oÂ£ the tunica vaginalis.) rete , testis, shown in the diagram (fig. 207). This septum gives oif from its front and sides a number of diverging slender fibrous cords, trabeculce testis,^ which traverse the interior of the gland, and are attached to the inside of the tunica albugiuea. They serve to maintain the general shape of the testicle, to support the numerous lobules of which its glandular substance is composed, and to convey the blood-vessels into it. These septa, as weU as the mediastinum from which they proceed, are readily seen on making a transverse section through the gland (fig. 208). ' Kolliker has demonstrated unstriped muscular fibres upon the septa as well as the mediastinum.

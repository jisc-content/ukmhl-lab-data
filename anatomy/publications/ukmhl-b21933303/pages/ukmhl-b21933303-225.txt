A more or less noticeable fold of the lining membrane, the Eustachian valve,^ may be seen projecting from -the front margin of the V. c. inferior to the front border of the fossa ovalis. It is placed between the inferior vena cava and the lower margin of the annulus ovalis. Curved in shape, it passes forwards and ends in two cornua; of which, one is attached to the annulus ovalis, the other is lost on the wall of the auricle. It consists of a reduplica- tion of the endocardium and contains some muscular tissue. It is Fig. 48. Auriculo-ventricular orifice. . Fossa ovalis Opening of the coronary vein .

To the left of the Eustachian valve, that is, between its remains and the auriculo-ventricular opening, is the orifice of the coronary sinus. The sinus is about an inch in length and receives the great cardiac vein, the posterior cardiac vein, and the oblique vein (of Marshall), and will nearly admit the end of the little finger. It is surrounded by muscular fibres, and is guarded by a semi- circular fold of the endocardium, called the valve of Thehesius,^ ' Eustachius, Libell, de Vena sine Pari. ^ This valve is occasionally double.

LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. 702 Fig. 163. tibia (fig. 163). A few of tlie deeper fibres axe attaclied to the inner semilunar cartilage, and serve to keep it in place. The inferior internal articular artery, and part of the tendon of the semimembranosus, pass underneath this ligament. In the several motions of the joint, there is a certain amount of friction between the ligament and the head of the tibia, and consequently a small bursa is interposed. External The loiig external Lateral lateral ligament is a Ligaments. strong round band which extends from the outer condyle of the femur to the outer part of the head of the fibula. This ligament sepa- rates the two divisions of the tendinous insertion of the biceps. Beneath it pass the tendon of the popliteus and the inferior external articular artery. The short external lateral ligament is situated posterior to, and runs parallel with, the preceding ligament; it passes from the posterior and outer part of the condyle of the femur to the tip of the styloid process of the fibula ; the tendon of the popliteus also lies beneath it. Posterior This, which is generally called the ligamentum Ligament. iMsticum Winslowii, covers the whole of the pos- terior surface of the knee-joint, and consists of two portionsâ€”one formed by a broad flat band of vertical fibres passing from the posterior surface of the femur between and above the condyles to the posterior j)art of the tuberosity of the tibia; the other con- sists of an oblique tendinous expansion from the semimembranosus (p. 670), which passes upwards and outwards from the internal tuberosity of the tibia to the back of the outer condyle of the femur. It is pierced by numerous blood-vessels to supply the knee-joint, chiefly by the azygos artery and a branch from the diagram of the sbmhiunar cartilages and lateral li- gaments OF THE KNEE. 1.

The form of the articulation of the lower jaw admits of move- ment, upwards and downwards, forwards,, backwards, and from side to side. A combination of these movements takes place in masti- cation : during this act the condyles of the jaw describe an oblique rotatory movement in the glenoid cavity. The purposes served by the fibro-cartilage in this joint are :â€”first, it follows the condyle, Fig. 74.

Its nerves are derived from the auriculo-temporal, and the masseteric branches of the inferior maxillary. The stylo-hyoid and stylo-maxillary ligaments have been pre- viously described.

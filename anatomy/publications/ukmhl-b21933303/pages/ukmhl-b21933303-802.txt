THE CEUEHELLUM. 778 lamina). This racemose arrangement of the white matter in the substance of the grey has been likened to the branches of a tree deprived of its leaves, and is generally known as the arhor vitca. Corpus Dkn- In the centre of the white substance of each ■''^TUM. hemisphere is a nucleus of grey matter, the cordis dentatiim, consisting of a zigzag line of yellowish-grey colour, incomplete at its upper and inner part, and enclosing within it some white substance. From its centre white fibres may be traced to the superior cerebellar peduncles and the valve of Vieussens. It is displayed either by a vertical or by a horizontal section. Eespecting the function of the cerebellum, the deductions derived from comparative anatomy and physiological experiments render it probable that it is the co-ordinator of muscular movements—e.g., in walking, flying, and swimming. The encephalon is originally developed from three primary vesicles, from which the following parts are, in the later stages, severally developed:— 1. Anterior vesicle 2. Middle vesicle 3. Posterior vesicle Prosencephalon Thalamencephalon Mesencephalon Epencephalon .Metencephalon Cerebral hemispheres, corpora striata, corpus callosum, fornix, lateral ventricles, olfactory lobe. Optic tlialami, pineal body, pitui- tary body, third ventricle, optic nerve. Corpora quadrigemina, crura cei'e- bri, aqueduct of Sylvius, optic nerve. Cerebellum, pons Varolii, front part of the fourth ventricle. IMedulla oblongata, posterior part of the fourth ventricle, auditory nerve. The component parts of the encephalon begin to be developed at different periods of foetal life, and the ages at which they severally begin to appear are given as follows :—

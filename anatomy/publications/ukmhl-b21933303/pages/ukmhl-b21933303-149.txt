BRANCHES OF THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 125 nerves (namely, tlie fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical) unite to form the 2^ost'}rior cord} The branches arising from the plexus are best arranged into those given ofi" above the clavicle, and those given ofi" below it. The following are those given off above the clavicle. Fig. 32. DIAGRAM OF THE FOHlLiTION OF THE BKAOHIAIi PLEXUS AND ITS BEANCHES. C 4-8. Anterior trunks of the cervical nerves. D 1.

The branch forming one of the roots of the phrenic arises from the fifth cervical. (Not in the diagram.) h. Nerve to the subclavius m.â€”This proceeds from the fifth and sixth cervical, and crosses the subclavian artery in the third part ' Very frequently the posterior branch of the eighth cervical nerve does not, stricfly speaking, form part of the posterior cord, but is continued on as a separate fasciculus to form part of the musculo-spiral nerve. Por a description of the arrangement of the nerves constituting the plexus, see a paper, by Lucas, Oiiy''s Hospital Bcports, 1875 ; also Turner in the Journal of Anatomy, 1872.

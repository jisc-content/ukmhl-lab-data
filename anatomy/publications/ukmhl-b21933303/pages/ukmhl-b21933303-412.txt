388 FASCIA ON THE JJACK OF THE FOREARM. The cutaneous veins, from the back of the hand and forearm ^ join the venous plexus at the bend of the elbow (see p. 327).

The dwsal branch of the ulnar nerve passes beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, pierces the fascia just above the wrist-joiat, runs over the posterior annular ligament of the wrist, and divides upon the back of the hand into filaments, which supply both sides of the back of the little finger, the ring finger, and the ulnar side of the middle finger. The radial nerve passes obliquely beneath the tendon of the supinator longus, perforates the fascia about two inches above the wrist-joint, and subdivide^ into filaments, which supply both sides of the back of the thumb and forefinger, and the radial side of the middle finger.^ The radial nerve commonly gives off, on the back of the hand, a branch which joins the nearest branch of the ulnar.

It is attached to the condyles of the humerus and to the olecranon, and is strengthened by an expansion from the tendon of the triceps. Along the forearm it is attached to the ridge on the posterior part of the ulna. Its upper third gives origin to the fibres of the muscles beneath â–  The relative share -which the radial and ulnar nerves take in supplying the fingers varies. Under any arrangement the thumb and each finger'has two dorsal nerves, one on either side, of whioh the terminal branches reach the root of the nail. They supply filaments to the skin on the back of the finger, and have fre- quent communications with the palmar digital nerves. In some instances one or more of the dorsal nerves do *not extend beyond the first phalanx : their place is then supplied by a branch from the palmar nerve.

54 MUSCLES OF THE ORBIT, rectus. The anterior part of the gland lies sometimes separated from the rest, close to the back part of the upper eyelid, and is covered by the conjunctiva. The gland is invested by a capsule ' formed by the fascia of the orbit. The lachrymal gland consists of an aggregation of small lobes composed of smaller lobules, connected by fibro-cellular tissue, and resembles the structure of the sali- vary glands. The excretory ducts, seven to ten in number, run parallel, and perforate the conjunctiva in a row, about a quarter of an inch above the edge of the tarsal cartilage (fig. 21). They are not easily dis- covered in the human eye; in that of the horse or bullock they are large enough to admit a small probe. The secretion of the gland keeps the surface of the cornea constantly moist and polished; but if dust, or any foreign substance, irritate the eye, the teai'S flow in abundance, and wash it off. All the muscles of the orbit, with the exception of the inferior oblique, arise from the margin of the foramen opticum, and pass forwards, like ribands, to their insertions. Levator This muscle arises from the roof of the orbit, Palpebb^. above and in front of the optic foramen. It gradually increases in breadth, and terminates in a broad, thin ajjoneurosis, which is inserted into the upper surface of the tarsal cartilage beneath the palpebral ligament. It is constantly in action when the eyes are open, in order to counteract the ten- dency of the lids to fall. As sleep approaches, the muscle relaxes, the eyes feel heavy, and the lids close. Its nerve comes from the superior division of the third nerve, and enters it on its under or ocular aspect. ' This capsule, being a little stronger on the under surface of the gland, is described and figured by Sommerring as a distinct ligament, Iconcs OcuU Humani, tab. vii.

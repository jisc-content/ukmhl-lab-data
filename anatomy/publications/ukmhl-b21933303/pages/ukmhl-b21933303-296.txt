The loiuer is elongated, and curved upon itself in such a way as to form not only half the apex, but the outer and inner boundaries of the external opening of the nostrils. Superiorly, it Fia. 65. E.

By their elasticity these several cartilages keep the nostrils continually open, and restore them to their ordinary size whenever they have been expanded by muscular action. The cartilage of the septum is placed perpendicularly in the middle line ; it may lean a little, however, to one side or the other, and in some instances it is perforated, so that the two nasal cavities communicate with each other. The cartilage is smooth and flat, and its outline is nearly triangular. The posterior border is re- ceived into a groove in the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid; the anterior border is much thicker than the rest of the septum, and is connected, superiorly, with the nasal bones, and on either side with the lateral cartilages. The inferior border is attached to the vomer and the median ridge at the junction of the palatine processes of the superior maxillae.

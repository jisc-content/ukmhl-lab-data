LUMBAR PLEXUS. 497 The cjmito-crural nerve is small, and comes from the second lumbar, and by a few filaments from the communicating branch of the first. After perforating the psoas, it lies for a short distance upon its anterior surface, and then runs down along the outer side of the external iliac artery. Near the crural arch it divides into the genital branch (r/), which runs down on the external iliac artery, and, piercing the fascia transversalis, descends through the internal abdominal ring, along the inguinal canal, on the posterior Fig. 115. a. nio-hypogastrio n. b.

796 SCLEROTIC COAT. Fig. 197. of an incli on the inner or nasal side of the axis of vision. The sheath of the optic nerve becomes continuous with the sclerotic, where it perforates this coat. The optic nerve at its entrance into the sclerotic is much constricted, and instead of passing through a single aperture in this coat, it enters it through a number of minute apertures, so that this membrane forms a porous lamina, called the lamina crihrosa. In the centre of the lamina cribrosa is an opening (jporus opticus), larger than the rest, which transmits the arteria centralis retinae. Around the optic nerve the sclerotic is pierced by the ciliary arteries, veins, and nerves, for the supply of the choroid and iris. About a quarter of an inch from the cornea the sclerotic receives the insertions of the recti muscles; here also it transmits the anterior ciliary arteries, which run forward along the tendons of these muscles, and form a vascular rms around the circumference of the cornea (fig. 197). The sclerotic is SinucTTjnE. T â€ž composed oi con- nective tissue arranged in bundles, which run, some longitudinally, some transversely, and are inter- mingled with fine elastic fibres. The longitudinal fibres are the most external and abundant. Under the microscope numerous connective-tissue corpuscles may be seen filling cell-spaces, similar to those in the cornea but not so abundant, and containing pigment-granules. The inner surface of the sclerotic is of a dark brownish colour, due to the presence of a thin layer of connective tissue, lamina fusca, in which are found pigment-cells. This surface of the sclerotic is grooved for the pas- sage of the ciliary nerves, which run forward in a sort of lymph- space ; and it is, moreover, connected by filamentous tissue with the subjacent choroid coat. The cornea is the brilliant translucent coat which forms about the anterior one-sixth of the globe. It INSERTION OP THE HECTI MUSCLES WITH ANTERIOn CILIARY AETEKIES. CORKEA.

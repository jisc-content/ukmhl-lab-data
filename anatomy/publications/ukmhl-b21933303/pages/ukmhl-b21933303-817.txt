793 DISSECTION OF TEE EYE. Since the eye in the hiiman subject cannot be obtained suffi- ciently fresh for anatomical purposes, the student should examine the eye of the sheep, bullock, or pig. The conjunctiva should be removed, together with the loose connective tissue which unites it to the sclerotic coat. ^ ^ The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane which covers the ocular surface of the eyelids and the anterior part of the globe. It presents different characters in the various situations over which it is reflected, and is described as the palpebral, the sclerotic, and the corneal j)ortions. The palpebral portion is thicker than the other portions, is very vascular, and is provided with fine papillae abundantly supplied with nerves.' As described p. 30, it is continuous with the mucous membrane of the lachrymal sac through the canaliculi, and lines the Meibomian glands and the ducts of the lachrymal gland. The columnar epithelium which lines the palpebral conjunctiva be- comes at the margins of the eyelids more stratified and continuous with the flattened cells of the skin of the eyelid. It forms at the inner canthus a reduplicated fold, the plica semilunaris, and is reflected from the eyelids to the globe, its angle of reflection being called the fornix conjunctivce, and the folds into which this is thrown are termed the superior and inferior palpebral folds. The sclerotic conjunctiva is loosely attached by submucous tissue to the sclerotic coat, so as not to impede the movements of the globe. It is thinner, and has no papillfe. It is transparent and nearly â– colourless, except when inflamed; it then becomes intensely vascu- lar, and of a bright scarlet colour. The arteries are derived from ' These papilla; were first described by Eble, Ueber den Bau tmd die Kranh- Jieilen der Biiuleliaut des Auges.

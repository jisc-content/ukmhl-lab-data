Close to the junction of the limbus with the basilar membrane are a series of regularly arranged apertures, look- ing upwards to the sulcus spiralis : these are ovoid apertures for the . exit of branches of the cochlear nerve. The basilar membrane forms, at the base of the cochlea, but a jsmall breadth of the septum, the broadest part being composed of Ibone; but it gradually increases in breadth towards the cupola, vwhere it constitutes nearly the entire septum. It consists of a Fig. 205. . lap DUGBAMMATIC SECTION OP A COIL OF THE COCHLEA. (From Quain.) s V. Scala vestibuli. D c. Ductus cocMearis. s T. Scala tympani. m n. Membrane of Reissner. 11 s.

It has been stated that in the bony cochlea there is a partial •septum di'viding the spiral tube into two incomplete scalee. In 1 the recent condition the basilar membrane completes the septum ■ dividing the upper tube into an upper canal—the scala vestibuli, ; and a lower, the scala tympani. The upper scala is subdivided by an oblique membrane, membrane of Reissner, into two canals—an

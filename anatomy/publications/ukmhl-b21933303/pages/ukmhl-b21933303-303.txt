Superiorly, it is continued beneath the splenius, and is continuous with the deep cervical fascia; inferiorly, it binds down the muscles contained in the vertebral groove, and is attached to the upper border of the serratus posticus inferioi", and the tendon of the latissimus dorsi; internally, it is attached to the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrse, and externally to the angles of the ribs. This aponeurosis consists of three layers, of which only the posterior layer can now be seen ; the other two being demonstrated in the dissection of the abdo- LUMBAB F^VSCIA. ERECTOR SP.

The posterior or superficial layer is attached to the crest of the ilium, to the spinous processes of all the lower dorsal, lumbar, and sacral vertebra); it forms a sheath for the erector spinee, and serves for the attachment of the latissimus dorsi, the serratus posticus inferior, and the internal oblique.

252 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MALE AND FEMALE LARYNX. ■of the thyroid cartilage, and communicates with the inferior laryn- geal, and another communication with the same nerve is found behind the larynx beneath the pharyngeal mucous membrane. Its external laryngeal branch supplies the crico-thyroid muscle. The inferior (or recurrent) laryngeal nerve enters the larynx be- neath the inferior constrictor, and ascends behind the joint between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. It supplies all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the crico-thyroid. If the recurrent nerve be divided, or in any way injured, the muscles moving the glottis become paralysed, but its sensibility remains unimpaired. When the nerve is compressed by a tumour—for instance, an aneurism of the arch of the aorta—the voice is changed to a whisper,' or even lost. DiFFEiiENCE Until the approach of puberty, there is no great BETWEEN THE Male difference in the relative size of the male and AND THE Fejiale female larynx. The larynx of the male, ■\^dthin Laeynx. years after this time, becomes nearly doubled in size; that of the female grows, but to a less extent. The larynx of the adult male is in all proportions about one third larger than that of the adult female. The alsD of the thyroid cartilage form a more acute angle in the male ; hence the greater projection of the pomum Adami and the .greater length of the vocal cords in the male.

MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 722 Oblongata is the portion below the pons, which is continuous below with the spinal cord and rests upon the lower part of the basilar process of the occipital bone. The result of a large number of observations shows that the weight of the brain averages in males 4,9^ oz., and in females about 44 oz.; although it has been known to weigh as much as 64 oz., as in the case of Cuvier's brain, and as little as 23 oz., in the case of an idiot's brain. The following are the weights of the various portions of the encephalon which have been carefully collated by Dr. J. Eeid.' Male Female oz. dr3. oz. drs.

The relative proportion of the amount of white to grey matter iSj 64 per cent, of white substance to 36 per cent, of grey matter. The weight of the encephalon varies greatly in different sub- jects, and although its weight seems to bear some proportionate relation to the intellectual power, yet in many instances there appears to be no such definite relation. ' The brain weight gradually increases up to the age of forty, when it attains its maximum; after this period the weight decreases at the rate of one ounce for every additional ten years of life. MEDULLA OBLONGATA. The medulla oblongata is that part of the cerebro-spinal axis which is placed below the pons Varolii, and is continuous with the spinal cord on a level with the upper border of the atlas. It is slightly pyramidal in shape, with the broad part above. It lies on the basilar groove of the occipital bone, and descends obUquely ' Eeid, London and Edinburgh Monthly Journal of Medical Science, April 1843.

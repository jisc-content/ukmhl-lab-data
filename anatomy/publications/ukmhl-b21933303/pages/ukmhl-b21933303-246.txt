222 STRUCTURE OF THE LUNGS. Fig. 51. extremities, called infandihula, of ramifications of tlie pulmonary- vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, and, lastly, of the bronchial vessels. The cells of the interlobular tissue have no communication with the air-vesicles, unless the latter be ruptured by excessive straining, and then this connective tissue becomes inflated with air and is called interlohular emphysema. When infiltrated with serum it constitutes oedema of the lung. Each bronchial tube divides and subdivides into smaller and smaller divergent tubes, until each has reached a reduced size of about 1 mm.; it then enters a pul- monary lobule, when it is termed a lobular hroncldal tnhe, and presents on its walls numerous dilatations, called air-cells or alreoli, which vary from to y'q- of an inch in diameter (fig. 51). Thus reduced in size, the walls of the tubes no longer present traces of cartilaginous tissue, but are com- posed of a delicate elastic membrane upon which the capillaries ramify in a very minute network.' Each tube finally terminates in an enlarged ir- regular passage — alveolar passage— from which proceed on all sides nume- rous blind dilatations, named infundi- hula. The smaller bronchial tubes are encircled by more or less complete rings of cartilage; but as the tubes lessen in calibre, the rings become less perfect; so that when the tubes are reduced to -^\th. of an inch in diameter the rings entirely disappear. The continuation of the air-tubes consists simply of fibrous tissue which becomes gradually thinner, so that in the smallest tubes they are reduced to simply membranous tubes, and are continued on as irregular passages—intercellular ' In phthisis the expectoration contains some of the debris of this elastic framework of the air-veeicles ; it can be seen under the microscope, and is a test of the character of the sputa. ultimate air-cells of the lunq (from kBlliker). magnified twenty-five times.

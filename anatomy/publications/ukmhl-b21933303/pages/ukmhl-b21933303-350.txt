This nerve, as it lies close to the axillary vein, communicates with the first or second intercosto-humeral nerve. The internal cutaneoits branch of the musculo-spiral nerve pierces the fascia, and supplies the skin of the inner and posterior aspect of the * middle of the arm as far as the olecranon. The cutaneous branches of the circumflex nerve pierce the fascia over

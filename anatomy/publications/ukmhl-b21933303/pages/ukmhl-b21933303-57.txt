PUNCTA LACHRYMALIA. 33 cliarmel. This cliannel is said to conduct the tears to the puncta lachrymalia. According to our observation, this channel does not exist; for when the lids are closed, their margins are in such accurate apposition, that not the slightest interspace can be dis- covered between them. Puncta The puncta lachrymalia are two pin-hole aper- Lachbymalu. tures, easily discovered on the margin of the lids, close to the inner angle. They are the orifices of the canals, called canaliculi, which pass inwards, and convey the tears into the lachry- mal sac. Observe that their orifices are directed backwards. The upper canaliculus, the longer and narrower of the two, ascends for a short distance nearly vertically, and then dilating into a small pouch makes a sharp bend inwards for about a quarter of an inch to join the lachrymal sac ; the lower canal descends perpendicularly, and, like the upper, makes a sharp bend, after which it pursues a direction upwards and inwards to the sac. The two canals open separately into the sac (sometimes by a common orifice). In facial palsy, the tensor tarsi being affected, the puncta lose their proper direc- tion, and the tears flow over the cheek. In the introduction of probes for the purpose of opening the con- tracted puncta, or of slitting up the lachrymal ducts, it is necessary to /" know the exact direction of these canals. (See diagram.) When from any cause the tears are secreted in greater quantity than usual, they overflow and trickle down the cheek. Meibomian These long compound sebaceous glands, so called Glands. after the anatomist â€¢ who first described them- are situated on the under surface of each of the tarsal cartilages. In the upper lid there are between twenty and thirty; not quite so many in the lower. On everting the lid, they are seen running in longitudinal parallel rows in grooves in the cartilage.

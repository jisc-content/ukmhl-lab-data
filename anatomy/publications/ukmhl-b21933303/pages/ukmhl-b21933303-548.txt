524 DISSECTION OF THE FEMALE PERINEUM. sidered straight. Its direction, however, is not horizontal. In the unitnpregnated state it runs nearly in the direction of the axis of the outlet of the -pelvis; so that a probe pushed on in the course of the urethra would strike against the promontory of the sacrum. But, after impregnation, when the uterus begins to rise out of the pelvis, the bladder is more or less raised also in con- sequence of their mutual connection; therefore the urethra, in the latter months of utero-gestation, acquires a much more perpendi- cular course. The female urethra is provided with a comiTressor muscle, similar, in origin and arrangement, to that which surrounds the membranous part of the urethra in the male. It also passes through the triangular ligament. The prostate gland is wanting. Fig. 124. 1. Meatus urinarlas. 2. Vagina. 3. Bulb of vagina. 4. ClitoiTS with its two crura. BULB OF THE VAGINA.' but there are minute glands scattered around the neck of the bladder. In consequence of the wider span of the pubic arch, and the more yielding nature of the surrounding structures, the female urethra is much more dilatable than the male. By means of a sponge-tent, it may be safely dilated to admit the easy j^assage of the fore-finger into the bladder. Advantage is taken of this great dilatability in the extraction of calculi from the bladder. The mucous coat of the urethra is pale and arranged in longi- tudinal folds, and is lined by squamous epithelium, which changes to the spheroidal variety near the bladder. Next to the mucous coat is a layer of elastic and non-striped muscular fibres inter- mixed. The muscular tissue is arranged in two layersâ€”an outer, consisting of circular fibres, and an inner of longitudinal fibres. ' Token from an injected preparation in the Mus^e Orfila, at Paris.

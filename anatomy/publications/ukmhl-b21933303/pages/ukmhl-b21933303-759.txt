735 FISSURES OF THE CEREBRUM. vertical, about an inch in length, and a posterior or horizontal ramus, which passes backwards and slightly upwards, and ends at the posterior third of the cerebrum by a bifid extremity. Within the fissure, near its commencement, a series of convolutions may be VIEW OF THE CONVOLCTIONS AND FISSUBES OF THE EXTEBNAL SUEFACE OF THE BEAIN (left side). A. Fissure of Eolando. B.

In the fork between the two rami of the Sylvian fissure are ol'everal convolutions, which have been termed by Broca the ojyer- fVuhim of the ins-ala.

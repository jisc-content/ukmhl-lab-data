541 BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. ;tlie bladder, the vesiculte seminales, and the prostate, anastomosing ^vith branches of the corresponding artery of the other side. c. The middle hcemorrhoidal artery which usually arises in con- junction with the preceding, and supplies the rectum, inosculating with the other htemorrhoidal arteries. d. The obturator artery which runs along the side of the pelvis, below the corresponding nerve, to the upper part of the obturator foramen, through which it passes to be distributed to the muscles of the thigh. In the pelvis it lies between the] peritoneum and the Fig. 1.30. B VIEW OF THE DUTEBENT DIRECTIONS WHICH AN ABNOElLiL OBTUBATOE ABTEEY MAY TAKE. (seen PEOM ABOVE.) . 1'G-imberuat's ligament. 2.

External to the jielvis it divides into an external and internal branch, which respectively skirt the outer ind inner margins of the obturator foramen. The obturator artery does not, in all subjects, take the coursa above stated, since, in one case in three and a half, it arises from the

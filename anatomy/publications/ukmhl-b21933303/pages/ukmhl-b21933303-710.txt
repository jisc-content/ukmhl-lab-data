Cut open the sheath which con- tains them ; follow them on to the toes, to see that each bifurcates over the first phalanx, to allow the long tendon to pass through; then the two slips, reuniting, are inserted into the sides of the second phalanx. The same arrangement prevails in the fingers. It is supplied by the internal plantar nerve. The three superficial muscles should now be reflected, by sawing off about half an inch of the os calcis, and then turning it downwards Fig. 158. 1 Abductor mi- nimi digiti. 2.

This done, we bring into view the plantar vessels and nerves, and the second layer of muscles—i.e. the long flexor tendon of the great toe, that of the other toes, and the flexor accessorius.

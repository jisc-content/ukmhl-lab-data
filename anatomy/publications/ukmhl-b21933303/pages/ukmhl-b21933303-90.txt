6G EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. ExTEiiNAL The external jugular' vein is formed witliin the Jugular Vhin. substance of the parotid gland by the junction of the temporal and internal maxillary veins. After receiving the transverse facial and posterior auricular veins, it appears at the lower border of the gland, crosses obliquely over the sterno-mastoid muscle (fig. 24), running along its posterior border, nearly as low down as the clavicle, where it pierces the deep cervical fascia and terminates in the subclavian vein.

DIAGBAM OF THE SUPERFICIAL NERVES AND VEINS OF THE NECK. upper part is the auricularis magnus nerve, and crossing it, about the middle, is the superficial cervical nerve, both being branches of the superficial cervical plexus. It is usually provided with two pairs of valvesâ€”the lower, imperfect, close to its termination in the, subclavian vein; the upper, placed about an inch and a half above the clavicle. A line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle would indicate its course. To trace the vein, during life, press upon it just above the clavicle; but do not be surprised if you fail to find it: it is sometimes wanting, and frequently very small.

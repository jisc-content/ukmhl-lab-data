INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. 248 cricoid cartilage, ascends obliquely outwards, and is inserted into tlie inferior border and lower cornu of tbe thyroid. Its action is to tighten the vocal cords. It does this by raising the anterior part of the cricoid cartilage: since this cartilage cannot be raised without lengthening these cords, as shown by the dotted line, "fig. 56. Its nerve is the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal. Between the anterior borders of the two muscles is seen the crico-thyroid membrane, which is divided in laryngotomy. M. Ckico- This muscle arises from the broad depression on the posterior part of the cricoid cartUage; its fibres converge, and pass outwards and upwards, Fig. .'jT. abytenoide0s Posticus.

It does this by drawing the posterior tubercle of the arytenoid cartilage totvards the mesial line, and therefore the anterior angle (to which the vocal cord is attached) from the mesial line (fig. 57). In this movement the arytenoid cartilage rotates as upon a pivot, and acts as a lever of the first order; the fulcrum or ideal pivot being interme- diate between the power and the weight. This muscle dilates the glottis at each inspiration. Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal.' ' A slip called the ' kerato-cricoid ' is occasionally present. It is a short

The filaments of the intercosto-humeral nerves (p. 313) descend along the inner and posterior part of the arm as far as the olecranon, and communicate with the internal cutaneous branch of the musculo-spiral nerve. The internal cutaneous nerve perforates the fascia, with the basilic vem about the middle of the arm, and divides into an anterior and a

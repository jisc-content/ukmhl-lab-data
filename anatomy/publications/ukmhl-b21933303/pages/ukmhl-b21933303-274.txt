INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX. 250 M. Thyko- This muscle a/i-ises from tlie side of the angle of ioiYTENoiDEus. ^ho thypold cartilage and the crico-thyroid mem- brane, runs horizontally backwards, and is inserted into the base and anterior surface of tlie arytenoid. Its fibres run parallel with GLOTTIS CLOSED : MUSCLES CLOSING IT EEPBESENTED WAVT. the true vocal cord, and some of them are directly inserted into it. It consists of two fasciculi—an upper and a lower. The lower and larger portion is inserted into the anterior angle and the anterior surface of the arytenoid ; the ■zippe?' is inserted into the upper part of the anterior surface and the anterior border of the arytenoid. Its nerve comes from the inferior laryngeal. This muscle relaxes the vocal cord. More than this, it puts the lip of the glottis in the vocalising position ; in this position the margins of the glottis are parallel, and the chink is reduced to the breadth of a shilling. The following table shows the action of the several muscles which act upon the glottis :— Crico-thyroidei . . . Stretch the vocal cords. Thyro-arytenoidei . . Relax the vocal cords, and place them in the vocalising position. Crico-arytenoidei postici . Dilate the glottis.

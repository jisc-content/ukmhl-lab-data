775 THE CEREBELLUM. The cerebellum consists of two lateral hemisjy/ieres united by an intermediate portion, tlie vermiform 'p'^'ocess, the upper aspect of which takes the name of the superior vermiform process, the inferior that of the inferior vermiform process. Comparative anatomy proves that this is the fundamental part of the cere- bellum, the lateral masses not being developed in the vertebrate series until after the birds. In man the lateral masses form by far the largest part of the cerebellum. The two hemispheres on their under aspect are convex and separated from each other by a deep fossa, the vallecula; and, Pig. 191.

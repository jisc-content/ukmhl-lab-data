715 DISSECTION OF TEE BBAIN. Before passing on to the examination of the brain, tlie student Membranes should study the arrangement, the structure, and OF THE Brain. the uses of the three membranes by which the brain is enveloped. The most external one, the dura mater, has been described (p. 8). The second, or intermediate one, is a serous membrane, termed the arachnoid; the third, the pia mater, is a vascular layer, and is in contact with the encephalon. Arachnoid The araclmoid membrane,^ the second invest- Membrane. ment, constitutes the smooth polished membrane I covering the surface of the brain, and is exposed after the removal • of the dura mater. This tunic was formerly considered by anato- 1 mists to be an example of an ordinary serous membrane, and was 1 described as consisting of two layers—an external or parietal, ^ which lined the inner surface of the dura mater, and an internal or \ visceral, which was reflected over the brain. It is now regarded as consisting of one layer only—viz., the c one which envelopes the brain ; the under aspect of the dura mater I being covered only with a layer of flattened epithelium cells. The cavity which was formerly described as the cavity of the arach- noid, is now called the subdural space, and contains a very limited ount of fluid. The arachnoid membrane is a colourless and transparent layer, •nd is spread uniformly over the surface of the brain, from which 't is separated by the pia mater. It does not, like the pia mater, *p down into the furrows between the convolutions of the brain, nd it is more or less connected with the pia mater by delicate onnective tissue, the subarachnoid.

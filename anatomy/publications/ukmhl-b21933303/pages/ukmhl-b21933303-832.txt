STEUCTURE OF THE RETINA. 808 those found in the nerve-fibre and ganglionic layers, are also found in this stratum, chiefly on its surfaces. 4. The inner nuclear layer (fig. 200, 4) contains three kinds of cells, and some fibres which belong to the Miillerian or connective tissue fibres of the retina. The first kind consists of oval bipolar cells Fig. 200. 8. Layer of pigment cells. 7. Layer of rods and cones, (llembrana Jacobi.) liembrana limitans ext. 6. Outer nuclear layer. 6. Cater molecular layer. 4. Inner nuclear-layer. 3. Inner molecular-layer. 2. Layer of nerre-cells. 1. Layer of nerve-fibres. Membrana limitans interna. DIAGBAM OF THE VABIOUS LAYEES OF THE BETINA. (AFTER SCHWALBE.) placed longitudinally, and having a distinct nucleus and nucleolus; from the inner extremities of these cells there extend long vari- cose, thin processes which pass vertically downwards, without division, into the inner molecular layer, and are presumably con- nected with the processes of the ganglionic layer and thence with

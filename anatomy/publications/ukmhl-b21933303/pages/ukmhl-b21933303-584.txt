560 THE PENIS. the two corpora cavernosa; it is only complete near the root of the penis; along the rest of the organ there are vertical slits in it, giving it the appearance of a comb: hence its name. Through the intervals in this partition the blood-vessels of the two corpora cavernosa communicate freely with each other. The fibrous investment is thick and strong, and consists o longitudinal bundles of white fibrous tissue, intermingled with yeUow elastic fibres. From the interior of the fibrous coat numerous delicate septa, trabeculce, pass into the interior of the corpus cavernosum, intersecting each other in aU directions, divid- ing it up into a multitude of small spaces. This trabecular tissue consists of fibrous lamellee, with elastic and some non-striated Fig. 134. 1. Corpus oaveruosum. 2. Corpus spongiosum urothrre. 3. Dorsal veiu. 4, 4, Dorsal ai'teries, C, 5.

The spaces, lined by a layer of flattened epithe- lium cells, similar to that of veins, communicate freely with each other, as may be readily ascertained by blowing air into the penis; they are smaller, and their component septa thicker at the circum- ference than in the centre of the corpora cavernosa, at the root than towards the glans. Each corpus cavernosum thus consists of innimierable spaces mainly occupied by dilated venous sinuses, from which the blood is conveyed by the dorsal vein, the jDrostatic plexus, and the pudendal veins. When the penis is flaccid, these spaces are empty; when it is erect, they are distended with blood. The arteries of the corpora cavernosa come from the branches of the pudic (p. 519), which enter the inner side of each crus, at its bulbous enlargement, and proceed forwards near the septum, distributing numerous ramifications. These are supported in the

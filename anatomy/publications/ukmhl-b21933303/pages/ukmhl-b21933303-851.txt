COCHLEA. 827 L diameter of its base, and also of its height, is about the same, •namely, a quarter of an inch. It consists of a gradually tapering - spiral tube, which winds round a central pillar, called the modiolus or columella. The spiral canal is divided into two parallel tubes, ■scalce, by a delicate lamina, partly bony, partly membranous, which is called the lamina spiralis. In the dry condition this parti- •tion is only partial; but in the recent state it is completed by a ! membrane. The spiral canal (fig. 203, 9, lo) is about an inch and a half 'long, and about the -j^gth of an inch in diameter, lessening as it approaches the summit. After making two turns and a half, it ! terminates at the apex of the cochlea in a rounded dome—the cupola. The coil at the base is the widest, the second being a Fig. 204. 1. Soala tympani. 2. Scala vestibuli. THE OSSEOUS COCHLEA. (MAGNIFrED FIVE TIMES.) very small one. The canal has in it three openings; thus it communicates with the vestibule by an oval opening; with the ■ tympanum by the fenestra rotunda, but which in the recent state is closed by the memhrana secundaria; and, lastly, there is the aperture of the aqiiceductus cochlece, which transmits a small vein from the cochlea to the internal jugular vein. The modiolus or columella (fig. 204, 4) is the central pillar of the cochlea around which the spiral canal coils, and it passes from the base to the apex. It is of considerable thickness at its base, but gradually tapers towards the apex, where at the last half coil it terminates in a half funnel-shaped curved lamella, called the infundihxdum. Here the partition disappears, and is called the helicotrema, so that the scalte vestibuli and cochleas communicate with each other in this situation. The interior of the modiolus is

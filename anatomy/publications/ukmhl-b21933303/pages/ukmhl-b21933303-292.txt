FACIAL NERVE IN THE TEMPORAL RONE. ■268 nerves are connected by one or more filaments. The facial nerve then enters the aquaeductus Pallopii. This is a tortuous canal in the substance of the temporal bone, and terminates at the stylo- mastoid foramen. The nerve proceeds from the meatus audi- torius internus for a short distance outwards towards the hiatus Fallopii, where it presents a ganglionic enlargement—the intume- ■scentia (jangliformis, or geniculate ganglion—where it is joined by •several nerves ; it then makes a sudden bend backwards along the inner wall of the tympanum above the fenestra ovalis, and lastly, Fig. 04. 1. The chorda tympani. 2. The geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. 3. The great petrosal nerve. ■4. Tho lesser petrosal nerve lying over the tensor tynipani. THE G15NICULATR OANGLIOK OF THE FACIAL NEEVE, AND ITS CONNECTIONS WITH THE OTHER NERVES. (From Bidder.) curving downwards along the back of the tympanum, it leaves the skull through the stylo-mastoid foramen. Its branches of communication in the temporal bone are : — Those in the meatus auditorius internus— ft. With the auditory nerve. Those in the aquaeductus Fallopii— b. With Meckel's ganglion through the large petrosal nerve. c. With the otic ganglion through the smaU superficial petrosal nerve. d. With the sympathetic around the middle meningeal artery through the external superficial petrosal nerve. 6. The external petrosal nerve communicating with the sjTnpathetio ple-xus on the orteria meniugea media (6). 7. The Gasserian ganglion.

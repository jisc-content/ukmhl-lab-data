498 LUMBAR PLEXUS. The external cutaneous nerve of the thir/h (c) is generally de- rived from tlie loop between the second and third lumbar nerves. It runs through the psoas, then, crossing obliquely over the iliacus towards the anterior superior spine of the ilium, passes beneath the crural arch, and is finally distributed to the skin on the out- side of the thigh. If the external cutaneous be not found in its usual situation, look for it as a distinct branch of the anterior crural, nearer the psoas muscle. The anterior crural (d), the largest and most important branch, is formed by the union of the third and fourth lumbar nerves, receiving a small branch from the second. It descends in a groove between the psoas and the iliacus behind the fascia iliaca, supplies both these muscles and a branch to the femoral artery, and then, passing under the crural arch to the outer side of the femoral artery, is finally distributed to the extensor muscles of the knee, to the sartorius and pectineus, and the skin of the thigh and leg. The obturator nerve (/), next in size to the anterior crural, proceeds from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, and some- times from the second. It descends through the psoas muscle, and then, getting to its inner border, runs along the brim of the pelvis above its cori'esponding vessels to the obturator foramen, through the upper part of which it passes to the adductor muscles of the thigh. The accessory ohturator nerve, by no means a constant branch, is derived from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, and sometimes from the obturator nerve. It runs down along the inner border of the psoas, passes in front of the horizontal ramus of the os pubis, supplies the pectineus, and gives ofi" a small branch to the hip- joint, and another to communicate with the anterior branch of the obturator nerve.

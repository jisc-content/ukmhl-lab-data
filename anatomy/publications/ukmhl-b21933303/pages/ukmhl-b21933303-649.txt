Lawrence, or upwards through Hey's ligament, as recommended by Sir A. Cooper.' There is no risk of wounding an artery, supposing the vessels to take their ordinary CJOurse. But it occasionally happens (fig. 148), that the obturator artery runs above (in the recumbent position) the femoral ring ; in such a case, the neck of the sac would be encircled by a large ' The operation recommended by Sir A. Cooper is that usually performed now ; because, if Gimbernat's ligament be divided, its cut edges often retract to such an extent, that no truss can possibly retain the hernia when the patient assumes the erect posture.

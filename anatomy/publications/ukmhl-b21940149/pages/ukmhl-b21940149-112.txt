78 OF CHRONIC HERNIA. the size o( tlie tumour; for, even in small crural hernia, I have seen the hernial sac of a very considerable thickness, and of a cartilaginous consistence. I have also remarked, that, though that part of the .sac which is external to the parietes ol’ the abdomen have attained an un- natural thickness, yet the neck of the sac was not thicker than the healthy peritoneum. On the other hand, the neck of the hernial sac, in consequence of inflammation, sometimes becomes much thicker than its bo- dy, and frequently proves the cause of stricture in hernia of considerable duration, and especially when the patient has worn a truss. In a few cases, the unnatural thickness is limited to the neck of the sac, and occasions the strangulation of the intestine, but I believe, generally, that, in recent hernia, the strangulation has been occasioned by those parts which are external to the sac. The condensation of the cellular substance around the sac, adds considerably to its thickness; it is generally thicker at its neck than elsewhere : and sometimes the cellular substance con- sists of distinct layers, so that if becomes difficult for the sur- geon to determine when he has reached the peritoneum. Tumours growing from the inner side of the sac also add to its thickness. In two cases of hernia, I have observed small tumours grow- ing from the inside of the sac, bv which it attained an unnatu- ral thickness. But in large hernia, the sac frequently becomes thinner than even the healthy peritoneum, and the colour of the protruded intestine may be remarked within it; and sometimes also so tender as to be ruptured by the effort of coughing *. The thinness of the sac has been remarked, especially in the umbilical hernia. The hernial sac has been sup}X)sed to be destroyetl, in conse- quence of the rapid increase of the bulk of the hernia ; but such • Vide Mkhsknne, .loumal de IMed. tom. xxii. 1

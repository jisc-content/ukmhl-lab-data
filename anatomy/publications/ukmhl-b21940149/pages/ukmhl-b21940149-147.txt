OF THE PARTS CONCERNED IN HERNIA. 113 \^th, That, as the inguinal apertures are extended in conse- quence of the bowels passing repeatedly through these, the Up- per [nguhial Aperture may be so much enlarged, as to be brought immediately opposite to the Under Abdominal Aper- ture ; and, in such a case, no part of the hernial tumour has an oblique direction, lor it passes directly through the parictes of the abdomen. V6ih, That, as there is fat around the Under Abdominal, and also at the Crural Aperture, if there be an unusual quan- tity of it in such a situation, it may lK*ar a strong resem- blance to a hernia; and should colic, constipation and vomit- ing follow, the case may erroneously be sujrposcd to be a stran- gulated hernia. That, on account of the connection of the crural arch with the neighbouring fa.scire, when we wish to relax as far as possible the superficial fascia, and the inguinal canal, to take off the prcssui*e and stricture ujKm the displaced intestine, it is necessary to raise the head and pelvis of the patient (who is supposed to be in bed) with pillows, to bend the thighs very considerably, ami to throw the knee of the afi’ecteil side over to the op|X)site side, leaving only sullicient space for the surgeon to introduce his hand. On attempting to reduce such hernia', the pressure should be made in the same direction as the hernial tu- mour; that is, in a recent inguinal hernia, the pressure should be made in the direction of the anterior spinous process of the os ilium ; and in a hernia of some duration, directly upwards, as the Upper and Under Parts of the Inguinal Canal are, in such a case, nearly opposite to each other. \5th, That unless the truss shall make pressure, not only upon the Under, but also upon the Upper Abdominal Aper- ture, the inguinal hernia will not be removed ; and that a truss which presses only upon the Under Aperture, instead of afford- ing relief, exposes the patient to strangulation at the Upper Ab- dominal Aperture, or between the Upper and Under Abdominal Apertures *. • Injustice to my Father, I cannot forbear describing a Truss for an Inguinal Hernia, which he directed to be made many years ago, and which several of his patients have worn with much benefit.

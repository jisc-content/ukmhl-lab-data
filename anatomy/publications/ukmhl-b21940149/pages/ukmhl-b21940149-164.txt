130 OF THE COMMON INGUINAL HERNIA. Of the most Common kind of Inguinal Hernia. This hernia may be reducible, irreducible, or strangulated. When the protruded bowels are not properly supported, they soon pass into the scrotum, the loose texture of which does not oppose the expansion of the tumour. It sometimes therefore acquires an enormous bulk, descending as low as the knee, and contains the greater share of the more moveable bowels of the abdomen. The protruded parts cannot be returned, on account of their increased bulk, or from their adhesion to the hernial sac, or from membranous bands passing across the sac. These hernias, besides their mere bulk and weight, prove the source of much inconvenience and uneasiness; the penis is sunk, within the tumour, and the urethra being displaced, the urine is discharged with difficulty, and is apt, by distilling along the skin, to fret and inflame it to a great degree. The displaced bowels have sometimes been ruptured in con- sequence of external violence *. A sinus forms in the scrotum of some persons afflicted by hernia, which it is impossible to heal without confining the patient to bed. In proportion as the hernial tumour becomes larger, the func- tions of the displaced bowels are more impaired, not only from their being unsupported, and not exposed to the pressure of the abdominal muscles, but also from their being twisted, and com- pacted together by unnatural adhesions. There has been, in some constitutions, so great a relaxation, that even those bowels which are fixed down firmly at a distance from the groin by the peritoneum, as the spleen and liver have passed into the hernial sac. The uterus has sometimes been protruded at the groin : cases of that description are mentioned by Hildanus, Ruysch, and Lallemknt. Strangulation rarely occurs when the hernial tumour is of a very large size. Vide CoopEH, p. 17-, 1st edit

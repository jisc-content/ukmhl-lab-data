122 FORMATION OF THE INGUINAL CANAL. the posterior side is wanting, which is not a very rare maUbr- mation, then our only difficulty must depend on the action of the lower outlet. In this case, the cross fibres which bind the two pillars together, act on the sac; and the fillet, from the upper pillar, embraces it closely, but not equally, in every direc- tion of the limb, When the toes are rolled inward, and the thigh, on the affected side, pulled from the other, and turned backward, this fillet is sunk into the sac, and retains it im- moveably in its situation. “ This species of stricture may most readily be overcome, by moving the member in an opposite way ; and, I believe, in knowing bow to humour the parts in the taxis, the great superiority of one surgeon over another consists. When, how- ever, the rupture has taken place in infancy, and continued till the complete extension of the canal is accomplished, then, besides this source of difficulty, there is also a source of em- barrassment, arising from the reaction of the fibres of the trans- versalis and internal oblique muscles upon the sac, which oc- casions a species of stricture, in which bloodletting, warmth, and the relaxing the muscles, by bending the body sideways, facilitate the reduction. The above remark applies to that species of incarceration dependent on a narrowing of the in- ternal orifice of the canal,” , A part of the muscles of the abdomen is sometimes awanting at the navel, of which I have seen several instances in children. It also sometimes happens, that there is a defect of the smaller tendinous columns which form the inguinal canal, so that when the lx)wels are protruded at the under alxlominal aperture, the hernia is situated at the common place of a crural hernia. Of the situation of the neighbouring Bloodvessels in respect U> Inguinal and ^Crural Hernia. The e))igastric artery generally arises from the anterior iliac artery, and passes behind the spermatic cord, on the side of the upper ;ib<lominal aperture, next the pubes, in its course to the po.sterior part of the rectus muscle; the epigastric artery must

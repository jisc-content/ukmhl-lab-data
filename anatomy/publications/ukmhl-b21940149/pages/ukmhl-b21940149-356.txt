308 RUPTURE OP" THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. There were two separate bands of coagulable lymph, which, extending across the ruptured end of the jejunum, divided its orifice into three distinct though unequal parts. The whole of the intestines was of a leaden colour, and bore evident marks of peritoneal inflammation, the convolutions of the ileum being very firmly united to each other by short and numerous adhesions. The sigmoid flexure of the colon and the rectum were consi- derably contracted, and their coats felt thicker and more fleshy than usual; whereas the great arch of the colon was much dis- tended by air, and had attained a preternatural size. Upon opening the intestines, it was ascertained that the in- flammation had not been confined to the peritoneal coat, for, in several places, there were spots, of the size of a shilling, of a dark red colour, on the villous coat, which colour was owing to the small branches of bloodvessels distributed upon that coat being gorged with blood. The preceding case affords a striking example of inflamma- tion of the intestines, followed by suppuration and rupture of the intestine. In consequence of the ruptured jejunum being surrounded by a sheath of coagulable lymph, life was not extinguished so soon as the rupture took place. Serous cysts are sometimes imbedded in the muscular sub- stance. The solitary hydatid (Cysticercus cellulosa) has been found in muscles, of which Bremsek *, Werner, and Rudolphi have made particular mention. Lastly, Bone has been ofteii found in the substance of muscle. I have frequently seen it in the substance of the heart, but I have never met with bony substance in the muscular coat of any part of the alimentary canal. * Trait6 Zoologique, xi. p. 280.

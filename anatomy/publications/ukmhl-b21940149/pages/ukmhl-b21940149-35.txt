MORBID ANATOMY. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS, AND MORBID ANATOMY OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAI.. I KOM the nature, variety, and importance, of the functions of the Aiamkntary Canal, and from the number and complexity of the organs that contribute to digestion, any disorder of a function of such primary necessity, and on which all the others so immediately depend, will necessarily derange the system to a greater or less extent; hence an investigation of the organic diseases incident to this part of our frame, constitutes one of the most extensive, and, at the same time, one of the most important branches of pathology. Before procccâ€œding to the more immediate object of our in- (|uiry, and in order to explain more clearly the various bearings of this interesting subject, it may not be unprofitable to pre- mise a few general observations u(X)n the structure and func- tions of the Alimentary Canal. The tube through which the food passes, which repairs the waste, and sustains the strength, of the body, is, in the lower classes of animals, of a very simple structure, consisting solely, or chiefly, of a bag which contains the food, and of an aperture through which it is received and discharged. But in the higher classes of animals, it is more complex in its construction, being of considerable length, and enlarged in one or more places, so as to constitute a Stomach, or Stomachs. In such animals, the term Gullet is applied to the canal which leads into, and the term Intestine, to that which passes out of, the stomach, and A

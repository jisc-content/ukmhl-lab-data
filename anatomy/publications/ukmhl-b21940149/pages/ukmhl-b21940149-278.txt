230 ORGANIC derangements PROPER TO CLASS IV. ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS PROPER TO THE COATS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. The coats of the alimentary canal are different as to struc- ture, and therefore liable to different organic derangements. Organic derangements occasionally are propagated from their original seat to the other coats; and it is of much moment, in various points of view, to endeavour to trace their origin and influence during their progress upon the neighbouring tissues and general system. Pathologists have not yet investigated the organic disorders proper to the coats of the alimentary canal, in all their details and relations; nor have they marked with sufficient precision the distinctions between those organic derangements which are common to all the coats of the alimentary canal, and those which are originally proper to each, and in which all are some- times, in the progress of the disease, involved. To detect the origin, and to trace the progress and manner in which organic diseases are propagated, is a very difficult, though very important, task, and requires much patient re- search, and also experience of many cases of the same descrip- tion. On many occasions, morbid anatomy supplies only the means of examining diseased structure in its advanced stages; and hence the difficulty of tracing the progress of disease from the examination of a few cases. Those authors who have had but a limited s})herc of observa- tion, have rather retarded than accelerated the progress of mor- bid anatomy, by publishing imperfect dc.scriptions of the effects of organic disease; and, by giving a partial view, have in many

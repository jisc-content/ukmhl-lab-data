The quantity of blood which is discharged from an ulcerated surface, is occasionally so considerable as to cause death in a I' short time, as sometimes happens from cancerous ulceration of the stomach. In a precetling chapter, it has been observed, t that blood is effused, in considerable quantity, into the cavity of the abdomen, when the stomach or intestines have been rup- tured in consequence of external violenec..

58 or CALCULI OF THE TONSILS. the calculus, but no central nucleus. By the aid of a magnify- ing glass, the calculi seemed to be composed of small grains ag- glutinated to each other. I have subjoined a more particular account of the calculi, drawn out according to the manner of Weiiner, by Professor Â» Jameson, and the chemical analysis of one of these calculi by Dr Thomas Thomson. Colour of the surface dirty olive-green, internally greenish- grey towards the surface, but yellowish-grey in the centre. Shape, pyriform. Surface, granulated, inclining to botryoidal. Lustre, dull. Fracture, even. Concretions, curved lamellar concretions. Transparency, opaque. Hardness, yields to the nail. Tenacity, sectile inclining to brittle. Specific gravity 1.715. Constituents. 1; 'a white matter' retaining the size of the calculus, and swimming in water. It possesses the properties of coagulable albumen. 2. Phosphate of lime. 3. Carbonate of lime. It differs in its composition from any salivary calculus hither- to examined. But pulmonary calculi of a similar kind are com- mon.

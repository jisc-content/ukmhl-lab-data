127 IN RESPECT TO HERNIA. the size represented in Plate II. fig. 2., and, in such a case, if divided, would pour out a good deal of blood. If wounds of the epigastric artery have proved fatal, the same may result from the division of this artery. The peculiar course of the veins also merits attention. A plexus of veins is sometimes placed on Gimbernat’s ligament; a good deal of blood may be lost by wounding these, csjiecially as they run on the inner side of the crural arch, and there- fore the bleeding could not be stopped by pressure. The obturator vein generally accompanies the obturator ar- ' tery, and therefore may be divided at the same time as the ar- tery, in performing the operation for crural hernia, as recom- mended by Gimueknat. The late Mr A. Purns of Glasgow shewed me a case of crural hernia, in which a larre vkis passed along the inner part of the crural arch, and received the epigastric vein. In this case, if the division of the crural arch had been made directly upwards, supposing the patient to be in an erect jxjsition (as has l)cen re- commended), that large vein must have l)ccn divided, and, on account of the size of the vein, a great (piantity of blood must have been lost. OP' fNGUINAl, HERNIA. In this kind of hernia, the bowels are lotlgctl in some part of the inguinal canal. iSIan, from bis erect posture, is more exposed to inguinal and crural hernia, and quadrupeds to ven- tral hernia. The frequency of this kind of hernia is proportioned to the size of the canal; males, therefore, are more frequently afflicted by this heiaiia than females, as the subjoined statement proves.

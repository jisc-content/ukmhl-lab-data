i58 OF SCIllllIIUS AND CANCER and in the vicinity of the pylorus there is an oval opening, and also another opening at the cardiac extremity of the stomach, which has thin smooth edges. In this disease the mucous membrane of the stomach is more vascular than usual, and upon it there arc often small extrava- sations of blood.

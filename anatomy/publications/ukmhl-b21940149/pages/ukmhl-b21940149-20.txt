On the same principle, the surgeon acquainted witli the under abdominal aperture only in its healthy state, must be greatly embarrassed while performing tlic ope- ration of Inguinal Hernia ; for in such a case, that aper- ture retains neither its former size nor situation ; and when to these sources of embarrassment arc superadded the great changes produced upon the displaced bowels, and their coverings, his ])erplexity must be proportion- ally increased.

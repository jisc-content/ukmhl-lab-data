OF STRICTUKE OF THE RECTUM. 371 tained in the bowels for a long time previous to the opera- tion. The artificial opening has not shewn lately any disposition to contract. It had, when the history of it was published, been established between five and six months. “ The object of the operation has been completely attained. The patient’s general health is apparently good, and she has had no return of the dy- senteric symptoms before mentioned. Her pulse is commonly about 70 ; her tongue clean, her complexion florid ; her diges- tion is good, and so well disposed to make the most of her food, that her plan of diet is still directetl to be one of rather strict abstinence. She has recovered her flesh in a great degree. She is able to sit up, or walk about the house ; the latter, however, is an experiment which she has not ventured often. She has generally one or two stools a day ; and she does not, upon the whole, experience so much inconvenience from the manner of tlie evacuation as might have been expected. The bowel, when she is upright, has a great disposition to project: this would not have been the case if the skin covering it had not unluckily sloughed. The projc>ction of the bowel does not amount to a considerable prolapsus: it is merely a distention of the portion which is exposed. It is expectctl that this disposition to pro- lapsus will be restrained when use has made her contrivances a little more perfect. She has a truss, somewhat similar to that for exomphalos, constructed with a circular spring, and a large pad containing a weak spiral spring, which is preserved in its place by means of stra{>s : this contrivance has not, however, yet answered so well as a compress, confined by a band, pinned tightly around her.” From w'hat has been stated, it appears to me that this opera- tion, in certain cases, merits repetition.

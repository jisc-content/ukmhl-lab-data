OF SCIRllHUS AND CANCER 468 lower part of the colon and the rectum, into which, however, the chief part of the contents of the stomach was directly sent. â€œ This case, besides adding another to the numerous ex- amples already collected of apparent aneurism arising from other causes than disease of the arteries, also shows how extremely the stomach may be disorganized without vomiting being occa- sioned, and it leaves it doubtful whether the vomiting, which usually accompanies scirrhous pylorus, be not produced by the mere obstruction to the transmission of the food from the sto- mach into the bowels. Scirrhus and cancer of the body and the stomach are not accompanied with the same urgent symptoms that characterize scirrhous pylorus; and there are instances recorded in which the stomach has been found, on dissection, scirrhus, where there had been no previous vomiting, or any reason to suspect that such a disease existed. Scirrhous pylorus is occasionally obscure in its origin, insidi- ous in its progress, is very similar to dyspepsia, and generally does not occasion any well-marked symptoms until it has made considerable progress, and in some instances even until in its advanced stages. Vomiting two or three hours after meals, which is one of the more striking features of the disease, does not invariably occur; and there are occasionally intervals of good health. Many observations as to the deviations from the usual train of symptoms, are to be found in the valuable treatise of Dr Abebckombie on the Pathology of the Stomach and Intestines, to whose work the reader is referred. Vide pp. 63, 64, &c. OF SCIRRHUS AND CANCER OF THE INTESTINES. The larger intestines, and especially the head of the colon and upper part of the rectum, arc more frequently scirrhous than the smaller.

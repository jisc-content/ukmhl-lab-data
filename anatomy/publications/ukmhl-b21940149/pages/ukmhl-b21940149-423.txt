ULCERATION OF THE STOMACH. 375 The imuxHis membrane is found to be softer tlian usual, studded over to a greater or less extent with red or slate-co- loured patches, which are sensibly elevated above the surface of the mucous membrane, and have a fungous appearance. Tile veins which pass through the subjacent cellular- sub- stance are generally enlarged. A quantity of fluid, like the white of an egg, is usually found within the stomach, or, on some occasions, the fluid is of a brown colour, and not unlike to coffee grounds.

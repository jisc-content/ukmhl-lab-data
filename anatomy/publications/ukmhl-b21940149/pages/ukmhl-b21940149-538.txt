( 482 ) CHAPTER HI. OF THE ORGANIC DERANGEMENTS OF THE CEL- LULAR COAT OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. SECTION I. OF INFLAMMATION AND ABSCESSES IN THE CELLU- LAR SUBSTANCE OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. The coats of the alimentary canal are united by two cellular strata; the one is situated between the mucous and muscular, the other between the muscular and peritoneal coats: the former or submucous is much more abundant than the latter or subserous, and both these layers are connected by fine cellular threads and bloodvessels, which pass through the interstices of the muscular fibres. Inflammation begins in the cellular membrane, or it is sometimes translated from the mucous coat, its original seat, to the cellular substance, which, becoming condensed and thick- ened, diminishes the caliber of the portions of bowel affected. This condensed state of the cellular substance, in cases of gas- tritis and of enteritis, is often combined with an effusion of lymph, or with the formation of pus. When inflammation of cellular substance is circumscribed, the disease has been called phlegmon. The pus which the tumour contains is secreted in consequence of the vessels of the part taking on (as my Grandfather calls it) the action of a gland; at the same time, from the neighbour- ing arteries, serum, lymj)h, and blood, are effused, according to

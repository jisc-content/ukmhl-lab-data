401 OF THE ALIMENTAKY CANAL. Mr Tuavebs, in the 8th volume of the Mcdico-Chirurgh^al Transactions of London, has published cases of this description ; and, according to him,' the chief diagnostic symptoms are, “ Sudden, most acute, peculiar, and unremitting pain, ra^ dialing from the pit of the stomach, or navel, to the circum- ference of the trunk, and even to the limbs.” “ 2d, Simultaneous rigidity of the abdomen.” “ 3d, A natural pulse for some hours, till the symptoms of peritonitis begin.” In a case lately very ably described by my late pupil Dr Elliotson, (Med. Chir. Trans, of London, Part I. vol. xiii), the patient suffered dreadful agony from the first, at the pit of the stomach, and during the progress of the disease. “ The pain did not remit until after the fifth dose of opium. “ The rigidity of the abdomen did not strike me. The pulse was 120 from the first.” It not unfrequently happens, that a portion of all the coats of the stomach and intestines is destroyed by ulceration, but the peritoneal coat to a much smaller extent than the others. Several specimens of perforation of the stomach are in the ! Museum of the University of Edinburgh. A specimen is pre- served in which there was an opening in its under surface of three inches in circumference, leading to a cavity bounded by li adhesions between the stomach and pancreas, and a second open- u ing from it into the cavity of the abdomen. When a portion of the coats of the stomach has been destroyed by ulceration, the stomach, in some instances, communicates ^ with an abscess of the liver. I am indebted to Mr Watson for : a very important case of this description, which is subjoined, 1 with his remarks on it: “ Case Ulceration of the Stomach from an Adhesion to an Abscess of tlie Liver. “ Aug. 1824.—Mrs W., set. 47., had laboured under symp- toms of dyspepsia for several months.

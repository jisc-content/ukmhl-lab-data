OF THE INTESTINES. 4<69 The appearances on dissection are very similar to those which are observed in the same disease affecting the stomach. The parietes of the intestine are harder, thicker, and some- times nearly an inch in thickness, by which the caliber of the diseased portion is much diminished ; and the passage of the food being, to a certain degree, impeded, the intestine above the stric- ture becomes more or less expanded into a kind of pouch or pouches, the coats of which are thinner at certain places than the rest of the dilated intestines. Ulceration of the coats of the intestines follows, from the continuance of which, the contents of the diseased bowel escape into the cavity of the abdomen, or, where there has been previous adhesion, morbid communications are formed, as between the arch of the colon and stomach ; between the different turns of the intestines; between the rectum and bladder, or between the rectum, vagina and bladder, so that the fseces and urine are discharged by a common orifice. The perforated part of the intestine is sometimes filled with a malig- nant fungus. In some instances, cancerous tumours grow from the peritoneal surface of the intestines, and at length form one common ulcer with those that are internal. There are two preparations in the Museum, which exhibit a variety of cancer of the intestines, which I believe is very rare, and has not been described. About a foot of the inter- nal surface of the ileum is studded over with distinct tumours, of a dark-brown colour, inclining to purple, which are about half an inch thick, and which seem to be very soft; every part of the surface of these tumours is perforated by small holes, which are disposed at equal distances from each other, and are of a uniform size.

The disease generally comes on in a slow, and almost im- perceptible manner, and makes for some time but little pro- gress.

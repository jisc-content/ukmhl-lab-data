456 OF SCIllKHUS AND CANCER â€¢ Firfc Plate V. felt it stop; sometimes it remained in that situation only for a few minutes, at other times it stuck there for many hours ; the greater part of it was then returned by an inverted action of the eesophagus, and sometimes even the small quantity of food which reached the stomach was rejected by vomiting, almost un- changed. When she lay on her back, or in any other posture, except half-inclined to the right side, she experienced the same sensa- tions in her bowels as a person does in a limb, when it is said to be asleep; which sensations left her when she assumed any other position; she complained of pain and distention of sto- mach. Her body was much bound, she having had only one evacuation in eight days. In that miserable state she lived for four or five months, and at last was unable to force any thing beyond the pharynx. She became, a few days before her death, so weak, as to be unable to speak for any time without being exhausted. Her death seemed to have been the effect of inanition. Her body, as might have been expected, from the small quan- tity of food she could swallow, was much emaciated. A probang passed readily to the middle of the gullet, but no farther. The preceding symptoms led to the suspicion of stricture in the gullet, and the examination of the body after death shewed that those suspicions were well founded*. Some patients afflicted by this disease, swallow with great difficulty at particular times, and suffer much from what they call a constriction m the throat, that give the sensation of suf- focation, which possibly may be owing to the spasmodic being combined with the organic stricture: there are others who are thrown into convulsions during the effort of swallowing. Towards the termination of the disease, pus is ejected, a proof that there is ulceration of the gullet.

THICKENING OF THE MUCOUS 348 stances that have been swallowed, from worms or concretions within the stomach or intestines, from dysentery, haemorrhoids, from operations performed upon the rectum for the cure of haemorrhoids or fistula ani, and from diseases of the bladder and womb ; in the same manner as strictures of the urethra are often occasioned by repeated gonorrhoea, or urinary calculi; and those of the biliary ducts, by biliary calculi impacted within them. Strictures generally take place in such parts of the gullet, stomach, or intestines, as are naturally of small diameter ; hence stricture of the gullet takes place at the commencement of that tube, or its termination in the stomach; at the cardiac and pyloric orifices of the stomach, more frequently than in the middle of that organ; at the termination of the intestinum ileum, or in the rectum. It has been already observed, that the effusion of coagulable lymph is one of the most common effects of inflammation of the mucous coat, where the inflammation has run high ; and it adds considerably to the thickness of this membrane, so as to dimi- nish the diameter of the canal. The quantity of coagulable lymph effused is very different; sometimes it is as thin as a wafer, on other occasions in such a quantity as to fill the greater part of the affected bowel. In some cases, it forms only a thin lining to the villous coat, or appears in the form of tattered shreds ; in other cases, it fills up the spaces between the valvulae conniventes; in others, it covers these, and sometimes assumes the form of small conical tubercles, which have been minutely described by my uncle Di- Donald Moneo, by Sir John Pringle, and Sir George Baker, as having been often found in the bodies of persons who have died from dysentery. I have also seen a number of small cylindrical Ixxlies, projt*ct- ing from the villous coat of the intestines, which seemed to be chiefly composed of masses of coagulable lymph. A very large quantity of coagulable lymph has in some in- stances, as in the following case which I attended, been dis- charged by stool:â€”

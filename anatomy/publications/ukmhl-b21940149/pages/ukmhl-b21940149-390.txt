342 ACUTE INFI,AMMATI0N OF THE Thus, a stone in the bladder gives rise to the same kind of discharge as a gonorrhoea ; or a leucorrhoea occasions the same discharge as a gonorrhoea; or a stone in the bladder, or the scirrho-contracted rectum, produces symptoms somewhat simi- lar to those of diarrhoea mucosa, or dysentery. OF THE SYMPTOMS OF THE ACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE AIUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE STOMACH. In the present section it is proposed to describe the symptoms of inflammation of the milcous membrane, when it does not ori- ginate from a specific contagion, as from that of fever. This disease is very rare in its acute and idiopathic form, but not un- frequent, as an effect of swallowing poisons; and hence the symptoms of the genuine idiopathic disease are somewhat dif- ferent from those occasioned by acrid poisons. The severity of the symptoms is generally characteristic of the degree of the inflammation; and hence are most severe when an acrid poison, such as the white oxide of arsenic, or the sul- phuric acid, or boiling water, has been swallowed. The symptoms occasioned by taking the white oxide of arse- nic have been already enumerated. It seems necessary to add, that, if the patient survives for a day or two, he suffers much from a sense of heat in his throat, thirst, vomiting, colic, great feebleness, and lassitude, followed by palsy ; and also, that when Fowlerâ€™s elution of arsenic is used as a medicine, it should not be taken upon an empty stomach, as it produces con- siderable uneasiness, and sense of heat at the pra?cordia. Cor- rosive sublimate also occasions violent vomiting and purging, and very violent ])ain in the stomach; and, according to Mr Brodie, proves fatal, by acting chemically on the mucous mem- brane of the stomach so as to destroy its texture, and by the organs more immediately nece.ssary to life being affected in con- sequence of their sympathy with the stomach. Death is sometimes occasioned by drinking cold water, when the Iwdy had lx,en much overheated by dancing. I was ac-

OF DIVERTICUI-A FROM THE INTESTINES. 95 sac, it sometimes happens that a very violent inflammation spreads from the diverticulum to the contiguous intestine; and proves fatal. * The unnatural process does not constitute an essential part of the intestinal canal, and has been cut oft*, when in the sac of a strangulated hernia. Dr Wardrop did so in a case of this description, and after the operation the patient went to stool, and had a complete recovery. Should death ensue in such an instance, it is to be imputed to inflammation excitetl by the re- moval of the diverticulum, and not to strangulation of the in- testine. OJ'lhe Prognosis. In every species of hernia, generally sjK-aking, the prognosis is unfavourable. During infancy, the disease has ol'ten lx?cn cured by pressure alone, especially in cases of umbilical and congenital hernia in children, as there is then a dis}X).sition in the umbilical and •in- guinal apertures to contract; but in advanced life, a complete cure is rarely accomplished in this way; and even when the disease has, in appearance, been removed, it is apt to recur. Besides, Sir A. Cooper has observed, that, though the origi- nal sac may be completely shut at its mouth, by an adhesion to its opposite sides^ another may form at the side of it *. The disease is in general only to be palliated, it seldom proves fatal, unless from accident or neglect, because the hernia can generally be returned and retaineil by projier j)ressurc. It is therefore from a chirurgical operation only, that patients, after puberty, can expect a perfect cure. The danger of the hernia depends upon the cause of the dis- ease, the peculiar constitution, and time of life of the patient; the kind and size of the hernia, the nature of the bowels which fill the tumour, and tlie length of time which has elapsed since the strangulation has happened.

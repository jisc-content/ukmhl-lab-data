OF HYDATIDS. 205 colour of the ink of the cuttle-fish, when these organs liave been reduced to a scirrhous state. Though the arteries proper to the coats of hydatids be very small, yet the watery liquor which fills the hydatid is secreted by them, and in some cases even bone. The hydatid is probably nourished by absorption, and not by continuous vessels from its cyst. It may be compared in structure to the Echinus esculentus of Linn.eus; that is, ab- sorbent vessels take up its nourishment from the containing cyst: and in like manner, the small liydatids contained within a larger hydatid, after being separated from it, or loosened from the ovarium, in which they were formed, suck up tlieir nourisli- ment^rom the liquor of the hydatid which contains them. By what vessels the liquor, which has been absorbed, passes into the cavity of the hydatid, or forms young hydatids, we do not know ; probably such vessels exist as in the echinus. If hydatids contract, upon the application of a stimulus, it must be granted that these are under the influence of nerves, though these nerves be so small as not to be obvious to our imperfect senses. Of the different states in which Hydatids are found. The rudiment of the hydatid is connected to the coats of the pregnant hydatids, and appears with other small hydatids, in the form of small excrescences, which are attached to the large pregnant hydatids. After a time, these small hydatids are detached from the pa- rent hydatid. Hydatids sometimes burst within .their sacs. We sometimes meet with tumours, which are made up en- tirely of pieces of coagulable lymph and hydatids, tlie water having been removed by absorption; hence the tumour does not communicate a sense of fluctuation, as when the hydatids were entire.

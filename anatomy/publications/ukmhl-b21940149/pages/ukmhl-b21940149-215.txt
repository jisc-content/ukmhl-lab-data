elongation of the omentum. 173 OF SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF HERNIA, Occasioned by an unnatural elongation o/^the Omentum passing around a part of the Intestinal Canal. The last class of internal hernia originates from internal mal- conformation, by which stricture, sometimes amounting to strangulation, is made upon a part of the intestinal canal, in consequence of an unnatural opening in the diaphragm, of mal- conforination of the omentum, mesentery, mesocolon, or of an unnatural appendix to the intestines. It seems probable that the adhesion of a portion of omentum to the enlarged uterus or ovarium, proves a cause, on some occa- sions, of derangement of the functions of the alimentary canal. In consequence of the unnatural length of the omentum, it sometimes encircles the intestines; and the degree of stricture thereby produced proves, in some cases, a complete barrier to the course of the faeces, and produces a grt'at distention, inflam- mation, and strangulation of the intestines. I have seen five cases of this description. In three of thc.se the intestinal canal was constricted only at one place by the omentum, but, in the two others, the intestinal canal wa.s con- stricted at three different places. A sixth similar case was communicatctl to me by the late Dr James Anderson. I shall give a brief history of the appearances upon dissec- tion in two of the cases. The first was that of a young woman. The omentum ex- tended to the puljes, and adhered by preternatural short pro- cesses to the ovaria and posterior part of the broad ligament of the uterus. A part of the omentum, which was of a much darker colour than usual, being covered as by a lattice-work of vessels, passed downwards between the convolutions of the ileum, and was fix- ed to the spine. The whole track of the intestines, and more especially the ileum, bore the marks of inflammation.

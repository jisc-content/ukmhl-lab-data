MEMBRANE OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. 345 Besides, many fevers have terminated favourably under the use of stimulants; and such an opinion had led its author to condemn the use of emetics and purgatives as remedies for fe- ver, the former of which have frequently cut short fever in its beginning, and the latter have rendered the symptoms which occur in the progress of fever, much milder. SECTION 111. OF THE ACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE INTESTINAL TUBE. This acute inflammation is either idiopathic or symptomatic. It sometimes appears at the commencement, or in the progress of fevers : it is occasionally the sequel of measles; and some other disorders, as diarrhoea, are the most striking characteristics of this inflammation. It also is very often connected with bad diges- tion, improper food, and vitiated state of the secretion of the sto- mach and intestines, and with various other causes of irritation ; hence the difficulty of discriminating between the symptoms oc- casioned by different acrimonies within the intestinal tube, and those proceeding from a disease of the mucous membrane, which is a matter of much moment, as the former does not prove dan- gerous to life like the latter. According to Dr Abeucrombik, the disease is different, when seated in the mucous membrane itself, or in the mucous follicles, or when “ involving Ixith structures at once.” If the diarrheea be accompanied by pain in the abdomen, painful tenesmus, scanty discharges of bloody mucus, or pure blood, of a watery fluid, or muco-purulent fluid, peculiar irrita- bility of the bowels, thirst, slight degree of fever, and by heat after taking food, and very frequent calls to go to stool, there is reason to suppose the inflammation of the mucous membrane to be the cause of the diarrhoea. If the inflammation be limited to the lower part of the larger intestines, the healthy faeces are retained for a time, and dis- charged in the form of small balls.

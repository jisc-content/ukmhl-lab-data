OF STRICTUKE OF THE RECTUM. 367 swallowino^, anti could only swallow substances of an extremely small size.” The second kind of stricture is occasioned by a pouch, formed in consequence of an extraneous body having lodged within the pharynx. This pouch compresses the gullet, and occasions difficult deglutition. The third kind of stricture is twcasioned by a wound of the intestines. It ha.s been described by Baron Laekey. He ob- serves, that at the tissault of Cairo, in 1799, a man was struck by a bullet, which divided the muscular parietesof the abdomen and a part of the ileum. The two ends of the bowel protruded, were separated from each other, and very much distended. The upper end was erected, its contracted t*dgu strangulating the intestinal tube, as the prepuce does the penis in paraphy- mosis. The progress of the contents <*f the bowels was thus obstructed, and they accumulateil above the consti-iction.* The fourth kind of stricture is occasioned by the scirrhous contraction of some part of the alimentary canal ; the fifth by tumours within that tul)e; the sixth by pressure (X'casiuneil by the increasetl bulk of the neighbouring pirts; and the seventh by prolapse of the rectum, which, on account of inHammation and adhesion, cannot be returneil. Thus the f»ces cannot be passed, and a jx)uch is formed above the strictun*. Mortifica- tion of the rectum generalIv follows. 1 shall subjoin a few remarks on the mode of cure, and on the mechanical means which may be employed for the relief of inflammatory strictures of the gullet, and rectum. According to Boyeb, dysphagia proceeding from organic disease is incurable, as also that connected with an enlartyerl state of the neighbouring glands. Roysch -f- and Haller \ entertain a very different opinion, and have stated cases in which dysphagia, originadug from an enlargement of the lym- • Vide S.

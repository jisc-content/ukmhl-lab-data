< 10 ) CLASS 1. OF EXTRANEOUS BODIES, WHICH, BY THEIR ME- CHANICAL EFFECTS, INJURE THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. SECTION I. OK EXTRANEOUS BODIES LODGED WITHIN DIPPERENT PARTS OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL, AND OP THEIR EFFECTS. The structure of the gullet is peculiarly adapted to allow sub- stances of considerable size to pass through it. This is provided for by the expansive power and elasticity of all its coats, and by the quantity of cellular substance which in- tervenes between the muscular and innermost coat; so that, when it is divided transversely, it resembles one tube included within another. Of the above observation, the following cases afford a strong illustration. The late Mr Alexander Wood gave my father a glass ball, three inches in circumference, which had been swal- lowed by a-child two years old; it passed through the alimen- tary canal in two days, and did not produce a bad symptom. Even substances of considerable length, and sharp at one end, have passed through the alimentary canal, without injuring any part of it. A celebrated artist of this place gave me a small pair of compasses, two inches and a half long, which his daugh- ter, a child three years’ old, had swallowed, and which passed through the alimentary canal in three days, without creating at the time, or afterwards, a distressing symptom. But extraneous substances have frequently been detained in

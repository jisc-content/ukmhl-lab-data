74 OF THE PREDISPOSING CAUSES OF HERNIA. The patient had received a violent blow upon the hack, while moving a sugar cask ; the swelling of the vertebrae immediately followed, and about six months afterwards the tumour at the side of the vertebra? became as large as an orange. When there exists no degree of debility in the parictes of the abdomen, hernia suddenly appears after some violent exertion, as of lifting or carrying a considerable weight; of violent coughing, as in asthma and hooping cough ; of long continued labour : whereas those connected with debility come on slowly, and are of slow and gradual growth. 4</i, The enlargement of the apertures in the parietes of the abdomen predisposes to hernia ; hence the extension of the in- guinal canal, occasioned by the testes passing through it, ren- ders males more subject to hernia congenita, and bubonocele, than females. From a similar cause, women who have had many children at short intervals, or who labour under a dropsy of the ovarium, are frequently afflicted by umbilical hernia. The umbilical ring, in such cases, being distended beyond its natural size, is thereby weakened, and is apt to remain so; especially in those of a relaxed habit of body, even after delivery. This enlargement becomes greater and greater in every fu- ture pregnancy. Upon the same principle, the frequency of hernia in old wo- men who have long laboured under asthma, may be explain- ed. 5f/t, Makonformution of the parietes may be enumerated among the causes with predispose to hernia. The brain, when uncovered, unprotected, and unsupported by the upper part of the skull, has been strmetimes displaced, and then forms a large external tumour *. The thoracic viscera, in consequence of malconformation, have been found upon the outer part ol the chest, or within the abdomen. â€¢ Vide my itlnrbid Anatomy of the Rraiii.

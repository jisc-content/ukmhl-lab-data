UNCOMMON INGUINAL HERNIA 136 Tlie sac is not covered by the cremaster muscle. In this case no part of the tumour is oblique; it passes di- rectly upwards, behind the under abdominal aperture, and the internal oblique and transverse muscles of the abdomen pass across the neck of it. Inguinal Hernice, which hi situation resemhle Crural Hernia^ oxeing to Malcoiiformation of the Inguinal Canal. The fourth modification of inguinal hernia is very rare, and occasioned by the malconformation of the inguinal canal, which is owing to the smaller tendinous fibres, which connect the larger columns of the external oblique muscle, being wanting. In these circumstances the inguinal canal is imperfect; hence the bowels, when protruded, do not follow the course of the in- guinal canal, but push immediately downwards and outwards, forming a tumour in the situation of a crural hernia. This modification of hernia has been described by the late Professor Hamilton of Glasgow, and also by Petit. It re- mained for the late Mr Allan Burns of Glasgow to detect the cause of such a deviation, which he has described to me in the following letter, dated March 7, 1806: “ The tumour was found in the bend of the left thigh. The inguinal canal was fully as large as it is usually met with in the male, and besides, so very short, that it presented, when fully unfolded, almost the appearance of a mere aperture. The round ligament of the womb was enveloped in a distinct tunica vaginalis, and bearing the same relation to the intestine that the spermatic cord does in the other sex. On the right side, the herniary sac was about two inches in length, and in shape resembled a Florence flask; the bulbous extremity ex- tending from the lower orifice of the canal, was contained in the upper part of the thigh, lying more in the course of a crural than of an inguinal hernia. “ This deviation from the usual direction of the tumour was produced by a premature separation from each of the external

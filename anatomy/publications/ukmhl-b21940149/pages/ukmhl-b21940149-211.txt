169 OF THE HERNIA OBTURATORIA. My Father met with a case nearly similar to that described by Papen *, which forms an exception to the above remark : the tumour was of large size. Verdier has described an in- stance of this hernia, in which the base of the tumour was of large size, and it contained not only the omentum, the jejunum, and ileum, but also the caecum and lower jxjrtion of the colon, and even a part of the rectum. OK THE HERNIA OBTURATORIA. By the hernia obturatoria is to be understootl a protrusion of the bowels through the obturator aperture, at the upper and inner part of the thigh, very near to the scrotum of the male, or labium of the female. This is also a rare kind of hernia, and frecjuently discovered only after the patient’s death, on account of the small size of the swelling, its deep situation, and its producing no very obvious external tumour. The tumour, which is more common in women than in men, is prevented from extending by the first and second heads of the triceps and pectinalis muscles, under which it lies. ]\Ir Cloquet has lately described a case of this hernia. A tumour, containing a mortified jxirtion of intestine, about the size of a small hen’s egg, proved fatal. After death, the tu- mour was found to be covered by the adductor longus and pectincus muscles. OF THE PERINEAL HERNIA t. The perineal hernia falls under the third class of internal hernise; for, at the commencement of the disease, there is no external tumour and sometimes, as in the case which hap- pened to Dr Maclaurin §, symptoms of strangulation occur, and the patient dies, though there exists no external tumour. • Vide Haller, Disput.

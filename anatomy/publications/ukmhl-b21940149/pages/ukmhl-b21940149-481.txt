I SECTION XVIII. ! i I OF FUNGUS OF THE MUCOUS COAT OF THE ALIMEN- I TARY CANAL, AND OF FUNGOUS TUMOURS CON- NECTED WITH THAT MEMBRANE. ► [ I Fungous tumours have been observed in every part of the i alimentary canal. I Such tumours are generally of a small size, of a very soft consistence, bleed when torn, and generally are composed of se- veral small lobules. I have seen the uvula and uppt'r part of the pharynx covertnl I by a number of such tumours, of a small size; and the mem- I brane from which these grew was of a dark purple colour, seemed 1 considerably thickened, and was in some places erotletl. Ulce- I ration also sometimes takes place, and the fungous tumours of- I ten assume a malignant aspect. I My Father met with a case of fungus of the pharynx, which j occupied a considerable share of its internal membrane, and also I that of the upper part of the gullet, which was thereby very I much thickened; the patient died from inanition: ulceration I had taken place in some of the fungous excrescences. ’ M. Kerkaradec shewed to the Royal Academy of Medicine i the pharynx of a woman, set. 60, which was covered with fun- II gous vegetations, that had a cauliflower appearance.

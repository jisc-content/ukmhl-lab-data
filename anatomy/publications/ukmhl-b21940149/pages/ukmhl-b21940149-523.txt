In some cases, clysters have been vomited in a few minutes after they have been received, which affords a presumption of the existence of an unnatural communication between the arch of the colon and the stomach. It ought to be recollected, however, that clysters will often be vomited, if injected incautiously, and in large quantities, particularly if the patient be much exhausted. OF THE APPEARANCE AND SYMPTOMS OF SCIRRHOUS RECTUM. By this disease ihe coats of the bowel are intimately united ; thickened, and also indurated; and, according to Ruysh, are sometimes of cartilaginous hardness, and the mucous coat forms hal'd and irregular folds. The tunics of one side of the bowel are often much thicker than those of the opposite, so as to render the |iassage of the feces through the rectum indirect, which is increased by the contraction of the muscular coat; the bowel is expanded above the constriction, owing to the accumulation of its contents, and the muscular fibres are increased in size, in proportion to the re- sistance and duration of the disease. The breadth of the part more immediately constricted is va- rious ; it seldom exceeds two or three inches. There is also much variety as to the degree of constriction. There is generally a difficulty in passing a bougie of the size of the little finger; and sometimes the stricture is so great as only to admit a surgeonâ€™s probe. A number of cartilaginous bands may sometimes be observed passing transversely between the outer and inner coats of the scirrhous rectum. The disease frequently extends beneath that portion of the peritoneum, which is reflected over the os sa- crum.

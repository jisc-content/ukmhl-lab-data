OF AIK ACCUMUJ.ATEl) WITHIN THE 410 tents discharged into the cavity of the abdomen, which would prove fatal. My father, many years ago, published the subjoined obser- vations on the accumulation of air within the alimentary ca- nal of oxen and sheep. “ The swelling of the belly is owing to the distention of the stomach, and particularly the first stomach, by fixed air or carbonic acid gas, which is disengaged from the tender and suc- culent grass, in consequence of its quick solution and violent fermentation; while the discharge of it upwards, through the gullet, seems to be prevented by a spasm or muscular contrac- tion of the upper orifice of the stomach. The dangerous and other fatal effects which follow the distention are not owing to the fixed air, or the juices of the fermented grass, acting as poi- sons upon the stomach, as a moderate quantity of either produ- ces no bad effects; besides, the repeated experience of the gra- zier has shewn, that many cattle are immediately relieved and preserved, by stabbing them with a knife or trocar, or by for- cing a rope down their throats, and thus allowing the air to escape. “ Cattle, therefore, may with certainty be saved, if the air be drawn off in due time, without injuring the stomach or bowels; and this may easily be done, by passing a flexible tube from the mouth down the gullet, and into the stomach. “ This tube is to be composed of an iron-wire, much larger than a common stocking-wire, or about one-tenth part of an inch in diameter. In order to give it the cylindrical form, it is to be twisted around a thick rod of iron ; and, after taking it off the rod around which it was turned, it is to be covered with smooth leather. “ To the end of the tube, which is intended to be passed into the stomach, a brazen pipe, two inches long, of the same size as the tube, and pierced with a number of holes, is to be firmly connected. “ To prevent the tube from bending too much within the mouth or gullet, in time of passing it down into the stomach, an iron-wire, one-cighth of an inch in diameter, and of the same

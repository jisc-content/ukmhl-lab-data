OF THE PROGNOSIS OF HERNIA. 98 Mr Pott has published two such cases, which throw much light upon this branch of the subject. He observes, that an old gentleman, who had an irreducible hernia, complained of great pain in his whole belly, but particu- larly about his navel; he was hot and restless, and had a frequent inclination to vomit; his pulse was full, hard and frequent; and he had been, contrary to his usual custom, three days without a stool. “ I examined his rupture very carefully,” says Mr Pott ; “ the process was large and full^ as usual, hut not at all tense or pahifil upon being handled; his belly was much swollen and hard, and he could hardly bear the light pressure of a hand about his navel. Upon mature consideration of the whole, I was of opinion, that his rupture had no share in his present complaints^ Notwithstanding the opinion of Mr Pott, the operation was performed, and the patient died on the sixth day. Upon dissec- tion, “ the hernial sac was thick and hard, and contained a large portion of omentum, a piece of the ilium, and a portion of the colon, all perfectly sound, free from infiammation or stricture, and irretumable only from quantity. But the in- testinum jejunum was greatly distended, highly inflamed, and in some parts sphacelated.” OF ABDOMINAL HERNI.®. I Having premised such general observations, I shall now en- deavour to describe the anatomy of the parts concerned in ab- dominal herniae. Thus an accurate knowledge of the situation of the tumour,—of the various causes which oppose a m(x;hani- cal obstacle to the return of the prolapsed bowels—of the cause of the greater frequency of some Iiernia; among men than women—of the safest and surest method of removing the dis- ease by pressure, or by chirurgical operation, and also the means of preventing its return, can alone be obtaincxl.

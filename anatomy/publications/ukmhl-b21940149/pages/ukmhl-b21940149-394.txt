THlCKENlNti or THE MUCOUS 346 Of this inflammation there are various degrees, and great variety as to the symptoms ; and hence, upon dissection, healthy hardened faeces may be found in one portion of the intestine; whilst the contiguous part of the tube contains fluid faeces. In some cases, little else than a bloody mucous fluid is dis- charged ; but, when the inflammation has been seated only in the smaller intestines, the evacuations are healthy. This inflammation sometimes subsides, sometimes it proves fatal in its inflammatory stage ; or it terminates in ulceration or gangrene, or is propagated to the peritoneal coat, and occasions peritonitis, occasionally in consequence of perforation of the coats of the intestines. It has been already observed that the spasmodic contraction of the intestinal tube is frequently followed by inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intestine. Those who are subject to such spasmodic affections are liable to occasional constipation, colic pains, and occasional nausea. When inflammation follows the spasmodic attack, the patient is suddenly seized with tenesmus and acute pain in his belly, followed by thirst and vomiting, and the pulse is quick and small. But the pain is not much increased on pressure, nor is the abdomen tense, as in the peritonitis. In the progress of the disease, repeated vomiting occurs, and death ensues in the course of two or three days. Upon dissection, a part of the intestine is found to be much contracted, and the mucous coat is at that place inflamed ; and, what is remarkable, though the obstruction be in the smaller in- testine, yet inflammation occasionally occurs in the mucous membrane of the stomach, in consequence of the obstruction in the intestines. Inflammation of the intestine is also often combined with stricture, and sometimes does not extend far beyond the seat of the stricture; but, on other occasions, it is propagated to the whole of the intestinal tube above the stricture.

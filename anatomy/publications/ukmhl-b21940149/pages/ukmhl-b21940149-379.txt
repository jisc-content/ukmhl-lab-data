331 aksenic and its oxides. Experiment 3.—'Six grains oi metallic arsenic, in powder, were given to a dog; but they produced no obvious effect. From the above experiments, it follows, that the metallic arsenic may be taken by a dog with impunity, to tlie extent of several grains. Experiment 4.—Ten grains of metallic arsenic were given to a middle-sized dog, mixed with the extract of gentian, at three o’clock p. M. At five o’clock the animal seemed but little af- fected. At seven o’clock v. m. severe vomiting and purging of a bilious fluid had come on, which continued for several hours. He passed a great deal of urine ; the pulse Ix'came extremely quick and feeble. Next day, at one o’clock p. m., I saw the dog; his pulse was so very quick that I could not count it, and also very feeble. He seemed extremely weak, and refused every kind of food; and I thought he would have diet!; but on the following day he took food, and on the next day seemed quite well. EXPERIMENTS WITH THE Bl.ACK OXIDE OF ARSENIC. This oxide is prepared by exposing the arsenic, m its metal- lic state, when broken into very small pieces, to the air for some time. Mr Renault’s experiments upon this oxide have proved the very poisonous effects of it. It is certainly very remarkable, that this substance should be so extremely poisonous to animals, even when the quantity of oxygen it has gained is so trifling as hardly to add to its weight. I requested Mr Graham to repeat Mr Renault’s experi- ments with this oxide, and to attend particularly to the state of the pulse, and to its effects upon the digestive and urinary or- gans.

Hydatids have also been found in parts of a scirrhous struc- ture ; and they have been stated by writers on midwifery fre- quently to give rise to abortion, and to the destruction of the ovum ; or the hydatids are said, to be formed after the destruc- tion of the ovum, or of the retention of a part'of the placenta, or in consequence of coagula remaining in utero. The symp- toms of hydatids in utero bear a strong resemblance to those of pregnancy. The number of the hydatids in a blighted ovum varies very much ; in some, the whole, or a greater part, of the mass is converted into hydatids. It is not improper to add that Mr Thuiller has described a case, in which hydatids were discharged from the middle un- til towards the end of pregnancy *.

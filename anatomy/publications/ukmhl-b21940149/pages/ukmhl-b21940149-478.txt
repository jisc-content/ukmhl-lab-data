OF POLYPI IN THE STOMACH. 4ii0 In cases of cancer at the jjylorus and rectum, I have seen a number of small tumours of different sizes, with narrow necks, which gave rise to symptoms nearly similar to those just men- tioned. Polypi in the rectum differ somewhat in appearance, from those already described, being generally smaller in size, and two, three, or even a greater number, occasionally exist in the same subject; and, when the patient is at stool, they often project beyond the verge of the anus.

About ten or twelve years ago, she began to complain of constant uneasiness in the rectum, with occasional prolapsus ani. These symptoms, by degrees, grew worse ; frequent attacks of very severe inflammation of the parts took place, with profuse discharges of blood, and tlie pro- lapsus became almost constant, unless retained .by a bandage. The violence of these complaints greatly injured the general health, and in particular the functions of the stomach and in- testines were much affected. Upon examination of the parts during a corajJete prolapsus, a firm flesliy-looking tumour was found withiu the sphincter, about the size of a chesnut, with a broad base. It was proposed to remove this, but at first this * Vide t)Tauk’s Works.

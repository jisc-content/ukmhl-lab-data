INTIIODUCTION. XVlll rious occasions of observing the more interesting forms of disease, and of examining morbid appearances. Besides, in the prosecution of such researches, I recei- ved the greatest assistance from the extensive field of observation and experience which my Father long en- joyed, and which (for even the partialities of a son do not disqualify me to bear witness to the fact) he most anxiously laboured, through a long life of varied and useful exertion, to improve. From the commencement of his professional career, he made it an invariable rule to collect and register the important cases that had fallen under his notice, to sub- join liis observations on each, and, in the event of the patientâ€™s death, to examine the body with minute at- tention. He also, as often as circumstances permitted, preserved the affected parts, with an accurate description of the morbid appearances. The extensive collection of diseased preparations formed by the industry of my Father, and lately much augmented, has afforded me an opportunity which few have had, of investigating the nature of morbid changes ; for that collection now contains specimens of almost every disease connected with organic derangement, so disposed as to exhibit a regular view of its progress. In these circumstances, I shoidd hold myself inex- cusable, were I to neglect so fair an opportunity of im- proving, or at least of attempting to improve, this part of my profession, by communicating to the world a great number of facts, collected from actual observation of the dead body, the force or import of wliich ciinnot he weak- ened by false reasoning or ill-founded hypothesis, and which constitute a chain of evidence to which few am refuse their assent.

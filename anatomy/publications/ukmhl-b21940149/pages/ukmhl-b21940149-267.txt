The ova are elliptical: those which are mature are placed l)ehind the venti’al sucker, “ cirro edenda.” The others are dis- persed every where throughout the body. Bremser conjectures the tubes seen in the middle of the l)ody to be the oviducts; and Uiat those whicli are situated at the sides of the worm compose the alimentary canal. Some authors have asserted, that they are met with iu the ramifications of the vena |X)rtarum. Aware of tliis opinion, I have examined the liver of the sheep, with a view of ascertain- iiiff tlie habitat of the.se animals, and have never found them in the bloodvessels, but have always observed them to Uxlge in the biliary ducts. From the biliary ducts they fre(|uently find their way into the duodenum, and are discharged per anum. They not unfrequently attack sheep and cattle epidcviically. The Distoma hepaticum is but rarely met with in man. I have never seen it in any human liver or gall-bladder, ivor pre- served in any museum. In the sheep it is very common. C^'a New Species of Ojri/uris. Mr Uhjnd has described, in liis valuable Treatise on Worms*, a new species of the oxyuris, and termed it the Oxyuris angu- lata. It is about two inches in length. The Ixxly is bent in the form of a very obtuse angle. Its head is furnished with a proboscis, in the centre of which is a small mouth. The tail is six-eighths of an inch in length, of a tajxM-ing form, and alxait one-third of the tliickuess of the body of the worm. Of Imperfect Worms. The Tamia solium is generally passed in detached portions, varying from six to eight inches in length, especially if no powerful anthelmintic has been exhibited. Sometimes, however, separate articuU are passed. Couletus called them a species of Ascaris. Others considered them to be peculiar worms, by » Edin. 1829.

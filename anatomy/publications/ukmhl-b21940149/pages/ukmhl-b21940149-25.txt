XIX INTRODUCTION. Having offered these preliminary remarks on the nature and importance of the subject, and on the-con- siderations which strongly recommended it to my atten- tion, I proceed to explain the general plan of the Work. It consists of two Parts: the First containing a des- cription of the morbid appearances discovered by dis- section ; the Second a relation of the symptoms which preceded the patient’s death. On this relation, a com- parison is instituted between tlie symptoms whicli pre- ceded death, and the appearances iliscovered by dissec- tion. AVith the exception of a few cases, whicli seemeil to require particular consideration, I have confined my statements within these limits, leaving the reader to draw his own conclusions. And thougli this instance of reserve may expose me to criticism, I am persuaded, that, in the present state of tlic science, the more enlightened practitioner will do justice to tlie motive by wliich I have been actuated ; facts being of more importance than opinions, till the former can be generalized, and reduced into a common law. In justification of this method, and of the views from which it has proceeded, it may not be unnecessary to re- mark, that, in treating of Morbid Anatomy, different authors have adopted diff’erent plans. Witli some, it forms an appendage only to a book on Natural Ana- tomy ; but a subject so extensive, so complicated in its nature, and so unspeakably useful in its practical appli- cations, can never be treated with the requisite precision, till it be converted into a distinct branch of inquiry. Other authors, impressed with this conviction, have swelled their books to an immoderate size, by the inser- tion ot superfluous cases. Where the diseased appearance is so frequent as to ad-

OF THE ALIMENTAllY CANAL. 453 size of a small orange, and whieh exhibit the genuine scir- rhous structure, and these tumours so completely obstruct the pylorus that the stomach, filled with its liquid contents, may be compressed without any part of the liquid escaping into the duodenum. From the duration of the disease, the scirrhous part becomes softer and ulcerated in the centre, and we sometimes meet with, within the stomach, apertures of one or two inches in diameter, which are bounded by a distinctly scirrhous and ulcerated por- tion. 4/A, There is often a fungus from the ulcer, which has ragged, unequal, and retorted edges. The ulcer is then said to be in a cancerous state, and this sometimes extends over a con- siderable portion of the stomach. In some instances the coats of the stomach are eroded by the ulceration, so that the bowel communicates with the cavity of the abdomen, and sometimes with the navel. We also occa- sionally, though rarely, meet with, at the same time cancerous ulceration of the duodenum. The lymphatic glands, in the smaller curvature of the sto- mach, are generally also scirrhous or cancerous, and often con- siderably enlarged. OF SCIRRHUS x\ND CANCER OF THE GULLET. Scirrhus of the gullet is generally limited to the cardia, which seems referable to the greater number of glands in that situa- tion. But scirrhus sometimes pervades every part of the gullet. Ulceration frequently occurs above the seat of the disease, af- ter it has lasted for some time; thus, a communication is some- times established between the gullet and the trachea, which speedily proves fatal.

( Go ) SECTION II. OF PROCIDENTIA ANI. The procidentia ani differs but little from an intus-susceptio, and is more frequent during infancy and old age than in the meridian of life. Prolapsus ani is also the sequel of injuries of the spine, and of other causes which induce weakness or palsy of the sphincter ani muscle. Irritation constantly applied is also a source of prolapsus; and hence it frequently is symptomatic of worms, hemorrhoids, or of stone in the bladder, and is sometimes produced by the frequent use of warm and stimulating clysters; and in women by a prolapsus uteri. In infants, the disease assumes the form of a small vascular tumour at the anus, but, in the adult, it appears in the form of one or two loose Haps, of a |iale colour; but occasionally we meet with a tumour as large, or even larger, than an orange, which is formed by the greater share of the larger intestine. My grandfather has publishetl the history of a child who died from the disease; and, upon dissection, it was found tliat the inversion began a little lx?low the upper part of the sigmoid ffexure of the colon, and the mesocolon was tom away from the inverted piu-t. In the adult, the villous coat of the rectum is, in some cases, only displaced, forming folds. When the disease has been removetl it is very apt to return. If the prolapsus be not sjieetlily removed, it is followed by swelling, the unnatural discharge of mucus, inflammation, and sometimes by gangrene, occasioned by the contraction of the sphincter ani, and it is accompanied by the symptoms of sti'ajj- gulated hernia. It is sometimes impossible to return the prolapse, in conse- quence of the distention of the cellular membrane by coagula of E

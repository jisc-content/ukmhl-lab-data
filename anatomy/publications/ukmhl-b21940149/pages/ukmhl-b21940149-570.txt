OF TUBERCLES 514 18^/i, That sometimes the symptoms of the disease are very obscure. Lastly^ That chronic peritonitis is sometimes combined with organic diseases of the mesenteric glands, liver, spleen, lungs, or omentum, and that, in this form of disease, the jieritoneum is much thickened, and sometimes considerably indurated; and its different portions frequently adhere to each other to a greater or less extent, or to the parietes of the alxlomen. SECTION V. OF ULCERATION OF THE PERITONEUM. This morbid condition of the membrane has been sometimes but by no means frequently observed *. According to Broussais, perforation took place in one of sixteen cases of chronic peritonitis. SECTION VI. OF TUBERCLES OF THE PERITONEUM. Tubercles of the peritoneum are generally of a greyish co- lour, various in size and number. In a few instances, they are limited to a portion of the membrane; but, in others, they ex- tend over the greater part of the peritoneum, and sometimes oc- cur when the peritoneum is in a state of chronic inflammation. They are occasionally as small as pins’ heads, at other times large, of a caseous consistence, and somewhat softened in their centre, and they excite inflammation of the membranes. I have seen such tubercles attached to all the serous mem- branes, but most frequentlv to the peritoneum. • Broussais, Phlegniasies Cliroii. sect. ii. cliup. vi. J.

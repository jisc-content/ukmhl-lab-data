PERITONEAL COAT OF THE INTESTINES. 507 This subacute or chronic peritonitis, is sometimes consequent to the acute form of the disease, or to scarlatina and measles; and it has been sometimes combined with diseased mesenteric glands, or with diseases of the lungs, or extensive suppuration within the abdomen, or tubercles of the peritoneum. I have given cases of acute peritonitis, arising from external injury ; the chronic form of the disease has been sometimes in- duced by the same cause. The chronic peritonitis is by no means rare, is often very in- sidious in its origin, comes on without a very obvious cause, and is also obscure in its progress, and often fatal in its consequences, unless it be obviated at or near to its commencement. This form of peritonitis is sometimes connected with perfora- tion, proceeding from without inwards, and is caused by the suppuration of tubercles. Dropsy of the abdomen is occasionally a consequence of in- flammation of the peritoneum, and the consistence, as well as the other sensible properties of the dropsical fluid, are very various, as well as the rapidity with which it is effused ; generally it is limpid, and straw or greenish coloured, but occasionally brown, and somewhat like coffee in colour, and mixed with albuminous matter. A fluid is sometimes found under the peritoneal coat of the intestines, and under the muscular parietes of the abdomen. According to Dr Bright *, w'hen the urine is coagulable by heat, in those who have died from dropsy, the kidneys are al- ways diseased. A sero-purulent fluid is frequently secreted by the inflamed vessels, and in very considerable quantity, especially in women who have died after child-beai'ing. Pus is also occasionally secreted by the serous membranes, when these are inflamed, and without lesion or ulceration of their surfaces. • Dr Bright’s Reports on the appearances observable in diseases ter- minating in dropsical effusion, merit pecuUar attention. 1

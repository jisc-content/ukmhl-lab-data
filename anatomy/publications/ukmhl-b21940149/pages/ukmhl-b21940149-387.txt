ON THE EFFECTS OF OPIUM. 33}^ “ The rest of the liquid was divided into three parts; to the tirst a variety of reagents were added, which indicated the presence of albumen ; corrosive sublimate producing a copi- ous precipitate, and sulphuric acid, when added in sufficient quantity, causing the characteristic colour, pointed out by Dr Hope, which it gives with albumen, and similar to what it pro- duced with a dilute solution of albumen in a comparative ex- periment. Nitrate of silver gave a copious precipitate, as was to have been expected, but nothing more of any moment was observed in the experiments performed with this portion of the liquid. “ The test that I depended on principally for ascertaining if any opium were present, was the red sulphate of iron, which produces st> deep a colour with meconic acid ; and Dr Hake affirms, that in this manner he has detected the presence of opium in solution, when only ten drops of laudanum hatl been added to half a gallon of water *. To apply this test, acetate of lead (in solution) was added cautiously to the second por- tion of the fluid, as long as any precipitate took place, and sul- phuric acid ailded to it afterwards, to decom])ose any meconiate of lead that might have been formed, and disengage the me- conic acid; a solution of the red sulphate wiis then dropjjed upon it, but no change took place, indicating the absence of meconic acid, and c'onsequenlly of opium. “ The third }iortion was evaporated to dryness by a very gentle heat (not exceeding 100^ of Falirenheit), and about four gnvins of a solid residuum obtained, part of which was dissolved by digestion in tdcohol, and appeared to be osmazome, the re- mainder being albumen. “ I ought to have mentioned, that, after the liquid had been Altered, part of it was shaken in a flask with some animal char- coal, to remove the colouring matter, and filtered a second time; it was acted on in the same manner as the rest by the different reagents.” Mr Cooke, in his edition of Morgagni, has made mention of so great turgescence of vessels upon the mucous coat of tffe • Quarterly .Toumal, New Series, vol. ii.

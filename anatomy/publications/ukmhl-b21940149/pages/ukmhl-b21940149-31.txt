XXV INTRODUCTION. When the facts relative to an order of diseases, and the known inodes of cure, are fully ascertained, it may be permitted to the philosophical inquirer to begin the process of generalization, and to draw the ultimate conclusions which the knowledge thus acquired may seem to warrant. This is the order of science, and the only method of procedure, from which can be expected any improvement substantial or usefid. Every addition to our knowledge concerning the ori- gin, the progress, the symptoms, and other concomitants of disease, is an instrument of further discovery, and a source of power to the skilful practitioner; at once correcting and extending his vision; directing him in the examination of his patients; enabling liim to detect the latent cause of the evil, to which he is called to mi- nister ; and awakening his ingenuity to disarm or oppose its malignant influence. At the same time it ouglit to be remembered, that to discover the reasons of the failure of the different at- tempts made to remove the cause, or obviate the effects of organic derangement, constitutes an acquisition of the first importance in tlie Practice of Medicine. Even in those distressing cases, where there is no hope of an ultimate cure, such knowledge may still be valu- able in directing us to the means of soothing and sus- taining the patient during his lingering conflict, and of giving him all the relief of which his condition is suscep- tible. Reflections like these are not ill calculated to i^)use the industry and ambition of those who are engaged in Las lately been publisbed. This Catalogue, which contains not only a description of the morbid appearances, but also of the symptoms of the more remarkable cases, will be found to be frequently referred to in the following work.

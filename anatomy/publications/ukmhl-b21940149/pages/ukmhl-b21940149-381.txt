BLACK OXIDE OF ARSENIC. 333 cent bile. The kidneys exhibited appearances of inflammation. The bladder of urine I found containing an immense quantity of urine, of a dark colour, and of a very offensive smell. None of the thoracic viscera were affected, nor was the brain. “ One grain of this oxide seemed at first to have very little effect upon the other dog. Natural pulse, at the beginning of the experiment, eighty-two, full and strong. “ At twelve, pulse 100. A teasing nausea tormented it, which was generally alleviated by a discharge of bile. Purg- ing, though it was seldom, appearetl to be chiefly of mucus and bile. No shivcrings were produced, but considerable moaning. In this animal, too, the discharge of urine was increasetl to an astonishing degree, but of a darkish hue, and disagreeable smell. At two, many of these phenomena had disappeared. Pulse eighty-four, weak ; purging almost gone, as was the nau- sea ; but the discharge of urine still continued to be pretema- turally augmented, though it was now of a more natural colour and odour. At this time, I presented him some food, which he devoured with avidity, and seeme<l to be much relieved, as at four o’clock there did not seem to lx? any unnatural symp- tom, debility excepted.” These experiments shew the very highly stimulating proper- ties of this oxide of arsenic iqxm the gullet’and secretory organs. OF THE SYMPTOMS OCCASIONED BY THE WHITE OXIDE OF ARSENIC BEING SWALLOWED. The white oxide of arsenic is more commonly employed as a poison ; and it proves fatal even in small doses. It has been proved by repeated observation, that two grains of this oxide prove fatal to man in a short time. When taken in any considerable quantity, it produces the most violent inflammation of the inner coat of the gullet and There were no marks of inflammation in the mucous coat of the stomach or intestines, which was covered with a very tenacious mucus.

XXll INTltOnuCTION. 1st, Peculiarity ot constitution, sex, manner of life, the imperfect manner in which patients describe their ailments, and the erroneous account which many phy- sicians lead their patients to give of their situation, from taking up too hasty an opinion respecting the nature of the case. 2d, The imperfect knowledge we possess of the func- tions of some of the organs of the body. Thus, it is dif- ficult to determine whether the Spleen be diseased, un- less it has attained so great a bulk, as to be felt by an external examination. 3d, The different diseases to which several of the bowels are subject. Thus, in the diseases of the Heart, palpitation often obscures those less obvious symptoms which are characteristic of the particular disease ; and, in the same manner, jaundice is a feature of very dif- ferent diseases of the Liver, and delirium of very op- posite diseases of the Brain. 4th, The remarkable sympathy between neighbouring, and even distant organs, renders the source of the dis- ease doubtful. Thus, the Stomach sympathizes with the bowels ; and the functions of many of the bowels are deranged by a disordered state of the stomach. It is also to be taken into account, that distant sen- sations, or sympathetic feelings, frequently create the most acute pain, and give probably the earliest notice of the internal mischief. From the nature or cause of the disease being im- perfectly understood, or mistaken, the most baneful con- sequences originate. The disease is neglected, or unskilfully treated at its beginning; the opportunity is lost of arresting its progress or mitigating its severity; or it is aggravated by an im- proper method of treatment. How often, for example,

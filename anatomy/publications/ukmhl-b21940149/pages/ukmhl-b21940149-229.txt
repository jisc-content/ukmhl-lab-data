There are several different species of worms which are pro- per to the human alimentary canal, and which are capable of living within it, viz. the Teniae or tape worms, the Ascaris lum- bricoides, or long round worm, and the Ascaris vermicularis, or short round worm, &c. The Trichuris, and one or two other species, were unknown to the antients. My pupil Dr William Elford Leach, a distinguished na- turalist, had, for several years, devoted much attention to those worms that infest the human alimentary canal, and had formed a large collection of them, from which, and from those in the Museum of the University, and from that of the late Dr Bar- clay, he drew out the annexed arrangement of them into genera and species, which has been printed verbatim, from a manuscript • Tentomen Med.

299 OK GANORENK OK MUSCLES. I have endeavoured lo determine whether the pus is lodged in the cellular substance between the muscular fibres, or in the muscular fibre itself, and I am inclined to adopt the former of these opinions, which receives support from the circum- stance of muscles of the extremities being frequently detached from each other, by suppuration in the cellular substance around them, in the same manner as the coats of the intestines are, on some occasions, detached from each other, in consequence of inflammation having given rise to the formation of a gootl deal of pus, which is effused between their coats. It has been already observed, that, when suppuration lake.*> place within the muscles, generally the pus is formed more fre- quently in tlie cellular substance uniting the muscular fasciculi, than in the substance of the muscular fibre. But it must also be admitted that there are instances of the complete destruc- tion of some muscles by suppuration, as in the disease caliinl Iâ€™soas abscess. In that case we often meet with a large* abai'ess, and scarcely a vestige of the great psoas muscle. Further, the fasciculi of the muscular fibres are in some instances dischargwi at the upper and inner part of the thigh, along with purulent matter. OK GANGRENE OF MUSCLES. Gangrene of muscles is by no means common, and is, I believe, often confounded with effusion of venous bhxxl be- tween the fasciculi of the muscle, and that softening of the mus- cles which is the effect of inflammation. Gangrene of the mus- cular coats of the intestines is by no means an uncommon result of very acute inflammation of the intestines, and is some- times observed in strangulated herniae.

84 CAUSES OF STRANGULATION. at length there Is a total stoppage of the contents of the her- niated intestine. The accumulation of faeces sometimes leads to a low species of inflammation of the hernial sac, and of its contents; hence the sac contracts an adhesion with the neighbouring parts, and also with the aperture through which the displaced bowel passed. A relaxed habit of body, and the dilatation of the inguinal canal, do not always prevent strangulation, which may origi- nate from various causes. An extraordinary quantity of air within the alimentary canal, or violent coughing, vomiting, or sneezing suddenly, forcing more intestine into the hernial sac, or the accumulation of faeces, by which the coats of the dis- placed intestines lose their tone, may induce immediate stran- gulation, and its fatal consequences. When a portion of intestines passes into the neck of a hernial sac, which has been thickened, condensed, and contracted, by wearing a truss, strangulation may be produced. A transverse bridle in the hernial sac, occasioned by preter- natural adhesions ; a fissure in the omentum, when much indu- rated, or foreign bodies swallowed, may produce the strangu- lation. When a hernia is strangulated, the patient becomes feverish, and suffers from the tension of the tumour: provided the stran- gulation be not removed, inflammation follows. The strangulation generally proceeds from the unnatural ac- cumulation of faeces within the displaced intestines. The patient does not suffer instant acute pain. The progress of the swelling and of the inflammation in such debilitated constitutions, is not so rapid as in the more robust and plethoric, so that an operation often proves a cure, even when performed several days after strangulation has taken place.

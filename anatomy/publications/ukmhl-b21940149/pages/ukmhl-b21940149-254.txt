210 OF THE CONCOMITANT Of the Concomitant Symptoms. As the history of the symptoms occasioned by I)ydatids, can be collected only from a variety of cases, I have subjoined seve- ral of those which have fallen under the observation of my Fa- ther and of myself. Case I.—A stout man, 20 years of age, complained of con- stant headach, chiefly on the right side, followed by a dilatation of the pupil, and epileptic fits, which proved fatal to him. On dissection, the cranium was found to be much thinner on the right than on the left side, particularly the right parietal bone, which in many places was not thicker than a wafer. On opening the right ventricle of the brain, a cyst about the size of a goose’s egg was found within it, filled with a watery liquor, and surrounded by a gelatinous matter, which did not adhere to the membrane lining the ventricle. Dr Grieve Mackenzie, who had attended the patient, was so obliging as to send the cyst to my Father, which appeared to me of the same structure as that of pregnant hydatids. Case II.—A stout man, 26 years of age, had a large swel- linsr, in which fluctuation could be felt, connected with the con- cave part and under edge of his liver. As there had been no symptoms of inflammation or suppuration, my Father supposed the swelling to be owing to a cyst filled with hydatids within the liver. Mr Andrew Wood, who also visited the patient, was of the same opinion. Soon after this, the patient vomited a great number of hydatids, of different sizes. In the course of the four following years, the sac filled again, and discharged itself into the stomach repeatedly. The liver was .sensibly enlarged, and had de.scended about an inch lower than the edges of the ribs, and was somewhat more sensible to the touch tlian usual. The patient’s liver gradually became smaller, and at length retreated within the margin of the chest. 1

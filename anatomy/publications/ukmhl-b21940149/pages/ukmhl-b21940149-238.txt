194 ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE. The body has a rugose appearance, and there are four linos placed nearly at equal distances, which pass along the animal; two of these are much more aj)parent than the other, from be- ing much broader. By these lines, fibres, probably circular muscles, arc inter- sected in such a manner that each consists of two semicircular portions.

The muscles, which are seen through the skin, do not sur- round the worm, but are, according to Dr Hooper, two distinct sets of muscles which act in opposition to each other; and each of the two longitudinal lines which extend from the head to the tail of the worm, are composed of two distinct tendons,' which serve for the attachment of the semilunar muscles, which cover the whole of the worm. The cuticle, and true skin, are so transparent, that I have been able to distinguish the sex of the animal through these. The abdomen, which is lined by a fine membrane, which may be called pei'itoneum, contains a transparent fluid, the in- testinal tube, and an apparatus which is subservient to genera- tion. The CEsophagus, at its beginning, is small; it continues in- creasing in size. In the abdomen, where it may be called Sto- macb or Intestinal Canal, it is cajiable of receiving a common- sized surgeonâ€™s probe ; and, about a quarter of an inch from the anus, it becomes narrower and straighter. The alimentary tube is filled by greenish matter. Some have supposed this worm to be hermaphrodite; but the sexes generally appear distinct. I have remarked, that the females are larger and more nu- merous than the males; and arc generally in the projxwtion of four or five to one. The parts of generation begin, or rather terminate, near the -

MEMBRANE OF THE AEIMENTARY CANAL. .349 The patient, a lady between thirty and forty, suffered much from pain under the ribs of the right side, which was increased by pressure, and from headaches attended by great dejection of spirits, drowsiness, obstinate costiveness, and a diseased secretion from the internal surface of the intestines. The complaint in her bowels, and the diseased secretion from the surface of some part of the intestinal canal, seemed to ori- ginate from a strong purgative medicine which had been given to allay a febrile attack with which she was seized after lying in; it succeeded in removing the fever, but the secretion of her milk, which had been previously abundant, also ceaseil.

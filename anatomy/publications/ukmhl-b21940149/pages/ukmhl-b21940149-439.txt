or DYSENTERY. 391 Before concluding this section, it may not be improper to add, that, in phthisis pulmonalis, where purging occurs, the ulcera- tion of the mucous membrane of the intestines is perhaps caused by the formation of tubercles, which ultimately ulcerate. Of the. Symptoviis (^'Dysentery. Dysentery is a disease connected with the morbid appearances enumerated in the commencement of this section. Dysentery is a disease which is not peculiar to the human race, but is propagated even to the inferior animals, when very prevalent among men, at particular seasons. It has been much disputed whether it be propagated by contagion or not. Dr D. Monro, Sir J.Pringle, and Dr Cullen, are of opinion tliai it is contagious,—while many modem Navy and Army Sur- geons deny the existence of contagious dysentery. From what I have seen, I am disposetl to consider dysentery to be occa- sionally contagious, more especially in crowded hospitals. Dy- .sentery assumes various grades, being (Kcasionally mild, and easily removed; but at other times, as during autumn 18528, in Edinburgh, it is very prevalent and fatal; and, u{x;n dissec- tion, the larger intestines, and sometime's even the smaller, are found in an inflamed and ulcerated state. The severity of the symptoms dejK'nds u|xjn the extent of tlie inHammalion of tlie mucous membrane, which is very va- rious ; hence there is a great variety as to the severity of the symptoms of this disease. During infancy, it is generally milder than at a more advanced period o/ life. It is frequently conse- quent on diarrhoea and cholera. In this country, the disease is often accompanied by little lever, and is easily removed ; but, in other cases, it begins like typhus, which, in a short time, assumes the form of dysentery. The disease commences by coldness, shivering alternating with hot fits, uneasy and often painful sensations in every mem- • Vid. Meckel, extra Comment. Leipsick, tom. xv.

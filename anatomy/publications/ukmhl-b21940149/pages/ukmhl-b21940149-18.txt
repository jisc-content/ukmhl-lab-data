Xll INTRODUCTION. Disease is very frequently productive of remarkable alterations, by diminishing or enlarging the organ af- fected, and thus changing the relative situation of the diseased parts ; or uniting parts originally distinct, and forming pretematural communications. By a change of place or of bulk, in consequence of in- jury or disease of an organ, the functions of contiguous viscera may be deranged. T.hus, the pressure of the enlarged Liver disturbs the functions of the stomach; or by impeding the cir- culation of the blood through the bowels of the belly, produces dropsy. The enlarged Liver is the source of still farther mis- chief ; by pressing upon the gall ducts, it impedes the free passage of bile into the intestinal canal; and the bile, thus obstructed, is taken up by the lymphatic ves- sels, and occasions jaundice. Nor is this the only evil to be apprehended from the affection we are considering. By means of inflammation, the enlarged Liver may be united with the neighbouring parts ; and if, in such circumstances, an abscess should take place within it, the contents of the abscess might be discharged into the cavity of the peritoneum, into the sacs of the pleurae, or even into the lungs. The progress of the disease called a Rupture or Hernia, affords another and very striking example of the im- portance of the study of Morbid Anatomy ; for even the most accurate knowledge of the body in its sound state, conveys but an imperfect idea of the condition of the dis- placed bowels, or of the state of the canal through which they have been protruded. The displaced portion of intestine pushes before it the thin, slippery, and clastic peritoneum ; and, after

OF PUERPERAL PERITONITIS. 509 ration, while the peritoneum, detached from the supporting tis- sues, and sustained only by the skin, at length gives way, and forms an opening Peritonitis is often combined with puerpe- ral fever. Dr Dknman has mentioned cases which terminated favour- ably, in which the purulent matter was discharged by the ure- thra. Much valuable information on this disease is to be found in the works of Drs Aii.Msi aoNG, Leake, Hamilton, BunNs, Hulme, &c. OF THE CORRESPONDING SYMPTOMS. The symptoms of puerperal peritonitis are not essentially difie- rent from those of the ordinary peritonitis, but it sometimes be- gins without shivering. The disease is characterized by headach, oppression, great anxiety and prostration of strength, by flushing of the face, or sometimes by a pale ghastly countenance expressive of dejection of mind, and much boilily suffering, and even of despair. No- thing will stay on the stomach, nausea and vomiting are ex- cited even by the mildest food; and in the more advanced period of the disease, a dark coloured foetid fluid is rejected by vomiting, even though the Croats of the stomach be sound ; a general fulness generally precetles the pain of the belly, which begins low down in the region of the womb, and this is ac- companied frequently by a sense of bearing down, which I have observed even in virgins affected by {x>ritonitis. The tongue is pale, or rather white at first, but becomes brownish, and aphtha* appear in the mouth and throat. The pain in the belly is at first slight, but it soon increases, and sometimes is excessively acute, especially in the region of the womb, and it extends down to the thigh. The pulse, which had been at first full, becomes feeble. There is generally less thirst, less heat of skin, and less flushing of the face, than in common peritonitis. â€¢ Vide his Elements on General and Pathological Anatoniv. Edin. 1828.

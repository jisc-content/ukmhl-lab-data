138 SYMPTOMS OF INGUINAL HERNIA. hernia obliterated by an adliesion of its sides, in consequence of the use of a truss, and its body was filled by a watery fluid. Symptoms Inguinal Hernia. This disease, by attention to its origin and progress, may be distinguished from diseases of the testicle or cord. A tumour, possessing all the characters of hernia above enu- merated, appears in the under abdominal aperture. It is situa- ted above the ligament of Poupart, and frequently descends in front of the spermatic cord into the scrotum, and is then called a Scrotal Hernia, and the testicle may be felt behind and below the tumour. If the bowels have not penetrated beyond the under al)- dominal aperture, the tumour is small, circumscribed, is co- vered by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, and appears, according to Sir Astley Coopee, “ merely as a ful- ness above the ring and Poupart’s ligament,” its margin being undefined. If the tumour is nearer the pubes than common, and appears to have made its exit from the abdomen, immediately behind the under abdominal aperture, and if the spermatic cord can be perceived on the ilial side of the tumour, the case is a ventro- inguinal hernia. When a hernia is occasioned by external violence, it may be a ventro-inguinal hernia, though the spermatic cord and epigas- tric artery be situated on the pubal side of the tumour. The above circumstance is demonstrative of the greater safety of making the division of the stricture over the middle of the neck of the sac, as, in so doing, there is no risk of wounding the epi- gastric artery. Swellings in the groin, or in the scrotum, procc^eding from various causes, may sometimes bear a strong resemblance to in- guinal or scrotal hernia. 1st, Fat in the groin sometimes assumes the shape of an in- guinal or crural hernia, and being covered by a thin layer of

435 OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. within which they are lodged ; the colon is thus divided: the funffous tumours are of different sizes, some of them nearly as O large as small walnuts. Such fungous tumours, by obstructing the intestinal canal, occasion considerable dilatation above their seat. This disease is as common in the smaller as in the larger in- testines. The funeous ulceration is sometimes of considerable extent. There is a specimen in the Museum of the University, in which it occupies the larger share of the rectum. A funcrous state of the mucous coat is sometimes observed in cases where albuminous matter has been dejxisited between the coats of the stomach, and still more frequently in cases of .scirrhus, or cancer of the gullet, stomach, or intestinal canal *. A similarly diseased state of the mucous coat of the gullet gives rise to difficult deglutition, with a sense of pain in the part, which is much augmented during the effort of swallowing even the mildest substances, and there is occasionally a bloody mucus spit up. These excrescences, when of large size, ob- struct the gullet so much, that the patient in a short time dies of inanition. This disease, when in the stomacli, creates acute pain in the organ, with all the usual symptoms of indigestion, very frequent nausea, and vomiting occasionally of blood. The fungus of the mucous coat of the intestines produces painful distention of the bowels, purging, and discharge of blood along with the fseces. On account of the great dis- tention of the colon, and the size of the fungous tumours within it, as in the case from which Plate VII. of the former edition of this work was taken, the patient was supposed by my Father, at his first visit, to labour under a concretion within the colon. But on a more accurate examination, he was persuaded, from the softness and inequality of the surface of the tumour, Vide Plate IX. of former edition. E e 2

Thus hydatids, which are originally lodged within the liver, have often been discharged into the stomach or intes- tines, or externally upon the surface of the abdomen ; or hy- datids originally lodged within the lungs, have worked their way downwards, and been discharged at the navel; or they have got into the branches of the windpipe, and lx?en coughed up.

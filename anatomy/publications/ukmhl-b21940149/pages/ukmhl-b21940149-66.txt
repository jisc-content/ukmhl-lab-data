CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 32 affbrdctl was only just perceptible. I need not remark that this substance was insoluble in water. It appeared nearly as soluble in cold as in hot alcohol. A ley of potash dissolved it. It did not appear affected by muriatic acid, even hot; sulphuric acid dissolved it; a little sulphurous acid gas was evolved. The solution produced was of a bright-brown, by transmitted light, and of a dark-green, when viewed in the opposite direction. It effervesced with cold nitric acid, nitrous gas was disengaged, and a yellow solution formed, evaporated to dryness, yielded a yellow matter, insoluble in water, very soluble in alcohol, and without any peculiar taste. From these experiments, a conside- rable portion of resinous matter appears to exist in this concre- tion. “ The fibrous matter that remained, after the action of water and alcohol, was of a light-brown colour, and perfectly similar in its properties (comparative experiments being made) to the fibrous substance of the first concretion examined. “ 100 parts of this concretion may be said to be composetl of about 7.0 grs. Saline matter. 1.4 Brown faecal matter, 17.2 Resinous matter. 74.4 Fibrous matter. 100.0 “ No. 3.—This had an alvine smell, but no taste. “ It burnt with a bright flame without intermixing, afforded a smell of vegetable matter, and 10 grains yielded 5.0 grains of a light-grey ash. This ash was found to consist of phosphate of lime, with slight traces of carbonate of lime, and of a little si- licious sand. “ Twenty grains of the concretion were digested in water; the water ac(juired a slight yellow tint, and evajx)rated, gave very slight traces of the brown alvine matter. “ By digestion in alcohol, a solution of a light-greenish brown colour was formed, which evaj)orated, yielderl one-half grain of a

TElVirOHAllY SPASMODIC CONTRACTION 27C OF THE temporary SPASMODIC CONTRACTION OF THE INTESTINAL CANAL. A SPASMODIC contraction of the intestines is very frequent, and varies as to its seat, degree, extent, and duration. This spasmodic contraction constitutes the disease commonly called Colic, which in its more aggravated form has been called Ile%is^ or Iliac Passion. To enumerate the various causes of colic, is totally foreign to Uie object of this book : some of these have been described in the preceding pages, as extraneous bodies, worms, displace- ment, &EC. The earlier symptoms of colic are slight and occasional pain in the region of the navel, and which, in many cases, shifts its place, but at other times, is acute and fixed ; great anxiety, headache, acute pain in the region of the clavicle, in- termitting pulse, syncope; and even epilepsy has, in some cases, been consequent to distention of the colon, and, in some few cases, palpitation of the heart of several daysâ€™ duration. Ileus is accompained by still more acute pain of the abdo- men, especially in the region of the navel, by considerable distention, and generally by loathing of food, nausea, and vomit-- ing of bilious looking fluid, and often of faeces, and, on some occasions, even the clysters that have been administered have been rejected by vomiting. Colic, and its more acute form ileus, is sometimes unaccom- panied by fever, but there are many exceptions to this general observation. When, from any cause, the progress of the contents is impeded, the intestine becomes more or less distended, the distention be- gins near to the obstructing cause, and is at length propagated to the whole or greater part of the Intestinal tube. Ileus occasionally proves fatal, and very speedily so in some cases, from the mere distention of the bowels. Many years ago, I had occasion to examine the body of a lad of II years of age, who had been a patient of my father, who

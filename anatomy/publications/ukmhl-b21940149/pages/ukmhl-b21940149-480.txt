It seems to me prohahio, that the observations which Vic D’Azyh has made upon this subject :J; are well-grounded; hut 1 speak only From conjecture, as 1 have not seen in any anato- mical museum an example of this disease of the mucous coat of the alimentary canal. Such tumour.s, when within the .stomach, have been said to occasion pain in the region of the organ, nausea, vomiting, oh- .stinate constipation, and sometimes jaundice. A remarkable case of this description has been ile.scTihcd in the (ilst volume of the London Philosophical Tran.sactions, hy Dr P. IIani.y. Mrs R. jet. !i(). formerly ol'a healthy constitution, “ in the fifth month of her pregnancy, felt jin uncommon lump in her sto- mach, about the size of a hen’s egg.” This tumour occasioned nausea, vomiting, and emaciation.

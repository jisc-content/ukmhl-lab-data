Abscesses are more frequent in the rectum (especially on its external surface) than in any other part of the intestinal canal; as that bowel, from its positicm, functions, and connexion with the organs 'of urine and generation, is very liable to disease: thus the rectum sometimes is ulcerated from internal piles, con- dylomata, lumbar abscess, caries of the ossa coccygis, and dis- eases of the bladder and uterus. After an abscess of this kind has formed, the absorbent vessels are stimulated, and erosion follows; by which a communication is established between neighbouring parts of its parietes, that in some cases abridges, but in others prolongs life. Matter es- caping from the gullet into the windpipe, or from the stomach into the cavity of the peritoneum, generally proves fatal in a short time. But when in cases of obstructed pylorus the con- tents of the stomach pass directly into the colon, or when the contents of the bowels^ in strangulated hernia, are dischargetl by an artificial anus, in the former case life is prolonged, and in the latter, radical cure is sometimes effected. OF THE CONCOMITANT SYMPTOMS. The severity of the symptoms is generally projKirtioned to the extent of the suppuration. In addition to the symptoms above enumerated, which cha- racterize the formation of matter, as the pain diminishing, the pulse becoming slower and fuller, rigors, and sense of pulsa- tion subsiding, &c. these are symptoms which indicate the pre- cise situation of the abscess. When suppuration takes place in the pharynx or gullet, the patient breathes and swallows witli considerable difficulty and pain. Abscess in the stomach occasions loathing of food, sense of heat, fulness and weight in that organ, together with heartburn, pain, nausea and obstinate vomiting, and that which is vomited

2 general observations through which latter the refuse of the food is conveyed out of the body. The food is first minutely divided by the teeth, and mixed with the saliva and mucus of the moutli and throat; and is then propelled, by means of the muscular power of the pharynx and gullet, into the stomach, where it remains for a longer or shorter time. Owing to the particular figure, position and structure of the two orifices of the human stomach, the food is retained witli- in that organ, until it has been submitted for a sufficient time to the action of the gastric juice, by which it is transformed into a uniform pultaceous, greyish substance, called Chyme, which is gradually discharged through the pyloric orifice of the sto- mach into the Intestinal Canal. The human intestinal canal is about six times the length of the body, in order that the food may undergo the necessary changes ; that there may be sufficient space and time for the absorption of the more nutritious part of the chyme, by the lacteal vessels; and that the chyle which escapes one set of lacteals may be taken up by another, and be mixed sufficiently with the mucus, bile, and pancreatic liquor within the intestines, so that the process of digestion may be completed. The internal surface of the in- testine is much more extensive than the external, the inner coat being folded into doublings, which, from their resemblance to imperfect valves, have been named by anatomists Valvulas Con- niventes. Thus, the internal surface is extended, and more space is afforded for the absorption of the nutritious part of the aliment, and also for the action of those secreted fluids, which have a chemical effect upon the food. The length, diameter, and structure of the coats of the ali- mentary canal, and the manner in which its different parts communicate with each other, being more or less favourable to the exit or detention of the food, are by no means the same in different animals, but bear a relation to the kind of food on which they instinctively feed. Thus, the alimentary canal ot a graminivorous animal is not only much longer, but it is also much more capacious and complex, than that ot a carnivorous.

OF INTUS-SUSCEPTIO. 64 Mr Roweh gave me a portion of the ilium, measuring about fifteen inches, which had been discharged by stool. The pa- tient enjoyed good health for seven years afterwards. My father used to explain in his lectures the above very re- markable fact, by supposing a previous intus-susceptio, in which the stricture had strangulated the portion of intestine evacuated, and had occasioned a mortification at the upper part of the in- tus-suscepted portion, whilst, by exciting adhesive inflammation in the superior and inferior portion, ii had produced an adhe- sion of the superior with the inferior portion, and consequently a continuity of canal. For an account of another similar case, in which there w'ere several shreds and smaller pieces passed by the patient, I beg leave to refer the reader to vol. ii. art. 27. of the Edinburgh Med, and Phys. Essays, page 361. Of the Double Intus-Susceptio. This is a very rare form of the disease, and has not, as far as I know, been yet described. The late Mr A. Burns sent for my inspection a prepara- tion, illustrative of this disease, with the following description of it:— “ The case occurred in a boy of about twelve years of age. “ The caput coli, and transverse arch of the colon, were in- tro-suscepted into the sigmoid flexure of the colon and rectum. “ The peculiarity in this case consists in an inversion of the intro-suscepted portion, after it had slipped within the first fold. “ There is thus one intro-susception within another. “ All the inverted portion of intestine was highly inflamed in some places thickened by the coagulable lymph within its coats, and the part next the anus was gangrenous.”

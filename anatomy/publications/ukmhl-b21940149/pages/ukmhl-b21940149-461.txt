STOMACH AND INTESTINES. 413 ent of it, there being, at least apparently, no disease in this lat- ter organ. In several instances it has proved fatal; but, in others, and especially in two cases, which, I recollect, the com- plaint subsided for several months at a time, and the persons enjoyed in the interval tolerable health. This state continued many years, and the patients are still alive. In one case I had an opportunity of examining the condition of the stomach after death. It was very capacious, and was half-filled with this brown fluid, but it did not appear to be at all diseasetl in structure. The neighbouring viscera, as the liver and the spleen, were, as far as I recollect, perfectly sound. The fluid appears to be formed by a diseased secretion of the inner membrane of the stomach, without any apparent morbid struc- ture. This disease, according to my experience, is but very little influenced by medicine or by diet. In two or three cases, some benefit seemed to be derived from astringent medicines, combined with moderate doses of opium. As, for instance, from tincture of kino, or tincture of catechu, with a few drops of laudanum taken three or four times a day ; the bowels should be, at the same time, kept free from costiveness. In some cases, the stomach will lose almost entirely the power of digestion; the patients will become pale and emaciated, and appear as if they were affected by some fatal visceral disease ; at the same time no morbid structure in the region of ihe stomach or liver can be detected by the most attentive examination. In some of these cases, the patients have been completely restored to health by a course of the Bath waters Vide Dr Baillieâ€™s posthumous works, p. 190,191. Lond. 182s.

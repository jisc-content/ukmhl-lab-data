DISSECTION OF THE HERNIAL TUMOUR. 131 Dissection of the Hernial Tumour. The coverings of the tumour are, skin, cellular membrane, by some called a fascia, which is of various thickness, fascia pro- pria ot' Cami’EU ; and immediately investing the sac, the fascia infundibuliformis and the cremaster muscle. Camper has very faithfully represented the direction of the fibres of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, when there exists an inguinal hernia. When the tumour has attained a large size, the upper pillar is pushed upwards and forwards, and it forms a sort of band up)n the neck of the hernial sac In scrotal hernia of considerable duration, the fibres of the cre- master muscle attain a large size and rigidity, are spread over the neck and body of the sac, and may Ikj distinguished from the other coverings during the operation for a strangulatcxl hernia. There are some branches also of the external pudic artery lying over the hernial sac. Upon extending the incision to the under alxlominal aper- ture, the tendinous fibres which connect the larger tendinous columns of the external oblique muscle, generally are found to be of an unnatural thickness, and consisting of distinct layers, which adds much to the thickness of the sac. The under abdominal aperture is not only larger, but also of an unusual form. The small branches of the external pudic artery are found between tlie skin and hernial sac ; and these, as Camper has justly represented in his figures, attain, in hernia of some du- ration, an extraordinary size. The epigastric artery is at first situated behind the hernial sac, in the form of a curve, and then between it and ossa pubis, and is pushed nearer to the pubes, when the hernial tumour at--* tains a large size. The spermatic cord is commonly behind the hernial tumour, but sometimes, according to Le Dean, in front of it. The hernial tumour, even when the disease has been of many years’ duration, never extends below the place where the sper- I 2

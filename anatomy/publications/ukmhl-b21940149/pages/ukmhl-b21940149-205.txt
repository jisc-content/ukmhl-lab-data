OF CONGENITAL HERNIA OF THE MALE. 163 congenital hernia, which was communicated to me. About four years ago, a surgeon was desired to reduce a congenital hernia in a boy of six years old : he did so, but, along with the bowels, he pushed back the testicle into the abdomen ; and it has never since passed into the scrotum. It sometimes happens, that the congenital hernia is compli- cated with a hydrocele. In that particular case, the water col- lected within the vaginal coat, by change of posture, or, by pres- sure, readily returns into the cavity of the abdomen ; and it of- ten happens in young persons that the fluid is absorbed. OF THE VARIETIES OF CONGENITAL HERNIA. Mr Hky *, and Mr Foster-f*, have described an unusual variety of congenital hernia, in which the protruded bowels, with their containing sac, were included within the tunica vagi- nalis testis. This kind of hernia was probably occasionetl by the canal, through which the testes pass, being shut in its upper part, whilst its lower part remained open. OF CONGENITAL HERNIA OF THE FEMALE. In the observations on Crural Hernia, which I formerly pub- lished, I observed, that infants of the female sex may be afflict- ed with hernia congenita, as there is a canal formed by the peri- toneum, which passes through the Under Abdominal Aper- ture, over the round ligament of the uterus. This canal is about half an inch in length, and terminates in a blind sac at the groin. Ndck I is the first author who has described this canal; he called it a Diverticulum. Some authors had entertained doubts upon this point of anatomy, until Camper ยง and Wrisberg || examined the subject with attention. The latter has observed, that in 19 of 200 females, he found an opening generally on โข Vid. his Practical Observations. t Vid. Sir Astley Cooper, Part I. p. 59. $ Vid.

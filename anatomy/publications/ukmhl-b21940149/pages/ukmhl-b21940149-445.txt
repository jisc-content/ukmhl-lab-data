OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES. 397 were very much enlarged, where a congeries of them formed a ,( mass nearly equal in size to an orange. I “ A portion of the ileum, about a foot in length, was remark- ably tender, and could hardly be touched without the finger in- li juring it. The inside of the gut was covered with indurations, i tumours and ulcers.” The above disease seems to bear a strong resemblance to that I peculiar organic derangement of the bladder of urine, which has been described by Dr Gilchrist of Dumfries in the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays. The coats of the intestines, according to Mr Louis, have I been frequently reduced to a softened or pulpy stale, in conse- I quence of phthisis pulmonalis, and other chronic diseases. In consequence of the thickened and frequently pulpy state of the mucous membrane, the valvula* conniventes and villi are less apparent than in the sound intestine. In the former edition of this b(K)k, I gave it as my opinion that this pulpy state of the coats of the alimentary canal is often I connected with inflammation ; and it may be added, that the observations of Dr Alisov, appendetl to Dr Gairdver’s pa- per, which have been lately published, appear to aff'ord com- plete evidence of the accuracy of the opinion. OF THE SYMPTOMS. I i The coats of the stomach or intestines have been found in J this morbid state, without the existence of any well marked i symptom; and also when the patient had died from some other [ disease, of which a most striking specimen is preserved in the f Museum of the University. There were “ two large apertures in the stomach. The one next : the pylorus encircled, at its margins, by a defined elevation of a I scirrhous appearance. The other is recent, with ragged margins, ■ and seems to have been formed by the action of the secretions ot the organ. Around both, to a considerable extent, the mu-

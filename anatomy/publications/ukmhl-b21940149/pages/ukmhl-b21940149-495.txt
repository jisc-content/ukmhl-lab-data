OF MUCOUS MEMBRANES. 443 “ She died on the 27th of January 1811. “ Dissection.—By sawing through the inferior maxilla at the middle, and turning back the left half, after dividing its mus- cular connections, the tumour was fully exposed to view. It now appeared to fill the whole of the throat and pharynx. Its base was attached to the palatal plates of the palate lx>nes, to the left of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid, and the point of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where the eusta- chian tube issues. Its left side grew to the cheek, the gum, and tonsils, and sent a sharp process to occupy the space be- twixt the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. Its poste- rior surface was connected by cellular membrane, to the back of the pharynx. As it pas-sed the nostrils, it sent a process in- to each ; that into the left was bkxxly. Upon opening the cra- nium, the base of the tumour was observed to liave obliterated the extremity of the os petrosum and corresponding portion of the sphenoid bone, causing the dura mater over the cavernous sinus to be elevated as high as the clinoid processes. The left nervus trigeminus could not be trac«l after it pierced the dura mater. The hole which the tumour had made in the bones was roundish, with sharp and rough edges; and was large enough to admit the point of the forefinger. The tumour seemed to have no connection with the orbit. About an ounce of water was found in the ventricles of the brain. “ The tumour, at its attachments, was firm and almost car- tilaginous ; but its apex, which rested on the gullet, was soft and friable. The processes which were in the iKxstrils were as soft as brain.” SECTION XX. OF MELANOSIS OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES.

459 OF THE STOMACH. dent fiuctiiation of its contents may be perceived, by careful ex- amination. When vomiting takes place during the scirrhous state of the coats of the stomach, it is produced by the action of the abdo- minal muscles solely. Some patients also suffer more when they lie upon the left than upon the right side, as in the case from which Plate VI. was taken, and was probably owing to the pressure of the dis- eased cardia on the nerves. When the pylorus has become ulcerated, there is, in some cases, no nausea or vomiting, which is probably to be imputerl to the contents of the stomach passing readily into the duo- denum. The scirrhous pylorus sometimes attains such a bulk as to be a cause of jaundice. The following symptoms render it probable that the disease has arrived at the third or ulcerated stage. Hectic fever, great anxiety, excruciating burning pain in the region of the stomach, much increased on the taking of food. The matter discharged by vomiting has a very offensive smell, and is of a brown-black colour, like coffee-grounds. This brown co- lour is owing to an admixture of blood, which is derived from the small bloodvessels of the villous coat of the stomach, that have been eroded by the cancerous ulceration ; but it is neces- sary to add, that this dark coloui'ed vomiting occurs in other diseases of the mucous membrane of the stomach. In some cases, large quantities of coagulated blood and pieces of membrane have been vomitetl, probably in consequence of the erosion of a large vessel; the disease, however, generally proves fatal before it has extended so far as to ulcerate any of the large bloodvessels of the stomach. Some patients, however, survive the haemorrhage, and die rather from the repeated los.s of blood, than from the great expenditure of that fluid at any given time, and, in the case recorded*, 12 lb. were vomited in the space of two hours, and the patient recovered.

203 OF THE COATS OF HYDATIDS. The sac of a large hydatid is sometimes divided into com- partments, which serve to prevent the smaller hydatids, contain- ed within the opposite ends of the sac, from pressing upon each other. Of the Coats of Hydulids. The coats of hydatids are not of a uniform density, being much thicker in some than in others; and even in the same hy- datid, we generally observe some j)ortions of these coats of great- er density than others; so that in the same hydatiil, there is a difference as to transparency or opacity in the different |)arts of its coats. Hydatids have two coats, an outer and an inner, and the outer coat is considerably thicker than the inner. There are no fibres in the outer coal of a hydatid visible to the naked eye; yet the outer coat jKissesses the distinguishing character of a muscle, the power of contraction uj>on the appli- cation of a stimulus. The inner coat of the hydatid is very thin, semitran.s[>arent, soft, pulpy, and very tender, and in very large hydatids |>ossesseK a small share of elasticity. The interior surface is lubricated by a fluid, which renders it slippery to the touch. From the inner side of some of the larger hydatids, there arc several excrescences, which are made up of a congeries of very small hydatids, and the size of these bears a ratio to the size of the hydatid. These excrescences are retained in their situation by a very thin transparent membrane, which covers them. There is still another appearance which I have remarked, viz. a number of small cells formed by folds of the inner membrane of the large pregnant hydatid, containing the small ones. It has not yet been determined what is the proportion of hy_ datids which may be called pregnant. In some cases, the greater part of the inner coat is studded o\'er with these small excrescences, but in other instances there

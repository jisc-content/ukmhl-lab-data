OF THE PERITONEUM. 517 belly, which gradually increase, and also the debility. There is often oedema of one leg. The alvine evacuations are pale coloured ; and, occasionally, a tumour is perceptible in some part of the abdomen, but, in other cases, there is effusion into the cavity of the abdomen, and a distinct fluctuation to be per- ceived. If the patient be a female, the catamenia cease. When the disease has been of some duration, every kind of food creates great uneasiness; the patient suffering much from flatus, and sense of weight in the belly, and occasionally from acute pain, at length dies much emaciated. To the valuable works of Morgagni, Drs Baillie, and Baron ♦ of Gloucester, and of Dr Moncrieff of this city, the reader is referred for a more minute account of the nature and symptoms of tubercles of the peritoneum. SECTION VII. GANGRENE OF THE PERITONEUM. Serous membranes are occasionally the seat of gangrene, in consequence of very acute inflammation. This I have seen in the peritoneum, and also in the pleura, when the intestines or lungs were gangrenous. Gangrene of the intestines is not unfrequent in cases of stran- gulated hemise. The protruded portion of intestine acquires a black or dark- bro^^^l colour, loses its healthy texture, is flaccid, tears like a piece of wetted paper, is thickened, emits a foetid odour, and, owing to an effusion of blood beneath the peritoneum, this mem- brane may be readily detached. Gangrene may be mistaken for the dark-brown or purple co- lour, which a portion of strangulated intestine acquires, from the veins of the displaced part being gorged, and from the in- filtration of serum, tinged with blood, beneath the peritoneum. But, in this case, the surface of the displaced intestine is clear, smooth, of the healthy texture, and does not emit a foetid smell. • Vid. Baron on Tuberculous Accretion of Serous Membranes.

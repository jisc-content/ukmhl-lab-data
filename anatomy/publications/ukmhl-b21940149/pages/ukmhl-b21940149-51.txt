OF EXTRANEOUS BODIES. 17 human intestines than in the stomach ; but, in quadrupeds, they are more frequent in the stomach tlian the intestines. The following observations apply chiefly to the human alvine concretions, and are descriptive chiefly of the large collection of these which has been formed by my father. After having examined the above extensive collection, I con- sulted, from a desire of obtaining farther information on the subject, the works of the most eminent pathological authors, and subjoin the result of my researches; from \vhich it is evi- dent, either tlmt such concretions are much more frequently formed within tlie alimentary canal of the inhabitants of Scot- land, or that they have been overlooked by the medical authors of Holland, Prussia, Italy, France, Germany and England. The museum at Leyden, formed of the joint anatomical col- IcHitions of Rau, Albinus, Lkdkboer, Van Doeveren, and part of the museum of Ruysch, and of the numerous dissex;- tions of the j)u|)ils of that seminary of medical instruction, con- tains, according to Dr Edward Sandifort (who has jHiblished a description of it in two large folio volumes), only one speci- men of an alvine concretion, and that was found in the ilium. ipr Walter of Berlin has published, in three large cpiarto volumes, a descri[)tivo Catalogue of the Anatomical Museum which he sold to the King of Prus.sia, but has de.scribed only one case in which he met with an alvine concretion, “ qui inter membranam muscularem et nerveam ventriculi ha?sit.” Morgagni, who practisetl in Italy, has published, in his thirty-seventh letter, and twenty-fourth article, the histories of several calculi which he met with in the alimentary canal; but from his description of these, I am inclined to supjxjse that the greater pai't of them had been formexi originally within the gall bladder, or biliary ducts, and had passed afterwards into the in- testinal canal. He has described very accurately the external characters, and also the internal structure of biliai-y calculi. He observes, speaking of those calculi found in the intestinal canal, “ Interna substantia meros ostendebat circulos striis intersectosand in another passage he adds, “ Interius ex circumjectis stratis com- B

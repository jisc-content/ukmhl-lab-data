328 SWALLOWING SULPHURIC AND NITRIC ACIDS. out its whole extent, excepting a few pojnts near the cardia, where it exhibited a greenish or yellowish tinge. There were a few spots^'of a very bright red on the muscular coat. The pitric acid also produces sudden death. It communicates to the lips, throat, and a considerable portion of the alimentary canal an orange colour. There is a coating of a yellow sub- stance on the surface of the eesophagus, which is greasy to the touch, and seems to be formed of concrete albumen and the mucous membrane. The stomach towards the pylorus is more or less inflamed, and there is a net-work of vessels upon it, co- vered with black and clotted blood. Perforations are some- times observed in the stomach, and the pylorus is much con- tracted. The duodenum and jejunum are spotted with yellow. The peritoneum is often thickened, and a yellow fluid is dif- fused into the abdomen. Obfila has given a very interesting case, illustrating the ef- fects of sulphuric acid upon the human stomach. OF THK EFFECTS OF SWALLOWING THE CAUSTIC ALKALI. The caustic alkali in solution has sometimes been taken in- stead of aerated alkaline water. I had occasion to visit a gentleman who had sipped a small quantity of the aqua potassas; it created at the moment a burn- ing sensation in the lips and mouth, which was immediately fol- lowed by violent inflammation, and very considerable swelling of the lips, tongue and arches of the jralate, so that he could scarcely speak or swallow for three or four hours. When the caustic alkali is swallowed, it creates violent vomiu ing, of a bloody alkaline matter, which renders the syrup of violets green, and effervesces with acids. This is followcrl by very acute pain in the region of the stomach, and gripes: if the ]K)ta.ss be taken in a considerable quantity, it occasions death in a short time. A dog that had swallowed two drachms of the suhcaihonate of potass, died, according to Mr Onru.A,

OF THE PERITONEUM. .515 Cartilaginous excrescences from serous membranes are more rare. I subjoin a striking example of tubercles of the serous mem- branes of the head, thorax, and abdomen. February 23. 1823.—A. B. aet. 35. complains of pain in epigastrium, and difficult respiration, oppression about the breast, and oedema of the lower extremities. Has redness, desicca- tion, and slight swelling of scrotum, which is painful on pres- sure. Pulse 128. Tongue clean Appetite tolerable. Little thiist. Urine copious. Bowels loose. Has been indisposed during fourteen months; but had no medical aid till November last, at which time, he had all the symptoms of hepatitis, with violent itching over the whole body, attended with considerable weakness. These symptoms were partially removed by the use of mer- cury, the warm bath, and various external applications, viz. murias hydr., nitras hydr., sulphas potassae, &tc.; but having incautiously exposed himself to cold, the present complaints supervened. The patient died five weeks afterwards. Sectio cadaveric.—After the removal of the skull-cap, there appeared small tumours, about the middle of the longitm^nal sinus, one on each side: one of them made a corresponding de- pression in the intenial table of the cranium. The veins of the brain were very turgid. On elevating the dura matter, considerable effusion was ob- served between the arachnoid and pia mater, and about ^v of serum were removed from the ventricles. The substance of the brain was of a very light red colour, as also the plexus cho- roides. When the thorax was opened, a large quantity of serous fluid was found in each of its cavities, but more in the left than in the right; in all about lb. v. The pericardium contained about ^xx of the same fluid. On the anterior part of the mediastinum an enormous cartila- ginous mass was found, attached superiorly to the cartilages cf thefrst and second ribs, and to the frst bone of the sternum ; ad- K k 2

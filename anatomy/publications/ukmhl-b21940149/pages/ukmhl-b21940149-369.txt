OF THE alimentary CANaL. 321 In which l_yniph was ettused upon parts, that were green m one place, and of a deep lake colour in another. A mucous membrane, when inflamed, is, no doubt, quentlij red, bid not invariably so. The redness is in some places more intense, and forms small points, patches or streaks, which is produced by extravasated blood, or it assumes an ar- l)orescent appearance. If the inflammation be intense, the mucous membrane looks like a piece of red velvet, and has a rugous surface, from the enlargement of the mucous glands. The redness does not go oflF on pressure; there are red circles around the bases of the mucous glands, and in the centre of these there are little cavities, which are also red. In order to see these appearances distinctly, it is requisite to wash off the vitiated mucus, or coagulable lymph, which covers the inflamed mucous membrane, and to make use of a good jnagnifying glass. The veins under infliuned membrane are also conspicuous. If the mucous membrane of the gullet be the seat of inflam- mation, the cuticulai- lining is raised into little blisters, or aph- thae, and, upon removing these, the surface is found to be abraded. It is not unusual to observe the mucous membrane of the stomach of the phtlusical studded over, towards its pyloric ex- tremity, with a great number of small mucous glands of differ- ent sizes. The mucous membrane is at the same lime softened, thicker than usual, and of the bt^'-orangc colour of Mr P. Syme, in- termixed with tile-red and a slight shade of lake-red. The inflamed mucous membrane may be readily separated from the subjoined membrane, owing partly to the softening of the cellular membrane, and partly to the effusion of serum; hence the swelling or oedema of the affected part. By the more acute inflauuuatlon of the mucous membrane, it is reduced to a state like mucus, and is sometimes cast off, leaving the muscular fibres quite bare. The inflammation generally spreads from the mucous to the X

14G OF THE VARIETIES OF CRURAL HERNIA. inHanimatiun, by wliich it becomes thickened, and sometime* cartilaginous. Strangulation more readily lakes place in this than in any other hernia, and is often so perfect, that it acts like a tight li- gature, producing the rajful mortification of the protruded bowel. Hence, in a former work *, I observed that, in gene- ral, the difficulty and hazard of performing the operation for crural hernia, deter the surgeon from having recourse to this operation in due season. If the operation be postponed until a considerable degree of inflammation has affected the herniary sac, it will often be impracticable to reduce the bowels. Sir Astley Coopek’s opinion on this point is still more de- cided. After mentioning instances of the fatal effects of post- poning the operation, he has added, “ So strongly am I impres- sed with this belief, that if I were myself the subject of crural hernia, I should only try the effect of tobacco clysters, and if they did not succeed, would have the operation performed in twelve hours from the accession of the symptoms.” Diagnosis of Crural Hernia. The general symptoms of all kinds of hernia are nearly the same. On account of the very small size and flatness of the tumour in crural hernia, and laxity of the skin and fat, it is often very difficult, by pressure with the fingers, to discover the disease, or to ascertain the nature of the contents of the tumour. Ano- ther cause of difficulty is the vicinity of the tumour to the neighbouring lymphatic glands. A swelling of the inguinal lymphatic glands bears a very strong resemblance to a crural hernia which contains omentum. Ilesides, some of the smaller inguinal gland.s frequently cover the hernial tumour. In both the above cases, the hernial tu- mour has not its usual characters, elasticity and smoothness of surface. • Obiervallons on Crural Hernia, Eilinburgh, 1803.

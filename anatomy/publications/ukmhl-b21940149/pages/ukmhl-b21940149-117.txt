OF IRREDUCIBLE HERNIA. 83 Where the hernial tumour is unsupported, more of the in- testines, and more of the omentum, slip down : there have been instances, in which the greater part of the moveable bow'els has got into the hernial sac, which has been so large as to hang as low down as the patientâ€™s knees; the contents of the tumour can- not in these cases be returned into the abdomen. Such large hernise generally contain more or less of a watery fluid. Notwithstanding the slight pressure made by the enlarged apertures upon the bloodvessels of the protruded intestine, it proves an obstacle to the free return of the venous blcxxl; hence a serous fluid, amounting in some cases to two or three pounds, is effused into the hernial sac: this fluid adds much to the bulk and weight of the tumour. It may be necessary- to draw- off die fluid by a puncture. Hemia; of a large size frequently cannot be reduced : they are not immediately dangerous to those wiio are attentive to diet, regimen, and to the state of the liody, and who wear a suspen- sory bandage: they, however, prove the source of uneasinc.ss. The [wnis is sunk in the swelling, the skin is fretted and inflam- ed by the urine distilling along it; the patient is generally in- capable of copulation ; much bodily exertion is painful, and even dangerous, for it may change the form of the disease, and may lead to strangulation, by forcing dowm more of the bowels into the hernial sac; besides, the testicle has sometimes been ab- sorbed in conset^uence of the pressure of the displaced intestines upon it, and the protruded portion of intestine has occasionally been ruptured by external violence. Constipation and colic are the usual concomitants of irredu- cible hernia ; the exmtents of the intestines being propelled on- wards, solely by the muscular contraction of the coats of the protruded intestines, as the contraction of the abdominal muscles cannot materially promote their evacuation. The coats of the intestines having, in consequence of the retention of their con- tents, lost their tone, their functions are impaired ; hence the tumour, which had been in the morning comparatively smalt* and soft, becomes, after meals, hard, tense, and much larger ; F 2

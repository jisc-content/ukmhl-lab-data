This acute inflam- mation is often combined with gangrene, when boiling water from a kettle, or acrid poisons have been swallowed. The colour of the mucous membrane, in cases of acute gas- tritis, whether occasioned by caustic, acrid poisons, or other causes, is various in degree. In the milder cases slight redness only is seen. It is of a red, or dark-brown, or black colour, and may be easily detached in patches from the subjacent mem- branes. There is a little serum effused under the mucous coat, which is soft and pulpy; and, very frequently, it is detached, and leaves more or less extensive ulceration, which occasionally extends to the other coats, and is sometimes combined with gangrene, in the form of spots or patches. This inflammation is apt to become chronic, in which case the membrane is less red; it is thickened, more tenacious, and sometimes ulcerated, and the edges of the ulcers are tumid and everted. Inflammation of mucous membranes, according to Dr Cak- MiCHAEi, Smyth, often continues, “ without much increa.se, for a long time; so long indeed, that the disease liecomes a

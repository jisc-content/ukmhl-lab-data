CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 2S “ 3. Alcohol dissolved the peculiar brown matter, and some of the salts, but extracted nothing particular, “ 4. Potash ley separated the albumen, the brown matter, and perhaps some of the salts. 5. Muriatic acid separated a notable portion of phosphate of lime. “ 6. After the action of all these re-agents, there remained behind a peculiar substance, having the colour and texture of the calculus. Ten grains of calculus left 1,2 grains of this matter. It was very light, and had the appearance of cork, or rather of the peculiar fungus which is used on the continent for tinder, and which the French call Amadou. “ 7- The calculi consist essentially of alternate layers of this peculiar substance, and of phosphate of lime. Some- times the substances are intimately mixed, instead of being in alternate layers. The albumen and brown matter seem to serve as a cement. The other substances are in a small pro- portion. “ The crust on the outside of some of the calculi consists of phosphate of hme, mixed with a brown animal matter. “ In a few specimens I observed crystals of phosphate of am- monia and magnesia upon the outside crust of the calculi; but these appearances are uncommon. “ In two calculi, the phosphate of lime amounted to rather more than half the weight of the whole. In one specimen, the albumen separated was one twenty-seventh of the whole ; but I have reason to believe that a portion still remained. The quan- tity of common salt and sulphate of soda was small.” I also prevailed upon Dr John Davy, during his residence in Edinburgh, in the winter of 1814, to analyze several of the human intestinal concretions which had not been examined by Professor Thomson, and the following is the communication with which he then favoured me: “ No. 1.—This concretion, nearly of a spherical form, was covered with a very thin crust of light-brown earthy matter,

OF THE PARTS CONCERNED IN HERNIA. Ill Ml- Pott remarks, “ that the mere stricture made by the ten- don in the generality of lacerated ruptures, is not only a suffi- cient, but the primary, and indeed sole, cause of the symptoms, and of all the mischiefan opinion which may lead to the sup- position, that tendons are capable of contraction on the applica- tion of a stimtilus. Put as the tendinous column is immoveable, and therefore passive, if tlie size of the under abdoviinal aperture had been diminished by the spasmodic contraction of the external oblique muscle, this must have been felt by the patient, or by any one who examined it. The pressure is occasioned by more of the intestine or omen- tum being forced into the Under Abdominal Aperture, than can lie there, without being much compressed, and the mischief docs not result from the Aperture Itcing less, but from its contents being greater; for when the Iwiwels have been sud- denly ])rotruded, and where there is no pretiisposition to hernia, the tendinous columns of the Under Abdominal Aperture cannot receive the Itowel or Ixiwels which are out of the abdomen, without making great and dangerous pressure upon these. And in a rupture of some duration, even where the inguinal canal has been extended, and where an extraordinary portion of the intestines has, from any cause, been forced down, the strangu- lation is not occasioned by the spasmodic contraction of the tendinous columns of the external oblique muscle. The remedies that are usually employed with the greatest success for the cure of hemiae, afford an additional argument in favour of the above opinion. Supposing the strangulation to depend upon a contraction of i the tendinous fibres of the Under Inguinal Aperture, or of the I Crural Aperture, tlie application of cold water, vinegar, snow, ^ li or ice, instead of removing the disorder (which they certainly 4 sometimes do) should, by bringing on a greater degree of con- 1 traction in the Tendinous Apertures, render the disease still ii more obstinate ; whilst, on the other hand, warm fomentations, ‘ which induce relaxation, should always prove an antidote to the i disorder, whereas they do much more harm than good, for, by

157 OF UMBILICAL HERNIA. OF THE UMBILICAL HERNIA OF THE ADULT. Men are much less predisposed to this kind of hernia than women. Any cause which leads to the enlargement of the umbilical rin" may occasion an umbilical hernia, which sometimes shews itself after delivery, and sometimes after tapping, for dropsy of the belly ; or it proceeds from excessive corpulency, owing to the previous dilatation of the umbilical ring. The navel of many women protrudes even at an early pe- tiod of utero-gesiation. Pregnant women are peculiarly liable to suffer from this her- nia. The enlarged womb pushes upwards and forwartls the intes- tines against the parletes, and at the same time extends the um- bilical ring. “ If the woman,” says Professor Burns, “ have been former- ly subject to that disease (umbilical hernia), pregnancy tends to increase it; whilst, on the other hand, the intestines being soon raised up by the ascending uterus, inguinal and femoral hernia? are not apt to occur, or are even removed, if they for- merly existed.” This hernia often attains a very considerable size in women who are accustomed to bodily labour. I have seen it very large in women who carry fish to our market from a distance; and, where the tumour has attained a large size, it becomes pendulous, the navel forming the upper part of the tumour. This tumour, when of large size, proves a very great annoy- ance to the patient, especially when it hangs so far down as partially to cover the pudenda; and also when it becomes uf- cerated. Some have affirmed that the contents of the hernial tumour pass through the peritoneum, or that the umbilical hernia is a tr%ic rupture; an opinion which is grounded upon error. In this species of hernia, the sac is very thin, and often con- tracts a very intimate union with the adjacent cellular sub- stance, fat and skin, so that it is difficult to distinguish the one

EFFECTS OF HYDATIDS UPON 206 'Iâ€™lie external coat of hydatids has sometimes been converted into bone. I have several preparations, which afford a striking illustration of the manner in which bone is formed upon the coats and sac of hydatids. The o.ssification begins from a few central points upon the coats of the hydatid, and by subsequent depo- sitions, the pieces of bone gradually become larger and larger, so that at length a considerable mass of bone is formed. Of the manner in which ike Cysts of Hydatids are formed. The sac containing the hydatid seems to be formed in conse- quence of the irritation of the hydatid. In the same manner, w'here a large quantity of purulent mat- ter has been contained witbin the viscera, w^e generally observe a sac, provided with arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatics, as is obvious from the very varied contents of these different sacs, and the spontaneous removal or absorption of their contents. There arc also similar instances in the vegetable kingdom, as in the production of galls on the oak, &c. Of the Effects (f Hydatids upon the Orgayis which contain them. Hydatids which attain a considerable bulk, not only mechani- cally affect the organ within which they are lodged by their pressure, but, by the irritation which pressure gives, produce i still farther changes upon it. On account of the particular stimulus which hydatids as liv- ; ing animals give, the organ containing them, or to which they ) arc attached, undergoes still farther changc.s, in consequence of , an action excited ; which perhaps may not improperly be termed J specific : in proof of which, the organs w'ilhin which hydatids j arc contained, or to which they are attached, arc sooner, and to 0

CONTRACTION OR THE MUSCULAR FIBRES. 2.51 Third, That the contraction is various as to its extent, degree, id duration; and, when of long duration, is sometimes suc- ?ctled bv a permanent organic stricture. Fourth, That the partial degree of contraction in the hollow owels gives rise to different symptoms, according to the part fifected, jiroving, in some instances, fatal in a short space of me, as in the stomach and intestines; but, in other organs, fe may be continued, though the spasm lie in the middle of lie womb, or middle of the body of the bladder, and though liat spasmodic contraction be of considerable duration. Lastly, That the inordinate degrt-eof contraction which some- imes takes place in the canals for the foot! and the urine, may, n its earlier stages, frequently be- removed by antispasmotlic emedies. In the preceding pages, a general delineation of the facts and irguments in favour of the muscular structure, and muscular contractile power of the canals for the fo<xl and the urine, has jcen given. Though each of the arguments, singly considered, â€¢annot be said to be absolutely conclusive, yet, when taken collectively, they form a very strong, and, in my mind, perfect lody of evidence. With this light liefore us, we can readily account for the gradual and continuetl progress of the food and the urine, through their projier canals; and also for those jieculiarities and irregularities which occasionally occur, as to the ]iassage of the contents of these canals; and the keeping in view the influence of this muscular jxiwer, is, as it were, the master-key that un- locks every intricacy, and resolves every difficulty. Though local stimuli be the most frequent causes of the spastic (constriction of the muscular coat of the passages for the food, the bile, and the urine, yet a cause diametrically opposite, the want of the usual stimulus, sometimes produces the same effect. Thus the urethra has been, in the first place, contracted, and ultimately rendered impervious, when all the urine has for some time pas.sed through the canula of a trocar, which had been em-

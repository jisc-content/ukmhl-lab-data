OF AFVINE COXCRETrONS. 25 Effects of Alvhie Concretions upon the Alimentary Canal. I. Such alvinc concretions as have been detained for years within the alimentary canal, become gradually larger, and can- not be moved from one part of the intestines to another. They then disturb the functions of the alimentary canal, prove a source of great irritation, by interrupting the progress of the fa’ces, and frequently occasion an enlargement of the intestines, which is sometimes followed by inflammation. II. In more favourable circumstances, the coats of the intes- tines are expanded into a sac, which lodges the concretion; and, in process of time, the sac acquires considerable thickness. There arc in the museum of the University three specimens, in which the caput ca*cum coli has bi'en much extended. In one of these, the muscular fibres, towards the ilio-ca'cal valve, had attained an unusual size, and the mucous membrane lining the sac was thickened and corrugatetl. The colon communicates with the cacum by a circular opening, nearly an inch in diame- ter. In a second specimen, the cavity in which the concretion was lodged seems to be formetl by the extension of the extremi- ty of the ileum, and the mucous membrane of that intestine has lost its villous surface. The right colon communicates with the caput caecum by an aperture about a quarter of an inch in di- ameter. III. As alvine concretions arc a source of much irritation, we sometimes find the organ which contains the extraneous body contracted upon it. “ Ventriculum valde parvuni rugosum, extrinsecus plicis refertum atque veluti contractum,” says Schenk *. IV. Stricture of the intestine is another effect of the irritation occasioned by an alvine concretion. V. Intestinal concretions have been said sometimes to adhere to the inner coat of the intestinal canal -f*. • Vid. Lib. iiL t "Vid. Horstii Observ. 381.

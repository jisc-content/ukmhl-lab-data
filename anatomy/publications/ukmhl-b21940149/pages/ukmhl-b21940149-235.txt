Habitat in Britannia infrequens. t It lias often been a matter of surprise to find this species con- sidered ns Tmnia lata of Linke, when he expressly says, both in Fauna Suecica, and in the twelfth e<lition of the Sys- tema Naturae, ‘ Ta;nia lata osculis lateralibus solitariis.’ He has referred to some figures, which references are possibly wrong; hence, probably, the confusion, which too frequent- ly hajjpejis; for when jdates are given or referretl to, the descriptions are forgotten.” I do not projX)sc to follow the arrangement of any of tlie au- thors ; but merely to 'give such general remarks on intestinal vermes as my own ex{>erieiK‘e and observation furnish. IVENIA. It may be proper to make .some general remarks on the ana- tomical structure of this genus, which, although chiefly drawn from the examination of Tienia solium, may be considered as applicable to all the species. Tape-worms arc covered by an clastic and porous membrane,, which, when examined by a microscope, seems smcai-ctl with a tenacious liquid, which exudes through jx)vcs. Under the membrane, some scattered fibres of a white co- lour are seen, the external of which are fixed into the inferior margin of each joint, and are disposed in a longitudinal man- ner ; the inner set of fibres following a transverse course. The alimentary canal, which takes its rise from the mouth, divides into two distinct canals, w'hich pass along the margins of the joints ; and in the last joint these canals arc impervious. Besides these longitudinal marginal tubes, there are trans-

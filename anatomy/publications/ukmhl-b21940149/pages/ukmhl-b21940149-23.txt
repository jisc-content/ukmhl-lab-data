INTIIODUCTION. XV11 111 the University of Edinburgh, the importance of Morbid Anatomy to the liberal and scientific study of medicine, has always been sensibly felt; and both my Guandfather and Father endeavoured, as far as their other duties allowed, to introduce the most promi- nent features of that science into their lectures on Ana- tomy, Physiology, and Surgery. But in a course of Medical Instruction, comprehending so wide a field of inquiry as hail been assignetl to their charge, even though the term of lecturing extended to six months, it may easily be supposed, that only a small portion of time could be appropriated to a branch of the subject still overlooked or undervalued, and but too generally left, in the hurry for obtaining what was erroneously conceivetl to be more essential information, to the research and experience of a more advanced period of life. The opinions of professional men are now more enlarg- ed ; and this department has become so interesting, and promises such valuable and extensive assistance to the healing art, that it can be treated with complete success only when it is converted into a distinct object of study. These considerations, strongly impressed on my mind by the practice of my predecessors, and by the general current of medical opinion, induced me to deliver a sepa- rate course of Lectures on Morbid Anatomy, and to prepare the materials of the follo^^'ing Work. My situation in the University naturally led me to bestow the most ^^gilant attention on the progress of anatomical knowledge, and its useful applications in the details of practice. These I was anxious to extend, and many local advantages favoured my design ; for in addition to the opportunities obtained by private dis- section, our Infirmary and Dispensary afforded me va-

112 OF THF ANATOMY rarlfying the air within the protruded intestine, they add to the bulk of the tumour, and aggravate the disease. Where the bowels are strangulated at the Navel, or at the Under Abdominal Aperture, it seems to me to be owing to the bowels within the hernial sac being stretched, twisted, and inflamed, and forced into a part where there is no sufficient cavity for their reception, and to their bulk being increased by an effusion of lymph upon their surface, between their coats, or within their cavity. ^th. That the strangulation at the Upper Abdominal Aper- ture may be occasioned either by the fascia of the transverse muscle, or by a spasmodic contraction of the internal oblique muscles. If it is occasioned by the latter, it may be removed by those remedies which occasion great relaxation, as vene- section, fomentations, or the warm bath; whereas, if a tendon be the seat of the strangulation, such applications }>roduce no good effect, tendons being incapable of relaxation or con- traction. \Oth, That the situation of the Under Abdominal Aperture is not exactly uniform, owing to the existence of some slight difference as to the place of the separation of the tendinous columns which border that aperture. Hence the tumour in an inguinal hernia has not always precisely the same situation ; and if the smaller tendinous fibres which unite the larger ten- dinous columns be awanting, though the hernial tumour be truly a protrusion through the inguinal canal, it may have the same situation as a crural hernia. IH/t, That, when the bowels are protruded through the in- guinal canal, and pass in front of the .spermatic cord, these are di- rected obliquely downwards and inwards, in which situation they are covered by the cremaster muscle, and the membrane derived from the tendon of the external oblique muscle, which has been called the Superficial Fascia.

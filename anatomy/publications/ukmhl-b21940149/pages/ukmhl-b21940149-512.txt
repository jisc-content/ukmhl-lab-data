OF SCIIUIHUS AND CANCER 460 The following case affords a good illustration of the preced- ing remarks:— A man, 57 years of age, who had been for many years sub- ject to stomach complaints, fell down in a state of insensibility. Upon recovery, he discharged, by vomiting, a quantity of blood, and also passed clotted blood by stool for some weeks. In about six months, the vomiting returned, and with in- creased severity ; at last, after having suffered in the course of one night six successive fainting-fits, followed by vomiting of blood, he suddenly expired. On examining his body, several coagula, and about 2 lb. of fluid blood were found within the stomach. The orifice, or orifices, from which the blood had been dis- ; charged, could not be discovered. An extensive cancerous ulcer occupied the whole of the left sac of the stomach. In this disease, owing to the small quantity of food which passes the pylorus, the discharge by stool is very trifling, and somewhat resembles the meconium of infants. Clysters are generally required to procure a passage, and of- : ten even the most drastic purgatives. j After the disease has arrived at its third stage, every kind of j food except milk, gruel, soups, jelly, or sago, aggravates the i very acute pain in the stomach. I visited a patient in this state, who could take nothing else than tapioca, during the lat- ^ ter weeks of his life ; and there are some who reject almost in- stantly every kind of food. From the duration of the disease great emaciation and weak- ness follow. The vomiting commonly ceases a few days before the pa- tient’s death. The pulse, towards the conclusion of the disease, is generally from 96'’ to 100% or 110% and very weak, and small. There is much variety as to the severity of the symptoms ’ and the progress of this disease, and also as to the pain the pa- tient suflers. In some instances the appetite is good, the bowels

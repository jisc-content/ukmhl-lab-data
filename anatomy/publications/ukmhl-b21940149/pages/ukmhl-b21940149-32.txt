Were I to state my own sentiments, the importance of Morbid Anatomy might appear overrated. I shall, there- fore, adopt those of my much esteemed friend Dr Wii.- soN Philip, whose researches have thrown so much light upon the function of Digestion. “ No arguments,” says he, “ are necessary to convince us of' the importance of that function, on which all the parts of our frame depend for their nourishment. In one respect, its organs may he regarded as of greater im- portance than even those w'hich are more essential to life. “ The sympathies of the stomach and first intestine are both more powerful and more extensive than those of any other part, and consequently more generally, and in a greater number of ways contribute to the cause, and influence the course, of all our more serious dis- eases'^.” A great number of singularly illustrative cases wdll be found in the following pages. To this kind of information it has been objected that it adds more to the bulk than to the value of a book. It has been attempted to obviate this objection, by giving only the more prominent features. In preparing this edition, I have received much use- ful assistance from my medical colleagues and friends, for whose valuable communications, and the honour they have done me, I feel sincerely grateful. • riiil.

INTRODUCTION. XX mit of generalization, particular illustrations seem super- fluous, but where a diseased appearance is singular, or un- common, it then becomes necessary to enter into a fuller detail, by an insertion of particidar cases: for these, as Mr Abernethy has justly observed, â€œ will probably convey more information in less words than description or narrative, as they identify the kind of disease which is meant to be described, and inform as it were by ex- ample The arrangement which I have adopted differs a little from that of preceding authors; for, instead of describing in continuance all the organic derangements of the Gullet, of the Stomach, or of tlie Intestines, I have classed under one head the same diseases in these differ- ent parts of the alimentary canal. While this plan precludes unnecessary repetition, it seems to me to give more clear and precise ideas on the subject, serving farther to point out the distinction be- tween the anomalous and the characteristic symptoms of the disease. To the description of the morbid aj)pcarances, a brief enumeration of the concomitant sym])toms is subjoined. This is a very interesting, but a very difficult branch of the subject. It would constitute the perfection of medical science, were we capable of deciding, in particular cases, what changes have taken place in the living body; for on such a decision, a correct diagnosis would be established, speculative opinions would be converted into demon- strative evidence, and a foundation truly rational laid, for regulating the details of medical practice. In con- firmation of these sentiments, it is justly stated in the * Vide hiH Classification of 1 umours, p. 23. 1

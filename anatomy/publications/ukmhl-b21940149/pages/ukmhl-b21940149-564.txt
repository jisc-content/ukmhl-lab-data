508 OF PUEllPERAL PERITONITIS. Wlien an inflamc?d serous membrane is covered with flbrine, the pus is derived from the vessels of the inflamed membrane, but when the flbrine forms an organised false membrane, as in chronic pleuritis or in chronic peritonitis, pus is secreted by the vessels of the new membrane only. The sero-purulent fluid or pus is contained in a distinct sac, as was long ago observed by Morgagni, Epist. 34. OF THE PUEIIPERAT. PERITONITIS. Besides the more frequent species of jieritonitis, which is common to both sexes, there is a variety of the disease which is modified by the puerperal state, and which sometimes occurs soon after delivery, from exposure to cold, violence during de- livery, or the use of stimulants. It often affects the peritoneum of the ovarium and Fallopian tubes, which is rendered opaque, thickened, and loses its glis- tening appearance; and, upon certain portions of the inflamed membrane, there are red spots of different sizes, together with an effusion of more or less flbrine. A quantity of purulent or sero-purulent fluid is frequently found between the bladder and womb, or between the womb and rectum ; and it sometimes hapjiens that the flbrine forms a cyst, which is fllled by pus. In the more severe cases, the inflammation extends over the whole of the peritoneal covering of the intestines, and sometimes even to that portion of (he peritoneum that lines the parietesof the abdomen. In a few instances, a suppuration is observed in the veins of the womb by the late Mr Wn.soN *. When this disease has passed its acute stage, purulent mat- ter, in some instances, is discharged at the navel. Accord- ing to that excellent pathologist Dr Craigik, “ this opening is effected, first, by distention, the pressure of the matter sepa- rating the recti, and enlarging the umbilical afterwards by lace- • Vid.

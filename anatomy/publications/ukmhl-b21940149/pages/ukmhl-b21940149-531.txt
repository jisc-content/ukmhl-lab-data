OF THE RECTUM. 475 SECTION XXIV. OF HiEMORRHOIDS, OR PILES. H/EMOKtiHoiDS, or pUes, are fleshy-like tumours, which vary in size, and are situated within the sphincter ani; or at or near to the verge of the anus, and hence they have commonly been divided into two classes, the external and internal. These tu- mours are of three kinds, essentially different in structure, the one is a dense, though somewhat compressible tumour, that con- sists chiefly of compact cellular substance, and contains a few cells, some of about the size of a pea, which are filled with mucus or blood. The size and colour of this kind of pile are by no means uni- form, being sometimes about the size of an olive, and frequent- ly smaller, of a brown or reddish colour; but others arc larger, have a transpiu*ent appearance, and, when pressed, arc elastic, like sponge, and of a pale colour. A second kind of pile, according to Richter, is formal of blood extravasated under the mucous coat of the intestinum rectum, and tlie cyst is composed of the mucous coat; and, in proof that this is the nature of the disease, the tumour is sometimes as large as an apple; and even when it is cut off', there is no hsemorrhage, a proof that it is not caused by a varicose vein; besides, the tumour is sometimes nearly flaccid. There is a third kind of pile, which is formed by varix of the veins. Mr Kirby, who has devoted much attention to this subject, affirms, that he found piles formed of a varicose disten- tion of the great haeniorrhoidal vein : the tumour appeared to be composed of the cellular substance in a state of unusual firm- ness, surrounded by veins, and covered by the integuments. The veins were branches of the internal iliacs *. The veins of the villous coat of the lower part of the ali- mentary canal more frequently become varicxise than those of â€¢ l ide Kirby, on certain Severe Forms of Haetnorrhoidal Excrescences, p. 40.

81 OF CHRONIC HERNIA. aperture in the parietes, in consequence of a very slight occa- sional cause, as by turning in bed; the situation of the tu- mour, and sensations it communicates, proclaim the nature of the disease. Before the bowels descend, the patient has a sense of fulness, tension, or weakness in the groin, when in the erect posture, and especially upon taking exercise, or coughing. In a short time, after some slight exertion, a small tumour shews itself. The tumour is not painful, even when pressed, and sometimes creates so little uneasiness, as not to attract the attention of the patient, until it has acquired a considerable bulk. Chronic Herniae are reducible or irreducible, and occasion- ally strangulated. The size and figure of the tumour are by no means uniform, even in the same species of Hernia, owing to the kind of bowel included within the sac, peculiarity of constitution, and the pos- ture of the patient, for it swells out in the erect, and diminishes in the recumbent jx)sturc, disapjx'ars on pressure, and enlarges upon the pressure In'ing removed, after long standing, or after a full meal, or when air is generated in consequence of indiges- tion. By a minute examination, and by attention to the symptoms, the contents of the tumour may generally be discovered, pro- viding it be not very small, hard and tense, and the patient very fat. A hernia filled by a portion of intestine is generally soft to the touch, elastic, and compressible, and, when compressed, feels somewhat flabby, the displaced bowel being commonly filial by air; and when the patient coughs, it communicates a sensible impulse to the hand, and a gurgling noise may be heard when the intestines slip back into the abdomen, and the hernial sac then feels empty. But when la?ces are within the displaced portion of intestine, the tumour is, when pressed, like to that occasioned by a proÂ» trusion of the omentum. The omentum being very moveable, unattached at its lower

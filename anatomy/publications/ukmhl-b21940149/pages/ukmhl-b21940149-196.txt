( ) EXOMPHALOS, OR UMBILICAL HERNIA. Bv this terra is to be understood a protrusion at the navel, or at the side of it, of some of the abdominal bowels. This disorder may occur at any period of life. Frequently it has been observed in the foetus in utero, or it shews itself at or soon after birth, and also in after life, especially amongst women who are pregnant. There are certain peculiarities proper to the disease in these three different states of life, which merit notice. The first, or congenital hernia, is connected with the mode of formation of the parietes of the abdomen, which have been so minutely and accurately described by Scakpa as to render repetition superfluous. I shall content myself by stating, that the parietes of the abdo- men of the foetus are lined, as in the adult, by the perito- neum ; and if the navel string be drawn outwards, a slight de- pression in that membrane may be observed opposite to it; and it is evident, by placing the finger on this depression, that it is the least resisting portion of the parietes of the abdomen. According to the very accurate Sokmmkrikg, the bowels are protruded at the upper part of the umbilical ring ♦, close to the umbilical vein. The tumour, which seems as if formed by the expansion of that part of the navel string next to the child’s body, is not of a regular figure, and is very various as to size, as the umbilicus does not yield in an uniform manner. The navel rupture of the foetus is sometimes a tumour of considerable bulk, and contains a considerable portion of the intestines; and, in these circumstances, the abdomen, according to Professor Burns, is too small to receive the intestine quickly. The child generally dies in a short time. In one case, ac- • Uber Ur.'uchc iind Vchulunj? ilir Niibcl.

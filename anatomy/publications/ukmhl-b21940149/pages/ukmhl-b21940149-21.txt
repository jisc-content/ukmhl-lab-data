INTRODUCTION. XV surgeons who have not acquired, by the study of Mor- bid Anatomy, an accurate idea of its nature and pro- gress. “ For want of some criterion,” lie observes, “ to guide our judgment in the investigation of diseases, we too often mistake the occasional symptoms for the disease itself; w'hich, from the obscurity of its situation, or its apparent insignificance, is totally neglectetl. “ Practitioners who are not in the habit of investigat- ing diseases, but are satisfied with treating the symji- toms which present themselves, are naturally very often led into this error. “ The constitutional symjitoms,” he adds, “ which be- long to a Stricture of the Urethra, have been more fre- quently mistaken for an original tliscasc, than those of any other local complaint In short, the knowledge of Morbid Anatomy con- tributes essentially to solve the above, and many other difficulties, which occur daily in judging of the origin, progress, symptoms, and treatment of this great class of organic diseases. By comparing the internal organization of different animals, wt are enabled to distinguish those parts which are common in the structure, and essentially necessary for the perfonnance of the vital functions, from such as are pecidiar to certain animals only, and exclusively subservient to their economy and habits of life. There are certain bowels on which life more im- mediately depends, and which, with great propriety, have been termed Vital. There are others, which, though highly useful to the animal, are not absolutely necessary to the prolongation of life. • Vid. Practical Observations on Strictures, Vol. ii. p. 14.

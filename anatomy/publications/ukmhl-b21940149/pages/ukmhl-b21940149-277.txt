229 OF INTESTINAL WORMS. 3. Ascaris Conosoma. 4. Cercosoma. 5. Hexathryclium venaruni. 6. Hydrometra hydatica. 7. Diacanthos polycephalus. lieforc concluding thi.s branch of the subject, it seems neces- sary to add, that substances, like bloodvessels with their branches, have been frequently passed by stool, and have lieen frequently mistaken for worms. EXPLANATION OF PLATE IV. In this large Engraving, rejjresentations are given of the greater number of worms described in the preceding pages, and the names of the w'orms have been put upon the engraving. Theie is only one of the figures which seems to require a more par- ticular explanation,â€”that shewing the mode of multiplication of hyda- tids, which takes place by the accretion of very small hydatids to very minute cells witlnn the larger hydatid. The parent hydatid is lodged within tl>e distinct cyst A, the inter- nal surface of which is directly applied to the outer surface of the hy- datid ; but tliere is no direct connection between these by the medium of bloodvessels and nerves. The outer surface, B, of the hydatid is smooth. The hydatid has two coats of unequal thickness, the innermost being much thinner than the outermost, which latter possesses a considerable share of elasticity, and curls up when tom. The innermost coat is a very delicate membrane, and is gathered up so'as to form a number of small cells, C, C, in wliich the smaller 4iy- datids, which are collected into small clusters, D, are for a time lod- ged, but after^vards aie detached from the parent hydatid. The figure above shews that each of the hydatida, after it has at- tained a certain size, becomes in its turn a parent hydatid. 1 hese figures of hydatids were taken from drawings, made for me4& in the year 1800, by Mr Clift, Conservator of the Museuna of the Royal College of Smgeons of London.

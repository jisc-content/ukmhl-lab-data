OF THE ME1)UI,1,A11V SARCOMA. â€¢13() the almost constant pain, the great discharges of blood and pus by stool, and the emaciation of the patient, that there was a fungous excrescence of the mucous coat of the colon. Such fungous tumours may frequently be traced to chronic inflammation of the membrane ; and they are also the effect of organic diseases, as cancer, in progress to a fatal termination. SECTION XJX. OF MEDULLARY SARCOMA OF THE MUCOUS MEM- BRANE OF THE STOMACH. This tumour has been described by that very distinguished surgeon Mr Abernethy, as appearing sometimes externally. I have met with several instances of this disease, in two of which (as in the specimen from which Plate VI. was taken), there were tumours somewhat of a similar description in the sub- stance, and also on the surface, of the liver, which was very much enlarged. The lymphatic glands in the vicinity were con- siderably enlarged and indurated. This tumour is of a pulpy consistence, and a part of the pulp seems to be soluble in wa- ter. This disease, which, at the time of the first publication of this work, was not generally known to the profession, may probably be illustrated more clearly by cases than by any description or narrative. I subjoin the histories of those which arc contained in the Anatomical Museum of the Uni- versity. In case first, there is, at the cardiac extremity of the stomach, an extensive lobulatcd tumour of a mcdullo-sarcomatous nature, the lobes of which arc covered with a delicate mucous membrane.

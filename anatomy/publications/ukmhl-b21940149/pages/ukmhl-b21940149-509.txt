457 OF THE STOMACH. OF SCIllllHUS AND CANCER OF THE STOMACH. Scirrhus and cancer are more frequent in the stomach than in the gullet, and are partial or general, and sometimes com- bined with similar diseases of the gullet, or of the colon, which adheres firmly to the stomach. The capacity of the stomach is commonly much diminished by scirrhus affecting the body of the organ, its coats being much thickened, and sometimes a scirrhous tumour projects into its cavity. I measured the quantity of water such a stomach would hold, and found that it was capable of containing little more than four ounces. The pylorus is a more frequent seat of cancer than the body of the stomach, or the cardia; and the disease, when much ad- vanced, by obstructing the progress of the aliment, occasions an enlargement of the stomach, which, on account of its increased size and weight, when filled, descends in many cases lower than in the healthy state; in some cases it preserves its transverse position in the abdomen, but in others, the cardia retails its na- tural situation, whilst the pylorus sinks as low as the navel, and may be distinguished there during the life of the (latient; and, when in that unusual situation, it has, on account of its hard- ness and mobility, been mistaken for scirrhus of the colon, an intestinal concretion within the intestine, a tumour in the omen- tum, or an enlarged mesenteric gland. The distended stomach is sometimes connected with the pan- creas ; and, in one case, communicated with a cavity in the pancreas *. A scirrhous contraction of the pylorus is often accompanied with ulceration, and perforation of the mucous membrane of the stomach, and often, also, with scirrhous thickening of the pyloric portion of the stomach. In a specimen of this description in the Museum, the pylorus is much contracted, and there is internally a fungous tumour ; â€¢ Vide Printed Catalogue of the .iVnatomical Museum of the University. 3

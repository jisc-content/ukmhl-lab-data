474 SYMPTOMS OF SCIRIIHUS AND CANCER Besides, piles liave generally narrow necks, but scirrhous tumours, and also venereal verrucae, when in the rectum, have broad bases ; and further, the verrucae give little pain, and not only grow from the rectum, but also from the skin around the anus. In short, the pathognomic symptoms of scirrhous rectum are: Distention of the larger bowels, tenesmus, pain and diffi- culty in the evacuation of the faeces, which are scanty, and dis- charged, only after a considerable effort, in a flattened form, or liquid state, and accompanied with a burning sensation in the part affected, and the discharge of a foetid, ichorous fluid, of blood, or of ill-conditioned pus. The stricture caused by scirrhus is, in some instances, destroyed by ulceration, and a passage is fre- quently formed between the rectum and the bladder, or some- times between the rectum and vagina.

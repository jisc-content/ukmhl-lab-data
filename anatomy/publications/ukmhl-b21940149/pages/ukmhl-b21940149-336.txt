288 OF PALSV OF THF AUMENTAUY CANAL. SECTION V .. OF PALSY OF THE ALIMENTAKY CANAL. The food passes through the alimentary canal by means of the combined action of the muscles of respiration, and that of its proper muscular coats: which serves to mix its various parts, to expose them to the orifices of the absorbent vessels arising from the very extensive surface of that long tube, and there- by contributes materially to chymification and chylification. The food is propelled onwards by the contractile power of the coats of the stomach and intestines, and by the contraction of the abdominal muscles, which is as essential to the due per- formance of the functions of the alimentary canal, as the neces- sary quantity and quality of the fluids derived from its mu- cous coat, or from the liver and pancreas, or the due action of the nerves. These muscular agents, however, on some occasions, do not act in concert. It is evident that one of them alone is inadequate to the purpose; hence distention and the loss of power of the coats of the intestine occur in hernia, as the contraction of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm are inadequate to push on- wards the contents of the displaced intestine. The same effect takes place from the relaxation consequent to tapping for the dropsy of the belly, or from organic disorders of the spinal cord. If the imperfect action of the muscular coat of the stomach impedes chymification, and that of the intestinal tube cJjylifica- tion, a morbid irritability, which often is consequent to a ccr- taiji degree of inflammation of the mucous membrane, occasions the rejection of the ingesta by vomiting, or their tex) speedy transit into the duodenum. Such unchymified alimentary mat- ter stimulates the mucous membrane of the intestines, so as to produce in it the same irritability as existed in that of the sto-

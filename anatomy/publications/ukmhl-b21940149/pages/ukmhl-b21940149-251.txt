207 THE ORGASMS AVHICII CONTAIN THEM. a much greater degree affected, than by the ordinary fixed drop- sical cysts, whether of the natural or preternatural kind. Thus a large quantity of water accumulated in the ventricles of the brain in hyilrocephalus internus, sometimes occasions, in an Infant, a disunion of the bones of the cranium from each other, and the head attains an unnatural bidk. No part of the cranium becomes soft, thin, or is absorbed; but if hydatids are lotlged in one of the ventricles of the brain (which is not uncommon in sheep), the cranium over that ven- tricle becomes soft, and may be cut without turning the edge of the knife, and loses considerably of its thickness. In some cases, holes are formed in it, although the dura mater remains entire between the cranium and the brain, and even although the cyst containing the hydatids is still covered by a seemingly sound portion of the brain and pia mater. The same hap^wns in the human body ; for, in the first cjise stated, where a hydatid of the size of a goose’s egg wa.s found in the right ventricle of the brain of a man, covered by a gelatinous matter, without any fibrous adhesion to the membrane lining the ventricle, the cranium was found to be much thinner on it.s right side than on the left, and in particular the right parietal bone was not thicker than a wafer. In like manner, the pleura, pcritona’um, and vaginal coat of the testis have been greatly extended for a length of time, but the containing membrane continued entire ; whereas, when hy- datids are collected within these membranes, a slight degree of inflammation is excited ; this is followed by adhesions ; the cyst containing the hydatids is destroyed, by which the hydatid escapes from its original situation. There is a much greater disposition to the destruction of the cysts, which contain the hy- datid, and other containing parts, than when water is accumu- lated within the shut cavities. Cases 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 9th, are marked proofs of this fact, and also the case which occurred to Dr Home. The hy- datids were, in that instance, probably generated within the I liver, from which they extended to the abdomen, and also up- t wards towards the thorax; and, had the patient lived but for a

OF INTESTINAI. CONCRETIONS. 51 Cask III.—“ 1789, Sept. M‘Kenzie, tailor in Edin- burgh, a;t. 38 years, has for eight years had a ball in his intes- tines. About three years ago, when I first saw him with Dr Gkegoby, it was felt at the right side of the umbilicus, and ap- peared to be about the size of a large walnut. It is now consi- derably enlarged, and has fallen down as low as the os pubis, and is not near so moveable as formerly. Castor oil was pre- .scribed, which has always kept his body open. He is often in great pain, and is willing to submit to any operation ; but as there is still reason to hojte that the concretion may be discharged by the anus, and as there is no adhesion of tlie gut to the con- taining parts, an operation was not thought ailvisable. “ The patient died a few months thereafter, and a concretion, larger than a golf-ball, was found in the ilium, near its lower end.” Conclusion.—The preceding observations apjx?ar to me to Imvc e.stablished the following projjositions : I. That the greater number of intestinal concretions consist chiefly of fibres of the beard of the oat, which are intimately matted together, and which probably have !>cen attracted by a central nucleus. II. That intestinal concretions occasion a derangement of the functions of the alimentary canal, and create griping, obstinate and long-contiiuK'd colicky ])ains, which arc generally limited to that part of the intestinal canal whiclt contains the concretion, and which are occasionally more severe ujxm the patient taking acids, or food of difficult digestion. III. That intestinal concretions may be generally felt within the intestines, and when two or more of these are lodged within the intestines, they may be made to strike against each other. I\". That intestinal concretions frequently change their .situa-

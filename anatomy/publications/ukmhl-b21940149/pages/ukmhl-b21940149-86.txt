VIII. That, in the earlier stages of the disease, while the con- cretion may be moved from one part of the intestines to another, all that can be done is, to operate on the bowels, partly through the medium of mechanical action, and partly by lubricating the alimentary canal by the exhibition of proper medicines, in order that the concretion may be discharged along with the fieces, or may descend into the rectum, from which it may be artificially extracted.

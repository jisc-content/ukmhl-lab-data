OF SCIURHUS AND CANCKU 452 neighbouring parts, as from the cardia and pylorus to the sto- mach, or from the cardia to the diaphragm, or from one bowel to another, or from the stomach to the liver. There is much variety as to the thickness of the coats of the attccted part, as to the proportion of cartilage in the tumor, and also in the appearance of those which grow inwardly, as when the disease affects the mamma, testes and hips, I shall describe these varieties as they occur in the stomach. 1st, We observe an universal and unnatural thickening and hardness of the coats of the stomach, sometimes only at, and in the vicinity of, the pylorus, which somewhat resembles the os uteri, and the thickness is, on some occasions, much greater on one side of the pylorus than the other; hence the passage through the pylorus is not direct, the thickened portions acting somewhat like valves, and obstructing the passage to a greater OT' less degree. There is, in such cases, a stratum of a yellow dense substance, between the muscular and villous coat. There are transverse white lines of a cartilaginous hardness, passing through the muscular coat, to be seen on making a section of it. The rugae, on the internal surface of the stomach, are much thickened, enlarged and indurated. Scirrhous tubercles are frequently observed in the liver in such cases. 2J, Thfe mucous coat of the stomach has sometimes been studded over with a number of processes of a cartilaginous con- sistence. We sometimes observe a hard' tumour lying transversely across the pylorus, the parietes of which are very much thickened, and crossed by thin cartilaginous striae. The coats of the stomach become rather thinner than in the healthy state, and acquire such a degree of hardness, as to re- semble cartilage. Sd, In the third variety, there are one or more circumscribed tumours of a rounded form, with narrow necks, growing from the muous coat of the stomach, that, in some cases, attain the

506 OF CHRONIC inflammation OF THE SECTlOiN IV. OF THE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE PERITO- NEAL COAT OF THE INTESTINES. This inflammation is more frequent than the acute. Upon dissection, the peritoneal coat is found much thickened in different places, from the thickening of the subjacent cellular tissue. The different turns of the Intestines are found adhering to each other, to the omentum, and often to the parietes of the abdomen, by vascular fibrine, which has been converted into membranous adhesions of different lengths ; and more or less se- rum is generally effused within the abdomen ; and, at the same time, the peritoneum is sometimes tuberculated to a greater or less extent. Purulent matter is frequently found in the cavity of the ab- domen, or lodged witbin small cysts between the adhering intes- tines ; and, occasionally, there is ulceration of the mucous mem- brane. The symptoms of the disease are milder than those of the more acute form ; these are, distention of the belly, accom- panied with sense of heat, and slight pain, which is constant, or only occasional, and this is limited or diffused, and is in- creased on pressure or motion, and especially during the erect position. Some patients complain of tenderness rather than pain in the belly ; others of no degree of pain, though, upon dissec- tion, the turns of the intestines have been found adhering to each other. The pulse is generally small, full, and hard, the tongue furred, and the breathing somewhat laborious, and rather quicker than in health. In some cases the above .symptoms are more moderate. There is variable appetite, merely accompanied with irregular bowels, and some degree of tenderness of the belly, a sense of distention of the belly, which scarcely amounts to pain, excepting when considerable pressure is ajiplied ; some patients suffer from con- stipation, others from diarrhoea.

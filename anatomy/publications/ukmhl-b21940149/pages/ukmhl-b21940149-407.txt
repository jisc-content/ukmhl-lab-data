OF THE CONSTRICTION OF THE STOMACH. 359 From the continuance of the disease, he became much ema- ciated, and his pulse was small and quick. Notwithstanding a long protracted course of mercury, cicuta and hyoscyamus, the disease increased; and after having la- boured under it for three years, he died very suddenly. Upon examining the body, a stricture was found in the mid- dle part of the gullet, about half an inch in extent. The oesophagus internally, immediately above the stricture, was in a state of ulceration, and there was an oblique canal through which a probe could be passed into tlie trachea. The sudden death of the patient seemed to have been owing to the purulent matter getting into the trachea. OF THE INFLAMMATORY CONSTRICTION OF THE STOMACH. The thickening and induration of the mucous membrane of the stomach, and more especially of that portion which is situ- ated at its pyloric orifice, imjiedes the free exit of the contents of that organ, deranges the functions of the stomach, and in- duces a loss of power in the muscular coat of the organ, which is essential to the process of digestion. The stomach has sometimes been found much contracted when the pylorus is thickened. This hapjK-ned in the case of the late Mr Royston. This gentleman had an inordinate appe- tite. The cause of his disease seemed to have been the having taken ice when he was over-heated. The stomach was found small and empty, contracted in the middle, of a dark reddish hue, and the pylorus was much thickened. In consequence of inflammation, muscles lose their contractile ^ power; hence, the loss of tone of the stomach consequent to dis- J tention, probably also depends upon a degree of inflammation of 1 the muscular coats of the stomach. This opinion receives support from what takes place in re- spect to the intestines, in a case of strangulated hernia. One of the most common causes of inflammation of the intes- tinal tube, is stricture, as often takes place from a strangulated

( ISl ) f EXPLANATION OF PLATES, ILLUSTRATIVE OF CRURAL HERNIA. PLATE 1. This plate, which was copied from an lulmirable engraving ol Scah- PA, cxhil)its, of its natural size, a crural hernia in the male, and its relation to the neighbouring bloodvessels and spermatic cord, and hence explains the manner of operating for an ingui- nal or crural hernia. As a considerable jwrtion of the inguinal canal has been exposed to view, and also the epigastric artery, that artery, when inguinal herni i is within or without the un- der abdominal aperture, and when the protruded bowels follow the whole course of the inguinal canal, is situated on tlie pub«il side of the hernial sac. This engraving also points out tl»e spermatic cord and epigastric ar- tery crossing each other, somew'hat like the strokes of the let- ter X. Hence, supposing the patient to be in an erect ]>osition, if the parts be divided straight upwards over the neck of the sac of a crural hernia, there must be the most imminent danger, \vhen operating upon a male, of dividing the spermatic cord, or epigastric artery, and, in the female, the round ligament of the womb. No. 1, 1, 1, points out the thin membrane which lies under the skin of the abdomen, and which has been turned down, in order to shew the tendinous expansion that is connected with the exter- nal oblique muscle of the abdomen. No. 2 and 2, point out the tendinous expansion of the external ob- lique muscle ; and No. 3, the separation of those tendinous co- lumns which form the under abdominal aperture. The under part of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, stretched be- tween the anterior superior spinous process of the os ilium. No. 5, and the symphysis pubis, No. 4, is thicker and stronger than any other part of it, and somewhat rounded, especially to-

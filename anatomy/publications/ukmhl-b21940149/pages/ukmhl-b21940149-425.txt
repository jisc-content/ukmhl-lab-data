377 ULCERATION OF THE STOMACH. ture of the nervous Influence in general, and of the functions I of this nerve in particular, and its effects, these symptoms can- 1, not be explained in a satisfactory manner. The observations of Lobstein and of Mr Swan upon the II inflamed state of the sympathetic nerve, in tetanus, chlonic con- vulsions, and in cases of very obstinate vomiting, and the effects of various medicines upon this remarkable nerve, render such an opinion probable. OF THE SYMPTOMS OF ULCERATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE STOMACH. The mucous membrane of the alimentary canal is more fre- quently found ulcerated than other membranes of a .similar de- scription, and this ulceration takes place rapidly, even when we have occasion to believe that no very powerful mechanical or chemical stimulus has been applied. It also merits notice, that all parts of the mucous membrane of the alimentary tube are not etjually liable to fall into a state of ulceration; that of the gullet and stomach being much more rare than the ulceration of the intestinal tube. Ulcers of the stomach exhibit different appearances, and are various as to extent. Common ulcers of the mucous membrane of the stomach have usually smooth edges, and present the apjiearance as if a p>or- tion of the mucous membrane had been cut by a knife; where- as cancerous ulcers have retorted edges; and when the disease has made great progress, the edges of the ulcer become very irregular, and fungi of a malign aspect shoot up. Ulcers of the stomach sometimes communicate with the cavi- â€™ ty of the abdomen. There is a remarkable specimen preserved in the Museum of K the University, in which the mucous membrane of the stomach I was ulcerated, and there were various melanotic depositions. There was a large irregular opening communicating with the

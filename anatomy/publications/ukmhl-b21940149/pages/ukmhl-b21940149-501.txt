DEPOSITION OF CARTILAGE AND BONE. 449 OF THE SYMPTOMS. Mktzger’s case above quoted gives a good idea of the symp- toms of this organic disease of the gullet. Dr Webster’s patient laboured for some time under dys- pepsia, accompanied by costiveness, and shortly after, was seized with excruciating pain in the stomach. He died twenty-two hours after the commencement of the attack. When the intestines are in this morbid state, the patient suffers pain, and also has a sense of fulness and weight in the diseased part; the pulse is quicker than natural; there is an almost complete obstruction to the passage of the fseccs, so that they are discharged only after the exhibition of the more active purgatives, and, in consequence of the continuance and increase of the obstruction, inflammation of the intestines, and death fol- low. The following ai’e the concomitant symptoms of the cartila- ginous stricture of the rectum : Slight difficulty of making water is sometimes the earliest symptom ; this is followed by nausea, impaired digestion, colicky pains, tenesmus, and habitual costiveness. The faeces liave not their usual size and shape, but resemble small earth-worms, and a considerable effort is requisite to expel them; and, when the patient is very costive, blood is sometimes discharged with the excrement, together with a quantity of foetid mucus, or purulent matter. As solid faeces cannot pass through the strictiu-e, the contents of the intestines are discharged in a liquid form only. The nature of the disease may frequently be ascertained by the finger in ano, or by the bougie, the introduction of which generally creates very considerable pain. This disease sometimes gives rise to fistula ani. F f

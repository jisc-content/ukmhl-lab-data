( 379 ) SECTION VII. OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND ULCERATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE INTESTINAL TUBE. The chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of tlie intestines is generally a consequence of the acute inflammation ; or, like a similar disease in the mucous membrane of the‘sto- mach, it comes on in a chronic form. Chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the intes- tines assumes the same appearance as the same disease in the mucous membrane of the stomach. This chronic inflammation is occasionally the sequel of ileus, a disease which has sometimes proved fatal on account of the distention of the intestinal canal. The inflammation may be confined to tlie smaller intestines. Hence purgative enemata occasion a discharge of faeces, which may lead the inattentive physician to give a favourable prog- nostic, whilst the disease may be in its progress to a fatal termination. This inflammation is generally combined with ulceration of the colon. It has been much disputed whether ulceration be more com- mon in the mucous membrane of the smaller or of the larger intestines. According to the statements of Dr D. Moi^ro, Sir J. i Pringle and Sir G. Baker, the ulceration, the consequence of dysentery, seldom extended beyond the larger intestines. I Ulcers of the various parts of the alimentary canal are very various as to their size, and form and extent. The ulcers are, on some occasions, not larger than a pin’s head. ^ The ulceration varies in degree ; in one portion of intestine i there arc only small depressions in the mucous membrane, with a slight elevation and thickening of the surrounding portion of the membrane. In some this appearance may be observed to ^ extend over a considerable extent of surface. >1 In another portion the mucous membrane is greatly thick- i

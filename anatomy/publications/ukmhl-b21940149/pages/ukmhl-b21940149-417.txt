OF STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. 369 the state of disease which existed previous to the operation ha- ving become irremediable by this having been, from the reluc- tance of the patient to undergo it, too long deferred. Mr Freer has also practised the same measure on a child born without an anus *, in whom it was found impossible, by means of a trocar, to reach the rectum. The child lived for three weeks afterwards: it sucked and slept well, and seemed free from suffering ; the feces passed freely at the wound: but it died apparently of marasmus. The wounded gut adhered firm- ly to the wound of the parietes of the abtlomen, and there was no appearance of inflammation of the bowels or other viscera. Mr Pring’s patient was sixty-four years of age, and had suffer- ed occasionally, for about a year, at different periods, a dysen- teric affection; for six months she had been known to have a stricture of the intestine, at about the distance of seven inches from the rectum, which increased during the period last men- tioned, until the obstruction became complete, and resisted all the means resorted to for its removal. The operation in ques- tioti, suggested to Mr Pring by the amdogy afforded by what sometimes succeeds to a strangidated hernia, seemed to him the only means capable of averting imimxliate death ; and, accom- panied by Mr George Noumax and Mr George Skinner, he performed it in the following manner:—“ I made an inci- sion,” Mr Pring says, “ on the left side of the abdomen, fe- ginning about two inches above, and one inch on the inside, of the anterior superior spinous process of the ileum. This inci- sion was extended obliquely downwards and inwards to within three-quarters of an inch of the edge of Poujiart’s ligament: the fascia covering the abdominal muscles was thus exposed to the ex- tent of between three and four inches. An opening was then made through the external and internal oblique, and the transversalis, muscles ; which opening was enlarged, with a bistoury conducted Such an operation, it is proper to remark, for the sake of historical ac- curacy, had been already performed, successfully, by Mr Duret, a surgeon at Brest; but Mr Freer resorted to it from being prompted by analogy, not being aware of there being on record such a precedent.

OF THE DEPOSITION OF CARTILAGE AND BONE ON THE MUCOUS COAT OF THE ALI.’^IENTARY CANAL. A sMALL}X)rtion of the coats of the alimentary canal has been occasionally converted into cartilage, and even into bone, or car- tilaginous tumours have grown from them: Such organic de- rangements are most common in tlie gullet *, or in the rectum • Metbqeb, in his Advers. Med. p. 176 and 177, has thus described an ossification of the gullet. The patient, a postilion, who was much addicted to dram-drinking, lost the power of swallowing solids, and at length even fluids would not pass : “ Discisso jjer longum canali (oesophago) parietes non solum ossefactos, sed et crassitie plurimum auctos cemere erat; et quod rei caput est, villosa nervea, ac duplex musculosa oesophagi tunicai cum cellulo- sa circumjacente, ab organica sua structura ita degeneraverant, ut unam eamque inorganicam ostendereut ma.ssam. “ Vicinse glandulae ex conglobatarum genere durse erant et atrae.” Dr Walter, of Berlin, has described, in his Catalogue, No* 1536, a still

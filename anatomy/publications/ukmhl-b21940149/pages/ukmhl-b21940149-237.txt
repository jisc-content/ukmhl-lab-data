193 INTESTINAL VERMES. wliich three vesicles may be observed, with an aperture in the middle, is obtuse, and the tail ends in a sharp point. According to Goktze this worm is viviparous; but accord- ing to Bhemser oviparous. This worm has a distinct cuticle, cutis vera, and annular muscles. The male seems to have only an oesophagus, stomacli, and intestines. The stomach is a round bag, situated at the sides of the oesophagus ; this, according to Goetze, constitutes a dis- tinguishing character of the species. The male organs of generation have not as yet been de- tected. In the female, the apparatus for generation is visible. It be- gins as a slender tube, from a small opening, which is situateti near the middle of the body ; it gradually becomes larger, and surrounds the intestinal canal. The uterus is not bifurcated as in the next species, Ascaris lumbricoides; and its end is as large as any other part of it. Ascaris lumbricoides.â€”This worm has generally been called Lumbricus. It was formerly supposetl to Ik; the same as the earth-worm, but it is very distinct in its characters. It has a round body, about the thickness of a small writing pen, and is generally from six to fifteen inches in length. Vid. Plate IV. The smallest are whitish, and almost transparent, when exa- mined soon after they have been passed; the larger are of a greenish-yellow colour. They are very prone to putrefaction; the larger sooner pu- trefy than the smaller. I have seen the largest burst in the course of a day or two after being voided. The head is divided into three lobes, which are joined at their bases, betwixt which the mouth of the animal, which is of a triangular form, is placed. The anus of the animal opens a little way from the extremity of the worm, upon the under sur- face, by a curved fissure.

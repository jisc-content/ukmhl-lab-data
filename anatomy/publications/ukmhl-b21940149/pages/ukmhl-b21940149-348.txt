300 or MUSCLES CONVERTED one side of the body becomes jiaralytic, and also in some cases of unreduced dislocation, and of palsy from the poison of lead. The tendons and ligaments are also changed in their texture ; and are converted into a substance resembling cellular sub- stance. OF MUSCLES CONVERTED INTO A FATTY OR CARTI- LAGINOUS SUBSTANCE. When the muscular substance of a dead animal is exposed for a long time to a stream of water, it is converted into a mat- ter like to spermaceti. A change somewhat similar has been observed to take place in the living body, by Louis, Maugee, Vic d’AzYE, Adams, and by other authors. L.ennec and Adams have described the human heart as hav- ing been converted into a substance of a pale yellow colour. The muscles of sheep, according to Vaughan, undergo a similar change. In some cases the muscular substance does not entirely dis- appear, but is intermixed with a quantity of a lardaceous mat- ter. The muscular substance is sometimes absorbed, and cartilage or bone is deposited in its stead. Of this change I have seen many Instances, and I have in my possession a most remarkable speci- men, in which the whole of the heart, with the exception of the posterior auricle, has been converted into a mass of bone. A very remarkable instance of the conversion of the muscular substance of the intestines into a cartilaginous-like matter, occurred to my learned colleague Dr Home, last winter. The following is a brief sketch of that very remarkable case, as extracted from the Journal of the Clinical Ward of the Hospital at Edin- burgh. “ The patient, J. R., aet. 35, was admitted into the clinical ward 16th December 1828. There is distinct hard tumour in the si- tuation of the spleen, extending into the umbilical region, and

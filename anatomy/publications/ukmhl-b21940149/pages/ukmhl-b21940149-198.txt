156 OF UMBILICAL HERNIA. The hernial tumour is by no means invariably of the same form, being sometimes conical, round, or cylindrical. There is no appearance of the cicatrix of the navel, except at one side, or near to the apex of the tumour. Upon removing the skin, the superficial fascia, which covers the protruded peritoneum forming the hernial sac, comes into view, and the tendinous aponeurosis of the abdominal muscles surrounds its neck. Owing to the thinness and shortness'of the omentum of chil- dren, it is seldom found within the hernial tumour, which is usually filled by a knuckle of the smaller intestine. This, like other hernia, is to be imputed to those causes which diminish the resistance of the parietes of the abdomen, or in- crease the pressure upon the contained bowels. One of the more frequent causes of this kind of hernia is a very large navel string. The umbilicus is a cicatrix, formed by the skin, the shrunk umbilical vessels, and the contracted tendinous ring in the linea alba. A short time elapses before these parts are sufficiently conso- lidated : hence the disease often appears when children are a few days old, and more especially during the weaning, from fits, of colic, from frequent crying, or from bandages injudiciously applied around the body ; and sometimes also from the want of the necessary support after the navel-string has come off. Heat also predisposes to this kind of hernia. I have been informed by my friend. Dr Forbes, who resided many years in the' West Indies, that nearly two-thirds of the Negro children are afflicted by umbilical hernia. There may be other predisposing causes of this hernia, such as a considerable relaxation of the skin around the navel,—• the non-adhesion of the extremities of the vessels of the navel string,—pressure made upon the child’s body during tedious la- hour,—f)r a dropsy of the belly,—by which I have seen the na- vel protruded, so as to form a prominent and transparent tur mour.

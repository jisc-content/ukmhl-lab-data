252 CONSEQUENCES OF THE ployed for puncturing the bladder above the ossa pubis; in the same manner as the muscles shrink after an attack of palsy, and the alimentary canal in cases of abstinence. SECTION 111. OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TEMPORARY SPASMODIC STRICTURE. The temporary spasmodic stricture, when of considerable duration, is frequently followed by a permanent organic stric- ture. Thus, gall-stones, urinary and alvine concretions, occa- sion a constriction of the passages within which they are im- bedded, both above and below them, by which they are firmly fixed in a certain situation. In the same manner, small calculi entangled between the muscular fasciculi of the bladder of urine, occasion, from their stimulus, an enlargement of the muscular fasciculi of that or- gan, so that its inner surface bears no distant resemblance to that of the inner surface of the heart: thus those small concre- tions become very firmly fixed in their places, and the passage of communication between the small stone and the open cavity of the bladder is, on some occasions, so small as only to admit a hogâ€™s bristle. The portion of the canal above the stricture becomes very much expanded; after wliich, inflammation, ulceration, and ero- | sion follow. Thus faeces, bile, or urine escape into the abdo- i men, pelvis, or scrotum; and, from an unnatural communication j having been established between the neighbouring parts, puru- i lent matter passes from the gullet into the windpipe; or the ^ urine is discharged through a fistulous opening into the intc.sti- num rectum. Another effect of an impediment to the free egress of the food and urine, is the protrusion of the internal mucous membrane between the muscular fasciculi of the constricted intestine or

EXPLANATION OF PLATES, 152 wards the ossa pubis: it has been described under the name of Poupartâ€™s Ligament; and, more lately, it has been called by anatomists. Crural Arch. It is marked No. 7, 7, as it extends over the flexor muscles, great bloodvessels, and nerves of the thigh. No. 5. Is placed upon the anterior and superior spinous process of the os ilium ; and No. 4. upon the symphysis pubis. No. 6. Points out the pubes. The crural bloodvessels, lymphatic vessels of the inferior extremities, and the protruded bowels, No. 8, 8, in cases of crural hernia, pass behind the crural arch. No. 9. Marks the hernial sac formed by the protruded perito- neum, which was covered by cellular substance. The tumour formed by a crural hernia, when detached from the other parts, is very difierent from that of an inguinal hernia. It has a long narrow neck of an uniform diameter, and then suddenly ex- pands into a body, the breadth of which is generally greater than its length. No. 10. Points out the spermatic cord covered by the cremaster mus- cle. The cord passes obliquely through the inguinal canal of the adult, by which the prolapse of the contents of the abdo- men is to a certain degree prevented ; and, owing to this cause, a recent inguinal hernia is situated obliquely. No. 11, Points out the femoral artery, accompanied by the corres- ponding vein, marked by No. 12, which lies on its inner or pu-, bal side. No. 13, 13, Are placed on the anterior crural nerves, PLATE II. This Plate is intended to exhibit the relative situation of the epi- gastric and obturator arteries, in respect to a crural hernia. It was taken from the body of a person afflicted by that disease. Fig. 1. Shews a short tnink common to the epigastric and obturator arteries, which is situated on the ilial side of a crural hernia. A, The abdominal muscles turned forwards. B, The under part of the rectus abdominus.

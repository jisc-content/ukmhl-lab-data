Tlie diaphragmatic hernia is generally the consequence of an unusual aperture in llie diaphragm, occasioned by a wound+, or original nmirormalion. In the former, when recent, the wlgcs of the aperture are irregular ; but, in the latter, snuKUh. Fan- TONi has given a case, in which the protrusion took place at the opening in the diaphragm for the gullet. According to llowi.KS (Med. Records and Researches), the displacctl lx)wels were lodged in a double site, formed by the peritoneum and pleura. In some infants, the unnatural apiTture in the diaphragm is large ; and a considerable share of the contents of the alKlonien passes into the chest, and the child dies in a short time, in consc« quence of an interruption to the functions of the lungs or intes- tinal canal. Ran BY has desc ribed the case of a child who died when two months old t; the stomach, ileum, and csecum, were found in the left cavity of the chest. • Cases somewhat similar are to be found in Meyer Disser. de StranguL Intestin. in oavo AlKlominis.

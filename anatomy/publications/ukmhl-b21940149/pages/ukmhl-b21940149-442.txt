394 MORBID STATE OE THE MUCOUS COAT That the disease is frequently contagious, and more espe- cially in crowded hospitals. 2d, That the mucous membrane of the larger intestines is much more frequently inflamed than that of the smaller. 3d, That there are various grades of this di.sease during dif- ferent epidemic dysenteries, and that its severity is generally proportioned to the extent of the inflammation, and does not invariably occasion ulceration of the mucous membrane; but that, in certain cases, ulceration of the mucous membrane takes place towards the conclusion of the disea.se. 4i/i, That dysentery is characterized by mucous, by muco- purulent, and frequently by bloody, stools. 5th, That the pulse is generally accelerated at the outset of the disease, and becomes more affected when the inflammation extends to the subjacent cellular substance, or when mortificiu tion ensues. SECTION X. OF THE CONVERSION OF THE MUCOUS COAT OF THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES INTO A VERY SOFT SUB- STANCE LIKE PULP. In the former edition of this work, I described this morbid state of the mucous coat very particularly, and observed that, as far as I know, it has not been described by any writer upon pathology. Since I published the first edition, Cuuvkilhier, and Dr Gairdneu* of this city, have published iqx>n the infantile species of this disease. Much information has been given, es- • Dr Gaiepner has produced a very elaborate essay upon this disease, and has cited all the authors who Inivc written on it; and 1 have great sa- tisfaction in referrjng to his very valuable essay.—Transactions of Medico- Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, vol. i. and iii. *

â– 60Z TEMrOllAllY SPASMODIC CONTRACTION When this disorder has been neglected, or improperly treated it is sometimes succeeded by palsy of the upper extremities, by extreme weakness, loss of voice, amaurosis, deafness, or epi- lepsy. The palsy is occasioned by a species of disorganization of the muscles, which, according to Mr J. Hunteb, become drier, more fibrous and tough than usual, and of a cream colour; and, accord- ing to De Haen, the deltoid muscle was, in one case, converted into a membrane. The palsy is, on some occasions, common to both arms, but sometimes limited to one of them. It evidently affects the extensor more than the flexor muscles: Hence the head is bent, and the fingers are clenched. There is a most remarkable peculiarity as to this kind of palsy; it is not accompanied by any loss of sensibility of the affected mem- ber. This disease seldom proves fatal; hence but few opportunities of post-mortem examinations occur. No organic derangement, excepting constriction, was observed by Senac, who examined the bodies of fifty persons who died from the disease. Merition has been made by Wilson and Lieutaud, of the partial thickening of the coats of the intestines ; and Andhal observed, in some instances, traces of inflammation. Lieutaud, in one or two cases, met with livid spots upon the intestines. No visible organic derangement has been found in the brain, cerebellum, or nerves. OF SPASMODIC STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. Stricture of the rectum is often occasioned by a sj">a.sm(xlic contraction of the sphyncter aiii muscle, or by a spasmodic con- traction of thi; muscular coat of the rectum, and this is by no moans a rare diwuder. Tbc most frequent cause of constriction of the rectum is a derangement in the functions of the digestive organs; and it

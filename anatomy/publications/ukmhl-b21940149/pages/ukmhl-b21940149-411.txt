OF STKICTUKE OF THE INTESTINES. .â€˜}63 Tile third is a still more remarkable case. Tartua, in his Treatise upon Poisoning by the Nitric Acid, has described the case of an individual who died three months after having taken the acid. The alimentary canal was reduced to a small volume, its coats were shrivelled, and indurated, and its calibre, through its whole extent, was not greater than that of a common sized writing quill, a sufficient proof that the several coats had been contracted and indurated in consequence of the violent stimulus which had been applied. Stricture is more common in the larger than in the smaller Intestines, and is most common near to the rectum. In a case, preserved in the museum of our University, there was extensive thickening and contraction of arch of colon. Se- veral ulcerated openings communicated with small sacs situ- ated on the exterior of the intestine, which terminated in the cavity of the abdomen. In another case, there occurred ulceration and contraction of colon, following a blow on the belly. The ptitient was a fe- male. And, in a third case, stricture and ulceration of the left a)lon gave rise to symptoms of ileus; and the colon was much dilated above the stricture. In all cases of stricture, the lk*ces are long retained. Fer- mentation comes on, air is generated, and the intestines be- come much distended. The stricture is on some occasions so complete, that fluid faeces only can be passed. Stricture in the course of the smaller intestines or colon may be distinguished, with probability, by the pain and swelling at the seat of the disease, and by the noise which matter produces in passing through the straitened part. If the stricture be in the colon, the place constricted may perhaps be detected by ob- ser\'ing how much fluid can be thrown up by a clyster, and by consulting the feelings of the patient whilst it is thrown up. The following case affords a striking illustration of stricture.

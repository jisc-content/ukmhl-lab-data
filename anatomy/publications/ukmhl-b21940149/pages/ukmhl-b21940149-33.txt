XXVll INTRODUCTION. With the view of reducing the price, a smaller type has been adopted. The engravings represent certain Intestinal Worms, an unusual distribution of the Epigas- tric and Obturator arteries, and some diseased ap- pearances with which the professional eye is not yet quite familiar. The engraving representing the Medullary- Sarcoma of the Stomach, was taken from a drawing of a very remarkable specimen of that disease, which was copied from nature by my friend Dr Savage, and it conveys, in my opinion, a very faithful delineation of this malignant disorder. The engravings of the Intestinal Worms and the albuminous Tumour of the Liver, were taken from drawings executed by tliat distinguished artist Mr T. Svme. Shovdd this work, by unfolding the nature of diseases, accompanied by organic derangement, and by an exposi- tion of tiic concomitant symptoms, tend to suggest the means of obviating such diseasesâ€”should it lead to the advancement of Morbid Anatomy, by stimulating those engaged in the medical profession to the prosecution of a study wliich forms the most solid foundation of medi- cal science, and which must be regarded as the ground- work of a great building, to be finished by the united labour of future ages, it will afford me the most heart- felt gratification, and compensate the time and labour I have devoted to the subject.

OF ALVINE CONCRETIONS, 23 Calculi, in all respects similar to biliary calculi, have also been found within the alimentary canal ♦. There is a third kind of concretion, which consists chiefly of inspissated lymph ; and this inspissated lymph sometimes serves to bind together cherry stones, or other extraneous bodies, which have been accidentally swallowed. Concretions of this description sometimes acquire a consider- able bulk, and produce costiveness, distention of the bowels, and symptoms of incipient inflammation. Some authors have described a species of white calculus, which has been discharged liy vomiting, by persons afflicted by gout; but I have never seen any specimen of that sort, and may be permitted to suggest, that it has probably some relation to that kind of biliary calculus which resembles spermaceti. In order to throw farther light upon the nature of these con- cretions, I have subjoined descriptions of three of the more common kind of alvine concretions, drawn up according to the manner of Wernee, by my colleague Professor Jameson. “ No. 1.—Colour of the cut surface, intermediate between yellowish-brown and chesnut-brown. Shape, tuberose, and perforated. Liislrc, dull. Fracture, delicate, promiscuous fibrous. Tran^arency, opaque. Streak, not altered in the streak. Hardness, yields readily to the nail, and receives an impres- sion from the finger. Tenacity, sectilc. Frang’ibUity, difficultly frangible. Feel, feels fine and rather meagre. Is light. “ N. B.—The external shape is coated with a dark-brown co- loured crust, which is soft, brittle, resinous in the streak, and Viil. Mohgagki, Epist. 37. Art. 21.

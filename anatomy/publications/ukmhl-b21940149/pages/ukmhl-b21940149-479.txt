OF POLYPI IN THE STOMACH. 431 i was not consented to. The symptoms of distress continued daily to grow worse, and the health of the patient became so precarious and infirm, as to induce serious apprehensions for her life; in consequence of which, by great entreaty, she at last consente<l to the removal of the tumour: this was done, without any difficulty, by means of ligature. She suffered much agony during the strangulation of the tumour, and indeed for a consi- derable time after it dropt off; much inflammation and slough- ing were endured, and for a week or ten days, appearances were rather formidable. By degrees, however, the inflammation sub- sided, the parts became easy, the prolapsus ani was quite re- moved, the functions of the stomach and intestines became more natural, and since that time, now nearly two years, her health I has gradually mended, and is at present much better than at any time for the last twelve years of her life. She has had no i haemorrhoidal attack since the removal of the tumour; no dis- I charge of blood ; nor has she any feeling in the parts which in- I dicate any remains of disease there.” This case distinctly proves that a polypus (when not malig- I nant), is simply a local disorder; for the disease was completely I eradicated by the ojieration, and did not return; and, in further i corroboration of the above opinion, it may not be improper to add, i that, in my Father’s Case Books, there are several instances in } which polypi have been removed from the nose, uvula, pharj'nx, t and uterus, and where there had been no return of the disease i after the lapse of five, ten, or even twenty years. Small polypi, with narrow necks, somcrimes come off along 1 with the faeces, after having proved a cause of colic and n very considerable uneasiness. I lately attended a young lady, 1 who passed a polypus of the size of a small olive, and whose « bowels had been previously much deranged: she has had no H symptom whatever of pain about the anus since the passing of il the polypus, so that the disea.se may not perhaps return Some valuable remarks on tumours of the Iiitestinum rectum occur • in the works of Delpech.

CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCULAR FIBRES. 245 Before introducing an instrument into the urethra, and also before the operation of lithotomy, it seems to me to be always advisable to give a large dose of laudanum, not only to mitigate the excruciating pain of that operation, but also to facilitate the discovering the stone, and its extraction from the bladder ; in the same manner, as the application of the infusion of the extract of belladonna to the eyebrow or eyelids facilitates the extraction of a cataract, by dilating the pupil of the eye. The stone within the bladder is sometimes grasped, and firmly retained, by the contraction of the muscular fibres, after an in- cision has been made into that organ ; but if a large dose of laudanum has been previously given, the extraction of the stone will be easily accomplished, and the danger of pinching the bladder by the forceps (which is frequently the cau.se of in- flammation of that organ) is averted. The use of laudanum, also, removes those sympathetic sen- sations in distant parts of the body, which are excited by any great irritation in the vicinity of the neck of the bladder of urine. In a paper which I published some time agti on Spasm, cases are given by the late Mr All.\n, in which stones loilged within the bladder were retained in that situation by a spasmodic con- traction of the muscular fibres of the bladder. Lithotomy was performed on one of these patients, by Mr Liz- AEs; and Mr Allan statcMl to me by letter, that, “ on the evening of the third day iifter the operation, I introduced my finger into the wound, and hooked out, with the utmost ease, a stone about the size of a turkey-bean, which was lying in the inner opening. The patient recovered without one bad symptom, and this ope- ration I have frequendy'revolved in my mind, and kept the case in view, as a guide in sim'dar circumstances. “ In a conversation w'hich I lately had with you, respecting the spasmodic action of the bladder, you observed, that you thought this untoward circumstance might be, in a great mea- sure or altogether prevented, by exhibiting a tobacco clyster, or giving a large dose of opium, a short time before the opera-

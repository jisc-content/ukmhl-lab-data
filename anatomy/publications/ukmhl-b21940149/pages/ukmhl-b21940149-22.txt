XVI INTRODUCTION. The Thymus Gland and Spleen seem to rank in thfs class ; the former is absorbed before the fifteenth year, and the latter may be diseased, and in the inferior ani- mals has been extracted without occasioning any mani- fest disorder. On this interesting subject, Morbid Anatomy conveys still farther information ; for it proves, that the functions of the animal economy may be continued, even though a considerable part of some of the bowels be in a diseased state, every part of the same organ not being equally important. Thus, life has been prolonged, though one side of the â€¢Lungs, or one of the Kidneys, has been destroyed ; though a part of the Liver has been much diseased; though several inches of the Intestinal tube have been lost; and even though a considerable number of the lacteal vessels were obstructed. Morbid Anatomy likewise shews, that particular parts of certain organs are much more sensible than others. Thus, pressure upon the upper part of the Brain may often be endured for a time ; but when made upon the under surface of that organ, it very soon creates the most alarming symptoms, and often terminates fatally. ' The study of organic derangements, in all their variety of appearances, must also prove a sovereign antidote against premature and ill-founded hypotheses, and conduct the profession to that species of experimental research, and inductive reasoning, which the genius of the great Bacon so happily introduced into other branches of philosophy ; and we may thence Icani to cherish with the greater anxiety that science which has so close a connexion with the healing art, and which points out the most effectual remedy against those dis- orders which originate in a derangement o^ structure.

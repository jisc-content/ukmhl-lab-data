135 VENTRO-INGUINAL HERNIA. “ There was another remarkable circumstance observed, which related to the sac lodged in the scrotum. At the lowest part, there was a hole of communication between that sac and the ca- vity which is between the coats of the testicle. This orifice was so large that the finger could be passed through it, and its margins are so dense as to resist dilatation. It appeared to be the sac of a congenital hernia pushed down before a common one.” Ventro-Inffuinal Hernia. Chapter 15th of Sir A. Coopek’s very valuable treatise on Hernia, contains the first and most accurate description of this kind of hernia. When I was a pupil of the late celebrated Mr Cline, I saw various examples of this variety of inguinal hernia, which never attains a large size. According to Cloquet, this kind of hernia occurs in the pro- portion of one to five *, is smaller than the more common in- guinal hernia, and the bowels do not follow the course of the inguinal canal, but are protruded through the under abdominal aperture only; hence this species has been called the ventro- inguinal hernia. Sir A. Cooper has imputed this kind of hernia to the non- existence, weakness, or rupture of the tendon of the transv'ersa- lis muscle. Mr Cloquet states that the sac of this hernia pushes before it the fascia transversalis, or passes through an opening of that fascia. According to Mr Stanley, the sac is covered by a protru- sion of the fascia transversalis. The epigastric artery is placed along with the spermatic cord, which is covered with the fascia given off by the tendon of the external oblique, but not by the cremaster muscle, on the ilial side of the mouth of the tumour, unless where the tumour has been occasioned by external violence.

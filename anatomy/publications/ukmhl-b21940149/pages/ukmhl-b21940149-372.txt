324 INFI.AMIVIATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE thic and general: sometimes it is acute, and at other times chronic. OF INFLAMIMATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE GULLET. Though the mucous membrane of the gullet be more exposed to some of the exciting causes of inflammation, it is not so fre- quently inflamed as that proper to the intestinal tube. By inflammation, the mucous membrane of the gullet assumes a red hue, is somewhat thickened, and its cuticular lining is raised into vesications. The gullet is liable to inflammation, not only from the general causes exciting this disease in every sensible part of the body, but also from its situation and function. Various animal, vegetable, or mineral poisons, and other ex- traneous bodies, lodged within the gullet, occasion inflammation of that tube. Inflammation is also occasionally communicated to the gullet by diseases of the mouth, the larynx, trachea, bron- chial glands, and aorta. Inflammation of the gullet varies as to degree and extent, so that it occupies a part, or the greater share, of it; and it is often combined with extravasation of blood, constriction, ulceration, gangrene, or perforation of some part of the canal. In the typhus fever, croup, scarlet fever, small-pox, and measles, the gullet is frequently inflamed ; and, in the croup, I have seen it lined by a coagulable lymph. Inflammation of the gullet sometimes comes on in the pro- gress of fever; it occasions great pain and difficulty in swallowing. In a case of this kind which fell under my notice, the mu- cous membrane was found inflamed, especially in its lower third part, and covered by a partial layer of soft coagulable lymph. The inflammation stopped at the cardia abruptly; but towards the pylorus, the mucous membrane was thickened, .soft, and in- flamed.

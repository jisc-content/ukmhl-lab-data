SPASM OF THE GUEI.ET. 268 flaccid ; the omentum was deprived of its I'at; the spleen, pan- creas, and kidneys were perfectly sound.” The following case affords also a good specimen of the symp- toms of spasm :— Whilst a delicate young lady, aged sixteen, was at dinner, a small bit of bread stuck in her throat. By making an exertion, she got it forced down into the stomach ; but, ever since that time, she has had a degree of pain and difficulty in swallowing, which has gradually increased, and even now she swallows li- (juids with difficulty. “ No tumour is to be felt in the neck, and pressing the ceso- phagus pretty strongly, between the thumb and finger, she does not suffer pain from so doing. The spot where every thing stops is nearly an inch above the clavicle; and when food passes the part, she feels as if it were a pin sticking in the place. When liquids pass that part of the oesophagus, they meet with no farther interruption in their passage into the sto- mach. The following important case of spasm of the gullet has been given by Hoffmann. A man, in consequence of excessive grief, was seized with spasm in the pharynx, and difficult deglu- tition, and felt as if some foreign body had been thrust down his throat. During the accession of the spasmodic contraction, the patient was subject to sbivering and sometimes shaking of his extremities, constipation, formation of wind in his intestines, want of sleep ; had hard pulse, and limpid urine. This disease lasted three months, with intervals between the paroxysms. When Hoffmann was consulted, he prescrilx'd mucilaginous substances, combined with antispasmodic medicines, and chiefly his own anodyne li(}uor, to which remedies he added pediluvia, and s(K)thing frictions on the outside of the neck ; and, in this manner, he cured his patient in .six months. Dr Auercuo.mbie, in his very valuable book on the I’aiho- logy of the Stomach and Intestines, has published a very inte- resting case of spasm of the gullet. 1

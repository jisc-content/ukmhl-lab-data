( »«6 ) OF ventral hernia. • A hernial tumour appearing at any part of the belly, except- ing at the natural apertures in the parietes of the abdomen, has been called a Ventral Hernia. It is by no means so frequent as the inguinal, crural, or umbilical hernia. This species is most common between the recti muscles of the abdomen, and has been described by Hippocrates under tlie name of Divulsio, Ruptura Ventris. Some observations have already been made upon the herniae of the linea alba, a species of ventral hernia. Sabatier has described a species of ventral hernia, which he met with very near to the under abdominal aperture, occa- sioned “ par un ecartement des fibres de ce muscle pres I’an- neau.” Though they derange the functions of the alimentary canal to a considerable degree, occasioning nausea, vomiting, and of- ten hiccough, such hernias generally occasion but little pain, are readily reduced, and are rarely strangulated, the base of the tumour being large. The tumour sometimes attains a very considerable size, con- taining a large portion of the ileum, or jejunum, with omentum and mesentery, and sometimes the stomach. I have met with several ventral hernias in the course of the linea alba, or linea semilunaris; in some cases these hernias have appeared in succession, and the majority of these were above the navel; sometimes they are connected with debility, and oc- cur at the same time as other hernias, as has been observed by Gunz. The late Mr A. Burns informed me of a case, in which a patient had all the symptoms of hernia, excepting a tumour. On dissection, a small portion of intestine was found by the at- tending surgeon to have passctl between the fibres of the trans- versalis muscle, forming a small hernia between that and the internal oblicjue muscle.

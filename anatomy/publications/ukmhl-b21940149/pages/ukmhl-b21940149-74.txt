40 OF INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. Some patients are much constipated for two or three days, and have yet a constant inclination to go to stool. Others have watery stools, and discharge, along with these, a quantity of a viscid ropy mucus, or blood, after which they are much re- lieved. Some patients discharge their stools involuntarily. Upon relaxing the parietes of the abdomen, on laying thti patient on his back, a very hard, painful, globular tumour may generally be felt, most frequently in the course of the larger intestines. It can seldom be made to change its place within the intes- tine ; but often appears to do so in consequence of the change of place of the intestine which contains it. Hence the change appears greatest when the concretion is within the smaller intes- tines or arch of the colon, which, from the length of mesentery, or mesocolon, are very moveable. The digestive powers being much impaired, the patient, from the continuance of the disease, becomes very weak, and much emaciated. The pulse, in the earlier stage of the disease, is but little affected. When the disease has been of some duration, the patient has constant pain in his bowels. Concretions have in some cases remained for years before they have been dislodged. In the more fortunate cases, the concretion, after exciting severe nausea and vomiting, has been ejected along with the contents of the stomach, or discharged by stool, or extracted from the rectum. It is not a little remarkable, considering the bulk of some of these concretions, that the intestinal canal is not more frequently completely obstructed. From the duration of the disease, the intestines arc so much obstructed, that laxatives by the mouth, or clysters, arc neces- sary to procure a passage. Some patients arc under the neces- sity of abstaining from solid food ; and others reject the greater ipart of their fpodÂ«

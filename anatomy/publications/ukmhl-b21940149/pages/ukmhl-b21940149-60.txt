26 CHEMICAL ANALYSIS My grancll'athcr has described particularly the dissection of one of his patients who died from an intestinal concretion. He has observed, in the caput coli “ there was a ball of more than seven inches in circumference, with a depression at opposite ends. The intestine had contracted so much at the side of the ball next to the cavity of the colon, that I could not force it through the aperture there, but was obliged to cut the sac in which it was lodged, to take it out.” I examined the body of a woman, whose intestinum ilium contained a couple of intestinal concretions, and found imme- diately beneath the place where the concretions were lodged an evident contraction, of a livid colour, as if a piece of string had been tied around the intestine very tightly. The intestines above the contracted portion were much dila- ted ; and their coats, wdiich were much thicker than usual, had lost their usual structure, and very much resembled thick lea- ther which had been soaked in water. UjX)n opening the intestine above the constricted part, a small aperture was found in its coats, through which pus had been discharged into the cavity of the abdomen. The peritoneal coat, and the greater share of the small intes- tines, were highly inflamed. VI. Alvine concretions sometimes irritate so much as to oc- casion an ulceration of the stomach or intestines. Chemical Analysis of Intestinal Concretions. Morgagni* and Dr Portal-f* have represented intestinal concretions to be similar to biliary calculi, and Van Swieten, Lassus|, and Ricueranu, have compared them to indurated faeces. The only authors who, so far as I can learn, have made any chemical experiments upon human alvine concretions, arc Mr Cadet § and Dr Portal ||. • Vid. I.etter XXXVll. t Vid. Anal.

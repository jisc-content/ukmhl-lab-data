178 OF HEKNIA THROUGH THE MESENTERY. According to Cai.lisen, the intestines have sometimes been strangulated through an aperture in the omentum. Of Hernia through the Mesentery. In this kind of hernia, the displaced intestines pass through an unnatural aperture in the mesentery, and are strangulated *. Sir A. Cooi>p:r has published an engraving, in which the intestines are represented as having passed between the layers of the peritoneum, forming the mesentery. Both patients died in consequence of inflammation in the bowels. Another variety of internal hernia, which I have seen, is pro- duced by the protrusions of the villous and cellular coats of the intestines, through the muscular coats, in the same manner as pouches are formed within the bladder of urine. It sometimes happens, that a process from the intestines passes around the intestines, and proves a cause of strangula- tion. In the remarkable case from which Plate III. was taken, a process grew from the ileum, which passed around, and so greatly compres.sed a portion of the small intestines as to prove the cause of death. I have also seen all the symptoms of strangulation occasioned hy the unnatural adhesion of the convolutions of the ileum; which adhe.sion made considerable pressure upon, and confined a part of, the intestinal canal. My Father met with a case, in which a patient died, with all the symptoms of a strangulated hernia, where the caput coli w'as inverted. U{X)n dissection, the intestines were found adhering to each otl’.cr by means of coagulable lymph : the caput coli was very much distended by faeces, and also inverted and fixed in that situation by unnatural adhesions. To mo it seems jn-obablc, that the distended and Inwrtcd • Vide IMate 1. tig. !• in my Oliscrvntions on Ciunil Hernia, vliicli was Uken from a case of that kind of Hcrnin, which occurred to Dr Rutheb- Fonn.

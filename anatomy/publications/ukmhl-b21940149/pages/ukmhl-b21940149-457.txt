409 STOMACH AND INTESTINES. suddenly, and, from an obvious cause, the belly is uniformly distended and smooth ; the patient does not feel wind moving in his bowels, nor hear the noise of it; he does not pass so much flatus as he used to do in health ; or is not relieved by doing so; nor is the tension of his belly much diminished by pur- gation. The gastric and intestinal tympany contes on very gradually, and frequently without an adequate cause, and is most frequent in delicate and scrofulous children, or in adults labouring under dyspepsia. The convolutions of the intestines in the emaciatctl are often distinguishable by the hand; the patient is sensible of air moving from one place to another; and, whilst it moves, it often produces pain and noise, or Borborygmi^ from the in- testine being spasmodically contracted, and an unusual quan- tity of air is discharged upwards or downwards, which gives relief. If the patient be much emaciated, the turns of the intestines may be distinctly seen alternately rising and falling, whilst the air moves with noise within them. The abdominal tympany is evidently much more Immediately dangerous than the intestinal, as the yir and contents of the alimentary canal, effused into the cavity of the })eritoneum, ex- cite a general and fatal inflammation of the bowels. ^ The intestinal tympany is also often attendetl witli great dan- ger, not only from impairing the digestion, but by producing inflammation and adhesion of the turns of the intestines, and sometimes suppuration and ulceration. In one case, I found that the turns of the intestines which adhered to each other communicated by ulcerated apertures with smooth edges. The inflammation and tympmiy are, however, sometimes co-existent, I and the earlier symptoms are those of inflammation. It is material to be able to distinguish the abdominal tympany S from the gastric and intestinal, because it may be possible to remove the former by an operation; but, if a puncture were tc attempted to be made where the tympany is gastric, or intesti- >6 nal, the bowels, from their distention and pressure on the >2 containing parts, would probably be wounded, and their con-

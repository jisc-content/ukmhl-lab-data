XI INTIJODUCTIOX. .â€˜id, If ])arts of similar structure be subject to similar organic deraugements, Morbid Anatomy tends to un- fold tlie structure of the smaller parts of the human body, which have hitherto esca|)e<l observation^ as-iit shews that many of these are s\d)ject to the same or- ganic derangements as those organs whose structure is obvious to our unassisted senses. 4th, Moubid, like CoArPARATiVE Anatomy, as- sists in distinguishing those organs which are essential to life, from others of less importance, and also shews that every part, even of the same bowel, is not equally sensible, or equally necessary to the prolongation of life. 5th, This study points out the uncertainties and de- ficiencies of medical science, particularly as to the me- thod of cure, and hence may ])ave the way to a new and better mode of treatment. There is reason to apprehend, that some students of medicine are not sufficiently apprizc*<l of the importance of Morbid Anatomy, and of the light which it rcHccts on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases: hence they direct their attention chiefly, or alnjost solely, to the an- atomy of the bo<ly in its sound state. But this limited range of investigation is altogether inadequate to sup})ly correct ideas of morbid structure ; and, as diseases generally produce a change, not in the situation only, but also in the bulk and texture of the part affected, such a course of study is evidently incom- plete, serving to give no information concerning the cause, or the means of its counteraction. There is another description of students, who, though they acknowledge the intimate connexion between Morbid Anatomy and the practice of the different branches of Medicine, do not ftilly comprehend the extent of that connexion. h 2

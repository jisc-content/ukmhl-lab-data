405 OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. an external abscess burst into the posterior part of the colon. This was followed by a copious discharge, by stool, of puru- lent matter; after which the patient soon recovered, though she had laboured for some time under inflammation of the bowels. SECTION XI7. OF BLOOD DISCHARGED FROM THE MUCOUS MEM- BRANE OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. Discharge of blood from the mucous membrane of the sto- mach and intestines is by no means rare, and seems generally to depend on over excitement of the vessels proper to it, or uj>- on ulceration. The effect of excitement on the vessels of mucous membranes may be distinctly seen, when the menses are discharged from the inverted womb : the internal surface is then red from the dis- tention of its bloodvessels. The capillary vessels, in this instance, arc enlarged, so that those which usually contain only the colourless part of the blood, receive also the red globules. Blood is sometimes ob- served to exude from the serous membranes, and sometimes it is effused in the cellular substance, occasioning the bloody phlegmon, or those sanguineous spots under the skin, in scurvy. Hemorrhage from the mucous membrane can scarcely be called a disease, but is the effect of over excitement of the blood- vessels proper to the part. But it also occurs in consequence of debif ^ and, in that case, particular postures occasion it. I have seen blood discharged from the nose, by keeping the head bended forwards for some time: and it has occasionally pro- ceeded from the vessels of the womb, in women of very delicate constitution, in consequence of continuing long in the erect pos- ture. The blood is seldom discharged in its pure state, being gene- rally mixed with mucus, and sometimes with pus.

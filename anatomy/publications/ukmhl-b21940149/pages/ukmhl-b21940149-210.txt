168 OF ISCHIATIC HERNIA. eventrations. Ruysch has described an instance in which the gravid womb was contained in the tumour *. This hemia, according to Heisteu"!-, BaebetteJ, and Platner §, has been mistaken for an abscess; and indeed ab- scesses have sometimes given rise, according to Petit, to a ven- tral hernia ||. OF INTERNAL HERNI.E. lu a former page (72) I enumerated several species of inter- nal hernim. The first has been ali’eady described, viz. where the displaced bowels are contained within the inguinal canal. The second class of internal hernia? comprehends those which are by no means obvious during life, on account of the thickness of the-investing parts; and the third those in which there is no external tumour. OF ISCHIATIC HERNIA. In the ischiatic herniae, which are very rare, and probably, in many instances, connected with a malcionformation of parts, the bowels are protruded through the sacro-sciatic aperture of the pelvis. The tumour is generally of a small size, and its exist- ence is not suspected during the patient’s life, as in the cases re- lated by Bertrandi^, Camper**, and Sir A. Cooper ff, it being covered by the gluteus maximus muscle. On account of the thickness of this muscle, it is difficult to discover the na- ture of the disease during life, if the tumour be small. “ Lohry, La Peyrouse, and others, have described such large tumours. 1, .Journal de Med. tom. 01.—2, Mem. de I’Acad. t InstiU Chir. p. 74.0.

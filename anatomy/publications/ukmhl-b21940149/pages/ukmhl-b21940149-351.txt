Davy states, that in the bodies of some men who had died suddenly in Ceylon, from cholera, “ there was a flaccidity of all the muscular parts, as in animals killed by electricity or hunted to death.” The muscular flesh is sometimes so very soft and tender, that it is ruptured readily. The most remarkable instance of this kind which I have met with, occurred in the heart of a man who had destroyed himself by jumping out of a window. In this case, the muscular fibres were of a brown colour, and so very flabby as to be torn when slightly handled. The muscles of the extremities of the lx)dy are more frequently torn partially than completely. The laceration of the outer stratum of mus- cular fibres is more frequent than that of the inner. It is difficult to explain, in a satisfactory manner, the partial laceration of a muscle; it has been imputed to the violent contraction of one portion of the niuscle, whilst the other portion is at rest. The gullet and stomach have sometimes been lace- rated during the eftbrt of vomiting, or (Vom cramp in the sto- mach. OF RUPTURE OF A PART OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAI,. There are several cases upon record of rupture of the gullet. I have a preparation in which the gullet of a child has l)een ruptured to a considerable extent, in a longitudinal directiem. But sometimes the rupture of the gullet is transverse, as in he case related by Boerhaave. The patient, upon the rupture taking place, suffered very acute pain, his face became pale, hi.s pulse small, his extremities cold, and his body bedewed by a cold sweat. In eighteen hours, after having suffered extreme agony, he died. Mr Dryden * has related the case of an officer whose gullet • Vide Ediu. Metl. Coniiuent. voL xii.

488 ON THE DEPOSITION OF A SUBSTANCE SECTION II. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEPOSITION OF A SUBSTANCE RESEMBI.ING INSPISSATED ALBU- MEN IN THE CELLULAR COAT OF THE ALIMEN- TARY CANAL, AND OTHER ORGANS. The space occupied by the cellular substance is sometimes filled with inspissated albumen. This is the effect of previous inflammation, and, though by no means an unfrequent disease, it has attracted hitherto little notice. The substance deposited is of a grey or bluish colour, and no bloodvessels are seen in it. Different bowels of the abdomen and pelvis, and also the lym- phatic glands in their vicinity, frequently are reduced to the same morbid state, and are often covered by plexus of bloodves- sels. In the earlier stage of the disease, we observe, in the cellu- lar substance, small hard tumours, about the size of a pea; these enlarge in the direction of the raucous coat, and push it before them ; but, in a few cases, the tumour projects towards the peritoneum, and attains a very considerable bulk. In the more advanced stages, the stomach, when affected, ac- quires an unnatural hardness and size, its tunics arc prodigious- ly thickened in some places, and it does not collapse when cut into. Tumours of a pyramidal figure grow internally from the thickened parietes, and diminish the diameter of the part af- fected. On making a section of the stomach, the peritoneal coat is found to be harder, whiter, and thicker than usual; but there is no appearance of the cellular or muscular coats, as their situation is occupied by the albuminous substance. There is some variety in the colour and quantity of the al- buminous matter deposited ; generally it bears a strong resem- blance in colour and consistence to the white part of the skin of an orange, but it is not perfectly homogeneous in its texture, being in some cases harder, and more tran.sparcnt, than in others; and occasionally of the colour and consistence of equal parts

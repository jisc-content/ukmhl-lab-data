63 OF INTUS-SUSCEPTIO. degree of swelling, and thickening of the intestine, were observ- ed upon dissection. “ The end of the ilium, and beginning of the colon, which is called caput caecum coli, had been pushed upwai'ds within the colon, by the muscular action of this portion of the intes- tine, then across the great arch of the colon, and from that downwards to the rectum ; that is, the half of the colon which is on the right side was inverted, and taken with the ilium, which it dragged along with it into the lower half, or left side of the colon. “ The thickness of the coats of the intestine which had been displaced was very remarkable, considering the very rapid pro- gress of the symptoms Ikit, in other instances, the disease assumes a chronic form, the patient’s stomach is much deranged, he has frequent vomiting, colic, and diarrhoea, and frequently discharges blood, and this is succeeiled by frequent and great desire to go to stool, during which only a little mucus and blood are passed, and this is sjxjcdily followed by .symptoms of inflammation of the bowels. intus-susceptio is'very much to lie dreadeil on another ac- count, because, although of itself not always immediately fatal, it is very apt to lay the foundation of a jiennanent stricture, or of mortification of the included intestine. On dissection, we generally also meet with peritonitis to a great extent, and occa- sionally partial gangrene, at the scat of the intius-susceptio, and coagulable lymph fixing the invaginated portion of intestine in its unnatural situation, the coats of which are more or less thickened; hence the impossibility of removing the disorder, even after making an artificial opening into the containing intes- tine. Of a Portion of Intestine discharged by Stool. There have been instances in which a considerable |X)riion of the ilium has been discharged by stool. There are several such specimens in the museum of the Uni- versity of Edinburgh. • F.xtraet from my Father’s Lectures.

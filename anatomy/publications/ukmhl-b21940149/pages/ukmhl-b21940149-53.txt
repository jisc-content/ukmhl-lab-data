He appears to me to have arranged under one head extraneous Ixxlies that have been swallowed, and alvine concretions ; for he names some of those substances, which have been passed by stool, or been found within the in- testines, Silices^, others Lapillos durissinios^ others Albican- tes, rufos, griseos, tophaceos ||, and others, as he says, were like biliary calculi. He seems to have met with but one case in which the concretion was like to most of those in the Museum of the University of Edinburgh, which he calls Substantia* rane et spongiosse, magnitudine dimidii ovi As there is so little mention made by the most eminent authors on pathology respecting alvine concretions, I hope the reader may be induced to pardon the length of the following article. She. The size of these concretions is extremely various. Some do not exceed a garden }x*a in size ; but others are as large as an orange. My grandfather has described .several he met with as being five, six, seven, and even eight inches in circumference; and from the Ixxly of a woman who considted my father, a con- cretion was three years thereafter taken out of the colon, by Mr Rknton, surgeon in Pennycuik, which weighed four pounds.

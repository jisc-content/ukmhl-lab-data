466 OF SCniRHUS AND CANCER by the disease in the stomach, no unhealthy appearance pre- sented itself in the liver. “ The remainder of the abdominal viscera were in a healthy state. “ A slight peculiarity in the formation of the left kidney was observed.

S. “ (A true Copy) Thomas Shortt.'*’ I subjoin a case, communicated to me by the late Mr A. Burns of Glasgow, with remarks upon it by him, as it tends to illustrate the effects of a morbid communication established be- tween the stomach and colon, and also shews that a pulsation is sometimes communicated to a diseased stomach from the sub- jacent arteries. “ The patient, a middle-aged male, had, during many months, gradually declined, and had been much tormented with violent pulsation in the epigastrium, where a very considerable sized tumour was perceptible. On opening the body, I found that the tumour which had occasioned the beating, arose from a dis- eased state of the stomach and colon. They were both matted together, considerably thickened, and very much indurated. The adhesion of the one to the other extended along the line of the great curvature of the stomach. The omentum was neces- sarily involved. The side of the stomach, colon, and omentum, formed a tumour about the size of a large orange, and of a so- lid consistence. The morbid parts lay over the root of the cmliac artery, attached also to the inferior mc.sentcric vessel. It was from the impulse of these, and from the communication of action from the aorta, that tlie apparent pulsation proceedeil. The arterial system was healthy, but the heart and vessels were very small.

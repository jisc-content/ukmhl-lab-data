The name implies, that the disease appears at or soon after birth, but this name is exceptionable, as it gives an in- correct idea of its nature, which is much more frequent a short time after, than at the time of birth, and sometimes shews itself during manhood. This kind of hernia, therefore, should be called the vaginal, instead of the congenital hernia, and it is ne- cessary to add, of the male, to distinguish it from vaginal hernia of the female; as the protruded bowels are contained within the vaginal coat of the testicle, are in immediate contact with the testicle, owing to the* passage through which the testes had passed remaining open, and as the vaginal coat of the testicle forms the hernial sac. In this hernia, the displaced bowels are situated within the canal, through which the testes pass from the abdomen into the scrotum, which, though commonly obliterated, sometimes re- mains open during the whole of life. Hesselbach found the vaginal process of the peritoneum open on both sides, notwithstanding which there was no protru- sion of the bowels. The nature of this kind of hernia was long unknown. We are chiefly indebted to Baron Haller, Wrisberg, Mr Pott, and to Dr and Mr J. Hunter, for our knowledge on this head. There is much irregularity as to the period at which the canal, through which the testes pass, is obliterated. Dr Camper has published the following observations on the subject; he examined for that purpose the bodies of seventeen new-born male children. In eleven, the canal was open on both sides; in three, a portion on the right side was open; and in two, a portion on the left side was open; and in one only, the canal was obliterated on both sides.

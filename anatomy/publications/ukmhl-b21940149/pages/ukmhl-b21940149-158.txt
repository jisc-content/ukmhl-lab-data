124 OF THE SITUATION OF THE ARTERIES which the displaced bowels are lodged within the sheath of the lymphatic vessels, by dividing that part of the crural arch next the pubes, in the manner recommended by Mr Gimbeenat. On the other hand, it frequently happens, when the obtura- tor arises in common with the epigastric artery, that a third branch, nearly of equal size with the obturator, takes its rise from the common trunk. This may be called the artery of the internal part of the crural arch 'i for it runs on the inner side of the crural arch, passes across Gimbernat’s ligament, and when it reaches the symphysis pubis, then divides into a number of small branches, which are distributed upon the inner side of the symphysis pubis. It also merits mention, that a small artery, or two or three small branches, are sometimes sent off from the obturator, in its course from the common trunk to the foramen obturatorium, which are distributed upon that part of the crural arch called Gimbernat’s Ligament, and which may be divided in perform- ing the operation for crural hernia, as recommended by Mr Gimbeenat. When the trunk common to the obturator and epigastric ar- teries is of an inch or an inch and a half in length, the obtura- tor artery is then situate between the symphysis pubis and the hernial sac, and sometimes follows the same course as that part of the crural arch called Gimbernat’s Ligament; of which I have seen several examples. Mr James Waedeop is, I believe, the first who has describ- ed such a distribution of arteries in the case of crural hernia. In that instance, the obturator artery arose from the same trunk as the epigastric artery, and then passed on the puhal side of the neck of the hernial .sac, and described a ssmicirclc around the neck of the sac. Baron Hallee, Lieutaud,' Richtee, and Mueeay of Up- sal, have described such an unusual origin of the obturator ar- tery, but do not make mention of the proportion of cases in which it occurs. I have paid a good deal of attention to this department of anatomy: In my Observations on Crural Hernia (published in

438 or THE MEDULLARY SARCOMA part of the abdomen, and he has not passed urine since last night. Two scanty stools. Pulse 80, feeble. Feet and ankles were oedematous last night. On the fourth day, urine under lb. ii. Abdomen continues tense. Countenance pale. Pulse 72. Of moderate strength. Frequent shooting pains in the belly. Several loose stools from medicine. Anorexia. Tongue moist. On the tenth day, emaciation increasing. In general he suf- fers much pain in what he calls â€œ two himps^ in the epigas- trium. Urine Ib.iss. Lower extremities more swollen, and fluctuation in abdo- men obvious. The debility increased, and the patient died on the eighteenth day. On opening the abdomen, the liver appeared much increased in size. A number of large tuberculated tumours were found on its surface. Some of these, when cut into, were of a hard cheesy consistence, while others, more advanced, were in a state of suppuration. The abdomen contained about lb. xv. of se- rum. The tumour represented in Plate V. was found connected with the cardiac portion of the stomach, the coats of which were somewhat thickened. P It may not be improper to add, that medullary sarcoma of the stomach is not always similar to the medullary matter of the brain, being sometimes more of a yellow, reddish or brown co- lour, and also that there is some variety as to the consistence of different parts of the tumour; the consistence towards the cir- cumference being harder than that in the centre of the tumour, which may perhaps be owing to an imperfect suppuration going on in that part of the swelling, as, according to Mr Abehnethv, happens when the primary disease is seated in the testicle. There is also a coincidence between the external medullary sarcoma, and the internal, which grows from the mucous mem- brane ; in respect that in both there is swelling and enlargement of the glands connected with the absorbent system.

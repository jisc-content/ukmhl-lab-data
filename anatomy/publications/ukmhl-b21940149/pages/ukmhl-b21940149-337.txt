OF PALSY OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. 289 niach ; and hence the aliment will be ])assed per anuin before chylification can possibly have taken place. The muscular power of the alimentary tube is occasionally inordinate or spasmodic, but, in other instances, deficient or atonic; and whenever the one state or the other predominates, obstruction to a greater or less extent follows, together wiih its usual fatal consequences. Palsy seldom or never affects the whole alimentary canal, but is usually limited to the gullet, the stomach, or to a jwrlion of the intestinal tube. Any cause which obstructs this tube, necessarily leads to in- ordinate distention, to fwlsy, and .sometimes to ulceration and rupture, if the obstructing cause continues in operation for some time. From mere debility, as tlie concomitant or sequel of long con- tinued fever, phthisis pulmonalis, or other diseases, a difficulty of swallowing frctpiently ensues; and such a loss-of piwer in the muscular coat of the intestinal tube is al.so the fret|uent con- sequence of apoplexy, palsy, and other organic derangements of the nervous system, and also of those narcotic {xiisons which im- pair or destroy the nervous energy. OF PALSY OF THE GULl.ET. There arc various degrees of palsy of the gullet, as those muscles by which deglutition is accomplished are very differently affected at different times, and, on some occasions, these muscles do not obey a slight stimulus. Hence, in many diseases ac- companied by great debility, a small tea-spoonful cannot be swal- lowed, whilst the contents of a larger spoon readily pass down; and we often observe that the slighter degrees of palsy of the gullet may be obviated by passing a probang. The loss of the power of deglutition is sometimes sudden : on making the attempt to swallow a liquid, a gurgling noise in the throat may be heard, which is speedily followed by the re- jection of the whole or part of it,â€”a proof that, though the nius- T

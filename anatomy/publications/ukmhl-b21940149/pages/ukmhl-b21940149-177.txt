OF THE VAllIETIES OF CRURAL HERNIA. 143 peritoneum, under which a small quantity of fat is found be- tween it and the hernial sac. The neck of the hernial tumour is covered by the upper in- sertion of the falciform process of the fascia lata : the epi- gastric artery is situated on the ilial side of the tumour, and about an inch from it. In the second variety of crural hernia, the protrusion of the bowels takes place through an aperture in the membrane which passes across the crural aperture; a lymphatic gland which had filled up that aperture having been displaced, and pushed to the ilial side of the crural hernia. The stricture, in this instance, is sometimes occasioned by tlie sides of the aperture through which the protruded intes- tine had passed. This variety is peculiar in wanting the fascia propria. The third variety of crural hernia is that in which the pro- truded bowels pass into the sheath surrounding the femoral lymphatics, and then escape by one of the ajiertures, through which the lymphatic vessels enter the sheath, as has l>een accu- rately described by Sir A. Coopeb. The tumour has not a well defined edge, being covered by the fascia lata of the thigh. In this hernia, the strangulation may be occasioned by tlie border of the sheath. The Jburth is that variety of crural hernia where the tumour passes through the ilial side of the lymphatic sheath, into the sheath of the femoral vein. The hernial tumour is originally situated on the pubal side of the femoral vein, having the semilunar fold of the fascia lata stretched across its neck : the epigastric artery is situated on the ilial side of tlie swelling, and its termination is placed in front of the femoral vein, distending the sheath of that ves- sel. In the Jifth variety of this disease, there are two tumours; the one escapes into the sheath of the vein, the other into that of the lymphatic vessels. The late Mr A. Bukns discovered this variety of hernia. 5

AFFLICTED BY HERNIA. 67 change its forni so far as to reduce the patient to a state of im- minent danger. The frequency of hernia, and the number of useful persons from this cause lost to society, gave rise to a charitable institution in London, of which the object is to relieve the ruptured poor; and from the records of this institution, from observations by Aunaud and Gimbeunat, it appears that 1 in 15 is ruptured. JuviLLE states 1 in 30 to be ruptured in Germany; and, ac- cording to Dr Robertson, 1 of 15 of the in-pensioners of Greenwich Hospital is ruptured, and but 1 of 40 of the out- pensioners. Since the publication of my observations on crural hernia, I have endeavoured to ascertain the pi;t)portion of persons who are afflicted by this disease; and, in the course of the inquiry, have received much valuable information from various corres- jiondents. I resorted to the records of our Dispensary, an ample field of information, as is obvious from the following statement. I have added a list of the number of patients who received advice du- ring several years, and also of the number who have got trusses. Years. Total Number of Patients. Single Trusses. Double Trusses.

OF INGUINAL HERNIA. 128 Several patients having umbilical hernia, had also one or two inguinal or femoral hernia, one person had a ventral, and two incuinal hernia*. O The following document, extracted from the 25th volume of the Philosophical Magazine, corroborates tbe former. 3013 pa- tients were examined 741 Double Ruptures. 2272 Single Ruptures. (In both thighs (femoral) \ln both groins (inguinal) f In one thigh (femoral) In one groin (inguinal) t In the navel (umbilical) Total, Males. Females. 3 44 609 85 57 1C3 1520 399 36 97 2225 788-3013. “ Of the single ruptures, more than one-third happened on the left side, and nearly two-thirds on the right side. A very small proportion of triple ruptures, and other extraordinary cases, likewise occurred in the above number; but they,were extremely rare, and mostly existed among the female sex.” The greater size of the inguinal canal predisposes to the inguinal hernia; hence, when that canal is extended beyond its natural diameter, some part of the bowels very often passes into the inguinal canal. Thus the varix of the veins of the spermatic cord, or a hy- drocele of long standing, the upper part of which has insinuated itself within the under abdominal aperture, have been the pre- ludes of inguinal hernia. Upon drawing off the water, some part of the bowels passes into the enlarged inguinal canal, the obstacle to their protrusion having been removed. There is much variety as to the size and as to the form of an inguinal hernia, of which there are Jour different modifica- tions. ’Yhe first is the most frequent, viz. where the displaced bowels have passed through the whole track of the inguinal canal. The bowels insinuate themselves into the small depression formed by the peritona-um, where the spermatic cord passes un- • I am indebted to that distinguished pliysician Dr G. Gkegorv of I.ondon, for this statement.

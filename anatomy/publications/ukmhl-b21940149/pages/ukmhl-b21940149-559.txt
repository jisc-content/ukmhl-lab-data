( 503 ) OF THE SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION OF THE PERITONEAL COAT OF THE INTESTINAI- CA- NAL. The symptoms of’ this disease are by no means uniform in rapidity and urgency, which probably depends upon the de- gree, extent, and different causes which have excited it. Generally the disease assumes a very acute form, is very ra- pid in its progress, and frequently proves fatal in two or three days. It is characterized by loss of appetite, occasional nausea, restlessness, thirst, dry, hot and scaly skin, rigors, sharp, small, irregular and contracted pulse, by extreme tenderness, or rather acute pain, over the whole belly, which is most severe at or near the navel, which is tense; and the pain is much increased by the slightest pressure, any bodily exertion, or by the action of a purgative, or by constipation. When the disease has been of a few hours’ duration, the belly becomes swollen from distention of the bowels with air, which probably is to be imputed to the loss of tone in the coats of the intestines, occasiont^d by the inflammation. The pulse in this disease is various, and not an unerring in- dex of the degree of inflammation. Sometimes it is scarcely ac- celerated, sometimes frequent and full, or small and frequent; when, upon dissection, a considerable effusion of fibrine within the abdomen has been discovered. The pain becomes still more acute at particular times, which is probably owing to the distention and transit of air from one portion of the inflamed bowels to another; the patient tosses from acute pain, and sometimes the belly is so tender that the weight of the clothes cannot be borne, and the pulse becomes more rapid and weaker; and, when vomiting follows, a quan- tity of bilious fluid is discharged, which sometimes contains a portion of feculent matter. The subsequent symptoms are short, laborious and painful respiration, and is performed chiefly by the intercostal muscles.

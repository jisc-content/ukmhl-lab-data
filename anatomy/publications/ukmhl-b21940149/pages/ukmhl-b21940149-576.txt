520 OF THE ORGANIC DISEASES OF THE SECTION XI. ACCIDENTAL DEVELOPEMENT OF SEROUS MEM- BRANES. Cysts are found not only in the cellular tissue, but also fre- quently connected with serous membranes. I have seen such connected with the pia mater, choroid plexus, pericardium, peri- toneum proper to the liver, omentum, uterus. Fallopian tubes, and ovaria, and also with the tunica vaginalis testis. These are frequently small, but sometimes of considerable size. There is one, nearly six inches long, preserved in the Museum of the Univer.sity, which was found in the pericardium, by my assistant Mr Mackenzie. The heart w'as of enormous size. The patient had laboured for some time under the usual symptoms of enlargement of that organ Hydatids are also frequently connected with serous mem- branes *|*. SECTION XII. OF THE ORPANIC DISEASES OF THE MUCOUS GLANDS OF THE INTESTINES. In some instances, the mucous follicles are involved in the organic derangements of the coats of the alimentary canal, but there are also some diseases proper to the mucous follicles ; and inflammation beginning in these, sometimes passes on to ulceration, which is dehned, and distinct. Professor Borns observes, “ that when the groundwork or layer in which they (the mucous follicles) are lodged, is abraded or greatly destroyed, tliey for a time resist and remain distinct, perhaps insulated. • In page 21mention has been made of a large serous cyst and hydatids, which were extracted from the liver. This, as far as I know, was the first operation of the kind which had been j)erformcd in Britain. f Vide page H»9, cl teq.

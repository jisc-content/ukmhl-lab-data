EXPLANATION OF PLATES. 153 C, C, A part of the iliacus internus^ipuscle. D, A part of the psoas muscle. E, The anterior iliac artery. In this case the obturator and epigas- tric arteries arose from the common F. G, The obturator artery passing beliind, and then on the ilial side of the neck of the hernial sac, to pass to the foramen obturatorium I. K, The epigastric artery passing on the ilial side of the herniary sac, and crossing the round ligament of the womb. M, The circumflex artery passing outwards towards the os ilium. Fio. 2. Shews a long trunk common to the epigastric and obturator arteries, the latter, marked letter A, sweeps along the ligament of Gim- bernat, in its course to the foramen obturatorium. Flo. 3. The object of this Engraving is to represent a branch of the epigas- tric artery, which is of a very unusual size, which passes along Gimbernaiâ€™s Ligament, in its course to join the obturator ar- tery. A, The anterior iliac artery. B, The epigastric artery. C, The obturator artery, which takes its origin from the posterior iliac artery. This branch forms a communication between the epigastric and ob- turator arteries, and passes along the ligament of Giml)ernat: it might- be wounded in performing the operation for crural hernia, according to the method recommended by Gimbemat, and its division might prove fatal. I am indebted to the liberality of Mr Liston for this novel case. The engraving, which is of the size of nature, was copied from a preparation in his INIuseum. D, A brancli of the epigastric artery, w'hich, to make it more conspi- cuous, has been shaded. This artery is usually very small, but in this instance is about the size of the trunk of the epigastric or obturator arteries. E, Represents the bladder of urine.

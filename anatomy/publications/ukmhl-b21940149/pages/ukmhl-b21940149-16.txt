INTllODUCTI ON. X divided into two great classes: the First comprehending those whicli proceed from some evident derangement of the organic structure ; and tlie Second, those wliicli ori- ginate in some derangement of tlie functions only of the part affected. As the former class is by far the more numerous, the study of Morbid Anatomy is one of the principal sour- ces from which the knowledge of the nature of diseases can be obtained ; and it has contributed to raise the different branches of medicine from their original state of rudeness and imperfection. The science of Medicine was anciently very imperfect, and it made, during many ages, but little progress ; for the success of medical investigations had not correspond- ed to the genius or industry of those who pursued them, because some fundamental assumption was made, which ought first to have been patiently ascertained, and little or no attention was paid to the dissection of Morbid Bodies; And it is surely a matter of regret, that a subject abounding with so much useful instruction, should not sooner have been cultivated with the same zeal and success as many other branches of philosophy. There are many advantages which are peculiar to the study of Morbid Anatomy, which it may not be im- proper to enumerate. In the 1st place, this study, by elucidating the nature and progress of diseases connected with derangement in the Organic Structure, affords a sure foundation upon which an opinion may be grounded, respecting the nature and progress of .such diseases. 2d, As this study proves, that parts similar in their structure arc subject to the same organic derangements, it exposes the fallacy of many hypotheses which have been propagated respecting organic diseases.

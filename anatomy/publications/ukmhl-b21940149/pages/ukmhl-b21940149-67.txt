33 OF INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. brbwn matter, slightly viscid, of soft consistence, admitting to be moulded into any form, and very fusible, melting below 212". With the small quantity obtained, no more experiments could be made to ascertain more exactly its nature. “ The residual fibrous matter was similar to that from the two preceding concretions, with the exception that it was very slightly, if at all, acted on by solution of potash, and it did not enter into a state of semifusion when heated. “100 parts of this concretion appear to consist of about 56.0 Saline matter. 2.5 Viscid fusible matter. Traces of alvine matten 41.5 Fibrous matter. 100.0 “ No. 4.—This concretion had an alvine smell, but no taslc. “ It burnt like the last; 10 grains afforded 4 grains of a \vhite ash, which seemed to consist of phosjihate of lime, with traces of sulphate of jiotash and sulphate of lime, and a little si- licious sand, “ I had not a sufficient quantity to try the effects of water and alcohol. “ No. 5.—This had an alvine smell. “ It bunit like the two preceding. From 5 grains, 2 grains of grey ash were obtained, which appeared to be composed of phosphate of lime, traces of carbonate of lime, and a little sand. “ The smallness of the quantity prevented any farther exa- mination. Most probably both the last would have been found to be similar, as to their other ingredients, to No. 3. “ From the preceding details, it appears that, in different spe- cimens, the composition of the alvine concretions varies, botli as to their saline and their inflammable contents. “ The fibrous matter which they all contain seems, as Dr Thomson who first examined it considers, a peculiar sub- stance. That obtained from the two first concretions, being soluble c

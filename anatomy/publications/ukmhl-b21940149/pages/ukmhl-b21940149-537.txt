481 FROM THE RECTUM. one of extreme interest, from the alarming appearance of the patient, and the rapid improvement he makes after the vessel is tied. The disease is sometimes marked by the blood coming off in coagulated masses; and it would appear, that, in these cases, the minute vessel is nearly at all times bleeding a little, and that the bload coagulates in the rectum, and accumulates, till such a quantity is collected as excites the patient to go to stool. This, I think, does not take place with the discharge of hasmorrhoids. The affection is also distinguished by the arterial colour of the blood,—that which is haemorrhoidal being probably always venous,” It may not be improper to add, that blood is sometimes dis- charged from the vagina and uterus for a considerable time, which may be mistaken, by an inattentive observer, for the dis- charge of blood from the anus. Ilefore concluding this chapter, it seems necessary to state, that the submucous tissue of the rectum becomes very consi- derably indurated in those who have been afflicted for some time with piles *. When the patient suffers much pain, from swelling and local inflammation, the topical detraction of blood by leeches affords relief. Costiveness, a fret^uent cause of piles, is obviated by the milder cathartics. Some astringent applications do good. If the haemorrhage be slight, it gives relief, but if profuse, it occasions great weakness, and must be restrained by pressure and astringents. • Vide Mr B.

The disease then assumes a chronic form ; it prevents the pa- tient Iroin exertion, proves a source of much irritation, and considerable straining is requisite to discharge the faeces, when they are indurated, by which the prolapse becomes more consi- derable. The tumour at length loses its velvety surface, and acquires a dense covering like to the skin. SECTION 111. OF HERNIjE or ruptures. The importance of the subject on which we are about to en- ter, must be apparent to every one who reflects upon the pre- valence of the disease, on the various forms, contents, and situ- ations of the tumour, on,the ignorance of most patients respect- ing the particular nature of the disease, on the diseases mth which this disease may be confounded, and on the fatal conse- quences which arise from mistakes on this point. No age nor condition of life is entirely exempt from hernias; the old and the young, the laborious and the idle, the corpulent and the lean, the rich and the poor, are subject to it. But though all are liable to this disease, they are not equally so; the differences of age, sex, constitution, mode, and condition of life, not only disposing more or less to hernia in general, but also determining the particular species of the disease. Amongst the different ranks of society, the lower orders, owing perhaps to their continual labour, are most exposed to hernia, and to them the disease proves more certainly fatal, as labour not only gives rise to their complaint, but tends to ag- gravate it when formed, and poverty too often prevents their obtaining the means which may arrest its progress. The disease, when neglected, sometimes proves ffital in a few days, and even when of a milder form always im{)oses on the patient some dcgrei- of restraint; for any muscular exertion may

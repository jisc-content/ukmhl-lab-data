OF OllGANIC DEllANGEMENTS 8 moderate distention of the stomach and intestines ; it is ra])idlv communicated from one part of the abdomen to another, and very frequently proves fatal in a short time, by terminating in gangrene. But, in other cases, in the vicinity of the obstruc- tion, we find the coats of that portion of the alimentary canal, immediately above it, much thickened, in the same manner as the muscular substance of the heart and of the bladder of urine becomes much thickened, where there is an extraordinary impe- diment to the exit of the blood or urine. In such cases, the muscular fibres become thicker, redder, and stronger, to overcome the unnatural resistance. In addition to the above changes, in some cases the part im- mediately above the obstruction is extended into a pouch. I have seen the gullet, when an unnatural body has been lodged within it for a considerable time, or when it has been obstructed by any other cause, dilated into a large pouch, which still farther obstructed the swallowing, and also the breathing; and vvhen that pouch is placed near to the termination of the gullet in the stomach, it may press so^much upon the heart and lungs as to derange the functions of these organs. The stomach, when the pylorus has been obstructed, some- times becomes so prodigiously enlarged as to reach the pelvis ; and the intestines, in like manner, are much dilated, from ob- struction in any part of the intestinal canal. I have seen the intestinum rectum, in consequence of obstruc- tion, so much dilated, as to be capable of containing a childâ€™s head. The veins in the vicinity of the obstruction sometimes be- come enlarged, or varicose, and add materially to the bulk of the tumour; so that when the rectum has been extended, in consequence of an unnatural obstruction, it proves an additional impediment to the free discharge of the urine, or the contents of the uterus. But the part beneath the scat of the obstruction undergoes a very opposite change; it is always somewhat contracted in its diameter. The unnatural pouch, created by the obstruction in the ali- mentary canal, generally adheres to the neighbouring p;u:ts,

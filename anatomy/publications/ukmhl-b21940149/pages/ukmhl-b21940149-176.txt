142 OF THE VARIETIES OF CRURAL HERNIA, Before puberty, there is little difference in the capacity of the pelvis of the male and female; hence crural hernia is a very rare disease in early life. I have never seen an example of it; and Sir Astley Cooper, in his very extensive practice, re- ports that he had met with but one case of the disease. But, after puberty, the female pelvis expands laterally. Before proceeding into detail respecting the varieties of cru- ral hernia, it may not be improper to premise a few general ob- servations. A crural hernia is generally of a small size, rarely larger than a walnut; in a few instances, the swelling can scarcely be said to form an external tumour. A crural hernia has not only the irregular surface of an in- guinal lymphatic gland, but also communicates the same sensa- tion when pressed ; indeed the hernial tumour is, in many cases, in part covered by the inguinal glands. The figure of the hernial tumour, when detached from the other parts, is very different from that of an inguinal hernia: it has a long narrow neck, of an uniform diameter, and then sud- denly expands into a body, the breadth of which is generally greater than its length. The spermatic cord and round ligament are rather more than half an inch distant from the mouth of the sac of the hernia, and on the upper and ilial side of it. Of the Varieties of Crural Hernia. There are several varieties of this disease. 1^^, The most common kind of crural hernia is that in which the bowels are protruded through the crural aperture into the lymphatic sheath, which is thereby much distended and pro- truded. In this instance, the hernial tumour is situated on the pubal side of the femoral vein, and is covered by the fascia propria of Sir Asti.ev Cooper, which is rather thicker than the healtliy

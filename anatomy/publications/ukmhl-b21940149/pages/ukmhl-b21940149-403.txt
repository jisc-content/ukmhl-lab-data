3.55 SYMPTOMS OF STRICTURE. “ Sometimes a part comes up before it passes through the constricted part of the gullet, and coughing is excited. “ When he attempts to swallow any thing solid, it lies for se- veral minutes in the under part of the gullet, then passes down, and he says, while passing, it gives him the same sensa- tions as when any solid body is forcibly thrust through a very narrow passage. “ He has occasionally thrown up from the gullet, a small quan- tity of a gelatinous fluid.” “ His appetite is much impaired, and he has lost much of his flesh and strength. “ Never has had lues venerea in any form.” Mr W. R has, during eight months, laboured under a degree of difficulty in swallowing. Solids pass down more readily than fluids. The obstruction is opposite to the cricoid cartilage of the larynx. In consetjuence of having taken mercury, he thinks he now can swallow liquids and soft focxl more easily than formerly; but still he cannot swallow a solid bolus. He gradually lost his flesh and strength, and died at length, much emaciated. Upon examining his lK)dy, a stricturt' was discovered oppo- site to the uppermost piece of the breast-bone. The coats of that part of the gullet were half-itn-inch thick. The gullet was considerably enlarged above the stricture. The neighbouring lymphatic glands were amsiderably enlarged. On opening the windpipe, the constricted part of the gullet was found to communicate with it by a small oblique passage, which began near to the top of the stricture, and terminated at the back part of the windpipe, opposite to the fourth cartilagi- nous ring. The permanent stricture is of slow growth, and the constric- tion becomes greater and greater, from the gradual aj^roxima- tion of the opposite sides of the canal, nor is there any remis- sion of the symptoms; whereas the stricture from spasm some- times comes on and goes oft" suddenly, and is generally but of short duration ; and its course may be arrested by proper re- medies. z 2

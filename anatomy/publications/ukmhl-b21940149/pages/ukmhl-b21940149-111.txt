77 OF CHRONIC HERNIA. The clironic being the more prevalent form of hernia, I sliall begin by describing it. (^'Chronic Hernia. When the contents of a chronic hernia are reducible, the functions of the bowels are little deranged. The form and size of the tumour are modified by the open- ing or openings through which it passes; hence the pyriform and large size which a scrotal hernia often attains, the small and irreo-ular form of a crural hernia, and the small and cylindri- cal form of an incipient inguinal hernia. The form of the sac varies in the progress of the disease. The mouth of the sac, which is round, oval, or triangular, is usually directed towards the centre of the alxlomen: it is the most contracted part of it, owing to the pressure of the tendinous aperture through which the tumour has passed, which does not admit of the same degree of extension as the cellular and adi- pose substances which usually surround the Ixxly of the sac. In some instances, two sacs pass through the same opening, {vide Plate XII. fig. 2. of first ctlilion), and in instances of in- ternal inguinal hernia there have been three sacs *. Time produces a great change uixm the hernial .sac; there arc instances in which the protruded jH'ritoneum has become much thicker than usual, consisting of distinct layers. When all the layers of a hernial sac have been separated ex- cepting the innermost, it is transparent : it resembles a portion of the protruded intestine, and has been mistaken for it. Such cases are mentioned by Mr C. Bell. The stimulus applietl by the displaced bowels excites, in an unnatural degree, the vessels of the protruded peritoneum, by which it increases in thickness and extent, and thereby accom- modates itself to the quantity of its contents, becoming, in large hernia, so capacious, as to be capable of containing the greater share of the intestines. 'fhe thickness of the sac does not always bear a proportion to • Vide Sir A. Cooper’s Plates of Hernia.

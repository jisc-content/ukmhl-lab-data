9 OF THE ALlMENTAllY CANAL. From the distention continuing, a part of the pouch becomes thinner tlian tlie rest; the absorbent vessels are roused to act more powerfully than usual, by the stimulus of the unnatu- ral distention; the sac becomes thinner and thinner, and at length bursts; or the unnatural sac is destroyed by ulceration. Thus a communication is formed between neighbouring organs, as between the gullet and windpipe, between the stomach and colon, or between the contiguous turns of the intestinal canaL Through this unnatural communication, the contents of the one part pass into another, which proves, on some occasions, the cause of instant death, as when the contents of tlie gullet escape into the windpipe; but, in other instances, life is thus prolong- ed, as when the pylorus is obstructal, and the contents of the stomach pass directly into the colon.

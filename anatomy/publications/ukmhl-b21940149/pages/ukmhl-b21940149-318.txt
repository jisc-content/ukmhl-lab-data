Dr Wilson Philip has also proved by experiments, that the irritation of tlie nerves had no effect whatever in forwarding the digestion of the food, neither did it tend to obviate the difficulty in breathing consequent to the section of the nerves *. OF THE TEMPORARY SPASMODIC CONSTRICTION OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. A temporary spasmodic contraction of the stomach and intes- tines is by no means unfrequent, either in the one or other of these parts, though seldom common to both, and is induced most frequently by a derangement of the functions of the ali- mentary tube. Each of these states occasions symptoms highly distressing, some of which are excessively painful, and followed by the most serious consequences. This morbid contraction proceeds from other causes, and much depends upon discriminating the source of the evil in its earlier stages, as it then may frequently be obviated ; but, if ne- glected, the most serious disorders, such as inflammation, ulce- ration, gangrene and rupture, sometimes follow. Dyspeptics suffer from slight spasm of the stomach, from food of difficult digestion, various acrimonies within the stomach, worms, or other extraneous bodies lodged within it; and this spa.sm proceeds .sometimes so far as to prove highly dangerous, and in some ca.ses fatal. Of the effect of indigestible substances inducing spasm in the stomach, innumerable examples might, if necessary, be cited. Baron Halleu has stated, that the in- flation of the stomach consequent to eating melons had proved fatal. I have seen it create most excruciating pain ; and niy â–  Vide Phil. Trans. Part 1. for

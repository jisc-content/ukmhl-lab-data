OF WOllMS CALLED HYDATIDS. 198 sometimes also observe, lethargy, chorea *, catalepsy -f-, epilepsy, tetanus j, dilatation of the pupil, and other symptoms, which hear a strong resemblance to those of Hydrocephalus acutus. There are also exceptions to the above observations. There is every reason to suppose, that worms have existed for some time within the stomach or intestines, without giving rise to much uneasiness, and the first notice of the disease has been the passing of a worm by stool or by vomiting. There are many authors who have enumerated certain symp- toms as being peculiar to the ttenia, ascaris and trichuris, &c. ; but I suspect, with the exception of the Ascaris vermicularis (which creates uneasiness, violent heat, and itching at the nose and anus, alternate costiveness and diarrhoea, and tenesmus, slimy stools, and sometimes prolapsus ani,) we have not yet ar- rived at such a pitch of accuracy in the diagnosis. Lastly, no- thing is known regarding the origin of worms. SECTION II. OF WOR]\IS CALLED HYDATIDS, WHICH ARE FOUND WITHIN THE ALIMENTARY CANAL, AND ALSO IN OTHER PARTS OF TUB HUMAN BODY. By the term Hydatid, is to be understood a round or oval- ’ shaped semi-opaque pulpy bag, possessing a contractile power, without an external opening, of a pearly or yellowish colour, containing a watery fluid, and often a number of smaller hy- datids, included within its proper capsule or cyst. Cuvier and Rudolpiii regard these cysts or hydatids, as the general envelope or habitation of a genus of animals, called by the latter Cystoccrcus, and containing several species. ■ Vide Eplicni.

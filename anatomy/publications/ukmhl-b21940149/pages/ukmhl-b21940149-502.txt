( 450 ) SECTION XXIII. OF SCIRRHUS and CANCER OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. These disorders are by no means rare in advanced life. It has not yet been fully determined, whether scirrhus begins al- ways in the mucous coat, or the mucous glands. The specimens of this disease which I have examined induce me to adopt the lat- ter hypothesis. Some of these glands do not at first much exceed their natural size, they rapidly become larger, and compress the mucous coat. In favour of such an opinion, it may be observed, that the disease is most common in those parts of the alimentary canal, where the mucous glands are abundant, as at the cardia, pylorus, caput caecum coli, and rectum. The disease is propagated from the mucous glands to the submucous cellular substance, which attains an unnatural thick- ness and hardness, being converted into a dense, tough, yellow substance, through which fibres of a cartilaginous appearance pass transversely. By this disease, the alimentary canal is more or less contract- ed, and, in a few rare cases, has been nearly totally obstructed. The diseased portion has a contracted and irregular form, generally adheres to the neighbouring parts, and, when pressed, feels hard and heavy. Scirrhus is commonly limited to one part of the intestinal canal, but sometimes it pervades a considerable portion of the stomach or of the intestines. The peritoneal coat, in this disease, resembles the coarser kind of parchment, and, in some cases, acquires the transparency of horn. The fibres of the muscular coat arc seldom to be seen, and, when visible, are generally of a paler colour than natural, and

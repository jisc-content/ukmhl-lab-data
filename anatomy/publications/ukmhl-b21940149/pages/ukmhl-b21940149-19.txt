Xlll INTRODUCTION. such an occurrence, it soon loses its natural characters, being converted into a dense, lamellated membrane, which frequently contracts adhesions with the neigh- bouring parts. The intestines, during the different stages of the disease, are more or less twisted, compressed, and in- flamed. In consequence of the displacement, their coats become thicker, and are frequently fixetl to each other, or to the containing sac. The aperture through which the bowels have passed no longer preserves the same relation to the neighbour- ing parts as in a state of health, and, from inflammation, its sides become thicker, as also the neighbouring cellular substance. Of the preceding remarks, the disease called Stricture of the Urethra affords also a very strong illustration. In its earlier stages, the disease is produced by a growth, only membranous, which, in its progress, is converted into ligament, and even into cartilage; and the neighbouring parts are frequently reduced to a morbid state. In addition to the pain and difficulty in discharging the urine, the usual concomitants of stricture, the disease often occasions various constitu- tional symptoms : among these may be enumerated great nervous irritation, despondency, in some cases, bordering on delirium, and, in other cases, symptoms similar to those which accompany the ague. Now, even from these slight observations, it evidently results, that though the medical practitioner, whose ยง,na- tomical knowledge has been derived solely from the study of the human body in a sound state, might per- haps form probable conjectures with regard to the va- rious consequences of a diseased Liver, yet he would be soon constrained to confess his ignorance of many of the

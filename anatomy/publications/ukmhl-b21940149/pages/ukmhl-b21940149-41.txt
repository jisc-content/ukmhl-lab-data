7 or THE AEIMENTAEY CANAL. has gone off gradually, and without the discharge of air by the mouth or anus, it is probable that a part of the accumulated air has been taken up by the absorbent vessels. When the stomach and intestines are distended by air, the ab- domen becomes tense like a drum ; hence the name tympanites iNTESTiNALis has been employed by nosologists, to express this morbid state. As the air sometimes escapes from the intestines into the gene- ral cavity of the abdomen, in consequence of wounds, ulcera- tions, and other diseases, nosologists also describe tlie tympani- tes ABDOMINALIS. It is of some moment to dislinguisli the one species of tym- pany from die other, the former being a much less dangerous affection than the latter. The Abdominal Tympany comes on suddenly, the belly is uniformly distended, in whatever posture the patient is, and also smooth ; the patient is not sensible of wind moving within his bowels, nor does he hear the sound of it; and he is not relieved t>y passing wind, nor is the tension of the belly diminislicd by a purgative. The Intestinal Tympany, on the other hand, comes on very gradually, the turns of the inti'stincs may be traced by a careful examination, and the sound of the air, passing from the contracted to the dilated portion, may be jxjrceivcd, even by the patient himself, who often suffers pain whilst the air jiasses from one portion to another. The patient also discharges an unusual quantity of air, u|i- wards and downwards, by which he is much relieved. It may not be unnecessarv to add, that the intestinal tym- pany has been mistaken for a dropsy of the belly; and, on the other hand, when a small quantity of water is contained with- in the cavity of the belly, and when the intestines have at the same time been filled by air, the distended intestines float upon the water, and render it difficult, unless the patient be examined in different attitudes, to discover the water within the belly.

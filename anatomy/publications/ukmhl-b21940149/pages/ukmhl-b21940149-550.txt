( 494 ) CHAPTER IV, OF THE ORGANIC DISORDERS OF THE PERITONEAL COAT OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. SECTION I. GENEUAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRUCTURE AND DISEASES OF SEROUS MEMBRANE. The serous membranes are soft, semi-transparent, flexible, and somewhat elastic, of considerable strength, and various de- grees of thickness, and largely supplied with absorbents and bloodvessels. The outer flocculent surface of serous membranes is united to the neighbouring parts by fine cellular substance; but the inner is remarkably smooth and free, directed towards certain cavities of the body, and constantly kept moist, by a fluid which is secreted from the exhalant arteries. A serous membrane forms a shut sac, and many of the organs which are lined by a mucous membrane are covered by a serous membrane, as the lungs, stomach, intestines, and uterus. Serous membranes, in the healthy state, do not possess much sensibility, as has been frequently remarked, and distinctly proved by my Father, In three different cases, in which the chest was punctured, he introduced a curved probe, and rubbed the point of it against the pleura, yet the patient did not experience pain. And, in another ca.se, he inserted a long bougie into the chest; and, on turning it round, the patient felt something moving, but did not suffer pain. He also rejxâ€™ated the experiments of Hai.lek upon pigs, removing the intercostal muscles, pricking, and even

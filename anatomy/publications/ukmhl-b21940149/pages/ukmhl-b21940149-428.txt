380 ULCERATIOiJ OF T HE INTESTINAL ILBE. ened, and also rendered very irregular, by numerous deep de- pressions, surrounded by considerably elevated margins. The ulcers are generally found encircled by areolae of a dark-red colour, and many of them are found cicatrised. In some cases, there is so little thickening of parts, that the villous coat seems as if it had been removed by a knife; but in other cases there is very considerable thickening, and the edges of the ulcer assume a ragged appearance. The valvulae conniventes are destroyed, from the continuance of the ulceration. In some instances of ulceration of the intestines, the disease extends to the mesenteric glands. Thickening and ulceration of the mucous coat also occur in dysentery. In a case of that description, which my learned colleague Dr Alison sent to the Museum, the patient, after having been much exposed to cold, was seized with tenesmus and tormina, his stools were liquid, and frequent, and occasionally bloody, and his abdomen became gradually swollen and tense. After having laboured under these symptoms for a month, he died. Upon dissection, the mucous membrane of the colon was found to be of a dark colour, and firm texture, thickened and ulcerated in different places. The ulcers were surrounded by dark coloured areolae, and some of them seemed to be cicatrising. Several of the ulcers extended through the mucous mem- brane. The ulceration seems, in some instances, to begin in the mu- cous glands, and to extend to the mucous membrane. There are several good illustrations of this disease in the Anatomical Museum of the University. The patients had la- boured for several weeks under typhus fever, accompanied by diarrha'a. The ulceration was limited to the mucous membrane of the smaller intestines. In another preparation of ulceration of the smaller intestines, the ulcers were studded with tubercles, some of which had sup-

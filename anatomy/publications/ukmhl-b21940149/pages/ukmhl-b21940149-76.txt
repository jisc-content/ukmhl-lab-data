42 OF INTESTINAL CONCRETIONS. From what has been stated respecting the effects of alvine concretions upon the alimentary canal, it follows that these may at first be moved from one part of it to another, but become afterwards immovable; a circumstance which merits the most particular attention, as it marks the progress of the disease, and points out the chance there may be of dislodging the concre- tion. In consequence of the increased bulk of the concretion within the intestines, the obstruction becomes daily greater and greater, and an inflammation of the intestine follows, which proves fatal. In order to illustrate more fully the symptoms occasioned by concretions witliin the intestines, I have subjoined the following cases from my father’s case-book. Case I.—This patient came from the country, and brought with him a letter from Sir Alexander Douglas, physician in Dundee. “ Sir,—The bearer of this letter, Mr M., comes to consult you about a disorder of many years standing, and I believe of a very singular nature. You will learn much better from himself, than from any account I am able to give you, of the rise and progress of it. I think it only necessary to inform you, that within these two months he has had frequent attacks of violent pain in the region of the spleen, preceded by vomiting, and ten- sion of the stomach and abdomen, sometimes attended with a looseness. No evacuations or medicines, however, give the least relief, excepting opiates, and external fomentations of poppy heads, or the warm bath, which give always present ease ; and sometimes the paroxysm, if I may call it so, keeps off for three or four days. I have never observed the least degree of fever, or quickness of pulse, during the most severe fits of pain. “ I shall be extremely glad to know your opinion of Mr M.’s case. I am. Sir, Your obedient .servant, Alexr. Douglas.” « Nov. 25. 1768.”

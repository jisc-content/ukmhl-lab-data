MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 109 INFERENCES DEDUCIBLE FROM THE FOREGOING REMARKS. From the preceding description of the muscles of the abdo- men, it follows, That, as the hollow bowels of the abdo- men are in immediate contact with the peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles, there must be a constant action and reaction between the containing and contained parts; and hence, that any cause which increases the pressure on the containetl bowels, or diminishes the resistance of the containing part.s, may give rise to hernia. 2d, That, as the contents of the abdomen are placcnl be- tween two compressing forces,â€”the abdominal muscles and dia- phragm, which act alternately or conjunctly upon them, any violent action of the former or of the latter muscles, or the in- ordinate combined action of both, may occasion a displacement of the bowels of the belly ; hence hernia is frecpiently occasioned by violent coughing, straining at stool, blowing on wind instru- ments, &c. and especially by lifting heavy weights, as then, the Iwdy being bent, and the parietes of the abtlomen at the same time relaxed, the muscles exert themselves with a great force. 3d, That, if the peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles be not ruptured, it forms the hernial sac, as it must be pushed before tlie bowels which have been displaced. 4/^, That, as the parietes of the abdomen do not give the same degree of support to their contents where the spermatic cord, round ligament of the uterus, and the crural bloodvessels, pass outwards, the bowels are protruded at .such places, and the frequency of the protrusion bears a ratio to the size and direc- tion of the aperture in the parietes of the abdomen. From the greater capacity of the inguinal canal of the male

ON THK ANATOMY 114 16<4, That, on account of the connection of the llial and transverse fascia? with the crural arch, tlie bowels can be pro- truded only through the foramen crurale; and that, from the greater size of the female crural aperture, the greater width of the female pelvis, a smaller size of Gimbernat’s ligament, and of the iliacus internus and psoas muscles, women are more ex- posed to crural hernia? than males. \lth, From the small size of the crural aperture, and un- yielding nature of the parts ai'ound it, strangulation is more common in this kind of hernia than in the inguinal, especially in the male. 18^7i, That the bowels in crural hernias are frequently pro- truded in a direction perpendicular to the abdomen, and on the fore part of the pectineus muscle; and, on account of the small size of the crural aperture, and unyielding nature of the parts in the vicinity of it, the neck of the tumour is but of a small size, nearly of an uniform diameter, and from half an inch to three quarters of an inch long. On account of the quantity of cellular substance at the bend of the thigh, which yields readily, and on account, also, of the falciform process of the fascia lata, the tumour, in a case of crural hernia, does not descend, but is often reflected, or, as I in my Observations on Crural Hernias observed, tilted upwards upon the crural arch, so that the fundus of it is in the most prominent part, and the body and neck of the sac form a considerable angle with each other; and the tumour sometimes expands literally to a considerable extent. 19^7<, Owing to the superficial fascia, the quantity of fat, cellular substance, and lymphatic glands, which cover a crural hernia, it is very difficult to detect that disorder, which may The cushion of the common truss is so small as to cover one of the Aper- tures only, and, from its thinness, when the circular is tightened with the view of increasing the pressure on the aperture, the pad is raised for- wards from the aperture, because the ossa Ilia and ossa pubis are more elevated than it, in conseijuence of which the truss does not produce the de- sircsl ell’ecl. Ifc therefore directed, that the jiad of the truss should be made much thicker and Larger, and placed Willi such a degree of obliquity, with re- sped to the circidar, as to press upon liolh apertures at the same lime.

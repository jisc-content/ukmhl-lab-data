{ ) SECTION V. OF SYMPTOMS OF ULCERATION OF THE MUCOUS COAT OF THE GULLET. The pharynx, gullet, and trachea have been sometimes ulce- rated from putrid sore-throat. The symptoms which denote ulceration of the mucous coat of the gullet are, slight hot and cold fits ; hectic flushing of the face; pain in the part affected becoming less acute, and detume- faction of the belly; pulse fuller and slower, often irregular.

From the continuance of the disorder, the difficulty of swal- lowing becomes greater and more painful: solids, and even liquids, do not pass down, unless the latter be taken in conside- rable quantity; the liquid passes through the ulcerated sur- face merely by its gravity, the muscular fibres being destroyed ; and hence a small quantity of a fluid cannot be swallowed. The patient becomes very thin, very weak, and also very costive, hot, thirsty, and feverish: the pulse is small and very quick: in this state, he languishes for a few months; at length he is affected by stupor and delirium, and dies com- pletely exhausted.

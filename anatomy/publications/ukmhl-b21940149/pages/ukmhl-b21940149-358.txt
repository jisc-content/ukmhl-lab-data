( 310 ) SECTIOxN [. OF ACUTE inflammation OF THE MUCOUS MEM- BRANE OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL, This kind of inflammation of the alimentary canal is not un- frequent : it is generally limited to a certain portion, and some- times even to one of the coats, from which it generally extends to all the others. Before proceeding to details, it is necessary to premise a few remarks upon the healthy colour, texture, and consistence of the mucous membrane, and upon those causes which occasion such a deviation from the natural state, as may be mistaken for the effects of disease. All accurate anatomists are agi-eed that the mucous mem- brane of every part of the alimentary canal is not of the same texture oi-j colour; but the morbid states of the mucous mem- brane have not yet been investigated with the degree of mi- nuteness which their importance demands. An acquaintance with these states, may, in the case of suspicion of poison having been administered, lead to the detection of the guilty; and it may also lead to an improved method of treating the diseases of this membrane. Durins: an examination of the state of the mucous mem- branes, several circumstances should be kept in view. 1^^, That, during the process of digestion of the food in the stomach, the mucous membrane of that organ assumes a red colour,â€”an observation which also is applicable to the mucous membrane of the uterus and vagina, at the period of menstrua- tion. 2d, The mucous membrane of the stomach, from congestion of blood, assumes, in the feeble as well as the more robust, on some occasions, a red colour, which is discriminated from that of inflammation with great difficulty, even by an experienced observer. This is owing to the capillary vessels being full of blood, and when they arc dilated, there is a tendency in the blood to coagulation; hence the mucous membrane is at first red, and afterwards assumes a brownish or purplish hue.

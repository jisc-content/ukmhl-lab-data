76 OF THE PllEDISPOSING CAUSES OF HEIINIA. A iiialconformation of the pelvis may also give rise to a her- nia of the bladder of urine. I have seen three cases in whicli the back part of the blad- der of urine was inverted and protruded, and formed a red-co- loured tumour on the fore-part of the belly: the surface of the tumour was kept continually moist by the urine, which dis- tilled, drop by drop, from two small holes, the extremities of the ureters. One of the patients was a stout man, thirty-six years of age. The penis was almost entirely awanting. In its stead there was a substance about an inch long. The ossa pu- bis were separated in the man about two inches from each other. The hernia called Ischiatic, may perhaps be occasioned by a malconformation; for the pyriform muscle, sciatic nerve, and small vessels, completely fill up the sciatic notch in the natural state. My father had occasion to visit a child with a large tumour under the glutei muscles, which became tense when the child cried, owing to the tumour containing a large portion of intes- tine. This case is somewhat similar to that related by Papen, in Hallerâ€™s Collection of Surgical Treatises, where there was a very large pendulous tumour on the right side of the anus, which, upon dissection, was found to resemble an oblong flask; its length was an ell, and the circumference of the lower part of it half an ell. The patient was obliged to elevate and compress it, with the view of promoting the discharge of the faeces. Camper has described a similar case in his Demonstrat. Anat. Pathol, lib. xi. The obturator hernia may 'probably be classed under the head of hernia occasioned by the unnatural size of the obturator aperture. In the hernia connected with predisposition, the disease is usually of some duration, and the hernial tumour is generally reducible. It may become irreducible or strangulated ; and hence the disease is acute or chronic.

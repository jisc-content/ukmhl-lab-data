OF CRURAL HERNIA. 141 i first perceived at the groin, and that it is observetl to pass into [ the inguinal canal. These marks, combined with the other ■j symptoms already enumerated, characterise the common inguinal ( hernia. OF CRURAL HF.RNIiE. Mr Gimbernat of Spain, by his minute anatomical researches into the anatomy of the crural arch, has thrown much light on this intricate variety of hernia. It has been universally admitted, that women are more fre- quently afflicted by this kind of hernia than men, and that the disease is very rare before puberty. Camper and Morgagni have informed us that they never have met with this kind of hernia in the male. The causes of these remarkable circumstances have not lieen explained, which led me to institute a comparison lietween the male and female pelvis, and also to examine, with the most scru- pulous attention, the various changes which the pelvis under- goes, as to its size and shape, at different jx?ri(Kls of life. In the female, the bowels in the neighbourhcxxl of the crural aperture are not so fully supported as in the male. That part of the crural arch of the male which is inserted into the linea ilio-pectinea, is somewhat of the form of a crescent, and there- fore the space between it and the anterior iliac vein is very trif- ling ; whereas the same part of the internal edge of the crural arch is much narrower in the female, consequently the crural aperture is more capacious, to which the smaller size of the ili- acus internus and psoas muscles also contributes. The effect of the support of the internal part of the crural arch is rendered still more obvious by an observation of Ar— NAUD, who states, that, of twenty women afflicted by crural hernia, nineteen were married; the relaxation, therefore, in- duced by pregnancy, gives a predisjwsition to crural hernia. The effect of the bones of the pelvis in giving support to its < contents, is also to be taken into account.

OF THE ANATOMY no men are more frequently afflicted by inguinal herniae; and this disease is more dangerous to women, there being, on account of the smaller diameter of the inguinal canal, a greater risk of strangulation. The relaxation of the margins of the apertures in the parie- tes of the abdomen and of the peritoneum, must also give a pre- disposition to hernia; hence a very slight cause induces the dis- order in the weak and debilitated. 5ih, That the spermatic cord and round ligament of the uterus, cannot be compressed during the action of the abdomi- nal muscles, owing chiefly to the peculiar manner in which the under tendinous column of the external oblique muscle is folded beneath the spermatic cord, and fixed to the linea ilio-pectinea. 6th, That the oblique course of the spermatic cord and round ligament of the adult, proves a great barrier to the protrusion of the contents of the abdomen and pelvis, as it serves in some measure the office of a valve; but as the upper aperture is immediately opposite to the under aperture in an infant, in- fants are much more exposed to the hernia at the groin than adults. 1th, That, as the space of more than an inch intervenes be- tween the upper and under abdominal apertures, the intestines may not always pass through the under inguinal aperture, but may be arrested within the canal. In these circumstances, owing to the unyielding structure of the inguinal canal, the her- nial tumour is small, and the tumour is not external to the parietes of the abdomen. Qth, That the phrase Stricture, at the Under Abdominal Aperture, which has been employed even by the most celebrat- ed surgeons, may convey an incorrect idea of the cause of the strangulation in cases of hernias; for it implies, that the spas-. moilic contraction of the tendinous bands of the external oblique muscle.s occasions the strangulation.

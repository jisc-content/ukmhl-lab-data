192 ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF AVORMS. verse canals, which pass across the inferior margin of each joint, and communicate with the longitudinal canals, i hese canals were first injected by Ernest llesides the above canals, there is a pretty large canal in the centre of each joint: this was injected with quicksilver by my Father, and has been particularly described by Dr F. MER, in his Thesis: it divides somewhat like a tree into a number of small lateral branches, which communicate with the lateral oscula, by small openings. This system of vesssels is generally filled by a white fluid, which has been supposed to be subservient to the generation of ihe animal, and, on account of the course of its smaller branches, has been called the Arborescent Ovaria. All the species of taeniae are said by AVerner to be herma- phrodite. Knots have been frequently observed in the worm, which has led to the supposition, that, as two pairs of the oscula were in contact, the worm was in a state of copulation. The head is placed at the smaller, and the tail, which has an oval termination, at the larger extremity of the worm. There are some who do not admit that the terms Head and Tail are correct; because each joint has its proper vessels, and seems capable of existing, for some time, independently of the other ( joints. ASCARIDES. Ascaris vermicularis {Enterabim vermicularis of Dr Leach). â€”This worm is very common in this country, not only in chil- dren, but also in adults. A great many of these worms have been found at one time within the rectum of infants. Ascarides, when recently discharged, are nearly transparent. This is the smallest and most common species of worm, and it is found generally in the rectum. They are about half an inch in length, and divided into three parts. The head, in Vid. IIAM.EII, Disput.

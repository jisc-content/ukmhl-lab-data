OF MELANOSIS OF THE STOMACH. 444 This disease bears some resemblance to purpura. The deposition of a black matter on the alimentary canal has occasionally been observed. It is not peculiar to any one tissue, and I consider it to be secreted by the vessels proper to the part. The quantity secreted is very various : sometimes it appears in patches upon the coats of the bowels, and [at other times there is a small quantity of this black fluid mixed with the con- tents of the bowels. Dr Henry has analyzed with great care the melanotic fluid, and has published the following report as to its nature : “ 1st, By filtering through paper, much of the colouring matter remained on the paper, and the colour of what passed through was much less intense. “ 2d, Boiling does not destroy the colour, nor even when a little caustic potash has been added. “ 3d, It is not changed by acids, even when heated, except by nitric acid, which deprives it of its black colour, and turns it yellow. “ 4th, A stream of chlorine passed through the liquid de- stroys the black colour, and throws down light fawn-coloured flocculi. “ 5th, A few grains of corrosive sublimate stirred up with the fluid, precipitates the whole of the colouring matter, and leaves the supernatant liquid quite clear. “ 6th and 7th, Nitrate of mercury and muriate of tin pro- duce the same effect, but more slowly. “ From these experiments it appears that the black matter is a peculiar secretion, analogous in some properties, especially in the 5th, 6th, and 7th, to the colouring matter of the blood. It would be necessary, however, to repeat and extend the ex- periments on a larger quantity of the fluid, and in a more re- cent state, before any just conclusion can be deduced respecting its nature.”* • Vide Observations on Melano.sis in my Elements of Anatomy ; and also some excellent observations on this disease which have been published by Mr Fawdinoxon.

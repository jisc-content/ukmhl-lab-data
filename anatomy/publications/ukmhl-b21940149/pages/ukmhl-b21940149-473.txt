425 POLYPI OP THE NOSE AND PHAllYNX. OF POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. The earlier symptoms occasioned by a polypus of the nose arc very similar to those of a common catarih. But when the tumour has increased in bulk, by plugging up the nostril, and pressing the partition of the nose to the oppo- site side, it occasions difficult breathing, impedes the passage of the tears into the nose, causing thereby a watering of the eye, and impairing the sense of smell. When it has become still larger, so as to hang backwards into the pharynx, it creates a difficulty in breathing, and also in deglutition, and frccpiently continued headach, probably by compressing the jugular vein, and opposing to a certain extent the free return of blood from the head. j OF POLYPI IN THE PHARYNX. I Polypi frequently are attached to the internal membrane of the pharynx, to the posterior narcs, or cuneiform process of the occipital bone, and occupy a part of the cavity of the pharynx. Polypi within the pharynx give rise to the following symp- I toms, which are referable solely to the pressure of the tumour :— !■ The breathing and deglutition arc more or less interrupted in I proportion to the bulk and length of the tumours; by their pres- i sure on the Eustachian tubes, they create dulness in hearing; t and by impeding the free return of blood from the head by ^ the jugular veins, occasion considerable headach, vertigo, and 9 drowsiness *. The partial enlargement of the cervical vertebrae occasions a 1 swelling in the pharynx not unlike to a polypus. My Father was desired to visit a lady, who had been his tj patient about twenty years before, on account of a polypus <1 which grew from the soft palate, and which was removed by the • I have known patients in this situation, treated as if they were about to 4 be seized with apoplexy.

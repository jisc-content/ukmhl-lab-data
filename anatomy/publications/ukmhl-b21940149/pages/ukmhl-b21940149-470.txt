( 422 ) * SECTION XVI. OF POLYPI GROWING FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. Different kinds of tumours growing from the canals or ca- vities, lined by a mucous membrane, have been arranged un- der the general head of Polypus, from their supposed resem- blance to those animals called polypi; but the analogy is by no means perfect: these tumours being connected to the mucous membrane by one root only. There are the following varieties of polypi. The first is a circumscribed tumour, compre.ssible and move- able, of a round or oval form, of a grey or light-brown colour, semi-transparent, glistening on its surface, with a number of bloodvessels distributed through it, soft, easily torn, sometimes solid, sometimes hollow, filled with a slimy mucus, and bearing a strong resemblance to the internal membrane filled with lymph ; they are much affected by the state of the atmosphere, shrinking in dry, and expanding in moist weather; and, when partially destroyed, they rapidly grow again. Such polypi generally grow from the ossa spongiosa of the nose, from the sinuses of the skull, &c., or from the vagina. This kind of polypus frequently becomes partially inflamed, by which it sometimes contracts adhesions with the cavity with- in which it grows, and then it seems to have several roots. This kind of polypus very seldom degenerates into cancer in young persons, even though it be red and firm, and be cut or torn, com- prcs.scd or otherwise irritated. It is also necessary to ob.scrve, that if a portion of the root of this kind of polypus shall remain, when the rest of the tumour has been removed by ligature, a tumour of the same kind ns that which has been removed soon grows

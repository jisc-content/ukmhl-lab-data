( 41G ) OF THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS BETWEEN THE MIET-LIKE TUMOUR AND THE ANOMALOUS TU- MOUR OF DR ]\rONRO PRIMUS. 1st, The anomalous tumouj of my Grandfather differs, in its situation, from the milt-like tumour ; the former has been found in all the tissues of the body, the latter in the mucous mem- branes only. The anomalous tumour is sometimes connected with the pe- riosteum, the capsular ligaments, especially with that of the hip- joint, the peritoneum, the liver, spleen, ovarium, and uterus, and with the albuginea and vaginal coats of the testicle; with the coats of the optic nerve, and sclerotic coat of the eye. In short, the anomalous tumour is not confined to any one texture, but is common to all; it begins as a distinct elastic tumour, without fluctuation, and some parts of it feel harder than others. In its progress it bursts, and a soft dark purple- coloured fungous excrescence, which bleeds profusely, rises from the centre, and soon increases very rapidly in size. The milt-like tumour is much softer than the anomalous ; be- fore it bursts, it has not the same purple colour and firm elastic feeling as the anomalous tumour, which Dr Burns has com- pared to a sponge tied up very tightly in a piece of bladder; and I have never observed any appearance of fungous ulcera- tion of the milt-like tumour, nor the same inequality in the con- sistence of different parts of it, as in the fungus haematodes. The tumour is nearly of an uniform consistence in every part, and its lobes are not so distinct as those of the anomalous, which are separated from each other by membranes. The milt-like tumour is, in colour and consistence, uniform in every part; but the section of the anomalous tumour ex- hibits, in its parts, a difiTerent colour, and also a different consistence, some portions being as soft as brain, others as hard as the yolk of a boiled egg, and others like cartilage ; besides,

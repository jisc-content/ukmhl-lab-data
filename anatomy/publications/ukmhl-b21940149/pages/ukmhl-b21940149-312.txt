A spasm of the gullet sometimes comes on very suddenly, while the subject of the attack seems in good health ; and its duration is various, for in some cases it lasts only a few hours, but sometimes for many days, weeks, or years. I was acquainted with an elderly gentleman, who was twice in the course of his life seized by a spasm in his gullet during dinner, and, upon both occasions, he lost the power of swallow- ing suddenly, when he seemed, in other respects, to be in good health. The first attack of the disorder lasted only for a few hours, and was removed by an anodyne clyster; but the second was of three or four days’ duration. This patient, for ten years, enjoyed perfect health, and died from inflammation of his lungs. In some cases upon record, the spasm was very readily re- moved, but in others it proved obstinate.

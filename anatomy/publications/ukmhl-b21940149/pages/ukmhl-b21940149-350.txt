OK MUSCl/ES CONVERTED the intestines and parietes of the abdomen, and also between the intestines themselves.” On attempting to remove the intestines the colon was found adhering, in all its course, to the neighbouring parts, viz. to the gall-bladder, the stomach, and lower part of the liver; the small intestines were attached to the parietes of the abdomen; and also to the urinary bladder. The colon having been separated from its adhesions, the small intestines were found to be thickened in their tunics; which had also taken place, even to a greater degree, in the mesentery. The adhering intestines attached to the left side, and which formed the tumour that was felt during life, were removed; they formed one great mass larger than a child’s head, and were found thickened in their coats to an extraordinary degree, generally to about an inch in thickness; and altogether they formed such a heterogeneous mass that it was impossible to say what portion of the intestine partook most of the disease, as one could not be distinguished from another. The peritoneal coat was of a dense uniform structure, quite different in its ap- pearance from the middle coat, in which there were distinct trans- verse fibres running between the peritoneal and inner coat. The valvulae conniventes were much enlarged. In the centre of this mass was found a hard tumour, about the size of a large orange, which seemed to consist of the glands of the mesentery, much indurated, and enlarged to about the size of hazel-nuts, imbedded in a semicarlilaginous substance of a greyish colour. The spleen was smaller than usual; the liver appeared sound, and the gall-bladder was filled with healthy bile. OF SOFTENING OF THE IMIJSCUEAU SUBSTANCE. This is a common conseipiencc of inflammation, and of all low fevers. The softening is not jrcculiar to any one muscle, but to the whole muscular substance of the binly.

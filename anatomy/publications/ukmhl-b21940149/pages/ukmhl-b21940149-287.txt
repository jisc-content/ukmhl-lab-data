OF SPASM AND PALSY. 239 hours. In both, the coats of the bladder were much thickened, so that the capacity of the bladder was much diminished, and in both there was no appearance of constriction in the middle of the bladder, after the lapse of a few days; and it may not be improper to add, that I could not detect any appearance of extraordinary thickening towards the middle of the bladder, the seat of the spasmodic constriction in either case. The contraction of the gravid womb occasionally is so complete in its middle, that only a finger can be passed through the contracted portion ; so that, in order to extract the pla- centa, it is necessary to overcome the stricture, by passing one finger after another through the contracted part. At length, the contraction is taken off, but the doing so gives considerable pain to the woman. The vagina is also liable to a partial and spasmotlic contrac- tion, which sometimes takes place at its mouth, or towards its middle, and this is occasioned by the partial contraction of the sphincter muscle, proper to that canal. The Fallopian tubes arc also sometimes spasmodically contracted into a spiral form, by the partial contraction of their muscular coat. A partial contraction of a portion of the intestinal canal, of the biliary ducts, and of the urethra, also sometimes occurs. The ductus communis choledocus, and the ureters, arc most frequently constricted at their conjunctions with the duodenum and bladder of urine; and, in short, the hollow bowels and ca. nals proper to these have a general muscular coat; but there is no peculiar apparatus for pnxlucing a partial contraction, which is more frequent than the general contraction of the same hol- low bowel or canal connected with it. SECTION II. OF THE CAUSES OF SPASMODIC CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCULAR FIBRES. It would lead to a very long digression, totally foreign to the object of this work, to enumerate the various causes which

• Vide Plate VI. IN THE GULLET. 4>55 the cellulai- substance between the coats of the stomach, had oc- casioned the stricture. There had existed in the constitution of this patient a strong tendency to cancer, for the caidia, smaller curvature of the stomach, diaphragm, pancreas, and uterus, were similarly diseased. The eighth pair of nerves were larger than usual, and flattened, where they passed over the scirrhous masses at the cardia ♦. The dorsal vertebra' and intervertebral c:u:tilages, have some- times also been involved in the more inveterate cases of this disease. OF THE SYMPTOMS. I’ain, and an inability to swallow solids, are the earlier symptoms of this disease; and, after a time, even fluids are arcsted in their course downwards; they remain fora short time in the gullet, and, by distending it, create a sense of suffocation, until ejected through the nose and mouth, by an inverted action of the tube; the piitient is thereby much relieved, and the re- remainder passes down with a gurgling noise, like water flowing through a contractixl passage. The degree of obstruction is different in different cases, and in some is so great as to shut up the passage completely. The following case, communicated to me by Dr Home, gives a good idea of the effects of scirrhus, when situate in the under part of the gullet: The complaint began in the fifth month of pregnancy, with a slight pain in the epigastric region, and distention of the sto- mach. A few days after delivery, the patient was seized with a dif- ficulty in swallowing. In a few months she could swallow no- thing but liquids, or bread soaked in milk or water, and not without a considerable effort.

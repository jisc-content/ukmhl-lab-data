An unnatural irritation, by exciting a partial contraction, sometimes proves a cause of intus-susceptio. Worms frequently have been found at the intus-suscepted portion ; and it seems not improbable that the drastic purgatives employed for the removal of these may increase the mischief. Costiveness is also a frequent source or prelude of this dis- order, the hardened faeces, or scybala, being the causes of con- siderable irritation. Such irritations frequently produce so unnatural a contraction of the parts affected, as to oppose the free passage even of air; for which reason, one part is often contracted, while that imme- diately adjoining remains in its natural state. The unnatural obstruction impairing the functions of the stomach and intes- tines, a quantity of air is generated, which is an additional cause of distention. Symptoms. From what has been stated respecting the morbid appear- ances, it follows, that there are two very different kinds of in- tus-susceptio, viz. that which is unattendetl by inflammation, and that attended by acute inflammation and its consequences. The former, a disease of infancy, in most cases does not in any great degree derange the functions of the alimentary canal; whereas the latter, which may be ranked among the diseases of manhood and old age, is one of the most acute and fatal dis- orders incident to humanity, as the stricture almost immediate- ly causes an inflammation of the displaced intestine ; hence the difficulty of distinguishing this disease from inflammation of the intestines, excited by other causes.

This tube soon becomes larger, it is then called Uterus ; it divides into two canals, which are considerably larger than the uterus, then suddenly diminishes in size, and at last terminates in a number of small opaque threads, which float in the lowest part of the belly, and embrace the intestines. These smallest floating tubes are never empty, but are filled with an opaque fluid, in which there are a number of globular bodies floating. In the male, the small tubes lead to a larger tortuous canal, which may be callerl Vcsicula Scminalis, which is rather more than an inch long, is unequal in its diameter, and follows some- what of a tortuous course. To the extremity of this, a coni- cal shaped body, which may be called Penis, is connected by its base. Some authors have supjwsed that these worms arc vivipa- rous ; which appearance is produced by a part of the append- ages of the uterus having burst through the integuments of the animal. Cloquet of Paris has lately pubfushed a learnetl dissertation on this worm. TRICHOCEPHALUS HO.MiNis, or Wh'tp-Worm. Plate IV. This species is rai’er than any of the other intestinal worms. This worm has been said to be found sometimes in the bodies of those who have died from fever. Pascal * found several of these worms in the bodies of those who were affected by what he has called Mucous Phthisis. It was described and shown by my Father, in his lectures in 1794, as an intestinal worm. The body is round and elastic, from one to two inches long, and it has a filiform tail, about one inch and a half in length. The head is acute, and the mouth orbicular. • Bulletin de la Faculty de ^fedecine de Paris.

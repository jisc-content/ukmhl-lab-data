72 or THE CAUSES OE HERNIA. internal hernia, where there is a small tumour, as when a part of the intestines is engaged within the upper part of the ingui- nal canal; 2d, Where there is a tumour, which, on account of the thickness of its coverings, is in most cases scarcely percepti- ble, as the obturator and ischiatic hernioe; 3d, Where, at the commencement of the disease, there is in most cases no percep- tible tumour, but where, in consequence of the duration of the disease, a tumour appears, as the perineal herniae; There has a species of internal hernia been described, but in my opi- nion improperly, when stricture, amounting to strangulation, has been made upon a part of the intestines, in consequence of an unnatural aperture in the diaphragm, of malconformation of the omentum, mesentery, mesocolon, or of an unnatural appen- dix to the intestines. Of the Causes of Hernia. There being a constant action and reaction between the con- tained and containing parts, those causes which diminish the re- sistance of the containing, or increase the pressure of the con- tained parts, may give rise to hernia. The former are the causes of chronic, the latter of the acute hernia. Those causes which diminish the resistance of the parietes predispose to hernia; and those which increase the pressure of the contained part, are the occasional or exciting causes of the disease. 1^^, Local debility which is connected with the office of the parietes of the abdomen in giving passage to the spermatic cord, round ligament of the uterus, crural and umbilical ve.ssels, pre- disposes to hernia, which predisposition is proportioned to the size of the apertures; men, therefore, are more disposed to the inguinal, and women to the crural hernia. 2d, The unnatural relaxation of the peritoneum which retains the bowels of the belly in their proper situation, may be con- joined with debility of the parietes of, the abdomen, and may *rive rise to hernia; and hence a bowel which, in the healthy >5

202 or THE SAC or hydatids. coagulnble lyniph, and a number of hydatids which have burst, the coats of these being shrunk and inverted. There is a seventh kind of hydatids, with narrow necks, which are frequently attaclied to the placenta. I have also seen hyda- tids of the second species, connected with the placenta. Some of the bowels, as the ovaria and kidneys, are said at t ines to have been converted into hydatids, but it would be more accurate to speak of the conversion of these bowels into watery vt'sicles (the genuine hydatid being rarely found within these bowels). These vesicles have only one coat, they are not inclosed within firm cysts, and do not produce their like, nor do they possess any degree of contractile jxiwer like the genuine hydatid. OJ'the Sac of Hydatids. The sac of the hydatid is formed of condensed cellular sub- stance, and the thickness of the sac generally bears a ratio to its «ize and situation. This sac is secured in its place by several bands of cellular substance, which pass between it and the bowel within whicli it is lodged, and in the abdomen it is covered by the perito- nsEum. The thickness of the sac of a hydatid is proportioned to its size ; although there is a considei’able difference in this particu- lar, the sac being thickest where it is most exposed : thus, when the greater part of the sac is surrounded by the substance of a bowel, as of the liver for instance, that part only of the .sac which is exposed is of a considerable thickness, and is sometimes cartilaginous, or covered by layers of bone. . I have observed that the inner surface of the sac is by no means uniform, but always somewhat irregular, and lined by a very thin layer of fat. A glairy gelatinous liquor is also interposed between the sac and the hydatid, which prevents the hydatids from being in- jured by friction.

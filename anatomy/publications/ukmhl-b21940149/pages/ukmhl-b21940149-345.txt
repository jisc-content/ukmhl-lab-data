OF INFLAMMATION OF MUSCLES. 297 bladder of urine, and of the heart, are excited to an increased action, the effect of which is to enlarge their bulk. When the muscular fibres of the heart or the bladder of urine have attained an unnatural bulk, they are frequently at the same time somewhat indurated, assume a greyish colour, and are not so easily divided by the knife, as in the .sound state. This change is probably connected with chronic inflammation. But where the muscular fibres of the gullet or stomach are thickened, they retain their usual colour, and sometimes assume a deeper red hue than in the sound state. OF THE INFLAMMATION AND SUPPUKATION OF MUSCLES. The chronic inflammation of muscles is much more frequent than the acute; and that of the muscles of the extremities is much more frecjiient than that of the internal viscera. This disease sometimes extends from its primary seat to the neighlxnir- ing tissues, as from the pericardium to the substance of the heart; or it is translated from the external to the internal parts, as has been shewn by different authors, and jiarticularly by the late Sir David Dundas, who wrote a verjâ€™ valuable essay on rheumatism of the heart. I have seen many instances in which rheumatism was trans- lated from the extremities to the muscular substance of the heart. I have frequently seen large patches of lymph upon the surface of the heart, so that the adhesion between that or- gan and its capsule was nearly equal in size to that of a crown piece. I have also seen three or four examples of complete adhesion between the heart and pericardium, and, upon cutting through the muscular substance of the organ, it was of a deep mahogany colour, and the fibres were at the same time soft. The muscular fibres of the stomach and intestines are fre- quently the seat of Inflammation. The acute very often ends in chronic inflammation of the muscular coat of the stomach and intestines. The muscular coat of the stomach and intestines be-

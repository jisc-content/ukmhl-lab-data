479 OF HiFMORRHOIDS OR PILES. Boykr 1ms published several valuable observations on the spasmodic stricture of the rectum, occasioned by fissures in the pile, and has recommended the division of the sphyncter ani for the purpose of removing the disease. These fissures are often formed by the process of ulceration, which sometimes causes absorption of the neck of the pile, and the tumour is discharged per anum. Contraction of the anus is sometimes consequent to piles, and is the result of the induration of the cellular substance around the anus, or of the long continued spasmodic contrac- tion of the sphincter ani, which proves a cause of acute pain, when the patient goes to stool. OF THE SYMPTOMS OF INTERNAL PILES. The symptoms of internal piles are not so obvious as those of the external. Internal piles create less pain than the external, as the sur- rounding parts are more yielding and elastic, and uninfiuenced by the sphyncter muscle, and many patients suffer no other inconvenience from this disorder, except the loss of a small quan- tity of blood when they are costive. When blood from piles is sometimes effused into the cellular substance around the rectum, suppuration follows, and the matter bursts externally, occasion- ing fistula in ano. Internal piles often cannot be seen unless the patient, previously to the examination, sits over the steam of warm water, ami partially inverts the rectum, or by the use of the speculum ani. Internal piles create in some women symp- toms of bearing down, and when they create acute pain, or con- siderable bleeding, sometimes induce abortion. OF ARTERIAL HAEMORRHAGE FROM THE RECTUM. This disease may be mistaken for piles. Dr Abercrombie u has given a very lucid description of this disease, which is as 1 follows *; â–  Vide his Pathology of the Alimentary Canal.

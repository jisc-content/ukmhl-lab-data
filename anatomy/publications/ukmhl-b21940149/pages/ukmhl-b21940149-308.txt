OF HVDROPHORIA. 260 Dr Mead has stated, that the stomach has sometimes been reduced to a state of gangrene by this disorder. Dr Brandreth of I/iverpool has published one of the most important dissections of hydrophobia. The patient liad received several lacerated and punctured wounds, from the dog’s teeth, in both wrists, and in one hand. The most careful excision was practised within half an hour after the bite was received, and caustic was afterwards applied ; but as the worst wound was above the pisiform bone, and among the ligaments, it was impossible to destroy the parts ef- fectually. The patient laboured under the usual symptoms, and what was remarkable, he forced himself to swallow liquids almost to the last. Opium and colchicum were the principal remedies employed. The patient lived for nearly eleven months after the receipt of the bite. Dissection.—The dura mater was preternaturally vascular The arachnoid was opake, and between it and the pia mater there was some serous effusion. The pia mater was vascularity it.self, and presented a complete mass of highly injected blood- vessels, the colour of which was not that of congestion so much as of inflammation, approaching to scarlet. The medullary structure of the brain presented, when sliced, a number of bloody points. There was nothing particular in the lateral ventricles, except that the plexus choroides were very large, and of a dark reddish-brown colour. The cerebellum presented nothing remarkable, excepting a high degree of vascularity, like the cerebrum. The vessels of the dura and pia mater were every where highly injected. The theca vertebralis wa.s vascu- lar, and, upon lowering the head, an ounce of scrum ran from the sheath within the vertebral column. Neck and Ann.—'Fhe va.sa vasoriim of the carotid artery were rather tinged. The par vagum manifested a general blush of inflammation, the .sheath of the nerve was injected with bl(K)d-

stomach and intestines. 275 OF THE SYMPTOMS. The symptoms vary in their degree and duration. On some occasions, the cramp begins in the extremities of the body, and at length attacks the stomach, but on others, it is limited to the stomach and parietes of the abdomen. The cramp of the stomach is a very fminful anti alarming dis- order, when it occurs within tliree weeks after delivery *• It is accompanied by sense of twisting in the affected part, by small, contracted, and irregular pulse, and coltl extremities; and difficult breathing, and a hard tumour is felt in the seat of the stomach, if the recti muscles be not spasmodically contractetl. Cramp in the stomach is st^metimes connected with hernia at the navel. I had occasion some years ago to visit an old fat lady, who had been, during the greater part of her life, the victim of dyspepsia, and of occasional .severe attacks of crump in that organ, which were friTiuently relievixl by large doses ol lau- danum, and the application of a blister to tlu: stomach. There was no very obvious external tumour at the navel, as the her- nial swelling, which protruded a little l>eyond the peritoneum, was buried and concealctl in the subcutaneous fat. In my opi- nion, this patient’s death was rather to be imputed to an effusion of a small quantity of a serous fluid l>etween the membranes, and into the ventricles of the brain, than to the hernia, the con- tents of which did not exhibit the usual symptoms of strangu- lation. No morbid appearance could be discovered in the stomach, excepting a small patch of lymph on its smaller curvature. The symptoms in many cases come on in distinct paroxysms, ; and the respirations are sometimes short and interrupted, owing to spasm of the diaphragm. The spasm is sometimes followed by haemateniesis, gastritis, i or laceration of the raucous membrane of the stomach. * Vide Bums’ Midwifery, p. 498, 7th edition.

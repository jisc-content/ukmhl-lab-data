88 or MOllTIFICATION initlng. The skin is dry, and the patient thirsty, and much flushed. If a clyster be thrown up, it only empties the contents of the intestines beneath the stricture. The pain in the tumour becomes very acute ; some patients compare their sufferings to burning at the region of the stomach and navel. The vomiting becomes still more urgent, and not only the contents of the stomach, but even those of the intestines, are re- jected. I have even seen faeces thus discharged. After some hours hiccough follows, the tension of the belly goes off, the belly subsides, and the pulse, which had been very hard and full, becomes so small' and quick as to be counted with difficulty; the breathing laborious; the body is covered by a cold clammy sweat, the extremities become cold, the eyes have a glassy and languid look: the hernial tumour crackles when pressed; and when in this state, its contents, in many in- stances, spontaneously return into the abdomen, or upon slight pressure, which is followed by a discharge of faeces. These symptoms are the preludes to delirium, convulsions, and death â™¦. The symptoms occasioned by a protrusion of the omentum aie sometimes similar to those occasioned by a strangulated^por- tion of intestine, though generally milder.

Of Hcrnice, when Gangrene has supervened. If the patient survive the inflammation excited by the stran- gulation of the intestines, mortification follows. * London, 182C.

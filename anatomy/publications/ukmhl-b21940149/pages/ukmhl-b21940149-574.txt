OF H^MENTERIA AND FUNGUS 518 SECTION VIII. OSSIFICATION OF THE PERITONEUM. Ossification of serous membranes is not unfrequent, and especially that of the arachnoid, pleura, and pericardium. It seldom occurs that serous membranes are actually converted into bone, but the osseous matter is deposited on them as the remote consequence of inflammatory action. It may be a ques- tion whether coagulable lymph becomes gradually firm, dense, cartilaginous, and ultimately osseous. The ossification probably is the efiect of chronic inflamma- tion, as we observe such ossifications of the vaginal coat in some cases of long continued hydrocele. Small cartilaginous excrescences are attached sometimes to serous membranes; these have been supposed to be the pre- ludes of ossification, but of the truth of this opinion I am very doubtful. Numerous cartilaginous tumours are frequently found be- neath the peritoneum of the uterus; these often become par- tially or completely ossified in advanced life. SECTION IX. ' DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FROM THE PERITONEUM, CALLED HiEMENTERIA. A niscHAiiGK of blood into the cavity of the peritoneum is not very rare; and, as already stated, is often combined with inflammation, and, according to Dr Duncan, sometimes with sea-scurvy.

( 59 ) CLASS II. DISEASES CONNECTED WITH A DISPLACEMENT OF A POIITION OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. SECTION 1. OK 1NTU8-SU8CKPT10. A PORTION of intestine sometimes passes within another, car- rying along with it its mesentery ; the intestine is then in a state of intus-susceptio : and this proves a cause of considerable stric- ture, the included intestine being in a contracted state. It has been stated that the internal coat ’of the intestine is .sometimes invaginated, and forms a complete barrier to the pas- sage of the alimentary canal, but this I never have observed. The intestine pa.s9es generally into that immetliately lK*ncath it, and sometimes in the reverse manner. The frequency of the first species may lie readily explained from the natural jx*ristaltic motion of the intestines, whereas the latter can happen only when the peristaltic motion of the intes- tine is inverted. A part of the intestine ha.s been statetl to fall within another, tnerely on account of its weight; but the case of intus-susceptio from below upwards, sufficiently refutes such a theory. ‘ An intus-susceptio is not peculiar to any one period of life.- It is much more common during infancy than in manhood. During infancy, the included portion of intestine may, in most instances, be readily disengaged, there being no unnatural thickening, inflammation, or adhesion between the contained and containing bowclj and but a slight diminution in the calibre of the intestinal canal. In the infant, it is not' uncommon to meet with three, four,

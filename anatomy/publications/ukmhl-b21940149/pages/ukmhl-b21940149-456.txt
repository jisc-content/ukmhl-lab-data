OF Alll ACCUMULATED WITHIN THE 408 they were small tubercles of the mucx)us membrane, with fissures in them. Professor Horner of Philadelphia lately was so polite as to send me a pamphlet, entitled “ An Inquiry into the Anato- mical Characters of Infantile Follicular Inflammation of the Gastro-Intestinal Mucous Membrane, and into the probable identity with Cholera Infantum.” In the engraving appended to this essay, the mucous follicles of the intestines are represent- ed as much enlarged. SECTION XIV. OF DISEASED SECEETIONS FROM THE MUCOUS I^IEM- BRANES, WITHOUT ANY ORGANIC LESION. An attempt to describe all the diseased secretions of the mu- cous membrane is foreign to the object of this work. - It is my intention to limit my observations to the accumu- lation of air, and to the generation of an acid, and of a bilious looking fluid, within the alimentary canal. The stomach and intestines are frequently very much dis- tended with air, and this air is probably derived from different sources. Part of it is swallowed along with the food, pait is probably secreted, and part is formed by a process resem- bling fermentation, which sometimes takes place in the stomach, when the digestive powers are weak. The accumulation of air is sometimes so considerable, that it has been described under the name Mctcorismus^ or Tympa- nitea intestinalia. Air is also effused in consequence of perfo- ration of the intestinal tube; and this has been called Tympa- nites abdominalis. . These two species of tympany may generally be distin- guished from each other. The abdominal tympany commences

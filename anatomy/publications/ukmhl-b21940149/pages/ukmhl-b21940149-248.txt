20-A BLOODVESSELS, ABSORBENTS, &C. are only two or three such excrescences from the parent hyda- tid. Upon examining the coats of \ery large hydatids, even with- out the aid of a magnifying glass, very small hydatids may be seen adhering to the coats of the hydatid, which would seem to show that hydatids are multiplied in the same manner as some of the fungi of the vegetable kingdom. Bloodvessels, Ahsorhents, and Nerves of Hydatids. The coats of hydatids are provided with very small blood- vessels, absorbents, and nerves. The bloodvessels proper to the coats of the hydatid, have no immediate connection with those of the organ within which it is lodged: the hydatid, in this respect, resembles a worm lodged within the human body. I have, in several instances, filled, with great success, the bloodvessels of the organ within which hydatids were lodged; also those upon the sac of the hydatid; which, where the hyda- tid is of considerable bulk, are of a larger size, and which, like those in the neighbourhood of other preternatural tumours, ac- quire an unusual size. None of the injection got into the vessels of the coats of the hydatid. But other authors have affirmed, that they had injected the vessels proper to the hy- datid. Watery vesicles, or Dropsical Cysts, as they have been named by some authors, are very different from hydatids, for in these we observe only a single thin coat, firmly attached to the neigh- bouring parts, upon which several bloodvessels, filled by red blood, may be observed. Such cysts frequently adhere to the extremities of the Fallo- pian tubes, to the ligaments of the uterus, to the choroid plexus, to the placenta, kidneys, or are, sometimes lodged within the glandular viscera, and are also sometimes imbedded in the mam- ma! and testicle. I have seen them filled by a fluid of the

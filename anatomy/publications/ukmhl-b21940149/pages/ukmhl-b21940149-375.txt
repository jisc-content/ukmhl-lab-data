It is foreign to the object of a work of tins kind, to enter into tletail concerning the effects of various poisons. I propose, therefore, to confine my observations within very narrow limits, ami to enumerate only the effects of a few of those articles which have been sometimes swallowed by accident, or taken with tlic view of committing suicide. Notwithstanding the very disagreeable taste, and very cor- rosive nature of the sulphuric and nitric acids, they have some- times been swallowed by accident, and also very frequently been employed with the view of self-destruction.

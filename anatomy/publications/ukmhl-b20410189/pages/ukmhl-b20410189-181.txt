In that the trabecular cranii first diverge and then con- verge, meet, and so enclose what becomes the pituitary space, we find a temporary condition of which large traces remain even in adult Ophidians, where the cartilaginous trabecular persist as two rods, one on each side of the para-sphenoid.

Before the development of the third visceral arch we have I the permanent condition of the Lamprey, which is always destitute of a mandible; and when, in man, the visceral arches ! successively arise, we have transitorily represented the piscine condition, where the solid axes of seven or more such arches form the mandible, the hyoidean arch, and the successive I branchial or gill-bearing arches. ! In the development of the palatal, or second visceral arch, there is sketched out a condition permanent in Sharks, where the lower jaws bite against a cartilaginous pterygo-palatine ; arcade which takes the place of an as yet undeveloped bony upper jaw. This condition is essentially similar to the struc- ture of the Sturgeon, where a comparatively minute pair ot ! jaws (mandibular and pterygo-palatine respectively) are suspended at the end of a disproportionately large suspen- sorial structure. In that stage of the human skull which precedes ossification I we have a reminder of the exclusively cartilaginous structure of certain Fishes. In the distinct ossific origin of the elements of the petrous

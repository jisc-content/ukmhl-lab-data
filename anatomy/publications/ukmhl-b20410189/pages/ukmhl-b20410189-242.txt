ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. 200 Instead of being free as in man, the tibia may anchylose at each end with the corresponding extremities of the fibula, as is the case in the Armadillos and often in the Seals. Very often it anchyloses with the fibula below only, as in the Rabbit and in some Birds, e.g. Adjutant and Ostrich (and as in one member of man's own order, Tar sins) ; or above only, as, at least sometimes, in the Cape Ant-eater. There may be an apparently single representative of the two bones of the leg which are completely fused together, ar in the Frog.

The tibia may be the only long bone of the leg, through the small development of the fibula, as is the case in Rumi- nants and in the Horse tribe.

27 THE SPINAL SKELETON. The first of these two masses, termed the sacrum, comes immediately beneath the lumbar vertebrae, and affords attach- ment on each side to one of the haunch, or hip, bones. Five or six sacral vertebrae coalesce to form the sacrum. The second and much smaller bony mass, termed the coccyx,1 is made up of three or four small and imperfect vertebrae, named coccygeal. 8. Before proceeding to consider more carefully the different vertebrae, a DORSAL vertebra may first be described as a type. Fig. 39.—A Dorsal Vertebra'. c, centrum ; s, neural spine; d, tubercular or transverse process; capitular process, or articular surface for the head of a rib ; small articular surface for part of the head of the succeeding rib; z, upper articular process, or prezygapophysis ; z, lower articular process, or postzygapophysis. From each outer angle of the posterior surface of its centrum there springs a pier of the neural arch. Each of these two piers is termed a pedicle. From the hinder end of each pedicle a flat plate of bone projects backwards and towards the middle line, till the two plates meet and thus complete the neural arch. Each such plate is termed a " lamina " or neural lamina. At the point of junction of the laminae a single median process runs backwards and downwards. This is the spinous process, or neural spine? From the junction of each lamina with its pedicle another process, ending bluntly, juts outwards and backwards. This is called the transverse process, and there are two to every dorsal vertebra. From the upper and outer part of each lamina a small process projects upwards, with a smooth surface on it which 1 From its fancied resemblance to a cuckoo's beak— kokkvI-, a cuckoo. v Sometimes neurapophysis, from vevpov, a nerve, and a.it6<pv<ri£, a process.

i44 [less. ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. and mastoidal portions of the temporal bone we have a transitory representation of the permanent conditions of the same parts in the osseous Fishes. In the distinct osseous origins of the wings of the sphenoid, of the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid, and of the lateral parts of the occipital bone, there is exhibited a resemblance to the permanent condition of those parts as they exist in many animals, as has been already noticed. Fig. 122.â€” Side View of the Cartilaginous Skeleton of the Head of a Shark This shows the successive arches except the first pair, or trabecule? cranii, which form the base of the skull in front of the pituitary fossa. Pq, pterygopalatine, or second arch ; mandibular, or third arch ; //, hyoidean, or fourth arch (the corniculum, stylo-hyoid ligament, styloid process, &c . ot man) From behind it the branchiostegal rays are seen extending backwards, 61 to 65, the branchial arches forming the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth arches of the skull. The same remark applies to the other parts which, at first distinct, ultimately coalesce, such as the portions of the ethmoid, the upper maxillary bones, the pterygoid processes, and the squamous element of the temporal bone. Finally, that exceptional anchylosis which occasionally takes place in aged skulls recalls to us that union of the cranial elements which in some Vertebrates, as in Birds, is so much more complete than is normally the case with the bones constituting the human cranium. The consideration of the relations existing between Meckel's cartilage and the summit of the hyoidean arch in man with the suspensorial and mandibular structures of lower Verte- brates, must be deferred until the internal ear is treated of, and we come to examine the essential nature of its auditory ossicles.

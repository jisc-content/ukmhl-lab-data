72 ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY. [less. there may be two distinct series of ribs on each side of the body, one series being dorsally situate with regard to the other. This condition is found in many Fishes, as e.g. the Tunny and Polyplerus^ and in the latter some vertebrae have four ribs on each side springing from the doubled transverse process before noticed (Fig. 52). 36. That mode of development of the vertebral column which we have seen to take place in man, takes place also, broadly speaking, in all Vertebrates ; only the process is arrested at different stages in different forms. Thus the notochord may, as we have seen, persist, or the ossification of the vertebras break off at various stages, leaving a great deal or only a rudiment of the notochord persisting. The process of consolidation and union may proceed only so far as to leave transverse processes distinct, e.g. the Carp, or neurapophyses in two or four pieces, and separate from the neural spines, as before noted. Finally, not only may vertebras be found denser than those of man, as the vertebrae of Serpents, but coalescence may extend to adjacent vertebrae in the several ways already described. Our survey shows us that the backbone alone, without the help of any limb, may serve as an organ for creeping over the ground or swimming through water, for climbing trees, for crushing prey as in the Boa Constrictor, and even as a hand to present food to the mouth as also in the Boa, or to grasp and bring near small detached objects, as is done by the tail of the Spider Monkey.

An exceptional structure which probably belongs to the same skeletal category as the ribs and sternum may here be mentioned. This is the cartilaginous "basket" which supports the gills in the Lamprey. It consists of arcs of cartilage

IOO ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMK [less. Generally, as in man, the two parietals meet, but, as has been said in treating of the occipital, they may be encroached upon, and depressed to the side of the skull (as in the Cetacea), by the union of the last-named bone with the frontal. The great size of the parietals of man is very exceptional, and has direct relation to the immense development of his brain. On the other hand, they may be in great part mere bars, as in many Lizards. The parietal may give of! a lamellar expansion helping to roof over the temporal fossa—as in the Turtie and the curious African Rodent Lophiomys. The exclusion of the parietal from any junction with the sphenoid by that of the frontal bone with the temporal, which occasionally occurs in man, is very common in Apes. On the contrary, it may extend to join not only the greater but also the less, or orbital, wing of the sphenoid. The parietal may be one with the frontal, forming a franto- parietal bone, as in the Frog and Lepidosirem Fig 97—Upper Surface of the Skull of a Frog. {After Parker.) e, os en ceinture, or girdle-bone ; eo, exoccipital; f, frontal part of fronto- parietal bone; m.v, maxillary bone; n, nasal ; op, opistbotic: parietal part of fronto-parietal bone ; pre-maxilla; po, pro-otic ; pt, pterygoid ; g, quadrato-jugal; sq, squamosal ; sus, suspensorium of lower jaw. From within the parietal an ossified falx may extend into the cranial cavity, as in the Ornithorhynchus, while the junc- tion of the parietals may be extended upwards into a large sagittal crest, as in many Carnivora, and even in the Gorilla.

Again, in Saccobranchus and Amphi-1 pnous, we find, by a very remarkable exception, a long I lung-like sac (with a highly vascular internal surface) 1 placed on each side of the body, and communicating with] the mouth by an aperture placed between the first branchial j] arch and the hyoid. These organs receive blood from the J aortic vessels coming from the heart, and transmit it to the | dorsal aorta. There may be six or seven branchial sacs, as in the Sharks Hexanchus and Heptanchus, On the contrary, not only may; the fifth branchial arch be devoid of a gill, as in all the Teleostei, but even the fourth gill may disappear, and indeed only thel second gill may be left, as in Amphipnons. Sometimes, as in Lepidosteus and the Sharks, the hyoideanj arch also supports a gill.

Fishes teach us that teeth may be developed in yet other I situations, for in some of those animals {e.g. the Salmon and ' Odontoglossum), there are teeth upon the tongue ; and in I most Fishes teeth are developed at the extreme back of the mouth, on the bones of those arches (branchial arches) ! which represent permanently what have been spoken of in i the First Lesson as the transitory posterior visceral arches of the early stages of human development. The branchial I arches of Fishes which support the gills, and are placed on ! each side beneath the back of the head, sometimes (as in t the Perch), develop tooth-like bodies on their inner surfaces, \ and the hinder of these lateral arches terminate (Fig. 114) : in bones called pharyngeal,1 which most frequently support ; teeth (sometimes of very complex structure, as in Scarus), termed from their situation pharyngeal teeth. Moreover, the exactly reverse conditions to those which obtain in man may be met with, as in the Carp and Tench, where the Fig. 222.â€”Pharynx of a Tench opened from below, and the two rows OF PHARYNGEAL TEETH DIVARICATED. (AfterOwen.) b, basi-occipital tooth ; ph, pharyngeal teeth ; o, oesophagus. margins of the jaws are as free from teeth as is man's throat, while the posterior aperture of the mouth is bounded by teeth, partly pharyngeal, and in part attached to a prolonga- tion downwards of the hindmost bone of the base of the skull! We shall see that tooth-like tissue may be developed in still more anomalous situations, but as some of the structures referred to cannot be called teeth, and others can only doubt- fully be so called, notice of them may be postponed. 22. As to implantation, the changes which take place in 1 From being placed in the "pharynx." For this see Lesson XI.

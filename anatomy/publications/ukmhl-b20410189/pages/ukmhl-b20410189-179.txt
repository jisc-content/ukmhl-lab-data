Fig. 120.â€”A section of the Cranium of a full-grown African Elephant, taken to the left of a middle line, and including the vomer (Vo), and the mesethmoid (ME) ; an, anterior, and pn, posterior narial aperture, i2. This section shows the enormous thickness of the skull wall, and the prodigious development of air-cells in the frontal above and in front of the cerebral cavity, and above and behind the anterior nares, an. (From Flower s " Osteology.") In Birds also they may be well developed, while, on the contrary, an extraordinarily dense projection of bone may take place from the frontals, as in the Cassowary. Frontal sinuses may be entirely wanting, as in many Mammals and Reptiles, and as in the Frog, and this though other cranial elements have large air-cavities, as in the Crocodile. The sphenoidal sinuses may be much less developed than in man, as is the case in common Monkeys and many Mam- mals, e.g. the Sheep and Manatee. They may, however, be very greatly developed and extend into the median plate of the ethmoid, as in the Elephant. Similarly, in oviparous

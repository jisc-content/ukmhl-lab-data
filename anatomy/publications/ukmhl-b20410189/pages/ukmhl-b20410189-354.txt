The temporal muscle of man is but very poorly developed compared with what we find in many other forms, such as the Tiger. It may, on the contrary, be less developed relatively than in man, as in the Hare. It may be divided into three or four portions, as in the Fowl and Goose.

A A, adductor arcuum; B, biceps; CA, constrictor arcuum; CF, constiictor faucium; D, deltoid ; J?1, digastric ; EL, extensor longus; ExO, external oblique; LA, levator arcuum; LD, latissimus dorsi; M, masseter; MHl. anterior pai. of mylo-hyoid ; MH2, posterior part of mylo-hyoid ; S, sub- c.avius ; SL, supinator longus ; T, trapezius ; T, triceps ; [f, ulnaris. The pterygoid muscles of man are essentially similar to the same parts in the whole of his class ; but these muscles may be indistinguishably united into one, as in Menopoma, or even with the temporal, as in Menobranchus (Fig. 286). They may be very large, as in venomous Serpents. 16. The orbital muscles of man present a condition which is normal, these parts exhibiting a remarkable con- stancy in vertebrate animals. Such parts, however, may be entirely wanting even in

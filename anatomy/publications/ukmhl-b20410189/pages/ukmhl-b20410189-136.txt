[less. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. The hinder end of the basi-occipital has a more important function in the Sauropsida than in mans class, as it develops a convex projecting head or condyle, which articulates with the vertebral column. In most Fishes it is concave, its con- cavity being applied to the concavity of the body of the first vertebra in the same way that all the bi-concave vertebrae are united together.

The lateral parts {exoccipitals) are constantly ossified where ever the skull is ossified at all; and their position wit regard to the spinal marrow is constant. They always transmit, either as in man by a notch, or by a foramen, the eighth pair of nerves, and also the hypoglossal nerve where it exists, but this latter is wanting in Fishes. In the fact that the occipital condyles a*-e mainly f ^rmed by the lateral parts (exoccipitals), man agrees with his own class. They may, however, be entirely formed by the ex- occipitals, as in Batrachians ; or these bones may more or less help to form one single median convex articular condyle, as in the Sauropsida. The peculiarities as to the position of the foramen magnum will be spoken of in considering the skull as a whole. The Squama of man, or supra-occipital, is of a relative size greatly in excess of that which exists in most forms, but still it may attain a yet greater importance than in him. This is the case, for example, in the Cetacea and in the Elephant, where its relative as well as absolute size is enormous.

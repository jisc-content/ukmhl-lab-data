187 SKELETON OF LOWER LLMB. v.] The first metatarsal has its proximal, concave, articular surface at right angles with the axis of its shaft. The second metatarsal is the longest. The fifth metatarsal has its base greatly enlarged, with a considerable prominence, or " tuberosity," projecting from the outer side of its hinder end. 8. The phalanges are three in number in each digit, except the first, or great toe (hallux), which has but two. These two, however, are much larger than those of the other toes. Often the second and third phalanges of the fifth digit (or little toe) become anchylosed together. The second phalanges are much shorter than the first, and the third phalanges are slightly shorter than the second. Each last phalanx has its end modified to support a nail, much as we saw in the last phalanges of the hand. The toes being so 'much shorter than the fingers, the phalanges are of course also much shorter. 9. Comparing now the relations presented by OTHER animals, we find that man follows a rule which is universal in having the leg-bones attached to and suspended from a pelvis (well developed or rudimentary), which may be looked upon as the root-portion of the limb. This root part may, however, be present while the distal part (leg and foot) is more or less atrophied, but the distal parts are never present without a rudiment of the limb-root. The bones of the inferior extremity of man are of full it.

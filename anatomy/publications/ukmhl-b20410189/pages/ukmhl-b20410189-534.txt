[less. 484 ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. This organ may be relatively much larger than in man, and consist of two lobes, as in the Ornithorhynchus ; it may consist of three lobes, as in the Echidna. Occasionally in Rodents a small detached accessory spleen may be developed, and there are constantly accessory spleens in the Sturgeon, the Dolphin, and Narwhal. Fig. 408. â€”The Spleen (Spi.) with the splenic artery (SpA\ Below this latter is seen the splenic vein running to help to form the vena portce (VP). Ao, the aorta ; D, a pillar of the diaphragm ; PD, the pancreatic duct exposed by dissection in the substance of the pancreas ; Dm, duodenum ; BD, the biliary! duct opening into the pancreatic duct at x ; y, the intestinal vessels. 13. The thyroid gland of man is a soft, reddish, and very vascular body, embracing the trachea in front, and ascending to the larynx. It has no duct, and is of a more or less semilunar form, with two lateral lobes, united by an isthmus. It is covered by the sterno-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles. In that man develops a thyroid gland he appears to agree with all Vertebrates except the Lancelet. This body may consist of two completely divided lateral halves, placed each on one side of the trachea and larynx, as in Birds; Batrachians, Monitors, the Llama, the Otter, the Mole, and others, and as even in the Orang. It may consist of one undivided body, as in Cetaceans. It may be represented (as in Birds) by small rounded or elongated bodies, very vascular, placed beside the trachea, above the syrinx, and closely connected with the carotid or

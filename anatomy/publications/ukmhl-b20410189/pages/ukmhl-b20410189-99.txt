II.] 6S THE SPINAL SKELETON and Toads we have a middle and xiphoid sternum, as also in many Reptiles, and we have all three (as before said) in some Reptiles {e.g. the Crocodile and Chameleon) and in Birds. The manubrium forms a much larger part of the sternum in some members of man's class than it does in him, as is the case in the Cetacea, the Monotremes, and in the Mole, where its re- lative length about equals that of all the rest of the sternum. On the other hand, it may be remarkably small and narrow, as in the Pig and the Horse. Fig. 75â€”Sternum of the Pig (Sus scrofa). f>s, manubrium, or pre-sternum ; ms, middle part of the sternum, or meso- sternum ; xs, xiphisternum. {From Professor Flower's " Osteology") Sometimes this part may develop a strong median keel for muscular attachment, as in Bats, the Mole, and Armadillos. This keel, however, does not answer to the keel of Birds, which belongs to the more post-axial part of the sternum. The " episternal granules " occasionally present in man are replaced in some Mammals by considerable horn-like pro- cesses, as in the Howling Monkeys (Mycetes) and Mice. The manubrium may be remarkably small when coexisting with a sternum hypertrophied in other parts, as in Birds.

Thus, if the whole organ be vertically bisected in the line of the longitudinal fissure, we find as follows: — The inner surface of the cerebral hemisphere in view is Fig. 325. —Side View of the Brain and Upper Part of the Spinal Marrow in place, the parts which cover the cerebro spinal centres being removed. a, front part of atlas vertebra applied to the odontoid process {o) behind it ; 6, body of third cervical vertebra ; c> cerebrum —the long continuous groove imme- diately above the convolution to which the letters points, is the Sylvian jisstire, while the convolution itself forms part of the temporal lobe of the cerebrum ; cb, cerebellum : medulla oblongata ; p, pons Varolii; s, arch of skull cut through ; s, spinous process of axis vertebra. very much convoluted, and the cerebrum may be seen to extend beyond the olfactory lobe in front and beyond the cerebellum behind. Beneath the middle of the cerebrum we come to the cut surface of the corpus callosum, the front part of which bends sharply backwards and downwards, forming what is called the knee (genii). Beneath the bent-back extremity of the corpus callosum is the cut edge of the lamina cinerea (or terminalis). At the upper part of this lamina we find the cut surface of a transversely-extending white cord, called the anterior co?nmissure, and immediately behind the lamina we find another cord, part of what is called the fornix. This latter structure extends, not transversely, but at first upwards and forwards, afterwards curving backwards it passes to the hinder part of the corpus callosum. Filling up the space between the corpus callosum and fornix is a delicate membrane called the septum Incidum. Below the fornix we have evidently cut into a cavity ex-

In Birds (where the fifth digit is never developed) the numbers of the phalanges of the four digits, proceeding from the hallux, are mostly 2, 3, 4, 5; but they may be 2, 3, 3, 3, as in the Swifts, or 2, 3, 4, 3, as in the Goatsuckers. It is by the number of their pha- langes (4 and 5) that the two digits of the Ostrich are known to answer to the fourth and fifth digits of other Sauropsidans i {e.g. Lizards) which have all five digits developed.

The terminal phalanges may bifurcate, as in the short-tailed jPangolin, or develop a fold of bone to support the claw, as lin Cats and Edentates, e.g. the Sloths.

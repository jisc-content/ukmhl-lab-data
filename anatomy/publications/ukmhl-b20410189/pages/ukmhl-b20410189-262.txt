In man, as in most Vertebrates, the superimposed pairs of these two series of parts are completely united, except at their root, but a wider examination shows their probable essential duplicity, and makes visible relations and a significance in the transverse process of his thoracic and cervical vertebrae, which no study of anthropotomy, however patient and minute, could of itself reveal. 10. Still less would it, from such study, be possible to divine the nature of that hardly noticeable ridge which extends along the middle of the body of his axis vertebra on its ventral aspect; yet that ridge is really a rudiment of a system of parts hardly less conspicuous and important in the verte- brate skeleton than the two series already noticed. It may be remembered, however, that in some Mammals {e.g. the Ornithorhynchus) a median spinous process projects downwards from beneath the centrum of the cervical verte- brae as also the great development of such processes (hypa- pophyses) in poisonous Serpents, and their extension through the greater part of the whole vertebral column. We have also seen how such median structures are directly in series with and answer to processes descending in pairs, or to forked processes, which start from a common bony stalk ; also that arches (chevron bones) of similar nature may attain a very large size, as in the tails of Whales and Por- poises. Finally, we have seen that a still more important and con- spicuous part may be played by the same skeletal elements, as in some Fishes {e.%. the Sole), where elongated arches and 1 From did, through. 2 Ilapd, beside.

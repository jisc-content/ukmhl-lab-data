In the preponderating size of the lumbar vertebra man but exaggerates a character generally present in his class, but this preponderance is not universal, as is shown by Bats. Lumbar vertebrae are generally to be distinguished in 1 Mammals, and in Crocodiles and certain Lizards; but not in ;any Ichthyopsidan. In Birds, lumbar vertebrae are present indeed, but disguised I and hidden by exaggeration of the sacral anchylosis. I The number in man is below the average of his class, I though some Apes have but four, the Two-toed Sloth but I three, and the Monotremes but two. The largest number in quadrupeds is eight, or sometimes nine, found in the Slow Lemur—which is very remarkable, as in that beast there are also sixteen dorsal vertebrae. There may indeed be as many as twenty-four lumbar, as in the ! Dolphins, though the limits of the region are somewhat in- I determinate in those animals. The spinous and transverse processes of the lumbar verte- brae are shorter relatively in man than in most Mammals, which also have them generally directed towards the head. The lumbar transverse processes may be excessively pro- longed, as in Cetaceans, and the last ones may articulate or janchylose with the sacrum, as in the Horse.

The metapophyses and anapophyses attain their greatest length in the lumbar region : thus in the Armadillos the former processes equal the spinous processes in length, and E 2

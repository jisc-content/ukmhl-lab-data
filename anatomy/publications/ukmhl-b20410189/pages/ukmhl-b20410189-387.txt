VIII.] THE MUSCLES. 343 The obturator externus is also a constant muscle both as to existence and position, being found even in the Frog. peculiar sort of additional external obturator (but with an anomalous internal origin) may exist, as in the Hyrax, where a third obturator springs from the inner surface of the ischium, close to its junction with the pubes, and which, passing through the obturator foramen, is inserted into the trochan- teric fossa in common with the obturator externus (Fig. 308).

Tensor vagina femoris. This may be altogether wanting, as in the true Opossums. It may, on the contrary, be very largely developed, as in the Seals (where it arises from the panniculus carnosus and external oblique) and in the Horse. It may be more or less blended with the gluteus maximus, as in Agouti. Sartorius. This muscle is generally present in Mammals, though it may be altogether wanting, as in Bats. Its origin and insertion may both differ considerably from what we find to exist in man. Thus, in the Agouti it arises from the ilio-pectineal eminence and the pubic symphysis. It may have two heads (one on each side of the tendon of the psoas magnus), as in the Horse. It may be confounded above with the tendon of the long extensor of the thigh, as in Ruminants. It may arise, as in the Three-toed Sloth, from the lower part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and then divide into two parts—one of these being inserted into the femur, the other again subdividing and

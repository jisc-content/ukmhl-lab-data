I have endeavoured, secondly, by certain additions and by the mode of treatment, to fit them for students in medicine and generally for those acquainted with human anatomy, but desirous of learning its more significant relations to the structures of other animals. . . My hope is that this little volume may thus serve as a handbook of Human Morphology. Man has been selected as the type, because his structure has been the most studied and is the most intimately known, as also because our own frame is naturally the most interest- ing to ourselves.

SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. v.] 199 shows a predominance of size, like that of the radius in the arm over the ulna, and this to a yet greater degree. Thus while, like the radius, it never aborts though its fellow may do so, it never in existing animals even becomes the subordi- nate bone of the two, as is the case in the radius compared with the ulna in Birds. Yet in length it may be exceeded by the fibula, as e.g. in the Ornithorhynchus; and a certain slight subordination appears to have existed in the extinct Reptiles Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus. Moreover, the two bones are developed equally in certain existing Reptiles with rudi- mentary limbs, e.g. Seps and Qphiodes^ and in Batrachians also. In its elongated figure the tibia of man agrees with the same bone as generally developed, and it never becomes in any existing species so relatively short and thick above as does the radius in Cetacea. Such is the case only in the extinct Plesiosaurus and Ichthyosaurus. The relation which it bears to the femur is less constant than that wThich the radius bears to the humerus. We have seen that where in Vertebrates above Fishes the humerus is Fig. 170.â€”Side View of Bones of Posterior Extremity of Greenland Right Whale {Balcena mysticetus). z, ischium ; f, femur ; t, accessory ossicle, probably representing the tibia. {From Eschricht and Reinhardt.) represented by a bone or cartilage, the radius is also developed. But in Megaptera longimana and Balcenoptera musculus we have a rudimentary representative of the femur, but none whatever of the tibia ; while in Balcena mysticetus and in Boa constrictor there is a tolerably large ossicle representing the femur, but only a minute rudiment representing the tibia.

III.] 75 THE CRANIAL SKELETON the brain and spinal marrow are connected and become continuous through this occipital foramen. If the skull be turned base upwards, a strong bluntly pointed prominence will be seen to project from each outer margin on a line passing from right to left through the occi- pital condyles. The prominence is called, from its shape, the mastoid 1 process.

The under surface of the face (formed by the bones of the roof of the mouth) lies at a different level from that of the base of the skull proper. Connecting these two surfaces there are on each side a pair of vertical bony plates termed * From ixaaiog, a nipple.

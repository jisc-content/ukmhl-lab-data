ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [LESS. 472 Each of the two lower processes of the posterior margins ot the thyroid articulates- with the side of the cartilage next to be described. This latter, the cricoid1 cartilage, forms a complete ring, deepest behind (where the thyroid is open), placed beneath the thyroid cartilage, and forming the uppermost ring of the trachea, with both of which parts it is connected by mem- brane. The arytenoid2 cartilages are two in number, placed side by side, at a little distance from each other, on the posterior Fig. 398.â€”Diagram of the Larynx, the thyroid cartilage being supposed to he transparent, and allowing the right arytenoid cartilage (Ar), vocal ligament (V% and thyro-arytenoid muscle(TkA), the upper part of the cricoid cartilage (Cr), and the attachment of the epiglottis (Ep) to be seen. C th, the right crico- thyroid muscle; 7V, the trachea ; Hyy the hyoid bone. and highest part of the cricoid cartilage. Each arytenoid cartilage is pyramidal in form, and at the apex of each is placed an additional and minute cartilage, called that of Santorini. The epiglottis* is a median, azygos cartilage, shaped somewhat like a leaf, placed in front of the upper opening of the larynx within the thyroid cartilage and the cornua of the hyoid. It ends in a narrow termination below, where it is attached by ligament to the depression at the front part of the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage. 1 From npUoc, a ring, and cldog. 2 From upi'/T.ui/a, a sort of pitcher, and cl?> >r. 3 From hiti, upon, and yXwrrlg, the aperture of the windpipe.

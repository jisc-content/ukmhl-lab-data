[LESS. 420 ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOM Y. Thus they may all arise from the aorta in common as one great trunk, subsequently dividing, as in the Ox ; or the left carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries may all arise sepa- rately from the aorta, as in the Dugong ; or both common carotids may take origin in one trunk with the right sub- clavian, as in the Lion; or there may be two innominate arteries, each dividing into subclavian and carotid, as m the Hedgehog.

Rathke.) a> a, internal carotids ; b, b, external carotids ; c, c; common carotids ; d, root of main aortic arch (here right); <?, arch of the same ; f, right sub- clavian (which arises from the ana- stomosis of the first two right primi- tive aortic arches); g, commencement of the descending aorta; h, h, left subclavian ; z, 2", z, pulmonary arte- ries ; ky right, and /, left, rudiments of the primitive aortic arches,— Nos. 5, 5, of Fig 358.

The two common carotids may ascend in close juxta- position, as in Birds, and one of them may be much reduced in size, or even abort. The vertebral artery, instead of passing through the cer- vical transverse processes, may perforate the neural laminae, as in the Llamas. The internal carotid may break up (inside the skull) into a network of small arteries (called a rete mirabile), as e.g. in the Ox.

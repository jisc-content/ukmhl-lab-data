SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. LESSON IV. THE SKELETON OF THE UPPER LIMB. 1. The bones of man's upper limb are divisible into three categories : A. Those of the shoulder ; B. Those of the arm ; and C. Those of the hand. A. Those of the shoulder are the blade-bone, called the scapula, and the collar-bone, called the clavicle.1 B. Those of the arm are subdivisible into (a) the upper arm, and (6) the fore-arm. (a) In the upper arm there is but a single bone, called the humerus. (b) In the fore-arm there are two long bones placed side by side, and called the radius and the ulna. C. Those of the hand are divisible into the bones of the wrist (or the carpus*), those of the middle, solid part of the hand, called the metacarpus? and those of the fingers (or digits), which are called phalanges.* 2. The SCAPULA is a flat, triangular bone, with three borders and two surfaces. One of these surfaces is applied against the ribs, and is concave. It is called the subscapular fossa. The shortest of its three borders is uppermost. The other (dorsal or outer) surface is divided obliquely into two unequal parts by a prominent ridge, called the "spine," on which account the part above the ridge is termed the supraspinous fossa, and the part below it the infra- spinous fossa. This spine becomes gradually more prominent from the vertebral border of the scapula, while at its outer end it expands into a large freely projecting process termed the 1 Clams, a key. 2 From Kapnog. the wrist. 3 From jueTa, after, and Kapitog. 4 <fcÂ«/\a->f, anything set in array.

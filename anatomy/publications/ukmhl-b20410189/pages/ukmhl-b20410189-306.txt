[less. exceeded by what we find in certain of the Hog tribe, e.g. in the Babyrussa (Porcus), where the upper canines first mount vertically and then curve over backwards and downwards, whence its native name, which signifies Deer-Hog. Undoubted canines attain their maximum in the upper jaw of the Walrus, which develops a pair of enor- mous descending tusks growing from permanent pulps, and which are said to aid the animal in its locomotion amongst the ice. Fig. 233.-Skui.i, and The longest tooth developed in the Tusks of the Babyrussa whole animal kingdom is the tusk of the {Parens). Narwhal. It may be doubted, indeed, whether this tooth represents a canine or a molar, yet, as it is embedded entirely in the maxilla, it cannot be an incisor. In the female Narwhal these teeth remain undeveloped and in the bone. In the male the tooth of one side is generally developed, but sometimes both are so. The pulp cavity extends nearly the whole extent of the enormous tooth, which is said to attain a length of ten feet. Though straight, its surface has a spirally-twisted appearance, and formerly was sometimes exhibited as the horn of the Unicorn. Upper canines may be present though upper incisors are wanting, as in the case of the Musk Deer and Muntjac. Lower canines may be closely approximated to and shaped Fig. 234.â€”Dentition ok a Sheep.

38o ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [LESS. The true olfactory nerves are filaments which pass from the lobes to the inner surface of the olfactory organ. In man and Mammals they pass through the foramina of the cribri- form plate to the mucous membrane, investing the spongy bones (or lateral ethmoid and turbinate) as described in Lesson VIII. § 13 of the "Elementary Physiology." Pol Pa Fig. 332.—Vertical Longitudinal Sections of the Nasal Cavity. The left-hand figure represents the outer wall of the right nasal cavity ; the right- hand figure the left side of the middle partition or septum of the nose, which forms the right wall of the left nasal cavity. /, the olfactory lobe and its branches ; Vy branches of the fifth nerve ; Pa, the palate which separates the nasal cavity from that of the mouth; ST, the superior turbinal bone; MT, the middle turbinal ; IT, the inferior turbinal. The letter / is placed in the cerebral cavity. The partition on which the olfactory lobe rests, and through which the filaments of the olfactory nerves pass, is the cribriform plate. An essentially similar arrangement to that in man exists in all Vertebrates above Fishes, except in those destitute of an olfactory organ, as the Cetacea. The place of opening of the posterior nares within the mouth varies not only as before noticed in de- scribing the skull, but the aperture mar be placed half-way down the throat, as in Myrmecophaga. The singular elon- gation of the nose in the Elephant has also been adverted to in the Lesson on the Muscles. Singular leaf-like expan- sions of membrane may be developed from the external skin of the nose, as of the Bat Megaderma [n tne Horse-shoe Bats (Rhinolophus yra" and Megaderma, especially the latter genus) and Vampires (Phyllostoma) ; and an extra median ossicle may be developed in the snout, as e.g. in the Mole, Fig. 333.—Membrane de- veloped on the Nose

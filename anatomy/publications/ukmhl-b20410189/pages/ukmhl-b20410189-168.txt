[less. parts of which it is made up in man, the anterior margin of the occipital foramen forming, in the immense majority, part of the posterior boundary of the inferior region. (1) The anterior part ot the basis cranii of man is in him very exceptionally short, both compared with the middle or gut- tural part, and compared with its own width. Its relative length varies of course with the prolonga- tion of the muzzle. Only in Mammals and Croco- diles can it be defined, as in man, by the bony palate—formed as in him by special developments of the palatine and su- perior maxillary bones. Sometimes, as we have seen, this part may be augmented by the ptery- goid bones also taking a share in this structure, as in the Great Ant-eater, the Crocodiles, and Ce- taceans. It is possible, how- ever, as in the Hare, for the bony palate to be very little developed, or, as in the Hedgehog, to be only imperfectly ossi- fied. The form and pro- portion of its component bones afford in Birds im- portant characters for the classification of different groups.

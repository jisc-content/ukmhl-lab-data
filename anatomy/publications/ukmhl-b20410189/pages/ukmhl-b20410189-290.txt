On depressing the lower lip the free outer edges of these plates come into view. Their inner edges are pro- vided with numerous coarse, hair-like processes, consisting Fig. 216.—Mouth of a Whale. of some of the constituent fibres of the horny plates—which, as it were, fray out, and the mouth is thus lined, except below, with a network of countless fibres formed by the inner edges of the two series of plates. This network acts as a sort of sieve. When the whale feeds, it takes into its mouth a great gulp of water, and drives it out again through the intervals of the horny plates ; the fluid thus traverses the sieve of horny fibres, which retain the minute creatures on which these marine monsters subsist.

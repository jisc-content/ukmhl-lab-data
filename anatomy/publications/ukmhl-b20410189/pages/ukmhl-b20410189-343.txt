The fibres of the rectus are interrupted at intervals by transverse tendinous intersections. A small pyramidalis muscle arises on each side of the pelvis, and extends from the pubis to the linea alba. Quadratics lumbormn. This is_a mass of muscle situate close to the vertebral column, and extending upwards from the ilium to the last rib. Layers of fibres between adjacent ribs are called the ex- ternal and internal intercostal muscles. The former extend from the tubercles of the ribs to their cartilages. The latter extend from the sternum to the angles of the ribs. The intercostal nerves and vessels are interposed between them. The levatores costarum are small groups of fibres passing obliquely downwards from the 'transverse processes to the respective ribs at their proximal parts. Triangularis sterni is the name given to a layer of muscle which diverges upwards to the cartilages of the ribs from the deep surface of the lower part of the sternum. 11.

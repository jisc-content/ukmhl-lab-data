vi. ] GENERAL VIE W OF INTERNAL SKELE TON 221 processes of this kind descend from the vertebral centra and constitute a large proportion of the whole axial skeleton.

These elements are developed beneath the skeletal axis (the centra), and therefore in the line of tissue by which are sus- pended the internal plates of the primitive ventral laminae. They have been therefore called hypaxial.1 e Fig. 190.—Diagram of the Further Development of the Trunk as shown in a Section similar to the last. a, alimentary canal supported by a mesentery 2 formed of the dorsal portion of the inner parts of the split wall of the embryonic ventral laminae ; e, epaxial arch ; .^/?, hypaxial arch descending in the" median line in the root of the inner part of the split wall of the ventral laminae; p. rib, bifurcating proximally and abutting ventrally against the sternum, which thus completes the paraxial arch ; m, peritoneum, bounding on all sides the pleuro-peritoneal space. Hypaxial processes may also be developed beneath ver- tebrae to which complete paraxial arches are annexed, as e.g. in the thoracic region of many Birds. 11. Are there yet other elements of this hypaxial system present in man's skeleton ? 1 From v7ro, under (the axial skeleton). 2 For the explanation of a "mesentery" see Lesson XI.

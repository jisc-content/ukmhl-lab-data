v.] SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. 191 pubes are at their maximum of relative size in the Tortoise^ where each develops a large process ending freely, like the ilio? pectineal eminences or marsupial bones of Mammals. In Tailed-Batrachians the ilia are represented by rib-like bones which articulate each with one or at most with two Fig. 163.—Right Side of Pelvis of Frog. //, ilium ; is, ischium ; pubis. The three bones meet at the upper margin of the acetabulum. vertebrae. In the Frogs and Toads the ilia are very peculiar, being extremely elongated, and meeting together posteriorly above the acetabula in an iliac symphysis. In spite of the superficial resemblance between the limbs of man and the Frog, the pelvic structures are thus singularly different. Fig. 164.—The two Ossa Innominata of the Angler-fish {Lophius), showing the ascending processes which simulate ilia. The fin-rays are attached to the outer-ventral margin of each os innominatum. It is not probable that any solid representative of the ilium exists in Fishes, but in the Angler (Lophius) the os innomi- natum sends up a process simulating somewhat the ilium, as does the innominate cartilage in the Chimaera. The ilium of an animal may closely resemble its scapula in shape, as in the Tortoise and Chameleon. The so-called pubis of Reptiles may answer to the ilio- pectineal eminences, or possibly to the marsupial bones,1 of Mammals. A small bone attached to the front of the pubis 1 For these bones see below, p. 194.

These openings are the hinder nostrils, or posterior nares. At each side of the skull, behind the orbit, is to be seen an arch of bone—a sort of flying buttress connecting the skull and face together, and termed the zygoma.1 Fig. 84.—Front View of Right Half of Man's Skull. a, the greater wing of the sphenoid, which also appears in the orbit on the outer side of the opening marked (2) ; f, frontal; m, malar ; ma, mastoid process : me, median part of the ethmoid dividing the nasal fossa vertically in the middle line ; n, nasals; o, lesser wing of sphenoid bounding the opening marked (2) on the inner side ; /, parietal; s, squamous part of temporal bone; 1, optic foramen ; 2, sphenoidal fissure ; 3, infra-orbital foramen. When the skull is looked at in front, we see beneath the forehead two conical sockets for the eyes, termed the orbits, and between them the bony prominence of the nose, beneath which is a large aperture medianly divided by a vertical partition and forming the front nostrils, or anterior nares. . Beneath the outer and lower angle of each orbit the bony projection of the cheek is noticeable, termed the malar2 pro- minence ; and the skull is bounded below (the mandible being removed) by the free border which gives attachment to the teeth, and is termed alveolar, because the teeth are lodged in 1 From £Y'7Gu/ia, a bar. * From mala, the cheek-bone.

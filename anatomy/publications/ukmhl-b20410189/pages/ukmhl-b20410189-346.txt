ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. 302 Muscles named obturator interims and obturator externus spring respectively from the inner and outer surfaces of the obturator membrane and ischium, and are inserted into the trochanteric fossa. Two little muscles (gemelti) arising re- spectively from the spine and tuberosity of the ischium, join the tendon of the internal obturatpr above and below. The quadratus femoris passes from the tuberosity of the ischium to the great trochanter and to the surface of the femur immediately below it. Fig 278.â€”Anterior Muscles of the Right Thigh t, psoas magnus; 2, iliacus ; 3, tensor vaginae femoris; 4, gluteus medius : 5, sartorius ; 6, rectus femoris; 7/vastus externus; 8, vastus internus; 9, points to the junction of the extensor muscles near their insertion into the patella ; 10, aponeurosis of the knee ; 11, pectineus; 12, adductor ; 13, gracilis. A muscle called the tensor vagina? fe?no7'is passes obliquely from the anterior, superior spinous process of the ilium to the membrane which binds down the muscles of the thigh on the outside.

III.] THE CRANIAL SKELETON. 119 part of the perpendicular plate, are parts which have no bony representatives in non-mammalian Vertebrates, with the ex- ception of the Crocodiles. Only that part of each palate bone which connects the body of the sphenoid with the vomer and upper-maxillary bone {i.e. the sphenoidal and orbital processes) is represented by the palatine bones of such non-mammalian Vertebrates.

In almost all those Fishes which have no osseous skull the palate bones are represented by the anterior part of that cartilaginous bridge, or flying buttress, which proceeds from within the front of the mouth backwards and outwards to- wards the point of suspension of the lower jaw, and which in Sharks supports teeth and is called the upper jaw. I Sometimes the horizontal plate has large defects of ossifica- tion, as in many Marsupials and the Hedgehog. Often in Mammals the palatine may directly join the frontal in the orbit, as in the Hog, Lemur, and Pteropus. It may join the lachrymal, as in the Dog. It may extend in the orbit between the lesser wing of the sphenoid and maxillary, and

GENERAL VIEW. 21 V. Pharyngobranchii.—Containing only that headless, heartless fish without red blood—the Amphioxus or Lancelet. The foregoing list has been given to render comprehensible the references to different animals which must be so often given in the succeeding lessons. In those lessons the several parts and organs of man's body will be examined and described, not only directly, but also in the reflected light to be derived from a knowledge of the more remarkable conditions of the same parts in other animals. 24. The organs of man's body may be divided into three classes:— I. Organs of Investment and Support (skeletal). II. Organs of Motion and Innervation, i.e. Muscular and Nervous Structures, and organs of special sense. III. Organs of Sustentation, i.e. nutritive, circulating, re- spiratory, and excretory structures. This division, however, is rather physiological than ana- tomical, so that a more convenient classification (the one to be adopted in the succeeding chapters) will be— I. The Skeleton, both internal {eudoskeleton) and externa! (exo skeleton). II. The Muscular Structures. III. The Brain and Nervous System. IV. The Organs of Sense. V. The Heart, Arteries, and Veins. VI. The Alimentary Tube and its appendages. VII. The Respiratory and Vocal Structures and the Excre- tory Organs. Fig. 35.—The Lamprey ( Petro7nyzon). Fig. 36.—The Lancelet {A mfihiojcus).

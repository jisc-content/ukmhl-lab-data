ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. The olecranon process of man is larger than in many forms ; thus e.g. it is relatively larger than in Birds. It is, however, much larger relatively than in man in many Mam- mals, even e.g. in Baboons, and still more in Ungulates, the Monotremes, and the Mole. There may be a detached sesa- moid ossicle at the end of the olecranon, reminding the observer of the knee-pan, or patella, of the leg. This is the case in some Bats. The ulna's articular surface for the humeru3 may merely complete that offered by the radius, the two together forming a single concavity for the reception of the humerus. This is the case, e.g., in Ruminants. The styloid process may be much more prolonged than in man : we find it so in the Gibbons. The distal part of the ulna may, on the contrary, abort altogether, as in the Bats. It generally, however, articulates with the carpus directly, as the radius does. 16. Inasmuch as the hand of man is made up of the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges, it agrees with the corre- sponding segment in all Vertebrates above Fishes ; where, if any element of the arm is present, the hand is present likewise. 17. Inasmuch as the CARPUS of man consists of a few relatively small bones, it agrees with that of all other Verte- Fig. 143.—Dorsal Surface of Skeleton of Right Hand of the Tortoise Chelydra.

The number of carpal bones, however, may be increased to ten, as in Chelonians, or it may be reduced to two, as in Birds.

ELEMENT A R Y ANA TOMY. [less. 332 muscle, a peculiar flexor brevis i7tci7ius which takes origin | from the palmar fascia. The flexor profiuidus digitorum in man possesses an ex- ceptional distinctness and subdivision. As has been said, it may be intimately united with the subli?nis, as it may also be | (even in Monkeys) with the flexor longus pollicis. When dis-' tinct from the latter, it may yet send a tendon to the thumb, j as in Nycticebus. It may end in but one, or at most two ten- i dons, as in Birds. In the complete separation of this muscle from the one next mentioned, man differs from all the Apes. Flexor longus pollicis. This muscle is very commonly completely united with that last described, as e.g. in Echidna, F.Lp Fig. 300.â€”Di/gram of Flexor Tendons of Hand of Nycticebus. The numbers indicate the digits (from the pollex to the minimus) to which the tendons go respectively. F/p, flexor longus pollicis ; Fp, flexor profundus digitorum ; Fs, flexor sublimis digitorum. Dasypus, and even in the Apes. The two united deep flexor I muscles (profundus and longus pollicis) may fail to send any tendon at all to the two or three ulnar digits, as is the ease l in Bats. When the two deep flexor muscles are distinct, the longus pollicis may send tendons to all the digits, uniting variously with those of the flexor profundus, as in Nycticebus, Loris, and Chamclco. It may send no tendon to the pollex in a form closely allied to man, i.e. in the Orang. Lumbricalcs. These may be altogether absent (as in Birds,

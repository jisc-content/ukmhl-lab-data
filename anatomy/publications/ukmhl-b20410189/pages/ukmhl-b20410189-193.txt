An acromion process is the ordinary Mammalian termi- nation to the scapular spine, but this may be utterly wanting, as in the Hyrax and the Giraffe. It may not only be large, but give off a distinct post-axially directed process, termed the metacromiou, as in the Hare, Elephant, and Shrew, the acromion in the latter animal appearing to bifurcate.

The acromion may join the coracoid process, and thus form a bony loop, as in the Two-toed Sloth and in Birds—the bony connexion answering to the ligament which connects the processes in man. A distinct acromion process may be developed where there is no clavicle, as is the case in the Dolphin. It may be very long and present an articular surface for the humerus, • as is sometimes the case in the Armadillos. The articulation which takes place between the acromion

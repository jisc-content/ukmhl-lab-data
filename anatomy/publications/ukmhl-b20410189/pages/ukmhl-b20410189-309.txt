vii.] THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. 265 equal in vertical extent the four normal cusps, as in the Shrew-mice (Sorex). A prominence may also be developed from the internal part of the band. When this, together with all the other pro- minences, is sharp-pointed (as in the Flying Lemur and the Mole Urotrichns), it produces a maximum of complexity of this special kind.

Ridges may be developed to connect the two external normal cusps with the adjacent cusps of the band, thus form- ing two triangular prisms placed side by side, and each with a flat side turned outwards and an angle inwards ; while some- times but a single prominence may represent the coalesced external normal pair of cusps, all of the cusps being drawn out into sharp points suitable for cracking the hard coats of insects, and constituting the typical insectivorous type of molar as seen in the Mole and Bat, and also in the In- sectivorous Marsupials, Perameles.

The trapezius is a very constant muscle, but may be mud more restricted or more extended in its origin than is the case in man. It may also be divided into two portions, a< notablv in the Mole, where the two origins are very widd apart : (i) the occiput, and (2) the first two lumbar ver-l tebrae. It may be very small, as in Menobranchus (Fig. 286) or may unite with the latissimus dorsi, as in Anguis fragilis, or with part of the deltoid, so as to go directly to the humerus ] as in some Mammals without clavicles. In Bats a long slender segment of this muscle may pasj» along the upper margin of the wing membrane from the occiput to the distal phalanx of the pollex. In the Flying Squirrel Pteromys a similar muscular banc goes to the rudimentary pollex, but it springs from the zy| goma, and is therefore rather a modification of the platysm? myoides than of the trapezius ; as it is also in Galeopithecus ig. 23>—Muscles of the Ventral Aspect of the Breast and Lff Wing of an Eagle [Aqjiilajucosa). {After A.

In Birds an analogous and similarly slender muscle goes; to the pollex or to a sesamoid at its base, but this muscle* is often an offshoot from the pectoralis major, though it may] contain fibres from the deltoid or from the biceps—showing, in what diverse ways a similar want may be supplied.^ The li'^amentum nucha of man is but a rudiment of that vast band, or sheet, of fibres which in many animals (e.jr. the

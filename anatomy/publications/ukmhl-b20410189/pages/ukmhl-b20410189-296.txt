An acquaintance with human structure only, would give the student very little idea of the possibilities of development in the matter of " teeth." As to situation, implantation, number, form, and use, and also as to succession and structure, the greatest diversities are to be found. 21. Man agrees with the whole of his class in that he is only furnished with teeth upon the margins of the jaws. Some members of his class, however, are as completely toothless as are Birds—e.g. the Echid- na, Pangolins, and Ant-eaters. In Reptiles we first become ac- quainted with the fact that true teeth may be developed not only from the margins of the jaws, but also from the palate, as we find to be the case in the Iguana and in Serpents, some of the teeth of which latter, as will shortly be explained, present very remarkable peculiarities. When we descend to the Batrachians we some- Fig. 22T.—Open Mouth of the American Eft Plethodon, Showing the numerous para-sphenoidal teeth at the extreme back of the roof of the mouth, together with a row of palatine teeth placed behind each posterior nasal opening in the anterior part of the palate. times find teeth in two series not only in the upper jaw, but also two series in the lower (as in Proteus and Meno-

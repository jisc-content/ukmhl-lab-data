[less. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. It may develop, as in Fishes, a post-orbital process of its own. Its junction with the malar is not found anywhere out 01 man's class. The squamosal of some Birds (as the Ostrich) may send down a process, the representative of which is more con- spicuous in the Frog, and becomes separated off from the superior portion in the Eft. It is this lower portion which is the pre-operculum of Fishes.

The petrous and mastoid elements (petro-mastoid) of the temporal bone require a more lengthened notice. In the first place, it may be observed that the distinct- ness of these united elements is shown in many Mammals where the petro-mastoid bone remains unanchylosed and separate from both the squamosal and tympanic elements of the temporal bone. This is the case, e.g., in the Pig. It may be united with the tympanic element, but not with the squamosal, as in the Hare and the fully adult Porpoise, being in the latter only united to the rest of the skull by ligamentous attachment. Still, in all man's class, what we have seen to be the con- stituent parts of the petrous and mastoid elements always cohere into a single mass before they unite with other cranial I elements, while such a complete primitive union never takes place in any Vertebrate not a Mammal. The very prominent mastoid process of man is peculiar to him, as, though in many other Mammals it is more or less developed, it is generally rivalled or surpassed in them by ! the elongated process of the occipital bone before mentioned. Even in the highest Apes the degradation of the mastoid

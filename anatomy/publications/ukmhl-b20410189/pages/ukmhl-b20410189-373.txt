THE MUSCLES. VIII. ] 329 Pronator teres. This is a nearly constant muscle, being present even in Menopoma and Menobranchus (Fig. 297). Its size and importance are often relatively greater than in man. It may, on the contrary, be quite absent, as in the Hedgehog and the Horse. Fig. 296.—Muscles of Inside of Right Arm of Iguana. B, biceps; C, sternal margin of coracoid bone; CB1 and CB2, two parts of coraco-brachialis; CC, costo-coracoid ; FR, flexor carpi radialis ; FU, flexor carpi ulnaris ; LD, latissimus dorsi; S 2, subscapulars ; Tl, Z2, and Z"4, parts of triceps ; t, tendon from latissimus dorsi to triceps. Flexor carpi radialis. This is normal in man, but its insertion may vary in other animals. It may arise from the ulna only (and not from the humerus), as in Birds. Fig. 297.—Deeper Flexor Muscles of Right Fore-arm of Menopoma, the flexor longus being cut and reflected. B, biceps; FB, flexor brevis; FL, flexor longus; SL, supinator longus; PT, pronator teres. The palmaris longtts is often absent (as e.g. in the Hedge- hog, in Ruminants, the Horse, &c), or blends with the flexor digitorum, as in the Echidna, or with the flexor radialis. Its

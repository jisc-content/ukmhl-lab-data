236 [less. ELEMENT A R Y AX A TO MY. LESSON VII. THE EXTERNAL SKELETON, THE SKIN AND ITS APPENDAGES. 1. The second category of skeletal parts remains to be considered, namely, those which together constitute the EXTERNAL SKELETON. As has been said when the description of the skeleton wa s begun, fibrous tissue pervades the whole of the human frame, bounding and supporting all its organs. With certain exceptions shortly to be noticed, it is the skin (taking this word in its wide sense) alone of all the fibrous structures which, in other animals than man, develops tissue of a dense and solid natureâ€”horny or bony. 2. Under the head of " external skeleton/' or exo-skeleton^ will be considered the skin and its appendages, that is to say, the skin, whether external or internal, together with structures developed from or in it. Such structures in man are the hair, nails, and teeth, but we shall find that many and diverse exo-skeletal parts may exist which have no direct counterparts in the human frame. 3. The SKIN of man invests his body pretty closely. Nevertheless the roots of the fingers and toes (especially of the three middle toes) are held together by folds of skin, and in some cases these folds extend far along, binding the digits together, and causing the person so affected to be what is called " web-fingered " or " web-toed." k Such a con- dition is constant with regard to two of the toes in an animal so nearly resembling man in structure as the Siamang Gibbon, and is familiar to us in Ducks and Geese. Extensions of the skin far greater than this may, how- ever, take place. Thus, in the so-called " Flying Squirrels | the skin of the sides, between the arms and the legs, is much expanded, serving for a parachute. A skin parachute,

[less. distinct bones, the posterior of which is termed in zootomy the basi-sphenoid, while the anterior ossification (in front of the pituitary fossa) bears the name of pre-sphenoid. The basi-sphenoid is a point of very great morphological importance, marking as it does the anterior termination of the chorda dorsalis, which never advances further forwards than the hinder margin of the sella turcica. Now, there may be no bony representative of the basi- sphenoid at all—although more or less of the rest of the skull be ossified—as is the case in Lepidosiren and the Amphibia ; or it may be represented by a mere rudiment—a little Y-shaped bone, only forming part of the front of the pituitary fossa, as in the Pike. Thus it need form no part of the inside floor of the skull, nor yet any of the basis cranii, although the last-named part be well ossified, as it is in osseous Fishes and Batrachians. In the Ichthyopsida, in fact, only the median bony investment Fig. 104.—Under Surface of the Skull of a Frog. {After Parker.) <r% girdle-bone ; eo, exoccipital ; nix, maxilla ; par, paroccipital ; pm, pre-maxilla , po, pro-otic ; pt, pterygoid ; q, quadrato-jugal ; sus, suspensorium of lower jaw, the lower end of which represents the quadrate bone ; v, vomer; 1, optic foramen ; 2, foramen ova e ; 3, condyloid foramen, of the basis cranii is a special membranous ossification, termed the para-sphenoid, which extends, both backwards and for- wards, far beyond the limits of the basi-sphenoidal region. This "membrane" bone is also large and conspicuous in Snakes (which have the body of the sphenoid in a cartilagi- nous condition), but it seems to be representated in man, if at all, only by the " lingular sphenoidales."

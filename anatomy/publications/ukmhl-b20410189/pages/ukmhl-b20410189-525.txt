477 XIL] THE EXCRETORY ORGAXS. The branchial arches of osseous Fishes are made up of parts to which special names have been applied. They are attached to a median ventral series of pieces termed bast- branchials. The lower piece of each lateral arch is called Left Side : e .-. . : :•: series of closely-set gfll led. On the inner < con- articles of food, or other mber. a hypo-branchial; to this succeeds a ce?'ato-b?'ancJrial. then an epi-bj'anchial, and finally, at the summit, a pha?yngo- branchial. These solid, supporting parts are not constantly or equally developed in all the branchial arches, as is shown by the annexed woodcut of these arches as they exist in the Perch (Fig. 403). The partitions between the gills may extend from thiv solid internal support, outwards to the skin—as in the Sharks and Rays. In such case each gill-chamber opens separately on the side of the body. The partitions may. however, extend but a very little way from such solid internal support, outwards to the skin, while the vascular gill-membrane remains elongated, and conse- quently hangs freely from the outer side of each branchial arch. This latter condition is that which obtains in ordinary- osseous Fishes, e.g. Perch. Carp, Cod. &c Here we find but one large common chamber in which the filamentary gills float, but this chamber is protected by the extension back- wards of a fold of skin (the ope?'culum] supported internally by the opercular bones ; and thus there comes to be in ordinary Fishes but a single large gill-opening on each side behind the head.

ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. 3 Named from the Greek Jo-xt'a, hips. The innominate bone thus consists of three parts, (i) A widely expanded upper part joins the sacrum and extends down to the socket for the thigh. This is the ilium.1 (2) From the thigh-socket a bar of bone runs forwards and inwards. This is the pubis.2 (3) Another, stouter, piece of bone curves first downwards from the thigh-socket, and then inwards and then upwards till it meets the pubis. This is the ischium.3 Fig. 152.—Outer Side of Right Os Innominatum of Man. a, acetabulum; at, anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium ; as, anterior, superior spinous process of the ilium ; c, crest of the ilium ; ip, ilio-pectineal eminence ; o, obturator foramen ; p, pubis —its horizontal ramus ; pi, posterior inferior spinous process ; ps, posterior superior spinous process ; s, spine of the ischium ; t, tuberosity of the ischium. The ilium has a wide outer surface (marked by two curved lines), the upper border of which is termed the " crest" and is convex and arched. From the front end of the crest the anterior border descends sharply to the pubis, a blunt promi- nence (called the zlio-pectineal eminence) marking the point of junction. A sharp prominence (termed the anterior supe- rior spinous process) projects from the anterior border of the ilium at its summit, and another—the anterior inferior spinous process—projects from it a little above the thigh-socket. From the hinder end of the crest of the ilium descends its posterior border, the summit of which is marked by the posterior superior spinous process, separated by a small notch from a 1 So called from its relation to the ilia, entrails. 2 In reference to its superficial exoskeleton—i.e. the hair.

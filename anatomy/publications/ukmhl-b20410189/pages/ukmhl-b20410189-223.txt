v.] SKELETON OF LOWER LLMB. 1tr 3. The femur is the longest bone of man's skeleton, and, like the humerus, is more or less cylindrical, with a rounded head to fit into the acetabulum above, and with an expansion below with two articular surfaces. The shaft is slightly arched for- wards, is smooth in front but with an elongated prominence behind, termed the lt7iea aspera, which is most marked about half-way up the bone. At the upper end of the shaft are two conspicuous projections. The ex- ternal one of these (projecting from the outer margin of the bone, which it continues upwards), is called the great, or peroneal1 trochanter. The internal projection, which is smaller, more conical, and rounded, stands out from the inner and hinder "side of the bone, and is called the lesser, or tibial trochanter. Between the two trochanters, on the hinder side of the femur, a bony prominence extends, which is termed the posterior inter-trochanteric ridge; and a less marked line, the anterior inter-trochanteric ridge, also connects the two trochanters on the front sur- face of the femur. On the inner and hinder side of the great trochanter is a pit, termed the trochanteric fossa. From the inter-trochanteuc ridges a narrower rounded portion of bone projects inwards, forming an obtuse angle with the shaft. This is called the neck of the femur. It ends in a rounded head (forming a large part of a sphere) which fits into the ace- tabulum. The femur is connected with the os innominatum by the strong ligamentum teres before mentioned, the attachment of ' ^ 1 Because situate on the same side as the peroneal bone of the leg.

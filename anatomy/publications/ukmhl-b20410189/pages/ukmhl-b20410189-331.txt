THE MUSCLES. VIII.] 287 of the opposite side (in front in the middle line) and the two together form the muscular floor of the mouth. The genio-hyoid is narrow, and goes from the hyoid to the mandible inside the symphysis. The hyog/ossus'is a flat muscle, passing from the cornua of the hyoid upwards to the side of the tongue. The genio-hyoglossus is a flat, triangular fasciculus, arising inside the symphysis of the mandible, and inserted in a radiating manner from beneath the front of the tongue back- wards to the body of the hyoid. Fig. 265.—Muscles of the Front and Right Side of the Neck. r, anterior belly of digastric ; 2, its posterior belly ; 3, mylo-hyoid ; 4, stylo-hyoid ; 5, stylo-glossus; 6, stylo-pharyngeus ; 7, sterno-hyoid ; 8, omo-hyoid; 9, thyro-hyoid ; 10, sterno-thyroid ; 11, anterior scalenus ; 12, middle scalenus— the posterior scalenus is seen immediately behind it arising from the second rib ; 13, levator anguli scapulae. The sterno-hyoid muscle is a long band which springs from within the sternum or clavicle, and goes to the basi-hyoid. The sterno-thyroid (broader and shorter than the pre- ceding) springs from within the sternum and goes to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx. -The thyro-hyoid appears like a continuation of the last- noticed muscle, and goes from the thyroid cartilage to the great cornua.

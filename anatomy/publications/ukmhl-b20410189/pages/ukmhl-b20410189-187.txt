IV.] 149 SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. of the humerus, while by a similar joint its margin plays into a concavity on the adjacent surface of the ulna. At its lower end the radius becomes much broadened out, and its posterior surface is grooved for the passage of tendons. Its outer side is prolonged into what is called the styloid process. The lower end of the bone articulates with the wrist by a concave surface mainly supporting the hand, which is carried round with the radius in pronation and supination. These motions have been explained in the Seventh Lesson of " Physiology," and are pro- duced by a rotation of the radius on the capitellum. When the arm and hand hang down, the palm being directed forwards, the position is that of supination, and the bones of the fore-arm are situate side by side. When the arm and hand hang downwards, but the back of the hand is turned forwards, the po- sition is that of pronation, and the radius crosses over the ulna. When we rest on the hands and knees, with the palms to the ground, the fore-arms are in pronation. 6. The ULNA is larger than the radius, and while the latter is broader below than above, the reverse condition obtains in the ulna. The shaft is flattened in front, with a sharp outer (or radial) margin, to which an inter- osseous membrane is attached which connects the ulna with the shaft of the radius. Its upper end presents a deep concavity for articulation (by a hinge joint) with the trochlea of the humerus. This fossa is called, from its shape, the great sigmoid cavity? and is divided unequally by a vertical ridge which extends between the two processes which bound the fossa above and below respectively. 1 From 2 and eJ<Jo£.

The digastric of man is closely resembled only by the same muscle in his own order. In other Mammals, e.g. the Dog, it has but a single belly ; and in lower Vertebrates the muscle which commonly receives this name has a very different position. Thus in Birds and Reptiles it descends from the Fig. 284. No. 1.—Muscles of Neck and Shoulder of Iguana, the trapezius and deltoid being cut short. B, biceps; BA, brachialis anticus ; CM, cerato-mandibular; CM a, complexus major; CMiy complexus minor; D1 and D2, two parts of deltoid ; DM, digastric ; EH, epicoraco-humeral, or sub-clavius ; IS, infra-spinatus; LC, levator claviculae; OH, omo-hyoid; P, pectoralis; SCM, sterno-cleido- mastoid ; SMg, serratus magnus; T£, external long head of triceps; T3, external humeral head of triceps ; Tz, trapezius ; x, part of complexus. No. 2.—Deeper Muscles. CA, cervicalis ascendens ; CMa, complexus major; CMi, complexus minor ; DM, depressor mandibular ; RAM, rectus capitis anticus major ; RPM, rectus capitis posticus major; Sc, scalenus ; SCM, sterno-cleido-mastoid ; x, part of complexus. hinder part of the cranium to the posterior end of the man- dible, and in some Birds is divided into three portions. The stylo-hyoid of man is a muscle constant in his class, but of variable size. It may be of extraordinary length, as in the Great Ant-eater, and it may be, as in the Horse, re- latively shorter than in man, the bony extent of the ant-nor

in..] THE CRANIAL SKELETON. 105 process is remarkable, and bears relation to the absence of an erect posture of the body—a posture which distinguishes man from the other members of his order. Air-cells which exist, even in man, in the mastoid, extend into the substance of the squamous element in the Gorilla, and sometimes, as in Macroscelides and Pedetes, the mastoidal air cavities are enormous, causing great projections of the skull. . A large vaginal process is peculiar to man, that part being represented but slightly even in the Gorilla. The carotid canal is far from being a constant character of the temporal bone, even in Mammals. Often, as e.g. in the Cat, the carotid artery may pass through the foramen lacerum posterius, merely grooving very slightly the petrous bone; or much more rarely, as in the Opossum, it may perforate the sphenoid bone. In most Mammals, except the highest Apes, there is a deep pit on the inner surface of the petrous bone, as in the Hare: this is to receive a certain part of the brain, termed the floc- cular process of the cerebellum. The stylo-mastoid foramen is a constant aperture, the seventh nerve passing out through such an opening in the petrous element wherever this is ossified in vertebrate animals.

But not only the seventh nerve, but the third portion of the fifth also, may perforate the same bone, as is the case in Serpents, in Batrachians, and in many Fishes (e.g. the Pike); or it may only notch it, as in Crocodiles and Birds ; or it may, as in man, pass altogether in front of it.

VIII.] THE MUSCLES. 335 muscle's special destination to the fifth digit is a human but not a Mammalian character. Very often, even in man's own order, this muscle may send tendons to the third and fourth digits also The extensor carpi ulnaris, normal in man, may be much increased in size, as e.g. in the Two-toed Ant-eater. It may be diminished—not arising from the humerus—as in some Birds. It may, as in Iguana, be united in one witn the flexor carpi ulnaris.

By biceps ; E 4—E9, extensores metacarporum ; ERB, extensor radialis brevior ; ERL, extensor radialis longior ; EU, extensor ulnaris; EU, flexor ulnaris ; MP, extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis : PQ, pronator quadratus ; SL, supi- nator longus; T, triceps. Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis. This muscle of man ex- emplifies a very constant condition, since it exists in animals in which the pollex is entirely absent, as e.g. in the Horse.

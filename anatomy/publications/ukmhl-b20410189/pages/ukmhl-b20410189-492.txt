The rest of the stomach is divided into a small chamber, the psalteriiim, and a larger terminal portion, the abomasum. Two folds of membrane lead from the lower end of the oesophagus to the psalterium, and convey into it the food which descends after that second mastication (called rnwiinatiori) by which the hastily swallowed grass, regurgitated from the paunch, under- goes the requisite degree of comminution. Another complication of stomach is produced by an enor- mous increase of the muscular coat of the pylorus. A stomach so thickened is called a gizzard, and is found in Fig. 376.â€”Longitudinal Section of the Stomach of the Great Ant-eater (Myrmecophagajubata). ce, oesophagus ; cardiac div.ision of the stomach ; m, thickened muscular walls (or " gizzard ") of pyloric portion of stomach ; Py, orifice of pyloric division ot stomach. {After Owen.) most Birds, especially in those that feed on grain, as the common Fowl. A gizzard may. however, be developed in man's own class, as e.g. in the Great Ant-eater. Yet another form of complication is exemplified amongst Mammals by the Dugong, which animal has two long caecal appendages attached to its stomach. Many caecal appen- dages may coexist, as in Fishes, but these open into thp

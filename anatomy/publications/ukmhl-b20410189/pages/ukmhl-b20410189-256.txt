[less. ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. 214 LESSON VI. THE INTERNAL SKELETON GENERALLY CONSIDERED. i. Having now reviewed the parts composing the internal (bony and cartilaginous) skeleton of man, and seen the mQre remarkable differences which corresponding parts may pre- sent (whether by excess or defect) in other animals, we are in a position to survey the more general relations of the ossified or chondrified skeleton in general, and that of man in particular, and to summarize as follows :â€” The human endo-skeleton, with respect to the number and development of its elements, is a very complete one, except as regards the coccygeal and hyoidean parts of it. The former of these aborts in him as in few other Vertebrates ; the latter is less exceptionally defective. In contrast to this completeness in man, whole skeletal regions may be quite or all but absent in some other forms, as in Whales and Porpoises, Eels and Serpents. In Serpents, indeed, not only are limbs generally quite wanting, but the hyoidean region aborts much more than it does in man. Man's endo-skeleton is highly organized with regard to the mutual relation and adaptation of its parts, though, except as to the opposability of the thumb to the fingers, it is not more perfect in this respect than is that of many beasts. With regard to the number of separate bones of which it is composed, when adult, man's skeleton occupies an inter- mediate position ; as, though in many Vertebrates (especially Fishes), the actual number is greater, yet some Vertebrates (as Frogs, Tortoises, and most Birds) have a smaller number. Thus, while more of the bones of the skull, as also of the sacral region, become fused together in him than in most forms, yet a smaller number of such bones escape anchylosis in the class of Birds than in man. As to the extent of persistent cartilage in the adult condi-

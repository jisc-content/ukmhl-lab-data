ELEMENTARY ANATOMY, 4iS [less. second meets its fellow of the opposite side above to form the dorsal aorta, while the third sends one branch forwards to the skin and another backwards to the lung. Here the aortic arches are not broken up by any interposed minute ramifications. Again, as in Cryptobranchus, we may have two arches on each side, all meeting to form the dorsal aorta, and each hinder one giving off a branch to the lung. This condition Fig. 362.—Maim Arterial Vessels of Cryptobranchus. (After Hyrtl.) a, atlas vertebra ; b, bulbus arteriosus ; c, c, arteries going to the mouth ; d, d, anterior, and e, e, posterior aortic arches meeting at e,the two conjoined arches further uniting at d'; f,f, pulmonary arteries ; gt external maxillary artery; h, internal carotid; z, vertebral; k, left subclavian ; /, right subclavian ; m, spinal artery. reminds us of that early stage in man (before noticed) when the ductus arteriosus connects the pulmonary artery with the aorta ; only in Cryptobranchus; we find such a connexion per- sisting on both sides of the body, while in man the right great aortic arch has aborted. We may also have, as in the Crocodile, two aortic arches —given off respectively from the right and left ventricles— uniting in the dorsal aorta ; or finally, as in man's class and

78 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. at their sutures) it comes away in one piece with a very large and irregularly shaped bone, the " sphenoid," with which it is connected by a solid bony isthmus (forming the middle of the base of the skull), which isthmus has to be sawn across in order to detach the occipital bone for the purpose of anatomical study. Above the occipital foramen the occipital bone forms an expanded plate (the squama)^ marked exteriorly by transversely extended " curved lines." 1)0 Fig. 85.â€”Outer Surface of Man's Occipital Bone. bo, basilar part or body of the bone which unites with the body of the sphenoid ; c, one of the two "condyles ; /, superior curved line ; inferior curved line ; one of the jugular eminences ; so, the squama, or expanded upper part of the occipital; 1, condyloid foramen ; fm, foramen magnum. The " condyles," before noticed, are attached to this bone, and external to each is a slight roughened process called the "jugular" eminence, because it borders that aperture of the skull through which the jugular vein comes out. Behind each condyle is a small hole, or foramen, which allows the hypoglossal1 nerve to pass out from the brain. The occipital unites, as has been said, with the sphenoid in front. Above this junction it articulates on each side with the bone from which springs the mastoid process and zygoma, 1 For this and other nerves see Lesson VIII.

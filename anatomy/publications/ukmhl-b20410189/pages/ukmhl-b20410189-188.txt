[less. ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. The lower process is called the coronoid,1 and is received into the corresponding fossa on the front of the humerus. The higher and much larger process is termed the ole- cranon- and fits into the olecranal cavity on the back of the humerus. The olecranon forms the prominence of the elbow, and terminates in a rough tuberosity. On the outer side of the coronoid process is a small articular surface, called the lesser sigmoid cavity, for the border of the head of the radius, which turns upon it. The lower end of the ulna has two eminences. The ex- ternal or radial one, called the head, is much the larger, and presents two articular surfaces. One of these is nearly circular, and articulates with the wrist; the other, narrow and convex, articulates with a concavity on the adjacent surface of the radius.

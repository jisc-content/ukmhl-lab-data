ELEMENTAR Y A MA TO MY. [less. 6 Each order consists of smaller groups, which groups bear each the title family. Each family is composed of still smaller divisions, termed genera. Each genus is made up of one, few or many speciesj each species being composed of individuals differing only as re- gards sex, and capable of reproducing other individuals similar to themselves. The whole of these groups are defined by peculiarities of form and structure ; that is to say, the classification is based upon the number and shape of parts and organs, and not by what such parts and organs do, i.e. it is morphological and not physiological. 9. One great primary group, i.e. one sub-kingdom (or division)—that to which we belong—includes, besides our- selves, all beasts, birds, reptiles, frogs, toads, and efts (or newts), and all fishes truly so called. The creatures of this sub-kingdom agree in possessing a spine, that is a backbone (or a cartilaginous or gelatinous representative of it). In all the higher of these animals, including man, the backbone is made up of a number of bony pieces termed vertebrae, and on this account the term Vertebrata is given to the whole group, which is spoken of as the Vertebrate sub-kingdom.

Another primary group, sub-kingdom, or division, in- cludes all snails, slugs, cuttle-fishes,1 and creatures of the oyster and scallop class. The name Mollusca2 is applied to this group, and the creatures composing it are often spoken of as the Molluscous animals, or Mollusks. A third great primary group or sub-kingdom is termed Annulosa.3 They are creatures the bodies of which are 1 Improperly called fishes ; as also are the oyster and its allies. 2 Mollusca, from mollusctis, mollis, soft, 3 Annulosa, from aimuhts^ ring.

[less. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY, 316 cornua. Thus we may have—I. Muscles connecting the hyoidean and branchial arches (e.g. the cerato-hyoideus ex- teruus and internus). 2. Muscles connecting the branchial arches of each side (e.g. the constrictores arcuum of Meno- branchus. 3. Muscles suspending the branchial arches to the parts above them—as the levatores arcuum of Menobranchus. The conditions of man's sterno-hyoid are very generally present, but the muscle may be wanting, as in Chelonians, or Fig. 286. — Superficial Muscles of Right Side and of Extensor Surface of Right Pectoral Limb of Menobranchus. AB, adductor branchiarum ; B, biceps ; CP, constrictor pharyrrgis; CHE, cerato- hyoideus externus ; D, deltoid; Di. first part of digastric; EB, extensor brevis; EL, extensor longus ; ExO, external oblique; LA, levatores arcuum; LA1, first part of the same; LD, latissimus dorsi; M, masseter; MH'Z, mylo hyoideus posterior ; OH, omo-hyoid ; S, subclavius ; SL 1 and SLZ, supinator longus; T, temporalis; Tz, tiapezius; T2, triceps; CJ% ulnaris. arise as far back as the xiphoid, as in the Ant-eaters. It may unite with its fellow to form a thick azygos muscle, as in the Dolphin, or arise from the anterior ribs and be inserted into the mandible as well as into the cornua, as in Serpents. It may also form part of a great muscular mass passing un- interruptedly from the pelvis to the hyoid, as in Menobran- chus, and thus we see that it enters into the composition of that part of each great lateral muscle which in Fishes is inserted into the median portion of the hyoidean arch. A separate sterno-thyroid and a distinct thyro-hyoid are structures peculiar to man's class. The former blends with the

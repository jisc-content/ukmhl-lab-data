[LESS. 290 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. The splenius is placed obliquely in the neck, extending from the spines of dorsal and cervical vertebrae to the trans- verse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae and to the mastoid process : the latter insertion defines the splenius capitis; the former the splenius colli.

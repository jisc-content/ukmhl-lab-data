XII.] THE EXCRETORY ORGANS. 479 In the Tenth Lesson has been already described the mode in which the blood is brought to the gills from the heart, and from the gills to the general circulation, as also the changes which, in Batrachians, accompany the disappearance of the gills during the developmental metamorphosis. The blood is carried in osseous Fishes (e.g. the Perch) along the convexity of each branchial arch both to and from the gill-filaments, the margins of which are skirted by arterial and venous branches, capillary vessels being inter- posed between them.

On its upper side is seen a concavity which is produced l-y the section of the groove which runs along the convex and exterior (here upper) side of each branchial arch, ba, branchial artery in section, giving oft* the gill-arteries (go) to the adjacent sides of the gill-leaflets, whence the blood is distributed in the leaflets ; gv, the gill-veins which run along the outer side of the gill-leaflets, collecting the blond from them by minute veins and pouring it into bv, the branchial vein, which runs down the groove of the branchial arch and has the branchial artery superficial and exterior to it. Gills which are at first conspicuous but mostly disappear ultimately, are termed external b7'anchice. Such are absent in almost all adult Fishes, though often present in the young con- dition, e.g. in young Sharks. In Batrachians, such as the Tad- pole, they also disappear and give place to internal gills ; but in some forms, e.g. Axolotl and Menobranchus, they persist throughout the whole of life as long plume-like appendages placed on each side of the neck.

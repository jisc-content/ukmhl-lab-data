3 GENERAL VIEW. work (the bony skeleton), on which are laid bundles and layers of flesh or muscle, the whole being enclosed by skin. An external opening, the mouth, is the beginning of a long and convoluted alimentary tube, which varies in size in dif- ferent parts before reaching its termination, and has annexed to it a variety of glands, as the liver, pancreas, and salivary glands. This long tube occupies part of a great internal cavity in the trunk of the body, in which cavity are also placed the heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, and bladder, the heart1 being situated on the ventral aspect of the cavity. Fig. i.â€”A Diagrammatic Section ok the Human Body taken verti- cally THROUGH THE MEDIAN PLANE. The ventral cylinder, containing the convoluted alimentary tube, lungs, &c, is bounded by the thick black line. The dorsal cylinder, bounded by oblique lines, is shown expanding above into the brain cavity. 5. Thus man's trunk may be conceived as a sort of fleshy cylinder, but in fact it is made up of two cylinders of very different size and structure. 1 The various organs here enumerated by anticipation are described in sub- sequent Lessons.

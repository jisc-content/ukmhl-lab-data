SKELETON OF LOWER LIMB. v.] 211 The number five is never {From Flower s " Osteology.") In such cases a separation of the lower end of the bone into articular condyles for the different digits indicates the composite nature of the bone. There may be but four metatarsals well developed, as in the Dog ; or but three, as in Rhinoceros ; or two, as in the Hog and Proteus ; or but one, as has been mentioned, in the Horse and Chceroptts. They may be anchylosed to- gether at their proximal ends, as in the Three-toed Sloth. The metatarsals never seem to decrea.se in size from the first to the fifth, but often, as in man, from the second to the fourth. They may increase in size from the first to the fifth, as in the Great Ant-eater and the Orni- thorhynchus. The two central ones may greatly exceed the lateral ones, as in the Hog ; or the first and fifth may greatly exceed in size the three central ones, as in the Seal. The second metatarsal is never exceptionally reduced, while the other four all remain well developed. The metatarsals are never enormously elongated like the inetacarpals of Bats. All may be extremely short and stunted, as in the Land Tor- :oises and Ichthyosaurus, ncreased (except by monstrosity^) in any known Verte- Drates. The vertical line of bilateral symmetry in the foot may 3ass (as in the Ox and Sheep), so as to have the third meta- arsal on one side of it and the fourth metatarsal on the other; br it may (as in the Horse and Rhinoceros) pass through the niddle of the third metatarsal. The latter symmetry may prevail where there are four P 2 Fig. 182.â€”Bones of Right Pes of Jerboa {Difius /Egyptius). a, astragalus ; c, calcaneum ; cl\ cuboides ; r2, meso-cuneiforme ; <r3, ecto-cuneiforme ; //.

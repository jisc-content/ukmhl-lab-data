190 ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY. [less. The ilium may be a three-sided columnar bone, as in the Kangaroo and many Rodents. The posterior part of the ilium may become anchylosed with the ischium, as is the case in Birds. Wherever there is an acetabulum it is in part formed by the ilium.

The ilium may be altogether absent while the ischium is present, as probably in the Cetacea. It is never present without any other pelvic element, except in the Amphisbenian group of Reptiles. The prominence of the inferior anterior spinous process in man is exceptional, yet it is exceeded in proportion in some of the Lemuroidea. In Marsupial Mammals and Monotremes we find two distinct bones articulated, one on each side of the pre-axial margin of the pubes. They are called "Marsupial bones" and* are further noticed below, § 11. The ilio-pectineal eminence is rudimentary in man com- pared with that existing in some other animals even of his own class. Thus in certain Bats it is a very elongated spine projecting upwards from the brim of the pelvis, and it is a very prominent process in the Kangaroo, and sometimes in Marsupials arises from an independent ossific centre. In Reptiles we find a pair of separate bones, usually called the pubes, and meeting generally in a ventral symphysis. They do not, however, so meet in all Reptiles, e.g. the Crocodiles and the Snake Stenostoina. These so-called

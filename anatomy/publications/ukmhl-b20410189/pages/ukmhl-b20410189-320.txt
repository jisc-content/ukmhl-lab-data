A third kind of complex tooth is presented by one Mammal only, though certain Fishes present a more or less similar structure. The animal referred to is the Cape Ant-eater {Orycteropus), which possesses the only really com- pound teeth found amongst Beasts. Each tooth is cylindrical in shape, and apparently simple, but when cut transversely exhibits a number Fig 254.-The Aardvark, of minute apertures, as does a cut or Cape Ant-eater. cane. Each of these apertures is the (prycteropvs). orifice of a pulp-cavity cut across, and from each of these cavities minute dentinal tubuli radiate in every direction, so that the tooth is really made up of a number of very elongated and slender denticles anchylosed together into one solid mass.

They did so, however, in some of those extinct flying Reptiles the Pterosauria, and also the extinct' Reptiles Dicyiiodon had a tooth which grew from a perma- nent pulp on each side of the head, though the jaws seem to have been furnished with a horny beak. 34.

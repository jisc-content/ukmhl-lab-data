On the other hand, they may be excessively reduced—mere delicate laminae of bone, as in Porpoises. The free condition of man's cervical vertebrae is normal and Fig. 61 — Section of most Pre-axial Vertebra, and part of Skull of Siluroid Fish, Bagrus.

The lateral parts of the first two vertebrae (between eo and s) are united by suture with each other and the skull. almost constant in his class. Not quite so, however, for in the true Whales they usually become anchylosed together, so as to form a sort of cervical sacrum. They may, on the contrary, be distinguished as the only free vertebrae except the coccygeal ones, as is the case in Tortoises ; and as in Birds, where the long and very mobile neck has to supply the place of an arm in supporting a beak which rivals in delicacy of action any hand and fingers known to us, as is manifest from the wonderful construction of their many kinds of nest. That part of each cervical vertebra which is called the body varies as to shape in the way just described in speak- ing of the cervical vertebrae considered as whole and entire bones. The pre-axial concavity and post-axial convexity which the bodies exhibit, represent the much more marked concavity and prominence which we find in some Mammals, e.g. the Sheep and Horse. In the lowest Mammals (Echidna and Ornithorhynchus) the cervical transverse processes remain as distinct more or lem

256 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. | the process of development of human teeth are interestingly I illustrated by permanent conditions in other animals. Thus we may have, as in Sharks, an open groove along I each jaw, in which groove dermal papillse appear and undergo F calcification directly without their becoming enclosed in sacs I at all. We may have, as in the Pike, an enclosure of each papilla in a sac, but no development of bone round it, the teeth I being attached to the jaw by ligament. We may have teeth which become anchylosed to the summit of the jaw, there being no bony wall (or alveolus) developed [j on either the inner or the outer side of the teeth, as in certain I Lizards (e.g. Psatnmosaurus\ termed Acrodont.1 Fig. 223.—Side View of the Skull of a Lizard (Varanus), with ACRODONT TEETH. a, articular bone of mandible; c, coronoid bone of mandible ; d, dentary ; /, frontal; f\ pre-frontal ; f"t post-frontal; /, lachrymal; ?/z, malar; mx, maxilla; ny nasal , o, pro-otic; fiy parietal; fit, pterygoid ; fit, columella, or dismemberment of pterygoid ; fit", os transversum ; px, pre-maxilla ; q, quad- rate bone ; sqt squamosal. We may find a development of a bony alveolar plate on one side (the outer), to which the teeth may become attached by actual bony growth (anchylosis), as in the Iguanian Lizards. Such a form of attachment is termed pleurodo7it? "N^e may find two alveolar plates of bone, but no transverse bony partitions, as in Ichthyosaurus, We may find both alveolar plates together with transverse partitions forming distinct alveoli, which nevertheless are incompletely divided one from another at the hinder part of the mouth, as in many of the Dolphin tribe ; and finally, we 1 From aKpog, sharp, and odovg, a tooth, 'J From -rrXevpov, a side, and obo\£.

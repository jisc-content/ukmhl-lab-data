Normally there is never more than one pair amongst existing Ruminants, with the exception of Antelope qnadi'icomis, which has two pairs. Such horns may be straight, or curved, or spirally twisted, but they are never branched, with the single exception of the Prong- horned Antelope. Fig. 213.—The Pangolin (Mams). Less familiar, but not really more remarkable, is the struc- ture developed in the scaly Manis or Pangolin. Here the entire body is covered and protected by strong, sharp-edged, overlapping horny plates, each of which is comparable with a nail. Fig. 214.—Tail of Rattlesnake. The overlapping scales of Serpents are horny investments of processes of the dermis, but the scales of Fishes are of different nature, being formed in the dermis itself.

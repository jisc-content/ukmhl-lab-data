ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. [less. 328 Triceps. The great extensor of the arm in man, in spite of its size and complexity, is small and simple compared with conditions which may obtain. Thus it may (as in Hyrax) have four heads, and in addition a fasciculus going from the surface of the infra-spinatus to the olecranon, and called the dorso-epitrochlear (Fig. 295, De.) It may be very powerful Fig. 295. —Muscles of Outer Side of Fore-limb of Hyrax. serratus magnus ; Rc, rhomboideus capitis; SsJ>, supra-spinatus; Isp, infra-spinatus ; D, deltoid ; Tmaj, teres major : De> dorso-epitrochlear; T1—4, triceps ; Ba, brachialis anticus ; Sf, supinator longus ; Eldy extensor longus digitorum ; Emd, extensor minimi digiti., and take origin largely from the scapula, as in the Pig and Echidna, or it may take origin from the coracoid also, as in the Iguana. It may be quite rudimentary, as in the Porpoise. 21. The MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM in man attain almost their maximum of complexity. As might be expected, they become greatly reduced in animals the hands of which have little mobility (as Birds and Cetaceans) or have a reduced number of digits. In Birds the actions of the pronators and supinators are modified and limited to opening and shutting the wing, i.e. to ad- and ab-duction.

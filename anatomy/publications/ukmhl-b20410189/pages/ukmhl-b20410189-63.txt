29 THE SPINAL SKELETON. n.] one of the other cervicals, when compared with a dorsal vertebra, presents the following characters :— The centrum is smaller, wider in proportion to its depth, somewhat concave from side to side on its upper surface, and from before backwards on its under surface. The neural canal and neural arch are wider, and the neural spine much smaller and shorter (except in the case of the seventh cervical vertebra), and often bifid, so that there are two irregular processes projecting side by side. There is no long transverse process, but a short one juts out from between the zygapophyses (therefore in the situation of the transverse process of a dorsal vertebra), and another projects from the body at the root of the pedicle, just at the place where the capitular articular surface of a dorsal vertebra is placed, and so may be called the capitular process. These two short processes are connected towards their ends by a bridge of bone which extends backwards and somewhat down- wards from the capitular process to the posterior process. A space is thus enclosed on each side by the pedicle, the two processes and the bridge, and it is on this account that the cervical vertebrae are sometimes said to have perforated transverse processes. As these processes are superimposed like the vertebrae that support them, these successive, small, bony rings form a sort of bony canal running upwards on each side of the neck-part of the backbone, and this canal serves to protect the vertebral artery which traverses it. The free end of each transverse process divides into two blunt prominences called " tubercles." c, centrum ; s, neural spine ; d, tubercular process; capitular process ; a, an- terior articular surface for atlas ; z', postzygapophysis; o, odontoid process ; ky, median vertical ridge beneath centrum. 10. The second cervical vertebra is peculiar, differs from every other joint of the backbone, and has a special name, the axis. Fig. 41.—The Axis Vertebra.

ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. 28o Some Deer have enormous antlers, weighing as much as seventy pounds, and are formed at the rate of one pound a day. Great as must be the strain on the system from such a demand, it must yet be exceeded by the effects on Birds of the production of an entire new plumage when moulting. The antlers, like the bony cores of the hollow-horned rumi- nants, are rather outgrowths from the skull than skin struc- tures. Yet in the Giraffe we find short bony horns formed from ossifications independent of the skull, with which they unite at a later period only. Such are the principal structures which may be described under the head of exo-skeleton. Other appendages of the skin which are not skeletal, but excretory (as the milk glands, scent glands), will be noticed in the Twelfth Lesson as coming within the group of "excretory structures."

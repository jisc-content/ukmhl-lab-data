IX.] THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 38i The anterior bony nares may be continued on by a single passage having a single opening on the surface (as in the Porpoise), the channel being also connected with a complex appendage of sacs. Each nostril may still have two apertures, and yet both of these may open on the external surface, as in Fishes. Finally, the nasal organ may be absolutely single and median, as in the Marsipobranchs, ending below in a blind termination, as in the Lamprey, or opening into the pharynx, as in the Myxine. 13. The envelope of the third ventricle of the brain is a most constant and morphologically important structure, small and subordinate as it appears in adult man. We have seen, however, that the fore-brain is relatively large at first, even in him, and it so remains in all the members of the lowest class of Vertebrates. In Fishes indeed this part attains a great relative size, and by some anatomists it is believed to combine with part of Fig. 334.—Brain of t ie Perch {Perca jtuviatihs) seen from above. j, one of the olfactory lobes ; 2, one of the cerebral hemispheres ; 3, the pineal gland ; 4, one of the hollow vesicles commonly called " optic lobes"; 5, the posterior median prominence commonly termed the cerebellum, but by some deemed to be a special development of the "mid-brain."

This segment of the brain is well marked out by the pineal gland above and the pituitary body below.

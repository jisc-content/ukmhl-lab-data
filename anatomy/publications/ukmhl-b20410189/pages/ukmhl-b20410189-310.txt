Such a condition exists in Centetes, Hemicentetes, and especially in Chrysochloris. Fig. 239.—Grinding Surfaces of Upper Molars of Left Side. a, b, and c, remnants of principal cusps. Another kind of modification of the teeth is that by which the typically carnivorous molar is arrived at. This is best exemplified by the last pre-molar, which in the Dogs, Cats, and their allies has been called the " sectorial" or " carnassial I tooth of the upper jaw.

Here (in the Cats) it consists almost entirely of three sharp,! strong,unequal cusps placed one behind the other on the outer' margin of the tooth, and connected together by trenchant ridges, while inside the foremost cusp is a small, short,; and blunt accessory one. From a study of Marsupial teeth ; it appears that the three outer cusps answer to the cusps ol the cingulum blended with the two outer principal cusps oi man, while the rudimentary internal cusp is the representative

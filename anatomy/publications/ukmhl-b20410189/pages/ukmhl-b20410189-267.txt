vi.] GENERAL VIE W OF INTERNAL SKELETON 225 Sometimes, as in the Sharks, not only are there solid splanchnapophyses, but there are at the same time external Fig. 195.—Diagram of the condition of the Skeleton in the Branchial Region of a Lamprey (transverse vertical section). «, neural canal; b, alimentary canal, only bounded by b', which is a membra- nous representative of splanchnapophysial parts ; v, the ascending vessels ; py the paraxial system (external cartilaginous skeleton of the gills), or branchial basket. paraxial cartilages (like those of the Lamprey) coexisting with the splanchnapophysial hard parts of the branchial region.

The general summary of the endo-skeleton here given refers, of course, to the skeleton in its most developed con- dition, and expresses the greatest complexities exhibited to us amongst the whole series of vertebrate animals. But, as the most perfect skeleton is at one time an embryonic structure devoid of both bone and cartilage, so in the lowest of Vertebrates the skeleton is (as we have seen) in a soft, membranous condition. In lieu of the complex dif- ferentiation of higher forms, we find in Amphioxus only sheets of membrane, or lamellae, placed more or less at right angles to the very long axis of the body and proceeding out- wards from the notochord to the skin. The whole series of such membranous body-girdles may Q

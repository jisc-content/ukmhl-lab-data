The tibialis posticus may be entirely absent, even in man's class, as in the Rabbit and Tapir. It may be very strong, and inserted into the astragalus, as in the Echidna, or run on to the ento-cuneiforme, as in Lemur. The muscle may be very greatly developed, as in the Beaver and Wombat. It is constant, as not only in Reptiles (e.g. Lguana and Chafneleo), but even in the Frog it exists (inserted into the astragalus), though it does not seem distinct in Tailed- Batrachians.

The MUSCLES OF the FOOT of man possess of course, like its skeleton, special characters in harmony with the i peculiar function of that organ as the sole support and agent 1 of progression of an erect and relatively large and ponderous I body. These muscles, like those of the hand, can for the J most part be profitably compared only with those of man's

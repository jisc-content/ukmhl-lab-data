vi.] GENERAL VIEW OF INTERNAL SKELETON. 227 14. The cranial characters presented by man may be indicated in the following generalized manner :— The skull may be said to consist of a central axis (formed by the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid), to which ascending and descending arches are annexed, and in which certain structures are intercalated. We have the occipital arch, and in front of this a second arch formed by the great alae of the sphenoid and the parietals, Fig. 197.—Ideal, Generalized Diagram of an Osseous Skull. a, ali-sphenoid ; ar, articulare ; bh, basi-hyal ; bo, basi-occipital; bs, basi-sphe- noid ; cb, cerato-branchial; ch, cerato-hyal ; cpt, ecto-pterygoid ; d, dentary , eb, epi-branchial ; eh, epi-hyal ; eo, ex-occipital ; ep, epiotic; ept, ento-ptery- goid ; f, frontal ;fo, fenestra ovalis ; f2, fenestra rotunda ; g, quadrato-jugal; gh, glosso-hyal ; hb, hypo-branchial; Ic, lachrymal ; le, lateral-ethmoid; m, maxilla ; ma, malar ; me, median-ethmoid ; mpt, meta-pterygoid ; n, nasal : op, opisthotic ; os, orbito-sphenoid ; p, parietal; pa, para-sphenoid; pb, pharyngo- branchial ; pf, post-frontal; pi, palatine ; pm, pre-maxilla ;ps, pre-sphenoid :pt, pterygoid ; ptc, pterotic; px, hyo-mandibular ; q, quadratum ; sh, stylo-hyal; so, supra-occipital; sph, sphenotic; sq1, squamosal ; sq2, pre-operculum; t, ostrans- versum ; th, tympano-hyal; v, vomer ; zT, upper zygoma ; z2, lower zygoma. and, again in front, a third arch formed by the orbital alse and the frontal. Into the median gap bounded by the arch of the frontal, the olfactory organ (the ethmoid) is, as it were, thrust. Into the gap left on each side between the lateral occipital and the great ala of the sphenoid, the auditory organ (the temporal bone) is thrust. Similarly, the much smaller lateral gap left between the great ala and the orbital wing of the sphenoid is related to the organ of sight, which, though not ossified in man, like Q 2

III.] THE CRANIAL SKELETON. have a different function from that they have in man ; or having the same function as in him, they may be considerably increased in size and importance. They may be absent as distinct bones even in man's class —especially in forms which pass a large part or the whole of their lives in water, and where the secretion of tears is super- fluous. Thus they are absent by anchylosis with the malar in the Dolphins, and are wanting altogether, unless early anchylosed with the maxillary or malar, in the Seals and Pangolins. On the contrary, though very small, they are present in the Elephant and Sirenia, but in an imperforate condition. fiG. 108.—Upper View of the Skull of a Dolphin (Delphums globiceps).

In Fishes, of course, there is no achrymal foramen. ! These bones appear to be absent altogether in Batrachians, ind sometimes in Birds, though present, and sometimes large, n Reptiles {e.g. Chelonians). I In that the lachrymal is confined to the orbit, man differs rom most of his own class, except the Apes; even in animals IF o high up in the scale as Lemurs it not only extends on to he cheek, but the lachrymal foramen is placed there.

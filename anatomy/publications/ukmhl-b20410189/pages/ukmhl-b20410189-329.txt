viii.] THE MUSCLES. 285 The orbicularis oris is a muscle surrounding the aperture of the mouth. The masseter passes from the malar down to the angle of the lower jaw. The temporalis occupies the side of the skull within the zygoma, and is inserted into the coronoid process of the mandible. The pterygoidcus inte7'nus passes from the pterygoid fossa to the inner surface of the mandible just above its angle. The pterygoideus externus arises from the ali-sphenoid (including the part called "external pterygoid process "), and is inserted into the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw and into the inter-articular fibro-cartilage. Inside the bony orbit, we have four slender, long, straight muscles (or recti), and two oblique muscles, all inserted into the sclerotic, or outer coat of the globe of the eye.

S.R., the superior rectus ; Inf.R. the inferior rectus ; E.R., the external rectus ; in.R.> the internal rectus; S.Ob., the superior oblique ; Inf.Ob., the inferior oblique: Ch., the chiasma of the optic nerves (II.) \ III., the third nerve, which supplies all the muscles except the superior oblique and the external rectus. The four recti all arise at the bottom of the orbit, about the optic foramen, and are respectively inserted into the eyeball above, within, below, and without, whence they are termed superior, internus, inferior, and externus. The obliquus superior (a slender muscle, like each of the recti) also arises near the optic foramen. At the inner margin

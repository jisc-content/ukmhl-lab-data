III.] \2l THE CRANIAL SKELETON.. as in osseous Fishes, the actual lower jaw, consisting of a dentary and other bones, suspended from the side of the skull by the intervention of more than one bone. In the last-named group the lower jaw is suspended from elements of the ear capsule (viz. the sphenotic, pterotic, and pro-otic) by a bone called the Hyomandibular, and by other bones the lowest of which is termed the Quadrate, with which the uppermost part of the lower jaw articulates. The bones from the hyomandibular to the quadrate (inclusive), or the cartilaginous parts which in* some forms may represent these, are collectively termed the suspensorium.

A lower jaw, however, may be entirely and completely ! absent, as is the case in the Lamprey. In forms in which the skurl is not osseous (as the Sharks) ;the mandible is represented by cartilage. Wherever below Mammals the skull is ossified, the lower jaw consists of a bone representing the lower jaw of man and Mammals, together with three or four other bones forming with jit the actual ramus on each side ; and, in addition, there is a distinct part by which this complex ramus articulates with the suspending bone or bones which sustain it. This articular part, with the suspending bone (called the "quadrate" in Birds and Reptiles) or bones (of which there may be several, as in Fishes), all taken together, answers to parts which are not commonly reckoned as portions of the skeleton in man, namely to parts of the internal ear, i.e. to

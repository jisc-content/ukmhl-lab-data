82 [less. ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY. this is the foramen rotundum, through which passes the second branch of the fifth nerve. Behind this is a larger foramen (termed from its shape foramen ovale), which gives exit to the third branch of the fifth nerve. On each side of the sella turcica, at its hinder part, is a groove for the carotid artery. This groove is bounded in front and externally by a small tapering piece of bone which is called the lingula sphenoidalis, and which is situated between the body of the bone and the greater ala. a, its greater wing—the lower letter a points to that downward continuation of the great wing which is called the external pterygoid process ; 6s, its body- showing a cut surface behind, where it has been separated from the occipital bone; pc, the clinoid plate, bounding the pituitary fossae behind; ps, the anterior, or pre-sphenoidal part of the body of the bone; o, lesser or orbital wing ; p, internal pterygoid process ; i, optic foramen ; 2, sphenoidal hssure ; 3, foramen rotundum ; 4, foramen ovale ; 5, groove for the carotid artery. The greater ala passes up between the squamosal and the frontal to the parietal bone, and forms the anterior part of the temporal fossa and the hinder, outer part of the bony orbit. The downwardly extending plate is called the external pterygoid1 process. The internal pterygoid process is more slender, terminating below in a hooked-like, or hamular, pro- cess. The two internal pterygoid processes form what have been fancifully called the legs of the sphenoid. Between the internal and external pterygoid process of each side is a space called the pterygoid fossa, which is closed behind by a palate bone. From the anterior part of the body the much smaller wings called "orbital" project outwards, one on each side. The Fig. 86.—Man's Sphenoid Bone seen from above.

THE SPINAL SKELETON. 3i .] lentioned as correspondingly situate on the axis vertebra, 'he upper pair of surfaces, which are larger and more up-shaped, articulate with two prominences on the base of he skull. I The atlas vertebra is formed to turn on the odontoid pro- ess of the axis as on a pivot. This is further explained in tie Seventh Lesson of " Elementary Physiology." 12. Having noted the characters of vertebras above the epical dorsal ones, those below {i.e. the lower dorsal and imbar) come next. The lower dorsal vertebras have their centra larger than jhose of the upper, while their transverse processes become horter, and their articular processes change their direction, jhe upper zygapophyses looking obliquely inwards, the lower nes obliquely outwards. Finally, their neural spines project 2ss downwards. E In the last dorsal vertebra a small rounded prominence Irises from the posterior margin of each upper articular [kocess. This prominence is termed the mammillary process, !>r Metapophysis.1 j Another small prominence projects backwards from between the upper articular process and the transverse pro- ess, and is called an Anapophysis.2 I Fig. 43.â€”A Lumbar Vertebra. , centrum ; s, neural spine; t, tubercular process; z, prezygapophysis; J . 2', postzygapophysis ; m, metapophysis ; a, anapophysis. I The lumbar vertebrae have their centra still more mas- sive than the dorsal centra, and deeper in front than behind. ; The neural spines are all more massive, and project directly backwards instead of downwards. The transverse processes are larger, and there are no tuber- cular or capitular surfaces, and no process in the place of he latter, as are found in the cervical vertebras. 1 From jjierdy after, and apophysis. 2 From dvct, backwards.

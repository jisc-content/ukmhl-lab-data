[less. ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY, 284 auriculam, the retrahejites auriculam, and the zygomato- aiwicularis, arise from above, behind, and in front of the ear, to the external part of which they are attached. In rare cases a man is able to move his ear by the contraction of these muscles. The orbicularis palpebrarum is a muscle which surrounds the eye beneath the skin, and is not attached to any bone except at the inner margin of the orbit. By its contraction it closes the eyelids. A little muscle, the levator palpebrce, takes origin deep in the orbit (above the optic foramen), and is inserted into the upper eyelid, which it raises. No analogous muscle depresses the lower eyelid. Other muscles of man which are connected with the lips or nose are :—1. Pyramidalis nasi. 2. Levator labii supe- rior is alceque nasi. 3. Co7npressor naris. 4. Depressor alee nasi. 5. Levator proprius alee nasi. 6. Levator labii superioris (which takes origin from the maxilla and malar). 7. Levator anguli oris (arising below the infra-orbital fora- men). 8. Zygomaticus minor (going from the malar to join No. 6). 9. Zygomaticus major (going from the malar to the angle of the mouth). 10. Depressor anguli oris (springing from the mandible). 11. Depressor labii inferioris (placed near the front of the lower jaw. Fig. 262.—Deeper Muscles of the Right Siee of the Head. 1, temporal; 2, corrugator supercilii; 3, transversalis nasi ; 4, depressor alaj nasi; 5, levator anguli oris; 6, buccinator, traversed towards its hinder part by the duct of the parotid gland ; 7. depressor labii inferioris; 8, levator menti; 9, masseter, cut short near its insertion ; 10, external lateral ligament. The buccinator is a thin flat muscle extending between the alveolar margins of the jaws on each side.

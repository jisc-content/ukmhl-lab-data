(3) His dental formula is I J, C \9 P M §, M %. 23. Man differs from all members OF his ORDER except the three highest genera, the Orang {Simla), the Gorilla and Chimpanzee {Troglodytes), and the Gibbons {Hylobates), in that— (1) His sternum is of considerable breadth. (2) His metapophyses and anapophyses are very little developed. (3) His cerebrum is richly convoluted. (4) His caecum has a vermiform appendix.

[less. ELEMENTARY ANA TO MY. 408 by cords (chorda tendinece), as described in the " Elementary Physiology," Lesson II. § 10. The left auriculo-ventricular opening is guarded by two flaps, forming what is called the mitral valve, from a fancied resemblance to a bishop's mitre. The right auricle has on its left wall an oval depression called the fossa ovalis, and above and below this depression it receives blood from two large veins termed respectively the vena cava superior and inferior. Extending upwards from the margin of the opening of the last-named vessel to the fossa ovalis is a rudimentary fold of membrane termed the Eustachian valve. No other valve guards the entrance from the venae cavae into the auricle. Fig. 355.—I. The Left Side, and II. the Right Side of the Heart dissected. I. LA, the left auricle ; PV, the four pulmonary veins ; cd, a style passed through the auriculo-ventricular aperture ; MV, the mitral valve ; ab, a style passed through the left ventricle into the aorta ; RA, R V, parts of the right side ot the heart ; PA, pulmonary artery. II. RA, the right auricle ; VCS, superior vena cava ; VCI, inferio - vena cava, the stylesfe, cd, being passed through them into the auricle ; ab, style passed through the auriculo-ventricular aperture; TV, tricuspid valve; RV, right ventricle ; SL, semi-lunar valves at the base of PA, the pulmonary artery, through which the style gh is passed ; LA,LV, auricle and ventricle of the left side of the heart. The right ventricle, besides the opening between it and the right auricle, has, at its upper part, another orifice ; namely. fl.

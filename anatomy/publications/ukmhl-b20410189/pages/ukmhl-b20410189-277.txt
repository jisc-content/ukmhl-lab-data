vi.] GENERAL VIEW OF INTERNAL SKELETON. 235 The axial skeleton alone may, indeed, as in Serpents, serve the purposes of the appendicular skeleton, and become an instrument not only for climbing and swimming, but for leaping, grasping, and crushing. We have found that both categories are always present in the two highest classes (Mammals and Birds). In the Ichthy- opsida we have seen that the predominance of the axial skeleton may in some (as the Lamprey) be at its maximum, and yet that in others the appendix lar one may be greatly developed while the axial one is extremely reduced (as in the Frogs). It is the class of Birds which shows the greatest constancy in not only the existence but in the importance both of size and function of the appendicular skeleton. In them the anterior part of the axial skeleton {i.e. the cervical region and skull) is often modified by its great length and mobility to act as an elongated prehensile limb. This function is also performed by the posterior end of the axial skeleton in some Reptiles {e.g. the Chameleon), and even in some beasts, of man's own order {e.g. the Spider Monkeys), the tails of which (as has been before said) are so prehensile as to literally serve the purpose of a fifth hand.

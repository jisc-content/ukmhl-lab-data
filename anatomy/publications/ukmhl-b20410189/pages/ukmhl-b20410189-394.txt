35o [less. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. The semi-membranosus of man is small compared with that of some other animals (e.g. of the Horse and Ruminants), where it is enormous; the rump-steak of the butcher not consisting, as often supposed, and sometimes taught, of the gluteus maxi- mus, but of the semi-tendinosus and semi-membranosus. Sometimes (as eg. in the Kangaroo) this muscle is more or less completely blended with the semi-tendinosus. On the other hand it may, as in Hyrax, not only be enormous, but also arise by two heads (one from the ischium, the other from the caudal vertebrae), and have an insertion into the condyle of the femur as well as into the tibia. This muscle may, as in the Iguana, consist of two parts; one attached to the back of the leg, embracing the inner head of the gastrocnemius—some fibres passing beneath the internal lateral ligament ; the other inserted, in common with the sartorius, into the peroneal aspect of the tibia (Fig. 317). Fig. 314.—Deeper Muscles of Flexor Surface of Right Hind Leg of A, adductor ; B, biceps ; FC, femoro-caudal ; FD, flexor digitorum ; G, muscle in position more or less like the gracilis - it is cut and reflected ; 7, muscle like an iliacus ; IC, ischio-caudal ; IIC, ilio-caudal ; IP, ilio-peroneal ; SM and 6*7*. muscles like the semi-membranosus and semi-tendinosus respectively ; TA, tibialis anticus. It may, together with the preceding muscle, present what appears to be an anomalous condition, as in the Tailed-Batra- chians (e.g. Menopoma), where a muscle (Fig. 314, SM) takes origin from beneath the caudal vertebrae and blends with a Menopoma.

A vermiform appendix is very rarely found except in man. It exists, however, in the highest Apes and in the Wombat; while in the Monotremes there is a small worm-like caecum which suggests the belief that this appendix in the Wombat is but an abruptly atrophied condition of the free end of the caecum—a belief strengthened by the condition found amongst Lemuroids, which have a very long caecum, drawn out into an elongated conical termination. The caecum may bifurcate, as in the Manatee ; or there may be two small caeca, as in the Two-toed Ant-eater (Cyclothorus), or two larger ones, as in the Armadillo (Dasypus sexcinctus); or, finally, there may be—as in the Hyrax—three caeca, one at the usual situation, and two side by side projecting from the colon. A double caecum is a very! rare condition in man's class, but it is the rule in the class of Birds (Fig. 378, e). The large intestine, instead of having a form and arrange-j ment as in man, may have its various regions elongated and Fig. 379.—Section of the Stomach and part of the Intestines of a I Shark {Squalus maximus). ce, oesophagus ; c, cardiac part of the stomach ; py, its pyloric part ; s, the!J spleen ; d, the duodenum ; b, a band containing six hepatic ducts ; cA, aj dilatation in which these six ducts terminate ; z', the intestine, provided with a spiral valve. convoluted, or the whole greatly augmented in length and! reduced in diameter, and coiled in a peculiar and character-! istic manner, as e.g. in the Sheep.

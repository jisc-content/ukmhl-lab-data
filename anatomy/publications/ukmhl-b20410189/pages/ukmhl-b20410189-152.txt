ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOM K ii4 [less. The infra-orbital foramen may be multifold, as in most Apes, or may be enlarged into an enormous aperture, trans- mitting part of the masseter muscle, as is the case in the Por- cupine and some other Rodents. This great opening may exist, and yet the true infra-orbital canal be defined by a bony lamella, as in the genus Lagostomus. The palatine plate of the maxilla exists in all Mammals and in Crocodiles, yet even in Mammals it may occasionally be excessively reduced, as in the Hare. In the lower classes it is wanting.

The maxilla may acquire an enormous size, and overlap and almost entirely conceal the frontals, as in Cetaceans. Sometimes, as in Chiroinys, the maxilla is shut out from articulating with the nasal bone by the extension upwards to the frontal of that separate element of the human maxillary bone which is next to be noticed. The latter element may, sometimes, be separated by an interval from the part corresponding to the rest of the human maxilla,—as in the Three-toed Sloth. Occasionally (as in some specimens of Macacus nemes- trinus, and in the Gavial) the maxillary bone may join its fellow of the opposite side above the nasals, thus separating the latter from the frontals. Occasionally, as in some Chameleons, the maxilla may project freely forwards as a great bony horn at the front part of the face.

I.] THE SPINAL SKELETON. 67 divided into a median and two lateral processes, one on each side (as in the Apteryx) ; or into a median process and four lateral ones—there being an internal and external xiphoid process on each side of the median one—as in very many birds {e.g. gallinaceous birds, such as the Fowl and Pheasant). This median process it is which bears the keel, or the greater bart of the keel, in Birds. Fig. 77.—Thorax of a Gallinaceous Bird. r, keel of entro-sternum ; m, middle xiphoid process ; z, intermediate xiphoid process ; e, external xiphoid process ; r, rostrum; c, costal process ; k, hypa- pophysis ; a, appendage from ribs, or uncinate process. In certain animals {e.g. the Monotremes) there is a median pssicle in front of the manubrium, which is often called the ipisternum. This really forms part of the appendicular ikeleton, being a portion of the shoulder structure. It will I herefore be noticed under that head. I 35. In possessing RIBS (that is, distinct osseous or cartila- I pious parts attached at one end to the vertebral column, and l ending to surround the body cavity) man agrees with the I mmense majority of other Vertebrates. Some, however, as he Frogs and Toads, have none, nor can any be said to exist n some of the lowest Fishes, e.g. the Lamprey and its allies. J In the division of the ribs into two categories, the " true " ind the " false " ribs, man agrees with all animals which have ribs at all, except Serpents, Fishes, and Chelonians ; Serpents F 7

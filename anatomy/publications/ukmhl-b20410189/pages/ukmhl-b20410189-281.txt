239 THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. the arms are then drawn out—completely inverting the ecte- rpnic investment of each separate finger. It is then pushed back over the loins, and the legs are withdrawn, and also the feet and toes, the skin being inverted just as a glove is turned inside out. Finally the tail is pulled out, and then the whole structure being rolled up in a mass is swallowed at a gulp. It is easy, with a little patience, to shake out one of these skin-casts in water, so as to produce a complete and as it were shadowy image of the little creature that bore it. The epidermis is never converted into bone, but is often thickened and converted into horn, an approach to which we may see in man in the labourer's hand, in the sole of the foot, and in those unwelcome deposits on the toes—corns. " Horn," indeed, is but a thickened form of the very same material as that of which the minute particles we shed from the outer surface of our skin is made, and which yield the substance " gelatine " when boiled. Certain local thickenings Fig. 203.—Dorsal Surface of the Carapace of a Fresh-water 1—8, expanded neural spines ; r1- r3, expanded ribs ; 7iu, first median (or nuchal) plate ; py, last median (or pygal) plate; m, marginal scutes. The dark lines indicate the limits of the plates of the horny epidermal tortoise-shell; the thin sutures indicate the lines of junction of the bony scutes. may exist in animals, not abnormal like those above referred to in man, but constant in each species. Such thickenings are termed callosities, and may exist on the inner side of the legs, as in the Horse, or on the breast, as in the Camel, Tortoise (Emys).

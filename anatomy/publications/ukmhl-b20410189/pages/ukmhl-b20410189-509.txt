THE EXCRETORY ORGANS. XII.] LESSON XII. THE EXCRETORY ORGANS. i. In the First Lesson of " Elementary Physiology-." ยง 25. while explaining the nature of the excretory process and its Jmost general conditions, it was stated that the EXCRETORY ! ORGANS are three in number, namely : (1 . the skin: (2), the lungs ; and (3), the kidneys. The description of the skin and Its various appendages has formed the subject of our Seventh ILesson. Nevertheless, the consideration of its glandular itructure was purposely deferred to the Twelfth Lesson, and nay be here considered, with the lungs and kidneys together vith adjoined and adjacent structures not yet treated of. i The lungs, however, are importers of oxygen (for the teration of the blood) as well as excretory organs ; it is not. hen, surprising that the external skin may assume that func- tion also, as in fact we found (when considering the circulating ystem) to be the case in Batrachians. I The function of importing oxygen into the blood is per- |ormed in many animals by a set of organs of which no repre- jentative exists in man, and which, therefore, are not referred 0 in the Lessons of " Elementary Physiology,'' though they aust occupy no inconsiderable portion of our concluding Lesson of " Elementary Anatomy.*" The organs in question Imentioned in our First and Tenth Lessons) are the gills, or wanchicE. These are delicate processes of skin, richly supplied bith blood and capable of absorbing oxygen, not by the 1 ecomposition of the water in which they float, but by the bsorption of oxygen from the particles of air which are mixed p with and dissolved in that water. Such structures, as might e expected, are only found in animals which live in or 'equent water, whether fresh or salt, though not all animals [rhich frequent water have gills. Thus, in being destitute of branchiae, man agrees not only | ith the whole of his class (including, of course, the Whales

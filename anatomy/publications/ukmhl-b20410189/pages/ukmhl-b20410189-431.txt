THE NER VO US S YSTEM. 383 convolutions (commonly reckoned as the cerebellum) and ex- tending in part into the cavity of the segment of the brain in front of it. In many Teleostei {e.g. the Conger) the cor- responding structure may consist partly of a fold extending into the cavity of the more anteriorly situate cranial vesicle, partly of a great smooth median prominence behind it. 15. The cerebellum of man, like his cerebrum, greatly ex- ceeds the normal development of the part in Vertebrates generally, thus differing from the intermediate brain seg- ments which, as we have seen, are in him below the average relative development of the same parts in Vertebrates. As we descend from man we find an increase of the median portion of the cerebellum (the vermis) with a de- crease of its lateral lobes, while the flocculus on each side becomes prominent, and is (as we have seen) received in a special fossa on the surface of the petrous bone.

Complex folds, forming an arbor vitcz, are common to man's class, to Birds, and to the Crocodiles, but are wanting in lower forms. The cerebellum, even in the highest Ichthyopsida—the Frogs and Toads—is reduced to little more than a transverse band ; and it may be that it is hardly larger in Fishes, if, as has been asserted, it forms but the lower part of that great convex mass which has been usually described as the cere- bellum, and which in the Elasmobranchs is so large and convoluted, and is large but smooth in the Teleostei. If, however, as is most probably the case, the convex mass is the cerebellum, then this organ, after dwindling in size in Batra- chians, once more regains its importance as we descend to the lowest forms. Transverse fibres connecting the two lobes of the cerebel- lum on the ventral side of the medulla are wanting in Birds,

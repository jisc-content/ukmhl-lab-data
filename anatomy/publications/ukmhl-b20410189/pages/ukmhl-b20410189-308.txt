ELEMENTAR Y ANA TOMY. [less. 29. The TRUE MOLARS are very rarely more numerous than in man, who has the typical number of the great (Monodel- phous) division of his class. In the Marsupials (Didelphous Mammals), however, there are typically four above and four below. They may (even where pre-molars are present) be quite wanting in the upper jaw, while there is but one on each side (and that very small) of the lower jaw, as in the Cats. 30. The form of the human true molars, both above and below, will readily serve to explain the more general modifi- cations present in man's class. The peculiar form of the upper molar—namely, four cusps, one at each angle, with the before described oblique con- CYMNURA Fig. 235.—Grinding Surface of a Left Upper Molar. a, antero-external cusp ; b, antero-internal cusp ; cy postero external cusp ; d, postero-internal cusp. The oblique ndge is seen passing from the postero external cusp to the antero- internal one. necting ridge—reappears not only in some of the Apes, but in other beasts, as e.g. in the Hedgehog and its ally, Gymmira. A "band" of dental substance (termed the cingiilnvi) may surround the tooth, and even in man's own order (Primates) Fig. 236.—Grinding Surface of a Left Upper Molar. a and b, anterior cusps ; c, postero-evternal cusp ; 1, 2, 3, and 4, the four acces- sory cusps of the external cingulum. may develop small accessory cusps which project downwards external to the two outer of the four principal cusps. By further development the external cusps of the band may

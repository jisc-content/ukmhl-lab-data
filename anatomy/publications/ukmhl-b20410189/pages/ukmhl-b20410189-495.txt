THE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. XI.] 447 The proportion as to length borne by the small intestine to the large is generally in Mammals less than in man, in whom it is as five to one ; but the large intestine may be very short (not more than a tenth the length of the body), as in most Birds ; it may be, on the contrary, actually the longer portion of the intestine, as in the Ostrich. The presence of a caecum is not quite constant in man's class, and this structure is never found in Fishes, though it is often present in Reptiles, and generally in Birds. In Fishes, Fig. 378.—Visceea of the common Fowl. ■e, oesophagus ; cp, crop ; pr, proventriculus ; g, gizzard ; /, liver ; gb, gall-bladder ; P, pancreas ; d, loop of the duodenum enclosing the pancreas; si, small intes- tine ; /z, large intestine ; e, cseca ; o, oviduct; u, ureter.—The cloaca is cut open and some feathers are represented attached to its margin. ndeed, there are often many caecal appendages to the intestine, but these will be noticed below in describing the pancreas. I In man's class the caecum often presents an inverse degree if size and complexity compared with the stomach. It may •e enormous, as in the Indris, the Hare, the Galeopithecus, tie Koala, and the Horse. It may be very simple and short,

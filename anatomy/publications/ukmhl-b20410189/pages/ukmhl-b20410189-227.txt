In its natural position, when the foot is on the ground, the upper surface of the body of the astragalus is nearly hori- zontal for articulation with the under surface of the shaft of the tibia. Two other articular surfaces, almost at right angles with the former, join the two malleoli respectively.

The anterior part of the bone is prolonged forwards as its neck, ending in a rounded, con- vex, articular surface (the head), which fits into the hinder surface of the naviculare.

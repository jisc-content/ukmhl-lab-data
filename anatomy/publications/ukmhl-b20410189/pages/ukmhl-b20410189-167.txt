THE CRANIAL SKELETON. III.] 129 Sirenia, and the Cetacea, they look upwards, and open quite on the superior aspect of the skull. The same may be said of those animals with a short proboscis, the Tapirs and the Saiga Antelope. The occiput may slope so forward that much more of it may be seen (when the skull is viewed from above) than in man, as is the case, e.g., in the Cape Mole (Chrysochloris), the Elephant, and the Porpoise. It may, on the contrary, be hidden by the projection of a large lambdoidal crest, as in the Gorilla and Hysena.

It is possible that this region may be in large part mem- branous, as in some Rays. On the contrary, great bony productions may exist, as in Ruminants ; either permanent bony cores sheathed with horn as in the Ox, Goat, &c, or else bony developments (antlers) which are annual in their growth and decay. There may be four bony cores, as in the existing little four- horned Antelope and in the great extinct Sivatherium. The roof of the cranium may falsely appear to be large and smooth, as in the Turtle and in the Rodent Lcphiomys. In them the real skull is disguised by the outgrowth of bony 'lamellae, which, meeting together, arch over the temporal fossae, land make the skull look capacious when it is not really so. f The inferior region is very rarely divisible into the three K

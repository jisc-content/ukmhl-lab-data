In the Rhinoceros, Horse, and the Ruminants, the essential structure of the Tapir's tooth persists, but is modified by- greater and greater obliquity of the transverse ridges and by the development of supplementary processes running more or less at right angles to the transverse ridges. Fig. 243.—Grinding Surface ok Second Upper Molar of a Camel, showing the double crescentic folds which have their convexities turned inwards. In the Ruminants the transverse ridges are so much in- clined backwards and inwards, that they come to be almost parallel with the external wall, thus forming the well-known double crescents with a deep excavation between them seen in the molars of Sheep. In the Horse this excavation is filled up with " cement," and the pattern is complicated by the development of acces- sory processes from the convex, or inner side of the trans- verse ridges.

In the insectivorous type these modifications result in a pair of triangular prisms (produced by the con- nection by ridges of the five cusps answering to the five cusps developed in the lower molar of man) ending in sharp points, as in the Mole ; or in a single prism, as in the Golden Mole, Chrysochloris. The prisms are reversed in position as com-

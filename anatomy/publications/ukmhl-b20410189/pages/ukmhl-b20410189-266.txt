ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY. [less. 224 1 See Lesson XII. (3) An inferior cylinder, external to the pleuro-peritoneal cavity, and segmented (ribs, &c.)—paraxial parts. These may be subdivided into two series :— (a) Tubercular processes (diapop/iyses) and upper ribs. (b) Capitular processes (parapop/iyses), lower ribs, sternal ribs, and sternum. These two series generally, as in man, coalesce, and the component parts may have various relations of position to the body and neural arch from which they spring. (4) An inferior cylinder, internal to the pleuro-peritoneal cavity, or directly above the origin of the internal walls of that cavity—hypaxial parts. These may be subdivided into three possible series, two of which are known to be actually developed as hard parts :— (a) Parts above the alimentary cavity or its prolongation, and in relation to the great blood-vessel immediately below the central axis (hypapophyses). {b) Parts bounding externally the alimentary canal {splanchnapophyses ). (c) Parts bounding externally the heart or great vessels, but of course internal to the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. Hypapophyses are most largely developed in Cetaceans and Fishes, such as the Sole. Splanchnapophyses are only formed in the region of the head and immediately behind it, and form the trabeculae, the jaws, and the hyoidean and branchial arches. Sometimes, as in the Lamprey, splanchnapophyses may be absent as hard parts, but in the region where they would Fig. 194.—Skeleton of Head and Gills of Lamprey. i>, hinder part of the external (paraxial) cartilaginous skeleton of the gills; am auditory capsule; h, hyoid ; u, neural arches ; fi, palato-quadrate arch. be developed, if at all, we find a system of paraxial cartilages, bounding the gill chambers externally.1

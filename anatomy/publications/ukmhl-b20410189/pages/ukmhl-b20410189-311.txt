THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. VII.] 267 of the front, inner cusp of man—the hind inner one having disappeared. In the true molars of the Dog this last cusp reappears, and in addition we find a large prominence of the internal part of the cingulum. In the Badger this latter structure is very much developed, extending in a marked manner along the Fig. 241.—Grinding Surface of First Right Upper Molar Tooth of m Ailurus fulgens. 1, 2, 3, and 4, cusps of the external cingulum ; ic, internal cingulum ; a, b, c, and d, the four principal cusps. whole inner margin of the tooth. In Ailurus we have a good example of the maximum of complexity of the carni- vorous type of molar. We find in the molar of this animal four principal cusps, with three cusps belonging to the external cingulum, and two belonging to the internal cingulum. Returning now to the type of structure exhibited by man's upper molar, we may follow through another series of ani- mals yet a new chain of modifications, resulting in a very different kind of complication. First, one transverse ridge may connect the two posterior Fig. 242,—Grinding Surface of \ eft Upper Molar, showing the transverse ridges (convex forwards) which connect together the anterior and posterior pairs of principal cusps respectively ; a, b, c, and d, the four principal cusps. cusps, and another may similarly unite the two anterior cusps. We see this in the Kangaroo and Macroscelides. Next, a ridge may run along the external margin of the tooth (probably the cingulum) and connect together the two MACROSCELIDES b

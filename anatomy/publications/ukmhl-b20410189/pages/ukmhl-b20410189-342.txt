Above, this muscle is connected with the pectoralis major. The deeper abdominal muscle, the internal oblique, is re- presented by membrane only in the mid-ventral region. It passes from the ilium and adjacent structures, up towards Fig. 274.—Deeper Abdominal Muscles—the external oblique being removed from the left side of the body, and the internal oblique and part of the rectus also, from its right side. 1, the internal oblique ; its outer tendon (2) is cut and reflected from the outside of the rectus to show its deeper tendon (3), which passes within the rectus except towards the pubis ; 4, transversalis ; 5, its fascia ; 6, sheath of the-, rectus —near the pubis, the conjoined aponeuroses of the abdominal muscles pass in front of that muscle ; 7, pyramidalis ; 8, rectus of left side, showing the tendinous intervals, or linece transverse?. the cartilages of the ribs, its fibres mostly proceeding in the reverse direction to those of the muscle last described. The deepest of the abdominal muscles, the transversalis, springs from the ilium and lower ribs, and its fibres,.proceed- ing horizontally, end in an aponeurosis, which meets its fellow in the mid-ventral line. The abdominal nerves extend round the body between this muscle and the internal oblique. Rectus abdominis. This is a long muscle which, springing from the pubis, ascends to the cartilages of the fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs. The rectus is separated from its fellow of

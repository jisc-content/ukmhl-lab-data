[less. ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. 30O tion, as explained in the Fourth Lesson of " Elementary Physiology." It is a partly fibrous, partly muscular partition between the thorax and abdomen, perforated for the passage of certain organs—namely, the oesophagus, or swallow, and two great blood-vessels named aorta and vena cava. The diaphragm is strongly convex upwards and concave down- wards, and is attached to the ensiform cartilage and several ribs, to the centra of the lumbar vertebrae, and to fibrous structure binding down the quadratus lumborum and other muscles. Muscular towards its circumference, the diaphragm has a tendinous central portion.

The MUSCLES OF THE INFERIOR EXTREMITY, though mainly taking origin from the pelvis and leg-bones, yet partly arise from the loins. Thus the psoas magnus springs from the centra of the lumbar and last dorsal vertebrae, and from the transverse processes of the former. Passing out over the brim of the pelvis, it is inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur. The iliacus occupies the iliac fossa of the pelvis, whence it descends and joins the psoas magnus. The psoas parvus springs from the bodies of the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae, and is inserted into the ilio-pecti- neal eminence. The gluteus maximus is a very large muscular mass which arises from the posterior part of the crest of the ilium, the

It gives off a tube, or duct, which runs forward outside the masseter muscle, and then turns inwards, piercing the buccinator muscle and cheek, so as to open into the mouth opposite the second upper premolar. (2) The sub-maxillary glands are next in size, and one on each side is placed within the lower part of the mandible and above the digastric muscle. Its duct runs forward and opens (close to its fellow of the opposite side) beside the fold of skin which attaches the under surface of the tongue to the flcoi c-f Fig. 371.—A Dissection of the Right Side of the Face. fi, the sublingual ; b} the submaxillary glands, with their ducts opening beside the tongue in the floor of the mouth at di c, the parotid gland and its duct, which opens on the side of the cheek at e. the mouth. (3) The sub-lingual glands are still smaller, and jare placed in the floor of the mouth, between the tongue and the gum of the lower jaw. They open by numerous minute 'duets. Besides these considerable structures, the mucous mem- jbrane which lines the mouth is beset with minute buccal Inlands. 5. On extending our view over man's sub-kingdom, we see hat salivary glands may be entirely absent, as is the case in nost Fishes, in Crocodiles, and in the Cetacea. Only in man's :lass do we find definite glands of all the three kinds above (lescribed, though very generally salivary glandular structures

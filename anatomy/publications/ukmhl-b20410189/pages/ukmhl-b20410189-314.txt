Fig. 246.—Upper and Lower Jaws (seen from behind) of an Eagle Ray (Myliobatis), showing the elongated median dental plates and the hexagonal lateral plates. One of the most singular modifications in the form of a tooth is presented by the poison-fangs of Serpents. It is a common thing for a tooth to exhibit a vertical groove: we see it even in the canines of Apes ; and in some extinct forms (e.g. Ichthyosaurus) the teeth were furnished with a number of such grooves. In poisonous Serpents, however—^, the Rattlesnake—one large tooth on each side of the upper jaw has an exceedingly deep, vertical, anterior groove, the margins of which groove bend over till they meet and thus form a canal which opens Fig. 247.—Side View of the Skull of a Rattlesnake (Crotalus), showing the large poison-fang implanted in the maxilla—in front of the letters mx. a, articular bone of lower jaw ; bo, basi-occipital ; d, dentary; f, frontal \f\ pre-frontal; me, median ethmoid ; mx, maxilla ; o, pro-otic ; parietal ; pa, para-sphenoid ; pt, pterygoid ; px, pre-maxilla ; qu, quadrate ; qs, squamosal. widely above, but by a very small aperture below. It is down this channel that the poison is poured, the tube leading from the poison-gland opening into the upper part of the canal.

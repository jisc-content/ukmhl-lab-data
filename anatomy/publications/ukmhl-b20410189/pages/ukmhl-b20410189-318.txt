The best example of great complexity of structure of a Mammalian tooth is that exhibited by one of the molars of the Indian Elephant. Such a tooth consists of a number of narrow transverse plates of dentine, each plate being capped with enamel, and the interspaces between the plates being filled up with a quantity of cement, as if this material had been poured round and between the plates, and had there solidified. As the tooth wears, it assumes the transversely ridged appearance before noticed, which is an effect of the different densities of the component tissues. Thus the enamel, being harder than either the dentine or the cement, stands up a little along each front and hind, d Fig. 252.—Grinding Surface of Lower Molar of Indian Elephant. {After Owen.) d, c/, two of the vertical plates of "dentine'1 (each surrounded by "enamel"), which are connected together by the "cement." margin of each transverse plate; and in this way, proceeding from either end of the tooth along its grinding surface, we successively meet with layers thus arranged : — Cement, enamel, dentine, enamel, cement, enamel, dentine, enamel, cement, &c. r I.e. may be more or less permeated by canals for nutritive fluid, which are larger than the dentinal tubes existing in man.

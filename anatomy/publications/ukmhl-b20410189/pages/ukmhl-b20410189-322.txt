Besides scales, spines, and plates, Fishes have other dermal STRUCTURES, bony or gristly, constantly present within the dermis. One kind consists of filamentary pro- cesses, which may be either horny or calcareous, and which Fig. 258.—Dorsal Fin of an Acan- thopterygian Fish, showing the firm, spiny fin-rays, f> supported on the inter-spinous bones, i.

Such structures are termed fin-rays. Another kind consists of the parts (bony or gristly) which support the fin-rays, and which are termed the "inter- spinous" bones or cartilages. These may be seen in the common Sole in the form of small bones extending along each margin of the body beyond the ends of the neura- pophysial and hypapophysial processes which respectively project in opposite directions from the centre of the backbone. 1 From kukXoc, a circle, and ei^og, form. 2 From KTet£, a comb, and ei'6o£.

[less. 40 ELEMENTAR Y ANA TO MY. notochord, as in some Elasmobranchs, or to mere cartila- ginous rudiments in its sheath. Sometimes (as in the first coccygeal vertebra of the croco- dile) a vertebra may be bi-convex, or have a ball at each end ; and very rarely two prominences or two hollows may exist side by side on one surface of a centrum, as in some cervical vertebrae of Chelonians. The articulating processes (zygapophyses) are very con- stant structures, and are substantially as in man, except that Fig. 49.—Lateral View of four Trunk-Vertebrae of Siren. ct capitular process ; t, tubercular process ; i, interzygapophysial ridge. in fishes they cannot be said to articulate truly. A strong interzygapophysial ridge may connect together the pre- and post-zygapophyses of each side of a vertebra, as in Siren. The transverse processes are structures too complex to be more than referred to under this general heading. The conditions exhibited by them in man are such as obtain generally, but by no means universally, in Verte- brates above fishes. Two transverse processes may be developed from each side of the same vertebra and in the same plane. This may be seen in the posterior coc- cygeal vertebras of Apes and other Mammals, and at least occasionally in some verte- bras of Polypterus.

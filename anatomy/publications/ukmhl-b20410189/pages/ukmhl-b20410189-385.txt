VIII.] THE MUSCLES. 34* representative in man. Such a muscle is the femoro-caudal of Reptiles, Birds, and Tailed-Batrachians. This {e.g. in the Iguana and Chameleon) arises beneath the caudal vertebrae, and, though mainly inserted into the femur, sends on a deli- cate tendon which, passing down, is inserted into the articular cartilage between the femur and tibia.

Milne-Edwards.) Gluteus maximus. This muscle is of very exceptional size in man, directly related as it is to his erect attitude. Never- theless, it may be yet greater relatively in some quadrupeds than it is in him, as e.g. in the Echidna, where it is double, and where part passes from the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae downwards to the ankle, and represents that part of the muscle which in man is inserted into the fascia lata, while another portion with a similar origin is inserted into the femur. The muscle exists in Birds and in Reptiles. In the Chameleon (Fig. 311) it passes from the caudal vertebrae to the tendinous arch going from the posterior margin of the ilium to the tuberosity of the so-called ischium. This muscle may be inserted into the whole length of the femur, as in the Seal. The gluteus medius is very often much thicker and larger than the gluteus maximus. This is the case, e.g., in the Horse, where it is twelve times as big as the maximus. It may arise not only from the ilium but from the sacral and even from the lumbar vertebral spines, as in the Echidna. The muscle ap- pears to be almost a constant one, as it exists, well-developed,

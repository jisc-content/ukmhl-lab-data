THE crania:, skeleton. III.] 93 In the substance of the frontal bone, just above the nasals, jare, almost always, certain cavities filled with air, called the frontal sinuses. These communicate with the nasal fossa? below, through the middle turbinals. The body of the sphenoid and the maxillae also contain large air-holding cavities, termed the sphenoidal and max- illary sinuses, and opening respectively beneath the upper land middle turbinals into the nasal fossae. 17. In development the first appearance of the future skull is indicated by the expansion of the anterior end of the primitive groove before spoken of.

This expansion becomes subdivided by two lateral con- tractions (one in front of the other, on each side), so that three rounded cavities are produced, one behind, one above, and one in front of the anterior termination of the noto- chord—the primitive skull being sharply bent down just in front of the anterior termination of the notochord. In the walls of these rounded expansions, or vesicles, no quadrate thickenings occur similar to those which are de-

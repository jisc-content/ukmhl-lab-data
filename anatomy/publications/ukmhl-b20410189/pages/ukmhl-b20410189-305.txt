261 VII.] THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. The same is the case in some Mammals of other orders, as in the Ox, Deer, and Sheep ; as also in the extinct Ele- phant-like creature Dinotherium, which had only two in- cisors, but these extended downwards from the front end of the lower jaw. Incisors may be present in the form of enormous tusks in the upper jaw but wanting altogether in the lower, as in the Elephant. They may similarly be present in the upper jaw only, but exhibit a flat grinding surface flush with the gum, as in the Walrus. The upper incisors may be separated by an interval from their fellows of the opposite side, as in Loris. 2 3 Fig. 231.—Front View of Upper Incisors and Canines of three genera or Slow Lemurs (natural size). 1, Loris; 2, Nycticebus; 3, Perodicticus. The front lower incisor may be enormous, and represent, by its notched outline, several incisors fused into one. More- over with age the teeth may become anchylosed to the jaw.

These peculiarities are exhibited by the Shrew-Mice, which, as before remarked, are not " mice " at all, but closely allied to the Mole and Hedgehog. Generally having but a single fang, whether with or without a permanent pulp, an incisor tooth may yet have a double fang, as is the case in the Flying Lemur and in Peirodromus. 26. The CANINE TEETH of man. as their name implies, find in the Dog (and other flesh-eating beasts) an enlarged repre- sentative, as also in the Apes. Such tusks, however, are far

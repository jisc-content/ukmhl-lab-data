431 THE CIRCULATING SYSTEM. X.] The lacteals end in the lower part of the thoracic duct. Lymphatic glands are scattered in various parts of the body, but those most readily observed in man are the glands in the arm-pit, the groin, and the sides of the neck. Fig. 369.â€”The Thoracic Duct. The Thoracic Duct occupies the middle of the figure. It lies upon the spinal column, at the sides of which are seen portions of the ribs. At the bottom of the figure the psoas muscles appear. a, the receptacle of the chyle ; b. the trunk of the thoracic duct, opening at c into the junction of the left jugular (_/) and subclavian (g) veins as they unite into the left innominate vein ; e, the right innominate vein formed by the union of the left jugular and subclavian veins ; d, lymphatic glands placed in the lumbar and intercostal regions ; h, k, the cut cesophagus. Two veins are seen running alongside the lower part of the thoracic duct, and, just above its middle,one (the left) crosses under the duct and joins the other. These are the azygos veins. Xo part of the lymphatic system of man is rh\thmically contractile. 13. In surveying this system by the light furnished by the anatomy of other Vertebrates, we find that its condition may

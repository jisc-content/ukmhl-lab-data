THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. VII.] 279 38. Lastly may be noticed certain exceptional though not unfamiliar structures which come perhaps more conveniently under the head of the exo-skeleton than elsewhere—namely, the BONY HORNS OF ungulates. In the Oxen, Goats, and their allies, horns exist on the head as bony cores persisting throughout life, and supporting the hollow horns before noticed under the head of " Epidermal Structures." In the Giraffe we meet with three bony prominences which arise as distinct ossifications, and only later anchylose with the skull. These are the pair of short " horns " and the median pro- minence in front of them. They are without doubt exo- skeletal structures. In Deer, however, we meet with bony antlers which are shed annually and are destitute of any horny covering. These may exist in both sexes, as in the Reindeer, but generally in the males only. They arise as Fig. 260.—Sekies of Anti.ers of the Common Stag, showing (from No. t to No. 8) the gradual increase (with age J of size and complexity in the antlers developed.

In some months the investing skin dries up and is rubbed away, and the horn itself falls off after the breeding season, leaving a stump, whence it shoots again in the following year. Antlers, as a rule, are branched—more so as the individual is older till maturity be attained.

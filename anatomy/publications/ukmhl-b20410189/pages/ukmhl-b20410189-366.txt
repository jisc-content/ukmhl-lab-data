[LESS. ELEMENTARY ANATOMY, 322 man shares with his class, but which may have no distinct representative in non-mammalian forms which are higher than Batrachians, e.g. in the Iguana. The splenitis colli is present only in a few Mammals. The erector spina presents in man a degree of differentia- tion not generally found in animals below his class. Thus in the Iguana and Chameleon it is but divisible into the longi- tudinal parts answering respectively to the longissimus aorsi Fig. ago.— Deeper Muscles of Outer Side of hinder part of Trunk and ANTERIOR PART OF TAIL, AND OF THE DORSAL (EXTENSOR) SlDE OF RlGHT Pelvic Limb of Menobranchus—the gluteus maximus, rectus lemons, and extensor longus digitorum being cut and reflected.

But a greater simplicity still may exist, as in Tailed-Batrachians (e.g. Menopoma and Menobranchus), where, without the intervention of any such neck muscles, a sinvDlc, or more or less tendinously intersected muscular mass extends from the skull directly to the end of the dorsum of the tail. This dorsal muscle may be reduced to a mere rudi-

[less. 44 ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. suture with each other and with similarly expanded ribs, to form the " shell93 or carapace. These plates are so externally situate as to be invested only by a horny form of skin. Fig. 57.—Dorsal Surface of a Shell of a Fresh-water Tortoise (Emys). 1—8, expanded neural spines; rl—r2, expanded ribs. (The dark lines indicate the plates of the horny investment of the skeleton.) The transverse processes generally articulate with the tubercles of the ribs, while the sides of the bodies bear the heads of the ribs. This mode of articulation, however, is not constant even in man's own class, as in the posterior thoracic vertebrae of the ordinary Dolphins, where there are no surfaces for the heads of ribs, the ribs are attached to the ends of the transverse processes only ; while in the Sperm Whale group (Physeteridce) the ribs are attached exclusively to parts which answer to the capitular surfaces of man. The notches for the spinal nerves, as has been said, are not constant structures, but sometimes are replaced by direct perforations of the neural laminae. The flatness of the surfaces of the vertebral bodies in man is a condition constant in his class, but in Birds these surfaces are concave in one direction and convex in another. A ball and socket or a bi-concave articulation is to be found in yet lower forms. That the only articular vertebral processes are the zygapophyses, is a character man shares with most of his

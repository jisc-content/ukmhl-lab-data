ELEMENTARY ANA TOMY. [less. 2IO (From Flower s " Osteology.") It may be that the metatarsals coalesce with the distal part of the tarsus, as in Birds, the Chameleon, and Brady pus. Metatarsals may coexist each with only one if any phalanx, as in Ophiodes. The first metatar- sals may widely diverge from the line of the others, as in non- human Primates, and in some Marsupials, e.g. Phalangista. A more complete divergence or opposition, however, may or as in the Chameleon, where the are Fig. 180.—Rudimentary Pelvic Extremity of Ophiodes. ft fibula ; t, tibia. {After Fiirbringer.) exist, as in most Birds ; two tibial metatarsals opposed to the three peroneal ones ; or as in Parrots, where the first and fourth are op- posed to the second and third. In the number of these bones and their sub-equality of development man agrees with a great number of Verte- brates above Fishes. Never- theless, the number may be much reduced, and the pro- portions of the several bones may vary in different modes. Thus there may be but a single metatarsal, the third, with rudiments of the second and fourth, as in the Horse ; or but a single large one, the fourth, with the second, third, and fifth metatarsals very small, as in Cheer opiis. There may be but a single bone, which consists of the third and fourth fused to- gether, as in the Sheep, Deer, &c, and in the Ostrich ; or of second, third, and fourth fused together, as in the Jerboa and the Emeu ; or of these and the first also, as in many Birds.

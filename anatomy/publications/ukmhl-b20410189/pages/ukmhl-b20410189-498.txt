ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [LESS. 45° entering the intestine in advance of the entrance of the biliary secretion. An essential similarity exists m the pancreas, not only of Reptiles but also of Batrachians ; and yet in Fishes this organ appears to be replaced by quite another structure. In most bony Fishes there* are several, or many, caecal pouches attached to the commencement of the alimentary canal. These may be but two in number, as in the Turbot; or there Fig. 381.—Digestive Organs of a Sword-fish {Xiphias gladius). I, liver; £, cardiac part of the stomach ; Py, its pyloric part ; P, pyloric caeca massed into a body like the conglome- rate pancreas of Mammals ; z, intes- tine.

They may be all distinct, or they may be agglomerated together into a sort of solid gland (showing a certain resemblance to the pancreas of higher animals), as in the Sword-fish. The pancreas may be altogether wanting, as in the Lancelet. , 14. The liver of man, the largest gland in his body, has been noticed in the Fifth Lesson of " Elementary Physiology," vj 20

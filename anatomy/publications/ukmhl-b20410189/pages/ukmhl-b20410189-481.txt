XI.] THE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. * LESSON XL THE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. 1. The alimentary system of man has been in great part described in the Sixth Lesson of " Elementary Phy- siology," §§ 13—22. Here, however, a certain amount of recapitulation seems necessary for clearness. This system begins, as all know, at the mouthy which is. furnished with lips and a tongue, and which opens behind into the swallow (or pharynx), which, by means pf the gulled (or oesophagus), leads down into the stomach, from which a long and very tortuous canal (the intestine) continues onwards to the termination of the alimentary tube or cavity. The alimentary tube, from the lips downwards, has various fluids poured into it in different parts of its course, and these fluids are secreted {i.e. extracted from the blood) by certain organs termed glands. Thus spittle is poured into the mouth by " salivary glands." " Gastric glands " supply their secretion, the gastric juice, to the stomach. A second set of spittle glands, the pancreas, pour the fluid they form into the intestine ; and that vast organ, the liver, also pours into the alimentary canal its special formation, the bile. As has been already said, peculiar lymphatic vessels — the lacteals — collect nutritive fluid from the alimentary canal and convey it into the blood. All the alimentary organs below the diaphragm—namely the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas—are invested by a fold of delica,te serous membrane, which also lines the inner wall of the whole abdominal cavity, thus forming a very large sac, folded in an exceedingly complex manner and contain- ing a serous fluid. This complex serous sac, by which the viscera are attached (as in a sling) to the front wall of the vertebral column, is called the peritoneum. 2.

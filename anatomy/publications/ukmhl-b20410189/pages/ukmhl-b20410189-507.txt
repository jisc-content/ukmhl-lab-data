459 XI.] THE ALIMENTARY SYSTEM. Fishes. It may have a silvery metallic lustre, as often in the last-named class. It may, as in Birds, form great cells which communicate with the lungs, and thence become inflated with air. The peritoneum may be incomplete, being reduced, as it were by local atrophy, to shreds and patches, as in many -cartilaginous Fishes, e.g. the Sturgeon. Instead of an omentum passing post-axially as in Mam- mals, two such structures may extend pre-axially {i.e. towards the head) from the oelvic region, as in many Lizards.

[After Pittard.) ns, neural spine ; c, neural canal; outer surface of body ; f, peritoneum lining the body-cavity and investing the viscera ; a} the aorta ; s, the spleen ; g, the stomach ; h, the gall-duct; f the falciform ligament of the liver ; r, the pleuro- peritoneal cavity. The whole intestine {i.e. both the great and small intes- tines) may be suspended by one continuous mesentery, even in man's own class, as in the Shrew and the Elephant. 17. In the DEVELOPMENT of the alimentary system the first notable modification is the splitting of the laminae ven- trales, as already mentioned. When by the ventral union of the inner laminse the alimentary canal is formed, this canal is at first a straight tube closed at both ends, and extending along the ventral aspect of the axial skeleton. After a time the tube, towards the middle of the body, bends away from this axis in a sharp ventral curve, while that part jof it on the pre-axial side (side next the head) of the curve I dilates and becomes the stomach. The part on the post- I axial side of the curve becomes the transverse colon, while Ithe intervening loop becomes greatly lengthened and exces- sively convoluted to form the small intestine and ascending i:olon, a little bud-like offshoot laying the foundation of the :aecum, As we have seen, this proximity of the transverse

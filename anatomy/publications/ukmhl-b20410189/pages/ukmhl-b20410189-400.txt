354 ELEMENTARY ANATOMY. [less. in many forms, e.g. Hyrax, pass behind and beneath it into the plantar fascia. The soleus, even in Nycticebus, has lost its tibial attach- ment, is entirely muscular, and blends with the gastro- cnemius. It may (as in the Agouti) arise from the tibia only; it may be inserted into the astragalus, as in the Ornitho- rhynchus ; or it may be wanting, as in. the Pig, Hyaena, Seal, and others.

Plantaris. This muscle may be altogether absent, as in the Wombat. It may however be present as a large belly, and arise from the outer condyle "of the femur, as in the Pig and Rabbit. It may also, as in the same animals, end in an expansion which runs along the sole and becomes the per- forated tendons of the digits. This muscle may be con- nected even with the pelvis by the intervention of the rectus femoris, the tendon of which is continued on into it, not only in Birds but also in the Alligator. It may be intimately connected with the outer head of the gastrocnemius, and fleshy bellies may replace the perforated tendons, as in the Iguana. The pop lite us may arise from the head of the fibula, even in man's own class, e.g. in the Echidna, where it extends far

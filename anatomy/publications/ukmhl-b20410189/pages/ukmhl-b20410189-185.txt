SKELETON OF UPPER LIMB. M7 IV.] ossification. The coracoid ossification contributes to form the glenoid cavity. . 3. The clavicle is a long cylindrical bone with a slightly sigmoid curvature, placed transversely on each side of the neck and connecting the acromion with the manubrium of the sternum. Its outer end, in childhood, bears a cartilage, termed the meso-scapular cartilage (which ultimately ossifies), and is connected with the acromion by a synovial joint. The inner end has a distinct centre of ossification (as an epiphysis), and unites with the sternum by a joint in which is interposed a fibro-cartilage (the omosternum) having a synovial membrane on each side of it. The clavicle is connected with the coracoid by ligament only. . 4. The HUMERUS (os humeri) is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb, and extends from the shoulder to the elbow- joint. It is imperfectly cylindri- cal, with an expansion at each end. We may consider it in the position in which it is placed when the arm is dependent and the palm turned forwards. The cylindrical part (or shaft) has its anterior surface marked above by a longitudinal depres- sion, termed the bicipital groove, because it lodges the tendon of a muscle called the Biceps. Below and external to this is a roughened elevated tract for the insertion of the deltoid muscle. The lower part of the shaft as its anterior surface sepa- ated from the posterior surface >y two lines (or ridges), one on :ach s:de, which become well marked as they approach the ower end of the bone. The outer of these two ridges is ermed the supinator, or external condyloid, ridge (for reasons which will appear), while the inner one is named the internal |;ondyloid, or pronator ridge.

'Even in man's own class, parts so remote from the heart as the veins adjacent to the fingers may become rhythmically contractile under special circumstances, as we have seen with regard to the Bat's wing. . . The connexion between the systemic and pulmonary circulation takes place in all higher Vertebrates, as m man,! i.e. only in the heart—its confusion in lower forms has just] been mentioned.

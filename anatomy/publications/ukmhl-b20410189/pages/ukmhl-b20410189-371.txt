3-7 VIII.] THE MUSCLES. Echidna) exclusively arise from the external surface of the scapula. The coraco-brachialis of man does not normally exhibit the complexity of structure which it may exhibit in some other Mammals. Thus, in addition to the part usually developed in man (namely, that descending to about the middle of the shaft of the humerus), we may have a shorter part inserted above the tendon of the teres major and con- nected with the capsular ligament (as in the Bonnet Monkey and many other species), and a third part descending right down to the internal condyloid ridge of the humerus, as in the Echidna, in Lemur, Iguana (Fig. 296), and others. Fig. 294.â€”Muscles of Inside of Right Arm of Iguana (seen in front), the pectoralis and deltoid being cut short and reflected. B, bicepy; BA, brachialis anticus ; CB 1 and CB3, coraco-brachialis; D1 and D2, deltoid; EH, muscles perhaps answering to the subclavius; IS, infra- spinatus ; P, pectoralis ; SCM, sterno-cleido-mastoid ; T3, triceps. The biceps as it exists in man is a fair exponent of its normal condition, at least in his class. This muscle, however, may arise from but a single head, which may take origin from the scapula only, as in the Pig, or from the coracoid only, as in the Echidna and the Iguana. Its insertion may take place both into the ulna and radius, as in the Pig, and the two tendons of insertion may divide, allowing the brachialis anticus to pass between them, as in the Chameleon. This muscle may arise even from the sternum, as in the Frog. Brachialis anticus. This is rather short in man. It may be divided into two parts, as in the Agouti. It may be more or less confounded with the biceps, as in Iguana, Menopojna, and Menobranchus.

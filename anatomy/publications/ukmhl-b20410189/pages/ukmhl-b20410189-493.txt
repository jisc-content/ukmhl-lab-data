Another and an exceedingly exceptional condition of the stomach may exist, as e.g. in the blood-sucking Bat Des- modus. Here we have the cardiac end produced into an enormously prolonged pouch, while the pyloric part is re- duced to a rudiment—the highly nutritious food (blood) requiring very little digestion, but needing a large chamber for its speedy reception. ^'IG- 377-—Stomach and adjacent Viscera of the Bat Desmodus. {After Huxley.) ce, oesophagus ; ca, cardiac part of the stomach enormously elongated to cd, the cardiac caecum ; pyy short pyloric part of the stomach ; /, liver ; s, spleen. Instead of being prolonged, the stomach may be very much shorter than in man, and indeed its depth may exceed its length, as is the case in the Ornithorhynchus and some Insectivora, e.g. Rhynchocyon. It may also be globular, as in the Fish Mormyrus. Special glandular structures may exist which have no representatives in man. Thus, as in the Rodent Lophiomys, there may be a glandular offshoot from the stomach—near the pylorus., Again, there may be (as in the Wombat and Beaver) a glandular mass within the stomach, situated be- tween the oesophageal and pyloric apertures. Finally, there may be (as in the Dugong) a complex gland within the cardiac fundus, formed by a membrane which is spirally arranged below, but radiating above.

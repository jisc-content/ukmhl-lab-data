VII.] 271 THE EXTERNAL SKELETON. 32. The succession of the teeth which we meet with in man is characteristic of most animals of his class, but not all. In many, as in the Guinea-pig, the so-called milk- Fig. 248.—Vertical, Longitudinal Section of the Poison-fang of a Serpent. {After Owen. ) g, deep groove ; <?, its lower termination, which affords exit to the poison ; p, pulp-cavity. teeth are shed even before birth.

Thus, in the Ungulates they persist till the adult form is reached, and, at least in some, till after the bony elements of the limb-girdles have completely coalesced. Sometimes teeth are formed which are not destined to cut the gum, and are re-absorbed without ever becoming visible. This is the case with the upper incisor teeth of Ruminants. In the Whalebone Whales, before the develop- ment of baleen, minute teeth are developed in the dental groove, which teeth are ultimately absorbed while the groove itself becomes obliterated. In the Marsupial Mammals but a single tooth is provided with a vertical predecessor. This tooth is the one which ; would be the fourth pre-molar were the normal number de- veloped, and it thus serves to define the last of the pre-inolars.

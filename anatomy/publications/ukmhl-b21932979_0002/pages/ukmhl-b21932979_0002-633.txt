SECTIONS THROUGH THE TEMPORAL BONE. 609 means of a short narrow tube, termed the canalis reimietis, with the ductus cochlearis or membranous cochlear tube. The saccule and the utricle are only indirectly brought into communi- cation with each other. A slender tube termed the ductus endolymphaticus occupies the aqueductus vestibuli, and divides into two branches which pass respec- tively into the saccule and the utricle (Fig. 327). The diutus cochleans, or scala media, as we have already noted, lies between the two scalse of the cochlear tube. It ends blindly at each extremity, but close to its basal end it is brought into communication with the saccule by the canalis reuniens.

Sections through the Temporal Bone.— Having now learned something of the parts which form the auditory apparatus, the student is recommended to extend his know- ledge as opportunity arises, by making the following three sections through the macerated bone. (i) A coronal section passing through the internal and external auditory meatuses, nearer to their anterior than to their posterior walls (Fig. 328). (2) A vertical section nearly parallel to the superior border VOL. II.—39

DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 28s The Cervico-facial Division of the facial trunk is smaller than the temporo-facial division. It proceeds forwards, with a slight inclination downwards, and breaks up in the sub- stance of the parotid into three main branches, which are termed from the course which they take— 1. Buccal. 2. Supra-mandibular. 3. Infra-mandibular. In the parotid gland the cervico-facial division crosses the external carotid artery and receives several communicat- ing twigs from the great auricular nerve. The buccal branch runs forwards upon the buccinator muscle to the angle of the mouth, where it ends in filaments for the orbicularis oris, It supplies the buccinator muscle, and forms, with the lo7ig buccal branch of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth nerve, a plexus around the facial vein. The supra-tnandibular branch proceeds forwards upon the lower jaw to reach the muscles in connection with the lower lip. Under cover of the depressor anguli oris it communi- cates with the mental branch of the inferior dental nerve. The infra-mandibular bratich has already been examined in the dissection of the neck (p. 194). Sensory Branches to the Face from the Trigeminal Nerve. —-The branches which come from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve may first be studied. Of these tivo go to the skin of the forehead and scalp—viz., the supra-orbital and the supra-trochlear; tivo, to the eyelids—viz., the palpebral branch of the lachrymal and the infra-trochlear; and one, the nasal, to the skin of the nose. The supra-orbital and the supra-trochlear have already been dissected in the scalp (p. 106). They should now be followed downwards to the point where they turn round the orbital arch of the frontal bone. This can be done by cutting through the frontal belly of the occipito-frontalis and the orbicularis palpebrarum under cover of which they

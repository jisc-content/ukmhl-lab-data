THE BRAIN. 584 To see the furrowed band it will be necessary to remove the tonsil on one side. Lobus Pyramidis.—The pyramid is connected witli the biventral lobule on each side by a faint ridge which crosses the sulcus valleculas. The term lobus pyramidis is given to the three lobules which are thus associated with each other. Lobus Tuberis.—The tuber valvula, which forms the most posterior part of the vermis inferior, is composed of several folia, which run directly into the postero-inferior lobule. The slender lobule is not directly connected with culmen central lobule Fig. 315.—Mesial section through the vermis of the cerebellum. (From Gegenbaur). the tuber valvulse, but it is included with it and the postero- inferior lobule in the lobus tuberis. Dissection.—A mesial section should now be made through the vermis of the cerebellum and the two medullary vela into the cavity of the fourth ventricle. When the two parts of the cerebellum are drawn slightly asunder, a view of the fourth ventricle is obtained ; further, the connections of the two medullary vela and the arrangement of the peduncles of the cerebellum can be more clearly understood. Arbor Vitse Cerebelli.—The cut surface of the cerebellum presents a very characteristic appearance. The grey matter on the surface stands out distinctly from the white matter in

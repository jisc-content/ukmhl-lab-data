396 HEAD AND NECK. two parts—an anterior and a posterior. The posterior part is a rouncjed cord-like ligament which is attached below to the summit of the odontoid process, and above to the fore margin of the foramen magnum. This ligament, inasmuch as it is developed around the continuation of the chorda dorsalis from the odontoid to the basis cranii, is a structure of considerable morphological interest. The anterior part of the suspensory ligament is a fiat and weak band which is attached above to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum at the same point as the posterior portion. Below, the two portions are separated by an interval filled with cellular tissue, and the anterior part is attached to the odontoid process immediately above its articular facet for the anterior arch of the atlas. The Alar or Check Ligaments (ligamenta alaria) (Fig. 251, 9) are very powerful bands which spring, one from each side of the summit of the odontoid process, and proceed outwards and slightly upwards to be attached to the inner aspect of the condyloid eminences of the occipital bone. They limit rotation of the head, and in this they are aided by the accessory atlanto-axial ligaments. Movements.—Nodding movements of the head are permitted at the occipito-atlantal articulations. Rotatory movements of the head and atlas around the odontoid process, which acts as a pivot, take place at the atlanto-axial joints. Excessive rotation is checked by the alar or check ligaments. MOUTH AND PHARYNX. The dissector must now return to the anterior part of the skull which had been laid aside while the dissection of the prevertebral region was going on. The mouth and pharynx should, in the first instance, engage his attention. Mouth.—The mouth is the entrance to or the vestibule of the alimentary canal. It is placed below the nasal chambers, in the lower part of the face, and its cavity is controlled by muscles which are under the influence of the will. The

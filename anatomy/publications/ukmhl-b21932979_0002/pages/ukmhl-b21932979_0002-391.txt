It is placed in tlie back part of the orbit between the optic nerve and the external rectus muscle, and very commonly on the outer side of the ophthalmic artery. By its posterior border it receives its three roots ; whilst from its anterior border the short ciliary nerves are given off. The sensory root comes from the nasal, and is called the long root. It enters the upper and hinder angle of the ganglion. The short or motor root is a short, stout trunk ; it comes from the branch of the oculomotor nerve, which anterior ciliarj' artery sclerotic coat vena vorticosa long posterior ciliary artery pupil. anterior ciliary artery. ciliary muscle. long posterior ciliary artery. vena vorticosa. long posterior ciliary artery.

The sy7npathetic root comes from the cavernous plexus, and joins the posterior border of the ganglion, close to the entrance of the long root from the nasal nerve. In some cases it joins the long root before it reaches the ganglion. The short ciliary nerves are from four to six in number, and they come off in two groups, of which one emerges from the upper and fore angle of the ganglion, whilst the other VOL. II.—24

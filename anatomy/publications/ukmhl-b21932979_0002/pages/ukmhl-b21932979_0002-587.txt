563 INTERNAL CAPSULE. cerebral cortex. Its extent corresponds very nearly with the area occupied by the island of Rail, and its surface towards this portion of the cerebral cortex shows ridges and depressions corresponding to the insular gyri and sulci. Internal Capsule.—This term is applied to the broad band of white matter which intervenes between the len- ticular nucleus on the outside, and the optic thalamus, ttenia semicircularis, and caudate nucleus on the inner side. In front it is much broken up by the connecting bands of grey matter which pass between the head of the caudate nucleus -vM S.71. can. Caudate nucleus. «./. Lenticular nucleus. t.o. Optic tract. pc.

Fig. 306.—Coronal section through the optic thalamus and the corpus striatum opposite the middle commissure. and the fore part of the putamen of the lenticular nucleus (Fig. 304); but behind this it forms a solid white mass of nerve fibres. When seen in horizontal section, the internal capsule is observed to be bent upon itself opposite the taenia semicircularis, or the interval between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus (Fig. 303). This bend, which points inwards, is called the getiu. About one-third of the internal capsule lies in front of the genu, and this part is called the anterior limb ; the remaining two-thirds, which lie behind the genu, constitute the posterior limb.

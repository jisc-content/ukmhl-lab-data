Beyond the outer edge of the latter muscle the tendon expands somewhat, and is inserted into the sclerotic coat midway between the entrance of the optic nerve and the cornea. The pulley through which the tendon passes is a small fibro-cartilaginous ring, which is attached by fibrous tissue to the trochlear fossa—a depression in the frontal bone close to the internal an- gular process. The pul- ley is lined by a small synovial sheath which facilitates the movement of the tendon within it, and from its outer mar- gin it gives a fibrous in- vestment to the tendon. Dissection.—The superior rectus muscle should now be divided midway between its origin and its insertion, and the cut ends thrown back- wards and forwards. On rais- ing the posterior part of the muscle the superior division of the third nerve is brought into view, and will be seen to sink into its deep or ocular surface, and at the same time send a twig to the levator palpebrse superioris. The removal of some fat will bring the optic nerve more fully into view. At the back part of the orbit three structures will be observed crossing the optic nerve —viz. (i) the nasal nerve ; (2) the ophthalmic arterj'; and (3) the superior ophthalmic vein. These should be carefully cleaned and their branches followed out. From the nasal nerve, one or two delicate thread-like branches—the long ciliary 7ten>es—will be found passing forwards along the optic nerve to reach the eyeball. The skort ciliaty nei-ves, much more numerous, accompany the long ciliary branches, and can readily be disengaged from the fat which surrounds the optic nerve. A strong member of this group should be selected and followed backwards; it

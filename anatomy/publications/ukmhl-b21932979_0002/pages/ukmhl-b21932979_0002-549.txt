THE CEREBRUM. 527 hippocampal convolution. Its anterior end is enclosed within the uncus. Dissection.—A dissection should now be made with the view of exposing the upper surface of the corpus callosum—the commissural band which stretches across between the cerebral hemispheres at the bottom of the great longitudinal fissure. With a long knife slice off the top of the right hemisphere at the level of the calloso-marginal fissure. The white medullary centre of the cerebral hemisphere, enclosed on all hands by the grey cortex, is brought very conspicuously into view, and the Fig. 289.—Diagram of a transverse section through the hippocampal convolution and the dentate fissure which lies internal to it.

A transverse incision may next be made through the middle of the callosal convolution, and insinuating the fingers gently under it, the dissector should proceed to tear it away from the hemisphere in an out- ward direction. If this be carried out successfully, the manner in which the fibres of the corpus callosum enter the hemisphere will be seen. In cases where the student is dissecting the brain for the second time, the

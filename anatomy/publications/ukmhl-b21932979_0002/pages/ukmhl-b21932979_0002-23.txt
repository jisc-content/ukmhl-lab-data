MANUAL OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY. THORAX. HE dissection of the thorax is commenced on the eleventh day ^ after the subject has been placed in the dissecting room. By this time the upper limbs have been detached from the trunk. In form the thorax resembles a truncated cone. In front and behind it is flattened; but laterally it is full and rounded. During life the movements of the thoracic walls produce alterations in the capacity of the chest cavity, and play an essential part in the function of respiration. In front, the thoracic cavity is bounded by the sternum and costal cartilages; behind, it is bounded by the twelve dorsal vertebrae and the intervening cartilaginous discs, together with the portions of the ribs which extend out- wards from the vertebral column as far as the angles; laterally, the shafts of the ribs from their angles behind to their anterior extremities in front limit the thoracic cavity. These parts constitute the framework of the thorax, and can be studied on the skeleton. ' Saturdays and Sundays are not counted. VOL. II.â€”1

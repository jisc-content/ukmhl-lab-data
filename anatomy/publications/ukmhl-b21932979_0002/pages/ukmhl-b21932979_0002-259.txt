SIDE OF THE NECK. 237 relations are somewhat different from those on the right side. The same fascial and muscular layers, and the same nerves and veins, lie in front of it. Owing to its different direction, however, the latter are placed more or less parallel to it. Three additional relations are established—viz. (i) the phrenic nerve, which descends in front of it; (2) the left innominate vein, which crosses it; and (3) the thoracic duct, which first passes upwards in relation to its inner side, and then arches over it to reach the angle of junction between the subclavian and internal jugular veins. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, which on this side hooks round the arch of the aorta, lies to the inner side of the subclavian artery. Secotid part.—The second portion of the subclavian artery forms the highest part or summit of the arch. From half-an-inch to an inch above the level of this bone is the average height to which the subclavian artery rises in the neck. In some cases, however, it may reach higher, whilst in others it is placed at a lower level—indeed, it may not extend above the clavicle at all. In this part of its course the vessel is not so deeply placed. In front it is covered by—(i) skin ; (2) superficial fascia and platysma ; (3) deep fascia ; (4) clavicular head of the sterno-mastoid; (5) scalenus anticus. The phrenic nerve on the right side is also an anterior relation. It passes downwards in front of the vessel, but separated from it by the inner margin of the scalenus anticus. Behind and beloiv, the vessel is in contact with the pleura. The sub- clavian vein lies at a lower level and in front of the artery. It is separated from the artery by the scalenus anticus, which intervenes between the two vessels. The third part of the subclavian artery has already been examined (p. 204). Branches of the Subclavian Artery.—Four branches spring from the subclavian trunk. In this respect, however, the vessel is subject to considerable variation. They all

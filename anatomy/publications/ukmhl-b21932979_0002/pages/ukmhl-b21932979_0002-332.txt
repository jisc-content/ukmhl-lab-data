HEAD AND NECK. ternal pterygoid muscles. In this case the vessel makes a bend outwards between the heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and appears on its surface before entering the spheno-maxillary fossa. The branches of the internal maxillary artery are classified into three groups according to the portion of the vessel from which they spring. One branch only of the third part, viz., the posterior dental or the superior posterior alveolar artery, can be studied in this dissection. Those arising from the first and second parts are:â€” From the First Part. From the Second Part. 1. The deep auricular. 2. Tympanic. 3. Middle meningeal. 4. Small meningeal. 5. Inferior dental. 1. Masseteric. 2. Pterygoid. 3. Anterior and posterior deep temporal. 4. Buccal. The deep auricular artery (arteria auricularis profunda) is a small vessel which pierces the anterior wall of the external auditory meatus to supply the skin which lines it and also the superficial part of the tympanic membrane. The meningeal and tympanic branches proceed upwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, and therefore cannot be fully studied until this muscle is reflected. The inferior dental artery (arteria alveolaris inferior) arises opposite the middle meningeal, and runs downwards upon the internal lateral ligament to enter the mandibular foramen of the lower jaw. It is generally accompanied by two vente comites, which lie one upon either side of it, and it is placed behind the inferior dental nerve. Just before enter- ing the canal, the inferior dental artery gives off the slender fjiylo-hyoid branch, which is carried downwards and forwards with the corresponding nerve, upon the deep aspect of the mandible, to the digastric triangle of the neck.

Note, however, that whilst the main attachment of this lamella is to the apices of the transverse processes, it also extends inwards between them and is attached to their contiguous margins. The next step consists in dividing the middle lamella longitudinally close to its vertebral attach- ment. The quadratus lumborum is then brought into view, and gently raising the middle lamella from the surface of this muscle until its outer border is exposed, the whole muscle should be pushed inwards. This brings into view erector spinje. ■ quadratus lumborum. psoas. Fig. 198.—Diagram to show the connections of the lumbar fascia. the third or anterior lamella of the lumbar fascia, and its junction on the one hand with the middle lamella, and on the other with the bodies of the lumbar vertebrje close to the roots of the transverse processes, can be made out. The bimbar fascia, therefore, is formed at the outer borders of the erector spinas and quadratus lumborum muscles by the union of these three lamellae. Superiorly, it is attached to the last rib; inferiorly, it is fixed to the crest of the ilium ; whilst externally it is continued into the

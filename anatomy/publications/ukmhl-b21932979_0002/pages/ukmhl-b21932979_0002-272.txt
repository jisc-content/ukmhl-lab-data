HEAD AND NECK. 250 mediate relation to the vessel, the anterior jugular vein is separated from it by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. The sterno - mastoid artery, a branch of the superior thyroid, crosses the vessel obliquely as it lies within the carotid triangle. The ramus descendens hypoglossi pro- ceeds downwards and inwards upon the vessel, and within its sheath. The ansa hypoglossi is formed upon the anterior aspect of the common carotid artery by the union of the Fig. 219.—Transverse section through the neck, just below the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. The relations of the common carotid at this level to the pharynx, to surrounding nerves, muscles, &c., are well seen. ramus descendens hypoglossi with the ramus descendens cervicalis. Behind, the vessel is in apposition with the longus colli and the scalenus anticus muscles. These intervene between it and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebras. The gangliated cord of the sympathetic, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and the inferior thyroid artery are also related to it posteriorly. The sympathetic cord descends vertically in the substance of the carotid sheath, behind the artery, and is interposed between the vessel and the pre- SINUS PYRIFORHIS DESCENDENS HYPOGLOSSI VAGUS.« LONG.COLLI

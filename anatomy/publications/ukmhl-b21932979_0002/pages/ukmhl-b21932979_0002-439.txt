417 CAROTID CANAL. membrane continuous with that of the pharynx, and it will be noticed that, as the tube is traced towards the pharynx, it gradually increases in calibre. Hence it is frequently described as trumpet-shaped. CAROTID CANAL AND SUPERIOR JVIAXILLARY NERVE. Dissection.—The carotid canal, which traverses the fore part of the petrous bone, may now be opened up by removing its inferior wall with the bone-pliers. In doing this, it is not necessary to interfere with the Eustachian tube, which lies in close proximity. It is well to preserve this structure until we undertake the dissection of the otic ganglion. Carotid Canal.—The carotid canal contains the internal carotid artery and the stout ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The internal carotid artery in this part of its course is about three-fourths of an inch long. At first it ascends vertically; then, bending suddenly, it runs horizontally for- wards and inwards. It emerges from the canal at the apex of the petrous bone. From this point onwards the internal carotid artery has been already examined (p. 358). Whilst within the carotid canal it lies in front of the internal ear. Ascending branch of the cervical sympathetic.—The dissec- tor has already noted a large branch proceeding from the upper end of the superior cervical ganglion and entering the carotid canal with the internal carotid artery. This almost immediately divides into two parts, which place themselves one on either side of the artery, and supply branches to its coats. The further dissection of these branches is a matter of great difficulty, and can only be satisfactorily effected under specially favourable circumstances. The external branch breaks up into the carotid plexus ; the internal branch is continued into the cavernous plexus. From these primary offshoots secondary plexuses are prolonged upon the various branches which spring from the internal carotid artery. VOL. II.—27

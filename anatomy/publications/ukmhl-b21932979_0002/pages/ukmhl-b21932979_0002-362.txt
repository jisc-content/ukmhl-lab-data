HEAD AND NECK. 340 certainly be undertaken by the advanced student in the event of his being able to obtain a part for the purpose. In the following description of these nerves the account of the branches which can in all cases be traced is printed in large type, whilst that of those requiring special dissec- tion is printed in small type. Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve.—The glosso-pharyngeal nerve inclines downwards and forwards and crosses the internal carotid artery superficially. It passes under cover of the styloid process and the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, and at the lower border of the latter it hooks round the muscle and then curves forwards upon its superficial surface to gain the base of the tongue. In the dissection of the submaxillary region, its terminal part has been seen disappearing under cover of the posterior border of the hyo-glossus muscle; here it ends in lingual branches. In the present dissection the following branches should be made out:— 1. Communicating branch from 3. Pharyngeal. the facial. 4. Tonsillitic. 2. Nerve to the stylo-pharyngeus. 5. Lingual. The cotnmu7iicati7ig branch from the facial is a small but important twig. It springs from the nerve to the posterior belly of the digastric, and, as a rule, emerges from midst the fibres of this muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal close to the lower part of the jugular foramen. This branch is considered to convey to the glosso-pharyngeal the motor fibres which it siipplies to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. The stylopharyngeal nerve is a small twig which enters the muscle of the same name. The greater part of its fibres, however, are continued through the muscle to the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The pharyngeal branches consist—(i) of one or two small twigs which perforate the superior constrictor to reach the mucous membrane of the pharynx; and (2) a larger nerve

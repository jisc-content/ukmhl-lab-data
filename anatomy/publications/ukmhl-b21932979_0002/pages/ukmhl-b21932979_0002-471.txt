449 THE LARYNX. connect its margins with the tongue; these are called the lateral glosso-epiglottidean folds. Between the two layers of mucous membrane which constitute each of these three frsenula, there is a small amount of elastic tissue. The depression on each side between the tongue and the epiglottis which is bounded by the median and lateral glosso-epiglottidean folds is termed the vallecula (Fig. 264). The posterior free surface of the epiglottis forms, as we have noted, the greater part of the anterior boundary of the vestibule of the larynx. Owing to the tip of the epiglottis being curled forwards, the upper portion of this surface Fig. 264.—The larynx as seen in the living person by means of the laryngoscope. is convex ; this is followed by a slight concavity, and below this it swells out into a marked convexity, called the cushion or tubercle of the epiglottis. In laryngoscopic examinations the tubercle appears as a conspicuous object. The aryteno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane en- close between their two layers some connective tissue, the aryteno-epiglottidean muscles, and posteriorly the cuneiform cartilages, and the cornicula laryngis which surmount the arytenoid cartilages. When the larynx is examined by the laryngoscope these cartilages are visible on either side in the form of two small rounded elevations or tubercles. vol.. II.—29

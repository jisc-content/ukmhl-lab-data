TEMPORAL AND PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGIONS. 317 they gain the exterior of the cranium, a mixed nerve trunk is the result. This nerve-trunk has under cover of the ex- ternal pterygoid muscle, and after a very short course (not exceeding two or three lines) it ends by dividing into two parts, named respectively the anterior and posterior divisions of the inferior maxillary nerve (Fig. 236). Before it divides, the trunk of the inferior maxillary nerve gives off two branches, viz. (i) the recurrent nerve (nervus spinosus) (//), and (2) the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle (/). The recurrent nerve is a very slender twig which enters the cranium by accompanying the middle meningeal artery through the foramen spinosum. It is distributed to the lining membrane of the mastoid cells and to the great wing of the sphenoid bone. The i?iternalpterygoid nerve will be found passing under cover of the posterior border of the internal pterygoid muscle close to its origin. In close relation to the root of this nerve is the otic ganglion. From the two terminal divisions of the inferior maxillary trunk the chief branches of distribution arise. The small anterior division is much the smaller of the two, and is composed almost entirely of motor fibres derived from the motor root of the trigeminal nerve. The only sensory fibres which it contains are those which form the lo7ig buccal nerve. It gives off the following branches :— 1. Masseteric. 2. Two deep temporal. The large posterior division is chiefly sensory. It contains only a very few fibres from the motor root, and these are prolonged into its inferior dental branch, and afterwards come off in the form of the mylo-hyoid nerve. The branches of the posterior division are :— 1. Auriculo-temporal. 2. Inferior dental (or mandibular). 3. Lingual (or gustatory). 3. External pterygoid. 4. Long buccal.

241 SIDE OF THE NECK. The supra-scapular and transversalis colli veins have al- ready been seen joining the subclavian or the external jugular vein. The Internal Mammary Artery (arteria mammaria interna) springs from the lower aspect of the subclavian opposite the thyroid axis. It proceeds downwards upon the anterior surface of the pleura and behind the inner end of the clavicle, to reach the thoracic cavity. In the cervical part of its course, it will be observed to pass behind the subclavian vein, and to be crossed from without inwards by the phrenic nerve. In the neck, the internal mammary artery is accompanied by no companion vein. Superior Intercostal Artery (truncus costocervicalis).—■ This branch takes origin from the posterior aspect of the second portion of the subclavian artery, close to the inner border of the scalenus anticus. On the left side, however, it, as a rule, proceeds from the first part of the parent trunk. To bring it into view, the subclavian artery must be dislodged from its position. It is a short trunk which passes back- wards and slightly upwards, and almost immediately divides into the deep cervical artery and the superior intercostal artery proper. The deep cervical artery (arteria cervicalis profunda) passes backwards, and disappears from view between the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. It has been already noticed in the dissection of the back of the neck (p. 154). The superior intercostal artery (arteria intercostalis suprema) turns downwards over the neck of the first rib, close to the outer side of the sympathetic cord, and ends in the thorax by giving branches to the upper two intercostal spaces. The deep cervical vein is a large vessel. It joins the vertebral vein. The Subclavian Vein (vena subclavia) is the continuation of the axillary vein into the root of the neck. It begins, vofi. 11.—16

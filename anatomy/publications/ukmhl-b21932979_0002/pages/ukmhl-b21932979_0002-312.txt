HEAD AND NECK. The inferior labial arises immediately above the base of the lower jaw, and is carried forwards under cover of the depressor anguli oris to supply the parts in connection with the chin and lower lip. It anastomoses with the mental, the terminal branch of the submental and the inferior coronary arteries. It is also connected with the corre- sponding arteries of the opposite side. The inferior coronary takes origin opposite the angle of the mouth, and runs inwards in the lower lip near its free margin between the mucous membrane and the orbicularis oris. In a well injected subject it will be seen shining through the mucous membrane when the lip is everted. It anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side and with the inferior labial. The superior coronary arises under cover of the zygo- maticus major, and is related to the upper lip in the same manner that the inferior coronary is related to the lower lip. It is generally of larger size. It gives off a branch called the septal artery, which runs along the lower border of the nasal septum and distributes twigs as far as the tip of the nose. The lateral nasal artery is a branch which is given to the side of the nose, and as a rule passes forwards under cover of the levator labii superioris alteque nasi. The angular artery is the name that is applied to the terminal part of the facial artery. It anastomoses with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery. Facial Vein (vena facialis anterior).â€”The facial vein begins at the inner canthus of the eye, in a well marked venous trunk called the angular vein, which is formed by tributaries coming from the forehead, the upper eyelid and the root of the nose (p. no). The course which the facial vein takes is not nearly so tortuous as that of the corre- sponding artery; it lies behind the artery and is separated from it by a considerable interval. Below the malar bone it proceeds in a nearly vertical direction along the anterior

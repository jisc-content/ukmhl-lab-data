539 THE CEREBRUM. the posterior pillar of the fornix and the uncus have been pointed out (p. 526). Inferior Fissure of the Cerebrum.—When the pia mater in the region of the hippocampal fissure is removed from th^ surface of the brain, the choroid plexus in the interior of the descending horn of the lateral ventricle is usually withdrawn with it, and a fissure appears between the fimbria and the roof of the ventricular horn. This is termed the inferior fissure of the cerebrum or the lower part of the great transverse fissure. By the withdrawal of the choroid plexus, it is converted into a gap which leads directly from the exterior of the brain into the interior of the descending horn of the lateral ventricle (Fig. 289). The Choroid Plexus is a convoluted system of blood vessels in connection with a fold of pia mater which is prolonged into the descending horn of the lateral ventricle through the inferior fissure of the cerebrum. It hes on the surface of the hippocampus major, and is continuous behind the posterior border of the optic thalamus with the choroid plexus in the body of the lateral ventricle. But it must not be supposed that the choroid plexus lies free in the ventricular cavity. It is clothed in the most intimate manner by an epithelial layer, which represents the inner or mesial wall of the descending horn pushed into the cavity by the choroid plexus. The ventricle, therefore, only opens on the surface through the inferior cerebral fissure when this thin epithelial layer is torn away by the withdrawal of the choroid plexus. The Trigonum Ventriculi (Fig. 295, tr.v) is a smooth triangular surface on the floor of the ventricle at the junc- tion of the posterior and descending horns. The hippo- campus minor and the hippocampus major as they diverge from ^each other—the former curving backwards into the posterior horn and the latter curving forwards into the descending horn—bound the trigonum ventriculi in front and behind.

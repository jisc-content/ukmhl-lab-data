The inferior ophthalmic vein lies deeper, below the level of the optic nerve, and it is brought into communication with the pterygoid venous plexus by an offset which passes through the spheno-maxillary fissure. The two ophthalmic veins receive numerous tributaries during their course through the orbit, and finally they pass between the two heads of the external rectus muscle, and through the sphenoidal fissure to open into the cavernous sinus, either separately or by a common trunk. The Eecti Muscles.—The four straight muscles of the eyeball converge to the apex of the orbit, and together form LEV. PALP. SUP. INF. REOT.

The rechis superior., which has been reflected, has' already been studied. The rectus internus springs from the inner side of the optic foramen, and the rectus inferior takes origin from a fibrous band which bounds the inner extremity of the sphenoidal fissure (Fig. 245). The rectus externus is distinguished from the others by arising from a

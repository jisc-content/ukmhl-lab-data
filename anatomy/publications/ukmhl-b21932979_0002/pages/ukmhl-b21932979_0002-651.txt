627 ZONULA OF ZINN. arteria retinje centralis, which in the foetus extends forwards for the supply of the capsule of the lens, but afterwards disappears. The canal of Stilling, as a rule, cannot be seen in an ordinary dis- section of the eyeball; but if the eye-kernel be shaken up in the picro- carmine solution as recommended by Anderson Stuart, it may some- times be rendered evident through the staining fluid entering it.

As this approaches the margin of the crystalline lens, it splits into two parts, viz., an exceedingly delicate deep lamina, which lines the fossa patellaris (Anderson Stuart), and a more superficial stronger part, which becomes attached to the cap- sule of the crystalline lens. The zonula of Zinn lies subjacent to the ciliary processes, and is radially plaited or wrinkled in correspondence with these. Thus the elevations or wrinkles of the zonule extend

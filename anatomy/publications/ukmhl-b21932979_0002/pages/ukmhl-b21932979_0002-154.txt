132 HEAD AND NECK. sinus at this stage, on account of the various nerves which pass forwards in its walls to the orbit, and which are best studied with the parts in that cavity. He should simply note, therefore, at present, that this sinus lies upon the side of the body of the sphenoid bone. The Circular Sinus (sinus circularis)—Fig. i94(5/a)—how- ever, which surrounds the pituitary body, may be examined. It consists of two transverse channels (the anterior and the posterior intercavernous sinuses) which connect the cavernous sinuses, and lie one in front, and the other behind the in- fundibulum of the pituitary body. The Petrosal Sinuses—Fig. 194 {Sps and vS^/)—drain the blood from the posterior end of the cavernous sinus. They are two in number on each side—viz., superior and inferior. The superior petrosal shitis (sinus petrosus superior) runs along the superior border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and joins the lateral sinus. The inferior petrosal sinus (sinus petrosus inferior) is the larger of the two, but has a shorter course. It passes backwards and outwards in the groove between the basilar process of the occipital bone and the inferior margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It leaves the cranial cavity by passing through the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen, and ends by joining the commencement of the internal jugular vein. The Basilar Sinus (plexus basilaris)—Fig. 194 {Fb)—is not a single channel, but a plexus of minute sinuses which permeate the dura mater over the basilar process of the occipital bone. It connects the two inferior petrosal sinuses, and posteriorly communicates with the anterior intraspinal veins. The Spheno-Parietal Sinus (sinus ate parvje)—Fig. 194 {Ssp)—is a minute blood channel which runs inwards under shelter of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. Externally it commences in one of the small meningeal veins, whilst internally it pours its blood into the fore part of the cavernous

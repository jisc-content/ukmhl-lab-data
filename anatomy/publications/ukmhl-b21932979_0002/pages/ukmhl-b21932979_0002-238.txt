Carotid Triangle.—During the dissection of the carotid triangle the following parts are displayed :— 1. Common carotid dividing into external and internal carotid arteries. 2. Superior thyroid. ^ 3. Lingual. 4. Facial. Arteries-^ 5. Occipital. 6. Ascending pharyngeal. 7. Hyoid. 8. Sterno-mastoid. 9. Superior laryngeal. ^10. Sterno-mastoid branch of the occipital. Branches of the external carotid. Branches of the superior thyroid. Veins 1 2. 3- Tributaries of the internal jugular. Crossing the space obliquely. Internal jugular. Facial.

Greater comu of the hyoid bone. Lymphatic vessels and glands. This subdivision of the anterior triangle, when opened up, contains portions of each of the three carotid arteries. It therefore receives the name of carotid in'ang/e. It is well, however, that the dissector should clearly understand that it is only after the parts are relaxed by dissection that these vessels come to lie within the space. When the fascia and

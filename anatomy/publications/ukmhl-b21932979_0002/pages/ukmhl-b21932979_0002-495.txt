473 THE TONGUE. encircled by an annular elevation, which is termed the vallum. The fungiform papilhe are much smaller, but are present in much greater numbers. They are chiefly found on the tip and sides of the tongue, but they are also scattered at irregular intervals over the dorsum. They are very characteristic in form. Each papilla pre- sents a large, full, rounded knob-like extremity, while it is greatly constricted at the point where it springs from the mucous surface. In the living tongue the fungiform papillae are distinguished by their bright red colour. The conical papillcB are present in very large numbers. They are smaller than the fungiform variety, and although they are quite visible to the naked eye, they can be more conveniently studied by the aid of an ordinary pocket lens. They are minute conical projections from the mucous mem- brane which taper towards their free extremities, and occupy the dorsum and sides of the tongue in front of the foramen caecum. They are arranged in parallel rows which are placed close together, and in the back part of the tongue these diverge from the mesial raphe in a forward and out- ward direction. Towards the tip of the tongue the rows of conical papillae become more or less transverse in direction, and on the sides of the tongue they are arranged per- pendicularly. Muscles of the Tongue.—The tongue is almost entirely composed of muscular fibres, with some adipose tissue intermixed. It is divided into two lateral halves by a mesial septum, and the muscles in connection with each of these consist of an intrinsic and an extrinsic group. They are as follows:— 1. Genio-hyo-glossus. 2. riyo-glossus. 3. Chondro-glossus. 4. Stylo-glossus. ^ 5. I'alato-glossus. Extrinsic Muscles,

By looking through the posterior nares the dissector obtains a partial view of the two lower meatuses of the nose, and of the posterior extremities of the middle and inferior turbi- nated bones. The orifices of the Eustachiatt tubes are placed one on each lateral wall of the naso-pharynx, behind the lower part Fig. 256.—Antero-posterior section through the nose, moutli, and pharynx, a Uttle to the left of the mesial plane. of the posterior nares.

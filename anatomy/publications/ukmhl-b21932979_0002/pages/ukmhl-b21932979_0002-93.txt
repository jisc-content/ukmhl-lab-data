THORACIC CAVITY. 71 of the left pneumogastric has been previously traced over the aortic arch into the superficial cardiac plexus. The corresponding branch on the right side proceeds downwards in relation to the innominate artery, and joins the right portion of the deep cardiac plexus. Thoracic cardiac bra?ickes are only given off from the trunk of the right pneumogastric. They join the right portion of the deep plexus. The recurrent laryngeal branches of the pneumogastric nerves also supply cardiac twigs to the deep plexus. On the left side, where the recurrent laryngeal hooks round the arch of the aorta, these branches are more numerous, and replace the thoracic cardiac branches of the left pneumogastric. The following'^table shows the arrangement of the cardiac nerves with reference to the plexus :— I. Superior cardiac branch of sym- Superficial cardiac plexus, . . j { I Left portion of the deep cardiac plexus, .... Right portion of the deep cardiac plexus, V pathetic of left side. Lowest cervical cardiac branch of left pneumogastric. Middle and lower cardiac branches of the sympathetic of left side. 2. Upper two cervical cardiac branches of the pneumogastric. 3. Cardiac branches of the left recurrent laryngeal. 1. Three cardiac branches of sym- pathetic of right side. 2. Cervical cardiac branches of the pneumogastric. 3. Thoracic cardiac branches of the pneumogastric. 4. Cardiac branches of the right recurrent laryngeal. The manner in which the different offsets from the cardiac plexus are distributed has, to a certain extent, been examined. From the right portion of the deep plexus proceed—(i) an offset to join the right anterior pulmonary plexus; (2) an

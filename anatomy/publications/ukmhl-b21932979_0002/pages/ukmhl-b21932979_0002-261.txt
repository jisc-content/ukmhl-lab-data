239 SIDE OF THE NECK. the posterior aspect of the commencement of the correspond- ing innominate vein. Near its termination it crosses the subclavian artery. It receives the deep cervical and the anterior vertebral veins. Thyroid Axis (truncus thyreocervicalis).—This is a short wide trunli, which arises from the front of the subclavian artery, close to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus, and under cover of the internal jugular vein. It lies be- tween the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves, and almost immediately breaks up into its three terminal branches—• viz., the inferior thyroid, the suprascapular, and the trans- versalis colli. The Inferior Thyroid Artery (arteria thyreoidea inferior) takes a sinuous course to reach the thyroid body. At first, it ascends for a short distance upon the vertebral artery, and under cover of the internal jugular vein; then it turns suddenly downwards and inwards, and passes behind the sympathetic and the common carotid artery; lastly, it bends upwards, and ends in branches at the base of the lateral lobe of the thyroid body. The following branches will be noticed arising from the inferior thyroid artery :— 1. Ascending cervical. 4. Oesophageal. 2. Inferior laryngeal. 5. Thyroid. 3. Tracheal. 6. Muscular. The ascending cervical artery (arteria cervicalis ascendens) is a small but very constant vessel, which runs upwards in the interval between the scalenus anticus and rectus capitis anticus major, and dispenses branches to the muscles in front of the vertebral column. Other twigs from the as- cending cervical, termed spinal branches, enter the spinal canal upon the spinal nerves, and anastomose with branches from the vertebral artery. The ultimate distribution of the spinal branches has already been noticed (pp. 166 and 179). The inferior laryngeal artery (arteria laryngea inferior) is a small vessel which accompanies the recurrent laryngeal

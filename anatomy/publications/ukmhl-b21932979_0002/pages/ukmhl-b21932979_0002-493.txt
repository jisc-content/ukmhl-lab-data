THE TONGUE. 471 THE TONGUE. The tongue is a muscular organ placed on the floor of the mouth. It has important duties to perform in connec- tion with the functions of mastication, deglutition, and articulation. Moreover, the mucous membrane which covers it is specially modified in certain localities in con- nection with the peripheral terminations of the nerves of taste. The root, or broad posterior extremity of the tongue, is attached to the hyoid bone; in front, the pointed ex- tremity is free. The dorsal aspect of its base forms the lower boundary of the isthmus faucium, and is surmounted on each side by the tonsil. Mucous Membrane.â€”The lingual mucous membrane is a part of the general mucous lining of the buccal cavity, and it envelops the dorsum, sides, tip, and under surface of the tongue. It presents different appearances in different localities. Thus over the posterior part of the dorsum, in the region which is bounded behind by the epiglottis, and on either side by the tonsil, the mucous membrane is smooth, and presents no papillse which are visible to the unaided eye. It is from this district that the three glosso- epiglottidean folds take origin, and every here and there the surface is studded with low projections which are produced by lymphoid follicles, placed subjacent to the mucous membrane. About an inch or so in front of the epiglottis, a median depression, termed the foramen cacum, may be noticed, and in front of this the mucous membrane which covers the dorsum, sides, and tip of the tongue is beset with papillae of different kinds. As these are individually visible to the naked eye, the mucous membrane presents a very characteristic appearance. Further a mesial groove or sulcus called the raphe, extends backwards from the tip of the tongue to the foramen cfecum, and divides the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum into two lateral parts.

THORACIC CAVITY. 55 ductus arteriosus. —pulmonary artery. between the infundibular and septal flaps pass a number of short chordae tendineae, some of which spring directly from the septum, whilst others proceed from low, feeble, musculi papillares, also connected with the upper part of the septum. Pulmonary Artery (arteria pulmonalis).—This vessel is a short wide trunk about two inches long. It has an oblique direction upwards and backwards, so as to reach the lower aspect of the aortic arch. It here divides into a right and a left branch. At first, it lies in front of the root of the aorta, but, before it terminates, it is placed upon the left side of the ascending aorta (Fig. i66, p. 41). In relation to each side of the pulmonary artery the dissector will notice the corresponding coronary artery and auri- cular appendix. It is almost completely en- closed within the fibrous pericardium, the serous layer of which forms a single tubular sheath around it and the as- cending aorta. The right pulmon- ary artery is somewhat longer and larger than the left. It passes transversely out- wards behind the ascending aorta and superior vena cava to reach the root of the right lung, where it has already been dissected (Fig. 177, p. 67). The left pulmonary artery runs outwards in front of the descending aorta and left bronchus to gain the root of the left lung (Fig. 177, p. 67). The blood is thus conducted from the right ventricle of the heart to the two lungs. Obliterated Ductus Arteriosus.—A strong fibrous cord— the ligamentum artcriosum—will be observed connecting the upper surface of the root of the left pulmonary artery Fig. 173.—Heart of a seven months' fcetus.

96 THORAX. crus of the diaphragm, and is continued upwards upon the vertebral column as far as the ninth dorsal vertebra. At this point it turns to the right, and crossing behind the aorta and thoracic duct, it joins the vena azygos major inde- pendently of the vena azygos minor superior. The tributaries of this vein are the intercostal veins of the three lower spaces of the left side. The veins of the thoracic parietes are extremely variable, and the above description of them must be looked upon as merely representing their more usual arrangement. THORACIC JOINTS. The student should now complete the dissection of the thorax by an examination of the various thoracic joints. Dissectioti.—The portion of the sternum with the cartilages of the ribs which was laid aside, together with the other joints in connection with the anterior wall of the thorax, should now be dissected. Inter- sternal, costo-sternal, and inter-chondral articulations require examina- tion. Very little dissection is necessary. After the ligaments have been defined, the dissector should remove a thin slice from the anterior aspect of each articulation, in order that the interior of the joint may be displayed. The Manubrio-gladiolar Articulation between the manu- brium and the gladiolus of the sternum partakes of the nature of an amphiarthrosis. The opposing surfaces of bone are covered by a layer of hyaline cartilage, and united by intermediate fibro-cartilage in which a synovial cavity sometimes appears. The joint is supported by some anterior and posterior longitudinal fibres which are developed in connection with the strong and thick periosteum. The posterior ligament is the stronger of the two. Sterno-costal Articulations.—Seven ribs articulate, by means of their cartilages, directly with each side of the sternum. The articulations of the first and the sixth are

52 THORAX. of the right ventricle is rendered extremely irregular by the projection of fleshy ridges called columnce. carnecs (trabeculse carnese). It is customary to describe these as presenting three different forms—{a) simple elongated ridges ; {b) fleshy slips or trabeculse free throughout the greater part of their extent, but fixed to the wall by their two extremities; {c) conical fleshy projections of considerable size, which project into the cavity, and are attached by their bases only. These last are called musculi papil- lares, and are arranged so as to form an anterior and a posterior set. The free end of each of these papillary muscles gives origin to several delicate thread-like ten- dons—the chorda teti- dinece — and by these they are brought into connection with the seg- ments of the auriculo- ventricular valve. A transverse fleshy band will be noticed to spring from the base of the an- terior papillary muscle, and stretch across the ventricular cavity to the septum, to which it is attached. This is the moderator band. By fixing the yielding anterior wall of the ventricle to the more solid septum, it is said to prevent over distension of the cavity. There are two openings in the right ventricle—(i) the auriculo-ventricular, which gives admission to the stream of blood; (2) the pulmonary^ through which the blood passes Fig. 171.—Transverse section through the ventricular part of the heart.

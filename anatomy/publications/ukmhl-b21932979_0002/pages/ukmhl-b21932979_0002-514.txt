492 THE BRAIN. The posterior internalfrontal artery (prrecuneal) ramifies on the inner surface of the prsecuneus, and its terminal twigs turn round the upper margin of the cerebral hemisphere to gain its outer surface. The Middle Cerebral Artery (arteria cerebri media) passes outwards and upwards in the Sylvian fissure, and soon breaks up into a number of large terminal branches, which spread out on the surface of the island of Reil. Before the posterior limb of the Sylvian fissure is opened up so as to expose the island of Reil, these branches are observed streaming out from between its two lips (Fig. 280). They then diverge so as to supply a wide area of cortex on the outer surface of the cerebral hemisphere. The branches which spring from the middle cerebral artery may be classified thus :— Central or basal ) branches. / Antero-lateral. Cortical branches ! External orbital. Frontal \ External inferior frontal. I Ascending frontal. Parietal. ■{ Ascending parietal. Parieto-temporal. ^ Temporal. The antero-lateral group Qi basal arteries are very numerous. They pierce the outer part of the anterior perforated spot and supply the lenticular nucleus, the internal and the external capsule, the caudate nucleus and a portion of the optic thalamus. The frontal and parietal branches turn round the upper lip of the posterior limb of the Sylvian fissure and ascend on the outer surface of cerebrum. The frontal b7-anches are : (i) an external orbital to the outer part of the orbital surface of the frontal lobe ; (2) an inferior external frontal to the inferior frontal convolution ; (3) an ascending frontal which runs upwards in relation to the ascending frontal convolu- tion. The ascending parietal branch extends in an upward and backward direction in relation to the ascending parietal convolution, and its terminal twigs supply the greater part of the cortex of the superior parietal convolution. The parieto-temporal branch is a very large artery which issues from

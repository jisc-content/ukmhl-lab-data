487 MEMBRANES AND BLOOD VESSELS. most part, proceed outwards from either side of the vessel. They are:— 3. Anterior inferior cerebellar. The transverse arteries (rami ad pontem) are numerous slender twigs which run outwards on the surface of the pons and enter its substance. The auditory artery (arteria audi- tiva interna) will be seen amongst these. It follows the auditory nerve into the internal auditory meatus, and is distributed to the internal ear. The anterior inferior cerebellar (arteria cerebelli inferior anterior) inclines outwards and backwards to reach the anterior part of the inferior surface of the cerebellum. The superior cerebellar artery (arteria cerebelli superior) is a large vessel which springs from the basilar close to its termination. It winds outwards and backwards along the upper border of the pons Varolii to reach the upper surface of the cerebellum, upon which it spreads out in a number of large branches which, for the most part, take a backward course. The Posterior Cerebral Artery (arteria cerebri posterior). —Immediately beyond the origin of the two superior cere- bellar arteries, the basilar trunk bifurcates into the two posterior cerebral arteries. These diverge from each other, and, curving outwards, they encircle the mesencephalon, and are carried backwards towards the under surface of the splenium of the corpus callosum. In this course the pos- terior cerebral artery lies deeply in the interval between the corresponding crus cerebri and the hippocampal gyrus, and, finally passing on to the tentorial surface of the cerebral hemi- sphere, it disappears from view by sinking into the anterior extremity of the calcarine fissure. In this fissure the artery ends by dividing into two terminal branches, viz., the cal- carine and the parieto-occipital (Figs. 278 and 279). The third or oculomotor nerve passes forwards in the 1. Transverse. 2. Internal auditory. 4. Superior cerebellar. 5. Posterior cerebral.

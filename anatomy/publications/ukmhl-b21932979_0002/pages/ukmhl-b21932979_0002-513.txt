MEMBRANES AND BLOOD VESSELS. 491 corpus callosum), which may be traced as far as the splenium or posterior end of the corpus callosum. Numerous branches proceed from the anterior cerebral artery :— Basal or central \ Antero-mesial. i' Inferior internal frontal (or internal orbital). Anterior internal frontal. Middle internal frontal (or paracentral). Posterior internal frontal (or prsecuneal). The antero-mesial group of arteries pierce the inner part of the locus perforatus anticus, and supply the enlarged anterior end of the caudate nucleus. The inferior internalfrontal brafiches (internal orbital) are two or three in number, and turn round the inner margin of the great longitudinal Fig. 280.—The arteries distributed on the outer surface of the cerebral hemisphere. fissure to reach the inner part of the orbital surface of the frontal lobe. They supply the gyrus rectus, the olfactory peduncle and bulb, and the internal orbital convolution (Figs. 278 and 279). The anterior internal frontal artery ramifies upon the fore-part of the inner surface of the frontal lobe, and its terminal twigs turn round the upper margin of the cerebral hemisphere, and supply the outer surface of the frontal lobe as far down as the sulcus frontalis medius (Fig. 279). The middle internal frontal artery (paracentral) ramifies on the inner surface of the frontal lobe behind the preceding branch. Its terminal part passes over the paracentral convolution, and reaches the adjacent portion of the outer surface of the cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 279).

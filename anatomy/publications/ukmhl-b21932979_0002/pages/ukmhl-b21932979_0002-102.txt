8o THORAX. the diaphragm. It is distributed within the abdomen upon the anterior surface of the stomach. The right pneumogastric nerve, in the upper part of the superior mediastinum, Hes deeper in the thorax than the left nerve. It enters by passing between the subclavian artery and the right innominate vein, and descends by the side of the trachea (Figs. 178 and 176) to the posterior aspect of the root of the right lung (Figs. 177 and 182). Here it breaks up into the right posterior pulmonary plexus, and, issuing from this in the form of two nervous cords, it takes part in the formation of the plexus gulce. It leaves this plexus upon the posterior aspect of the oesophagus, and, entering the abdomen through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, it is distributed to the stomach upon its posterior surface. The pneumogastric nerves give off the following branches within the thorax :— 1. Recurrent laryngeal (left side). 2. Thoracic cardiac. 3. Pulmonary. 4. CEsophageal. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve springs from the pneumo- gastric as it crosses the arch of the aorta. It hooks round the aortic arch, or rather the attachment of the ligamentum arteriosum to the under surface of the arch, and reaching the trachea, ascends by the side of this to the larynx. The right recttrrent laryngeal nerve arises in the root of the neck, and hooks round the subclavian artery. The thoracic cardiac braiiches of the right side proceed in part from the pneumogastric and in part from the recurrent laryngeal nerve of that side. On the left side of the body they are derived from the left recurrent laryngeal nerve as it turns round the aortic arch. The pulmonary branches have already been studied in connection with the root of the lung {vide p. 28). The (esophageal branches are dispensed to the gullet in two sets—(i) a few delicate twigs are given by the pneumo-

27 THORACIC CAVITY. end of the upper lobe, a third or intermediate lobe. This second cleft begins at the posterior border of the lung in the oblique fissure, and proceeds horizontally forwards on the outer surface to the anterior border. The middle or intermediate lobe of the right lung is triangular or wedge- shaped in outline. Root of the Lung.—This is the term which is applied to a number of structures which enter the lung at the hilum or slit upon its inner concave surface. These structures are held together by an investment of pleura, and constitute a pedicle which retains the lung in its place when the thoracic cavity is opened. The pleura should be carefully stripped from around the root of the lung; but, before undertaking the dissection of the structures which compose the root, the relation which it bears to neighbouring parts should be determined. hi front there are—(i) K delicate plexus of nerves, the anterior pulmonary plexus; and (2) the phrenic nerve with the arteria comes nervi phrenici. Behind, the pneumo- gastric nerve breaks up into the posterior pulmonary plexus ; whilst, inferiorly, there is the ligamentum latum pulmonis. These are the relations which are common to the root of the lung upon both sides of the body, but there are others which are peculiar to each side. On the right side—(i) The vena azygos major, as it passes forwards to join the superior vena cava, is in relation to the upper border of the pulmonary root; (2) the superior vena cava, in the lower part of its course, lies in front of the pulmonary root. On the left side, the aorta arches over the root of the lung, and the descending thoracic aorta passes down behind it. Dissection.—Now proceed to dissect out the constituent parts of the root of the lung. Constituent parts of the Pulmonary Root.—The most important structures which enter into the formation of the pulmonary root are—(i) the two pulmonary veins; (2) the

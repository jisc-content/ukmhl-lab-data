The hammer and chisel are now brought into requisition, and by these the inner table can readily be split along the line in which the outer table of the cranium is divided. By insinuating the hook at the end of the cross-bar of the chisel into the fissure in front, the skull-cap can be forcibly wrenched off. Dura Mater.—The brain is clothed by three distinct membranes, which are termed the vtetiinges. These are so. Fig. 187.—Diagrammatic section through the meninges of the brain. (Schwalbe.) d.

560 THE BRAIN. the optic thalamus by the taenia semicircularis. Finally, its tail turns downwards and then forwards into the descending horn of the lateral ventricle, on the roof of which it is pro- longed until it finally joins the amygdaloid nucleus. The caudate nucleus, therefore, presents a free ventricular surface covered with ependyma, and a deep surface embedded in the substance of the cerebrum, and for the most part related to the internal capsule. Owing to its arched form, it follows that in horizontal sections below a particular level it is cut at two points, and both the head and the tail must be looked for in the field of section (Fig. 303). The Lenticular Nucleus lies on the outer side of the caudate nucleus and the optic thalamus, and is for the most part completely embedded within the white medullary sub- stance of the cerebral hemisphere. It does not occupy so much ground as the nucleus caudatus. Indeed, it pre- sents a very close correspondence in point of extent with the island of Reil on the surface. When seen in horizontal section (Fig. 303) it presents a shape similar to that of a biconvex lens. Its inner surface bulges more than the outer surface, and its point of highest convexity is placed opposite the taenia semicircularis or the interval between the caudate nucleus and the anterior end of the optic thalamus. When seen in coronal section, the appearance presented by the lenticular nucleus differs very much in the different planes of section. Figure 304 represents a section through its anterior portion. Here it is semilunar or crescentic in outline. Further, it is intimately connected with the head of the caudate nucleus by bands of grey matter which pass between the two nuclei and break up the fore part of the internal capsule. It is due to the ribbed or barred appearance which is presented by such a section as this that the term corpus striatum is given to the two nuclei. When the section is made in a plane further back, the

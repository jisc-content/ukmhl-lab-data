40 THORAX. heart enclosed within the pericardium and the anterior wall of the thorax. A small portion of the pericardium in the lower part of the anterior mediastinum is in direct relation to the triangularis sterni muscle as it covers the deep surface of the sternum, and the inner extremities of the fifth and sixth costal cartilages of the left side. A wider area at the same level, owing to the incisura cardiaca in the anterior margin of the left lung, is uncovered by the lung. This Fig. 165.â€”Diagram to show the position of the heart in relation to the anterior chest wall. (From Braune.) area may be mapped out on the chest wall by drawing a vertical line along the middle line of the sternum, from the level of the inner extremities of the fourth costal cartilages to the lower end of the gladiolus, and by carrying two other lines, from the extremities of the first line, outwards so as to meet at a point over the apex beat of the heart. On either side, the heart and pericardium is supported by the media- stinal pleura and the inner surface of the lung.

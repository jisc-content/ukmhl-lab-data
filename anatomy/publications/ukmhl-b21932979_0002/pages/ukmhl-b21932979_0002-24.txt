THORAX. 2 The anterior wall of the thorax is shorter than the posterior wall. Thus, during expiration, the upper margin of the manubrium sterni is placed opposite the disc be- tween the second and third dorsal vertebrae, whilst the lower end of the body of the sternum corresponds in level with the middle point of the body of the ninth dorsal vertebra. The bodies of the dorsal vertebrae project for- wards into the cavity of the thorax, and greatly diminish its antero-posterior diameter in the mesial plane; but on either side of the vertebral column, owing to the backward sweep of the posterior portions of the ribs, a deep hollow is formed for the reception of the most massive part of the lung. The superior aperture, or i7ilet of the thorax, is a narrow opening which is bounded by the first dorsal vertebra, the first pair of costal arches, and the manubrium sterni. The plane of this opening is very oblique; it slopes from be- hind forwards and downwards. Through the inlet of the thorax enter the windpipe, gullet, the pneumogastric nerves, the gangliated cords of the sympathetic, and the great veins which carry blood towards the heart from the head and neck and the superior extremities; whilst through the same opening egress is given to the thoracic duct and to the arteries which convey blood to the neck, head, and upper limbs. The base or dependent part of the thorax is very wide, and is sometimes called the outlet. In front it is bounded by the ensiform cartilage, and behind by the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Between these points the lower margin of the thorax presents a curved outline. Starting from the ster- num, it proceeds downwards, outwards, and backwards along the cartilages of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs. At the tip of the eleventh rib the direction of the lower margin of the thorax changes, and it proceeds upwards, backwards, and inwards along the twelfth rib to the vertebral column. Attached to the lower margin of the thorax is the dia-

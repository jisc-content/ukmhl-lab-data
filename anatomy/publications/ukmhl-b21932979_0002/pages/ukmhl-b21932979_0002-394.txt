HEAD AND NECK. 372 arterial circle under the conjunctiva. Finally, they pierce the sclerotic immediately behind the cornea. The supra-orbital artery (arteria supraorbitalis) accom- panies the supra-orbital nerve, and thus gains the forehead, where it has been dissected at a previous stage (p. no). The ethmoidal arteries are two in number—anterior and posterior—and they run to the anterior and posterior in- ternal orbital foramina on the inner wall of the orbit. The posterior ethmoidal artery (arteria ethmoidalis posterior) sup- phes the mucous lining of the posterior ethmoidal cells, and sends twigs to the upper part of the nose. The anterior ethjHoidal artery (arteria ethmoidalis anterior) is a larger branch. It runs in company with the nasal nerve proper, and gives off minute twigs at each stage of its course. Thus in the anterior internal orbital canal it gives branches to the mucous lining of the anterior ethmoidal cells and the frontal sinus; during its short sojourn in the cranial cavity it supplies the small anterior inenifigeal artery (arteria meningea anterior) (p. 134)5 in the nasal cavity it gives twigs to the mucous membrane; whilst its terminal branch appears on the face to supply parts on the side of the nose. The ititernal palpebral branches (arteria palpebrales mediales) come off near the orbital opening, and are two. in number—one for the upper and the other for the lower eyehd (p. 298). The nasal branch (arteria dorsalis nasi) is distributed at the root of the nose, and anastomoses with the angular branch of the facial artery. The frontal artery (arteria frontalis) accompanies the supra-trochlear nerve to the forehead, where it has already been dissected (p. no). The Ophthalmic Veins.—As a general rule these are two in number—superior and inferior. The superior ophthalmic vein is the larger of the two, and it accompanies the artery across the optic nerve. It takes origin at the root of the nose, where it communicates by a wide radicle with the

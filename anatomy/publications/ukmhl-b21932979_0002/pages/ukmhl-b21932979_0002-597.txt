Superficial Arcuate Fibres.—On the surface of the medulla, more particularly in the neighbourhood of the lower border of the olive, a number of curved bundles of fibres, termed the stiperficial arcuate fibres, may be noticed. They vary very greatly in number and in dis- F.c. F.C. F.C. F.C. Fig. 311.—Diagram of the connections of the gracile and cuneate nuclei. (From Bruce.) F.C. N.C. F.G. N.G. Funiculus cuneatus.

An attentive examination will show that they come to the surface in the antero-median groove between the pyramids, and frequently in the groove between the pyramid and the olive. But at whatever point they reach the surface, they all have one

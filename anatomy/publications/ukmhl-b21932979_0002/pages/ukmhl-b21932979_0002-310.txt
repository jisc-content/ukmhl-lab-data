HEAD AND NECK. 288 From the inferior maxillary division of the trigeminal three nerves are furnished to the face, viz., the auriculo- temporal, which has been described in p. io8; the long buccal nerve ; and the mental nerve. The long buccal nerve (n. buccinatorius) will be found coming out from under cover of the anterior border of the masseter muscle. Its branches communicate freely with the facial nerve around the facial vein, and supply the skin and the mucous membrane of the cheek. The latter pierce the buccinator muscle. The mental nerve is a large branch of the mandibular nerve which appears through the mental foramen of the lower jaw under cover of the depressor anguli oris. It communicates with the facial, and supplies the mucous membrane of the lower lip, and the integument of the chin and lower lip. The mental foramen through which the nerve emerges, lies directly below the interval between the two bicuspid teeth. 1 Arteries of the Face.—There are two main channels concerned in conveying blood to the face, viz. (i) the tratis- verse facial artery, a branch of the superficial temporal, and already examined (p. 270); (2) the facial arte?y, a branch of the external carotid. In addition to these a great number of smaller vessels appear on the face with the sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve. Those which accom- pany the branches of the ophthalmic division are derived from the ophthalmic artery, whilst those associated with the branches of the superior and inferior maxillary divisions proceed from the internal maxillary artery. Facial Artery (arteria maxillaris externa).—The facial artery will frequently be found smaller than usual. In such ^ If a line be drawn from the supra-orbital notch to the interval between the two lower bicuspid teeth, and from that onwards to the base of the lower jaw, it will pass over or close to the infra-orbital and mental foramina. This line therefore can be used as a guide in searching for these nerves.

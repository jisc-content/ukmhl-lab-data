HEAD AND NECK. no protuberance. Its branches spread out over the back of the head, and supply a wide area of integument. It sends an auricular twig to the skin over the cranial aspect of the ear, and communicates with the small occipital nerve. Blood Vessels of the Scalp.—Two small arteries—viz., the frofital and the supra-orbital, both branches of the ophthalmic, leave the orbit to supply the forehead. The former is associated with the supra-trochlear nerve, and the latter with the supra-orbital nerve. The veins corresponding to these arteries unite at the inner margin of the orbit to form the angular vein, which afterwards becomes the facial vein. The superficial temporary artery will be noticed ascending upon the temporal fascia, immediately in front of the ear. At a variable point above the zygoma it divides into its two terminal branches—viz., the anterior and posterior super- ficial temporal arteries. The anterior superficial temporal artery takes a tortuous course upwards and forwards to the forehead, and supplies numerous branches to the integument, muscles, and peri- cranium. Further, it anastomoses with the frontal and supra-orbital arteries, and with the corresponding vessel of the opposite side. The posterior superficial temporal artery inclines upwards and backwards, arching over the cranium above the auricle. It gives off numerous twigs to the parts in this region, and communicates with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and occipital arteries. The posterior auricular artery ascends in the angle between the cartilage of the ear and the mastoid process, and ends by dividing into two branches, named respectively the auricular and the mastoid. The auricular bratich ascends under cover of the retrahens auriculam muscle, and supplies several twigs to the pinna, and, finally turning forwards above the auricle, it anastomoses with the posterior superficial temporal artery. The mastoid branch inclines

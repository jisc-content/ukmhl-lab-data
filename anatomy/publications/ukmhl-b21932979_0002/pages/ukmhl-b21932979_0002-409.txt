VERTEBRAL JOINTS. 387 greatest part of the space which exists between the vertebral bodies, and it presents the usual characters of such an articulation. The opposed bony surfaces are coated by a thin layer of hyaline or encrusting cartilage, and are brought into direct union by an interposed disc of fibro-cartilage. The intervertebral discs are distinctly deeper in front than behind, and upon this the cervical curvature of the column in great measure depends. The two diarthrodialjoints are placed one on each side, where the disc of fibro-cartilage fails. They are of small extent, and are confined entirely to the intervals between Fig. 249.â€”Coronal section through the bodies of two cervical vertebrx. (a a) The two lateral diarlhrodial joints between the bodies of two vertebras. the projecting lateral lips of the upper surface of the centrum, and the bevelled off lateral margins of the lower surface of the vertebral body immediately above. Here the bony surfaces are coated with encrusting cartilage, and are separated by a synovial cavity protected on the outer side by a feeble capsular ligament (Fig. 249, a, a). The ligaments which bind the bodies of the five lower cervical vertebrae together are the direct continuation up- wards of the anterior and the posterior common ligaments of the spine. In the removal of the spinal cord, the laminae of the vertebrte below the axis have been taken away so that

Fig. 278.—The circle of Willis and the distribution of the arteries on the under surface of the cerebrum. The following branches spring from the posterior cerebral artery :— ( Postero-mesial. f Temporal. Central or basal \ Postero-lateral. Cortical \ Calcarine. I Posterior choroidal. I Parieto-occipital. The postero-mesial central arteries arise close to the origin of the parent trunk. They proceed upwards in the interval between the crura cerebri, and piercing the locus perforatus posticus, they supply the optic thalamus and the inner part of the crus cerebri. The postero-lateral cent7-al arteries are a group of small slender twigs I

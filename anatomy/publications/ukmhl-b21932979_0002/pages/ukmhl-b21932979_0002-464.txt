442 HEAD AND NECK. when this is removed it may sometimes be noticed to break up into a fine plexus which surrounds the accompanying artery. It has already been observed to give some fine filaments to the mucous membrane of the nose. The orbital branches of the ganglion are exceedingly minute, and ascend through the spheno-maxillary fissure to supply the periosteum of the orbit. Termination of Internal Maxillary Artery.—The internal maxillary artery breaks up into its terminal branches in the spheno-maxillary fossa. These have already been traced. They are— 1. The posterior dental (arteria alveolaris superior posterior) (p. 311). 2. The infra-orbital (p. 421). 3. The descending palatine. 4. The Vidian. 5. The pterygo-palatine. 6. The spheno-palatine. The descending palatifie (arteria palatina descendens) accompanies the great or anterior palatine nerve. During its passage through the posterior palatine canal, it gives off twigs which accompany the posterior and external palatine nerves and the two inferior nasal branches of the great palatine nerve. On the hard palate it dispenses branches to the gum, mucous membrane, and glands, and sends a small branch upwards through the incisor foramen to anastomose with the naso-palatine artery. The Vidian artery (arteria Vidiana) runs backwards in the Vidian canal to supply the mucous membrane of the upper part of the pharynx and of the Eustachian tube. The pterygo-palatine artery traverses the canal of the same name, and has a corresponding distribution. The spheno-palati?ie (arteria sphenopalatina) enters the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen, and has already been followed to its distribution (p. 438). Dissection.—The facial and auditory nerves, together with the pars intermedia, have already been traced into the internal auditory meatus

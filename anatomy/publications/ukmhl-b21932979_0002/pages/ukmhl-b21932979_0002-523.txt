THE CEREBRUM. THE CEREBRUM. The Cerebral Hemispheres.â€”Each cerebral hemisphere presents an external, an internal, and an inferior surface, separated from each other by more or less distinctly marked borders. The external surface is convex, and is adapted to the concavity of the cranial vault. The internal surface is flat and perpendicular, and is more or less completely separated from the corresponding surface of the opposite side by the falx cerebri, which occupies the great longitudinal fissure. The inferior surface is irregular, and is adapted to the anterior and middle cranial fossse, and also to the upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. Traversing this surface in a transverse direction, nearer the anterior end of the hemi- sphere than the posterior end, is the stem of the Sylvian fissure (Fig. 282, e). This deep cleft divides the inferior surface into a front or orbital area, which rests upon the orbital plate of the frontal bone, and is consequently concave from side to side, and a more extensive posterior area which lies on the floor of the lateral part of the middle cranial fossa and the upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. This portion of the inferior surface is frequently termed the tentorial surface. The borders which separate these surfaces from each other are the supero-mesial, the superciliary, the infero-lateral, and the internal occipital. The supero-mesial border, con- vex from before backwards, intervenes between the internal and external surfaces. The superciliary border is highly arched, and separates the orbital surface from the external surface. The infero-lateral border marks off the tentorial surface from the external surface. The internal orbital border is not very distinct, except in cases were the brain has been hardened in situ. It extends from the posterior extremity of the hemisphere to the hinder end of the corpus callosum, and intervenes between the mesial and tentorial surfaces.

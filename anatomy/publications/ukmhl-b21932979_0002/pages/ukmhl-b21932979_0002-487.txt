465 THE LARYNX. Adavii. This is more prominent in its upper part than below, and is always more marked in the male than in the female. From the pomum Adami the two alse diverge backwards and outwards, like the limbs of the letter V) so as to enclose between them the posterior lamina of the cricoid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages. The tipper border of each ala is somewhat convex, but in front it is cut away or bevelled off, so that with the corresponding part of the opposite ala a deep median notch is formed. This is called the incistira thyroidea. The loiver bor- der is nearly straight, but is subdivided by a slight tubercle into an anterior and a posterior concave part. The posterior border is thick and rounded and gives attachment to the Fig. 269.—Cartilages of larynx seen fibres of the stylo-pharyn- from the front. (From LuscHKA.) geus and palato-pharyngeus 1.

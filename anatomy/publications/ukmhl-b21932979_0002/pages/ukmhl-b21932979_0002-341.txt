TEMPORAL AND PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGIONS. 319 reached the outer surface of the external pterygoid, and proceeds upwards to supply the fore part of the temporal muscle (Fig. 234). In some cases the long buccal nerve •may be observed to pierce the temporal muscle instead of passing under cover of it. The Auriculo-Temporal Nerve, composed of sensory fibres, springs from the posterior division of the inferior maxillary by two roots. These pass backwards under cover of the external pterygoid muscle and embrace the middle meningeal artery. Beyond this vessel they unite, and the nerve is continued backwards under cover of the neck of the lower jaw, immediately below the temporo- maxillary joint. Gaining the interval between the ear and jaw it turns upwards in relation to the deep surface of the parotid gland, and crosses the zygoma in company with the superficial temporal artery. Its further course has already been examined (p. 108). The following branches proceed from it:—(i) one or two strong branches of communication to the temporo-facial nerve; (2) a few slender filaments which enter the posterior aspect of the temporo-maxillary joint; (3) some twigs to the parotid gland; (4) terminal filaments to the skin over the temporal region and summit of the head (p. 108); (5) auri- cular branches. The auricular branches are usually hvo to the skin lining the interior of the external auditory meatus and ttvo to the integument over the upper and fore part of the pinna. The former gain the interior of the meatus by passing between the osseous and cartilaginous portions of the canal. The Inferior Dental Nerve (nervus mandibularis) is the largest branch of the inferior maxillary. Emerging from under cover of the external pterygoid muscle it passes downwards upon the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw and enters the mandibular foramen. The inferior dental artery runs downwards behind it, whilst the lingual nerve is in front of it and upon a somewhat deeper plane.

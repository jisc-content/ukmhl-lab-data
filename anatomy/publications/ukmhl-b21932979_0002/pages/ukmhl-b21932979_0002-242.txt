The Digastric Triangle may be divided very conveniently into an anterior and posterior part by the stylo-maxillary ligament and a line drawn downwards from it. The portion in front has a distinct floor, composed, in great part, by the mylo-hyoid muscle, and behind this by a portion of the hyo- glossus muscle. The parts exposed during the dissection of the digastric space may be classified according to the subdivision in which they lie :â€” Anterior Part. Posterior Part. 1. Submaxillary gland. 2. Facial artery and vein. 3. Branches from \ a. Ascending palatine. facial artery |_ b. Tonsillitic. in this part | c. Submaxillary, of its course, j d. Submental. 4. Hypoglossal nerve. 5. Mylo-hyoid nerve. 6. Mylo-hyoid artery. 7. Lymphatic glands. 1. Portion of the parotid gland. 2. External carotid ar- tery. 3. Posterior auricular artery. The most conspicuous object in the fore part of the digastric triangle is the submaxillary gland. The facial artery passes upwards and forwards in the midst of this gland, whilst the facial vein lies superficial to it. But whilst the facial artery runs through the gland, the dissector should note that it can be separated from it without any laceration of the gland lobules. The gland is, as it were, wrapped round it, so that, although at first sight the artery seems to pierce it, it is in reality merely contained in a deep furrow in its substance. Before entering the gland, the facial

HEAD AND NECK. 28o The Compressor Naris is a flat triangular muscle which springs by a pointed fleshy origin from the superior maxillary bone close to the margin of the anterior nasal aperture and under cover of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi. From this it extends inwards and upwards, and expands into an aponeurosis, which covers the cartilaginous part of the nose, and in the mesial plane becomes continuous with the corresponding aponeurosis of the opposite side. The Pyramidalis Nasi is a narrow slip of muscular fibres which springs from the aponeurosis of the compressor naris, and passes upwards upon the nasal bone. Some of the fibres gain a direct insertion into the skin over the lower part of the forehead; others are continuous with the fasciculi of the frontalis muscle. The Depressor Alae Nasi is a minute muscle, the origin of which has already been displayed by the removal of the mucous membrane at the side of the frtenum of the upper lip. It springs from the incisor fossa of the superior maxilla above and to the inner side of the superior incisive slip of the orbicularis oris muscle. Its outer margin is usually more or less blended with the compressor naris, and its fibres arch upwards and forwards to become attached to the lower and back part of both the ala and the septum of the nose. The Dilatator Muscles can rarely be satisfactorily dis- played. The fibres which compose them are pale and feeble, and they are embedded in the dense tissue at the lower and outer part of the nose immediately above the aperture. An attterior slip (levator proprius alte nasi anterior) is placed on the lower part of the side of the nose towards the fore part of the nostril, and a posterior slip (levator proprius alte nasi posterior) at a short distance behind this. Nerves of the Face.â€”The nerves in this region may be divided into two sets according as they supply the skin or the muscles of the face. The motor nerve is the nervus

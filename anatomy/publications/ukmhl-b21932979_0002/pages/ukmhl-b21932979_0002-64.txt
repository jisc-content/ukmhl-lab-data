On the exterior of the heart there are markings which indicate this internal subdivision, and enable us to map out with the greatest accuracy the walls of the four cham- bers. Thus encircling the heart in transverse direction, nearer the base than the apex, is a deep furrow which is aortic arcli left pulmonary artery left pulmonary- vein'-' vena cava superior. -right pulmonary artery. 5 right pulmonary veins. vena cava in- ferior.

It in- tervenes between the auricles which lie above it and the ventricles which are placed below it. In the undissected heart, with the epicardium in position, the depth of this furrow is somewhat obscured, from the fact that it lodges some large blood vessels and a certain amount of fat.

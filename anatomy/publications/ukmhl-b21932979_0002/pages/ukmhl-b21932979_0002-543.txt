521 THE CEREBRUM. fissure of Sylvius, together with the artificial line which is drawn backwards from this. On the tentorial surface it is separated from the hippocampal part of the limbic lobe by the collateral fissure, whilst behind, it is marked off from the occipital lobe by the arbitrary lines already described (p. 514). The apex or temporal pole projects forwards on the under surface of the brain beyond the stem of the Sylvian fissure. It should be noticed that the recurved extremity of the hippocampal part of the limbic lobe (uncus) which lies to the inner side of the temporal pole does not project so far forwards as the latter, and is separated from the pole by the incisura temporalis. This sulcus may be regarded as the connecting link between the anterior ends of the collateral fissure and the inferior limiting sulcus of Reil.^ Upper or Opercular Surface of the Temporal Lobe.—This is the surface of the temporal operculum which is opposed to the island of Reil and the fronto-parietal operculum. The fissure of Sylvius must therefore be widely opened up to expose it. For the most part the surface is smooth, but towards its back part there are a few shallow transverse furrows, called the sulci of Heschl, whilst in front, on the deep aspect of the temporal pole, two or three furrows are also evident. Outer Surface of the Temporal Lobe.—On this aspect of the lobe there are two horizontal sulci, called respectively the first temporal, or parallel, and the second temporal sulcus. The parallel sulcus (Fig. 282, t^) is a long continuous and deep fissure which begins near the temporal pole, and proceeds backwards below the posterior limb- of the Sylvian fissure. Its hinder end turns upwards into the parietal lobe, and is surrounded by the angular gyrus. ^ The importance of this connection is evident when we remember that, strictly speaking, the inferior limiting sulcus of Reil is the true upper limit of the temporal lobe.

446 HEAD AND NECK. can easily be opened up in a decalcified bone, but is some- what difficult to expose in the hard bone. The chorda tympani now runs forwards upon the upper part of the membrana tympani under cover of the mucous layer. It crosses the handle of the malleus near its root. To display it in this part of its course, the incus bone should be removed. Finally, reaching the anterior end of the tympanic cavity it crosses the processus gracilis of the malleus, and near the inner end of the Glaserian fissure, it enters a canal (canal of Huguier) which conducts it to the exterior of the skull. With a little care the canal of Huguier can be opened up by the chisel and bone-pliers. From this point to its junction with the lingual nerve the chorda tympani has already been traced (p. 320). The Auditory Nerve.—In the internal auditory meatus the auditory nerve lies at a lower level than the facial, and at the bottom of the passage it splits into two parts. Of these, one is directed forwards to the cochlea, and the other proceeds outwards to the vestibule. THE LARYNX. The lateral portions of the lower jaw which are still attached by mucous membrane to the sides of the tongue should be removed, and the dissection of the larynx com- menced. General Construction and Position.—The larynx con- stitutes the upper expanded portion of the air-passage, specially modified for the production of the voice. Its walls are composed of cartilages, muscles, ligaments, and an in- ternal lining of mucous membrane. Before proceeding with the dissection the student should study the form and connections of the nine laryngeal cartilages in a permanent specimen {v. p. 463). The larynx is placed in the upper and fore part of the neck, where it forms a marked projection. It lies below

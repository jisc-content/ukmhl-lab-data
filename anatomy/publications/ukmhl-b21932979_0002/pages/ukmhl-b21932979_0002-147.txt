I REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 125 T\ie posterior border of the tentorium is convex. Behind it is attached to the horizontal ridges which mark the deep sur- face of the occipital bone, and beyond this, on each side, to the posterior inferior angle of the parietal bone; laterally it is firmly fixed to the upper border of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. In the former situation it encloses between its two layers the lateral blood sinuses,—Fig. 192 (7)—and in the latter the superior petrosal blood sinus on each side. The anterior border is sharp, free, and concave (incisiira tentorii), and forms, with the dorsum sellee of the sphenoid, an oval opening within which the mesen- cephalon is placed. Beyond the apex of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone the two margins of the ten- torium cross each other like the limbs of the letter X j the free margin is carried forwards to be attached to the anterior clinoid process, whilst the attached border is continued inwards to be fixed to the posterior clinoid process (Fig. 193). Falx Cerebelli.—This is a small falciform fold of dura mater placed under the tentorium, which extends forwards in the mesial plane from the internal occipital crest. It occupies the notch which separates the two lateral hemi- spheres of the cerebellum posteriorly. Above, it is attached to the posterior part of the under surface of the tentorium. Its anterior border is free ; whilst inferiorly, it bifurcates into two small diverging ridges, which gradually fade away as they are traced forwards on either side of the foramen magnum.

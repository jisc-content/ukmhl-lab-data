REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 135 this be done successfully, the body will be seen to be an oval structure, slightly flattened from above downwards, and with its long axis directed transversely. Further, it may be noticed to consist of a large anterior lobe, and a smaller posterior lobe. The former of these is hollowed out behind so as to form a concavity for the lodgment of the latter. If a horizontal section be made through the body, the line of separation between the two lobes is very distinct. The infundibulum which connects the pituitary body with the tuber cinereum of the brain is continued into the posterior Fig. 195.â€”I. Pituitary body ; 2. In mesial section ; 3.

Thus, even in the adult, we have a clue to the different modes of development of the two lobes. The posterior lobe is derived from the brain, whilst the anterior lobe is an off-shoot from the primitive buccal cavity. The dissectors of the head and neck must now prepare for the chang- ing of the position of the subject. Some tow, or a sponge, soaked in a mixture of methylated spirit and carbolic acid, should be introduced into the cranial cavity. The skull-cap should then be replaced and retained in position by bringing thte scalp flaps over it, and stitching them accurately together. It is a very common practice with students,

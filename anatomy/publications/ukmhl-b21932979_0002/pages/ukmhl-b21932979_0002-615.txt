INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF PONS VAROLII. 591 viz., a ventral and a dorsal. Broadly speaking, the ventral part corre- sponds with the pyramidal parts of the medulla, and the f)edal parts of the crura cerebri; whilst the dorsal part corresponds with the formatio reticularis of the medulla and the tegmental part of the crura cerebri. The ventral part of the pons is the larger of the two subdivisions. It is composed of a large number of transverse bundles of fibres, through the midst of which the longitudinal bundles of the pyramids are carried upwards, to ultimately enter the crustse of the crura cerebri. Scattered amongst these fibres we have a certain amount of grey matter termed the nucleipontis. In the lower part of the pons the pyramids are seen in the form of one solid bundle on each side; almost immedi- FiG. 316.â€”Transverse section through the upper part of the pons.

Of the transverse fibres two distinct sets may be recognised, viz., the superficial transverse fibres, through the midst

HEAD AND NECK. 426 nasal spine. The anterior angle of the septal cartilage is blunt and rounded, and does not reach to the point of the nose, which is thus formed by the cartilages of the aperture (P- 303)- The deviation of the septum nasi from the mesial plane will now (in all probability) be seen to be due to a bulging to one side of the vomer and mes-ethmoid along their line of union. It is not developed until after the seventh year of life (Zuckerkandl). Dissection.—The septal cartilage and thin bony laininse must now be removed piecemeal. This must be done very carefully, as it is necessary to preserve intact the mucous membrane v^^hich clothes the opposite side of the septum. It is in this that the nerves and blood vessels must be examined. Vessels and Nerves of the Septum Nasi.—The following is a list of the nerves :— Nerves of Smell, . Olfactory. /•I. Naso-palatine, or nerve of Cotunnius. Nerves of Common | 2. Septal branch of the nasal nerve proper. Sensation, . • 13- Nasal branches from Meckel's gang- lion and the Vidian nerve. ThQ i?tner group of olfactory nerves \fi\\\Q}s\ are distributed in the mucous membrane of the upper part of the nasal septum are barely distinguishable, except in a fresh part; further, they are so soft that it is hardly possible to isolate them. They enter the nasal fossa through the inner series of apertures in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and proceed downwards in grooves on the surface of the per- pendicular plate of the same bone. Upon the deep surface of the mucous membrane they form a close meshed plexus of nerves. The naso-palatitie nerve (nerve of Cotunnius) is a long slender twig which can easily be detected upon the deep surface of the mucous lining of the septum. It springs from Meckel's ganglion, and enters the nasal fossa through the spheno-palatine foramen. In the first part of its course

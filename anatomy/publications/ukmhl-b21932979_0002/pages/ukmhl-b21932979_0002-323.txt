The lachrymal sac, therefore, lies between the internal tarsal ligament and the tensor tarsi, and although anatomists are not quite agreed as to the exact mode of action of this muscle, there can be little doubt that it must be looked Fig. 232.â€”The inner wall of the orbit.

By its contraction it either aids the propulsion of the fluid through the lachrymal sac, or, by pulling on the tarsal plates, it places the puncta in a more favourable position for the entrance of the tears.

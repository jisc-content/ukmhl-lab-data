HEAD AND NECK. 314 lines the lower compartment. This is owing to the articular surface of the temporal bone being of larger size than the condylar surface. Movements.—The movements which the mandible can perform at the temporo-maxillary joint are the following:—(l) depression; (2) elevation; (3) protraction; (4) retraction; (5) lateral or chewing movements. When the lower jaw is depressed the interarticular fibro- cartilage with the condyle of the mandible moves forwards in the glenoid fossa, and the latter finally takes up a position on the eminentia articularis. This forward gliding of cartilage and condyle in the upper compartment of the joint is accompanied by another movement in the lower compartment of the joint, which consists in a rotation of the / Fig. 235.—Diagram of the different positions occupied by the head of the mandible and the inter-articular car- tilage as the mouth is opened and closed. condyle of the mandible on the lower surface of the interarticular fibro- cartilage. Elevation of the mandible or closure of the mouth is brought about by a reverse series of changes in both compartments of the joint. Whilst these movements are going on the mandible rotates around a transverse axis which traverses the bone in the neighbourhood of the mandibular foramen. This is the point, therefore, of least movement, and consequently in opening and shutting the mouth the inferior dental vessels and nerves are not unduly stretched. In protraction and re- traction the movement is chiefly confined to the upper compartment of the joint. The condyle of the mandible with the interarticular fibro- cartilage glides forwards and backwards upon the temporal articular surface. In the lateral movements of the jaw the mandible is carried alternately from side to side, as in the process of chewing.

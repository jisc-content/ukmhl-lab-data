605 VESTIBULE. bone. They contain hollow membranous structures in con- nection with which the filaments of the auditory nerve end. We therefore recognise an osseous and a membranous labyrinth. The osseous labyrinth is composed of an intermediate chamber termed the vestibule, behind which are placed the three semicircular canals, whilst in front is the cochlea. All these cavities communicate with each other. The corres- ponding membranous parts do not completely occupy the osseous chambers and the intervening space is filled with a fluid termed the perilymph. The membranous labyrinth also contains a fluid which receives the name of endolymph. 1. Superior semicircular canal. 2. Common opening of superior and posterior semicircular canals. 3.

Vestibule.—Thevestibule is a small ovoidal bony chamber, the antero-posterior diameter of which is about the sixth-of- an-inch in length. It is situated between the inner wall of the tympanum and the bottom of the internal auditory meatus. Into the back part of the vestibule the three semicircular canals open by five round apertures; whilst in its lower and fore part is the opening of the scala vestibuli of the cochlea. On the outer wall is the fenestra ovalis, which is closed in the recent state by the delicate periosteal lining of the

SCALP. 103 (4) a layer of loose areolar tissue; and (5) the periosteum, which is here termed the pericranium. Below the level of the temporal ridges additional struc- tures are observed coating the cranium. As many as eight layers may be re- cognised, viz.—(i) skin; (2) superficial fascia; (3) the small extrinsic muscles of the ear; (4) the thin lateral part of the epicranial aponeu- rosis; (s) a thin layer of fascia de- scending from the temporal ridge to the pinna; (6) the temporal fascia; (7) the temporal muscle; (8) the periosteum. The scalp is richly supplied with both nerves and blood vessels. Dissection.—The dissector should place a block under the head so as to raise it to a convenient height, and proceed with the dissection. Three incisions through the skin are required, viz.—(i) from the root of the nose along the middle line of the cranium, to a point a little beyond the external occipital protuberance ; (2) from the tip of the mastoid process on one side, over the summit of the head to a corre- sponding point upon the opposite side ; (3) from the point where the latter incision reaches the pinna downwards in front of the auricle to the root of the zygoma. Four flaps of skin are thus marked out, and these should be carefully raised from the subjacent superficial fascia. This, however, is no easy matter, owing to the very firm connection which exists between them. The roots of the hair which pierce the integument obliquely, and are embedded in the superficial fascia, add another difficulty to the proper reflection of the integument. Superficial Fascia.—On the summit of the cranium the superficial fascia, although thin, is exceedingly dense and tough, owing to strong septa of fibrous tissue which bind it Fig. 185.—Section through the scalp and cranial wall.

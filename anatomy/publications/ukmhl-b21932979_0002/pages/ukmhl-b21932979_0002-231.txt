SIDE OF THE NECK. 209 constant. The fifth and sixth nerves unite to form an upper trunk ; the seventh nerve remains single and proceeds downwards as a middle trunk; and the eighth cervical and first dorsal nerves join, whilst still under cover of the scalenus anticus, to constitute a third or lozver trunk. Whilst still within the posterior triangle of the neck each trunk splits into an anterior and a posterior division. Raise the three anterior divisions on the handle of the knife, and then it will be seen that the three posterior divisions unite to form the posterior cord of the plexus, and, further, that the innermost of these divisions is much smaller than the other two. Of the three anterior divisions the outer two join to constitute the outer cord, whilst the innermost is carried down by itself as the itiner cord of the plexus. From the three cords of the brachial plexus are given off the branches which supply the upper limb. From the above description it will be seen that the plexus, from changes which are effected in the arrangement of its fibres, may be divided into four stages :— 1st Stage. 2nd Stage. 3rd Stage. 4th Stage. 5 separate nerves (viz., 4 lower cervical and first dorsal). 3 nervous trunks (viz., an upper, middle, and lower). 3 anterior divisions and 3 posterior divisions. 3 nervous cords (viz., an outer, inner, and a posterior). The first three of these stages are generally observed in the lower part of the posterior triangle and in the upper part of the axilla. It must be understood, however, that the points at which division and union of the different parts of the plexus takes place are subject to some variation. Supra-clavicular Branches of the Brachial Plexus.—The only branches of the brachial plexus which fall to the lot of the dissector of the head and neck, are those given off above VOL. II. —14

SCALP. 109 be able to trace twigs from these as far as the summit of the head. Its branches terminate in the skin of the scalp. In the mastoid and occipital regions of the scalp, the dissector will meet with four nerves, each from a different source ; {a) the posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve —Fig. 186 (3); {b) the mastoid branch of the great auricular nerve; {c) the small occipital nerve from the anterior primary division of the second cervical nerve—Fig. 186 (8); and (^) the great occipital nerve from the posterior primary division of the second cervical nerve—Fig. 186 (4). The posterior auricular is a small nerve which ascends upon the front of the mastoid process, immediately behind the ear. The guide to it is the posterior auricular artery, which lies in contact with it. After effecting a communica- tion with the great auricular nerve, it divides into an auricular and an occipital division. The auricular division continues its upward course, and ends by supplying the retrahens auriculam and attollens auriculam muscles; the occipital division inclines backwards along the superior curved line of the occipital bone, and ends in the occipital belly of the occipito-frontalis muscle. In searching for the posterior auricular nerve, the dissector will, in all probability, meet with the mastoid branch of the great auricular nerve, which ascends upon the mastoid pro- cess on a more superficial plane. The small occipital nerve will be discovered midway between the ear and the external occipital protuberance. It supplies numerous branches to the integument, and furnishes an auricular ttvig to the skin over the upper part of the cranial aspect of the ear. It communicates with the great auricular nerve on the one hand, and with the great occipital nerve on the other. The great occipital is a large nerve, and there will be little difficulty experienced in finding it, as it lies close to the occipital artery, a short distance external to the occipital

DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 277 these bones as far forwards as the first molar tooth. Behi?id, its posterior border is attached to the pterygo-maxillary liga- ment, which acts as the bond of union between it and the superior constrictor muscle of the pharynx. This attach- ment cannot be studied at present, but will be afterwards examined in the dissection of the pharyngeal wall. An- teriorly, it abuts against the angle of the mouth, and its fibres blend with the orbicularis oris, a large part of which it forms. But the manner in which the fibres of this muscle enter the orbicularis must be examined. The upper and lower fibres pass directly into the corresponding lip; the middle fibres, on the other hand, decussate at the angle of Fig. 225. the mouth, so that the lower fibres of this series enter the upper lip, whilst the higher fasciculi reach the lower lip. Orbicularis Oris.â€”The orbicularis oris is composed of fleshy fasciculi which sweep round the oral aperture in the interval between the skin and mucous membrane, and form a considerable part of the substance of the two lips. Its upper margin extends upwards as high as the nose, whilst its lower margin corresponds to the groove on the face which intervenes between the chin and the lower lip. The fibres which compose the orbicularis oris are derived from many different sources. The chief bulk of the muscle is formed by the continuation into the lips of fibres which belong to the buccinator, the levator anguli oris, and the depressor anguli oris of each side. The fasciculi of the

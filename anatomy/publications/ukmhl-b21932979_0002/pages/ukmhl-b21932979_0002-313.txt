291 DISSECTION OF THE FACE. border of the masseter muscle, and at the base of the lower jaw the two vessels come together. Numerous tributaries join the facial vein as it courses through the face, and a large branch called the deep facial connects it with the pterygoid plexus of veins. The Auricle or Pinna.—Before dissecting the auricle, it is well to learn the names of its various parts, and note the position which they hold in relation to each other. The concha is the wide and deep fossa which leads into the external meatus ; the antiheHx is the prominence which bounds this posteriorly; the helix is the folded or incurved margin of the pinna; and the lobtile is its soft dependent fossa triangularis, crus antihelicis. concha. crus helicis. tragus. incisura inter-tragica.

The concha is partially subdivided into an upper and a lower part by the commencement of the helix, which curves upwards and forwards on its floor to become con- tinuous with the anterior border of the pinna. This portion of the helix is called the crus helicis. A small prominence in front of the meatus, and projecting backwards so as to overshadow it, is termed the tragus, whilst a similar eminence behind and below the meatus receives the name of the anti- iragus. The notch between these two prominences is termed the incisura ijiier-tragica. But it will be noted that the upper end of the anti-helix bifurcates, and in this way two fossce are marked off from each other; one—the fossa crus antihelicis Darwin's tubercle fossa scaphoidia helix anti-tragus lobulus

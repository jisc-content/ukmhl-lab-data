358 HEAD AND NECK. divides into an upper and a lower division. During their passage through the sphenoidal fissure the various nerves undergo a change in their relative positions. This, how- ever, will be studied in the dissection of the orbit when that fissure is opened up. Internal Carotid Artery.—The intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery may now be examined. It lies upon the lateral aspect of the body of the sphenoid, and for the greater part of its course it traverses the cavernous sinus. It enters the cranium by emerging from the carotid canal at the apex of the petrous bone, and it first ascends vertically until it reaches the root of the posterior clinoid process ; here it makes a bend and is prolonged forwards to the inner aspect of the anterior clinoid process where it abruptly turns upwards and pierces the dura mater imme- diately behind the entrance of the optic nerve into the optic foramen. At this point it has been severed in the removal of the brain, but it will be afterwards seen to end at the commencement of the Sylvian fissure of the brain, by dividing into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Throughout its whole course it is surrounded by sympathetic filaments, and soon after its entrance into the cranium, the abducent nerve winds round its outer side. The intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery gives off the following branches :— 1. Branches to the pituitary body, ^ These are minute twigs 2. Branches to the Gasserian ganglion, - which arise in the 3. Branches to the dura mater, ) cavernous sinus. 4. Ophthalmic, The Cavernous Plexus.—The sympathetic filaments which form this plexus can only be satisfactorily dissected in a subject which has not been injected, and even then, the dissection is an exceedingly difficult one.

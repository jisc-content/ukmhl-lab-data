HEAD AND NECK. 254 These relations cannot be seen at present, but they will afterwards be exposed when the face is dissected. It should be noted that while the artery is in the gland it lies much nearer its deep than its superficial surface. Indeed, sections through the parotid region of the frozen head show that in reality only a very small part of the terminal portion of the artery is enclosed within the gland. Below this it merely lies in a groove on the deep surface of the parotid (Fig. 223, p. 267). At its commencement, the external carotid artery lies in relation to the pharynx. Higher up it rests upon the stylo- pharyngeus muscle, the styloid process and the glosso- pharyngeal nerve—three structures which intervene between it and the internal carotid artery. Branches of the External Carotid.—As the external carotid ascends, it diminishes rapidly in calibre, owing to the numerous large branches which it gives off. It is customary to classify these, according to the direction which they take, into the following groups :— Superior thyroid, . .^ Lingual, . . . I Directed forwards and Facial j inwards. Internal maxillary, But these are not the only branches which come off from the external carotid. Small twigs are also given to the parotid gland, and to the masseter and internal pterygoid muscles. The Superior Thyroid Artery (arteria thyreoidea superior) arises within the carotid triangle, from the fore part of the external carotid close to its origin. From this it takes a curved course downwards and forwards, under cover of the omo- hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles, and ends by

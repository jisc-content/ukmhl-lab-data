395 CRANIO- VERTEBRAL JOINTS. The vertical part of the cruciform ligament consists of an upper and a lower limb, which are termed the appendices or crura. Both are attached to the dorsal surface of the trans- verse ligament. The cms superius is the longer and flatter of the two, and extends upwards on the posterior aspect of the head of the odontoid process to be attached to the posterior aspect of the basilar process immediately beyond the anterior margin of the foramen magnum (Fig. 250, 8 ; and Fig. 251, 2 and 6). The cms hiferius, very much shorter, Fig. 252.—Transverse section through the atlas and odontoid process. (From Cruveilhier, slightly modified.) Odontoid process. Synovial cavity between the odontoid process and anterior arch of atlas. Synovial cavity between the odontoid process and the transverse ligament. 4. Transverse ligament. 5. Posterior occipito-a.\ial ligament. 6. Vertebral vein. 7. Vertebral artery. 8. Tube of dura mater. extends downwards, and is fixed to the posterior aspect of the body of the axis vertebra (Fig. 250, 12 ; and Fig. 251, 3). Dissection.—Detach the appendi.x superior from the basilar process, and throw it downwards. The suspensory ligament is thus displayed, and a better view of the alar or check ligaments obtained. The Suspensory Ligament (ligamentum apicis dentis) (Fig. 250, 7 ; and Fig. 251, 8) of the odontoid consists of

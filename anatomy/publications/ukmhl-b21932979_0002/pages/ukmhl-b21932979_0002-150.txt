128 HEAD AND NECK. aperture of exit in the dura mater, and therefore receives a separate sheath of dura mater, whilst the vagus and spinal accessory have a common aperture, and a common sheath of both arachnoid and dura mater. They all leave the skull through the middle compartment of the jugular fossa. The spinal accessory has already been noticed ascending from the spinal canal. The hypoglossal nerve pierces the dura mater opposite the anterior condyloid foramen at two separate points, in the form of two distinct slips. These unite in the foramen. Venous Blood Sinuses.—The blood sinuses which traverse the dura mater should next be examined. Each should be opened in turn by running the knife through the dura mater which forms its wall. The following is a list of these sinuses:— 1. Suj^erior longitudinal. 2. Inferior longitudinal. 3. Straight. 4. Occipital. 5. Cavernous. 6. Spheno-parietal. 7. Circular. 8. Superior petrosal. 9. Inferior petrosal. 10. Basilar. As already pointed out, the cranial blood sinuses are in some cases formed by a separation of the two layers of the dura mater; in other cases they are formed in the redupli- cations of the inner layer of the dura mater which constitute the partitions. The channels thus constituted are lined by a smooth membrane, which is continuous with the internal coat of the veins. Torcular Herophili (confluens sinuum).—The superior longitudinal sinus has been already examined, except at the point where it terminates. The dissector should notice that as it descends upon the deep surface of the occipital bone, it, as a rule, inclines slightly to one or other side of the mesial plane, more usually to the right side, and in this way it terminates upon one side of the internal occipital pro- tuberance. Here it is somewhat dilated, and then turns suddenly outwards, to form the lateral sinus of that side.

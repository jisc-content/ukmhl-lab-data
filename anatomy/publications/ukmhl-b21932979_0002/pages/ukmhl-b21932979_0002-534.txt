THE BRAIN. terminal branches spread out widely from each other, and together constitute a transverse furrow called the sulcus fronto-marginalis (Wernicke). Owing to the subdivision of the superior and middle frontal convolutions in the manner indicated, the typical arrangement of the convolutions in the anterior part of the outer surface of the frontal lobe is in five horizontal tiers, and not in three tiers as previously described. The inferior frontal convoiutiofi possesses a very special interest and importance, on account of the locaUsation within it, on the left side, of the speech-centre. It is cut up into three parts by the two anterior limbs of the fissure of Sylvius. These are termed the pars basilaris, the pars triangularis, and the pars orbitalis. The pars basilaris (Fig. 283, A), is that part which lies between the vertical limb of the inferior prsecentral sulcus and the ascending limb of the Sylvian fissure. It forms the anterior portion of the fronto-parietal operculum, and it is traversed in an oblique direction by a shallow but constant furrow, termed the sulcus diagonalis (Fig. 283, d). The pars triangularis (Fig. 283, B) is simply another name for the frontal operculum. It is triangular in form, and lies between the ascending and anterior horizontal limbs of the Sylvian fissure. The pars orbitalis (Fig. 283, C) is placed below the anterior horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. Mesial Surface of the Frontal Lobe.â€”On this aspect of the frontal lobe there is an elongated, more or less con- tinuous, convolution called the gyncs inargiiialis. It lies between the supero-mesial border of the hemisphere and the calloso-marginal fissure (Fig. 284). In the fore part of this gyrus one or two curved sulci are usually present. These are termed the sulci rostrales (Fig. 284, ro). Further, the posterior part of the marginal convolution is more or less completely cut off from the portion which lies in front. This part is called the paracentral lobule, and

354 HEAD AND NECK. The cavernous sinus is formed in the same manner as the other venous sinuses. The two layers of the dura mater are separated from each other, and the interval is lined by a delicate membrane. A complicated network of interlacing trabeculge occupies the lumen of the channel, and it is on this account that the term " cavernous" is applied to it. But, as we have already indicated, this sinus has an unusual importance to the anatomist, on account of its being traversed by the internal carotid artery, the cavernous plexus, and the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducent nerves, with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The precise relation which these structures bear to its walls will Fig. 241.—Section through the cavernous sinus. (After Merkel, somewhat modified). be described later on; in the meantime, it is only necessary to state that, two, viz., the internal carotid artery and the abducent nerve, are contained in the interval between the two layers of the dura mater. These are shut out from the blood-channel by the delicate lining membrane of the sinus. The oculomotor and trochlear nerves, with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, are embedded in the outer wall of the sinus. The Trigeminal or Fifth Cranial Nerve.—The two roots of this nerve have already been seen piercing the dura mater at the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone

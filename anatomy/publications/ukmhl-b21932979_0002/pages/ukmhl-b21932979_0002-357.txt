DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. 335 divided into three parts—viz. (i) a cervical; (2) a petrous; and (3) an intracranial. The cervical part alone comes under the notice of the student in the present dissection. In the first instance, the internal carotid artery is placed within the carotid triangle, and is, therefore, comparatively superficial. It is covered by the integument, platysma, and fascia, and is overlapped by the sterno-mastoid muscle. As it proceeds upwards, it gradually sinks deeply, until it comes to lie under cover of the entire mass of the parotid gland, the styloid process, the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, the stylo- hyoid muscle, and the posterior belly of the digastric. Three nerves and two arteries will also be noticed to cross the vessel superficially, viz.:— 1. The occipital artery. 2. The posterior auricular artery- 1. The hypoglossal nerve. 2. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 3. The pharyngeal branch of the vagus ner\'e. The relationship of the external carotid artery to the internal carotid is a varying one. At first the external carotid lies in front of it, but soon, owing to its inclination backwards, it comes to lie directly superficial to the internal carotid. The following structures intervene between the two vessels :— 4. Pharyngeal branch of vagus. 5. A portion of the parotid gland. 1. Styloid process. 2. Stylo-pharyngeus muscle. 3. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. Behind, the internal carotid rests upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, and is in contact with the vagus nerve and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. To its outer side is the internal jugular vein. A prolongation upwards of the carotid sheath encloses the two vessels together with the vagus nerve. On its inner aspect the internal carotid is related to the pharynx and the tonsil. At the same time it should be noted that the relationship to the tonsil is not so close as has generally been supposed. This may be seen in Fig. 223, p. 267, which represents a section

SIDE OF THE NECK. head the hyoid bone will be observed to be placed on a level with the lower margin of the mandible. Above the hyoid bone, between it and the symphysis of the lower jaw, is the anterior part of the floor of the mouth. Dissection.—In the first instance merely the structures superficial to the deep cervical fascia should be dissected. A good-sized block being placed under the shoulders of the subject, the head is pulled backwards and the chin dragged over to the opposite side. The parts will be put still further on the stretch if the shoulder be depressed by drawing the arm downwards and then fixing it in this position. For the reflection of the skin three incisions are required, viz.— (i) a vertical incision along the middle line of the neck, from the chin above to the sternum below ; (2) a transverse cut from the lower Fig. 207. end of the mesial incision outwards along the line of the clavicle to the acromion process of the scapula ; (3) an oblique incision, beginning above at the mastoid process behind the ear, and carried downwards and forwards along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, until it meets the middle line of the neck at the top of the sternum. Two triangular flaps of skin, corresponding in a measure to the two triangular areas of the neck, are thus mapped out, and must now be care- fully raised. Throw the anterior flap upwards towards the lower jaw, and turn the posterior flap backwards towards the trapezius muscle. Superficial Fascia.—The superficial fascia in this region contains in its midst the platysma myoides muscle—the representative in the human subject of the panniculus

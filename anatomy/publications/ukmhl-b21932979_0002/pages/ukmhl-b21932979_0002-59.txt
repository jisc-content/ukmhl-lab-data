THORACIC CAVITY. 37 Innominate Veins.—^The innominate vein of each side is formed behind the sternal end of the clavicle by the union of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. Behind the lowfer part of the junction of the first costal cartilage of the right side with the sternum, they unite to form the superior vena cava. The right innofiiinate vein (vena anonyma dextra) is short. It is not more than one inch in length, and it has a nearly vertical course from above downwards. Its outer surface is covered with pleura and is in relation to the phrenic nerve. The upper part of the innominate artery lies to its inner side. The left innominate vein (vena anonyma sinistra) is much longer than the right vein, and has an oblique course from the left downwards and to the right. It is placed behind the manubrium sterni and the remains of the thymus gland, and crosses the three great arteries which spring from the aortic arch. The innominate vein of each side receives the following tributaries :— 1. The vertebral vein. 2. The inferior thyroid vein. 3. The vein which drains the blood from the first or highest inter- costal space. 4. The internal mammary vein. The left innominate vein in addition receives the left superior intercostal vein, and some small venous twigs from the thymus gland. The left stcperior intercostal vein is formed by the union of the veins from the second and third inter- costal spaces. It crosses the arch of the aorta, and is of interest in so far that its upper part represents the upper pervious portion of the occluded left superior vena cava of the embryo. The Vena Cava Superior should also be examined at this stage. It is formed behind the first costo-sternal junc- tion of the right side by the union of the two innominate veins. From this it proceeds downwards, and it opens into

HEAD AND NECK. i6o The Rotatores Spinas (submultifidus) are a series of small muscles which may be exposed by raising the multifidus. In the dorsal region each muscle springs from the root of a transverse process, and is inserted into the lamina of the vertebra immediately above, close to the root of the spinous process. Somewhat similar muscles have been described in the cervical and lumbar regions, and also a series of longer and more superficial slips which connect alternate vertebrae with each other (Hughes). Interspinales and Intertransversales.—The dissector should next examine the minute interspinous and inter- transverse muscles. The interspi7ions muscles can hardly be said to exist in the dorsal region, except in its upper and lower part, where they are present in a rudimentary condition. In the neck they are arranged in pairs—two occupying eath interspinous interval, with the exception of that between the axis and atlas. In the lumbar region they are also well marked and in pairs; here they are attached to the whole length of the spinous processes. The intertransverse muscles (intertransversarii) are strongly developed in the lumbar region, and occupy the entire length of the intertransverse intervals. Additional rounded fasciculi may be observed passing between the accessory processes. These are termed the interaccessorit. In the dorsal region intertransverse muscles—very weak and poorly developed—are only found in the lower three or four spaces. In the cervical region the intertransversales are present in pairs. They will be better examined at a subsequent period. Levatores Costarum.—These constitute a series of twelve fan-shaped muscles, which pass from the transverse processes to the ribs. To bring them thoroughly into view, the longissimus dorsi, ilio-costalis, and accessorius muscles should be removed. The first muscle of the series springs

THE CEREBRUM. 545 interpositum, and project downwards into the third ventricle. These are the choroid plexuses of the third ventricle (Fig. 297). The most conspicuous blood vessels in the velum inter- positum are the two veins of Galen, which run backwards— one*on either side of the mesial plane. In front, each is formed at the apex of the fold by the union of the vein of the corpus striatum with a large vein issuing from the choroid plexus ; behind, they unite to form the vena magna Fig. 297.—Diagrammatic coronal section through the optic thalami and the parts in immediate relation to them. The intermediate part of the great transverse fissure hold- ing the velum interpositum is seen, and also the manner in which this fissure is shut out from the lateral ventricles by the epithelium which covers the choroid plexus on each side. Galeni, and this pours its blood into the anterior end of the straight sinus (Fig. 191). Great Transverse Fissure.—This name is given to the con- tinuous cleft through which the velum interpositum and the choroid plexuses of the two descending horns of the lateral ventricles are introduced into the interior of the brain. It consists of an upper and intermediate part and two lateral VOL. n.—3.5

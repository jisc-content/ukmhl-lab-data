The supra-mandibular division of the facial nerve will also be noticed on the surface of the lower jaw. Its branches disappear under cover of the depressor anguli oris. All these nerves must be carefully followed out as the muscles are being exposed and cleaned. Zygomaticus Major, Risorius, and Depressor Anguli Oris.â€”These three muscles may be grouped together, seeing that they He in the same plane and run towards the angle of the mouth. The platysma also occupies the same plane, iti. labii depressor anguli oris. Fig. 224. and many of its fibres blend with the depressor anguli oris, whilst others are carried forwards into the risorius. The Zygomaticus Major is a long fleshy band which springs from the malar bone immediately in front of the zygomatic suture. From this it proceeds downwards and forwards, and at the angle of the mouth some of its fibres are inserted into the skin, whilst others blend with the orbi- cularis oris and with the depressor anguli oris. The Risorius is sometimes regarded as a continuation forwards on the face of the posterior fibres of the platysma ;

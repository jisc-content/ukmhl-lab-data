THE BRAIN. 522 The second temporal sulcus is placed midway between the parallel sulcus and the infero-lateral border of the hemisphere. It is very rare to find it in the form of a continuous cleft. Usually it is broken up into several isolated pieces, placed one behind the other. Its hinder part, which turns upwards into the parietal lobe (Fig. 283, asc.\ and is surrounded by the post-parietal gyrus, lies close to the artificial line of demarcation between the occipital and parietal lobes. By the two temporal sulci the outer surface of the temporal lobe is mapped out into three tiers of horizontal convolutions, which are termed the first, second, and third temporal gyri (Fig. 283, T2 and T^). Tentorial Surface of the Temporal Lobe.—On this surface there is one fissure, termed the occipito-temporal sulcus. The occipito-temporal sulcus (Fig. 285, occ. temp.) lies to the outer side of the collateral fissure and close to the infero-lateral border of the hemisphere. It runs in an antero-posterior direction, and is not confined to the tem- poral lobe, but extends backwards towards the occipital pole. It is usually broken up into two or more separate pieces. The occipito-temporal convolution (Fig. 285) is situated between the collateral fissure and the occipito-temporal sulcus. It extends from the occipital pole behind to the temporal pole in front. The narrow strip of surface on the outer side of the occipito-temporal sulcus is continuous round the infero- lateral margin of the hemisphere with the third temporal convolution on the outer surface of the cerebrum, and may be reckoned as a part of it. The three temporal convolutions and the occipito-temporal convolution run into each other at the temporal pole. The Island of Reil or Insula.—The insula is a triangular field of cerebral cortex which lies on a deeper plane than the general surface of the hemisphere, and is hidden from view by the four opercula which overlap it (p. 506). It is

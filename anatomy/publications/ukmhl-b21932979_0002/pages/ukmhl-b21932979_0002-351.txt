SUBMAXILLARY REGION. 329 Branches of Distribution. I. Slender fiKaments to the mucous membrane of the mouth and gums. 2. A few twigs to the sublingual gland. 3. Branches to the tongue. The lingual branches pierce the substance of the tongue, and then incline upwards to supply the mucous membrane with the conical and fungiform papillae over the anterior two-thirds of this organ. Submaxillary Ganglion.—This is a minute ganglion which will be found lying upon the upper part of the hyo-glossus muscle in the interval between the lingual nerve and the deep part of the submaxillary gland, under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle. In size it is not larger than the head of a large pin, and, when freed from the connective tissue surrounding both it and its branches, it will be seen to be suspended from the lingual nerve by two short branches, which enter its upper border, and are separated by a distinct interval. Of these, the posterior connecting twig is frequently in the form of two or three filaments, which convey to the ganglion its sensory and secretory roots, whilst the anterior connecting branch must be looked upon as a twig given by the ganglion to the lingual nerve. In common with the other ganglia developed in con- nection with the branches of the fifth cranial nerve, this ganglion has three roots—viz. (i) a sensory root from the lingual nerve; (2) a secretory root from the chorda tympani; and (3) a sympathetic root from the plexus around the facial artery. From its lower border several minute twigs proceed, and these are distributed—(i) to the submaxillary gland; (2) to Wharton's duct; and (3) to the mucous membrane of the mouth. The Hypoglossal Nerve has been traced in the dissection of the anterior triangle to the point where it disappears under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle (p. 229). It is now seen passing forwards upon the hyo-glossus niuscle above the

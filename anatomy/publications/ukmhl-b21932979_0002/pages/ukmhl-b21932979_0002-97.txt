75 THORACIC CAVITY. When the auricles are removed from the ventricles, the relative positions of the orifices at the base of the ventri- cular portion of the heart can be studied. The auriculo- ventricular openings lie pos- teriorly and side by side. The aortic opening is placed in front and between them, whilst the pulmonary orifice is situ- ated in front of the aortic open- ing. A wide interval inter- venes between the apertures of the right ventricle: the aortic and left auriculo-ven- tricular orifices, however, lie close together, and their fib- rous rings for a short distance are confluent with each other. In the triangular interval, be- tween the aortic and left auri- culo-ventricular opening, there is a mass of fibro-cartilage which stands in intimate connection with the fibrous rings. Dissection.—To expose the trachea more fully, separate the right and left pulmonary arteries with the knife, and throw each outwards towards the lung with which it is connected. The aortic arch must be drawn aside, and some bronchial glands which occupy the angle between the bronchi removed. Trachea and Bronchi. — The thoracic portion of the trachea, or wind-pipe, traverses the superior mediastinum. It is a wide tube, which is kept constantly patent by a series of cartilaginous rings which are embedded in its walls. Posteriorly these rings are deficient, and in consequence the tube is flattened behind. Its appearance in transverse section may be seen in Fig. 176, p. 65. It begins in the neck opposite the sixth cervical vertebra, where it is con- tinuous with the larynx, and it enters the chest cavity through the thoracic inlet. Here it lies in the superior Fig. 179.—Diagram of the base of the ventricular portion of the heart. P. Pulmonary opening. A. Aortic opening. L. Lefl auriculo-ventricular opening. R.

456 HEAD AND NECK. In pursuing this upward and outward course, the fibres run with different degrees of obHquity. The uppermost fibres are short and nearly horizontal; the intermediate fibres are the longest, and are very oblique j whilst the lowest fibres are almost vertical in their direction. The Arytenoid Muscle consists of two portions,—a super- ficial part, termed the arytenoideus obliquus, and a deeper layer, called the arytenoideus transversus. superior laryngeal nerve epiglottis. cuneiform cartilage. cartilage of San- torini. thyro-epiglottidean muscle, aryteno-epiglotti- dean muscle, arytenoid muscle, thyro-arytenoid nmscle. crico-arj'tenoideus lateralis muscle. e.\ternal laryngeal nerve, crico-arytenoideus posticus muscle, crico-thyroid muscle. recurrent laryngeal nerve. Fig. 267.—Dissection of the laryn.x viewed from behind and the right. The arytenoideiis obliqtius is composed of two bundles of muscular fibres, each of which springs from the posterior aspect of the outer angle of the base of the corresponding arytenoid cartilage (Fig. 267). From these points the two fleshy slips proceed upwards and inwards, and cross each other in the mesial plane like the limbs of the letter X.

THORAX. 78 Dissection.—To open into the posterior mediastinal space it is neces- sary to make a vertical incision through the pericardium, which forms its anterior wall. Carry the knife along the line of the oesophagus, and throw the pericardium outwards. If this be done with care, a fleshy band may, in some cases, be observed crossing the superficial aspect of the thoracic aorta, and extending from the cesophagus to the pleura, which forms the left lateral wall of the posterior mediastinal space. This is the pleuro-asophageal nmscle. In the majority of cases, how- ever, this muscle is only represented by a few slender musculi fasciculi which are difficult to isolate from the areolar tissue in which they lie. Pneumogastric Nerves.—The pneumogastric nerves can now be followed throughout their entire course within the Fig. i8i.—Tracing of a section through the lower part of the posterior mediastinum, where its anterior wall is formed by the diaphragm. thorax. They traverse both the superior and posterior mediastinal spaces, but differ so much in their relations on the two sides of the body that it is best to examine each separately. The left pneumogastric nerve enters the thorax in the in- terval between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, and behind the left innominate vein (Fig. 178, p. 68). It has already been observed crossing the arch of the aorta behind and to the left side of the phrenic nerve and the two superficial cardiac nerves (Fig. 176, p. 65). Here also it has been seen to give off its recurrent laryngeal branch. Leaving

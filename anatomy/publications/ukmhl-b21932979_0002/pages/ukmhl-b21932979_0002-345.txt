323 SUBMAXILLAR V REGION. inwards, and backwards, and present two different modes of insertion. The posterior fibres are inserted into the body of the hyoid bone; these, however, form a comparatively small part of the muscle. The greater number of the fibres are inserted into a median raphe, which extends between the symphysis of the lower jaw and the body of the hyoid bone. The two mylo-hyoid muscles, therefore, in front of Fig. 237.—Dissection of the submaxillary space. the hyoid bone stretch across from one side of the body of the mandible to the other, and constitute a floor for the anterior part of the mouth. This floor is frequently termed the diaphragma oris. The mylo-hyoid muscle is supplied by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior dental nerve. Dissection.—The mylo-hyoid muscle must now be reflected, in order that the parts subjacent to it may be brought into view. As these parts

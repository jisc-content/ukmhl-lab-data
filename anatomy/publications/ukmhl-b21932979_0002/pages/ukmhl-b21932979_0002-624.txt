6oo THE AUDITORY APPARATUS. ing that the fibrous layer is absent), and not so tightly stretched; consequently it receives the name of the mem- brana fiaccida (Schrapnell's membrane). The merabrana tympani is composed of three layers— viz., an outside cuticular layer, an intermediate fibrous lamina, and an inside mucous layer. The handle of the malleus is intimately connected with the fibrous layer, and is covered over by the mucous layer. It draws the mem- brane inwards towards the tympanic cavity so that the outer surface is deeply concave. The deepest point of this con- cavity corresponds with the flattened extremity of the handle of the malleus, and is termed the umbo or umbilicus. Fig. 321.—The right membrana tympani as seen from the outside. (From Merkel.) The plica anterior and the plica posterior are the folds which limit the membrana flaccida in front and behind. The handle of the malleus is seen shining through the membrane. In examining the living ear with a speculum, the surface of the mem- brane appears highly polished, and a cone of light extends downwards and forwards from the tip of the handle of the malleus. A pair of stritx: (Prussak's strice) called the anterior and posterior folds, extend from the processus brevis to the margins of the notch of Rivinus, and thus map out Schrapnell's membrane. The long process of the incus can be faintly seen through the membrana tympani, parallel to and behind the handle of the malleus.

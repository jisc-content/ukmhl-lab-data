SIDE OF THE NECK. 251 vertebral muscles; the recurrent laryftgeal nerve is carried upwards and inwards behind the lower part of the vessel; the inferior thyroid artery crosses behind the carotid sheath about the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. To the outer side of the common carotid artery lie the pneumogastric nerve and the internal jugular vein/ whilst internally, it is in contact with a succession of structures as it proceeds upwards, viz., (i) the trachea and oesophagus, with the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the groove between them; (2) the lateral lobe of the thyroid body, which overlaps the vessel; (3) the larynx and the pharynx. sterno- omo-hyoid. thyroid, sterno-hyoid. anterior jugular vein. vertebral artery and lonjrus retro-pharyngeal plexus of veins. colli. space. Fig. 220.—Transverse section through the neck at the level of the cricoid cartilage. As general rule, the common carotid artery gives off no collateral branches, and its calibre is of nearly equal diameter throughout, except close to its bifurcation, where a slight bulging or dilatation may usually be noticed. ^ On the left side, at the root of the neck, the internal jugular vein is closely applied to the artery—so close is it, indeed, that it may be said to overlap it. On the right side, however, the vein is separated from the artery by a slight interval, through the middle of which the vagus nerve passes down perpendicularly.

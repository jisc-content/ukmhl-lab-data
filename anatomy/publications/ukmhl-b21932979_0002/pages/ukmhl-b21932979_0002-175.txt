DORSAL ASPECT OF THE TRUNK'. 153 muscle. A thick dense fascia is placed over these subjacent parts, and in this we find certain of the cervical nerves and the anastomosis be- tween the arteria princeps cervicis and arteria profunda cervicis. The dissector must specially look for a small twig from the sub-occipital nerve which enters the deep surface of the upper part of the complexus, and for a larger branch to the same muscle from the great occipital Fig. 199.â€”Ligamentum nuchte.

The inner margin of the comple.xus will be seen to be in con- tact with a mesial fibrous partition which separates it from the corre- sponding muscle of the opposite side. This is the ligamentum nuchre. The Ligamentum Nuchse (Fig. 199) is a strong fibrous parti- tion placed in the mesial plane between the muscles on the

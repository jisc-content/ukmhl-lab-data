515 THE CEREBRUM. the external parieto-occipital fissure to an indentation on the infero-lateral border of the hemisphere, termed the prcEoccipital jtotch, may be regarded as furnishing a posterior limitation. The prseoccipital notch is, as a rule, only visible in brains that have been hardened in situ. It is produced by a slight wrinkle or fold of the dura mater on the deep aspect of the parieto-mastoid suture, and in relation to the portion of the lateral venous sinus which lies in this locality. The notch is placed on the infero-lateral border of the hemisphere, about one inch and a-half in front of the occipital pole. Mesial Surface of the Parietal Lobe—Prsecuneus.—On the mesial surface of the hemisphere the parietal lobe is represented by the prczcuneus or quadrate lobule. This district, which is somewhat quadrilateral in form, lies between the upturned hinder end of the calloso-marginal fissure and the internal parieto-occipital fissure. Below it is imperfectly separated from the limbic lobe by a somewhat variable sulcus called the post-litnbic sulcus (Fig. 284). External Surface of the Parietal Lobe.—The gyri and sulci on the outer surface of the parietal lobe are the following :— [Sulcus postcentralis Gyri. 'Ascending parietal or postcentral.

The Intraparietal Sulcus of Turner.—This is a composite sulcus built up out of four originally distinct factors. Two of these, termed the sulcus postcentralis inferior and the sulcus postcentralis superior, take a more or less vertical ■course across the hemisphere, and are most frequently

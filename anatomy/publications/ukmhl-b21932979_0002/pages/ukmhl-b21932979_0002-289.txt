DISSECTION OF THE FACE. 267 (Fig. 223). It is from the thin anterior margin towards its upper part that the duct of the gland emerges, and frequently a small detached lobule of gland substance will be observed lying upon the masseter in relation to the upper aspect of the duct (Fig. 222). This is termed the socia parotidis. lev. lab. sup. antrum of Highmore. zygomaticus major. buccinator muscle. temporal muscle, tonsil. mandibular vessels and nerve. pharjMi.v. stylo-pharyngeus. .slylo-glossus. int. carotid, sympathetic. Fig. 223.â€”Transverse section through the head at the level of the hard palate. It shows very well the relations of the parotid gland, &c. 1. Temporo-maxillary vein. 2. Sterno-mastoid muscle. 3. Digastric (posterior belly). 4. Spinal accessory nerve. 5. Internal jugular vein. 6. Stylo-liyoid. 7. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 8. Vagus and hypoglossal nerves. The superficial or external surface of the parotid is slightly convex, and is covered by the dense parotid fascia which the dissector has already observed to be a prolongation upwards into the face of a portion of the deep cervical fascia (p. 196).

445 THE CHORDA TYMPANI. The fourth stage is vertical, and arclies downwards behind the pyramid to gain the stylo-mastoid foramen. The brattches which spring from the facial nerve during its passage through the temporal bone are :â€” 1. The great superficial petrosal nerve, ^ 2. Communicating twig to tympanic branch of the ' from geniculate glosso-pharyngeal, I ganglion. 3. External superficial petrosal nerve, j 4. Nerve to stapedius. 5. Chorda tympani. 6. Communicating twigs to the auricular branch of vagus. The great superficial petrosal ?ierve has already been examined (p. 359). Its origin from the geniculate ganglion of the facial can now be established by breaking through the roof of the hiatus Fallopii with the chisel. The communicating branch to the tympanic nerve arises from the geniculate ganglion, and its union with the tympanic forms the small superficial petrosal nerve (p. 342, Fig. 240). The external superficial petrosal nerve is not always present. It joins the sympathetic plexus which accompanies the middle meningeal artery (p. 359). The nerve to the stapedius muscle arises from the facial as it arches downwards behind the pyramid. It enters the base of the pyramid and thus reaches the stapedius muscle. The communicating twigs to the auricular branch of the vagus arise a short distance above the stylo-mastoid foramen (P- 344)- The Chorda Tympani, which is the pars intermedia set free from the facial nerve, is the largest branch which is given off by the facial during its passage through the aqueduct of Fallopius. It takes origin a short distance above the stylo- mastoid foramen, and arching upwards and forwards in a narrow canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone (iter chordae posterius) it appears in the tympanum below the base of the pyramid, and close to the posterior margin of membrana tympani. The bony tunnel which it occupies

HEAD AND NECK. 234 The scalenus ajiticus (scalenus anterior) is a well-defined muscle which is separated from the scalenus medius by the brachial nerves and the subclavian artery. It arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of four cervical vertebree—viz., the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth—and, taper- ing somewhat as it descends, is inserted into the scalene tubercle on the inner margin of the first rib, and also into the upper surface of the same bone between the two sub- clavian grooves. The scalenus medius is a more powerful muscle than the preceding. It springs from the posterior tubercles of all the cervical transverse processes (with the exception, in some cases, of the first), and it is inserted into a rough oval elevation which marks the upper surface of the first rib between the tubercle and the groove for the subclavian artery. The scalenus posticus (scalenus posterior) is generally in- separable at its origin from the scalenus medius. It is the smallest of the three, and springs by two or three slips from the transverse processes of a corresponding number of the lower cervical vertebrae in common with the scalenus medius. It is inserted into the upper border of the second rib, immediately in front of the insertion of the levator costae. Subclavian Artery (arteria subclavia).—The subclavian artery is the first subdivision of the great vessel which carries blood for the supply of the upper limb. It arises differently on the two sides of the body. On the 7-ight side it takes origin behind the sterno-clavicular articulation by the bifurcation of the innominate artery. On the left side it springs, within the cavity of the thorax, from the aortic arch. In both cases it takes an arched course outwards across the root of the neck, behind the scalenus anticus muscle and above the pleura. At the outer border of the first rib it enters the axilla and receives the name of axillary artery.

HEAD AND NECK. 302 Dissection.—The cartilaginous part of the nose should now be examined by stripping off the compressor naris muscle and the remains of the integument. The Nasal Cartilages.—In addition to the septal cartilage which will be more appropriately studied in the dissection of the nasal chambers, two cartilaginous plates will be found upon each side. These are :— 1. The upper lateral cartilage. 2. The cartilage of the aperture. The upper lateral cartilage is a triangular plate which by its posterior margin is attached to the lower border of the nasal bone and the upper part of the sharp margin of the Fig. 233.—Cartilages of the nose.

In the mesial plane this cartilage becomes continuous with its fellow of the opposite side, and also with the subjacent anterior border of the septal cartilage of the nose. Below, there is a slight interval between the two lateral cartilages, in which is seen the margin of the nasal septal cartilage. The inferior border of the lateral cartilage is connected with the outer part of the cartilage of the aperture by some dense fibrous tissue.

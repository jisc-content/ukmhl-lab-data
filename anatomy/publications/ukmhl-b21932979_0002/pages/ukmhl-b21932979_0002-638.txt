THE EYEBALL. 6i4 essential, however, that the dissector should always, complete his study of the organ by the examination of a fresh human eyeball obtained from the post mortem room. In point of size and also in other particulars the eyeball of the pig more closely resembles the human eyeball, but it is perhaps better that the student should begin with the eyeball of the ox, seeing that the dissection can be more easily carried out. We shall suppose then that the dissector has provided himself with six eyeballs obtained from oxen. His first duty is to remove from these the conjunctiva, capsule of Tenon, ocular muscles, and fat, which adhere to them. Pinching up with the forceps the conjunctiva and capsule of Tenon close to the corneal margin, he should snip through suspensory ligament of lens. macula.

It is now easy to strip all the soft parts from the surface of the sclerotic coat, working steadily backwards towards the entrance of the optic nerve. A little behind the equator of the eyeball the venre vorticosse will be noticed issuing at wide intervals from the sclerotic coat, and on approaching the posterior aspect of the eyeball the posterior ciliary arteries and the ciliary nerves will be seen piercing the same coat around the entrance of the optic nerve. Before beginning the actual dissection of the eyeball, it is important that the student should obtain a general conception of the parts which compose it. This can best be done by selecting two of the specimens

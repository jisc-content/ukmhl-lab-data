THE EYEBALL. 620 Ciliary Muscle.—^This is composed of involuntary mus- cular tissue, but the arrangement of its fibres can only be seen when thin sections of the eyeball are examined under the microscope. The fibres are then seen to be disposed in two groups, viz., a radiating and a circular. The radiatmg fibres arise from the deep aspect of the sclerotic coat close to the margin of the cornea. Yrora this they radiate backwards in a meridional direction, and gain Fig. 333.—Dissection of the eyeball showing the vascu- lar tunic and the distribution of the ciliary nerves and vessels. insertion into the choroid coat in the region of the ciliary processes. The cirmlar fibres consist of two or three bundles placed upon the deep aspect of the radiating portion of the muscle. They form a muscular ring around the circumference of the iris. Dissection.—To obtain a view of the ciliary processes, a coronal section should be made with the scissors through an eyeball a short distance in front of the equator. The portion of the vitreous body which occupies the anterior segment of the eyeball should be carefully removed. When this is done, the deep aspect of the ciliary processes will be seen as they

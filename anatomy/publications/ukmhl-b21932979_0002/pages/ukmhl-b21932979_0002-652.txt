THE EYEBALL. 628 into the intervals between the ciliary processes, whilst the ciliary processes in their turn lie in the depressions between the wrinkles of the zonula. When the eye is fresh, these opposing parts are closely adherent. The zonula of Zinn is strengthened by radially directed meridional elastic fibres, and after the delicate membrane which lines the fossa patellaris is given off from its deep surface, it extends forwards as a distinct layer, and is attached to the anterior surface of the capsule of the lens a short distance beyond the margin of that body. In this manner the suspensory ligament of the le?ts is formed. But this is not the only attachment of the suspensory ligament. Some scattered fibres are attached to the circumference or equator of the lens (equatorial fibres), whilst others are fixed to its posterior surface close to its margin (post-equatorial fibres). In this way the crystalline lens is firmly held in its place in the fossa patellaris. Further, the degree of tension of its suspensory ligament is influenced by the radiating fibres of the ciliary muscle, which by their contraction pull upon the ciliary processes, and produce relaxation of the zonule of Zinn. Canal of Petit.—This is a circular lymph space, which surrounds the circumference of the lens. It is bounded in front by the suspensory ligament, and behind by the hyaloid membrane, enclosing the vitreous body. It is filled with a watery fluid. By introducing the point of a fine blow-pipe into the canal of Petit through the suspensory ligament, it can be partially, or, perhaps, com- pletely, inflated with air. It then presents a sacculated appearance. Dissection.—The crystalline lens may be removed by snipping through the suspensory ligament with scissors. Crystalline Lens.—The crystalline lens is a biconvex, solid, and transparent structure, which lies behind the iris, and in front of the vitreous body. It is enclosed within a

THE CEREBRUM. SSI fold of pia mater! In the removal of the velum inter- positum this thin epithelial roof has been torn away. The third ventricle communicates freely with the lateral ventricles, and also with the fourth ventricle. The aqueduct of Sylvius, a narrow channel which tunnels the mesen- cephalon, brings it into communication with the fourth ventricle. The opening of this aqueduct will be seen at the posterior part of the floor of the ventricle, immediately below the posterior commissure. The foramina of Monro bring it into communication with the two lateral ventricles. The latter apertures are placed at the upper and fore parts of the lateral walls, and lead outwards and slightly upwards between Fig. 300.â€”Diagrammatic outline of the third ventricle as viewed from the side. the most prominent parts of the anterior pillars of the fornix, and the anterior tubercles of the optic thalami. They are just large enough to admit a crowquill, and through these passages the epithelial lining of the three ventricles becomes continuous. The outline of the third ventricle when viewed from the side in a mesial section through the brain (Fig. 300), or as it is exhibited in a plaster cast of the ventricular system of the brain, is seen to be very- irregular. It presents several diverticula or recesses. Thus, in the fore part of the floor there is a deep funnel-shaped pit or recess leading down through the tuber cinereum into the infundibulum of the pituitary body. Another recess leads forwards immediately in front of this, above the optic chiasma. Posteriorly two additional recesses are present. One, FORAMEN OF MONRO. OPTIC CHIASMA

SIDE OF THE NECK. 221 artery gives off its tonsillitic and ascending palatine branches, whilst its sjihmental and submaxillary branches arise within the gland. The submental artery runs forwards towards the chin. The mylo-hyoid nerve and artery will be seen passing forwards and downwards upon the mylo-hyoid muscle under cover of the submaxillary gland. The twigs of the nerve to the muscle of the same name and to the anterior belly of the digastric should be followed out. Only a very small part of the hypoglossal nerve is seen in this space. It lies upon the hyoglossus muscle immediately above the hyoid bone, and disappears under cover of the posterior border of the mylo-hyoid muscle. Numerous small lytnphatic glands lie under shelter of the base of the lower jaw. The external carotid artery enters the posterior part of the digastric triangle. Here it lies under cover of the lower part of the parotid gland, and gives off its posterior auricular branch, which passes upwards and backwards along the upper border of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Middle Line of the Neck.—Before the parts are further disturbed the dissector should examine the structures which occupy the middle line of the neck—a region, more especially in its lower part, of the highest importance and interest to the surgeon. The middle line of the neck may be divided by means of the hyoid bone into an upper supra-hyoid and a lower infra-hyoid portion. In the supra-hyoid part are found structures which are concerned in the construction of the floor of the mouth. The student has already noticed that the fatty superficial fascia is more fully developed here than elsewhere in the neck, and that the anterior margins of the two platysma muscles meet in the mesial plane about half-an-inch or so below the chin. Above this point their fibres decussate. In the present condition of parts the two anterior bellies of the digastric muscles are observed attached to the mandible

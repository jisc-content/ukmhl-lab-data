467 THE LARYNX. The mesial ridge itself gives origin to the fibres which form the anterior longitudinal muscular band of the oesophagus. In front of the posterior lamina, the ring of the cricoid cartilage is completed by an anterior arch. The lower border of this is horizontal, and is connected to the first tracheal ring by membrane. The arch is narrow in front, and is attached to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage by the middle portion of the crico-thyroid membrane. Behind this the upper border rapidly ascends. Upon the posterior part of the lateral surface of the cricoid cartilage there is a circular, slightly elevated, convex facet, which looks outwards and upwards for articulation with the in- ferior cornu of the thyroid car- tilage. Internally the cricoid cartilage is lined by mucous membrane. Inferiorly the lumen is circular, but above it is elliptical. Cartilages of Santorini (coriiiacla laryngis).—Before proceeding to the study of the arytenoid cartilages the dissector should examine the cartilages of Santorini and the manner in which they are held in position. They are two minute pyramidal nodules of yellow elastic cartilage which are placed on the summits of the arytenoid cartilages, and are directed backwards and inwards. Each cartilage of Santorini is enclosed within the corresponding aryteno- epiglottidean fold of mucous membrane, and is joined to the apex of the arytenoid cartilage by a joint which may either partake of the nature of diarthrosis or synchondrosis. The tips of the two cornicula laryngis are connected to Fig. 270.—Posterior view of the cricoid and arytenoid carti- lages. (From LuscHKA.) 1. Posterior lamina of cricoid cartilage. 2.

3 THORACIC WALL. phragm, a muscular partition which intervenes between the cavity of the chest above and the cavity of the abdo- men below. It is highly vaulted or dome-shaped, and projects upwards so as to form a convex floor for the thorax, and a concave roof for the abdomen. The upward projection of the diaphragm greatly diminishes the vertical depth of the thoracic cavity. But the diaphragm does not form an unbroken parti- tion. It presents three large openings, by means of which structures pass to and from the thorax, viz.—(i) for the aorta, thoracic duct, and vena azygos major; (2) for the oesophagus and pneumogastric nerves; (3) for the inferior vena cava. Besides these there are other smaller apertures which will be mentioned later on. THORACIC WALL. Tzuo days at least should be devoted to the dissection of the thoracic wall. In addition to the osseous and cartilaginous framework, the walls of the chest are built up partly by muscles, and partly by membranes, and in connection with these there are numerous nerves and blood vessels.

Dissection.—Portions of certain of the muscles of the upper limb and of the abdominal wall will be noticed attached to the thoracic wall. From before backwards the dissector will meet with thepedoralis major, the pedoralis minor, and the serratus niagmis, whilst towards the lower margin of the chest he will recognise the rectus abdominis in front, and

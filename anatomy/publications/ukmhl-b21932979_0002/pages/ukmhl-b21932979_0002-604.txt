THE BRAIN. the cerebellum, they converge as they proceed upwards, and finally they disappear under the inferior quadrigeminal bodies. The thin lamina which is stretched across between them is the valve of Vieussens, or the superior medullary velum. It is continuous below with the white core of the cere- bellum, and it forms the roof of the upper part of the fourth ventricle. From its dorsal surface, close to the inferior quadrigeminal body, the small trochlear nerves emerge. Certain of the fissures which traverse the surface of the cerebellum, deeper and longer than the others, map out districts which are termed lobes. The most conspicuous of all these clefts is the great horizontal fissure. Tncisiira semilunaris Lohilus centralis Fig. 313.—Upper surface of the cerebellum. (From SCHWAI.BE.) Great Horizontal Fissure of the Cerebellum.—The great horizontal fissure begins in front, and passes round the circumference of the cerebellum, cutting deeply into its outer and posterior margins. In front, its lips diverge from each other so as to enclose the large middle peduncle, where it passes into the interior of the cerebellum. This fissure divides the organ into an upper and a lower part, which may be studied separately. Lobes on the Upper Surface of the Cerebellum.—When examined from before backwards, the vermis superior

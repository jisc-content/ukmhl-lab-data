S66 THE BRAIN. THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN WHICH LIE IN THE POSTERIOR CRANIAL FOSSA. The parts which lie below the tentorium cerebelli in the posterior cranial fossa are the 7nedulla oblofigata, the pons Varolii, and the cerebellum. These are grouped around the fourth ventricle of the brain—a cavity which communi- cates below with the central canal of the spinal cord, and above with the aqueduct of Sylvius. Through the latter it establishes a connection with the third ventricle of the brain. Medulla Oblongata.—This is the continuation of the spinal cord into the brain. It is not more than one inch in length, and may be reckoned as beginning at the level of the foramen magnum. From this it proceeds upwards in a very nearly vertical direction, and ends at the lower border of the pons Varolii. At first its girth is similar to that of the cord, but it rapidly expands as it approaches the pons, and con- sequently it presents a more or less conical appearance. Its anterior surface lies behind the groove on the basilar portion of the occipital bone, whilst its posterior aspect is sunk into the vallecula of the cerebellum. The medulla oblongata is a bilateral structure, and this is evident even by an inspection of its exterior. The antero- median and postero-median grooves on the surface of the spinal cord are prolonged upwards on the anterior and posterior faces of the medulla. The ufitero-viedian groove, as it passes from the cord on to the medulla, is interrupted at the level of the foramen mag- num by several strands of fibres which cross the mesial plane from one side to the other. This inter-crossing is termed the decussation of the pyramids. Above this level the furrow is carried upwards without interruption to the lower border of the pons. Here it expands slightly, and ends in a blind pit, termed the fot-amen ccecum of Vicq d'Azyr. The postero-median fissure is only carried up for half the length of the medulla. At this point the central canal of

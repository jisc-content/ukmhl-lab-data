48o THE BRAIN. the hinder portions of the cerebral hemispheres. It can be easily recognised on account of the closely-set, curved and parallel fissures which traverse its surface. Above the medulla, and in direct connection with it, is a prominent white elevation called the p07is Varolii. The basilar artery extends upwards in a mesial groove on its surface. Im- mediately in front of the pons Varolii there is a deep hollow or recess. This is bounded behind by the pons, on either side by the projecting temporal lobes of the cerebrum, and in front by the orbital portions of the frontal lobes of the cerebrum. At the present stage of the ex- amination of the brain, the bottom of this hollow is hidden from view by the arachnoid mater, which stretches over it like a veil; but if the pituitary body has been removed with the brain it will be seen within its limits. Passing out from either side of the fore part of this recess will be seen the deep Sylvian fissure, which intervenes between the pointed and projecting extremity of the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe of the cerebrum, whilst in the middle line in front the great longitudinal fissure will be observed to separate the frontal portions of the cerebral hemispheres. On either side of the great longitudinal fissure, and separated from it by a narrow gyrus, the olfactory peduncle and bulb may be recognised. MEMBRANES AND BLOOD VESSELS OF THE BRAIN. Arachnoid Mater.â€”This forms the intermediate covering of the brain. Placed between the dura mater and the pia mater it is directly continuous with the arachnoidea of the spinal cord. It is an exceedingly thin and delicate mem- brane, which can best be seen on the base of the brain, as in this locality it is not so closely applied to the pia mater as elsewhere. Unlike the pia mater, it does not (except in the case of the great longitudinal and the Sylvian fissures)

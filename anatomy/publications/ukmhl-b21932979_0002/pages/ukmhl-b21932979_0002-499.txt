THE TONGUE. 477 aspect of the tongue, and decussate with the fibres of the stratum transversum. Nerves and Vessels of the Tongue.—The nerves of the tongue are—(i) the glosso-pharyngeal; (2) the Ungual; (3) the hypoglossal; and (4) a few twigs from the internal laryngeal. These should be traced on the left side of the tongue, where the mucous membrane is still in position. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve has been traced up to the point where it disappears under cover of the hyo-glossus muscle. Here it di- vides into two branches. The smaller of these extends forwards upon the side of the tongue, and may be traced as far as a point midway between the root and the tip. The larger branch turns upwards and is distributed to the mucous membrane which invests the pos- terior third of the dor- sum linguEe. It gives twigs to the circum- vallate papilte, and some fine filaments may be followed to the anterior surface of the epiglottis. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve is the principal nerve of taste. The lingual and hypoglossal nerves are described in pages 328 and 329, and their terminal branches should now be traced as far as it is possible to do so. The internal laryngeal tterve gives a few delicate fila- ments to the glosso-epiglottidean folds and the mucous membrane of the root of the tongue. The ranine artery should be followed to the tip of the Fig. 274.—Transverse section through the tongue. (From Aeby.) a. Genio-glossus. b. Hyo-glossus. c. Stylo-glossus. d. Stratum transversum. e.

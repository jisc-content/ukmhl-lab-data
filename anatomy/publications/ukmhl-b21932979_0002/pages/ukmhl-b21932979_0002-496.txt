474 HEAD AND NECK. Intrinsic Muscles, 1. Superficial lingual. 2. Inferior lingual. 3. Vertical. 4. Transverse. The extrinsic muscles take origin from parts outside the tongue, and thus are not only capable of giving rise to changes in the form of the organ, but also of producing changes in its position. The intrinsic muscles, which are placed entirely withm the substance of the tongue, are, for posterior digasi anterior belly of digastric, mylo-hyoid. genio-hyoid. Fig. 271.â€”Muscles of the tongue. (From Gegenbaur.) the most part, only capable of giving rise to alterations in its form. With the exception of the chondro-glossus, the extrinsic muscles have already been studied, but the dissector should take this opportunity of examining more fully their insertions, and the manner in which their fibres are related to each other, and to those of the intrinsic muscles. For this purpose, carefully reflect the mucous membrane from the right half of the tongue, and follow the muscles into that side of the organ. At the same time the lingual nerves and the ranine artery should be pre- served. On the under surface of the tongue near the tip, the removal of

REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN. 119 through its upper wall from behind forwards (Fig. 189). It begins in front at the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, where it not unfrequently communicates with the veins in the nasal cavity through the foramen csecum, and it extends backwards, grooving the cranial vault in the middle line, to the internal occipital protuberance (Figs. 190 and 192). Its lumen, which is triangular in form, is very small in front, but expands greatly as it is followed backwards. Fig. 191.â€”The dura mater. (Luschk.-v.) 2. The oval aperture between anterior border of tentorium and dorsum sells. 3. Falx cerebri. 4. Tentorium. 5. Anterior concave margin of tentorium. 6. Vein of Galen entering the straight sinus. The mouths of the superior cerebral veins are observed opening into it (Fig. 189). These veins pour their blood into it in a direction contrary to that in which the blood flows within the channel. The terminal portions of the veins are directed from behind forwards, whilst the blood in the sinus flows from before backwards. The channel is crossed at its inferior angle by a number of minute bands. These receive the name of chorda Willisii.

The inferior lingual muscle (iinguahs inferior) is a rounded fleshy belly which is placed upon the inferior aspect of the tongue. Behind, it lies in the interval between the hyo- glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus and shows an attachment to the hyoid bone ; in front, it is prolonged to the apex of the tongue between the inner border of the stylo-glossus and the genio-hyo-glossus ; with the former it is more or less blended.

The fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus ascend through the stratum transversum and break it up into numerous lamellae (Fig. 273 d). It is joined by the fibres of the palato-glossus (Henle) (Fig. 272). The vertical muscular fibres (stratum perpendiculare) ex- tend in a curved direction from the dorsum to the under

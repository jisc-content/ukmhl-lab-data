HEAD AND NECK. In passing to the surface it pierces the complexus and trapezius. To the former it gives several twigs. The dis- tribution of this nerve on the occiput has already been noticed (p. 109). The internal branch of the third nerve likewise "Sends an offset to the occipital portion of the scalp (p. 13S). The internal branches of the lower three posterior divisions of the cervical nerves resemble the preceding, in so far that they take a course inwards towards the spinous processes. They differ from them, however, in running under cover of the semispinalis muscle, and in being, as a rule, entirely expended in the supply of muscles. Dorsal Region.â€”The posterior primary divisions of the dorsal nerves make their appearance in the intervals between the transverse processes. The external branches proceed outwards under cover of the middle column of the erector spinse muscle, and appear in the interval between the longis- simus dorsi on the one hand, and the ilio-costalis and accessorius on the other. The tipper six or seveji of these nerves are exhausted in the supply of the middle and outer columns of the erector spinse, and the levatores costarum ; the lower five or six, however, are considerably larger, and contain both motor and sensory fibres. After giving up their motor fibres to the same muscles, they become superficial, by piercing the serratus posticus inferior, and the latissimus dorsi, in a line with the angles of the ribs.^ The internal branches are also distributed differently in the upper and lower portions of the dorsal region. The lozver five or six are very small, and end in the multifidus spinae. The upper six or seven pass inwards between the multifidus and semispinalis, and after supplying the muscles between which they are situated, they are directed back- wards, and become superficial. In passing towards the 1 The cutaneous distribution of these nerves has already been examined by the dissector of the upper limb.

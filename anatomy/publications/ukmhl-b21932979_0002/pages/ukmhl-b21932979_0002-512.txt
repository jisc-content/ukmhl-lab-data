THE BRAIN. 49° backwards to join the posterior cerebral between its postero- mesial and postero-lateral groups of basal twigs. The anterior choroidal artery (arteria choroidea) enters the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, and passes into the choroid plexus in that cavity (Fig. 278). The anterior cerebral artery (arteria cerebri anterior) in the first instance takes a horizontal course inwards and for- wards (Fig, 278). It passes above the optic nerve and in front of the optic chiasma, and finally reaches the hinder end of that part of the great longitudinal fissure which separates the frontal lobes of the cerebrum. Here it lies close to its Fig. 279.—The vessels supplying the cortex on the inner surface of the cerebrum. fellow of the opposite side, and the two vessels are con- nected by a short transverse trunk of communication, termed the anterior communicating artery (arteria communicans anterior). The anterior cerebral artery now enters the great longitudinal fissure, and is carried forwards and upwards on the inner surface of the frontal lobe towards the genu or anterior extremity of the corpus callosum (Fig. 279). Round this it turns, and it is then continued backwards on the upper surface of the corpus callosum. Very much reduced in size, it gives off its terminal branch (termed the artery of the

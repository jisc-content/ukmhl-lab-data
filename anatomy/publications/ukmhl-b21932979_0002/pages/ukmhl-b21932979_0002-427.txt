Dissection.—The superior constrictor j)osses.ses a somewhat compli- cated origin, and to bring this fully into view, it will be necessary to cut through the internal pterygoid muscle about its middle, and turn the upper and lower portions aside. In doing this, be careful of the small tensor palati muscle which lies immediately subjacent to the internal pterygoid.

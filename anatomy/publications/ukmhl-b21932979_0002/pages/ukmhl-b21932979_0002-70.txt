48 THORAX. and receiving close to the heart a considerable reinforce- ment from the deep cardiac plexus, they form the right coronary plexus which comes into relation with the corre- sponding artery. The left coronary plexus which accom- panies the artery of the same name is derived from the deep cardiac plexus. The nerves do not slavishly follow the arteries, they soon leave the vessels, and are ultimately lost in the substance of the heart. Here and there ganglia are developed in connec- tion with them. Dissection.—The cham - bers of the heart should now be opened in the order in which the blood flows through them. Be- gin with the right auricle, and, to bring it fully into view, draw the heart well over to the left side of the body. Fig. i6g shows the direction in which the incisions through its walls must be made. Two cuts are required—(i) A vertical incision from the point at which the superior vena cava enters the auricle to the point of entrance of Fig. 169.—Diagram to show the manner in which the right auricle should be opened. The draw- ing is taken from an injected heart in the Edinburgh University. The dotted line.s give the directions in which the two incisions should be made, a, Superior vena cava; b, Left innominate vein ; c, Right innominate vein ; d, Vena azj'gos major; e. One of the pulmonary veins; /, Inferior vena cava; Aortic arch ; h, Pulmonary artery. the inferior vena cava. In making this incision, care must be taken not to injure the Eustachian valve—a fold of endocardium placed in front of the mouth of the inferior vena cava. (2) An oblique incision carried from about the middle of the first cut to the tip of the auricular appendix. The dark venous blood should now be washed away from the interior of the auricle with a sponge.

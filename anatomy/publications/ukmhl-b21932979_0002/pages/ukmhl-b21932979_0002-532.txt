THE BRAIN. Boundaries of the Frontal Lobe.—The frontal is the largest of the cerebral lobes. On the outer surface of the hemisphere it is bounded behind by the fissure of Rolando, and below, by the posterior horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. On the mesial face it is limited by the calloso- marginal fissure, whilst on the inferior surface of the hemi- sphere the stem of the fissure of Sylvius forms its posterior boundary. External Surface of the Frontal Lobe.—On the outer surface of the frontal lobe the following sulci and gyri may be recognised :— Sulci < Gyri' Ascending frontal (or an- terior central).

The inferior prcecentral furrow (Fig. 283, p.c.i.) consists of a vertical and a horizontal part, and, when present in a well-marked form, it presents a figure like the letter X or F. The vertical portion lies in front of the lower part of the fissure of Rolando, whilst the horizontal portion extends obliquely forwards and upwards into the middle frontal con- volution. The superior pracentral furroiv (Fig. 283, p.c.s.) is a short vertical sulcus which lies at a higher level than the inferior prtecentral furrow, in front of the upper part of the fissure of Rolando. It is almost invariably connected with the hinder end of the superior frontal sulcus. The ascending frontal coftvolution (gyrus centralis anterior) is a long continuous gyrus which is limited in front by the two prsecentral furrows, and behind, by the fissure of Rolando. It extends obliquely across the hemisphere, from

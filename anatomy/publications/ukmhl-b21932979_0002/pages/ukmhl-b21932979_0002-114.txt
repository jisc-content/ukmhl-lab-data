92 THORAX. to the spinal cord and its membranes. In each space, the intercostal artery proceeds outwards, first lying between the posterior intercostal membrane and the pleura, and afterwards between the two muscular strata. Each artery is accompanied by a nerve and a vein. The vein usually occupies the highest level, the nerve the loivest level, whilst the artery is intermediate. The distribution of these vessels in the thoracic parietes has already been studied {vide p. 7). The position of the intercostal artery in the intercostal space is a matter of some surgical importance. At first it crosses the intercostal space obliquely, so as to gain the shelter of the subcostal groove of the rib which bounds the space above. It attains this position near the angle of the rib, and as it proceeds forwards the groove affords it a very efficient protection against wounds from without. The intercostal arteries which supply the tivo highest intercostal spaces, are derived from the superior i7ite7-costal branch of the subclavian artery. The superior intercostal artery descends upon the necks of the first two ribs, and external to the gangliated cord. It anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal artery, and sends outwards two vessels for the two highest spaces. Each of these, in turn, gives off a dorsal branch similar to the dorsal branches of the aortic intercostal arteries. The intercostal nerves pass outwards in company with the arteries. The communicating twigs which pass between these nerves and the sympathetic ganglia have already been noted. Each nerve lies at a lower level than the corre- sponding artery, and is at first placed between the posterior intercostal membrane and the pleura, and then between the two muscular strata. The further course of these nerves is described at p. 5. The first dorsal nerve will be found passing upwards over the neck of the first rib to join the brachial plexus. It gives a small branch to the first intercostal space, but this

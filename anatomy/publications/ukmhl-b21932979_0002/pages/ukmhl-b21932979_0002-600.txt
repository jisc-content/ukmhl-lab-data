THE BRAIN. 576 white matter and open towards the mesial plane. It is in reality a lamina arranged in a purse-like manner with its open mouth directed towards the raphe. The fibres which enter through its mouth constitute the olivary peduncle. The accessory olivary nuclei are two band-like laminse of grey matter, which are respectively placed on the dorsal and mesial aspects of the main nucleus. When seen in transverse section each of these nuclei presents a rod-like appearance (Fig. 312, 0^ and o'.) Behind, or deeper than, the olive on the one hand, and the pyramid on the other, is the forTnatio reticularis of the medulla. It forms a large 71.x t Fig. 312.—Section through the medulla oblongata at the leve of the middle part of the olive.

THE AUDITORY APPARATUS. 6o4 The Tympanic Plexus has also been previously described on p. 341. The Eustachian Tube is the passage which brings the tympanic cavity into communication with the pharynx and through which air reaches the tympanic cavity and the mastoidal cells. It consists of an osseous and a cartilaginous portion. The osseous portion is about half-an-inch in length. It is widest at its entrance into the tympanum, and narrowest carotid canal, cochlea. tendon of stape- dius. facial nerve, lateral sinus.

Dissection.—A good deal of the anatomy of the internal ear may be learned by chiselling away the surrounding bone from the harder walls of the different cavities which form the osseous labyrinth. When this is being done the bone must be held in a vice. Various sections should also be made through the macerated bone. Some of the more essential of these will lie described later on. Internal Ear or Labyrinth.—The labyrinth consists of an intricate system of cavities in the petrous part of the temporal

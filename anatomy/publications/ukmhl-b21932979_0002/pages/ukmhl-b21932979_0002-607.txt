LOB us UVULAE. 583 tonsil or amygdala, a rounded lobule, which bounds the vallecula on the inner side of the biventral lobule; (4) the slender lobule (lobulus gracilis), a narrow crescentic strip of cerebellar surface which is situated behind the biventral lobule; (5) the postero-inferior lobule placed behind the slender lobule, and bounding the great horizontal fissure below. These lobules of the hemispheres, with the corresponding portions of the vermis inferior, constitute the lobes on the under aspect of the cerebellum. Lobus Noduli.—The lobus noduli comprises the nodule and the flocculus with an exceedingly delicate connecting lamina of white matter, termed the inferior medullary velum. The velum cannot 1)e properly seen at present, luit it will be e.xposed at a later stage of the dissection. Lobus Uvulae.—The uvula is a triangular elevation placed between the two tonsils. It is connected across the sulcus valleculse with each tonsil by a low-lying ridge of grey matter scored by a few shallow furrows, and in consequence termed the furroived band. The two tonsils and the uvula form the lobus uvula;. Fig. 314.—Lower surface of the cerebellum. (From SCHVVALBE.) N. Nodule. U. Uvula. P. Pyramid.

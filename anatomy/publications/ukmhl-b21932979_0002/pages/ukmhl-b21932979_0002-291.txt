269 DISSECTION OF THE FACE. it opens into the mouth by a minute orifice placed on the summit of a small papilla. In length, the duct measures about two inches, and its course may be marked out on the surface of the cheek by drawing a line from the lower part of the external auditory meatus of the auricle to a point mid- way between the nostrils and the margin of the red part of the Hp. The dissector should now open the duct, and pass a fine probe through it into the mouth. The calibre of the tube will then be observed to be greatly reduced at its open- ing upon the inner aspect of the cheek. Evert the cheek, and examine this orifice. Vessels and Nerves which traverse the Parotid.—By the removal of the gland, the vessels and nerves which traverse the gland are brought into view. These are :— 1. External carotid artery, J Superficial temporal. dividing into . . I. Internal maxillarj'. 2. Transverse facial artery. 3. Temporo-maxillary vein. 4. Facial nerve, or the seventh cranial nerve. 5. Communicating twigs from the great auricular and auriculo-temporal nerves to the facial nerve. The external carotid (arteria carotis externa), as it ascends in the substance of the gland, lies nearer its deep than its superficial surface. In fact, in the lower part of its parotid stage the artery is not placed within the gland, but merely in a groove on its deep surface, and slightly under shelter of the posterior border of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw. Note that the facial nerve crosses superficial to it, and that opposite the neck of the lower jaw it divides into the superficial temporal and the internal maxillary arteries. The temporo-maxillary vein is formed by the union of the superficial temporal and internal maxillary veins behind the neck of the lower jaw. It descends in the substance of the parotid superficial to the external carotid artery. At the lower border of the gland it divides into an anterior and

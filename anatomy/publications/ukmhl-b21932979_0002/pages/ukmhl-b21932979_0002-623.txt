MEMBRANA TYMPANI. 599 almost surrounds the tendon of the tensor tympani, and forms a pulley upon which the tendon plays. Below the hinder end of the promontory is the fenestra rotunda, an aperture which, in the macerated bone, leads into the cavity of the cochlea, but which in the recent state, is closed by a membrane which is stretched across it, and receives the name of the secondary membrane of the tympanuin. The outer wall of the tympanic cavity is formed for the most part by the membrana tympani. Membrana Tympani.— The membrana tympani is an elliptical disc of mem- brane which is stretched across the bottom of the meatus auditorius externus, so as to form the greater part of the outer wall of Fig. 320.—Schematic representa- the tympanum. It is placed tion of the membrana tympani and yery obliquely ; its lower the malleus. (From Testot.) f^j.^ border both incline inwards. With a horizontal plane it forms an angle which varies from about 40° to 45°. Its mode of attachment around the bottom of the meatus is deserving of some attention. Here, there is a ring-like ridge of bone very distinctly grooved which forms as it were a frame in which the membrane is set. But this ridge is deficient above, and at this point there is a deep notch (the notch of Rivinus) between the extremities of the bony ridge. This notch is occupied by a portion of the membrane which is not so dense in its texture (see- 1. Processus brevis of malleus. 2. Attachment of membrana tympani. ■\. Umbo. 4. External meatus. 5.

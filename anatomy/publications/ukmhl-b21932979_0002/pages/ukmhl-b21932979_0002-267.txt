SIDE OF THE NECK. 245 The cervical plexus thus formed has very definite relations. It lies under cover of the upper part of the sterno-mastoid Fig. 218.—Diagram of the cervical plexus and the ansa hypoglossi. I., II., III., IV.—Anterior primary divisions of the upper four cervical nerves. R. Branches to recti muscles. G.A. Great auricular. S.M. Branches to the sterno-mastoid. S.O. Small occipital. T.C. Superficial cervical. L.A.S. Branches to levator anguli scapula. D.T. Descending trunk. C. Communicating to fifth cervical. P. Phrenic. C.C. Rami communicantes hypo- glossi. C. H. Communicating branch to hypo- glossal. H. Hypoglossal. T.H. Thyro-hyoid nerve. D. H. Descendens hypoglossi. A. H. Ansa hypoglossi. This diagram shows that the descendens hypoglossi, the brancli to the thyro-hyoid, and in all probability the br.-indhes to the genio- hyoid, are composed of fibres given to the hypoglossal by the com- municating twigs it receives from the first cervical nerve. and in front of the scalenus medius and the levator anguli scapulse muscles.

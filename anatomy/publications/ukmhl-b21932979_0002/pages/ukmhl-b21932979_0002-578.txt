THE BRAIN. 554 ceeding upwards from the lower quadrigeminal body advances towards the corpus geniculatum internum, and disappears from view under cover of this prominence. Upon the opposite side of this same geniculate body, the mesial root of origin of the optic tract is observed to arise, and the appearance is such that the dissector might very naturally conclude that the inferior brachium and this root of the optic tract are continuous. It is very doubtful, however, if this is the case. The superior brachiu77i is carried upwards and forwards between the overhanging pulvinar and the corpus geniculatum internum. It partly enters the corpus geniculatum externum, but a portion of it can easily be observed to be directly con- tinuous with the lateral root of the optic tract. The optic tract, therefore, arises by two roots—a mesial and a lateral. The mesial root emerges from under the inner geniculate body. The lateral root is continuous with the superior brachium, and through it with the superior quadrigeminal body. It also is closely connected with, and derives fibres from, the corpus geniculatum externum and the pulvinar. The optic tract thus formed curves round the outer side of the upper part of the crus cerebri to reach the optic chiasnia. Crura Cerebri.—The crura cerebri constitute the chief bulk of the mesencephalon. When viewed from below, they appear as two large rope-like strands, which emerge close together from the upper aspect of the pons Varolii, and diverge as they proceed upwards to enter the cerebrum. At the point where each crus disappears into the corresponding side of the hemisphere, it is embraced on its outer side by the optic tract. The crus cerebri of each side consists of two parts, viz., a dorsal tegme?itum, which is prolonged upwards to the region PULVINAR Fig. 301.—Diagram of the roots of the optic tract.

47 THORACIC CAVITY. vein is devoid of a valve. The oblique vein is very minute, and would not deserve special mention, were it not that it represents the lower pervious part of the obliterated left superior vena cava of the embryo. The great cardiac vein (vena cordis magna) begins upon the anterior aspect of the heart at the apex. It ascends in the anterior interventricular groove to the auriculo-ventricular furrow, in which it turns round the left margin of the heart to join the coronary sinus. On its way it is joined by numerous veins from the surface of both the ventricular and auricular parts of the heart. The anterior cardiac veins will be seen on the front sur- face of the right ventricle. They open directly into the right auricle. But, in addition to those veins which appear upon the surface, there are minute vessels in the substance of the heart—the vence Thebes ii or vence minimce cor dee—the orifices of which will be recognised, when the right auricle is opened, as the foramina Thebesii. The cardiac veins, therefore, which drain the blood from the heart, do not correspond with the arteries. The follow- ing table expresses the arrangement in a brief form : Great cardiac vein.

It is only in a heart which has been specially injected that all these veins can be seen. The general arrangement, however, can usually be studied in the course of an ordinary dissection. In certain cases, where the veins are empty and the fat on the surface of the heart scanty, they may be inflated with air by introducing a blow-pipe into some of the larger members of the series.

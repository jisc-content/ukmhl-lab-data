64 THORAX. direction, and becomes continuous with the descending thoracic aorta. The Ascending Aorta (aorta ascendens) extends from the base of the left ventricle, in a curved direction, to the upper border of the second right costal cartilage. For the most part it lies behind the sternum, but it projects slightly beyond the right margin of the bone at the level of the second inter- costal space. Throughout almost its entire length it is enclosed within the fibrous pericardium, whilst the same sheath of serous pericardium surrounds it and the pulmonary artery. It is, therefore, placed within the middle medias- tinum (Figs. 174 and 177, p. 57 and 67). It does not possess a uniform diameter. At its root, opposite the segments of the aortic valve, it presents the three bulgings termed the sinuses of Valsalva; whilst higher up, on cross section, it generally exhibits a transversely oval and not a circular outline. This is due to the presence of a diffuse bulging of the right wall, which receives the name of the great aortic sinus. Against the wall of this sinus the blood is driven with great force as it leaves the ventricle, and at first sight it might seem to be aneurismal in its origin, but its presence in the foetus renders such a view unten- able. It is, however, a very favourite site for aneurismal dilatation. The more immediate relations of the ascending aorta may now be examined. It is intimately associated with the pul- monary artery throughout its entire length. At its origin it lies behind the root of the pulmonary artery ; higher up, this vessel is placed to the left of the ascending aorta. To its right side is the superior vena cava, whilst behind, it is in relation to the left auricle and the right pulmonary artery (Figs. 174 and 177). It is overlapped by the right pleura and the anterior thin margin of the right lung, which intervene between it and the chest wall. The coronary arteries have already been seen to spring from this portion of the aorta.

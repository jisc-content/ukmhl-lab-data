HEAD AND NECK. 236 and then compare it with that of the left side. The first part of the right subclavian extends obliquely upwards and outwards, and at its termination, at the inner margin of the scalenus anticus, it has reached a point above the level of the clavicle. It is placed very deeply. In front, it is covered by the skin, superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia, and three muscular strataâ€”viz., the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, the sterno-hyoid, and the sterno-thyroid. Three veins and some nerves are also placed in front of it. Thus, it is crossed by the internal jugular and vertebral veins, as these proceed from above downwards, whilst the anterior jugular vein, as it passes outwards under cover of the sterno-mastoid, is separated from it by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles. The nerves which cross it are the vagus, with one or two cardiac branches as they run towards the thorax, and a loop from the sympathetic. As the vagus nerve leaves the artery it gives off its recurrent branch. The first part of the subclavian artery presents most important relations to the pleura. The cervical dome of this membrane bulges upwards behind it so that the vessel rests upon its anterior surface a short distance from its summit. The sympathetic cord passes downwards behind the artery, and the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve hooks round it, and is thus related to it both below and behind. Immediately below the first part of the subclavian, and upon a more anterior plane, the right innominate vein is formed by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian trunks. On the left side, the first part of the subclavian ascends almost vertically from its origin from the aortic arch, and reaching the root of the neck, turns abruptly outwards upon the pleura to gain the inner margin of the scalenus anticus. It is only with that portion of the vessel which lies in the root of the neck that we are concerned at present. Its

These are the anterior and posterior atlanto-axial, and the anterior and posterior atlanto-occipital. The four capsular ligaments may also be more or less satisfactorily studied at the same time. The Anterior Atlanto-axial Ligament (Fig. 250, 11) may be regarded as being to a certain extent a continuation upwards of the anterior common ligament of the spine. Below it is attached to the fore aspect of the body of the axis, whilst above it is fixed to the anterior arch of the atlas. It is thick and strong in the middle, but thins off towards the sides. The Posterior Atlanto-axial Ligament fills up the interval between the laminae of the axis vertebra and the posterior arch of the atlas, to the contiguous margins of which it is attached. It is broad and membranous, and is the representative, as its attachments show, of the ligamenta subflava. It is pierced on each side by the second cervical nerve as this passes backwards over the neural arch of the axis. The Atlanto-axial Capsular Ligaments can be examined from the outside. They are somewhat lax, and on remov-

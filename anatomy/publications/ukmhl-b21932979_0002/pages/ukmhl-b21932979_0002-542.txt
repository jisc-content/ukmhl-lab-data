520 THE BRAIN. lies between the internal parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures. The gyrus lingualis (Fig. 284) is a well marked con- volution between the calcarine fissure above and the posterior part of the collateral fissure below, which stretches fonvards from the occipital pole. Anteriorly it becomes very narrow, and joins the hippocampal part of the limbic lobe. It lies partly on the mesial and partly on the tentorial surface of the occipital lobe. Tentorial Surface of the Occipital Lobe.—On this aspect there is only one convolution, viz., the posterior part of the occipito-teniporalgyrus {F\g. 285). It proceeds continuously forwards into the temporal lobe on the outer side of the collateral fissure, and it is bounded externally by the occipito-temporal sulcus—a furrow which is rarely continuous, but is usually represented by a series of detached pieces. The External Surface of the Occipital Lobe.—There are two well marked sulci on this face of the occipital lobe— viz., the sulcus occipitalis transversus and the sulcus occipi- talis lateralis. The sulcus occipitalis transversus (Fig. 282, s.t.) extends transversely across the upper part of the lobe behind the arcus parieto-occipitalis. It has already been described as the terminal bifurcation of the ramus occipitalis of the intra- parietal sulcus of Turner. The sulcus occipitalis lateralis (Fig. 282, occ. lat.) is a short horizontal furrow which divides the outer surface of the lobe into an upper and a lower area of very nearly equal extent. These areas are connected by means of superficial annectant gyri with the parietal and temporal lobes. The Boundaries of the Temporal Lobe.—The temporal lobe lies behind the stem and below the posterior horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It is somewhat pyramidal in form, and presents an upper, an outer, and a tentorial surface, with a free projecting apex or pole. Above, it is bounded by the posterior horizontal limb of the

RETINAL ARTERIES AND VEINS. 625 the centre of the human retina, and therefore in the axis of the globe of the eye, there is a small yellowish spot termed the macula lutea} It is somewhat oval in outline, and in its centre it is depressed, thereby forming what is called the fovea centralis. Retinal Arteries and Veins.—In a fresh eyeball the arteria retina centralis (Fig. 335) will be seen entering the retina at the optic disc. It immediately divides into an ascending and a descending branch, and each of these breaks up into a large outer or temporal division, and a Fig. 335.—Diagram of the retina and retinal vessels as seen from the front. The veins are represented black, whilst the arteries are drawn in outline. smaller inner or nasal division. These ramify in the retina as far as the ora serrata ; but the resultant branches do not anastomose with each other nor with any of the other vessels in the eyeball. The retinal veins converge upon the optic disc, and dis- appear into the substance of the optic nerve in the form of two small trunks which soon unite. ^ There is no macula lutea in the eyeball of the ox or sheep.

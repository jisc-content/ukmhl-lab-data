MOUTH AND PHARYNX. 411 faucium. It is a large obliquely placed aperture, which slopes from above downwards and backwards. Somewhat triangular in form, it is broadest in front, where it is bounded by the uprightly placed epiglottis. Behind it is narrow, and ends in the interval between the two arytenoid cartilages ; on either side stretches a sharp fold of mucous membrane, called the aryteno-epiglottidean fold. On either side of the posterior part of the laryngeal open- ing, between the arytenoid cartilage and the posterior part of the ala of the thyroid cartilage, there is a small down- wardly directed recess, which presents a wide entrance but Fig. 257.â€”Transverse section through the neck at the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. rapidly narrows towards the bottom (Fig. 257). It is called the sinus pyriformis, and it is important to the surgeon because it is in this little pocket that foreign bodies intro- duced into the pharynx are most liable to be caught. Be- low the opening of the larynx, the anterior and posterior walls of the pharynx are always closely applied,.to each other, except during the passage of food. The oesophageal openitig is placed opposite the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. This is the narrowest part of the pharynx. SINUS PYRirORMiS C.CAROTID.A. INT.JUC.VEIH. DE5CENDENS HYPOGLOSSI

The capacity and shape of this section of the cavity is influenced to a certain extent by the contraction of the nasal muscles. The Atrium Meatus Medii (Fig. 261, 8) is placed above, and slightly behind the vestibular district, and it receives its name from the fact that it leads directly backwards into the Fic;. 261.â€”Outer wall of the left nasal fossa.

SIDE OF THE NECK. 257 the mandible. In its course through the neck, it presents stages very similar to those already noticed in connection with the external carotid. Thus it first lies in the carotid triangle, then it disappears under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid muscle and the hypoglossal nerve; and finally it is enclosed within the substance of the submaxillary gland. With regard to this latter part of the artery, it is necessary that the dissector should note : (i) that the vessel can be disengaged from the submaxillary gland by dissection without lacerating the gland structure; it is placed, as it were, in a deep furrow in the gland substance ; (2) that in this part of its course it is almost horizontal, and parallel with the lower margin of the mandible; (3) that on emerging from the gland it turns abruptly upwards to reach the face ; and (4) that the facial vein passes backwards and downwards superficial to the submaxillary gland. Four named branches spring from the facial artery in the cervical part of its course :— 1. The inferior palatine. 2. The tonsillitic. 1. The submaxillary. 2. The submental. The inferior palatitie artery (arteria palatina ascendens) is given off for the supply of the soft palate, but it also gives branches to the tonsil and Eustachian tube. It ascends between the stylopharyngeus and styloglossus muscles. The tonsillitic artery (ramus tonsillaris) goes to the tonsil, and at present is seen disappearing between the internal pterygoid and styloglossus muscles. Both of these vessels will be traced to their destination in the deep dissection of the neck, and in the dissection of the pharynx. The submaxillary branches are given to the gland during the sojourn of the facial artery in its midst. The submental arlety (arteria submentalis) is a branch of some size. It springs from the facial, close to the base of the mandible, and then runs forwards upon the VOL. II.—17

339 DEEP DISSECTION OF THE NECK. foramen. The glosso-pharyiigeal occupies the foremost position, and it is cut off from the others by possessing a special and separate tube-Uke sheath of dura mater. The spinal accessory is placed behind the vagus, and both are included within the same sheath of dura mater. They therefore traverse the foramen in close contact with each other. Reaching the exterior of the skull, the three nerves at first lie together with the hypoglossal nerve in the interval between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, but soon they choose different routes. The spinal sheath of dura mater around vagus and spinal sheath of dura mater around Fig. 239.â€”Diagram of the relation of parts in the jugular foramen. accessory inclines backwards over or behind the internal jugular vein; the glosso-pharyngeal inclines forwards over the internal carotid; whilst the vagus proceeds vertically downwards between these vessels (Fig. 239). In an ordinary dissection it is impossible to follow out many of the minute twigs which take origin from these nerves in the region of the ba,sis cranii. To do so it is necessary to possess a perfectly fresh part, which has been specially prepared by having the soft parts toughened with spirit and the bone softened by immersion in a weak solution of acid. Even then the dissection is a difficult one, although it should

On looking into its interior from above it will be seen to be subdivided into three portions by two elevated folds of mucous membrane which extend from before backwards, and project inwards from each side of the cavity. The upper pair of folds are termed the false vocal cords; the lower pair receive the name of the true vocal cords, because they are the chief agents in the production of the voice. The entire larynx is in a great measure con- structed with a view to bring about changes in the relative position and in the degree of tension of the true vocal cords. The Upper Subdivision of the laryngeal cavity (Fig. 263, A) extends from the superior aperture of the larynx down to the upper or false vocal cords. It is called the vestibule. It is bounded in front by the epiglottis and the upper part of the angular depression between the alse of the thyroid cartilage, behind by the arytenoid cartilages and the mucous membrane which stretches across the mesial plane between them, and on each side by the aryteno-epiglottidean folds. The width of this portion of the laryngeal cavity diminishes from above downwards, and its depth diminishes in a marked degree from before backwards. Above, it com- municates with the pharynx by the superior aperture of the larynx, whilst below it is continuous with the middle sub- division of the cavity through the interval between the false vocal cords. The superior aperture of the larynx (ostium pharyngeum laryngis) has already been examined in the dissection of the pharynx (p. 410). The parts which bound it should again be carefully studied. The epiglottis projects upwards behind the root of the tongue. Its lingual or anterior surface is only free in the upper part of its extent, and is attached to the back part of the tongue by a prominent mesial fold of mucous mem- brane, termed the middle glosso-epiglottidean fold or frcenum of the epiglottis. Two lateral folds are also present which

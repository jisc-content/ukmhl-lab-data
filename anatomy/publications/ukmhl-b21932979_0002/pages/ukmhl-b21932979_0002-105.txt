83 THORACIC CAVITY. and, in many cases, the vena azygos minor superior. To the left side, and closely applied to the vessel, is that part of the pleura which forms the left lateral wall of the posterior media- stinum ; whilst on its right side will be noticed the thoracic duct and the vena azygos major (Figs. 177, 180, and 181). The oesophagus has a varying and important relationship to the thoracic aorta. At first it lies to the right of the aorta, but as it approaches the diaphragm it inclines to the left, and comes to lie i7i front of the vessel; and lastly, before it passes through the oesophageal opening of the diaphragm, it is somewhat to its left side. The Branches of the Descending Thoracic Aorta may be grouped under the heads of visceral and parietal. Visceral. Bronchial. Pericardiac. Qisophageal. Posterior mediastinal. Parietal. Intercostal (nine on each side) The bronchial arteries are usually three in numberâ€”Hvo for the left lung and one for the right lung. They are very variable in their manner of origin. The right bronchial artery often springs from the first aortic intercostal artery. The left bronchial arteries generally take origin from the aorta. They run upon the posterior aspect of the cor- responding bronchus, and they have already been studied as constituent parts of the roots of the lungs. In the substance of the lung, they follow the bronchi, and show a similar mode of branching and distribution. The bronchial veins are of small size. The /<?/? opens into the vena azygos minor superior; the right joins the vena azygos major. The pericardiac branches are some minute twigs which are distributed to the posterior a.spect of the pericardium. The oesophageal arteries are the vessels of supply to the gullet. They are four or five in number, and are irregularly placed. They spring from the front or right side of the

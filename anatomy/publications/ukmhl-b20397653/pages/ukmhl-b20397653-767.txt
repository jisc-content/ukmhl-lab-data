Septum of the spiral tube (fig. 245). The partition in the recent Septum state dividing the tube of the cochlea into two passages, consists of membra? an osseous and a membranous portion :— nous- The osseous part (3), formed by the lamina spiralis, extends about Osseous half way across the tube.

Between the hamulus and the axis is a space, which is ends above converted by the membranous piece of the septum into a foramen 111 a pomt (fig. 244,/, hiatus, helicotrema), and allows the intercommunication aperture, of the two chief passages of the cochlear tube.

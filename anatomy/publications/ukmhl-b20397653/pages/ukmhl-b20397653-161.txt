147 OTIC GANGLION. distance, behind, lies the large meningeal artery. In this ganglion, structure, as in the others connected with the fifth nerve, filaments from motor, sensory, and sympathetic nerves are blended. Some twigs are fur- nished by it to muscles. Connecting branchesâ€”roots. The ganglion is joined by a fasciculus Branches from the motor part of the inferior maxillary nerve, and is closely jfj-h1* Wlt] Fig. 36.* united with the branch of that nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle, thus receiving two of its roots, motor and sensory, from the fifth nerve. Its connection with the sympathetic is established by sympa- a twig from the plexus on the large meningeal artery.-)- thetic. Branches to muscles. Two muscles receive their nerves from the other otic ganglion, viz. tensor tympani and circumflexus palati. The nerve hes to the tensor tympani, 3, is directed backwards, and enters the bony muscles, canal containing that muscle. The branch for the circumflexus, 6, arising from the front of the ganglion, may be supposed to be derived from the internal pterygoid nerve. The nerve of the internal pterygoid muscle, 5, arises from the inner Nerve of side of the inferior maxillary nerve near the skull, and penetrates pterygoid, the deep surface of the muscle. This branch is joined by a fasciculus from the motor root of the fifth nerve. Directions.

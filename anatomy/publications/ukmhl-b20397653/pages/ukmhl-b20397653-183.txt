RECTUS CAPITIS ANTICUS. 169 contiguous to the scalenus, to the vertebral vessels, and to the rectus capitis anticus major muscle. Action. Both muscles bend forwards the neck ; and the upper use. oblique fibres of one will turn the head and neck to the same side, by the attachment to the atlas and bodies of the vertebrae. The rectus capitis anticus major (fig. 45, B) is external to the Rectus preceding muscle, and is largest at the upper end. Its origin is by major* pointed tendinous slips, with the longus colli, from the summits of Origin, the anterior transverse processes of four cervical vertebra? (sixth, fifth, fourth, and third) ; and the fibres ascend to be inserted into insertion, the basilar process of the occipital bone, in front of the foramen magnum. The anterior surface of the muscle is covered by the pharynx, Connec- and by the carotid artery and the numerous nerves near the base tlons- of the skull. The muscle partly conceals the following one. At its insertion the rectus is fleshy, and reaches from the middle line to the temporal bone. Action. Both muscles incline forwards the head ; and one will Use. bring the face to the same side by rotating the head. The rectus capitis anticus minor (fig. 45, G), is a small flat Rectus muscle, which arises from the anterior transverse process and body J*2Jjjfis * Deep muscles of the front of the neck, and the scaleni muscles.

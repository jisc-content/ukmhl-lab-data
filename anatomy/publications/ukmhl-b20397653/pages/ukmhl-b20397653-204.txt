DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN". 190 and another of a vertical median section through those bodies, he will comprehend much more readily the following description of them. Position. Position. The brain is to remain in the same position as for the examination of the nerves and vessels. Upper part The medulla oblongata is the dilated upper end of the spinal cordPmal C01'd which is contained in the cranium (fig. 54). Its limit is the lower border of the pons in one direction, and the upper margin Situation. of the atlas in the other. This portion of the cord is pyramidal in Fig. 54.* Fig. 55.+ form, and measures about one inch and a quarter in length; half an inch in breadth below, and about an inch at its widest part. Base Its base joins the pons, the transverse fibres of the latter marking Apex. its limit; and its apex is blended with the spinal cord. The Surfaces. anterior surface is irregularly convex, and is in contact with the hollowed basilar process of the occipital bone. The opposite sur- face is somewhat excavated superiorly, where it forms the floor of the fourth ventricle ; and it rests in the fissure between the halves of the cerebellum. On the jDosterior aspect there are not any cross fibres of the pons, as in front, to mark the extent of the medulla. Tu^-rvn The medulla oblongata is divided into halves by a median Division ^ into halves fissure in front and behind. The fissures are in a line with those "by fissures. a]ong cord: the anterior ceases at the pons in a dilation (foramen ca3cum), but the posterior is prolonged, behind the pons, into the floor of the fourth ventricle. Components Each half of the medulla is constituted of pieces continuous with of each half. # Anterior view of the medulla oblongata and pons. 1. Anterior pyramid. 2. Lateral tract. 3.

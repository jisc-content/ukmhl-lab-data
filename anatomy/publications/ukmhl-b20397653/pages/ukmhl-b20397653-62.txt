48 DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. Upper and The upper and the lower rectus elevate and depress the fore part lower, Q£ tjie ball arouncj a transverse axis; but as their fibres are directed obliquely outwards, the upper muscle turns the pupil up and in, and the lower muscle turns it down and in. and two By the simultaneous action of two contiguous recti, the ball will Mmh*UUUb be moved to a point intermediate to that to which it would be directed by either muscle singly. Dissect infe- Dissection. By opening the optic foramen, the attachment of noi o lque. tjie recti mugcjeg be more fully laid bare. To dissect out the Fig. 12.* inferior oblique muscle, let the eyeball be replaced in its natural position ; then by taking away the conjunctival lining of the lower eyelid near the inner part of the orbit, and removing some fat, the muscle will appear beneath the eyeball, bending from the inner to the outer side : it may be followed outwards to its insertion into the ball. Lower The inferior oblique muscle (fig. 12, ") is situate near the oblique anterior margin of the orbit, and differs from the other muscles in muscle. e 7 being directed across, instead of parallel to the axis of the orbit. * Third view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections).

EXTERNAL LARYNGEAL MUSCLES. 155 terior aspect of the larynx : to denude them it will be necessary to turn over the larynx, and to remove the mucous membrane covering it. On the back of the cricoid cartilage the dissector will find the crico-aryteenoideus posticus muscle ; and above it, on the back of the arytenoid cartilages, the arytenoid muscle will appear. The crico-thykoideus muscle (fig. 39, *) is triangular in form, Oico-thy- and is separated by an interval from the one on the opposite side. It r0ldeus- arises from the front and the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage ; Origin. Fig. 39.* Fig. 40. t and its fibres ascend to be inserted into the lower cornu, and the insertion, lower border of the thyroid cartilage as far forwards as a quarter of an inch from the middle line ; also, for a short distance (a line), into the inner surface of that cartilage. The muscle rests on the crico-thyroid membrane, and is concealed by the sterno-thyroid muscle. Action. It approaches the thyroid to the cricoid cartilage, making Use. longer the distance between the thyroid and the arytenoid cartilages ; and tightens indirectly the vocal cords. The CRICO-ARYT^NOIDEUS POSTICUS MUSCLE (fig. 40, C) lies On the Crico-aryta - posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage. Its origin is from the p^fcus depression on the side of the vertical ridge at the back of that is on back cartilage. From this origin the fibres are directed outwards, and cartilage, are inserted into a projection at the outer side of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. * Front view of the larynx. 1.

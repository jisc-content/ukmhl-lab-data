98 DISSECTION OF THE SUBMAXILLARY REGION. Submaxil- lary gan- glion ; nature; joins gusta- tory, facial, connected with the three trunks of the fifth nerve, and com- municates with sensory, motory, and sympathetic nerves. It is smaller in size than the lenticular ganglion, is sometimes rather red, and is placed above the deep process of the submaxillary gland. Offsets proceed upwards to connect it with other nerves ; and from the lower part arise the branches to the adjacent structures. Connection with nerves—roots. Two or three branches, in the form of loops, pass from the ganglion to the gustatory nerve. At Fte. 23.* and sym- pathetic nerves. Branches. Chorda tympani; the posterior part the ganglion is further joined by an offset from the chorda tympani (of the facial nerve) which lies in contact with the gustatory. And its sympathetic branch comes from the nerves around the facial artery. Branches. From the lower part of the ganglion five or six branches descend to the substance of the submaxillary gland ; and from the fore part other filaments are furnished to the mucous membrane of the mouth and the Whartonian duct. Chorda tympani. Joining the gustatory above by fibrils (p. 92), it is applied to the back of that nerve till near the tongue, and can be easily separated from it; but beyond that point it enters amongst the fibres of the gustatory nerve and is conveyed to the tongue. Near the submaxillary gland an offset is sent to the submaxillary ganglion. * Deep view of the submaxillary region (Illustrations of Dissections) Muscles: A. Genio-hyo-glossus. b. Gfenio-hyoideus. c.

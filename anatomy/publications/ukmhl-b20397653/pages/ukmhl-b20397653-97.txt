83 POSITION OF VESSELS AND NERVES. After the loose piece of bone has been removed, and the sub- take it away jacent parts freed from much fat, the pterygoid muscles willand the fat- appear,—the external (2) being directed outwards to the condyle of the jaw, and the internal (3), which is parallel in direction to the masseter, being inclined to the angle of the jaw. In removing the fatty tissue, the student must be careful not to take away the thin internal lateral ligament, which lies on the internal pterygoid muscle beneath the ramus. Position of vessels. Crossing inwards over the external pterygoid Position"of muscle, is the internal maxillary artery, which distributes offsets vessels- upwards and downwards : sometimes the artery will be placed beneath the muscle. The veins with the artery are large and plexiform : they may be taken away. Position of nerves. Most of the branches of the inferior maxillary Nerves, nerve appear in this dissection. Thus, issuing from beneath the lower border of the external pterygoid are the large dental and gustatory nerves, the latter being the more internal of the two ; and coming out behind the joint of the jaw is the auriculotemporal nerve. Appearing between the upper border of the muscle and the cranium, are the small masseteric and deep temporal nerves. The buccal branch of the nerve perforates the fibres of the same muscle near the inner attachment. Branches of the internal * Superficial view of the pterygoid region (Quain's " Arteries "). 1.

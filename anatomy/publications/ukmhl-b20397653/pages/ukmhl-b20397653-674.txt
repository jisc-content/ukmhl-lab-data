DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 660 Capsule On the front it is strengthened by a wide layer of longitudinal thickened fibres (fig. 202, a, Z>, c). The central portion,—the ilio-femoral by a central ligament (a), is fixed above by a narrow piece to the lower anterior band, iliac spinous process, and below where it widens, into the anterior use; intertrochanteric line. By its strength it can arrest extension of the joint; and the femur being fixed, it will prop the pelvis. The by an outer outer edge (c ilio-trochanteric band) extends from the hip bone slip' opposite the outer head of the rectus, to the upper and fore part of the great trochanter and neck of the femur ; its use is to check llse. adduction of the femur. The inner edge (5, pubio-femoral band) and by is attached superiorly to the prominent pubic portion of the hip inner slip, bone inside the acetabulum, and inferiorly to a roughened surface at the lower part of the neck of the femur on a level with, and in use. front of the small trochanter : this band controls the abductory movement of the joint. At back of At the back of the capsule close to the neck of the femur is a capsule band of transverse fibres (fig. 203, &), about as wide as the little is a trans- finger, which arches like a collar over the neck of the bone.

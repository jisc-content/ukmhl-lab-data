MOVEMENTS IN ANKLE JOINT. 709 behind and trochlear-shaped, which touches the end of the tibia : and on its sides are articular impressions for contact with the malleoli, but the outer one is the largest. Movement. Only the movements of flexion and extension are per- Kinds of mitted in the ankle : in the former state the toes are raised towards motlon- the fore part of the leg ; and in the latter, they are pointed towards the ground. In flexion the astragalus moves backwards so as to project behind ; Flexion, and all further motion is arrested by the meeting of the anterior moving edge of the tibia with that bone. bone> The posterior ligament is stretched over the projecting head of state of the astragalus, and the posterior and middle parts of the externalllgaments- Fig. 220.* lateral, and the posterior piece of the internal lateral ligament, are made tense. In extension the astragalus moves forwards over the end of the Extension, tibia, and projects anteriorly. A limit to the movement is imposed ™0°™g by the meeting of the astragalus with the tibia behind. The lateral ligaments are partly made tight as in flexion, for ^*^ts. instance the anterior piece of the external, and the fore and middle portions of the internal. "When the joint is half extended so that the small hinder part of lateral the astragalus is brought into the arch of the leg bones, a slight movement of the foot inwards and outwards may be obtained ; but if the foot is forcibly extended the portions of the lateral liga- ments, attached to the astragalus, prevent this lateral movement by their tightness. * External lateral ligament of the ankle (altered from Bourgery). — 1.

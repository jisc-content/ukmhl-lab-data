DISSECTION OF THE LEG. 700 nerves to the interior of the articulation ; and the tendon of the popliteus pierces it. Anterior The anterior ligament (ligamentum patellar, fig. 215, 2), part of ligament, ^ ten(^on 0f insertion of the extensor muscle of the knee (p. 626), tendon is two inches long. Superiorly it is attached to the lower point extensor. of the patella, and to the depression on the inner surface of the apex ; and inferiorly it is inserted into the tubercle of the head of the tibia, and into an inch of the bone below it. An expansion of the triceps extensor covers it ; and a bursa intervenes between it and the top of the tubercle of the tibia. Open the Dissection (fie;. 216). To see the reflections of the synovial mem- knee-jomt v ^ J . . / ... brane raise the knee on blocks, and open the joint by an incision Fig. 216.* on each side, above the patella. When the anterior portion of the capsule with the patella is thrown down, a fold (mucous ligament) will be seen extending from the intercondyloid fossa of the femur to a mass of fat below the patella. On each side of the knee-pan is a similar fold (alar ligament) over some fat. and dissect The limb may be laid flat on the table, and some of the posterior ments!llSE" ligament may be removed, to show the pouches of the synovial membrane which project behind over the condyles of the femur ; but the limb is to be replaced in the former position before the parts are learnt. Synovial The synovial membrane (fig. 216) lines the interior of the capsule, membrane an(^ -g contmuec[ to the articular ends of the bones. It invests the interarticular cartilages after the manner of serous membranes, and * The capsule of the knee-joint cut across, and the patella thrown down, to show the named folds of the synovial sac. a.

DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 458 The intes- tine, follow- ing the course of the cord, has cover- ings of the peritoneum and fat, fascia trans- versalis, crernaster, spermatic fascia, superficial fascia and skin.

A piece of intestine leaving the abdomen with the cord, and passing through the inguinal canal to the surface of the body, will obtain a covering from every stratum of the wall of the abdomen in the groin, except from the transversalis muscle. It receives its investments in this order :—As the intestine is thrust outwards, it carries before it first the peritoneum and the subperitoneal fat, and enters the tube of the fascia transversalis, F, (infundibuliform fascia) around the cord. Still increasing in size it is forced downwards to the loAver border of the internal oblique muscle, where it will have the cremasteric fascia, c, applied to it. The intestine is next directed along the front of the cord to the external abdominal ring, and in passing through that opening re- ceives the investment of the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia. Lastly, as the hernia descends towards the scrotum, it has the additional coverings of the superficial fascia and the skin. In a hernia which has passed the external abdominal ring, the coverings from without inwards are the following :—the skin and the superficial fascia, the spermatic and cremasteric fasciae, the fascia transversalis, the subperitoneal fat, and the peritoneum or hernial sac. Two of the coverings, viz., the peritoneal and sub- peritoneal, originate as the gut protrudes ; but the rest are ready formed around the cord, and the intestine slips inside them. The different layers become much thickened in a hernia that has existed for some time. Diagnosis, If the hernia is small and is confined to the wall of the belly, it gives rise to an elongated swelling along the inguinal canal. If it has proceeded farther, and entered the scrotum, it forms a flask-shaped tumour with the large end below, and the narrow neck occupying the inguinal passage. Whilst efforts are being made to force back a piece of protruded intestine during life, the direction of the canal, and the situation of the internal abdominal ring, should be borne in mind. Seat of stricture. The protruded intestine may be constricted at the internal abdominal ring ; in the inguinal canal by the fleshy internal oblique muscle; and at the external abdominal ring. The stricture is placed usually at the inner .abdominal ring, and may be produced in two ways ;—either by a constricting fibrous band outside the narrowed neck of the tumour, or, by a thickening and contraction of the peritoneum itself at the inner surface of the neck. Divison of stricture. To set free the intestine, an incision is made down to the internal abdominal ring ; and, all fibrous bands outside the peritoneum being divided, the intestine is to be returned into the abdomen by gentle pressure. Supposing the intestine cannot be replaced in the abdomen after the previous steps have been taken, the surgeon proceeds to lay open the peritoneum, and to divide the internal stricture, from

DISSECTION OF THE PELVIS. 562 Branches of A. The three branches arising from the posterior piece of the *ariF°Steri0r in^erna^ inac may he first examined. The ilio-lumbar branch (fig. 174, A) passes outwards beneath the psoas muscle and the obturator nerve, but in front of the lumbo- sacral nerve, and divides into an ascending and a transverse branch in the iliac fossa :— The ascending or lumbar branch which is beneath the psoas, supplies that muscle and the quadratus lumborum, and anastomoses part. Ilio-lumbar has an ascendinj and with the last lumbar artery : it sends a small spinal branch through the foramen between the sacrum and the last lumbar vertebra, a transverse The transverse or iliac offset divides into branches that ramify branch. -m iliacus muscle, some running over and some beneath it. At the iliac crest these branches anastomose with the lumbar and cir- cumflex iliac arteries ; some deep twigs communicate with the obturator artery, and enter the innominate bone.

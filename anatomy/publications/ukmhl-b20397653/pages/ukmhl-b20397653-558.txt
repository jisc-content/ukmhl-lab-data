A plexus around the transverse processes. pillar of the diaphragm and the psoas, to reach the interval between the transverse processes, where each ends in an abdominal and a dorsal branch. The arteries of the right side lie beneath the vena cava. The dorsal branch continues to the Back between the transverse processes, and supplies an offset to the spinal canal (pp. 398, 415). The abdominal branches are directed outwards beneath the quad- ratus lumborum, and enter the posterior part of the abdominal wall, where they anastomose with the lower intercostal above, and with the circumflex iliac and ilio-lumbar arteries below : these branches supply the psoas and quadratus muscles ; and the last furnishes an offset to the teguments with the ilio-hypogastric nerve. The lumbar veins are the same in number, and have the same course as the arteries. Commencing by the union of a dorsal and an abdominal branch at the root of the transverse process, each trunk is directed forwards to the vena cava. They open into the back of the cava, either singly, or conjointly with those of the opposite side. On the left side the veins are longer than on the right, and pass beneath the aorta. Around the transverse processes, and beneath the psoas muscle, the lumbar veins communicate freely with one another, with the ilio-lumbar, and sometimes with the common iliac, so as to form a plexus of veins. Issuing above from the plexus is a small branch, the ascending lumbar vein, which joins the azygos vein of the corresponding side of the body.

666 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. Inner border of the foot. Outer border. Dorsal artery. Position of the part. Take away the skin, seek cu- taneous nerves in the fat. Superficial fascia. Two super- ficial veins. Internal saphenous, external saphenous. Cutaneous arteries. Cutaneous nerves. Internal saphenous. Prominences of the foot At the inner border of the foot, about an inch in front of the internal malleolus, is the prominent scaphoid bone pointing out the spot at which an amputation (Chopart's) is practised; whilst one inch and a half farther forwards is a slight depression marking the articulation between the internal cuneiform and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. About the centre of the outer border of the foot is the eminence of the tarsal end of the fifth metatarsal bone. A line over the dorsum of the foot, from the centre of the ankle joint to the interval between the inner two toes, will lie over the position of the main artery. Position. For the dissection of the back of the leg, the limb is to be placed on its front, with the foot over the side of the dissecting- table ; and the muscles of the calf are to be put on the stretch by fastening the foot. Dissection. For the removal of the skin, one cut may be made along the middle of the leg to the sole of the foot, where a trans- verse incision is to be carried over the heel. The two resulting flaps, of skin may be raised,—the outer one as far as the fibula, and the other as far as the inner margin of the tibia. In the fat the cutaneous nerves and vessels are to be followed. On the inner side, close to the tibia, is the internal saphenous vein with the nerve of the same name, together with twigs of the internal cutaneous near the knee. In the centre of the leg lies the external saphenous vein, with the small sciatic nerve as its companion abover and the external saphenous nerve below the middle of the leg. On the outer side, in the upper third, cutaneous offsets of the external popliteal nerve will be met with. The superficial fascia, or the fatty layer of the back of the leg, is least thick over the tibia. Over the line of the superficial vessels it may be separated into two layers. Superficial Veins. Two veins appear in the dissection of the back of the leg, which are named saphenous—inner and outer. The internal saphenous vein (fig. 206, d) begins in an arch on the dorsum of the foot (p. 689). Ascending along the leg in front of the inner ankle, and then behind the inner edge of the tibia, it reaches the thigh (p. 608). In the leg the vein is joined by super- ficial branches, and by deep roots from the tibial veins. The external saphenous vein (fig. 205, c) begins at the outer end of the arch on the dorsum of the foot, and appears below the outer ankle. The vein then courses along the back of the leg to the ham, where it ends in the popliteal vein. It receives large branches about the heel, and others on the back of the leg, communicating with the internal saphenous. Cutaneous arteries accompany the superficial veins and nerves of the leg. Cutaneous Nerves (fig. 205). The nerves in the fat of the back of the leg are prolongations of branches already met with, viz., the internal and external saphenous, external popliteal, small sciatic, and internal cutaneous of the thigh. The internal saphenous nerve (fig. 205, 7), accompanies the vein of

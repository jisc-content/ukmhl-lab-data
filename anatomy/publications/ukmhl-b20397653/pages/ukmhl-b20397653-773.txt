AUDITORY BLOOD-VESSELS AND NERVE. 759 vertical and horizontal semicircular canals (fig. 247) ; a second ends in the saccule (a) ; and the third belongs to the ampullary swelling (b) on the tube in the posterior vertical semicircular canal. On the sacs the nerve divides, and its filaments separate, some Termination fibrils passing through the otolith and others outside it, and pierce 011 the sacs' the middle layer of the wall. Now becoming axis cylinders they ending. Fig. 247.* divide, and unite in a plexus beneath the epithelium, and are thought to be united with the deep ends of the spindle-shaped cells with hair-like processes. On the ampullary enlargement of the semicircular tubes the nerve in the tubes enters the external side, where it forms a forked eminence (Steifen- projections sand), corresponding with the projection in the interior. The nerve and branch- divides at first into two chief pieces, which are directed to the sides ; ing, end and it is doubtful whether branches extend into the tube beyond those eminences. Finally filaments pierce the wall of the tube, and forming a sub-epithelial plexus of nerve-fibres, as in the utricle, are supposed to be connected with similar auditorial cells. * Distribution of nerves to the membranous labyrinth (Breschet). a. Nerve to the saccule, b. Nerve entering the ampullary enlargement on a semicircular tube. c. Branch of nerve entering the large sac or utricle.

377 LIGAMENTS OF VERTEBRA. Between the first two vertebrae and the skull there are special fibrous ligaments in the corresponding situation (p. 172). Ligaments of the spines. Along the tips of the spinous processes Ligaments of the dorsal and lumbar vertebras is a longitudinal band of fibres of spmes (fig. 115, 1),—the supraspinous ligament. It is thickest in the Fig. 114.* Fig. 115.t lumbar region of the spine, and is formed by superficial and deep fibres ; the former reach over three or more spines, whilst the latter pass from bone to bone. It is closely united with the tendons of the muscles. The band of the ligamentum nuchas, which is composed of fibrous tissue, takes its place in the neck. Along the spinal column there are also thin membranous inter- and be- spinous ligaments (fig. 108, 5), which reach from the root to the tween them* tip of the spinous processes. The strength of these bands is depen- dent upon the interval they fill; they are more marked in the lum- bar than the other vertebras, and they are least strong in the cervical region. Ligaments of the transverse processes. In the loins the inter-trans- Ligaments verse ligaments are thin membranous bands in the intervals between processes/86 the processes. In the dorsal vertebras they are round bundles of fibres (fig. 115, 4). And in the neck the fibres exist only at the apex of the processes, or they may be wanting here and there. * An inner view of the neural arches of the vertebras, with their interposed ligaments.—1 and 2.

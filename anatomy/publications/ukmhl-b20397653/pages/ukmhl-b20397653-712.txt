A kind of aponeurotic capsule is to be defined on the front of the joint : and some tendons, namely, those of the biceps, popliteus, adductor magnus, and semimembranosus, are to be followed to their insertion, a part of each being left. Articulation of the knee. The knee is the largest hinge joint in the body, and is formed by the contiguous ends of the tibia and femur, with the patella. The articular surfaces of the bones are covered with cartilage, and are maintained in apposition by strong and numerous ligaments. The capsule (fig. 214) is an aponeurotic covering on the front of the joint, which closes the wide intervals between the anterior and Fig. 214/ Fig. 215.+ how formed, the lateral ligaments ; and it is derived from the fascia lata united with fibrous offsets of the extensor and flexor muscles. It covers the anterior and the external lateral ligament, being inserted below into the heads of the tibia and fibula; and it blends on the inner side with the internal lateral ligament. It is not closely applied to the synovial membrane, but it is united below with the interarticular fibro-cartilages. Dissection. Four external ligaments, anterior and posterior, inter- nal and external, are situate at opposite points of the articulation. The posterior and the internal lateral ligament will appear on the removal of the areolar tissue from their surfaces ; but the anterior and the external lateral are covered by the aponeurosis on the front of the joint, and will not be laid bare till this has been cut * External ligament of the knee joint (Bourgery).—1.

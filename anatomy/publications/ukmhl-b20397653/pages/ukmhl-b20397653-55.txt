41 OPHTHALMIC NERVE. •the name supra-orbital, it ascends on the forehead, and supplies the external part of the head (p. 6). Whilst in the notch the nerve gives palpebral filaments to the palpebral upper lid. filaments- The supratrochlear branch (4) passes inwards above the pulley Branchy of the upper oblique muscle, and leaves the orbit to end in the puney: eyelid and forehead (p. 7). Before the nerve turns round the Fig. 10.* margin of the frontal bone, it sends downwards a branch of com- munication to the infra-trochlear branch of the nasal nerve. Fre- quently there are two supra-trochlear branches ; in such instances sometimes one arises near the back of the orbit. The lachrymal nerve (fig. 10, 3) after entering the orbit in a Lachrymal separate tube of the dura mater, is directed forwards in the outer nerve part of the cavity, and beneath the lachrymal gland to the upper ends in eyelid, where it pierces the palpebral ligament, and is distributed evelld; to the structures of the lid. The nerve furnishes branches to the lachrymal gland 5 and near offsets join superior j * First view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles :—a. Su- maxillai3- perior oblique, b.

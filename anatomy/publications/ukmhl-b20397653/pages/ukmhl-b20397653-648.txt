DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. 634 reach the popliteal artery, by which it is conducted to the back of the knee joint : its termination is seen in the dissection of the pop- liteal space (p. 655). Dissection. To prepare the profunda artery and its branches, as far as they occupy the front of the thigh, it will be requisite to follow back the internal circumflex artery above the upper border of the adductor brevis, and to trace the perforating branches to the apertures in the adductors near the femur. The profunda (fig. 196, c) is the chief muscular artery of the thigh, and arises from the femoral about one inch and a half below Poupart's ligament (p. 619). At its origin the vessel is placed on the outer side of the parent trunk ; but it is soon directed inwards beneath the femoral vessels to the inner side of the femur, and ends at the lower third of the thigh in a small branch that pierces the adductor magnus. Where the vessel lies in the triangular space of the thigh it rests on the iliacus muscle. But on the inner side of the femur it is parallel to the femoral artery, though deeper in position ; and it is placed first over the pectineus and adductor brevis, and thence to its termination between the adductors longus and magnus. Its branches are numerous to the surrounding muscles , on the front and back of the thigh, and maintain free anastomoses with other vessels of the thigh and leg (p. 659) : through these com- munications the blood finds its way to the lower part of the limb when the chief artery is obliterated either above or below the origin of the profunda. The named branches are these :— The external circumflex artery (fig. 196, e) has been described in the dissection of the muscles of the front of the thigh (p. (327). The internal circumflex branch (fig. 196, d) arises from the inner and posterior part of the profunda, and turns backwards between the psoas and pectineus, but above the adductor brevis and magnus. Opposite the small trochanter it ends in two branches, which will be seen in the dissection of the buttock (p. 648). It supplies the undermentioned offsets to the inner side of the thigh :— An articular artery may enter the hip joint through the notch in the acetabulum. At the border of the adductor brevis two muscular branches arise :—one ascends to the obturator and the superficial adductor muscles ; the other, which is larger, descends with the deep piece of the obturator nerve beneath the adductor brevis, and ends in this and the largest adductor. The perforating brandies, three in number, pierce the tendons of some of the adductor muscles close to the linea aspera of the femur : they supply muscles on the back of the thigh, and wind round the thigh-bone to end in the vasti (p. 659). The first (f) begins opposite the lower border of the pectineus, and perforates the short and large adductors.

OSSICLES, LIGAMENTS, AND MUSCLES. 745 The stapes (fig. 239) lias a base or wider portion, and a head, with stapes: two sides or crura, like a stirrup. The base (d) is formed by a base; thin osseous plate, which is convex at one margin and almost straight at the ether, corresponding with the shape of the fenestra ovalis : the surface turned to the vestibule is convex, while the opposite is excavated. The head (a) is marked by a superficial head; depression which receives the orbicular process of the incus ; and below it is a constricted part (6), the nech of the bone. The crura crura, (c) extend from the neck to the base, and are grooved on the inner surface : the anterior crus is shorter and straighter than the other. Position of the ossicles (fig. 240). The malleus (d) is placed verti- ^^Sieus cally in the tympanum, with the head upwards, and the joint sur- face turned backwards to articulate with the incus. Its handle is inserted externally into the membrana tympani between the mucous and fibrous layers ; and its long process is directed forwards into the Glaserian fissure. The incus (e) is also upright, so that the long process is vertical, of the incus, and the short one horizontal. Externally it is united with the mal- leus ; the short process is received into the large aperture of the mastoid cells ; and the long one descends, like the handle of the malleus, but rather posterior to it and nearer the inner wall of the and of the cavity, to join inferiorly with the stapes. stapes. The stirrup bone (f) has a horizontal position, with the crura directed forwards and backwards : its base is fixed over the fe- nestra ovalis, and its head is united with the long process of the incus. Ligaments of the ossicles. The small bones of the tympanic cavity The bones are united into one chain by joints, and are further kept in position ^g6^^. by ligaments fixing them to the surrounding wall. ments; & Joints of the bones. Where the ossicles touch they are connected either to together by articulations corresponding with the joints of larger another16 Â° bones ; for the osseous surfaces are covered with cartilage, are sur- rounded by a thin capsular ligament of fibrous tissue, and lubricated by a synovial sac. One articulation of the nature above described exists between the heads of the malleus and incus, and a second be- by joints, tween the extremity of the long process of the incus and the head of the stapes. Union of the bones to the wall. The bones are kept in place by the or to fix reflection of the mucous membrane over them, and by special liga- tyfnpanichftj ments. From the head of the malleus a short suspensory band of wall, fibres is directed upwards to the roof of the tympanum. Another ligamentous band (posterior) passes backwards from the incus, near the end of its short process, to the bone supporting it. And the base of the stapes is connected to the margin of the fenestra ovalis by fibres constituting an orbicular ligament. In the recent bone the thin mucous membrane closes the interval Membrane between the crura of the stapes, and is attached to the groove on of staPes- the inner aspect.

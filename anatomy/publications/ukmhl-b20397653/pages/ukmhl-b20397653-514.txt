DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. 500 a collection which, are round or oval in form, and are covered by the mucous of follicles, membrane. Around each follicle is a ring of apertures of the crypts before described. The follicles have the same composition as the scattered " solitary glands." Arteries. Fine arterial twigs (fig. 150, B) ramify on the follicles, and send inwards capillary offsets which form a network in the interior, and Fig. 151.* Lacteals. converge to the centre. Lacteal vessels form plexuses around and beneath the follicle, but do not penetrate the wall. Glands of The Glands of Brunner (fig. 152, b) are small compound bodies, Brunnei, simjiar to the buccal and labial glands of the mouth, which exist in the duodenum. For a few inches near the pylorus they are most numerous, and there they are visible without a lens, being nearly as large as hemp seed. The glands consist of lobules, with appertaining excretory tubes : and each ends on the surface of the mucous membrane by a duct (c), whose aperture is slightly larger than the mouths of the contiguous crypts of Lieberkiihn ; they secrete mucus. Epithelium. The epithelial lin- ing of the mucous membrane of the small intestine is of the columnar or cylindrical kind. On the villi it forms a distinct cover- ing of elongated pieces. It sinks into the crypts of Lieberkiihn, and into the ducts of the glands of Brunner, and gives them a lining. * A. A piece of mucous membrane enlarged, with its villi and tubules. Part of a patch of Peyer's gland is also represented with the follicles {a), each having a ring of tubes at the circumference, b. A "solitary gland" of the small intestine, also enlarged, covered by villi (Boehm). f Magnified view of the mucous membrane of the duodenum with the tubules of Lieberkiihn, and a gland of Brunner. a.

525 SEMINAL TUBES OF TESTIS. vessels, so that they may be readily drawn out of the testis for some distance : their length is said by Lauth to be two feet and a length, quarter. Ending, size and structure. Within the lobes of the testis some Communi- tubes end in distinct closed extremities ; but the rest communicate, catl01ls» forming loops or arches. The diameter of the tubules varies from _i__th to y-g-Qth of an inch. The wall of the tubule is formed of a size; thin translucent membrane, but it has considerable strength. Lining the interior in the child is a nucleated granular epithelium, with structure; polygonal cells ; but in the adult the tube is filled by cells of the spermatic corpuscles in different stages of development. On the exterior is a plexus of bloodvessels. Names from the arrangement of the tubes. To different parts of change their the seminal tubes, the following names have been applied. Where name, the tubules are collected into masses, they form the lobes of the testis. As they enter the fibrous mediastinum they Fig. 167 * become straight, and are named tubuli recti. Com- municating in the medias- tinum, they produce the rete testis. And, lastly, as they leave the upper end of the gland they are convoluted, and are called coni vasculosi, or vasa efferentia. The lobes of the testis (fig. 167, a) are formed by bundles of the seminiferal tubes, and are situate in the intervals between the processes of the tunica albuginea : their num- ber is differently stated :—according to one authority (Berres) they number, are 250 ; but according to another (Krause) 400 or more. They are conical in form, with the base of each at the circumference, shape, and the apex at the mediastinum testis ; and those in the centre of the testicle are the largest. Each is made up of one, two or more tortuous seminal tubules ; tubes in and the minute tubes in one lobe are united with those in the arrange- neighbouring lobes. Towards the apex of each lobe the tubules ment- become less bent, and are united together ; and the tubuli of the several lobes are further joined at the same spot into larger canals —the tubuli recti.

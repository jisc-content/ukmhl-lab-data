Mucous The mucous membrane of the trachea lines the tube, and resembles epithelium, that of the larynx in being furnished with a columnar ciliated epi- thelium. and glands. Connected with this membrane are numerous branched mucous. glands of variable size. The largest are found at the back of the trachea, in the interval between the cartilages, where some are placed beneath the fibrous membrane with the muscular fibres, and others outside that layer. Other smaller glands occupy the front and sides of the trachea,, being situate on and in the fibrous tissue connecting the cartila- ginous rings. Section XVIII. Deep muscles of spine. Dissection.

On the piece of the spinal column which Avas laid aside after the separation of the pharynx from it the student is to learn the deep muscles on the front of the vertebrae. Dissection. The prevertebral muscles will be prepared by removing" the fascia and areolar tissue. The muscles are three in number on each side (fig. 45), and are easily distinguished. Nearest the middle line, and the longest, is the longus colli; the muscle external to it, which reaches to the head, is the rectus capitis anticus major ; and the small muscle close to the skull, which is external to the last and partly concealed by it, is the rectus capitis anticus minor. The smaller rectus muscle is often injured in cutting through the basilar process of the occipital bone. The longus colli muscle (fig. 45, A) is situate on the bodies of the cervical and upper dorsal vertebras, and is pointed above, but larger below. It consists of two partsâ€”internal and external, the former being vertical, and the latter oblique in direction, as on the right side of the figure. The internal piece arises by fleshy and tendinous processes from the bodies of the two upper dorsal and two lower cervical verte- brae ; and the external piece takes origin from the anterior trans- verse processes of four cervical vertebrae (sixth, fifth, fourth and third). Both parts of the muscle are blended above, and the whole is inserted by four slips into the bodies of the four upper cervical vertebrae. Some of the lowest fibres of the muscle are attached separately by tendon to the anterior transverse process of one or two of the lower cervical vertebrae. In contact with the anterior surface of the muscle is the pharynx* The inner border is at some distance inferiorly from the muscle of the opposite side, but superiorly only the pointed anterior common ligament of the vertebrae separates the two. The outer border is

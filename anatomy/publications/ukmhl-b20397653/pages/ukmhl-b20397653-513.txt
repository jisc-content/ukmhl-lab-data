499 PATCHES OF PEYEP. ileum. Placed on all parts of the intestine, and even on or between the valvulse conniventes ; they are covered by the villi of the mucous membrane, and are surrounded at their circumference by apertures of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. They are closed lymph Compo- follicles beneath the mucous coat, which project into the gut ; and sltlon- Fig. 150.* A B they are formed of a network of reticular connective tissue with lymph-corpuscles between the meshes. Fine capillary vessels per- meate the mass ; and it is surrounded by a plexus of lymphatic vessels. The glands of Peyer (fig. 151, A, glandular agminatas) exist Patches of chiefly in the ileum, in the form of oval patches, which measure Peyer' from half an inch to two inches or more in length, and about half an inch in width. They are situate on the part of the intestine Size: opposite to the attachment of the mesentery, and their direction is situation; longitudinal in the gut : usually they are from twenty to thirty in number. In the lower end of the ileum they are largest and most number; numerous ; but they decrease in number and size upwards from pecuiiari- that spot, till at the lower part of the jejunum they become irregu- ties- lar in form, and may consist only of small roundish masses. The mucous membrane over them is hollowed into pits (fig. 150, &), and is generally destitute of villi on the subjacent follicles (fig. 151, A)j but between the pits it has the same characters as in other parts.

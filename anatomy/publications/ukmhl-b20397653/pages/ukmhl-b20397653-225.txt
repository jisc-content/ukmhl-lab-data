BOUNDS OF LATEEAL VENTRICLE. 211 The lower or descending portion of the ventricle winds beneath The descend- the optic thalamus, and forms a curve like the half-bent fore finger. mg part: The roof is formed by the optic thalamus and the contiguous part roof; of the hemisphere. In the floor is a large curved, convex eminence, floor> somewhat indented at the end,—the hippocampus major (7) ; and along its concave margin is a thin white band—tsenia which is prolonged from the fornix. External to the projection of the anybodies Fig. 63.* hippocampus is another white eminence, the eminentia collaterals which tapers from above down. In this cornu of the ventricle is the vascular fringe of the plexus choroides. The septum lucidum (fig. 63, 6), or the thin structure between the Septum lateral ventricles, is translucent, and hangs vertically in the middle lucidum; line along the anterior two thirds of the corpus callosum. It is position, somewhat triangular in form, with the base turned forwards, form, and the pointed extremity backwards. Its surfaces look to the surfaces, * View of the lateral ventricles : on the left side the descending cornu is laid open. (From a cast in the museum of University College, London.) a.

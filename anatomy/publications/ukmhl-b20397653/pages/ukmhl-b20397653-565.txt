The distance the of the pouch from the anus is commonly about four inches ; but anus vary" it will vary with the state of the bladder, for if this viscus is distended the peritoneum will be raised, and removed farther from the end of the intestine. False ligaments of the bladder. Where the peritoneum is reflected False liga- from the bladder to the pelvic wall, it gives rise to a wide piece of the bladder, membrane, which constitutes the false ligaments of that viscus, vlz->— Fig. 172.* though without any subdivision of it into pieces. These are said to be five in number :—two posterior, two lateral, and one superior. The posterior ligament (one on each side) reaches from the back two poste- of the pelvis to the bladder, and contains the obliterated hypogastric 1101' artery, the ureter, and smaller vessels, and nerves. Between these is the hollow of the recto-vesical pouch. The lateral ligament, also one on each side, the widest, is reflected two lateral, from the side of the bladder to the iliac-fossa and the wall of the pelvis. Along its line of attachment to the bladder is the obliterated hypogastric artery. The superior ligament is prolonged from the top of the bladder and one superior * Side view of the dissected male pelvis, a. Urinary bladder, b. Prostate. c. Membranous part of the urethra, d.

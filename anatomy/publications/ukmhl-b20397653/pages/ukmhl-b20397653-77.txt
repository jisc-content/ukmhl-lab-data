The inner lias its head is fixed by a narrow tendon to the anterior surface of the sternum first piece of the sternum ; and the outer head has a wide fleshy and clavicle, attachment to the sternal third of the clavicle. From this origin the heads are directed upwards, the internal passing backwards, Fig. 15* and the external almost vertically, and are blended about the middle of the neck in a roundish belly. Near the skull the muscle and inser- ends in a tendon, which is inserted into the mastoid process at the tl0natskuI1 outer aspect from tip to base, and by a thin aponeurosis into a rough surface behind that process, and into the outer part of the upper curved line of the occipital bone. The muscle divides the lateral surface of the neck into two Position to triangular spaces.

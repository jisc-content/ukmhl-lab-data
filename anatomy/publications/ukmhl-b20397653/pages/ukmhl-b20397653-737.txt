723 CHARACTERS OF FIBROUS COAT. Fibrous coat of the eyeball. The outer casing of the eye con- Fibrous sists of an opaque hinder part called sclerotic, and of an anterior coat- transparent portion, the cornea. The sclerotic (cornea opaca) is the firm, whitish, and opaque Sclerotic portion of the external stratum of the eyeball, which supports the par " more delicate structures within. Dissection. To examine the inner and outer surfaces of this layer ^^j:}^11 it will be necessary to cut circularly with a scissors through the interior, cornea close to the sclerotic, and to remove the cornea from the front of the eyeball ; on piercing the cornea the aqueous fluid escapes from the containing chamber. The other structures may be then abstracted from the interior of the sclerotic covering, and may be set aside with the cornea for subsequent use. The sclerotic tunic of the eye (fig. 225, a) is bell-shaped, and ^°™tand extends from the entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the cornea, forming about five-sixths of the ball. At its back, and a little to the inner side of the centre (one tenth AgMtnrea of an inch), the optic nerve (Z) is transmitted through an aperture in it : this opening decreases in size from without inwards, and is cribriform when the nerve is drawn out—the lattice-like condition * Diagram of a horizontal section of the eyeball, a.

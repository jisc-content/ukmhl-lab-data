TS8 DISSECTION OF THE EYE. Form of the Jaminse. Fibres are wavy at the edge, and six- sided, microscope each layer may be seen to be constructed of minute parallel fibres. It consists mostly of albumen, and no bloodvessels are found in its texture. The lamina of each surface have their apices in the centre, where the septa meet ; they may be detached from one another at that spot, and may be turned outwards towards the equator of the lens. The constituent fibres of the laminae are about _ q^qth of an inch in diameter, solid, and flattened at the margin of the lens ; and the deeper fibres are narrowed and less distinct. In the superficial softer fibres are contained gra- nular nuclei (fig. 235, a). The edges are slightly wavy ; and each fibre touches six others (fig. 235, viz. two on each side, with one above, and another below : contiguous fibres are Fig. 234.* Fig. 235-f dovetailed together, and this interlocking is best seen in the lens of the codfish. The ends are soft and not well defined, and are connected with the partitions on the opposite surfaces of the lens in this way :— those attached at the union of two septa on the one aspect, are fixed to the extremity of a septum on the other aspect: and the fibres passing between two septa are nearer to the pole at one end, and farther from it at the other, while the middle ones are at the same distance from the ends of the septa on both aspects. Changes in the lens with age. The form of the lens is nearly spherical in the fetus; but its convexity decreases with age, particularly on the anterior aspect, until it becomes flattened in the adult. In the fetus it is soft, is reddish in colour, and is not quite trans- of lens'with Parent; m mature age it is firm and clear; and in old age it becomes a&e- flatter on both surfaces, denser, and of a yellowish colour. * A representation of the laminas in a hardened lens. a.

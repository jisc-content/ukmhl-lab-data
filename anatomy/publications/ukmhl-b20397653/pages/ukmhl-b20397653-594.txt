580 DISSECTION OF THE PELYIS. that sends in fibres form strata. One septal piece, which is imperfect; how formed ; and nume- rous bands and cords to form a net- work. In the cords some mus- cular fibres. Fig. 181.* Vessels. Source of the arteries termination in dilated veins, and from half a line to a line in thickness. Along the middle of the penis a septal process is sent inwards from it ; and numerous other finer threads,â€”the trabecule of the spongy structure, are connected with its inner surface. It is formed of white shining fibres which are disposed in two layers, outer and inner. The outer stratum (fig. 180, b) is formed of longitudinal fibres with close meshes. The inner stratum (fig. 180, a) consists of circular fibres, with a like plexiform disposition ; and the circular fibres of each cavernous body meeting in the middle line give rise to the septum penis. Both strata are in- separably united by communicating bundles. The septal process (fig. 181) is placed vertically along the body of the penis, and is thicker and more perfect behind than in front. Near the junction of the crura this partition divides the enclosed cavity into two ; but as it reaches forwards it becomes less strong, and is pierced by elongated apertures, which give it the appearance of a comb, from which the name septum pectiniforme is derived. Through the intervals in the septum the vessels in the corpora cavernosa communicate. It is formed by the circular fibres of the fibrous case. The cavernous or trabecular structure is a net- work of fine threads, which fills the interior of the corpora cavernosa. Its processes are thinner towards the centre than at the circumference ; and the areolar spaces are larger in the middle and at the fore part of the contained cavity, than at the circumference or in the crura of the penis. In addition to white fibrous tissue, the trabecule contain elastic fibres, and unstriated muscular fibres (Miiller). The spongy structure may be demonstrated by sections of the penis, after it has been distended with air and dried. Bloodvessels. The bloodvessels of the penis are large in size, and serve to nourish as well as to minister to the function of the organ. Having entered the cavernous mass, they ramify in the trabecular structure. The arteries of the corpora cavernosa are offsets of the pudic : ; the chief branch (art. corp. cavernosi, p. 431) enters at the crus, and runs forwards through the middle of the cavernous structure, distributing offsets ; and the rest, coming from the dorsal artery (p. 441), pierce the fibrous case along the dorsum of the penis. In the interior they divide into branches, which ramify in the trabeculas (fig 182, a), becoming finer, until they terminate in very minute branches, which open into the veins in the intertrabecular * Pectiniform septum of the penis, a.

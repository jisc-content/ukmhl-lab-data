136 DISSECTION OF THE NASAL CAVITY. Lower meatus. to on the outer wall. Anteriorly it communicates by a funnel-shaped passage (infundibulum) with the frontal sinus and the anterior eth- moidal cells ; and near its middle is a small aperture, which leads into the hollow of the upper jaw. The inferior meatus (fig. 31,8) is straighter than the middle one, and rather exceeds the width of the limited space on the outer wall ; Fourth meatus. Nares. Mucous and when the bone is clothed by the mucous membrane it extends still farther forwards. In its front is the opening of the ductus ad nasum. Occasionally there is a small fourth or rudimentary meatus above the rest (fig. 31, 9), which communicates with a posterior ethmoidal cell. The nares. In the recent condition of the nose each fossa has a distinct anterior opening in the face, and another in the pharynx ; but in the skeleton there is only one common opening in front for both sides. These apertures and the boundaries, have been before described (pp. 30 and 126). The mucous lining of the nasal fossa is called the pituitary or nosef Â°f the Schneiderian membrane ; and from its blending with the periosteum it acquires much strength. It is continuous with the integument at the nostril, and with the membrane lining the pharynx through the posterior opening : moreover, it is also continuous with the mucous membrane of the eyeball, and with that of the different sinuses, viz., frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary.

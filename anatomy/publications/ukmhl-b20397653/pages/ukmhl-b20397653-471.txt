457 EXTERNAL OR, OBLIQUE HERNIA. and the iliac crest, and half an inch above Poupart's ligament. It situation, is oval in form, the extremities of the oval being directed upwards and downwards, and measures about half an inch ; the fascia at its outer and lower parts is stronger than at the opposite sides. Arching above and on the inner side of the aperture, is the lower upper and border of the transversalis muscle, D, which is fleshy in the outer, but tendinous in the inner half. Below, it is bounded by Poupart's ^Jf^^y. ligament. On the inner side lie the epigastric vessels (a). This opening in the fascia transversalis is the inlet to the inguinal }^sec*rans" canal, and through it the cord, or the round ligament, passes into through it. Fig. 138.* the wall of the abdomen. The external hernia enters the canal at the same spot. All the protruding parts receive as a covering the prolongation from the margin of the opening. The external abdominal ring (fig. 133, Â°) is the outlet of the in- ^^j|a- guinal canal, and through it the spermatic cord reaches the surface ring; of the body. This aperture is placed in the aponeurosis of the situation, external oblique muscle, near the crest of the pubes ; and from the * Dissection for inguinal hernia (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles : a. External oblique tendon, thrown down. b. Internal oblique, the lower part raised, c. Cremaster muscle in its natural position, d. Transversalis muscle with a free border, f. Spermatic cord. g. Fascia transversalis. h. Con- joined tendon. Arteries: a. Epigastric vessels, b. Offset of the circumflex iliac to muscles.

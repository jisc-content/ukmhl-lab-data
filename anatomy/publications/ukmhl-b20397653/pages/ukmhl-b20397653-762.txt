743 DISSECTION OF THE EAR. Tympanic nerve supplies membrane and other branches, viz.: upwards, unite with the large superficial petrosal, and the facial nerve. The connections of the chorda tympani nerve can be seen on the preparation used for the muscles. The tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (fig. 241, ) nerve of Jacobson (p. 109) enters a special aperture in the temporal bone, to reach the inner wall of the tympanum. In this cavity the nerve supplies filaments to the lining membrane and the fenestra One to the sympa- thetic. Another to petrosal nerve. And a third to otic ganglion : rotunda ; and it terminates in the three undermentioned branches, which are contained in grooves on the promontory, and connect this nerve with others.f Branches. One branch is arched forwards and downwards, and enters the carotid canal to communicate with the sympathetic (3) on the artery (p. 115). A second (5) is directed upwards to join the large superficial petrosal nerve in the hiatus Fallopii (p. 143). And the third (4) has the following course :—It ascends in front of the fenestra ovalis, and near the gangliform enlargement on the * Jacobson's nerve in the tympanum (Breschet).—a. Carotid artery, b. Tensor tympani muscle. c. Inferior maxillary trunk of the fifth nerve. d. Otic ganglion, Nerves : 1. Petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal. 2. Nerve of Jacobson. 3. Sympathetic on the carotid. 4. Small superficial petrosal nerve. 5. Offset to join large petrosal nerve. 6. Branch to Eustachian tube. 7. Facial nerve ; 8. chorda tympani branch. 9. Nerve of the otic ganglion to the tensor tympani muscle. + Instead of viewing these filaments as offsets of the nerve of Jacobson, they may be supposed to come from the other nerves : according to this view the tympanic plexus would be derived from several sources.

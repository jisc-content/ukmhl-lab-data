757 STRUCTURE OF MEMBRANOUS SACS. otolith (b) opposite the entrance of the nerve ; it is also filled by endolymph, which is continued into the canal of the cochlea through the ductus reuniens (c). Structure of the sacs. The wall of the sacs of the membranous Wall of labyrinth is translucent and firm ; but it is more opaque where the ^Â® ^re vessels and nerves enter it. Three strata enter into its construction, strata: together with blood-vessels and nerves. The outer fibrous covering is loose and flocculent, is easily outer, detached, and contains irregular pigment cells with ramifying blood-vessels. The middle stratum (tunica propria) is clear and middle, tough, like the hyaloid membrane in the interior of the eyeball: its inner surface is irregular owing to slight eminences ; and in the ampulla of the semicircular tubes this layer forms the transverse projection. The inner one is formed by a layer of flattened inner. nucleated cells, which are continued over the eminences in the interior. In the region of the nerve, both in the ampulla of the semicircular tube and in the sacs, the epithelium is said to become columnar, and to have intermixed spindle-shaped nucleated cells (like the olfactorial), which possess hair-like processes at their free ends. The small calcareous masses, or the otoliths, consist of minute, otoliths elongated, six or eight-sided particles of carbonate of lime, which of^g111 are pointed at the ends, and are situate in the inner part of the wall of the utricle and saccule. Within the enlargement of each semicircular tube there is also a calcareous material. * Petrous bone partly removed to show the membranous labyrinth in place (Breschet). a.

vi PREFACE. And as the chief purpose of this book is to treat of the cha- racters and connections of Lthe component parts of the Body which are visible to the naked eye, I have not thought it neces- sary to add to the short account of the microscopic structure of the different organs in the former edition. In this, as in the preceding editions, I have endeavoured to make the work more efficient as a guide to practical knowledge. G. V. ELLIS. January9 1882.

There are other three permanent folds (Houston) which some are are half an inch or less in depth, and contain circular fibres of the pen gut. The most constant of these is about three inches from the anus, on the front of the rectum, opposite the base of the bladder; another is placed on the right side of the intestine, towards the top ; and the third is on the left side, midway between the other two. These folds will be seen by laying open the gut along the side, provided it is tolerably fresh. The mucous membrane has the same general structure as in the structure, colon, but towards the anus the secretory apparatus gradually dis- appears. Bloodvessels. The arteries are supplied from three different sources, Arteries, viz., superior hemorrhoidal of the inferior mesenteric, middle hgemor- rhoidal of the internal iliac, and inferior hemorrhoidal of the internal pudic. All three sets anastomose on the lower end of the gut; but arrangement only the upper hemorrhoidal, which is the largest, requires further h^morriiui- notice. The final branches of this artery (p. 564), about six in daL number, pierce the muscular layer three inches from the anus, and descend between the mucous and muscular coats as far as the internal sphincter, where they unite in loops just within the anus. The veins are deficient in valves, and communicate freely, like the v?j^^e arteries, in a plexus between the muscular and mucous coats, around valves, the lower end of the gut. Above, they join the inferior mesenteric vein, and through it reach the vena porte ; and, posteriorly, they pour some blood into the internal iliac vein by the middle hemor- rhoidal branch. Nerves and lymphatics. The nerves of the intestine are obtained Nerves- from the sympathetic; and those of the sphincter come from the spinal cord. The lymphatics terminate in the chain of glands on Lymphatics, the sacrum. Section YI. ANATOMY OF THE FEMALE VISCERA. In the pelvis are contained the viscera, alike in both sexes, viz., J^0^^ the bladder, urethra, and rectum : and those special to the female, or the organs of generation.

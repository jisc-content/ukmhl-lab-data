At the lower border the superior mesenteric vessels emerge opposite the coeliac axis ; to the right of that spot the third part of the duodenum is found, and to the left, the inferior mesenteric ascending to join the splenic vein. and The left end or the tail of the pancreas touches the spleen, and extremities. jg piace(j over the left kidney. The right extremity or the head is received into the concavity of the duodenum, the two being partly separated by the common bile duct and the pancreatico-duodenal arteries. This part projects above and below the body of the gland, like the head of a hammer beyond the handle ; and the lower projecting piece is directed to the left along the duodenum beneath the superior mesenteric vessels. C CELIAC AXIS AND VENA PORTiE. A short branch of the aorta,—the coeliac axis, furnishes arteries to the stomach and duodenum, the liver, pancreas, and spleen ; it subdivides into three chief branches, coronary, hepatic, and splenic. The veins corresponding with the arteries (except the hepatic) are collected into one trunk—the vena portas. Dissection. The vessels have been in part laid bare by the previous dissection, and in tracing them out fully the student should spare the plexuses of nerves around each. Supposing the liver well raised, he may first follow to the left side the small coronary artery, and show its branches to the oesophagus and the stomach. Next the hepatic artery, with the vena portse and the bile duct, may be traced to the liver and the gall bladder ; and a considerable branch of it should be pursued beneath the pylorus to and splenic, the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas. Lastly, the splenic artery, which lies along the upper border of the pancreas, is to be cleaned ; and its branches to the pancreas, stomach, and spleen should be Arteries of viscera. Veins.

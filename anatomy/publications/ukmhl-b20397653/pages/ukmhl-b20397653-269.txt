SUBSCAPULARS MUSCLE. 255 triceps (fig. 79, a), and to some fibres of the teres major, G ; these attachments will be ascertained in the progress of the dissection. The base of the bone has many muscles inserted into it (fig. 74). into the Between the superior angle and the spine is the levator anguli base; scapula, H. Opposite the spine the rhomboideus minor, J, is fixed. And between the spine and the inferior angle the rhomboideus major, k, is attached : the upper fibres of this muscle end often in an aponeurotic arch, and are connected in- directly to the bone by means of an expan- sion from it. Internal to those muscles, and inserted into all the base of the scapula, is the serratus magnus muscle (fig. 73, d). On the inner surface of the upper and lower angles of the scapula the fibres of the serra- tus magnus are col- lected. On the outer surface of the inferior angle lies the teres major (fig. 74, d) which will be subsequently seen. The insertion of the small pectoral muscle into the fore part of the upper surface of the coracoid process may be ascertained at this stage of the dissection (fig. 73, f). Dissection. By the separation of the serratus from the sub- Dissection scapularis a thin fascia comes into view, which belongs to the last and fascia, muscle, and is fixed to the bone around its margins : after it has been observed, it may be removed. The subscapularis muscle is to be followed forwards to its in- of sub- sertion into the humerus. Next, the axillary vessels, and nerves, scaPulans- and the offsets of these to the muscles, should be well cleaned. The subscapularis muscle (fig. 73, a) occupies the under surface Snbscapu- of the scapula, and is concealed by that bone when the limb is in laris its natural position. The muscle arises from the concave surface fills the on the ventral aspect of the scapula, except at the angles, and this scapula; attachment reaches forwards nearly to the neck ; it is united also to * View of the subscapularis and the surrounding muscles.

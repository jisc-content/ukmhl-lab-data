Mesenteric glands and a few lacteal vessels will come into view at the same time. •The branches from the right side of the vessel to the large intes- tine are to be next followed under the peritoneum : and after all the branches have been cleaned, the trunk of the artery should be and nerves, traced back beneath the pancreas. The plexus of surrounding nerves should be also defined.

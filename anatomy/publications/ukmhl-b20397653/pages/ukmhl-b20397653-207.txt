FIBRES OF OBLONG MEDULLA. 193 of the lateral tract, the anterior pyramid is to be cut across on the right side between its decussation and the olivary body (fig. 57), and to be raised towards the pons. The lateral tract of the medulla (b) is prolonged inferiorly into ^es^f the portion of the spinal cord between the anterior and posterior medulla roots of the nerves. The continuation of the tract ascends beneath the olivary body, and leaving the surface of the medulla enters the pass deeply,, pons (fig. 57). The olivary body, and its fillet (fig. 57, c). The olivary mass Olivary consists of three parts, viz. a gray incasing layer, a nucleus, and a comp'osi- band prolonged from itâ€”the fillet. tlon' Fig. 57.* When the olivary body has been sliced obliquely, a very thin corpus wavy layer of gray substance surrounding a nucleus of whitish dentatum matter will be apparent: this is the corpus dentatum (fig. 58,/). It forms a thin plaited capsule or bag, having a zigzag outline in a section, with the dilatation towards the surface, and the narrowed is an incom- neck open and directed backwards near the middle line. It consists plete -Fc open be- of small nucleated, and ramified nerve cells.f hind. * Fibres of the lateral tract and of the olivary body, a, Anterior pyramid fibres, cut through, and raised as far as the optic thalamus, b.

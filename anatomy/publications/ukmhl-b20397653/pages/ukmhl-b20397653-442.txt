428 DISSECTION OF THE PERINEUM. On the left be detached in the following way :—On the left side the ejaculator side. urinse is to be removed completely from the front of the ligament, and the erector muscle from the eras of the penis. Next, the eras penis is to be detached from the bone ; but this must be done with care so as not to cut the triangular ligament nor to injure, near the pubes, the terminal branches of the pudic artery and nerve to the penis. sidetne risnt On the right side the dissector should trace out beneath the trans- versalis the offsets of the perinseal nerve to the deep muscles and the urethra, with the vessels accompanying them. Fig. 131.* \ The TKIANGULAR LIGAMENT OF THE URETHRA (fig. 131, C perinseal aponeurosis) occupies the anterior part of the pubic arch, and supports the urethral canal. The ligament is triangular in form, with its base below ; and it is about one inch and a half in depth. On each side it is fixed to the pubic arch beneath the eras penis. Its apex is connected with the symphysis pubis. Its base is turned towards the rectum, and is partly attached and partty free ;—in the middle line it is united with the central point of the perinseum ; whilst laterally it is free and sloped towards the bone, so that it is less deep at the centre than at the sides : connected with the lower * Deep dissection of the perineeum (Illustrations of Dissections).

624 DISSECTION OF THE THIGH. above, but below it is formed of strong fibres, which are directed transversely between the vastus internus and the tendons of the ends below adductor muscles. Inf eriorly the membranous structure ceases at border66 ^ne °Peinng m the adductor magnus by a defined border, beneath which the saphenous nerve and its vessels escape. Deep part The deep part of the femoral artery (fig. 195, *) lies in a hollow arterjr™1 between muscles (Hunter's canal) until it reaches the opening in the adductor magnus. Here it is covered by the sartorius muscle connections, and the subjacent aponeurosis, in addition to the integuments and the superficial and deep fasciee. Beneath it are the pectineus, the adductor brevis in part, the adductor longus, and a small piece of the adductor magnus. On the outer side is the vastus internus. position of External to the artery and close to it is the femoral vein ; and in vems and integuments oftentimes an offset of the saphenous passes across the line of the arterial trunk, saphenous Crossing over the artery from the outer to the inner side is the nerve. internal saphenous nerve, which is beneath the aponeurosis before noticed, but is not contained within the areolar sheath of the vessels.

The deep branch (Z) is concealed in the fibres of the vastus internus, and descends in front of the tendon of the adductor magnus to the inner side of the knee-joint, where it anastomoses with the articular branches of the popliteal and anterior tibial arteries. A branch passes outwards from it in the substance of the vastus, and forms an arch in front of the lower end of the femur with an offset of the upper external articular artery ; from this loop twigs descend to the joint. Muscular Muscular branches. Branches for the supply of the muscles come branches. mostly from the outer side of the femoral artery ; they enter the sartorius, the vastus internus, and the adductor longus. Femoral The femoral vein corresponds closely with the femoral artery in vein- its connections and in its branches. To expose Dissection. The femoral artery and vein are to be cut across below muscles on the origin of the profunda, and are to be thrown downwards pre- femur?f the paratory to the deeper dissection. Afterwards all the fat, and all the veins, are to be carefully removed from amongst the branches of the profunda artery and anterior crural nerve. Unless this dis- section is fully carried out, the upper part of the vastus internus will not be prepare^ for learning.

246 DISSECTION OF THE UPPER LIMB. arched in the axilla. In the axillary space its position will be marked by a line from the middle of the clavicle to the inner edge of the coraco-brachialis. Its direction will vary with the position of the limb to the trunk ; for when the arm lies by the side of the body the vessel is curved, its convexity being upwards; and in proportion as the limb is re- Fig. 70.* The depth v aries. Connec- tions :— above small pectoral; with muscles, ^ moved to a right angle with the chest, the artery becomes straight- In the upper part of the axilla the vessel is deeply placed, but it becomes superficial as it approaches the arm. Its connections with the surrounding objects are numerous ; and the description of these will be methodised by dividing the artery into three parts-—one above, one beneath, and one below the small pectoral muscle. Above the small pectoral muscle the artery is contained in the axillary sheath of membrane, e. This part is concealed by the clavi- cular portion of the great pectoral muscle. Behind it are the * Second view of the dissection of the thorax (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles: A. Pectoralis major, cut. b. Pectoralis minor, c. Serratus magnus, D. Subclavius. e.

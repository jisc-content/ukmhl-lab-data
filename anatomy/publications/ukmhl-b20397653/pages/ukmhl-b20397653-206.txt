DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 192 to trace the of the constructing bodies of one half of the medulla oblongata pyramid. wn^h those of the spinal cord. Let him trace out first the fibres of the pyramid on the right side : in it two sets of fibres have to be shown—one from the same, and one from the opposite side of the cord. The fibres from the opposite half of the cord will appear in the median fissure, when the pyramids are gently drawn from one another, where they are named the decussating fibres; and to lay these bare more completely, the small part of the anterior column Fig. 56 * Fibres of anterior pyramid.; Derivation. Destination, Dissection of lateral tract. of the cord on the opposite side, which remains below the cross fibres (for the cord has been cut through near these), may be forcibly turned outwards. The anterior pyramid (fig. 56, a) receives fibres inferiorly from the anterior column of the cord of its own side, and from the opposite half of the cord. The inner set of fibres, b, deep at their origin, become superficial, and are directed upwards close to the median fissure, joining the fibres continued from the anterior column of the cord ; and as the inner fibres of each pyramid are derived from the opposite side, they cross each other in the median line—forming thus the decussation of the medulla oblongata. The fibres of the pyramid are white and longitudinal, and are collected into a bundle of a prismatic form. Superiorly they enter the pons (fig. 56), to reach the cerebrum. Dissection.

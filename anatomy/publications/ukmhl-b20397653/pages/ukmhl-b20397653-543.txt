DIAPHRAGM AND ITS ACTIOX. 529 alternate with like parts of the transversalis muscle ; but a slight intervals in interval separates the slips to the xiphoid cartilage and seventh rib, the muscle- and a second space exists sometimes between the fibres from the last rib and the arch over the quadratus lumborum muscle. In it Apertures. are certain apertures for the transmission of things from the thorax to the abdomen. The muscle is convex towards the chest, and concave to the Arch, abdomen. Its arch reaches higher on the right than the left side Fig. 168 * (p. 327), and is constantly varying during life in respiration. In forced expiration the muscle ascends, and reaches as high as the Height in upper border of the right fourth rib at the sternum, and the upper eviration edge of the fifth rib on the left side, close to the sternum. In forced inspiration it descends, and its slope would be represented ^j^spi" by a line drawn from the middle of the ensiform cartilage to the eleventh rib. Action. As the muscle moves up and down during respiration, it is JJpj^tion depressed by the contraction of the fleshy fibres which are attached to the ribs and spine ; and it is raised during their relaxation. When the diaphragm descends it changes its shape. The central ?°s1^"iou tendon, which moves but slightly, remains the highest point of the arch, whilst the sides winch contract freely are sloped from the tendon to the wall of the thorax. During the ascent the midriff and in i n n . « , , i expiration. retains nearJy the same form as m a state of rest, for the tendon is * Under surface of the diaphragm, a. Diaphragm, b.

DISSECTION OF THE ORBIT. 44 the superior rectus and levator palpebral muscles, and lies afterwards below the superior oblique ; in this part of its course it furnishes the following branches :— Branches. The branch to the lenticular ganglion (5) is about half an inch long lentfcuiar °f anc^ veiT lender, and arises as soon as the nerve comes into the orbit: ganglion. this is the long root of the lenticular ganglion. Long ciliary Long ciliary branches. As the nasal crosses the optic nerve, it L ' supplies two or more ciliary branches (fig. 11) to the eyeball. Fig. 11.* Infra-troch- lear branch. These lie on the inner side of the optic, and join the ciliary branches of the lenticular ganglion. The infra-trochlear branch (*2) arises as the nasal nerve is about to leave the cavity, and is directed forwards below the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, to end in the upper eyelid, the con- junctiva, and the side of the nose. Before this branch leaves the orbit it receives an offset of communication from the supra-troch- lear nerve. * Second view of the orbit (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles:— a.

The upper six lie between the ribs, and are confined upper six to the wall of the thorax ; whilst the lower six are prolonged into gp^^ the abdominal wall, where the ribs cease in front. Upper six. At first the nerves lie between the pleura and sub- Connec- jacent fascia and the external intercostal muscle, with an artery and mu^ie? vein ; but they enter soon between the intercostals, and extend forwards to the middle line. Near the head of the rib each is joined by filaments from the sympathetic. In its course each supplies witn. sympa- branches to the intercostals and the ribs ; and cutaneous offsets to the surface, which are described in the dissections of the upper Offsets. limb (p. 238), and wall of the abdomen (p. 438). There are some deviations in the first and second nerves from the Exceptions r i «r» l in first two. arrangement above specmed. The^rs^ nerve ascends in front of the neck of the highest rib, ^j[g*snerve and ends in the brachial plexus. Before it leaves the chest it mostly bra- supplies to the first intercostal space a branch, which furnishes cnialPlexus- muscular offsets, and becomes cutaneous by the side of the sternum. There is not any lateral cutaneous offset from this branch, except when the second nerve is not as large as usual. The second nerve may extend a considerable way on the wall of Second the chest before entering between the intercostal muscles, and may ascend even to the first space. It is remarkable in having a very large lateral cutaneous branch (p. 238). In front it ends like the others. Upper surface of the diaphragm. The centre of the muscle is ^^Qrfsur" tendinous, and the sides are fleshy. In contact with the upper diaphragm, surface are the lungs laterally, and the pericardium in the middle : the phrenic vessels and nerves pierce this surface, external to the Parts pericardium. In the diaphragm are the following apertures :—one 1 &' for the oesophagus and the pneumogastric nerves, a second for the in it. vena cava, a third for the aorta with the thoracic duct and the large vena azygos, and a fourth on each side for the splanchnic nerves. Beneath it the sympathetic passes into the abdomen. The arch of the diaphragm towards the thorax has been before Curve, referred to (p. 327). Directions.

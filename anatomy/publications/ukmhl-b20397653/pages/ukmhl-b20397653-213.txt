Each is about three- quarters of an inch long, and widens as it approaches the cerebrum. Crossing its outer surface is the optic tract; and between the crura of opposite sides is the interpeduncular space, which contains the locus perforatus, the corpora albicantia, and the tuber cinereum. Structure. The peduncle consists of longitudinal fibres, continuous ^^te^?*, with the longitudinal fibres of the pons, which enclose here a mass fibres, of gray matter between them. Fig. 59* Dissection. For the purpose of showing the structure of the crus, Dissection, on the right side (fig. 57), the optic tract should be divided, and the fibres continuous with the anterior pyramid of the medulla oblongata should be raised as far into the crus as the optic thalamus.

571 ANATOMY OF VESICULA SBMINALIS. Bloodvessels. The arteries are ratlier small, and are furnished by Arteries, the inferior vesical and middle hemorrhoidal (p. 563). The veins form a plexus around the gland,4 which communicates in front with Veins form the dorsal vein of the penis, and behind with the venous plexus at a i>lexus- the base of the bladder. In old men this vascular intercommuni- cation gives rise to considerable haemorrhage in the operation of lithotomy. The nerves are supplied by the hypogastric plexus. The lymphatics Nerves, of this body and of the vesiculse seminales are received into the Lymphatics, glands by the side of the internal iliac artery. VesiculjE Seminales (fig. 17G, e). These vesicles are two mem- Seminal branous sacs, which secrete a fluid to mix with the semen. They Cb b * Fig. 176.* are placed on the under surface of the bladder behind the prostate, definition, and diverge from one another so as to limit laterally a triangular situation, space in that situation : their form and connections have been already described (p. 554). Though sacculated and bulged behind, sacculated. the vesicula becomes straight and narrowed in front (duct) ; and at the base of the prostate it blends with the vas deferens to form the common seminal or ejaculatory duct (g). The vesicula seminalis* consists, like the epididymis, of a tube Formed of a bent into a zigzag form, so as to produce lateral sacs or pouches culle,i tllbe: * View of the under surface of the bladder with the vesicula? seminales and vasa deferentia (slightly altered from Haller). a.

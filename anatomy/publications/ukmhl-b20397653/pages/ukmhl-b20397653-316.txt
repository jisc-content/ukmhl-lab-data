DISSECTION OF BACK OF FOREARM. 302 origin, insertion. Connec- tions. Fig. Is the guide to the radial artery. Use, radius free and fixed. Extensor carpi longus. muscle arises from the upper two-thirds of the outer condyloid ridge of the humerus, and the front of the external intermuscular septum. The fleshy fibres end about the middle of the forearm in a tendon, which is inserted into the lower end of the radius, close above the styloid process. In the arm the margins of the supinator are directed towards the surface and the bone, but in the forearm the muscle is flattened over the others, with its edges forwards and backwards. Its an- terior border touches the biceps and the pronator teres; and the posterior is in contact with both radial extensors of the wrist. Near its insertion the supinator is covered by two extensors of the thumb. Beneath the muscle are the brachialis anticus and mus- culo-spiral nerve, the extensors of the wrist, the radial vessels and nerve, and the radius. Action. The chief use of this supinator is to bend the elbow joint. But if the radius is either forcibly pronated or supinated the muscle can put the hand into a state intermediate between pro- nation and supination,â€”the thumb being brought above the fore- finger. If the radius is fixed as in climbing, the muscle will bring up the humerus, bending the elbow. The EXTENSOR CARPI RADIALIS longior, B, arises from the lower third of the outer condyloid ridge of the humerus, and the front of the contiguous intermuscular sep- tum ; and from the septum be- tween it and the next muscle. The muscle lies on the short radial extensor, being partly covered by the supinator longus ; and its tendon passes beneath the extensors of the thumb, and * Superficial layer of muscles on the back of the forearm, with some vessels.

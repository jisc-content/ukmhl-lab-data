289 ANTERIOR INTEROSSEOUS VESSELS. the pronator quadratus. At that spot the artery turns from the front to the back of the limb, and descends to the back of the carpus, where it ends by anastomosing with the posterior interosseous and carpal arteries. Branches. Numerous offsets are given to the contiguous muscles. Muscular j| One long branch (/), median, accompanies the median nerve, J^^f" j supplying it, and either ends in the flexor sublimis, or extends beneath the annular ligament to the palmar arch. About the middle of the forearm two nutrient vessels of the nutrient to -i • n 1 • - n .i , " the bones radius and ulna arise irom the artery. Where it is about to pass through the interosseous membrane and the it furnishes twigs to the pronator quadratus ; and one branch is carpus* continued beneath that muscle to anastomose with the anterior carpal arteries. The anterior interosseous nerve is derived from the median (fig. Anterior 81,2), and accompanies the artery of the same name to the pronator nerveeMs18 quadratus muscle, the under surface of which it enters. Some in pronator, lateral branches are distributed by it to the deep flexor muscles. Dissection. The attachment of the biceps and brachialis anticus to Dissection, the bones of the forearm may be now cleaned and examined. The insertion of the brachialis anticus takes place by a broad insertion of thick tendon, about an inch in length, which is fixed into the coro- antiCus. noid process of the ulna, except at the inner edge ; and into the contiguous rough part of the bone. Insertion of the biceps. The tendon of the biceps is inserted into insertion of the inner part of the tubercle of the radius, and slightly into the tlie blceps* bone behind it. A bursa intervenes between it and the front of the tubercle. At its attachment the anterior surface becomes ex- ternal ; and the opposite. The supinator brevis muscle partly sur- rounds the insertion. Section V. THE PALM OF THE HAND. Dissection (fig. 83). The digits being separated and fixed firmly Dissection, with tacks, the skin is to be reflected from the palm of the hand by means of two incisions. One is to be carried along the centre Seek the from the wrist to the fingers ; and the other is to be made from side nerves, to side, at the termination of the first. In raising the inner flap, the small palmaris brevis muscle will be seen at the inner margin and muscle, of the hand ; and its insertion into the skin,may be left till the muscle has been'learnt. In the fat the ramifications of the small branches (palmar) of the median and ulnar nerves are to be traced. The student should remove the fat from the palmaris muscle, and Define the from the strong palmar fascia in the centre of the hand ; and he fascia^ should take care not to destroy a transverse fibrous band (transverse ligament) which lies across the roots of the fingers.

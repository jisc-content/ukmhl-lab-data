PKEFACE. The plan of this work is designed to teach the Anatomy of the Human Body by dissection in successive stages after the following manner :â€” In the dissection of a Part of the Body the attention of the Student is directed first to the superficial prominences of bone and muscle, and to the hollows that point out the situation of the subjacent vessels. Next the cutaneous structures, and the different layers of muscles with their appertaining vessels and nerves are examined in succession, so that the several objects between the surface and the bones may be observed in much the same order as they would be met with in a Surgical operation. And, lastly, the joints and ligaments receive due notice. In the dissection also of the viscera and the organs of the senses the manner in which the composition of each may be shown, is fully indicated for the guidance of the Student. The Anatomical description of the Part under examination is arranged in conformity with the "dissection in regions, and each muscle, bloodvessel, nerve, or other structure, is described only to such an extent as it may be laid bare.

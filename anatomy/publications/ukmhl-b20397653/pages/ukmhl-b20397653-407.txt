COMPLEXUS MUSCLE. outwards nearly two inches from the occipital crest towards the trachelo-mastoideus. The inner part of the complexus having two fleshy bellies with ^e^r an intervening tendon, is described often as a separate muscle with the name biventer cervicis. The complexus is concealed by the splenius and trapezius : and £°™ec~ Fig. 118.* the cutaneous surface is marked by a tendinous cross intersection towards the upper end. Two or three of the cervical nerves per- forate it. Along the inner side is the semispinalis muscle, with the ligamentum nucha;.

One Use- will draw the occiput down and back towards its own side. Dissection of vessels and nerves (fig. 119). In the neck the nerves ^he^10 and vessels will be brought into view by detaching the complexus nerves of the neck * Dissection of the muscles underneath the splenius. A. Longus colli. b.

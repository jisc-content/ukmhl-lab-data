The inner end of the clavicle can be moved up and Motion, down, and forwards and backwards, and the direction it takes is fourwa2 Fig. 61.* the opposite to that of the limb and the shoulder. Thus when the limb is depressed the sternal end of the clavicle is raised ; and if the arm is elevated, the inner end of that bone will be lowered. When the shoulder is forced back the collar bone moves forwards at the sternum ; and the inner end of that bone will project back when the shoulder is impelled forwards. The extent of each move- ment is but limited, though those forwards and upwards are the freest ; and dislocation may ensue in any direction, except down- wards. * Ligaments of the inner end of the clavicle, and of the cartilage of the second rib. 1.

181 ARTERIES OF THE BRAIN. site the foramen magnum, and ramifies in the dura mater lining the fossa of the occipital bone. d. The inferior cerebellar artery (posterior 10) is distributed to Branci^to the under surface of the cerebellum. Taking origin from the end part of of the vertebral, this branch winds backwards round the medulla, cerebellum: between the pneumo-gastric and spinal accessory nerves, to the Fig. 52*. median fissure of the cerebellum. Directed onwards along the fissure the artery reaches the upper surface of the small brain, ■and there anastomoses with the superior cerebellar artery. An offset of this branch ramifies over the under part of the offyet»- cerebellum, and ends externally by anastomosing with the artery of the upper surface. As the vessel lies by the side of the aperture of the fourth ventricle it gives a small choroid twig to the plexus of that cavity. The basilar artery (n), formed by the union of the two verte- Basilar brals, reaches from the lower to the upper border of the pons, artery- where it ends by dividing into two branches (posterior cerebral) for the cerebrum. The vessel touches the basilar process of the situation, occipital bone, from that circumstance receiving its name, and lies in the median groove of the pons. On each side of, and almost parallel to it is the sixth nerve. Branches. Besides the two terminal branches mentioned above, Branches: the artery supplies transverse offsets to the pons and the under part of the cerebellum, and a large branch to the upper surface of the cerebellum. * Arteries at the base of the brain. 1.

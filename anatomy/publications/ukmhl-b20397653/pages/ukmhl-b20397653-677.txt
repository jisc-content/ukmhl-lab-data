MOVEMENTS OF HIP JOINT. 663 except opposite the cotyloid notch, and touches the head of the cartiiagin- femur by this part: this articular surface is deep above, but Â°aiiyXtei" gradually decreases towards the notch. Within the cartilage and close to the notch, is a mass of fat Fat in the (fig. 189,/) covering about one third of the area of the cotyloid bottom- Fig. 204.* cavity, which constitutes the gland of Havers : it communicates ' with the fat of the thigh beneath the transverse ligament. Movement. In this ball and socket joint, there are the same kinds Kinds of of movement as in the shoulder, viz., flexion and extension, abduc- motlon- tion and adduction, circumduction, and rotation. Flexion and extension. In the swinging movement flexion is freer Swinging than extension, the thigh being capable of such elevation as to touch movement : the belly. During swinging the head of the femur revolves in the bottom motion of of the acetabulum, rotating around a line corresponding with the axis of the head and neck; and the rapidity and extent of the movements do not endanger the security of the joint, the head of the bone not having any tendency to escape. In flexion, the back of the capsule and the ilio-trochanteric band state of are put on the stretch ; and in extension, the strong ilio and pubio- 8 femoral bands are tightened. In abduction and adduction the femur is removed from, or brought Lateral movement: * Hip joint opened, to show the interarticular or round ligament, a. Part of the capsule, b.

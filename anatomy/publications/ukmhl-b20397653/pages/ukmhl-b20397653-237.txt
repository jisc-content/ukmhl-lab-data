SURFACES OF CEREBELLUM. 2*23 of the base of the skull, beneath the tentorium cerebelli. Like the cerebrum, it is incompletely divided into two hemispheres ;—the division being marked by a wide median groove along the under surface, and by a notch at the posterior border which receives the f alx cerebelli. Upper Surface. On the upper aspect the cerebellum is raised in the centre (fig. 68), but sloped towards the circumference. There is not any median sulcus on this surface; and the halves are united by a central constricted part,—the superior vermiform process. Separating the upper from the under surface, at the circumference, is the horizontal fissure, which is wide in front, and extends back- wards from the pons Varolii to the middle line of the cerebellum. The under surface is convex, being received into the fossae of Fig. 66.* position of cerebellum. Division into two. No groove on the upper surface ; halves joined. Horizontal fissure. A hollow- below, the base of the skull, and is divided into hemispheres (fig. 66) by a median hollow (vallecula). The central fissure, or the vallecula, is wider at the middle than at which is either the anterior or the posterior end, and receives the medulla valley and oblongata. In the bottom of the fissure is a mass named inferior contains vermiform process (fig. 66, c to e), which corresponds with the vermiform central part connecting the halves of the cerebellum on the upper process" surface. The two vermiform processes constitute the general com- missure of the halves of the cerebellum. Constituents of the vermiform process. In the inferior vermiform Constituents process are the following eminences, which may be easily separated \ * Under part of the cerebellum, seen from behind, the medulla oblongata, b, "being cut away in greater part. a.

VELUM INTERPOSITUM. 215 opening into the lateral ventricle is bounded by the edge of the and readies fornix on the one side, and by the optic thalamus and cms cerebri j^inÂ°f on the other. A piece of pia mater projects into the transverse Pia mater fissure, forming a horizontal central piece, velum interpositum, enters it. beneath the fornix (fig. 64,g); and thinner lateral pieces with terminal fringes in the lateral ventricles (/). But the slit through which the membrane enters the ventricle is closed by the lining structure of that cavity being continued on the intruded part. Fig. 64.* Parts in the Middle Line of Cerebrum. The student is now Parts in the to return to the examination of the parts in the centre of the brain, j^e brain. viz., the fold of pia mater and its vessels, with the third ventricle. At the same time the optic thalamus is to be seen. The velum interpositum (fig. 64, g) is the central portion of the Veimn, or fold of pia mater entering the great transverse fissure. Triangular ^ater, PUL in shape, it has the same extent as the body of the fornix, and reaches in front to the foramen of Monro.

LIGAMENTS OF HIP JOINT. 661 of the swinging movement which would result from their insertion use. into the hinder part of the neck. Posteriorly the joint is covered by the external rotator muscles ; Muscles and anteriorly by the psoas and iliacus, a bursa being between it around* and them. Above is the gluteus minimus, whose tendon is united with the upper and outer band of the capsule; and below is the obturator externus. Dissection (fig. 204). The capsular ligament is to be now divided Cut open over the prominence of the head of the femur, and this bone being the capsule- disarticulated but not detached, the cotyloid and interarticular liga- ments inside it will appear. The interarticular or round ligament is attached to the acetabulum n^ment!^1 by two pieces ; and to bring these into view, the synovial membrane and areolar tissue must be removed. The transverse ligament over the notch is also to be defined. The cotyloid ligament (fig. 189, g) is a narrow band of fibro- lament cartilage, which is fixed to the margin of the acetabulum, and is prolonged across the notch on the inner side, so as to form part of the transverse ligament. Its fibres are not continued around the attached f â–  ^ around acetabulum, but are fixed to the margin of the cavity, and cross acetabulum. one another in the band. It is thickest at its attachment to the * Hinder part of the hip-joint capsule, a. Longitudinal fibres, b. Trans- verse band. c. Thin piece attached to the neck of the femur about half way- down.

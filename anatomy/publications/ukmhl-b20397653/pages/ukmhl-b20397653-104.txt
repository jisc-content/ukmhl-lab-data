Sd DISSECTION OF THE PTERYGOID REGION. Directions. Should the internal maxillary artery obstruct the view of the nerve, it may be cut through. The smaller part, formed mainly by its contribution from the trunk of the nerve, receives nearly all the fibrils of the motor root, and ends in branches for the muscles of the jaw, viz. temporal, masseter, and one pterygoid ; and for the muscle of the cheek, the buccinator. The deep temporal tranches (3) are furnished to the under surface of the temporal muscle. Like the arteries, they are two in number, Fig. 21.* anterior and posterior, and course upwards beneath the external pterygoid muscle. The posterior branch is the smallest, and is often derived from the masseteric nerve ; it is placed near the back of the temporal fossa. The anterior branch supplies the greater part of the muscle, and communicates sometimes with the buccal nerve. The masseteric branch (2) takes a backward course above the external pterygoid muscle, and through the sigmoid notch, to the under surface of the masseter muscle : in the masseter the nerve can be followed to near the interior border. As this branch passes by the articulation of the jaw it gives one or more twigs to that joint. * Deep view of the pterygoid region (Illustrations of Dissections). Muscles : A. Temporal reflected, b. Condyle of the jaw disarticulated, with the external pterygoid attached to it. c. Internal pterygoid. D. Buccinator. F. Masseter thrown down. Nerves : 1. Buccal. 2. Masseteric, cut. 3. Deep temporal. 4. Auriculotemporal. 6. Chorda tympani. 7. Inferior dental. 8. Gusta- tory. 10. Internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. The arteries are not figured, with the exception of the internal maxillary trunk which is marked with 9 : the offsets of the artery accompany the nerves, being named like them. Muscular piece supplies two temporal; posterior •and -■anterior. Masseteric. Articular.

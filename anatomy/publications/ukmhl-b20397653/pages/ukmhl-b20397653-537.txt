CHARACTERS OF TESTIS. 523 Tunica vaginalis partly covers the testicle, upper part, and inflate it. The sac and the spermatic cord are then to be cleaned; and the vessels of the latter are to be followed to their entrance into the testicle. The tunica vaginalis (fig. 166, d) is a serous bag, which is con- tinuous in the fetus with the peritoneal lining of the abdomen, but becomes subsequently a distinct sac through the obliteration of the part connecting the two (p. 452). It invests the testicle after the manner of other serous membranes ; for the testicle is placed behind it, so as to be partly enveloped by it. The sac, however, is larger than is necessary for covering the testicle, and projects some distance above it. Like other serous membranes, it has an ex- ternal rough, and an internal secerning smooth surface ; and like them it has a visceral and a parietal part. To examine its disposition the sac should be opened. The visceral . layer (tunica vaginalis testis) covers the testicle, except posteriori}r where the vessels lie. On the outer side it extends farther back than on the inner, and forms a pouch between the testis and the arched body (epididymis) on this aspect of the organ. The parietal part of the sac (tunic, vagin. scroti) is more extensive than the piece covering the testicle, and lines the contiguous layer of the scrotum. Form and position of the testis (fig. 166). The testicle is oval in shape, with a smooth surface, and is flattened on the sides. The anterior margin is convex ; and the pos- terior, which is flattened, is pierced by the spermatic vessels and nerves. Stretching like an arch along the outer side is the epididymis (b). Attached to the upper end of the testis is a small body (c) two or three lines in length, (corpus Mor- gagni,) which is the remains of the upper end of the fetal duct of Miiller ; and occasionally other smaller projections of the tunica vaginalis are connected with the top of the epididymis. The testis is suspended obliquely, so that the upper part is directed Suspended forwards and somewhat outwards, and the lower end backwards and obll,iuel*v- rather inwards. Size and vjeight The length of the testis is an inch and a half or Dimensions, two inches ; from before backwards it measures rather more than an inch, and from side to side rather less than an inch.

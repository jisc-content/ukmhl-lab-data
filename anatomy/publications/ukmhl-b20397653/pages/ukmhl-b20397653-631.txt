617 SCAEPA'S TRIANGULAR SPACE. ral vessels are to be followed downwards as far as the sartorius muscle. On the outer side of the vessels clean the divisions of the seek nerve anterior crural nerve, together with the branches of an artery (pro- funda), which are buried in the fat. In removing the fat from be- takeaway neath the femoral artery, the student is to look for one or two small fat* nerves to the pectineus muscle. This intermuscular space (fig. 193) contains the trunks of the blood- Contents, vessels of the thigh, and the anterior crural nerve, with lymphatics Fig. 193.* and fat. It measures commonly three inches from above down ; but extent, the length varies with the breadth of the sartorius, and the height at which this muscle crosses inwards. * Dissection of Scarpa's triangular space (Illustrations of Dissections) Muscles: a.

293 MEDIAN NERVE AND BRANCHES. of the short flexor, and ends in the abductor and opponens pollicis muscles. b. The digital nerves (5) are five in number. Three of them, Five digital which are distributed to the sides of the thumb and the radial side of the fore finger, are undivided, and come from the external of the two pieces into which the trunk of the median splits. The Fig. 83.* other two spring from the inner piece of the nerve, and are bifur- cated to supply the opposed sides of the middle and fore, and the middle and ring fingers. The first tivo nerves belong to the thumb, one being on each side First two, and the most external is said to communicate with branches of the radial nerve.

718 DISSECTION OF THE LEG. lateral motion: circular motion limited. Union of the phalanges, synovial sac. Form of bones. Kind of motion, movement of hone, state of ligaments. and the hinder part of each lateral ligament, and by the flexor tendons. Lateral movement. The phalanx passes from side to side across the end of the metatarsal bone. Its motion is checked by the lateral ligament of the side from which it moved, and by the contact with the other digits. Circumduction, or the revolving of the phalanx over the rounded head of the metatarsal bone, is least impeded in the great toe joint; but these movements in the foot are not so free as in the hand. Articulations of the phalanges. There are two phalangeal joints to each toe, except the first. Ligaments similar to those in the metatarso-phalangeal joints, viz., two lateral and an inferior, are to be recognised in these articula- tions. The joint between the last two phalanges is least distinct; and oftentimes the small bones are immoveably united by osseous substance. These ligaments receive a more particular notice with the dissection of the hand (p. 323). A simple synovial membrane exists in each phalangeal articulation. Articular surfaces. In both phalangeal joints, the nearest phalanx presents a trochlear surface ; and the distal one is marked by two lateral hollows or cups with a median ridge. Movement. Only flexion and extension are permitted in the two phalangeal joints of the toes, as in the hand. In flexion the farther phalanx glides under the nearer ; and in extension the two are brought into a straight line. The bending is checked by the lateral ligaments and the extensor tendon ; and the straightening is limited by the inferior ligament and the flexor tendons.

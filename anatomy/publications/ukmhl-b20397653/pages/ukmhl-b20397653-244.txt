230 DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. nucleus of the sixth • and facial. of the ventricle. Its lining and epithe- lium. Choroid plexus of the cavity. Gray matter forms sur- face stratum. Special rounded elevation on the outer part of the eminentia teres, about a line above the white cross strige on the floor, and close behind the fovea anterior. The fourth ventricle communicates at the upper end with the third ventricle through the Sylvian aqueduct; and with the sub- arachnoid space of the cord and brain, through an aperture in the pia mater intervening between the medulla and the cerebellum : laterally, the ventricular space is extended for a short distance be- tween the cerebellum and the side of the medulla oblongata. The lining of the other ventricles is prolonged into this by the aperture of communication with the third. Covering the floor is a columnar epithelium, which is continuous with that in the upper part of the central canal of the spinal cord (Clarke). In this ventricle is a vascular fold—choroid plexus, on each side, similar to the body of the same name in the other ventricles. It is attached to the inner surface of the membrane (pia mater) which closes the ventricle between the medulla and the cerebellum, and it extends upwards on the side of the opening into the sub- arachnoid space. Its vessels are supplied by the inferior cerebellar artery. Gray matter of fourth ventricle. The gray matter forms a sur- face-covering for the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is continuous below with the gray commissure of the cord, and extends upwards to the aqueduct of Sylvius (p. 195). The special nuclei have been referred to already (p. 229).

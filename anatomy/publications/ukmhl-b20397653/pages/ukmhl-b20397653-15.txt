DEMONSTRATIONS OF ANATOMY. CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Section I. EXTERNAL PARTS OF THE HEAD. Directions. In the dissection of the head and neck, the student Parts to be should endeavour to learn the parts described in the first fifty- the body is eight pages, before the position of the body is changed ; but if turned- want of time necessitates an omission of some part, the examina- tion of the facial nerve (p. 35) can be best deferred till a subse- quent stage. The exterior and the interior of the head, the orbit on one side, and the posterior triangular space on both sides of the neck, should be examined whilst the body lies in its first position on the Back. The student begins with the dissection of the muscles of the scalp and ear. On the left side the muscles are to be seen, and on the opposite half the vessels and nerves are to be displayed. Position. The body lying on the Back, raise the head to a suitable J^e Sody°f height, and turn the face to the right side. Exteinsic muscles of the Ear. Three muscles attach the ear Muscles of to the side of the head. Two are above it,—one elevating, the the ear* other drawing it forwards ; and the third, a retrahent muscle, is behind the ear. There are other special or intrinsic muscles of the cartilage of the ear, which will be afterwards noticed, p. 34. Dissection. When the ear has been drawn down by hooks, the Dissection position of the upper muscle will be indicated by a slight pro- muscFesj minence between it and the head ; and the muscular fibres may be laid bare by means of the two following incisions, made no deeper than the skin ;—One is to be carried upwards on the side of the head, for about three inches, along the cutaneous ridge before mentioned ; and the other, about the same length, is to be directed from before backwards close above the ear, so that the two may join at a right angle. On carefully raising the flaps of skin from below

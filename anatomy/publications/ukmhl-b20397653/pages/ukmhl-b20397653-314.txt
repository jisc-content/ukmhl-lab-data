DISSECTION OF THE HAND. 300 carpal bones between which they lie. The dorsal muscles are thus allotted to the digits :—two belong to the second finger, a third is connected with the radial side of the fore, and the fourth with the ulnar side of the ring finger. Action. They help to bend the metacarpophalangeal joints by their attachment to the first phalanx ; and will assist in the extension Fig. 85.* Fig. 86. t of the two last phalangeal joints through their union with the extensor tendon. as abductors Further, the interossei can separate and approximate the straight- tors.addUC" ened fingers :—thus the palmar set adduct to the second finger ; and the dorsal abduct from the middle line of the second finger— the two fixed to this digit moving it to the right and left of that line. Dissection. Dissection. The attachments of the annular ligament to the carpal bones on each side are to be next dissected out by taking away the small muscles of the thumb and little finger. Before reading its description, the ends of the cut ligament may be placed in appo- sition, and fixed with a stitch. Annular The anterior annular ligament is a firm ligamentous band, which front o? °f arcnes over and binds down the flexor tendons of the fingers. It wrist is attached externally to the front of the os scaphoides, and to the fore and inner parts, and ridge of the os trapezium ; and internally to the unciform and pisiform bones. By its upper border it is con- nected with the aponeurosis of the forearm ; and by its anterior surface it is joined by the palmar fascia. On it lie the palmaris longus and the ulnar artery and nerve. * Three palmar interosseous muscles, a.

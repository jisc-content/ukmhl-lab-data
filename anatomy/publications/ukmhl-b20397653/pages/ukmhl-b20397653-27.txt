SINUSES OF CKxVNIUM. of which it gives a small slip. In it is contained the occipital sinus. sinus. The sinuses are venous spaces between the layers of the dura Smuses^of mater, into which blood is received. All the sinuses open either into a large space named torcular Herophili, opposite the occipital protuberance; or into the two cavernous sinuses on the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone. A. The torcular Herophili (fig. 3, a) is placed in the tentorium, o^ipitai opposite the centre of the occipital bone. It is of an irregular Fig. 3.* shape, and numerous sinuses open into it, viz., the superior longi- tudinal above, and the occipital below ; the straight in front, and the lateral sinus on each side. The superior longitudinal sinus has been already described (see Superior P. io). _ and The inferior longitudinal sinus (fig. 3, c) resembles a small vein, inferior ion- and is contained in the lower border of the falx cerebri at the & posterior part. This vein receives blood from the falx and the larger brain, and ends in the straight sinus (d) at the edge of the tentorium. The straight sinus (fig. 3, d) lies along the middle of the ten- straight, torium, and seems to continue the preceding sinus to the common point of union. Its form is triangular, like the superior longi- tudinal. Joining it are the inferior longitudinal sinus, the veins of Galen from the interior of the large brain,-and some small veins from the upper surface of the cerebellum. The occipital sinus (fig. 3, g) is a small space in the falx cere- Occipital belli, which reaches to the foramen magnum, and collects the blood smus* from the occipital fossas. This sinus may be double. The lateral sinus (fig. 3, e) is the channel by which most of the Lateral sinus, * Some of the sinuses of the skull, a. Torcular Herophili. b.

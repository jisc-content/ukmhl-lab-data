375 INTERVERTEBRAL SUBSTANCE. X (fig. 111). This disposition of the fibres will be best seen on the discs between the lumbar vertebras ; and it may be rendered evident by dissecting layer after layer. Fig. 111.* Fig. 112f. The central or pulpy portion of the disc (fig. 113, b) is very Inner part soft and elastic, and projects when two vertebras and the interposed mass are sawn through. Placed nearer the back than the front of situation, the disc, it is more marked in the loins and neck than in the dorsal where region. It has a yellowish colour, and is deficient in the stratiform larges*» arrangement so conspicuous at the circumference. Towards the confine of the two portions of the intervertebral substance, there is an alternating arrangement of fibrous tissue and fibro-cartilage, though the former is gradually diminishing; but to- wards the centre a loose fibro- cartilaginous material with large cells preponderates. The surfaces of the vertebras in contact with the disc, have a cartilaginous covering ; this may be seen by cutting the inter- vertebral substance from the bone. Over the centre of the osseous surface it forms a continuous layer, but towards the circumference it consists of separate pieces.

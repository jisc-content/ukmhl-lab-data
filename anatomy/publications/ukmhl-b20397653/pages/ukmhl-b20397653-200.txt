DISSECTION OF THE BRAIN. 186 Origin from cerebrum. Tract of the nerve. The origin of the nerve will be afterwards seen to come from the optic thalamus and the corpora geniculata, and from one of the corpora quadrigemina (nates). The tract is the flattened part of the optic winding round the peduncle of the cerebrum. In front it ends in the commissure, and behind it splits into two pieces by which it is fixed to the brain. As the tract reaches forwards it crosses the crus cerebri, to which it is attached by its outer or anterior edge ; and in front of the crus it is placed between the substantia perforata antica on the outside, and the tuber cinereum on the inside, but whether it receives filaments from the latter is uncertain, its commis- The commissure (chiasma) of the nerves measures half an inch sure: across, and lies on the olivary eminence of the sphenoid bone, situation, within the circle of Willis. It is placed in front of the tuber cinereum ; and passing beneatli it (in this position of the brain) is the thin lamina cinerea. arrangement In the commissure each tract is resolved into three sets of fibres of fibres. with the following arrangement :â€”The outer fibres, few in number, are continued straight to the eyeball of the same side.

Trigeminal with small and large root. 6. Abductor oculi. 7. Facial and auditory, the former smaller and internal. 8.

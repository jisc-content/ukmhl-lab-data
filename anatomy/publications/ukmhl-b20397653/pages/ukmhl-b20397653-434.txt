At the anterior part, for a short distance, are two superficial perineal nerves (2) (of the pudic) ; and at the posterior part is a small branch of the fourth sacral nerve (3), with cutaneous offsets of the sciatic vessels (c) and nerve (4) bending round the gluteus. First cut m Into this, space the surgeon sinks his knife in the first incisions entersThis m the lateral operation of lithotomy ; and as he carries it from space. Fig. 129.* Muscles of rectum. Corrugator cutis. Attach- ments. before backwards, he will divide the superficial hemorrhoidal vessels and nerve. Muscles. Connected with the lower end of the rectum are four muscles, viz. a fine cuticular muscle, and two sphincters (external and internal) with the levator ani. Corrugator cutis ani f (fig. 129, B). This thin subcutaneous layer of involuntary muscle surrounds the anus with radiating fibres. Externally it blends with the subdermic tissue outside the internal sphincter ; and internally it enters the anus and ends in the sub- mucous tissue within the sphincter. * A view of the dissection of the rectal half of the perineum (Illustrations of Dissections).

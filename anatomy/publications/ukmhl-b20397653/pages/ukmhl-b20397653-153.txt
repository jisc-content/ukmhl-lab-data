OLFACTORY NERVE. 139 The olfactory nerve differs in structure from the other cranial Structure, nerves ; for its branches are deficient in the white substance of Schwann, and are nucleated and granular in texture. They resemble Fig. 33.* the ganglionic fibres : and seem to consist of an extension of the nerve substance of the olfactory bulb. The other nerves in the nose will be described in the following section. Blood vessels. For a statement of the different vessels of the nose, Biood-vesÂ« see p. 143. The arteries form a network in the pituitary membrane, sels of nose and a large submucous plexus on the edge of each of the two lower ai enes' spongy bones, especially on the inferior. The veins have a plexiform disposition like the arteries, and this is largest on the lower spongy veins, bone and the septum nasi. Section XIV. SPHENOPALATINE AND OTIC GANGLIA, FACIAL AND NASAL NERVES, AND FINAL BRANCHES OF THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY VESSELS. The preparation of Meckel's ganglion and its branches (fig. 34), Brandies of and of the terminal branches of the internal maxillary artery, is a ^J^^ difficult task, in consequence of the nerves and vessels being con- * Nerves of the septum of the nose. 1. Olfactory bulb and its raminca- cations on the septum. 2. Nasal nerve of the ophthalmic trunk. 3. Naso- palatine nerve from Meckel's ganglion (too large in the cut).

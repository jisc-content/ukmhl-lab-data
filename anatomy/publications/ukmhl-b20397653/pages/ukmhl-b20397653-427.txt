The lateral column is limited before and behind by the roots of the nerves. The posterior with its small posterior median segment, is placed between the posterior roots and the median fissure behind. Composition of the Cord (fig. 125). A horizontal section of the Cord con- medulla shows more distinctly its division into halves, with the Jn^white*7 commissural or connecting piece between them. The same cut matter, demonstrates the existence of a mass of gray matter in the interior, which is arranged in the form of two crescents (one in each half) united by a cross piece, and surrounded by white substance. The commissure (fie;. 125, li) consists of two parts, viz., a trans- The com- » . . missnre verse band of gray matter, with a white stratum in front. The gray transverse band (gray commissure) connects the The gray opposite crescents, and consists of nerve cells, and of transverse part' nerve fibres derived from the halves of the cord and the roots of the nerves. In its centre is the shrunken canal of the spinal cord (fig. 125, g), J^Jntral which is best seen in the fetus. It reaches the whole length of the medulla, and a cross section of the cord shows it as a round spot. Above, it opens on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and below it is continued into the filum terminale. It is lined by a columnar lined by ciliated epithelium ; and is obstructed by a granular material near ePltnellum- the upper opening (Clarke). The white piece of the commissure is formed partly by fibres of The wnite the anterior column ; and partly by fibrils of the anterior roots of part" the nerves, which here decussate as they cross from the one half to the other. It is best marked opposite the enlargements on the cord, and is least developed in the dorsal region. The half of the medulla. In the half of the cord, as in the com- half of missure, gray and white portions exist; the former is elongated from before back, being crescentic in shape as before said, and is quite surrounded by the latter. The gray crescent (g) is semilunar in form, with the horns or The cres- cornua of the crescent directed towards the roots of the nerves, cent' and the convexity to the middle line (fig. 125). The crescentic masses in the opposite halves of the cord are united by the gray commissure. The posterior cornu is long and slender (fig. 126, and reaches Posterior near the fissure along the attachment of the posterior nerve-roots. cornu' At its extremity, where it is slightly enlarged, it is encased with a rather transparent stratum of small nerve cells, which has been substantia named the substantia gelatinosa (fig. 126, 3). geiatinosa. The anterior cornu (fig. 126, 2) is shorter and thicker than the Anterior

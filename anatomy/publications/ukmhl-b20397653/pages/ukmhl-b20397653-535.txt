Its vessels and nerves are numerous, Nq duc"t but it is not provided with any excretory duct. One on each side, it is situate on the upper end, and the fore Situation, part of the kidney ; and without care it may be removed with the surrounding fat, which it resembles. Its colour is a brownish yellow. It is like a cocked hat in form, with the upper part convex, and the Form and base or lower part hollowed, where it touches the kidney. colour. In the adult it measures about one inch and a half in depth, and ^?rjâ„¢d rather less in width : and its weight is between one and two drachms, but the left is commonly larger than the right. Areolar tissue attaches the suprarenal body to the kidney; and Connec- large vessels and nerves retain it in place. The connections with the surrounding parts are the same as those of the upper end of the kidney. Thus it rests on the diaphragm on both sides ; whilst above the right is the liver, and above the left the pancreas and the spleen. On the inner side of the right capsule is the vena cava, with part of the solar plexus ; and internal to the left is the aorta, with the same plexus of nerves. Structure (fig. 165). A perpendicular section shows the suprarenal Two body to be formed of a firm or external (cortical) layer, and of an structures: internal (medullary) soft and dark material. With the microscope each has this body may be seen to consist of cells, which are lodged in spaces ^t^ae'lls formed by a stroma of areolar tissue, with vessels and nerves. The whole is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule (a), which sends Surrounded processes into the interior, and along the bloodvessels. capsule The cortical part, yellowish in colour and striated, makes about cortical two thirds of the thickness of the whole body. Its stroma of areolar Part- tissue (a) forms a thin surface layer, and is connected internally ^tissu^: with processes or septa, which are so arranged as to build up spaces forms elongated from without inwards, and arranged vertically around the siiaces centre ; but near the surface there are smaller oval spaces, some of them crossing the deeper and larger. The spaces or loculi (b) are for masses filled by columnar masses of cells, but slight force readily removes of cells- these from their containing hollows. The central or medullary portion (c) is rather red in colour, or it Medullary may be dark brown or black from the presence of blood. About part* half as thick as the cortical part, it possesses internally small round Tluckncss- or oval spaces, on a section, which are vein trunks cut across. The areolar tissue of its stroma is very fine, and forms a network with Spaces in it.

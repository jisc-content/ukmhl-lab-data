LOWER MESENTERIC VESSELS. 479 The mesenteric lymphatic glands are numerous between the layers Mesenteric of the mesentery. An upper group lies by the side of the artery, glands: and contains the largest glands ; and a lower group, near the in- testine , is lodged in the intervascular spaces. The chylif erous lymphatics vessels of the small intestine, and the absorbents of the part of then"ng the large intestine supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, pass through the mesenteric glands in their course to the thoracic duct. Fig. 142.* Along the side of the ascending and the transverse colon are a ^^"scolic few other small lymphatic glands meso-colic, which receive some & absorbents of the large intestine. Dissection (fig. 142). By drawing the small intestine over to the Dissection right side, the dissector will observe the inferior mesenteric artery mesenteric on the front of the aorta a little above the bifurcation. The peri- artery, toneum should be removed from its surface, and the branches should be traced outwards to the remaining half of the large intes- tine : a part of the artery enters the pelvis, but this will be dis- * The lower mesenteric artery, and the aorta, seen by turning aside the upper mesenteric artery and the small intestine (Tiedemann). a.

241 BOUNDARIES OF AXILLA. which are constructed by the muscles passing from the trunk to the upper limb. In the anterior fold are the two pectoral muscles, The pectoral but these take unequal shares in its construction, in consequence of f^t168111 the difference in their size and shape :—thus the pectoralis major A extends over the whole front of the space, reaching from the clavicle to the lower edge of the anterior fold ; whilst the pectoralis minor B, which is a narrow muscle, corresponds only with the middle third of the depth. In the posterior boundary, from above Fig. 69.* downwards, lie the subscapularis F, the latissimus dorsi muscle D, and the teres major e : this boundary reaches farther out than the and latissi- anterior, especially near the humerus ; and its free margin which ™ d%ut>7ca- is formed by the latissimus dorsi, projects forwards beyond the puiaris be- level of the subscapularis. On the inner side of the axilla lie the first four ribs, with their on the intervening intercostal muscles, and the part of the serratus magnus mner and c taking origin from those bones. On the outer side the space has outer sides. * View of the dissected axilla (Illustrations of Dissections.) Muscles : a. Pectoralis major, b. Pectoralis minor, c. Serratus magnus. d.

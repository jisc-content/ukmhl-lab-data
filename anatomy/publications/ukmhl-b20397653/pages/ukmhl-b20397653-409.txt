POSTERIOR CERVICAL NERVES. 395 neck and the head by the nerves that are superficial to the semi- some give spinalis ; these cutaneous offsets ascend to the surface through the offsets, splenius, the complexus, and the trapezius muscles, and are dis- tributed as before seen (p. 381). In their course the nerves supply Fig. 119.* the surrounding muscles, viz., complexus, semispinalis, multifidus spinge, and interspinales. The cutaneous branches of the second and third nerves reach the head, and require a separate notice.

Rectus posticus minor, c. Obliquus inferior, d. Obliquus superior. E. Splenius capitis. P. Complexus, cut across, g. Semispinalis colli. Arteries: a. Occipital, and b, its cervical branch, c. Vertebral artery, and d, its cervical branch, e. Deep cervical artery of the subclavian. Nerves : 1. Suboccipital nerve (posterior branch). 2. Inner piece of the posterior primary branch of the second nerve. 3. Inner piece of the third nerve. 4. Inner piece of the fourth. And the remaining figures point to the inner pieces of the respective nerves.

First lay bare the sphincter muscle of the eyelids by a skin-deep How to circular incision over the margin of the orbit, and by raising the skiiTft-om skin of the lids towards the aperture of the eye. Much care must muscle of . . eyelids be taken in detaching the skin from the thin, and oftentimes pale fibres of the orbicular muscle in the lids, else they will be cut away in consequence of the little areolar tissue between the two. Next the integument is to be removed from the side of the face fr0m the by one incision in front of the ear, from above the z}^gomatic arch face' to the angle of the jaw, and then along the base of the jaw to the chin ; and by another cut carried backwards horizontally from the corner of the mouth into the first. The flaps of skin are to be raised from behind forwards, and left adherent along the middle line. On the side of the nose the skin is closely united to the subjacent from the parts, and must be detached with caution. Around the mouth are Slde of nose> many fleshy slips extending both upwards and downwards from the orbicular muscle, but they are all marked so distinctly as to escape injury, with the exception of the small risorius muscle which goes from the corner of the mouth towards the ramus of the lower jaw. Whilst removing the fat from the muscles, each fleshy slip and around may be tightened with hooks. moutl1- The facial vessels and their branches will come into view as Facial the muscles are cleaned ; but the nerves may be disregarded on vessels this side. In front of the ear is the parotid gland, whose duct is to be and parotid preserved ; this is on a level with the meatus auditorius, and pierces slancL the middle of the cheek. Muscles of the Face (fig. 6). The superficial muscles of the face in the face are gathered around the apertures of the nose, eye, and mouth. An s^o1^168 orbicular or sphincter muscle encircles the apertures of the eye and the aper- mouth; and other muscles are blended with each to enlarge the uieh' opening in the centre of the fibres. There are three distinct groups of muscles : one of the eyelids ; another of the nostril ; and a third of the aperture of the mouth. One of the muscles of mastica- tion, viz. the masseter, is seen between the jaws. Muscles of the Nose. These muscles are the following : pyra- Muscles of midalis nasi, compressor naris, levator alas nasi, dilator naris, and nose- depressor alas nasi. The PYRAMIDALIS NASI (fig. 5, *) is a small fleshy slip that covers Pyramidalis the nasal bone, and is continuous above with the occipito-frontalis nabl" muscle. Over the cartilaginous part of the nose its fibres end in an aponeurosis, which joins that of the compressor naris. Along its inner border is the muscle of the opposite side. Action.

This muscle (fig. 5,3) is not well seen till Compressor after the examination of the following one. Triangular in shape, naris* it arises by its apex from the canine fossa of the upper maxillary

494 DISSECTION OF THE ABDOMEN. Thickness: disposition at pylorus. On the sur- face are pits or alveoli; their size, and appear- ance. The texture made up of tubules: The thickness of the mucous membrane is greatest near the pylorus ; and at that spot it forms a fold, opposite the muscular ring, which assists in closing the opening. If this membrane and its submucous layer are removed from the pyloric part of the stomach, the ring of muscular fibres (sphincter of the pylorus) will be more perfectly seen. Microscopic structure of the mucous membrane. With the aid of a lens, the surface of the mucous membrane, when well washed, may be seen to be covered by shallow depressions or alveoli (fig. 146), which measure from 2-5-oth to xJ"otn °^ an mcn across. Generally hexagonal or polygonal in outline, the hollows become larger and more elongated towards the small end of the stomach ; and near the pylorus the margins of the alveoli project, and become irre- gular. In the bottom of each depression are the apertures of minute tubes. By means of a thin section under the microscope the membrane may be observed to be composed almost altogether of minute Fig. 147. t vertical tubes, which lie side by side, and project into the submucous tissue. Measuring from -g^th to -^th of an inch in length, the tubes are closed at the deep end ; but they open on the surface of deep end ■ ^e s*omacn D0^n m *ne alve°li (%• 146) and in the interalveolar spaces. They are formed of a homogeneous membrane, and are for the most part straight, but towards the pylorus they increase in length, and are somewhat sacculated at the deep extremity ; some are divided into two or more pieces (fig. 147). lm*therum • ^ ^ne cai*diac extremity of the stomach the tubes are lined at the * Alveolar depressions of the mucous membrane of the stomach, magnified 32 diameters, with the minute tubes opening into them.

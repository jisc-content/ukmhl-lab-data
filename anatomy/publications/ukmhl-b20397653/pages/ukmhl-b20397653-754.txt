DISSECTION OF THE EAR. 740 outer end, extremity is dilated, and the posterior edge projects farther than the anterior ; the greater portion of the margin is rough, and gives at- inner end. tachment to the cartilage of the pinna. The inner end is smaller, and is marked in the dry bone by a groove for the insertion of the membrane of the tympanum ; it is so sloped that the anterior wall juts beyond the posterior by about two lines. Condition in In the fetus the osseous part of the meatus is absent. After birth the fetus. ft grows out of the osseous ring (tympanic bone) which supports the membrana tympani. membrane fining of the meatus. A prolongation of the integument lines of the skin. ^ne auditory passage, and is united more closely to the osseous than Fig. 236.* the cartilaginous portion; it is continued over the membrane of the tympanum in the form of a thin pellicle. At the entrance of the meatus are a few hairs. In the subcutaneous tissue over the carti- lage of the meatus lie some ceruminous glands of a yellow-brown colour, resembling in form and arrangement the sweat glands of the skin ; these secrete the ear wax, and open on the surface by separate orifices : they are absent in the osseous part, and are most abundant in that small portion of the tube which is formed by fibrous tissue. Vessels and nerves. The meatus receives its arteries from the pos- terior auricular, the internal maxillary, and the temporal branch of the external carotid (p. 80). Its nerves are derived from the auriculo- temporal branch of the fifth nerve, and enter the auditory passage between the bone and the cartilage (p. 91). * Vertical section of the meatus auditorius and tympanum (Scarpa), a.

408 DISSECTION OF THE SPINAL COED. Trunks of spinal nerves. Number and groups. Posterior larger than anterior; forms two "bundles that enter the ganglion. the posterior root into each point. The anterior root, consisting of two bundles of threads, is to be followed over the ganglion to its union with the posterior root beyond the ganglion. Spinal Nerves. There are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves ; and each nerve is constructed by the blending of two roots (anterior and posterior) in the intervertebral foramen (fig. 123). They are divided into groups corresponding with the regional subdivisions of the spinal column, viz., cervical, dorsal, lumbar., sacral, and coccygeal. In each group the nerves are the same in num- ber as the vertebras, except in the cervical region of the spine where they are eight, and in the coccygeal region where there is only one. In consequence of the number of nerves in the neck exceeding that of the vertebrae, the last is placed Fig. 123.* below the seventh vertebra ; and the lowest nerve of each group, except the coccygeal, will be below its corresponding vertebra. Each nerve divides into two primary branches, anterior and posterior, the former of these is distributed to the front of the body and the limbs, and the latter is confined to the hinder part of the trunk. Boots of the Nerves (fig. 123). Two roots (anterior and posterior) attach the nerve to the spinal cord ; and these unite together to form a common trunk in the inter- vertebral foramen. The posterior root is marked by a ganglion, but the anterior root is aganglionic. The posterior or ganglionic roots (fig. 123, h) surpass in size the anterior, and are formed by larger and more numerous fibrils. They are attached to the side of the cord between the posterior and lateral columns in a straight line, which they keep even to the last nerve. In their course to the trunk of the nerve the fibrils converge to an aperture in the dura mater, opposite the intervertebral foramen ; as they approach that aperture they are collected into two bundles (fig. 123 B, b) which, lying side by side, receive a sheath from * A.

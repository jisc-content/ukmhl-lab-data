FACIAL NERVE IN THE BONE. 145 being traced to it ; and the meatus auditorius is to be laid open, to see the facial and auditory nerves in that hollow. The course of the chorda tympani nerve (branch of the facial) across the tympanum will be brought into sight by the removal of the central ear bone, the incus. This nerve may be also followed to the facial through the wall of the cavity behind, as well as out of the cavity in front. The remaining branches of the facial nerve in the bone are very minute, and are not to be seen except on a fresh piece of the skull which has been softened in acid. The student may there- Fig. 35.* fore omit the paragraphs marked with an asterisk, till he is able to obtain a part on which a careful examination can be made. The facial nerve (fig. 35,l) is received into the internal auditory meatus, and entering the aqueduct of Fallopius at the bottom of that hollow, is conducted through the tem- poral bone to the stylo-mas- toid foramen and the face (p. 36). In its serpentine course through the bone, the nerve is first directed out- wards to the inner wall of the tympanum : at that spot it bends backwards, and is marked by a gangliform swelling (intumescentia gangliformis), to which several small nerves are united. From this swelling the nerve is continued through the arched aqueduct, to the aperture of exit from the bone. The branches of the nerve in the bone serve chiefly to connect it with other nerves ; but one supplies the tongue, and another the stapedius muscle. * Connecting branches communicate with the auditory and glosso- pharyngeal nerves ; and with two trunks (superior and inferior maxillary) of the fifth nerve. * Union with the auditory nerve. In the bottom of the meatus the facial and auditory nerves are connected by one or two minute filaments. * Connecting branches of the gangliform enlargement. The swelling of the facial nerve receives three small twigs. One in front is the large superficial petrosal nerve2 (vidian) ; another is the small super- ficial petrosal* of the tympanic nerve ; and the third is the external * Nerves joining the enlargement of the facial nerve. 1.

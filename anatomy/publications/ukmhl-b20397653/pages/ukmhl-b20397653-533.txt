519 BLOODVESSELS OF KIDNEY. of two vessels piercing the capsule, and is clothed with epithelium. One of the two, the afferent vessel (VZ), is an offset of the renal artery, and divides into convoluted loops of the fineness of capil- laries, which form the exterior of the tuft. The other, the efferent vessel (/), begins in the interior of the tuft by the union of the loops on the outer surface ; and passing out is distributed in a close network of capillaries (g) on the convoluted urine tubes, and in one with elongated meshes on the straighter tubes near the pyramids. The office of the glomerulus is to secrete the watery part of the urine. Bloodvessels. The artery and vein distributed to the kidney are very large in proportion to the size of the organ they nourish. Renal artery. As the artery enters the kidney it divides into four or five branches, which are invested by sheaths of the fibrous capsule, and reach the bases of the pyramids of Malpighi, where they form arches. From those arches arise small interpyramidal two, afferent, and efferent, which unite. Use of glomerulus. Blood- vessels of kidney.

LIGAMENTS OF THE WEIST-JOINT. 83 liganientary fibres of the articulation. Occasionally it is perforated in its centre, and then the lower extremity of the ulna comes in contact Math the os cuneiforme, in which case the ulna might be said to assist in forming the wrist-joint. The synovial membrane, lining the articulation, covers the extremity of the radius, the under surface of the fibro-cartilage, is reflected from these on the ligaments, and passes thence to line the upper surface of the three carpal bones. Connected with this articulation, but not exactly be- longing to it, are the anterwr and posterior annular liga- ments of the wrist; these are two strong fibrous membranes, situated on the anterior and posterior part of the wrist^ and surrounding it like a wring or annulus. The anterior annular ligament is placed in front of the carpal boues; externally, it is attached to the anterior surface of the os trapezium and os scaphoides, passes transversely inwards, and is attached internally to the hook-like process of the unciform bone, and sends a process to be attached to the os pisiforme: between these two portions the ulnar artery and nerve pass.' The anterior surface of this ligament is covered by the integu- ments, and is crossed by the superficialis voIec artery, and in the centre by a small branch of the median nerve; it gives origin externally to the abductor, opponeus, and flexor brevis poUicis muscles, internally to the palmaris brevis. Its posterior surface is arched, and has passing beneath it the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis, flexor profundus, flexor sublimis, and flexor longus pollicis muscles, and the median nerve: it is here lined by a synovial sheath, which envelops these tendons. Into its superior edge is implanted the tendon of the palmaris longus muscle ; from its inferior edge arises the palmar aponeurosis: its use is to form an arch for the passage of the above-mentioned parts, to protect them from iniury and to connect tlie carpal bones in the transverse direction, and thus prevent tlie arch which they form from beir 11* — I--"— - "iJiuii Luey lorm irom being obhterated, and so as not to interfere with the action of tne tendons. Hhe posterior annular ligament is not near so well marked, and appears to be merely a prolongation of the

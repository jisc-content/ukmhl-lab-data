So many parts thus passing beneath Poupart's hga- nient, nearly obliterate the space between it and the bone, so that the descent of a femoral hernia is, by these means, at least partially prevented. As, however, many mter- stices must exist between these parts, it becomes neces- sary that some additional structure should exist, in order to preserve the integrity of the abdommal cavity, ihis structure does exist, and is formed by the junction of the transversalis fascia and the fascia iliaca behind Poupart s ^^^ThT%scia transversalis descends from the inguinal canal, passes backwards, and, behind Poupart's ligament, meets with the fascia iliaca. , . , . . This is a dense layer of fascia, which invests the ante- rior surface of the ihacus internus muscle; extermlly and superiorly, it is firmly attached to the mner hp of the crest of the ilium. Tracing it inwards, it covers the muscle, passes behind the external iUac vessels, sending off at the same time an expansion, which passes m front ot these vessels, binds them down, and forms the fascia pro- pria or sheath of the external iliac artery, fh-st described by Mr. Abernethy. At the inner side of the ihac vessels the fascia iUaca becomes attached to the iho-pectmeal line whence it descends into the pelvis, under the name of the nelvic fascia. Near the pubes the fascia ihaca becomes LtSnuou with the pectineal portion of the fasca lata, and albernat's ligament. Inferiorly or towai-c^ the fernoi. region, the fascia iliaca curves forwards, and meets the raTs;;rsahs fascia immediately behind Poupart Ui^^^^^^^ where the two fasciae, united, form a dense -l»tis n- dinoas line, which, indicating the course «f ^^^^ "^^^ circumflexa ilii vessels, extemls from the spine of 1. ilmm to the outer edge of the femoral 'artery and thus precludes the possibility of a hernial tumour descendmg between these points. , i.- •„ *^„,,.

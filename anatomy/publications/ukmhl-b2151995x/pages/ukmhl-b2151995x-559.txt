FEMORAL HERNIA. 543 space exists, which is covered over by a thin layer of cel- lular substance, named the cnhriform fascia or middle portion of the fascia lata. This is in general described as a process of the fascia lata, with which indeed it is per- fectly continuous at the circumference of the opening; at the same time it is so intimately connected with the super- ficial fascia, being in fact identified with it, that it may be with equal propriety described as being derived from this fascia. The cribriform fascia is in density intermediate between the fascia lata and the superficial fascia. The cribriform fascia exhibits, as its name implies, a number of foramina, which transmit numerous veins and nerves, passing between the superficial and deeper parts One, larger than the rest, is formed by the saphena vein dipping m, to join the femoral; this is the saphenous opening; through it a femoral hernia most frequently passes forwards beneath the superficial fascia: it is bounded mfenorly by Burns's ligament. From the little resistance the cribriform fascia afi^ords, a femoral hernia soon makes Its way through it; this it effects either by bursting throu<>h the fascia, or dilating one of the openings in it, most frequently the saphenous. Having thus examined the parts on the anterior surface ot the thigh, we next proceed to ascertain by what means a hernia is enabled to escape from the cavity of the ab domen, so as to descend behind the fascia lata. For this purpose we draw the peritoneum and viscera out of the iliac fossae, and examine the parts which descend beneath i;oupart s hgament. As this ligament stretches across tne bnm of the pelvis, between the anterior superior soi nous process of the iUum and the tubercle of the pubes' It leaves a large space (the crural arch) between it and tUe bone, by means of which several structures are trans mitted from the pelvis to the thigh, or in the 0000^: direction. Thus, between the spines'of the ilium T m guino-cutaneous nerve descends; internal to this thJ psoas magnus and iliacus internus muscles, and between them the anterior crural nerve, descend in a deep W st.ll more internally, the femoral vessels pass fh' inner side of these the absorbent vessels f om the fo^fe

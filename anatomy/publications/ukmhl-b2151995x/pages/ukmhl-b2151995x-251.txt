The first arteries given off from the aorta are the right and left coronary, for the supply of the heart itself. These vessels are sent off before the pericardium quits the aorta, and receive their blood in a different manner from all other arteries in the body, viz., the blood enters them by regur- gitation, and flows in a retrograde du-ection. The right coronary artery passes along the right border of the pulmonary artery, then transversely in the groove between the right auricle and right ventricle, to the under surface of the heart, as far as the septum, where it divides into two branches; one runs in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle, anastomosing with the left coronary, the other descends between the two ventricles as far as the apex of the heart. The left coronary artery, smaller than the right, comes oft from the aorta, a little higher up, and is first observed between the pulmonary artery and left auricle; when it arrives at the septum ventriculorum, it divides into two branches, one takes a transverse course to the left, running in the groove between the left auricle and ventricle, anasto- mosing with the right coronary; the other runs down on the upper surface of the heart, along the septum of the ventricles as far as the apex. From these vessels minute branches pass into the several parts of the heart, and supply the roots of the large vessels. The veins of the heart, which return the blood from the coronary arteries, ultimately unite into one, which termi- nates in the right auricle between the opening of the inferior vena cava, and the right auriculo-ventricular oST^' valvular fold partially covering the The nerves supplying the heart are principally derived from the cardiac filaments of the sympathetic in t^he n ck and in a less degree from the pneumo-gastric. rhe muscular tissue of the heart is peculiar; for although 18 involuntary in its action, it has striped muscular fibres ouLr'llTrroflfb^d;''^" '''' Jr^thl'^Zf T^''''' '^^''^ commences the aorta, which at first ascends upwards towards the right

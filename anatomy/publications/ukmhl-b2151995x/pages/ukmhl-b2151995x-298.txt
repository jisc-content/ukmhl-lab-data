282 REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. some of these tske a superficial course, perforate the cranial aponeurosis, and supply the cutis and bulbs of the hairs, whilst others pass to the periosteum, and are finally distri- buted to the bones, where, in the diploe, they anastomose with the branches of the meningeal arteries. Ail the terminal branches of these arteries anastomose freely with each other, and with the meningeal arteries, a tact ot much importance, as it serves to explain the tendency there is always to inflammation of the brain and its mem- branes, where the external parts have become diseased or have been iniured. The nerves of the scalp are the f>-ontal, which accom- pany the arteries of the same name, and are derived from the first division of the fifth; the ^em^JoraZ, which accom- pany the temporal artery in great numbers; they are derived from the fifth, the portio dura of the seventh and the cervical plexus ; and branches from the cervical plexus which accompany the occipital arteries. The osseous case, which incloses the bram, and is generally known under the name of cranium or skull is well adapted to protect the organ from injury, m con- sequence of the number of bones which enter into its formation, mutually supporting each other, and presenting ^\retttr.;/.^«.^. are the dura mater, the arac^ and the pia mater, and are described with the brain and ""TuZl'lZal surfaces of the cranium we meet with the muscles of the exteriial ear They are f ^e in numb^^^^^^^^^ small, and often imperfectly developed.

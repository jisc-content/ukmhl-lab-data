49 LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. apex inferiorly, the base superiorly ; it is lined by cartilage, and is divided by a nearly vertical ridge into an external and internal part, which correspond with the external and internal condyles. THE LIGAMENTS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. The ligaments of the knee-joint are divided into external and internal.— The superficial or external ligaments are the— ligamentum patellm, external and internal lateral ligaments, ligamentum postieum of Winslow. The internal are the— two alar ligaments, ligamentum mucosum, transverse ligament, two crucial ligaments, ligament of IFrisberg. This articulation is strengthened by an aponeurotic expansion, derived from the fascia lata, and the vasti muscles; which is much stronger externalhj than inter- nally, and passes inferiorly in a transverse direction across the ligamentum patellte, which it here binds firmly down ; on raising this we bring into view, in front of the patella, the parietes of a large bursa mucosa which covers the anterior surface of this bone, and is interposed between it and the expansion from the extensor tendons • below this IS a very small and indistinct bursa in front of the ligamentum patellse. The ligamentum patellm arises from the apex of the patella, passes downwards and outwards, and is inserted into the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia; it is from two to three inches in length, narrow in the centre ex- panded at either extremity; its outer edge is better defined and longer than the internal; a large bursa separates it from the smooth surface on the upper extremfty of the tib a and the superior part of the tubercle. Although called ligament, it is more probably a tendon ; originat It was the continuation of the recl^is femoris tendon^ U^ pate la being developed in its structure, to obviate lie effects of friction ; l,ke tendons, it is smooth and polished and its fibres are longitudinal. f ""oueu 3

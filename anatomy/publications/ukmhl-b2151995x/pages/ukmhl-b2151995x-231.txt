The hairs of the head are round, but those of the other parts of the body are more or less flattened, and sometimes even pnsmoid in form. The sebaceous glands vary in shape, being large in the nose and in the armpits, and very small in most other parts and are formed by one or more small lobules opening into an excretory duct, which pierces the rete mucosum and cuticle to reach the surface of the skin ; some of the ducts however, only open into the hair follicles, and reach the skin by those means. The sebaceous glands are lod-ed in the cutis, but do not lie so deep as the sweat glands. Ihe sudoriparous (perspiratory or sweat) glands are situated m the lowest part of the corium.

THE EYE. ] 95 muscles, nerves, vessels, fat, and part of the lacrymal apparatus. In dissecting the orbit, and removing its roof, the nerves will be found passing through the sphenoidal fissure in the following order: Fourth pair. Frontal of the fifth. Superior division of the third. External to these, and nearly on the same plane, the lacrv- mal of the fifth. ' Inferior division of the third. The sixth pair, lowest. The optic nerve enters by the foramen opticum, with the ophthalmic artery. The trunk of the ophthalmic artery, at first below and to the outer side of the optic nerve, soon after crosses over to get to Its mner side. The ophthalmic vein is situated below all the nerves. Before proceeding to the description of the eye, we shall mention the external appendages, which are the eye-brows eyehds, and lacrymal apparatus. The eyebrows consist of the integuments covering the supraorbital ridge of the frontal boni on each side. Thev contain adipose tissue and fibres of the occipito-frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles, and are studded with hairs, extending in an arched direction from near the root the eye ^'^"'''^ Â«f The eyebrows are useful in protecting the eyes from weat and foreign bodies falling down from the fbr head ThT^;;: ^-i^es being highly ornamental.' ihe eyelids are two thin curtains covering the eve and are superior and inferior.

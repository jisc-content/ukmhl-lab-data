ARTICULATIONS. o V a a c . « to E.S it o S ■;= o = CJ o Harmonia. GOMPHOSIS, Schindylesis. Suture. Denticulated, where the bones pre- sent a serrated appearance, and are interlocked with one another, as ia the sagittal and coronal sutures. Squamous, where they overlap, as in the squamous suture of the temporal bone. Where the bones present slightly rough substances, and are juxta- posed, as in the articulations of the superior maxillary bones. Where one bone is implanted into another, as a nail is into wood. The teeth in the alveoli are the only examples of this. Where one plate of bone is received into a groove or fissure in another, or between two other bones, as the vomer receives the azygos process of the sphenoid bone, or is received between the two su- perior maxillary bones. The above four possess no motion. Symphysis. Where the bones are united by cartilage, or fibro- cartilage, little motion, if any, being enjoyed, as in the sym- physis pubis, the sacro-iliac symphysis, the junction of the bodies of the vertebra;. Synchondrosis. Where the same connection exists, but more motion is enjoyed, as between the ribs and costal cartilages. The connection between the scapula and trunk, and that of the os-hyoides, is called syssarcosis, but cannot be classed amongst articulations. The motions enjoyed by articulations are, flexion, ex- tension, adduction, abduction, rotation, and circumduction. The Skeleton is divided into the head, trunk, loioer and upper extremities. The Trunk is divided into the Spine, Thorax, and Pelvis. The Spine is a pyramidal column, situated at the pos- terior part of the trunk, extending from the head to the pelvis ; it serves the important offices of supporting the head, thorax, and upper extremities superiorly, resting j3 ^ O C3 Amphiarthrosis

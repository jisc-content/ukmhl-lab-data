THE LEG. .399 the deep muscles of the leg. The fascia of the leg is of use in binding down the muscles ; it also affords origin to most of them, and sends in septa or partitions between them which become attached to the tibia and fibula. The annular ligaments are dense fibrous bands, which bind down the tendons in front of and behind the ankle- joint: they are two in number, the anterior and posterior. The anterior annular ligament passes across the extensor tendons and anterior tibial vessels and nerve; it arises internally from the internal malleolus and os naviculare, ascends outwards, and is implanted externally into the external malleolus and os calcis ; it is stronger here than internally, and extends above the ankle-joint; it forms three distinct sheaths for the passage of the tendons and ves- sels beneath it, and is lined by a synovial membrane Avhich is reflexed from it on the tendons, and continues for some distance on the dorsum of the foot. The posterior or internal annular ligament is broader and more dense than the anterior; it binds down the flexor tendons and posterior tibial vessels and nerve ; it stretches from the internal malleolus backwards and outwards to the inner surface of the astragalus and os calcis. Kaise the fascia from the anterior surface of the leg and the muscles between the tibia and fibula will be exposed â€¢ they are four in number, viz., ' Tibialis anticus, Extensor longus digitorum, Extensor proprius pollicis, Peroneus tertius. On the outer part of the leg are the two followino- 19P pa . O muscles Peroneus longus, Peroneus brevis. The muscles on the back of the leg are seven in num- ber and are divided mto two sets, a superficial and deep by the posterior tibial vessels and nerves and by the deep fascia; the superficial set consists of three muscles, viz.' Gastrocnemim, Salens, Plantaris.

REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. 392 named morbus coxse, or any other affection which may require a local irritant for its renaoval. On raising the gluteus maximus the following parts are brought into view from above downwards; the gluteus medius, the pyriformis, and between these, the gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve; below the pyriformis the great and lesser sciatic nerves pass out, as also the sciatic and pudic arteries; all these parts, with the ex- ception of the gluteus medius, escape through the great sciatic notch; below these are the superior gemellus, the obturator internus tendon (which passes out through the lesser sciatic notch where the internal pudic artery enters,) the inferior gemellus, the qnadratus femoris, and beneath these the tendon of the obturator externus. The tuber ischii, and the origins from it of the hamstring muscles, and the great sciatic ligament, are also seen in this dis- section. The muscles of this region are of much service in strengthening the hip-joint, hke the muscles on the anterior and inner part of the thigh which are attached to the pelvis ; they also serve to fix the pelvis on the lower ex- tremity when this itself is fixed, as in the standing position; most of the small muscles around the hip-joint are rup- tured in dislocation of this articulation. In dislocation on the dorsum of the ilium the head of the femur hes under cover of the gluteus maximus and medius, and on the torn fibres of the gluteus minimus ; in dislocation into the obturator foramen, the obturator externus is the only muscle relaxed. In the dissection of the preceding mus- cles several vessels and nerves of importance are met with; the principal arteries are the gluteal, sciatic, and pudic branches of the internal iliac artery. The gluteal artery escapes through the upper part of the great sciatic notch, above the pyriformis muscle, and accompanied by the superior gluteal nerve; it soon divides into numerous branches which are distributed to the muscles in the glu- teal region, and anastomose with the circumflexa ilii, cir- ciimflexa femoris, sciatic, and pudic arteries. The sciatic artery passes out also through the great sciatic notch, but below the pyriformis; it descends with the sciatic nerve between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter, and is distributed to the surrounding muscles ; the pudic artery passes out with the precediug, winds around the spine of

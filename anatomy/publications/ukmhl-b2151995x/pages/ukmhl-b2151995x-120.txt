ANATOMY. 104 tact with the enamel; in this way ossification proceeds, until it is so far advanced that it contracts the si^e of the pulp, and at last completely surrounds it, except at its base, leaving, in this manner, the cavity already described as existing in eacli tooth ; the adhesion of the pulp to the newly-formed tooth is but sUght, as they can be easily separated without injuring any apparent vascular con- nection. At first the body of the tooth alone is formed, when this is completed it begins to contract, and becomes somewhat rounded, forms the neck, and from this then the fang or fangs commence; these form by the elon- gation of the pulp, and the deposit of bony matter on it, and at last increase to such an extent as to cause the ele- vation of the body of the tooth above the gum, the alveoli at the same time contracting so as to embrace the fang; as ossification proceeds, the extremity of the ossified part is thin, elastic, and transparent, and has received the name of substantia cornea; when one fang alone is formed the pulp sends down but one process ; when two or more fangs are to be formed, a like number of processes elongate from the body of the pulp, which are afterwards separated hv bony partitions, sent across from the bony margin ot the cavity in the body of the tooth. When the tooth first appears through the gum, it is very imperfect in structure, its fang is but badly developed, and its cavity is large. In this way the bony part of the tooth is formed on the pulp, but how deposited is not perhaps to be explained. The enamel is deposited in a different manner; tor this purpose the pulp is enclosed by a membrane, divided into as many bags or cells as there are teeth forming at the time ; they are of a whitish appearance externally, but very vascular internally, and are termed the capsules It is tlie inner surface of these which secretes the enamel, its outer surface adhering firmly to the gum. This membrane deposits the enamel shortly after the tooth begins to be formed, in greatest quantity where most is required, as mentioned in the description of the teeth ; it is at first soft moist, and rough, but when it has acquired the tul degree of thickness, it assumes its natural shining and polished appearance; it is completed when the tooth .appears through the gum. At this time the capsule having performed its office loses its vascularity, becomes absorbed

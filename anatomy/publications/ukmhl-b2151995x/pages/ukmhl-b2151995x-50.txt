ANATOMY. 34 The two condyles differ from each other in many par- ticulars. The internal condyle is— longer from before, backwards; shorter transversely, projects more posteriorly, ,, less anteriorly, descends lower when the bone is placed vertically. Both of them are covered with cartilage to a much greater extent posteriorly than anteriorly, on account of their relation to the patella. The femur is articulated with three bones, viz., the os innommatum, tibia, and patella. It consists of compact tissue in its centre, spongy at its extremities. Numerous small arteries supply it, especially near the extremities, and a nutritious branch is found to enter the shaft along the linea aspera, either midway or a little higher up ; it is found to enter the bone in an ascending direction, in opposition to the current of the blood. It has five points of ossification ; one for the head, one for each trochanter, one for the shaft, and one for the condyles. The bone is perfectly ossified at about the twentieth year.

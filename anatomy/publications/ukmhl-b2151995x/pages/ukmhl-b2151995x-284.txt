268 ANATOMY. The tunica vaginalis surrounds the testis, except at its upper and back part; it is thence reflexed on the sides of the epididymis, forming a cul-de-sac on the outer side, between the testis and epididymis, from which it ascends, to a short distance, on the lateral and anterior surfaces of the cord ; from the cord it passes off and lines the inner surface of the scrotum. The layer of the tunica vaginahs, which covers the testis, is called the tu7iica vaginalis testis; that which lines the scrotum, the tunica vaginalis scroti This membrane is lubricated by a thin serous fluid, which allows of the free motion of the testis. It is often the seat of the disease hydrocele. THE TESTES. Each testis, or testicle, is oval in shape, with the long axis directed obliquely downwards, backwards, and in- wards ; its upper extremity, turned a Uttle outwards, is the larger ; its outer surface is convex, its inner flattened; its anterior margin, directed also downwards, is free ; its pos- terior or upper is covered by the epididymis, and is perforated by the vessels of the gland. The testis pos- sesses two coats, an outer, partial one, as just described from the tunica vaginalis; and an inner, fibrous one, named the tunica albuginea, which resembles the sclerotic coat of the eye is of a bluish-white colour, and is composed of fibres interlaced together in all directions; from its inner surface several processes pass backwards to the corpus highmoniarum, forming the mediastinum testis. The inner surface of the tunica albuginea is lined by numerous vessels forming a tunica vasculosa. The interior ot the testis is composed of a soft, reddish-gray, pulpy substance, formed of a number of small vessels, the tubuli semimferi loosely connected by cellular tissue: these are collected into bunches, separated by the processes which are sent oti from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea; from these bundles about fifteen or twenty tubes pass, directly back- wards, to the posterior part of the gland, and are called the tubuli recti; they enter the mediastinum testis, and then running between the two layers of the corpus high- moniarum form, with the vessels and nerves of the testis, the rete testis; from the upper part of this structure from ten to fifteen vessels, under the name of vasa efferentia, perforate the tunica albuginea, and enter the upper part of

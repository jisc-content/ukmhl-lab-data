THE NECK. 289 The omo-hyoid muscle crosses the neck also, but in a contrary direction ; it ascends from behind forwards, from the scapula to the os hyoides; it therefore decussates the sterno-raastoid, and thus forms the several triangles of the neck; it is a digastric muscle, its tendon lying behind the sterno-mastoid. The omo-hyoid is of much use in guiding us in our several operations on the common carotid artery, and on the subclavian in its third stage It crosses the scaleni muscles, the brachial plexus, the phrenic and sympathetic nerves, and the sheath of the common carotid artery. The sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles are situated in front of the trachea, larynx, and thyroid body. As these muscles ascend from the sternum to their insertions, they take a somewhat contrary course, that is, the sterno- tiyoid muscles converge, whilst the others diverge Be- tween the muscles of either side, on the mesial line, a cellular hne exists, in which our incisions are made in the operations of tracheotomy and laryngotomy. Inferiorlv these muscles, and particularly the sterno-thyroid, from their great breadth, overlap the carotid artery; this vessel however, passes backwards from beneath them as it ascends. Connected with the origins of these muscles the terminating filaments of the descendens noni nerve may be seen. On raising these muscles, the carotid sheath, the larynx, trachea, and thyroid body are exposed- and, by a little further dissection, the cervicJl and ffachiai plexuses, and the subclavian vessels will be exposed ■ the cervical plexus being situated at the upper and posterior ^velbfclaS;.^^^^ "'^^^ "^^^ ^ ^-'^^ The thyroid body ov gland is a large, soft, reddish mass which lies in front of the trachea, and alo^g the sidTof the larynx.

THE ABDOMINAL AOKTA. 237 The Bronchial arteries come off rather irregularly from the under part of the arch of the aorta, being sometimes pai-tly derived from the intercostal arteries, but more fre- quently so on the right side : tbey are usually two to each lung, which structure they are supposed to nourish. The (Esophageal arteries come off from the anterior part of the aorta rather regularly, and are four or five in number supplymg the oesophagus during its descent. The Intercostals from the aorta are generally ten on each side those of the right being the longest, on account of the position of the aorta; they pass in front of the spine behind the oesophagus, sympathetic nerve, and vena azygos. \Uen he intercostals of each side reach the intercostal space, they give off a dorsal trunk, then proceed onwards, first between the pleura and external intercostal muscles Zt' ^%f^%^"Slf^ «f tlie ribs, when they run forwards between the two layers of intercostal muscles, giving off superficial penetrating branches, and anastomose with the anterior intercostal branches from the internal mammary Z llu \ ^ t« the lower bordeV of each rib, haying generally their corresponding vein upenoriy, and the nerve inferioriy.

REGIONAL AND SUEGICAL ANATOMY. 398 cends along the inner side of the leg a little behind the inner edge of the tibia, receiving in its course numerous branches from the integuments ; it then ascends over the internal condyle of the femur near its posterior part, enters the thigh, continues its course upwards along the inner surface of the thigh, â– where it becomes much increased in size from the addition of numerous branches, turns out- wards, perforates the cribriform fascia, and terminates in the femoral vein, an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament. The external or posterior saphena vein, commences by small veins from the integuments, covering the heel and outer side of the foot ascends generally behind the external malleolus, sinks beneath the fascia of the leg, passes upwards between it and the gastrocnemius muscle along the posterior surface of the leg, and terminates in the popliteal vein: sometimes it joins the internal saphena vein in the leg: they always communicate freely. The ex- ternal saphena vein is accompanied by the external saphe- nous nerve, a branch formed from the posterior tibial and peroneal nerves. Several cutaneous nerves, in addition to the two saphe- nous, are met with in the superficial fascia ; the largest of these is the musculo-cutaneous nerve, a branch of the pe- roneal, which perforates the fascia on the anterior surface of the leg at the junction of its middle and inferior thirds, and descends to supply the integument on the dorsum of the foot. Beneath the superficial fascia lies the fascia of the leg ; this is derived superiorly from the fascia lata, and is con- tinuous with the tendons around the knee-joint. In the upper part of the leg it is attached to the heads of the tibia and fibula; from this it descends to cover the muscles of the leg, being attached to the margins of the tibia and fibula, until it arrives near the ankle-joint; it here becomes continuous with the annular Hgameuts of the articulation, and is attached to the external and internal malleoli. The fascia of the leg is stronger superiorly than inferiorly, and on the anterior than the posterior surface; it is wanting over the anterior surface of the tibia, and near the heel is irregular and indistinct; it here winds round the tendo Achillis, and becomes continuous with the fascia covering

THE BRAIN. 151 •wide and deep; they are composed of white and grey matter, the latter being internal, and through their centre pass the fibres of the anterior pyramids, from which circumstance they have been called the posterior cerebral ganglia; they form the middle ganglia of increase of the anterior pyramids of the spinal cord. The boundaries and relations of the thalami optici may be given as follows: Internally they are bounded by the third ventricle, across which they are connected by the middle and posterior commissures. Externally they form a portion of the roof of the descending cornu of the lateral ventricle. Anteriorly the optic thalami are continuous with the corpora striata, posteriorly they are bounded by the de- scending cornu, and have developed upon them two rounded eminences, called the corpus geniculatum externum and internum, from the former of which the optic nerve takes one of its origins. Superiorly, the thalamus opticus is partially covered by the posterior pillars of the fornix, the remainder of its surface forming a part of the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle, whilst inferioriy it is con- nected with the crura cerebri, as well as slightly with the corpora albicantia. The thalami optici are also connected at their posterior part, by small peduncles with the Pineal gland, and with the nates. The fornix is a triangular lamina of white substance, with its apex directed forwards and its base backwards' anteriorly dividing into two round bands, which pass almost vertically downwards behind the anterior com- missure to terminate in the corpora albicantia: posteriorly it IS connected with the corpus callosum, and divides late- rally mto a posterior cornu on each side, which terminates m, or rather is continuous with the t^nia hippocampi hippocampus major and minor: superiorly, the fornix is attached to the septum lucidum; its sides slightly overlao he optic thalami, whilst its inferior surface JveTZ third ven ricle, from which it is partially separated by tl e velum interpositum. On the under surface of the fornk are seen some longitudinal Unes, to which the term «,«;^e- rzum, or yr«, has been applied, from a supposed resem- bknce to the strings of a harp.

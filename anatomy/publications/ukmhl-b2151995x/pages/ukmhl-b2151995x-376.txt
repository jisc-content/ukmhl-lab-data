360 HEGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY, terminates by supplying the neighbouring muscles, and anastomosing", with the anastomotica magna, and inferior profunda arteries. The posterior ulnar recurrent artery ascends to the fossa between the internal condyle and olecranon process, where it lies with and beneath the ulnar nerve, between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris; it supplies the elbow-joint and triceps muscle, and anastomoses with the inferior profunda and anasto- motica magna arteries. A short distance below the preceding, the ulnar artery gives olF the arteria interossea: this vessel, of considerable size, passes backwards, downwards, and outwards, to arrive at the interosseous membrane; it gives off a few twigs, which ascend in front of the elbow-joint, and anas- tomose with the other arteries in this situation. At the upper extremity of the interosseous membrane, the interos- seous artery divides into two branches, named the anterior and posterior interosseous. The anterior branch descends along the anterior surface of the interosseous membrane, between the flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum profundus, accompanied by a branch of the median nerve, to the upper edge of the pro- nator quadratus, where it divides into two branches, one of which descends in the substance of the muscle in front of the wrist into the palm of the hand, where it anastomoses with the anterior carpal arteries, and the deep palmar arch; the other branch passes backwards through the in- terosseous membrane to the back of the wrist and hand, where it anastomoses with the posterior carpal and inter- osseous arteries. The posterior interosseous artery passes between the anterior oblique ligament and the upper edge of the inter- osseous membrane to the back of the forearm, where, between the superficial and deep layers of muscles, it divides into two branches, one of which, the posterior in- terosseous recurrent, ascends in the substance of the anconeus to the fossa between the internal condyle and olecranon process, where it anastomoses with branches from the superior profunda artery. The other branch descends amongst the extensor tendons to the wrist, where it anastomoses with the posterior carpal arteries, and witli the posterior branch of the anterior interosseous artery.

STRANGULATED INGUINAL HERNIA. 529 may be enabled to distinguish between them in the fol- lowing manner: A hydrocele commences from below a tiernia from above; its shape is pyriform, the base beneath • a hernia is more elongated. Hydrocele is in general transparent; in it the spermatic cord may be distinctly lelt below the external ring, by grasping it between the hnger and thumb and gently rolling it at the same time ; the testis lies to the upper and back part of a hydrocele, beneath the tumour m a hernia. Still the diagnosis is ii^ some cases difficult, from the varieties occasionally ob- served in both aflfectious. ^ A hydrocele may be combined with an inguinal hernia: m this case the hernia will lie behind the hydrocele con sequently the operator is obliged to discharge the fluid (if the tumour be large , and then cut through the tunica vaginabs to the hernial sac. ° A varicocele or spermatocele, a varicose state of the Efa Jheir '"■'"'^ /"^"^"^^^ mistaken for a fterma; the diagnosis is simple.

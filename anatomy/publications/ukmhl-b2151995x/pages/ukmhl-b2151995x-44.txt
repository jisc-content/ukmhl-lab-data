ANATOMY. 28 tilaginous structures. The sacrum is connected with the last lumbar vertebra by the intervertebral substance, the liga- menta subjlava, and the continuation of the anterior and posterior common ligaments, &c., precisely as the vertebrae are connected together, with the addition of the following ligament. The sacro-vertebral ligament arises on each side from the anterior and inferior surface of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra, descends obliquely downwards and outwards, and is inserted into the base of the sacrum, where it is continuous with the other ligamentary struc- tures in this situation. The iliu7n is connected with the spinal column by the ilio- lumbar ligament only; it is of a triangular shape, and arises narrow, thick, and pointed from the summit of the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra; it passes almost horizontally outwards, and is implanted into the posterior superior part of the crest of the ilium : it gives origin by its upper edge to the quadratus lumborum muscle, and anteriorly to the iliacus internus. Between the sacrum and ilium we have an articulation, sacro-iliac synchondrosis, more frequently called the sacro- iliac ^symphysis, from its possessing little if any motion; this articulation is formed by irregular articulating surfaces on the lateral surfaces of the sacrum and ilium, each of which is lined by a thin layer of cartilaginous structure almost united together in the adult, and possessing in its interior a remarkable semifluid substance: in the foetus the articulation is lined by a synovial membrane; anteriorly and posteriorly it is strengthened by irregular bands of fibres, termed, from their situation and attachment, the anterior and posterior sacro-iliac hgaments ; they are ex- ceedingly strong, and are attached internally to the sacrum, and externally to the posterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, spreading out to be continuous with the peri- osteum and the other ligaments of this part. The sacmm is connected with thQischium by the greater and lesser sacro-sciatic ligainents. The greater sacro-sciatic ligament arises from the lateral and posterior surfaces of the sacrum, and also from the posterior inferior spinous process of the ilium and edge of the 08 coccygis; it passes downwards, forwards, and out-

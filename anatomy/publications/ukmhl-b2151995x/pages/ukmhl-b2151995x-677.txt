ANEURISM. 661 termination. Whilst the diagnosis of an external aneurism is in general simple, that of an internal aneurism has frequently baffled the most skilful of practitioners : we may resort to an operation in most cases of external aneurism, but such treatment is impossible in the greater number of the internal. In the case of the traumatic aneurism we may tie the artery close to the tumour; in the spontaneous aneurism such treatment is inadmissible, as we tie a diseased vessel. To the above divisions of aneurism may be added the aneurisjnal varix, varicose aneuris7n, dissecting aneurism, and aneurism hy anastomosis, all of which will be con- sidered when we shall have completed the more important forms above alluded to. The larger arteries are much more liable to disease of aneurism than the small, and those of the lower than those of the upper extremities; thus Mr. Hodgson has found that, in sixty-three cases, twenty-one were of the ascending aorta, arteria innominata, and arch of the aorta, seven of the descending aorta, two of the carotid artery, five of the subclavian and axillary, twelve of the inguinal artery, fourteen of the femoral and popliteal; of all these, seven only occurred in the female subject. The arteries of the leg or forearm are rarely the seat of aneurism. If we trace the formation of an aneurismal tumour from its first existence, we shall find that, as soon as the internal and middle walls have given way, the blood passes beneath the cellular coat of the vessel, and thus raises it so as to form the swelling; the cellular coat affords a slight barrier to the blood for a short time, but soon yielding, would in its turn burst, and thus cause the death of the patient by * â–  the sudden haemorrhage, were it not that the violence done to the surrounding parts by the distension excites adhesive inflammation, which throws out coagulable lymph; this- causing the adhesion of the neighbouring structures,' forms the aneurismal sac, and prevents for a further time the distension of the swelling. The tumour having now attained a moderate size, but varying, as is evident it'nnist, according to the resistance of the surrounding tissue, and the greater or less density of the cellular substance, becomes distinct if situated near the surface of the body or extremity, and is in a condition best adapted to the

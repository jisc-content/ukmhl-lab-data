REGION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 355 several branches to the surrounding muscles; some of these ascend to the deltoid muscle to anastomose with the circumflex arteries, others descend in the triceps and brachialis anticus, and keep up an anastomosis with the various branches of the radial, ulnar, and interosseous recurrent arteries about the elbow-joint. The arteria profunda inferior generally arises opposite the insertion of the coraco-brachialis muscle ; runs down- wards, backwards, and inwards, through the internal intermuscular ligament imbedded in the substance of the triceps muscle, and accompanied by the ulnar nerve, which lies to its inner side, or posterior to it, to the fossa between the internal condyle and olecranon process, where it terminates by anastomosing with the posterior ulnar recurrent artery. Arteria anastomotica magna arises in the lower third of the arm, descends along the anterior surface of the brachiahs anticus to the elbow-joint, where it terminates by anastomosing with the anterior ulnar recurrent artery m tront of the internal condyle, and with the inferior profunda and the posterior ulnar recurrent arteries, between the mternal condyle and olecranon process. Ihe brachial artery, besides the preceding gives off the arteria nutritia humeri, which perforates the tendon of the coraco-brachialis, enters the substance of the humerus desceuds obliquely, and supplies the cancelli and medul- lary membrane of the bone. In amputation of the arm the situation of the branches ot the brachial artery should be borne in mind, as thev frequently require to be tied, especially where any disease of the elbow-joint has existed for some time previously in which case all the arteries of the limb become much increased in size. The anastomoses around the elbow-ioint between the vessels of the arm and forearm, are so ibun- dant as to restore the circulation to the latter part when

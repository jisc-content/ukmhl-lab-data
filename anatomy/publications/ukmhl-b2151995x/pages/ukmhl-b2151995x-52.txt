36 ANATOMY. The Tibia is the principal bone of the leg, and is divided into a superior or femoral extremity, a body or .shaft, and an inferior or tarsal extremity. The upper or femoral extremity is much larger and more expanded than the lower; it is somewhat oval, longest transversely; on its upper surface we observe two articulating surfaces, an external and an internal, termed the condyles of the tibia, incrusted with cartilage for articulation with the femur, and separated from one another by a large bony promi- nence, termed the spine, and two rough surfaces, one in front, the other behind the spine ; the internal articular surface is of an oval shape, long from before backwards, is concave and more excavated than the external, corre- sponding with the internal condyle of the femur; the external articular surface is nearly circular, and but slightly excavated. Â« The spine, somewhat pyramidal in shape, is directed a little inwards and is placed neai'er the posterior than the anterior part of the tibia; in front of, and behind the spine, are two rough surfaces: the anterior one, large and irregular, gives insei-tion to the anterior extremities of the semilunar cartilages and to the anterior crucial ligament; the posterior, small and excavated posteriorly ; affords in- sertion to the posterior extremities of the semilunar cai-ti- lages and the posterior crucial ligament; as we descend from the articulating surfaces of the tibia we meet with, anteriorly, a large eminence, termed the tubercle of the tibia, which gives insertion to the liyamentum patellce; on the outer side of the tibia is a projection of the bone marked inferiorly by a smooth surface, for articulation with the upper extremity of the fibula; internally is a projection for the insertion of the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, marked with a groove for the anterior insertion of the semi-membranosus muscle, posteriorly, a superficial depression filled up by the posterior crucial ligament; the body or shaft of the tibia is that part intervening between the upper and lower extremities: it is large and triangular above, but becomes smaller and more circular inferiorly until we approach the inferior extremity where it again expands ; it may be divided into three surfaces, an internal, external, and a posterior, separated by three ridyes, an anterior, external, and

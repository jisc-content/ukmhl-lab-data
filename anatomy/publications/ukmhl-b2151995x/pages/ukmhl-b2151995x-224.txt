208 ANATOMY. posterior surface of the pars petrosa, giving passage to the portio mollis, portio dura, and an artery ^vhich runs some- what between the two nerves. At the bottom of this canal a little bony ridge is seen, separating it into two parts, the superior smaUer^and the inferior cribriform plate. Ihrough the upper opening the portio dura passes; througli the lower, the portio mollis and the artery. , , . The superior passage, or tube, is the aqueduct of Fallopius; it passes upwards and outwards then down- wards and outwards, and then backwards and downwards ; at first above the cochlea, then runs over he roof of the tympanum and terminates at the foramen stylo-mastoideum It conveys the vidian nerve and portio dura, which in its course gives filaments to pierce the bone, and supply the tensor tvmpani and stapedius muscles . r • i The auditory nerve at the bottom of the meatus divides into numerous filaments ; some pass into the foramma o the modiolus, and in their passage perforate its walls, and ar iv^ at the lamina spiralis, and walls of the scala, upon which they are spread out in the most delicate manner, rsecoi d sit in the vestibule expand almost to fill up this caZ and receive an i-f--^V/'-r StiS which has been named sacculus vestibuli. The thud sei es mount up over the former, and enter the semicircular On entering them, the nerves appear to expand nto a pufpy mass, which almost fills up the tubes ; thev are suppor? d by the liquor cotunnii. The arteries, which a e very deliJate, are, first, the branch from the basdar or Tsterior cerebral, which enters by the lamma cribro.a ramifies in ihe labyrinth; --nd a .^^^^^^^^ branch from the posterior auricular, enters the tympanum l7/ri^th sometimes forming an -^^^^ ^^t^^ xnembrani tympani by uniting ^vith the artery vvhich entei by the fissi/ra glasseri; third, the tympamc ^ranc give off from the internal maxillary artery ; it ^^"^ers th ough the fissura glasseri, ramifies in the tynn.anum, and -m o moses freely ^vith the stylo-mastoid ^^anch ^^e^em corresponding with the last-named «vtenes take a sun ar couise'^; but Uiose of the labyrinth terminate in the (ui - properly named) aqueducts of the vestibule and cochlea, which convey the blood to the lateral sinuses.

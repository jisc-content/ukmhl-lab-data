In the first stage the disease may be relieved or removed altogether, by the use of leeches and fomenta- tions to the eye, with the use of astringent ointments to the edges of the hd, and the occasional injection of fluids, by means of a fine syringe, along the puncta lacrymalia, into the nose, or by the introduction of a fine probe or bristle. In the more advanced stages an operation becomes necessary for its removal; this is performed as follows : Make an incision with a sharp-pointed knife into the lacrymal sac, commencing it immediately below the tendo-oculi, and extending it downwards and outwards to the extent of about three quarters of an mch, parallel to, and to the outer side of, the angular vein and artery; pass a probe downwards into the nasal duct, to free the canal, then introduce the style and allow it to remain until the canal becomes permanently free, withdrawing it occasionally for the purpose of cleansing it. The wound should be dressed with a dossil of dry lint, covered with a small piece of adhesive plaster. The style must be from an inch to an inch and a quarter in length. Before deciding on the existence of an obstruction in the nasal duct, the state of the puncta lacrymalia and nasal cavity should be ascertained, as an obstructed state of the former, or a tumour in the latter, will present most ot the symptoms of fistula laciymaUs.

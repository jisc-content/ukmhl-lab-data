THE DURA MATER, 142 The sinuses of the brain, or more strictly of the dura mater, are sixteen in number, four of which empty them selves directly into the Torcular Herophili, viz., the superior longitudinal, the straight, and the two occipital sinuses • two lead from it, viz., the two lateral sinuses, whilst the nine remaimng lie at the base of the brain, viz., the anterior and posterior chnoid sinuses, the two cavernous sinuses (which four together form the circular sinus of Ridley) the two superior petrosal, the two inferior petrosal, and the transverse. To these are sometimes added the torcular Merophili and the circular sinus, in which case there would be eighteen m all, Thesuperior longitudinal sinus commences at the foramen c^cum, which is situated just in front of the crista galli of the ethmoid bone; it passes first upwards, then directly backwards and do wnwards to empty itself into the torcular Sn^T 7u generally pours the greater part of its blood into the right lateral sinus. This sinus runs in the supenor or greater border of the fak major, of which he two layers form the sides of the sinus, the external layer of dura mater covermg it in. It will be therefore een^o be triangular in shape. In its interior will be seen several tnere aie also a few Pacchionian glands. Several vein^ open into the great longitudinal shius, the Section of which IS from behind forwards, thus opposing the course of the blood in the sinus which is from before backwards this arrangement checks the risk of regurgitation on a'; exertion by which otherwise the blood would be sent ba^k on thebram in every act of coughing, sneezing, or any other accidental excitement of the circuktion ; it may aS be themeans of preventing the toorapid passage of tSood The inferior longitudinal sinus runs in the same rW' tion as the former, but along the lower border of ^1,.?! major, and being entirely surrounded by this it f ^ circular in shapf.

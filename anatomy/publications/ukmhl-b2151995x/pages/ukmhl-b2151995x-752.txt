736 SUKGERY. Erythematous erysipelas is seated in the skin only, not involving the cellular tissue beneath, and shows itself idiopathically and symptomatically. The most frequent state of it is the face and head, but it may manifest itself in any part of the body; it is sometimes preceded by un- easiness, sickness, and shivering, then a redness appears (when attacking the face), first on the bridge of the nose, and extends itself to the eyelids, face, and forehead, having a distinct line of demarcation; the colour is bright red in young persons, deep rose red in the adult, and in weak and old persons has somewhat of a yellow tinge. The part loses its colour temporarily by pressure, on the re- moval of which it rapidly returns, and there is no pit remaining after pressure. There is a smarting, burning sensation, and considerable oedema; high fever, often passing on to delirium, and unfortunately sometimes at- tended with or followed by meningitis. It may terminate i n resolution with some desquamation of cuticle, or in vesica- tions containing a straw-coloured fluid, which may burst and dry up, or may degenerate into ulcers; and thirdly it may lead to abscesses, which require to be opened. Persons seem most liable to erysipelas who have injured their con- stitutions by intemperate habits. Treatment.â€”This disease is treated very variously by medical men, some adopting an actively antiphlogistic plan, others resorting to tonics and stimulants from the commencement; both systems are good with due discrimi- nation ; for in large towns and hospitals, where the air is less pure and the constitution less vigorous, active deple- tion is, as a rule, very detrimental. In the young and robust, bloodletting from the arm may be practised, also local bleeding by leeches, or by numerous punctures made in the part by a lancet; then give a good dose of calomel and colocynth or jalap to clear out the alimentary canal, or an emetic may precede this with advantage ; then ad- minister repeatedly saline diaphoretics, until any symptoms of depression manifest themselves, in which case we must resort to decoction of cinchona with ammonia, beef tea, and other light nourishment, and if necessary pi-oceed to stimulants. As to topical applications employed by medical men, they are very numerous, viz., cold evaporating lotions, warm fomentations, flour sprinkled over the part, cotton

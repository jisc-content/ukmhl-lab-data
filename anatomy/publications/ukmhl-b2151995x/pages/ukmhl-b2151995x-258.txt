ANATOMY. 242 the Foramen of Winslow; and its boundaries are as follow: Anteriorly, the lesser omentum and hepatic vessels. Posteriorly, the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon. Superiorly, lobulus caudatus or lobulus Spigelii of the Uver. Inferiorly, the superior portion of the duodenum. THIl STOMACH. The Stomach is a musculo-membranous bag, interposed between the oesophagus and duodenum. It is situated in the left hypochondrium, under the left false ribs, extends across the epigastric region, and terminates on reaching the right hypochondrium. The parts in relation with it are : Above and in front, the liver, diaphragm, and ribs. Tnfpriorlv ' the colon and mesocolon. fisterSy, the pancreas, spleen, and left supra-renal capsule. At its right extremity, the duodenum, Uver, and gall-bladder. There are two openings into it, the cardiac or cesopha- neal, and pyloric. The former is most posterior and su- perior, so that the stomach inclines obhquely forwards and downwards. . , ^ . . „ There are two surfaces, an anterior and posterior, in the ordinary state; but when the stomach is distended, the anterior becomes superior, and the PO^t^™"^ f f^^""^; lesser arch is carried further backwards, and the greater more forwards, extending even into the umbihcal region In this state of the stomach, its right extremity is m close contact with the gall-bladder. Th sTomach in its figure resembles a curved or obkng cone- it is largest at its oesophageal end ; the left third beyond the <B^sophagus is caUed the c-lf-e of the stomach, which in the child scarcely exists and wh ch affords an explanation why they vomit with so much ThJpyloric orifice is even smaller than the commence- ment of the duodenum. It is so situate as m a great measure to form an acute angle with the oesophagus The stomach is kept in its situation by its ""1°° JT^r the oesophagus and duodenum, by the lesser and greater on'entum, by the splenic omentum, and by the peritoneum attaching it to the diaphragm.

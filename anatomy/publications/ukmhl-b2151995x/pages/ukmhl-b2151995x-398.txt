382 REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. this point,) the fascia lata is exposed: this is a dense layer of fibrous aponeurotic structure which invests the thigh: externally it is much stronger than internally, where, in many cases, it is with difficulty distinguished. Infenorly the fascia lata is attached to the condyles of the temur and the different tendons around the knee-joint: a strong aponeurosis descends from it on either side of the patella and the ligamentum pateUse, and goes to be inserted into the spine of the tibia, where it is continuous with the fascia of the leg; as the fascia lata ascends upon the thigh it sends septa between the muscles, which form sheaths for these and binds them down ; on the posterior surface of the thigh it is attached to the linea aspera m its wliole length, as also to the tendon of the gluteus maximus and the short head of the biceps. Superiorly the fascia lata becomes attached on the posterior part to the sacrum and coccyx and the crest of the ilium; it is more thin and weak where it covers the glutseus maximus muscle, but at the anterior edge of this muscle becomes strong and well marked where it covers the tensor vagmse femoris and glutjeus medius. On the anterior part of the thigh the fascia lata is attached to Poupart's ligament, and inter- nally to the ramus of the ischium and pubis ; in the centre of this region, a short distance below Poupart s liganient, it leaves a small oval aperture closed up by the cribriform fascia, through which several veins and nerves pass m and out, and^ through which a femoral hernia frequently escapes; in other situations also, the fascia lata presents sma 1 foramina for the passage of veins or nerves to or from the integument. In some situations, and particu- arly on the outer side, the fascia lata may be divided into two laminee of fibres, the external of which take a cimilar or transverse course, the internal a longitudinal direction; opposite the hip-joint a deep process of ^ff''^^^ strength goes to be attached to the capsule of the joint and the outer head of the rectus muscle; the fascia lata binds down the muscles and vessels of the thigh, aff-ording points of attachment to some of the former. Wounds of the fascia lata, particularly those of a P"nctured nature are frequently followed by a severe inflammatjon beneath the fascia; sometimes, but rarely, this occurs without '^ny ^^^^ evident cause. In such cases, should the inflammation not

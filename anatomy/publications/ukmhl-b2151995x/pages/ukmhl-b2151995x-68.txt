52 ANATOMY. additional insertion or attachment to the external inter- articular cartilage. The two semilunar or inter-articulur cartilages are oval-shaped, flattened bodies, of a fibro-cartilaginous structure, placed between the condyles of the femur and the tibia, but more intimately connected with the latter than the former ; they are called external and internal. The exterrial semilunar cartilage is somewhat circular ; it is shorter from before backwards than the internal, but is wider transversely ; its anterior extremity is implanted into the rough surface in front of the spine of the tibia; its posterior extremity is inserted into the rough surface be- hind the spine; its outer edge corresponds to the tendon of the popliteus muscle, and to the external inferior articular artery, which intervenes between it and the external lateral ligament. The internal semilunar cartilage is oval in shape, and longer than the external; has its anterior extremity attached to the rough surface in front of the spine of the tibia; its posterior extremity is inserted into the rough surface behind the spine, its outer edge is firmly connected with the internal lateral ligament. These cartilages, like the crucial ligaments, differ in almost every particular, as may be collected from the preceding description. The use of these cartilages is to present a deep excavation for the reception of the condyles of the femur, to adapt themselves to the different surfaces of the femur in contact with them in flexion and extension, and to lessen the effects ot shocks; the internal one, although more fixed, is more hable to displacement than the external: we may explain this, by the greater weight of the joint being thrown on the inner side, in consequence of the oblique direction ot the femur and the greater depth of the internal condyle, and by the fact of its being more fixed, preventing it from following the condyle of the femur so completely as the external. The synovial membrane is the most extensive m the body, and the most liable to disease ; it lines the joint generally, is reflected upon both surfaces of the cartdages, and ascends a considerable distance-upon the anterior surface of the femur, and only covers the crucial ligaments ^^The^ Anee-ioinf belongs to the class imperfect Angular

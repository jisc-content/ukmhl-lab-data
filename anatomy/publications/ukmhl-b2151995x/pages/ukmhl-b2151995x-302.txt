Posteriorly to the parotid gland, the cervical fascia becomes indistinct, and is lost, as already described The cervical fascia is of use in forming a covering tor tne lateral surface of the neck, in binding down the cervical muscles and vessels for which it forms sheaths. In a practical point of view it is of mucli Si number of glands in the neck, this region is frequently the seat ofTbscesses^nd other tumours. When ^^^^.-^^^^^^f ™ ^^^^^^^^^ the fascia, they are resisted by it from breaking externally, they xriU ther;fore!if not given exit to by the knife of the surgeon, Sowbetath the fas'cia, andfinally openat som^^^^^^^^^ where the fascia is less strong, thus forming ^'^use. di tressmg to the patient, and difficult of cure. Our practice shc^uldbeto open these abscesses early, and thus prevent ^^ch mischief takmg Xce In cases of tumours of a more chronic character forming Keath the cervical fascia, whether enlargement of the glands or aneurismal swellings, the fascia will have a s'-Jar effect restraining them from commg to the surface and ^ ^"^^^^ °J aneurism mav render their pulsation somewhat indistinct, une remaSle effect is produced by the existence of tumours be- neath tbcervcal fascia, namely, difficulty of ^hing some- toes amounting to suffocation, caused by the tense condition of hTflscTa resisti'ng the free motion of the larynx and trachea and flnubtless also by the mechanical pressure of such tumours on Se impoSnt'parts, as well as by the sy^^patbetic a^^^ communicated to the laryngeal muscles. uractice is to remove the swelbngs by appropriate treatment, h thev be caused by a collection of pus, this should be given exit to tyl free diSon of the fascia; but if by an aneurismal tumour the arterv should be tied, or some other means adopted for re UevinJ the patient.

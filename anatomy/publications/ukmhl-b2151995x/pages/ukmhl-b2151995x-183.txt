CEREBRAL NERVES. 167 panding, forms the semilunar ganglion, or Casserian plexus, which rests on the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and part of the sphenoid bone. From this plexus three trunks are given ofi", the ophthalmic, superior, and inferior maxillary. The ophthalmic trunk, the smallest of the three, and niost mternal, runs along the inner side of the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, below the thii-d and fourth nerves communicating slightly with the cavernous plexus, then separates into three branches, which perforate the dura mater separately, to enter the orbit by the sphenoidal fissure,—they are the following : 1. 1\xt lachTymal branch, smallest and lowest of the three, passes between the orbit and external rectus, to be distributed to the lachry- r^l! w '• Tl,'^"*''"''.

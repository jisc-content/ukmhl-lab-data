ERYSIPELAS. 737 wool, blue ointment, a solution of sesquicarbonate of am- monia, solution of sulphate of iron, and two others which I have recommended most, viz., decoction of quince seed, with a small quantity of extract of belladonna, to be painted cold over the part, and the other is the solution of nitrate of silver as recommended and successfully employed by Mr. Higginbottom; his solution is made with a scruple of nitrate of silver to a drachm of water, with two or three drops of dilute nitric acid,â€”this is to be applied with a brush over all the part affected, and a little beyond it; the painful smarting soon abates, and often in twenty-four hours there appears to be an arrest of the inflammation, and the constitutional symptoms abate likewise ; the chief objection to it is the temporary disfigurement, which will disappear, however, in the course of about a fortnight or three weeks. If abscesses form under the skin, they should be opened. Phlegmonous Erysipelas is a severe form of disease, attacking not only the skin, but the cellular tissue beneath, and sometimesextending to the fasciae, tendons, and muscles. It is almost always consequent upon mechanical injury, and is more frequent in hospitals than in private practice. There is much constitutional disturbance, as in the former variety ; the part affected becomes enormously swollen, red, tense, and shining, with a hard brawny feel; vesications may show themselves; then copious effusion of fluid of a sanious ichorous matter beneath the skin ensues, the red colour of the surface disappears, and is replaced by a pale mottled, hard appearance; the skin pits on pressure, and presents a doughy, boggy feel; the constitutional symptoms take on now a lower type, and irritative fever sets in, which, with the mischief going on under the skin, soon kills the patient. The treatment at first may be mildly antiphlo- gistic, but general bloodletting is hardly admissible; the parts may be fomented; free incision should be made in the early stage to empty the vessels and take off tension, and in more advanced stages to allow the escape of the sanious matter, pus and sloughs, and thus preventing an extension of the disease. The bowels should be well opened at the commencement, and then the patient's stren"-th must be supported by tonics and plenty of nourishment. The peculiarity of this iuflaramation is, that, the fluid effused does not contain healthy pus, nor is lymph thrown out to

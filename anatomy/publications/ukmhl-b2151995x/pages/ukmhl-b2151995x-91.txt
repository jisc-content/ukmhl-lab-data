STEKNO-CLAVICULAE ARTICULATION. 75 the synovial membrane of the articulation into two sacs, an internal and external; when imperfect, as it is sometimes in the centre, the two synovial sacs become continuous. The synovial membrane also hnes the inner surface of the ligaments immediately connected with the joint. This articulation belongs to the class Arthrosis. As we pass outwards, we find that the clavicle is con- nected by ligaments with the first rib and the coracoid process of the scapula, without forming any articulation ; the first of these we meet with is the costo-coracoid ligament; it is called also the costo-clavicular ligament, or the licjamentum hicorne; it is exceedingly variable as to size, shape, and thickness. It is attached internally by means of a strong well-marked band of fibres to the cartilage, upper edge, and outer-surface of the body of the first rib; some of its fibres pass inwards, but the greater number are directed upwards and outwards, and are implanted into the under surface of the clavicle, dividino- as It passes outwards into two layers, which enclose the subclavius muscle, and finally are inserted into the coracoid process of the scapula: the layer which covers the anterio*- surface of the muscle is much better marked than that covermg the posterior surface. Internally and externally this ligament is in general well defined, but becomes thiii and aponeurotic in the centre; its inferior edge is free, lunated, directed backwards, and corresponds with the axillary vein ; its internal extremity is sometimes described as a distinct ligament, under the name of rhomboid. It is this ligament which renders it difficult to compress the artery immediately below the clavicle. External to this ligament, and near its outer extremity we meet with the ligaments connecting the clavicle with the coracoid process of the scapula; these are named co«o/rf Hgamenr^'' ' conjointly named the coraco-clavicular 'l\x^\onoid is of a conical shape; its base turned "pwards, ,s attached to a tubercle on the undrsur ace of he clavicle; its apex directed downwards, is insertedTnto he posterior expanded portion of the coracoid process ; i? ^^^^^^^^ ^•^^ ^^^^-^ ^^-cends The trapezoid ligament is of a quadrilateral slmiie.

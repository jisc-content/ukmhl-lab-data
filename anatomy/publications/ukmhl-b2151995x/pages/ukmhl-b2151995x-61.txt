THE HIP-JOINT. 45 most anterior, ungual. The metatarsal phalanges are the longest and largest, concave at the posterior extremity, convex at the anterior, rough on their under surface and sides, for the attachment of ligaments, covered by the expansion of the tendons of the extensor muscles, laterally by the tendons of the interossei and lumbricales, and inferiorly grooved for the flexor tendons. The middle phalanges give attachment laterally and inferiorly to the tendons of the flexor brevis. The middle phalanx may be said to be wanting in the great toe. The ungual phalanx is small and triangular, largest in the great toe; rough at the anterior extremity, for the attachment of the nails, and the expansion of the tendons of the extensor longus and flexor longus digitorum. The first phalanx belongs to the class of long bones the others consist chiefly of spongy tissue; they are gene- raHy developed from one ossific centre, with an epiphysis at the posterior or dorsal end of each.

GLUTEAL REGION. 3[)3 ■ the ischium, and enters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic uotcb, ascends forwards and inwards along the inner side of the tuber ischii, and the ramus of the ischium, and pubis, and is lost in the perineum and the organs of generation. Each of these arteries is accompanied by a corresponding vein which terminates in the internal iliac vein The principal nerves are the superior gluteal, the greater and lesser sciatic, and pudic. The superior gluteal nerve is a branch of the lumbo-sacral; it passes out with the gluteal artery, and is lost in the gluteal muscles. The lesser sciatic or inferior gluteal nerve, is a branch of the sacral plexus; it passes out with the sciatic and pudic arteries, and soon divides into three branches: first, the gluteal is distributed to the gluteal muscles; the second, the pudic branch, winds round the tuber ischii and is lost in the integuments of the perineum and scrotum; the third, the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh descends, perfo- rates the fascia lata, and is lost in the integument cover- ing the back of the thigh, reaching as far down as the popliteal space; the pudic nerve is also a branch of the sacral plexus, and accompanies the pudic artery. The great sciatic nerve is the terminating branch of the sacral plexus • It escapes from the pelvis through the lower part of the great sciatic notch along with the sciatic and pudic arteries below the pyriformis, or sometimes between its fibres- descends between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter but nearer the former with the sciatic artery, restino- on the superior gemellus, the obturator internus, the inferior gemellus, and the quadratus femoris, covered by the glu taeus maximus, and surrounded by a large quantity of loose cellular tissue; it then descends between the biceps and semitendinosus muscles and enters the popliteal space where it terminates by dividing into two large trunks the internal and external popliteal nerves, which shaU be de- scribed when we consider that region. The great .ciatic nerve, as it descends in the thigh, sends off several bran h to the surrounding muscles and integuments Along the back of the thigh we meet with the three foUowing muscles, biceps, semitendinosus, semimembra- nosus; these three muscles, together with the gracil , for, the hamstring muscles. ^ v-iuo, luu . rm 17§

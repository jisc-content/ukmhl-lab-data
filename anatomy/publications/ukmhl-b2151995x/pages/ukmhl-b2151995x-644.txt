There is usually also present a dull, heavy pain, and weakness in the region afi'ected ; and the digestive and respiratory organs ai'e incapable of discharg- ing their functions perfectly. If the patient be placed on the face, and the spine ex- amined, by striking with a moderate degree of force each spinous process; or, what is better, by moving each from side to side he will instantly wince wiien the diseased part is handled, and at the same time complains of pains shoot- ing in the course of the spinal marrow and principal nerves. This, which may be considered as the first or inflamma- tory stage of the disease, is characterised at a somewhat later period by a peculiar state of the limbs, termed palsy, and induced by the inflanimation having spread to the spinal marrow and membranes ; in this, the muscles are rigid, and almost always in a tonic state, by which the knees and ankles acquire a stiffness not easily overcome. By means of this stiflPness, mixed with a kind of spasm, the legs of the patient are either constantly kept stretched out, in which case considerable force is requn-ed to bend them, or they are drawn across each other, so as to be with difficulty separated. When the limbs are forcibly bent, the legs are suddenly drawn up with the heels towards the btittocks. The feet are forcibly extended, so that the patient cannot put the heels to the ground. There may be also at this time retention of urine, and, if the sulijett be a male, shooting pains along the spermatic cord, with occasional retraction of the testes.

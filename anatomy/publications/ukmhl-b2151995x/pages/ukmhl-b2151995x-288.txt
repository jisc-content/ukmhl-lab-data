272 ANATOMY. corpus cavernosum commences by a narrow-pointed or sometimes obtuse extremity, which is attached to the inner surface of the tuber ischii, and rami of the ischium and pubes, whence, passing forwards and inwards, it ter- minates in the corpus cavernosum; this immediately unites with the corpus cavernosum from the opposite side ; the two, thus united, pass forwards, and terminate behind the glans penis in a blind obtuse extremity. The corpora cavernosa are covered externally by a dense fibrous, whitish, elastic membrane, of some thickness; this sends in, on the mesial line, an imperfect septum, the septum pectiniforme, which partially separates the two bodies, but at the same time allows of a communication between their cells, particularly anteriorly. Numerous processes are given off from this coat to the interior, uader the name of traheeulcB, to support and conduct the vessels. In the interior of this fibrous covering is an erectile spongy tissue, of a reddish colour, supposed by some to be com- posed of a congeries of arteries and veins; by others of cells, into which the blood is poured during the erection of the organ, whence it is afterwards removed by the veins. A pecuhar set of arteries, which terminate in dilated ex- tremities {helicine arteries), have been described by some. Between the corpora cavernosa, superiorly, a groove exists, in which the dorsal vessels and nerves of the penis run ; a similar groove is seen on the under surface, in which is lodged the corpus spongiosum urethra. This body completes the penis, and has been described with the urethra; it is covered externally by a fibrous membrane, which is de- rived from the triangular ligament of the urethra, \yithm which is the spongy erectile tissue of the organ; this is of a dark colour, and is composed chiefly of veins ; it is con- tinued anteriorly in front of the extremity of the corpora cavernosa, where it expands and forms the glans penis: this body, conical in shape, is attached at its base to the anterior part of the corpora cavernosa by cellular tissue ; it presents here a circular indentation, the cervix, in front of which is a projecting ridge, the corona glandis; these parts contain a number of sebaceous glands, the glandule odo- rifercE, or Tijsoni. The cells of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum urethrse do not communicate. The penis is supplied with blood by branches of the internal pudic arteries, as follows : 1st, arteries dorsales penis, run

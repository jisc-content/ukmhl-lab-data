.535 CONGENITAL HERNIA. HERNIA OF THE C^CUM. The ceecum has been found in an inguinal hernia. As this intestine wants the peritoneum posteriorly, this sur- face of it contracts adhesions to the scrotum, and cannot be returned. When operating upon it, the peritoneum which the in- testine has brought along with it, and which lies in front and to its inner side, must be cut through before it can be exposed. It is at once known by the appendix vermi- formis. It is possible that the posterior surface of the caecum may present itself first to the surgeon, and thus the intestine be cut into in mistake for one of its co- verings; the direction of the muscular fibres may point out the nature of the affection. HERNIA OF THE BLADDER, OB, CYSTIC HERNIA. When the bladder protrudes in a hernia, there is no hernial sac; this viscus merely brings the peritoneum with it, which is related to it as in the natural state. We are not aware that any operation has been found necessary in such cases. CONGENITAL HERNIA. This form of hernia is a modification of oblique inguinal hernia: it takes place in consequence of the tunica vao-i- nahs not having been obliterated at its superior part. The hernia thus descends into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, where it lies in close contact with and beneath the testis! It is evident from this that no distinct hernial sac exists. In order to explain this more fully, it must be recol- lected that the testis, at the early periods of foetal life, is an abdominal viscus. It commences its descent, or more properly speaking ascent, towards the scrotum, at the beginning of the sixth month, makes its way gradually along the inguinal canal, guided by the gubernaculum testis, and finally arrives in the scrotum, shortly before or It may be, after birth. ' ' From the partial covering which the gland receives from the peritoneum. It carries with it a duplicature of this membrane, which, in after life, is known as the tunica vaginalis.

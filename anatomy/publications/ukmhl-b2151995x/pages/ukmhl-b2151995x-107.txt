BONES OF THE HEAD. 91 and one for tlje zygoma. At birtli it usiialljr consists of three parts: one includes the zygoma and squamous, another the petrous and mastoid portions, and the third tympanic, surrounding the membrana tympaui.

The Sphenoid bone consists of a body, great and small wings, and pterygoid processes. The cerebral surface of the body presents an ethmoid process, the olivary process, and on each side the optic foramen; behind these the sella turcica, bounded by the anterior and posterior clinoid processes; on each side, lateral grooves for the carotid artery of each side : the posterior surface is rough, to join the basilar process of the occipital bone. The ate rainores extend laterally, and partly support the anterior lobes of the brain : their pos- terior edge corresponds with the fissure of Sylvius. The alse majores have three surfaces, cerebral, orbital, and temporal; the cerebral forms part of the middle fossa of the cranium, and is marked by the convolutions of the brain and branches of the middle meningeal artery in this part we notice the foramen rotundum, the foramen ovale, the foramen spinosum, and spinous process, and projectmg mferiorly the styloid process. Laterally is the temporal surface, forming part of the temporal fossa. * ^ wafoatet^r^'"'^^ P"""^ '^™^ P^^-^ '"^^ The parts seen on the under surface are the pterygoid havi^l°;b^'r'''T' "^'^ "^^^••'^^1' i'^'ier one having the hamular process at its lower extremity; at

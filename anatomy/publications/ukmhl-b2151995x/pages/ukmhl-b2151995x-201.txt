185 LUMBAR NERVES. the fifth and a twig from the fourth; it passes down to the pelvis, and unites with the first sacral, so as to contribute to form the sacral plexus. The only nerve given off from it is the superior gluteal nerve, which passes out by the sacro-sciatic notch, with the gluteal artery, and is distributed to the gluteal muscles, and tensor vaginae femoris. The sacral nerves are six on each side, each consisting of an anterior and posterior branch; they arise from the Cauda equina, and emerge from tbe sacral foramina. The four superior posterior branches pass out at the posterior sacral foramina, perforate the tendon of the sacro-lunabaUs and become superficial, and are distributed to the skin covering the nates. The inferior posterior branches run downwards to supply the integuments about the anus. The anterior branches pass out at the sacral foramina, decreasing in size as they come out, from above downwards. They all communicate with the sacral gangha of the sym- pathetic. The three superior nerves, with descending branches from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, ^nd a branch from the fourth sacral, form the sacral plexus. The fourth nerve gives filaments to the hypogastric plexus, levator ani, coccygeus, the skin above the anus, and sphincter ani. The fifth and sixth sacral nerves are very small, and are lost in the coccygeus and sphincter ani. The sacral plexus, formed as above mentioned, rests upon the pyriformis muscle, and gives off internal and external branches. The internal branches are— Muscular, Hajmorrlioidal, Vaginal, Uterine, Vesical, Pudic. The external branches are— Great Sciatic, Small Sciatic. The muscular twigs are distributed to the pyriformis, obturator internus, gemelli, and quadratus femoris. The hcemorrhoidal branches pass to the muscular and mucous coat of the rectum, and communicate with the neighbouring nerves. The vaginal and uterine branches ramify, as their names imply. The vesical branches pass to the lower part of the

THE MOUTH, PHARYNX, AND (ESOPHAGUS. 21.9 iuferiorly, it teraiinates in the oesophagus, opposite the fifth cervical vertebra. Internally it consists of mucous membrane, on the outside of which are the muscles which chiefly form its parietes. They are the superior, middle, and inferior constrictors of each side; accessory to them are the stj/lo- pharyngeus and palato-pharyngeus. In addition to these parts, Cruveilhier describes a membranous or aponeurotic layer, which consists of two portions, named cephalo- pharyngeal and petro-pharyngeal. Posteriorly it serves as a pomt of attachment to the pharyngeal muscles The mucous membrane is furnished at 'its upper part, with cihated and columnar epithelium. The inferior constrictor most superficial, overlapping the middle constrictor, partially arises from two or three rings of the trachea, and from the sides of the cricoid and thy- roid cartilage, it passes backwards to be inserted into the posterior tendinous raphe of the pharynx. The middle constrictor arises from the cornua of the OS hyoides, and slightly from the stylo-hyoid ligament, rom which points its fibres spread out to be inserted, the ower and middle into the raphe, and the superior, by a tendmous prolongation, into the basUar process of the occipital bone Its superior border overlaps the superior cons nctor, whdst its inferior is overlapped by the inferior constrictor. j.i j Ihe superior constrictor of the pharynx arises, slightly from the side of the tongue, from the molar ridge of the inferior maxilla, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament, and fiom the internal pterygoid plate and hamular proce s • it passes backwards to be inserted into the central raph6 of the pharynx, and into the basilar process. Its lower portion IS overlapped by the middle constrictor Ihe stylo-phanjngeus arises from the styloid process The palato-pharyngeus arises from the soft palate «nrl passes downwards to be inserted into ^-a \ , pharynx, and sHghtly into the tiyro/fcUte"'^ There are seven openings into the phar;nz, viz., two

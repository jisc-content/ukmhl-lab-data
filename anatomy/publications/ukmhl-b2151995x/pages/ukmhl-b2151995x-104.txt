88 ANATOMY. anterior-superior, anterior-inferior, posterior-superior, pos- terior-inferior; its edges are uamed coronal, sagittal, lam- boidal, and squamous. Externally there is a prominence about the centre, showinP- its single point of ossification; a temporal ridge forming part of the origin of the temporal muscle ; and a parietal foramen, for the transmission of a vem to the superior longitudinal sinus. Its internal surface presents a groove along the sagittal mar-in for the superior longitudinal sinus ; a ridge for the falx"^ little pits for the Pacchionian glands; arborescent erooVes for the middle meningeal artery, which commences at the anterior-inferior angle, sometimes forming a foramen; a depression near the posterior-inferior angle for the lateral sinus; and eminences and depressions corresponding with the convolutions of the brain. . Each parietal is articulated with five bones, viz , the frontal, temporal, sphenoid, occipital, and with its feUow. Muscle attached, Temporalis. OS OCCIPITIS. The Occipital bone is diamond-shaped, and consists of a broad superior portion, two condyles, and the basilar ^Â°?r eiSnaTposterior surface, convex, presents, the occipital protuberance, which gives attachment to the Sentuia nuch., the perpendicular spine, the superior and inferior transverse ridges, and, lower down, the occi- i for men; and on each side of this the coiidyles Sresenting ridges and inequalities laterally, m front, and behind, for the attachment of ligaments and muscles. Ju t behind the condyles are the posterior condyloid foramina, and in front the anterior condyloid foramina. The basilar process connects the occipital with the '^T^'l W surface of this bone presents the crucial spine with depressions for the superior longitudinal occi- and lateral sinuses, Nvith ridges of attachment for the ?ak niaior and minor, and tentorium; above the trans- verse ridge depressions for the cerebrum, below it for he c bel um, jugular notches, where this bone, with the

PHYSIOLOGY. 418 the saliva, and by not containing any of the sulphocyanide of potassium. Bile is a fluid of a yellowish-green colour darkening by exposure to the air. It has a disagreeable odour, a nauseous bitter taste, is distinctly alkaline, and mixes with water in all proportions. The most recent analyses represent it as composed of water, colouring matter, cholesterine, choleic acid, and soda. The cholesterine being however in very small proportion, it may be considered essentially as a choleate of soda. Gall stones consist of adipocire and cholesterine, with a small quantity of salts and colouring matter. Chyle differs but little from the blood as regards its composition and properties, containing a fluid or plasma, and numerous semitransparent white corpuscles. Like the blood it coagulates, but much less firmly and more slowly. It owes its white colour to numerous fat globules suspended in the liquid. The same phenomenon has been sometimes observed in the blood itself. Chyle appears to be blood in an early stage of formation. Milk is a semi-opaque white fluid, with a slight odour, and a sweetish agreeable taste. It consists of a transparent fluid or plasma and transparent corpuscles, the colour of the fluid depending on the peculiar refraction of light. In its composition it forms a type of a perfect food, as it contains an azotised material (caseine), and two non- azotised, the one fatty, the other saccharine. Among the salts which it contains, the most important is the phos- phate of lime, which is required for the bones of the young animal, and is held in solution by the caseine. The caseine of milk is held in solution by the presence of a small quantity of soda. In 1000 parts, cow's milk contains : Water . • • Caseine . Milk-sugar Butter .

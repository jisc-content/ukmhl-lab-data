40 ANATOMY, thus be divided, like the carpus, into a posterior and an anterior row of bones. Tlae Astragalus, second in size, is situated in the su- perior and internal part of the tarsus, and nearly in its centre, between the tibia above, the malleoli on either side, the os calcis inferiorly and posteriorly, and the na- vicular bone anteriorly. It is divided into the body, neck, and head; the body of the astragalus occupies the pos- terior part of the bone ; superiorly it presents a smooth cartilaginous surface for articulation with the tibia, nsirro'wer posteriorly than anteriorly, its outer edge higher than its inner; on each side of this is an articulating surface, one internal somewhat pyriform, with its larger extremity Jbrwards, for the internal malleolus ; the other external, triangular with its base above, larger than the internal, for the external malleolus. Inferiorly the astra- galus presents two articulating surfaces; a -posterior one, large and external, rests on the body of the os calcis; an anterior one internal, much smaller, rests on the sus- tentaculum of the same boneâ€”these two articular surfaces are separated by a deep groove, which only transmits vessels and gives lodgment to an interosseous ligament. Pos- teriorly the astragalus is of small extent, and is marked by a deep groove, which gives lodgment to the tendon of the flexor longus poUicis, and into the edges of which the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint is implanted. The neck is the most contracted part of the bone, placed in front of the body and behind the head; it is exceed- ingly rough and porous for the transmission of vessels, and is not marked by any articular surface; the head of the astragalus is placed in front of the neck, directed obliquely Vorwards and inwards ; it is marked anteriorly by an oblong articular surface, which is received into the OS naviculare in front, and is prolonged inferiorly into an articular surface, which is supported by the calcaneo- navicular ligament. The astragalus articulates with four bones: the tibia above and internally, the ?ih\x\& exter- nally, the OS calcis inferiorly, and the os naviculare anteriorly. No muscle is attached to this bone. The Os Calcis is the largest bone of the tarsus, placed between the astragalus, wl)ich is superior, and the os cuboides, anterior to it, so situated as to support nearly the

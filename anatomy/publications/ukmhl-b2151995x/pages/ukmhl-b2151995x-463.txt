SUE GEE Y. ON INFLAMMATION. Inflammation is an abnormal or altered action in the vessels of any part, commonly attended with i-edness, pain, heat, and swelling, and with more or less constitutional disturbance. The Redness is caused by a greater quantity of blood being sent to the part, occasioned by the increased action of the arteries ; and, in some situations, as in the con- junctiva, by the dilated vessels allowing of the circulation of an increased number of the red globules of the blood, where it was formerly the opinion that they (the red glo- bules) had no passage. Some anatomists believe that there exist in the body minute vessels which only convey the watery portion of the blood, and name them vasa non rubra, and that in inflammation they become distended, and thereby admit also the red corpuscles and become visible; others deny the existence of such vessels, and state that when the red globules pass through in single file, the vessels are not ordinarily visible, but if by disten- sion of the vessels the globules pass two or three abreast, the vessels then are easily perceptible. The capillaries of an inflamed part are in a state of passive distension or debiUty, although the arteries at a little distance are acting with increased impetus. Fain is caused by an increased degree of sensibility in the nerves of the part, either from their participating in the inflammation, or from the distended adjacent parts compressing and stretching the nervous filaments. Heat.â€”Q)x applying the thermometer to an inflamed part, the temperature is found to be a few degrees hio-her than in the healthy parts of the same body. This is pro-

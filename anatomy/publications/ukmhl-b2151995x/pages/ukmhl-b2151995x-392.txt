376 REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. The sphincter ani muscle is seen to surround the lower extremity of the rectum, and thus closes the anus, except during the expulsion of the faeces. In the operation of lithotomy, a few of the lateral fibres of this muscle, if well developed, are cut across. The operation for the cure ot fistula in ano consists in dividing the sphincter am muscle, in cutting through the fistula, as the contraction ot the muscular fibres is the chief impediment to the heahng ot the sinus. Dupuytren recommended the division ot the muscle, for the relief of those painful fissures which occasionally form in the margin of the anus. The deep sphincter ani lies above the preceding, and encircles the lower extremity of the rectum; it is formed by the muscular fibres of the intestine and those of the levator ani, which here take a circular course. ^ ■ , • On removing the superficial fascia, the superficial peri- neal fascia is brought into view : this is a dense layer of fascia, which invests the muscles of the perineum ; on each side it is firmly attached to the ramus of the ischmm and pubis ; anteriorly, it is continuous with the fascia of ?he scrotum, posteriorly it is lost on the anterior surface of the rectum, where it becomes cou muous ^"h the posterior edge or base of the triangular ligament. When Ltravasation of urine takes place into Perineum, from rupture of the urethra, the attachments of the fascia prevent the fluid from passing either laterally or pos- teriorly; consequently it is forced forwai-ds into the cellular tissue o the scrotum whence it ascends on the abdominal panetes In making our incisions m perineo to aUow ot the escape of the fluid, the perineal fascia should be freely lid d When abscesses form in perineo the resistance of he fascia renders it difiicult to ascertain the fluctuation of Z matter: hence collections of matter here have been nrS; Uret^petial perineal fascia, the muscles and principal vessels and nerves of the perineum and the Sriie, contained in the anterior part of the permeum whilst the rectum and the sphincter ani muscles occupy ur«osterior portion.

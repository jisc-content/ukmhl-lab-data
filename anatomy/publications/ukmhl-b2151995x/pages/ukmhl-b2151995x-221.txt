THE EAR. 205 gracilis of the malleus, and passage to the chorda tympani uerve and tendon of the laxator tympani muscle, a minute artery and vein. Anteriorly and internally we observe the orifices for the Eustachian tube, and tensor tympani muscle. Within the tympanum is a chain of sma^ll bones, named ossicula auditus. They are the malleus, incus, orbiculare, and stapes. The malleus, (a hammer,) in relation with the membrana tympani, consists of a head, neck, and processes. The head articulates with the incus; the neck is between this and the processes; the tnanubrhm (handle) is a lono- process, connected by its extremity with the membrana tympani. The processus brevis is external, passes from the neck at a right angle, and rests against the membrana tympani. The processus gracilis proceeds from the neck, forwards and downwards, and is inserted by its point into the glenoid fissure. The incus (an anvil) may be divided into a body and processes. The body is anterior, and is articulated at its upper part with tlie head of the malleus. Its short crus, or process, is directed backwards, and retires into the mastoid cells; its long process, or crus, passes forwards, downwards, and inwards, terminating in a rounded point, which has been named, as a separate bone, the os or- biculare, by which it is articulated with the stapes. The stapes (a stirrup) is said to consist of a base processes, a neck, and head. The head is articulated with themcus; the wec/L-has the stapedius muscle attached to It; Va^processes pass from the neck to the base, and have a delicate membrane filling up the space between them • the base of an oval form fills up or occupies the openine' named fenestra-ovalis. °' These bones admit of some motion, which are influenced by some minute muscles, the smallest in the body Thev are four in number, ^' The Tensor tympani arises from— '\2Z boSr "'■"'''^^ "'^ tube and and is inserted into— the processus brevis of the malleus.

ANEURISM. 659 some â– will be met with to which^it is not strictly ap- plicable. Thus large aneurisms, after some time, lose their pulsation, in consequence of the interior of the tumour becoming nearly filled with successive layers of coagulated blood, which have the effect of resisting the impulse of the artery, and thus prevent it from being dis- tinguished externally; an aneurism, formed by a dilatation of the capillary veins, does not possess any pulsation, and in the aneurismal varix no distinct tumour exists. In difi"used aneurism, the pulsation is either very indistinct or altogether wanting. Aneurisms are met with most frequently in the adult subject between the ages of thirty and fifty, and oftener in the male than in the female. Yet no age is whoUy exempt from them, as they have been met with before puberty, and in the old subject; indeed, the disease of aneurism by anastomosis does appear first at or imme- diately after birth, and a wound of a large artery at any period of life may be followed by the formation of an aneurismal tumour. The cause of the greater frequency of aneurism in the adult is the great liability there exists at this period of hfe to the deposition of steatomatous, atheromatous, or ossific matter between the internal and middle coats of the artery; this portion of the vessel bemg thus deprived of its elasticity, is more exposed to the impulse of the heart, and thus gives way either by bemg gradually distended, or by the rupture, first of the mternal, and then of the middle coat of the vessel, when the only remaining coat, the cellular, not being possessed of sufficient resistance, yields, and thus gives rise to the formation of a tumour. To this may be added, the greater exertion of the adult exposing the vessel to greater violence, and the disturbance of the circulation produced by mental or other afi-ections, more frequent at this period othte. In the young subject this diseased state of the vessels seldom exists; in the old subject the arterv has become so extensively diseased from the deposit of ossific matter, that the vessel at once gives way,^ud the blood being extravasated in large quantities into the sui- rounding parts, death ensues without the formation of any aneurism. Several divisions have been made of aneurism, varying

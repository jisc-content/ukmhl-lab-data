The under surface is divided into two by a ridge, the posterior part of which gives attachment to the calcaueo-cuboid ligament, the anterior lodges the tendon of the peroneus longus; internally there are two articulating surfaces—one, smaller and sometimes wanting, for the navicular, the other for the external cuneiform bone; posteriorly there is a large cartilaginous surface for articulation with the os calcis ; and anteriorly a large sur- face divisible by a slight ridge into two for articulation with the two external metatarsal bones. The cuboid articulates with four bones, the os calcis, external cuneiform, two metatarsal bones ; and sometimes with a fifth, viz., the navicular. Muscles attached: Abductor polUcis. Flexor brevis minimi digiti. The cuneiform bones are three, internal, middle, and external, and occupy nearly the centre of the foot. The internal cuiaeiform bone is the largest, and is thickest on its inferior aspect. It articulates by cartilaginous surfaces with four bones : anteriorly, with the metatarsal bone of the great toe. externally, with the second metatarsal bone, and with the second cuneiform bone. posteriorly, with the navicular bone. Muscles attached: Tibialis anticus. „ posticus. Peroneus longus. The middle cuneiform bone is the smallest of the three, and is wedged in between the two others; its dorsal surface is of a quadrangular shape, its apex is turned downwards, towards the sole of the foot. It articulates by cartilaginous surfaces with four bones: anteriorly, the second metatarsal bone. posteriorly, the navicular bone. externally, the external cuneiform bone. internally, the internal cuneiform. It has the tendon of the tibialis posticus slightly at- tached to it; also the flexor poUicis brevis. The external cuneiform bone, quadrangiilar on its dorsal surface, and rather oblong, is pointed mfenorly

COVERINGS OP THE HEAD. 281 the external periosteum is produced by iiiflararaation, and that too of a syphilitic character, producing a swelling, distinguished by the name of node; here, if the inflammation be not subdued necrosis of the outer table exposes the patient to a spreading of the inflammation to the dura mater, and may thus cause the death of the patient. The internal periosteum exerts more influenee over the vitality of the cranial bones than the external, as when the former becomes detached, either by disease or accident a part or the whole substance of the bone perishes, the external periosteum becomes detached from its outer surface, and a tumour forms from the discharge that attends these processes, containing a sanious fluid mixed with air—this is known as Pott's puffv tumour of the scalp. ^ ' The scalp possesses a high degree of organisation. It IS supplied with blood by the frontal, temporal, posterior aural and occipital arteries. The frontal arteries are branches from the ophthalmic; they escape from the cavity of the orbit, through the superciliary notch or foramen, along with the frontal nerves, and are lost in the auterior part of the scalp. The temporal arteries, one on each side, are derived from the external carotid, while in the substance of the parotid gland. They ascend, crossing the zygoma near its root, and immediately in front of the !nlnr iT'"' tliey send one branch to S/ / T^T^ ""f' '"•^ ^fter a short course, divide into two branches, an anterior and a posterior- w th the frontal artery, the posterior running backwards to join the posterior aural and occipital arteries.

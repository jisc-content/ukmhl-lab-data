The superior boundary of the inguinal canal is formed bv the lower margins of the internal oblique and trans- versal s muscles: these muscles are here intimately con- Tected, particularly as we approach the pubes; towards the ilium they are partially separated. Beneath the in- terna oblique! the spermatic cord may be seen to emerge as it descends; a few muscular fibres pass off alon^ - * it which form the cremaster muscle.

OSSA INNOMINATA, 25 parts seen are, posteriorly, a rough surface, for the attach- ment of the gluteus maximus; anterior to this a smooth surface, bounded by a slight crescentic ridge, which com- mences at the anterior superior spinous process, for the attachment of the gluteus medius; and beneath this a semicircular surface, for the gluteus minimus, on which is often seen a foramen for a nutritious artery; still lower, and somewhat anterior to the last, is a rough surface, for the attachment of the origin of the rectus and cotyloid ligament, and just below it the acetabulum. In the part of the OS innominatum, below the acetabulum, we notice the several parts of the os pubis and ischium, and between them the obturator foramen (the largest bony foramen in the body), giving attachment by its margin to the obturator hgament; above and internally is tlie angle of the pubis, passing downwards to the descending ramus of the pubis, and this lower down continuous within the ramus of the ischium : beneath this is the tuberosity of the ischium, a large bony prominence projecting inferiorly, and affording origin to several muscles: upon this we rest in a sitting posture : ascending from this towards the acetabulum, we meet with a deep groove, which gives lodgment to the obturator externus tendon. The internal surface of the os innominatum is divided into a superior and inferior part by a prominent ridge, termed the linea ileo-pectinea; the superior, called also the iliac fossa, is filled up by the iliacus internus muscle ; in it we perceive a large nutritious foramen. The linea ilea- * pectinea commences anteriorly sharp and prominent at the spine or tubercle of the pubis, from this, passes backwards and outwards, and then turns slightly inwards, and terminates at the junction of the sacrum and ilium, where it is rounded off; at its awfm'or extremity it gives attachment to Gimbernat's ligament, which occupies nearly an inch, then to the pectineus muscle and pectineal portion of the fascia lata for about an inch and a half, and from thence to its termination posteriorly, to the iliac fascia. The circumference of the os innominatum presents an exceedingly undulating hue; if we trace it along, com- mencing anteriorly at the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, we meet with the following objects:â€”first, the anterior supeiior spinous process .of the ilium, which 2

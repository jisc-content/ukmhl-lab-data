THE DURA MATER. 13g called suture, consequent upon the peculiar development of these bones. The sutures are named the lambdoidaL sagittal, coronal, and squamous, to which are added the additamentum suturm squamosa, and the additamentum sutur<B lamhdoidalis. In the young subject also, the frontal bone is divided vertically into two halves by a con- tinuation of the sagittal suture. These bones are not united before birth, their borders allowing a considerable amount of overlapping, and thus permitting a great alteration of the shape and size of the tota^ head during parturition. In the centre, there exists, at tHis time, a diamond-shaped interval between the two panetal bones and the two segments of the frontal bone, caUed the antenor fontanel, and posteriorly to this exists a triangular shaped interval, in the situation of the sub- sequent junction of the lambdoidal and sagittal sutures, called the posterior fontanel.

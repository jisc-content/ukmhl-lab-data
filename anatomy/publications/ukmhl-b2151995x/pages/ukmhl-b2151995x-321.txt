DIGASTRIC OR SUPRA-HYOID REGION. 305 forwards, along its under surface, to its anterior extremity where it terminates. Before it reaches the hyo-glossus muscle, the lingual artery is covered externally by the integuments, platysma, and fascia, and near the cornu of the OS hyoides by the tendon of the digastricus; it rests on the superior laryngeal nerve, and some cellular substance, and near the os hyoides on the middle constrictor of the pharynx; the lingual nerve lies superficial and a little superior to it. Beneath the hyo-glossus it is covered, in addition to the fibres of this muscle, by the mylo-hyoid, aud rests on a few fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus. Beyond the hyo-glossus, it is again joined by the lingual nerve, wmch terminates with it in the tongue. The principal branches of the hngual artery are the following: •' Arteria dorsalis lingua arises beneath the hyo-glossus muscle, runs outwards to the side of the tongue, winds round, and reaches its dorsal surface, where it terminates, anastomosing with its fellow of the opposite side. In its course this artery sends branches to itsrof brirher' ^'^'^ -pp"^'^^^ ^ At the anterior margin of the hyo-glossus, the lingual artery divides into its two terminating branches, the sub- lingual and the ranine, Arteria mblingualis runs forwards and outwards to the subungual gland.

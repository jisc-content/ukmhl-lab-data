ANATOMY. 260 The riglit brancli gives off the cystic artery, which divides into two branches on reaching the gall-bladder; one of them runs superficially, the other deeply, between the gall-bladder and the liver. The superior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta, about half an inch below the cceliac axis ; it passes down- wards and forwards between the pancreas and duodenum, and then arrives at the mesentery, between the folds of which it descends obliquely towards the right iliac fossa, thus forming an arch, the convexity of which looks down- wards to the left, the concavity upwards to the right. From the convexity from fifteen to twenty branches are given off, named rami mesenterici; in the mesentery these anastomose togetlier and divide into branches, which branches also anastomose together, and subdivide again, thus forming a series of arches three or four in number, and arrive at the small intestines in a minute state of division. From the concavity there is first given off, just below the pancreas, a small branch, which anastomoses with the pancreatico-duodenahs; next the colica media, which passes forwards to the transverse colon, supplying it with branches; then the colica dextra, which passes trans- versely to the ascending colon ; and lowest down the iho- colica, which gives branches to the first portion of the colon, the caecum, and vermiform appendage, and anas- tomoses freely with the lower rami mesenterici. All the colic branches anastomose freely together. ^ The capsular arteries arise next, are small in size, ana uncertain in their origin; they pass obhquely to the renal capsules, which they supply, and anastomose with the diaphragmatic arteries. The renal arteries come off next from the sides ot the aorta, almost at a right angle, a Uttle below the superior mesenteric; they are of a large size, pass directly to the kidneys, but, before entering them, divide into five or six branches, part of which pass in front of, part posterior to, the pelvis of the kidney. The spermatic arteries proceed rather from the front ol the aorta; they are small, long, and somewhat tortuous vessels, most so in the female; they pass down on the psoEe muscles, in front of the ureter, and cross the ex- ternal iliac arterv, and at the internal abdominal ring

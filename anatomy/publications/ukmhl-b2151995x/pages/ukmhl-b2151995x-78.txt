The Humerus, or os-humeri, belongs to the class of long bones, and may be divided into its upper extremity or head, its neck, body or shaft, and lower extremity. The head is a round hemispherical convex eminence, incrusted with cartilage, and forms with the glenoid cavity of the scapula the shoulder-joint; it is connected to the shaft of the bone by the anatomical neck of the humerus, a rough irregular depression immediately external to the head, narrow superiorly, wide and expanded inferiorly, which gives insertion to the capsular ligament of the joint: the head is placed on the posterior and inner part of the bone, the shaft of which it joins so as to form an obtuse angle inferiorly. External, and anterior to the neck, we observe two eminences, a larger and smaller, separated by a groove: they are called the tuberosities of the humerus, the larger being the external or posterior; the smaller the internal or anterior. The former of these is placed on the outer side of the bone, is round and marked by three flat sur- faces ; a superior, middle, and inferior, for the attachments respectively of the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres minor muscles. The smaller tuberosity is situated towards the inner side, is sharp and more projecting, and gives attachment to but one muscle, the subscapularis: these tuberosities may be compared to the trochanters of the

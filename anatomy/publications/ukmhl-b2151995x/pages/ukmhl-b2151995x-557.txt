FEMORAL HERNIA. 541 this region, the saphena vein is much exposed. It may be avoided by not prolonging our incisions too much inwards. Not unfrequently it becomes varicose, aud may be mistaken for a femoral hernia. The nerves met with in the superficial fascia are small branches derived principaUy from the genito-crural aud anterior-crural. The hjmphatic glands compose the inferior set of in guinal glands They are arranged iu the vertical direction and consist of two sets, a superficial and deep. The mper ficial are three or four in number, and are inclosed ia a capsule of the superficial fascia. The deep are two or three in number: they accompany the femoral vessels- one is almost constantly lodged in the femoral ring Enlargement of these may be mistaken for a femoral bernia, and, from their relation to the femoral artery for an aneurism of this vessel. Dissect off the superficial fascia. This may be accom- phshed with ease, untU we arrive opposite the cribll^n fascia; here the two are so intimately connected, thatl IheXr "P"''' '^'"^ "^''^""^ on. or the other On put into view. On pursuing the dissection, the fascia lata is brought to view. This IS a dense layer of fibrous structure which invests the muscles of the thigh. Inferiorlv it\l attached to the tendons and Ugame^nts ajfut th^kne ! jomt; from this it ascends, forming sheaths for the dif- ferent muscles and sending in processes between them Having arrived at the upper and anterior part of the th.gh where it is connected with the anatomy of femoral hernia) It divides into three portions, the iul, pecUnlal and cribriform fascia.

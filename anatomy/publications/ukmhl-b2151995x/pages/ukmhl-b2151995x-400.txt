384 BEGIONAL AKD SURGICAL ANATOMY. Scarpa's triangle is that triangular space in the ante- rior and upper part of the thigh, which is bounded externally by the sartorius, internally by the adductor longus; its base is formed superiorly by Poupart's liga- ment, its apex below by the decussation of the sartorius and adductor longus. In this space, the most important of the stages ot the femoral artery, this vessel lies superficial, bemg covered only by the integument, superficial fascia, and fascia lata; it rests, first, on the psoas magnus which separates it from the hip-joint, next, on a number of vessels and some cellular substance which intervene between it and the insertions of the pectineus and adductor brevis, and lastly, on a portion of the adductor longus. To the inner side of the femoral artery, and on the same plane with it, lies the femoral vein, at least, near to Poupart's ligament; as we approach, however, the apex of the triangle, the femoral vein inclines to the posterior surface of the artery. The two vessels are enclosed in a funnel-shaped sheath, formed bv the fascia transversalis and the fascia ihaca, which descend from the pelvis, the former in front, the latter behind the vessels into the thigh, and are gradually lost at the lower part of Scarpa's triangle in the common sheath of the vessels ; the artery and vein are not m close contact in this sheath, being separated byathm but strong partition which passes behind from the fascia transversalis ?o the fascia iliaca. To the outer side of the femoral artery lies the anterior crural nerve; this, one of the largest of the branches of the lumbar plexus, descends frol beneath Poupart's ligament, between the psoas magnus and iliacus internus muscles, the former of which therefore, separates it from the femoral arteiT. JJ* subiects there is an interval, varying from half an inch to an inch, between the anterior crural nerve and the femoral artery, but in some few instances they are m close contact; in all cases a large branch, the internal saphenous nerve, descends from the anterior crural nerve, and soon applies itself to the outer side of the artery, and in its course down the thigh tlie vastus internus muscle is external to In'its^raid'lle stage, which extends from the apex of Scarpa's triangle to the commencement of Hunter s canal,

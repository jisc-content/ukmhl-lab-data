44 ANATOMY, The 3d metatarsal bone is a little shorter than the preceding. It articulates with four bones, viz.: The 4th metatarsal bone, slightly shorter than the former, has much the same form. It articulates with five bones, viz.: The 5th metatarsal bone projects more posteriorly than any of the others; presenting externally a tubercle, which gives attachment to the tendons of the peroneus tertius and brevis, and to the abductor minimi digiti, and is a guide to Hey's operation on the foot. It articulates with three bones, viz.: The metatarsal bones are like long bones in structure, spongy at their extremities, compact in the centre, and presenting a medullary canal. They have two points of ossification, one for the body, and one for the head, which is in a state of epiphysis for sevei-al years. The 1st meta- tarsal bone is diff"ereut from the other four, its epiphysis being at the posterior or tarsal extremity. Muscles attached: second and fourth metatarsal, the external cuneiform bone, first phalanx of third toe. external cuneiform, cuboid, third and fifth metatarsal bones, first phalanx of the fourth toe. the cuboid, fourth metatarsal bone, first phalanx of the little toe.

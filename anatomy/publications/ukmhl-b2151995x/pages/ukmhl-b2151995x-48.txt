The BONES of the lower extremity consists of the femur or thigh bone, the patella, the tibia, and the fibula, which are those of the leg; together with those of the foot, consisting of the astragalus, os calcis, os naviculare, or scaphoides, os cuboides, three ossa cuneiformia, five meta- tarsal bones ; and fourteen phalanges, constituting the toes. The femur or thigh bone is the longest and largest bone in the body ; it consists, from above downwards, of a head, neck, trochanters, body or shaft, and the condyles. The head of the femur is encrusted with cartilage ; near the centre of it is a depression for the attachment of the ligamentum teres. The 7ieck descends obhquely downwards and outwards, somewhat triangular in form, having its apex at the head of the bone, the base towards the shaft, where it is Hmited by the inter-trochanteric lines ; it is longer posteriorly, and is porous for the transmission of vessels. We next notice the trochanters, major and minor. The trochanter major projects beyond the shaft of the bone, and in the recent state is covered by a bursa; its inner surface, concave, is marked by a deep depression,

103 GROWTH OF THE TEETH. The criosta petrosa is of the character of true bone, and covers all that part of the tooth which is not invested with enamel; it contains cells and canaUculi, like ordinary bone. Its use is to fix the teeth in their sockets, and it is considered to be the seat of bony growths which some- times occur about the teeth. GROWTH OF THE TEETH. The lower jaw and alveolar processes are very early developed in the foetus, being called into exercise im- mediately after birth. About the third or fourth month of foetal life there exists in each jaw, instead of alveoli, a longitudinal groove, deep and narrow anteriorly, shal- lower and wider posteriorly, divided by bony ridges into superficial depressions, along the bottom of which run the dental vessels and nerves; after a short time processes are sent across from one edge of the groove to the other, so as to completely divide it into distinct cavities, and form the alveoli; these grow with the teeth, or even advance more rapidly, and at last nearly enclose them, becoming contracted towards their mouths; in these depressions, about the third or fourth month, soft vascular substances^ termeA pulps, begin to be formed, on which the bony part of the tooth is afterwards to be deposited ; they are not distinct so early, but become so about the fifth month, when four or five pulps are manifest; the pulps of those teeth which appear first are first formed, viz., the middle incisors, then the lateral incisors and small grinders, and last the cuspidati and large grinders, no bicuspids existing in the temporary teeth; each pulp in shape resembles the body of the tooth which is to be formed on it : it 18 soft and vascular, particularly where it is in contact with the part of the tooth deposited, so much so that it may be here deeply coloured with injection ; on the free surface of the pulp, ossification commences bv as many points as there are prominences on each tooth, there being three in the incisors, one in each of the cuspidati, four or five in the molars and two in the bicuspids when they are forniing : these diff-erent points afterwards coalesce ; the ossification proceeding from without inwards, that part which 18 first formed is the most external, and is in Jon-

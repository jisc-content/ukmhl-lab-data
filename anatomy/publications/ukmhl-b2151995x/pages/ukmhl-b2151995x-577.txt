One scruple of tobacco infused in water, is sufficient for one injection. The tobacco smoke is more ti-oublesome in its application, and less certain in its effects. Advantage should be taken of the weak state of the patient induced by these several remedies, and the taxis trjed.

To this question, perhaps the most important connected with hernia, no definite answer can be given. It depends altogether on the nature of the case, the form of hernia, the age, the constitution of the patient, and the urgency of the symptoms. Thus we can wait longer in the chronic than in the acute strangulation, in the old than in the young subject, in oblique inguinal than in direct inguinal or femoral hernia, and in eases of long standing. Larrev relates a case that proved fatal in two hours, whilst others have occurred where many days have passed over before the operation was performed, and yet with success.

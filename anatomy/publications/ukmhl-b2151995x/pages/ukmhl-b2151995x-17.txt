1 MANUAL FOR THE COLLEGE OF SUEGEONS. ANATOMY. THE BONES, LIGAMENTS, AND ARTICULATIONS, OR PASSIVE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION. The bones, ligaments, and articulations constitute the natural skeleton; the bones alone, the artificial skeleton. The Bones are the framework of the body, to which the other structures are attached, or in which they are con- tained ; and contribute largely to the formation of the articulations. They are divided into long, flat, and ir- regular. The long bones are situated in the extremities, as in the thigh and leg, the arm and forearm, where great strength and considerable motion are required ; they are expanded at each extremity for the formation of the joints,—are marked with eminences and depressions for the attach- ment of muscles and ligaments,—and are hollow in the interior for the medullary canal. Their structure is com- pact in the centre, spongy at the extremities. The flat bones are placed so as to form cavities, as in the head and pelvis; they present two surfaces, an internal concave, and an external convex; they are thicker at the edges than in the centre ; their structure consists of two compact laminae enclosing an intermediate cellular structure, termed the diploe. The irregular bones are situated where great strength and frequent motions are required, but the motion is of a compound nature, as in the spirie, the tarsus, carpus, ^c.;

REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. COVERINGS OF THE HEAD. The coverings of the brain, which serve to protect this delicate organ from injury, may be considered under the head of the external soft parts; the osseous or bony case, constituting the cranium; and the internal soft parts, comprising the cerebral membranes. The external soft parts consist of the scalp, or peri- cranium, some loose reticular tissue, and the periosteum. The scalp is covered naturally with a quantity of hair varying much in different individuals and in different situations, which assists in lessening the effect of blows on the head ; and, from hair being a bad conductor of caloric It prevents those variations in temperature which if transmitted suddenly to the brain, might be productive of injurious consequences. The structure of the scalp is composed of skin externally, and the occipito-frontal muscle and tendon more deeply seated. The cuticle is delicate and closely connected to the cutis, so that it is seldom raised in the form of vesication. The cutis is remarkably dense, and contains a number of sebaceous follicles, which are supposed to secrete an unctuous substance for the use of the hair It is frequently the seat ot encysted tumours and other morbid growths Beneath the cutis lies a layer of condensed cellular substance, containing a quantity of closely granulated fat connecting the cutis to the occipito-fiontalS^ tendon m It, the bulbs of the hair are lodged, whth external^ re^t^df^o^U tVb ^""^^'^ ^"'^ wiA dS y' 3nn V 1 ' e-^Pansion of the occipito-frontalis tendon, a dense aponcurot c structure Tff i attachment to the Vour bellies of t "rmuscf tw^'o? cra.al aponeurosis. rdt-bet tt^â€”^;

635 DISEASES OF JOINTS. to these, morbid growths frequently form in the joints, and necrosis may extend to the articular extremity of the bones. As the knee-joint is that which is most frequently dis- eased, we shall select this as the standard for the rest, only noticing in them such peculiarities as deserve distinct consideration. Inflammation of the synovial membrane or synovitis.â€” This is brought on by wounds or injuries of the articula- tion, by exposure to cold, and by metastasis from the other joints. The disease is characterised by a severe pain soon diffused over the joint, which is followed in a tew hours by a considerable swelling caused by an effusion ot serum into the articulation, which raises the patella from off the condyles of the femur, and extends some distance upwards on the anterior surface of the bone be- neath the extensor tendons, and at the same time causes a projection on either side of the ligamentum patella. The temperature of the joint is much increased, but there is no redness of the integuments for some time after the com- mencement of the inflammation. There is severe consti- tutional fever, and the patient is unable to use the ioint, aU the structures m the articulation being affected. It the disease be neglected, purulent matter soon forms Itl '^terior of the jomt, which graduaUy makes its way outwards, and is discharged by one or more openings round head of the tibia. Hectic fever now sets in, and the Z tient IS carried off unless amputation be performed. ^ The duration of the disease is extremely variable- in some cases It runs its course in two or three weeks, whils m others it assumes a more chronic form, and may aTt for months or even years.

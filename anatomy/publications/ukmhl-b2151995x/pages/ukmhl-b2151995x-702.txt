Hydatid tumour. (Vide p. 507.)â€”In its early stage it is distinguished from scrofulous tumour by its greater hardness, and from scirrhous by more softness. In its advanced stage, it is distinguished by the globular eleva- tions on its surface, by its great size and freedom from pain. Chronic mammary tumour. (Vide p. 507.) . Cartilaginous or osseous tumour is very rare, and is known by its extreme hardness, absence of much pain, and slow progess. , , ^ ^ * Scrofulous tumour occurs in early life, before twenty- five years of age, and is connected with a general scrofu- lous diathesis. The tumour is large, irregular, indistmct not painful, varies in size, increasing and diminishmg at different times, it rarely suppurates.

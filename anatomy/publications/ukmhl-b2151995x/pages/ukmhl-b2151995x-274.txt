158 ANATOMY. In the female, they are crossed by the spermatic vessels, the Fallopian tubes, and broad ligaments; they run along the sides of the vagina, and when in the coats of the bladder are in close relation with the neck of the uterus. THE ABDOMINAL AOETA AND ITS BRANCHES. The Abdominal Aorta extends from between the crura of the diaphragm at a point opposite the lowest dorsal vertebra to the lower part of the fourth lumbar vertebra, where it bifurcates into the common iliacs. The branches given oflf from it are : Two phrenic. Coeliac axis. Superior mesenteric. Two capsular. Two renal. Two spermatic. Inferior mesenteric. Four or five lumbar on each side. Sacra media. The phrenic or diaphragmatic arteries are small, and pass on each side upwards, forwards, and outwards, giving off branches which anastomose with the internal mammary and epigastric, and the lower intercostal. They give branches to the crura of the diaphragm and renal capsules; the left gives off ramuli, which anastomose with the oesophageal vessels. The coeliac axis arises close below the phrenic, is a short trunk, surrounded by the solar plexus of nerves; it inclines a Uttle downwards, and divides into three branches, viz.: Coronaria ventriculi. Hepatica. Splenica. The coronaria ventriculi, or gastrica superior, the smallest branch both in the foetus and adult, mcUnes for- wards, upwards, and to the left towards the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where it gives off an oesophageal branch, which runs through the oesophageal opening oi the diaphragm, and ramifies upon the oesophagus, anas- tomosing with the oesophageal arteries; it then takes a course along the small curvature of the stomach, supply- ing branches to its anterior and posterior surfaces, and to

26 ANATOMY. gives origin to the sartorius muscle, and Poupart's ligament anteriorly, and the tensor vaginae femoris externally; beneath this is a notch for the exit of the external cutaneous nerve, bounded inferiorly by the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, from which arise the rectus femoris muscle and the accessory ligament of the hip-joint, then a deep groove through which gUde the tendons of the iliacus internus and psoas magnus muscles ; internal to this the ilio-pectineal or pubic eminence, into which is inserted the psoas parvus tendon, and which marks the junction of the ilium and pubis ; internal to this is a long triangular portion of bone, its apex internally, its base externally, slightly excavated, termed the horizontal ramus of the pubis, from which the pectineus muscle arises, then the spine or tubercle of the pubis, a projecting pointed eminence which serves for the insertion of the outer pillar of the external abdominal ring; next the crest of the pubis, extending horizontally between this and the sym- physis pubis, and aflfording origin to the rectus and pyramidalis muscles, and forming the base of the external abdominal ring; descending from this is the angle of the pubis, formed between the crest and symphysis pubis, in front of which passes the internal pillar of the ring; descending vertically is the symphysis pubis, where the two ossa innominata are joined by cai'tilage, then the edge of the descending ramus of the pubis and ascending of the ischium affording attachment to the triangular ligament, the perineal fascia, the crura penis, erector penis muscle, &c.; then the tuberosity of the ischium, giving attachment to the biceps, semitendinosus and semimem- branosus muscles inferiorly, the quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus posteriorly, together with the great sacro-sciatic ligament; superior and posterior to this is the lesser sciatic notch, a smooth depression, prolonged internally, between the tuberosity and spine of the ischium, through which passes out the tendon of the obturator internus muscle, by which it is sometimes grooved ; above this is the spine of the ischium, a sharp bony prominence for the insertion of the lesser sacro- Bciatic ligament and the origins of the superior gemellus muscle externally, the coccygeus muscle ijiternally ; next is the great ischiatic or sciatic notch completed posteriorly

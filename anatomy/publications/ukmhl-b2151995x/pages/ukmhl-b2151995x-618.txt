SCRGERIt. 602 ping of the bones, or effusion of blood, lymph, or serum into the cellular tissue; shortening produced at the time of the accident, or soon after, by the retraction of the lower part of the limb, by the spasmodic contraction of the muscles; crepitus, or a grating sound, when the ends of the fractured bones are moved one against the other; complete or partial loss of power; a certain degree of pain, aggravated by motion; a capability on the part ot the surgeon to remove the deformity by moderate exten- sion, on relaxing which the deformity is reproduced. If then we select a particular bone, let us say the shaft oi the femur as an example for the rest, we shall find aU the preceding symptoms. The deformity caused by the over- lapping or projection of the bones renders fractures, especially of the superficial bones, at once evident either to the eye, or to the finger passed along m the direction of the bone, supposed to be fractured. The melling of the limb seldom sets in immediately after the occurrence of the accident, unless when a large artery lias been rup- tured either by the ends of the bone or by the violence, in which case the blood is injected into the ceUular tissue amongst the muscles, and sometimes immediately beneath the integuments; in this latter case the skin presents a dark livid appearance, and, when vesications form on the surface, as occasionally happens in simple fracture, is not nnfrequently mistalcen for mortification. The diagnosis, however, is simple, as the livid colour comes on immedi- ately after the injury, the parts retain their temperature and sensibility, and the vesications are tense, circular m shape, and filled with a straw-coloured, transparent fluid, in which they diifer from the vesications of gangrene. The extent of the shortening of the hmb is variable de- pending on the nature of the fracture and the power of the muscles attached to the bone. In some c^/^^there may be no shortening, as m cases of transverse fracture, unat- tended with displacement of the fractured extremities. In no case of fracture, excepting that of the olecranon and neck of the scapula, have we lengthening of the extremity. â€¢ In endeavouring to ascertain whether the juj^^-ed li^^b is shorter or not than the other, we should careful that the patient Ues perfectly straight, as otherwise the i mb mav appear to be shorter when such is not the case: this

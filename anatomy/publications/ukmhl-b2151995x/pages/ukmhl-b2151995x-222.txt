206 ANATOMY. The Laxator tympani arises from— the spinous process of sphenoid bone; and is inserted into— the processus gracilis of the malleus. The Laxator tympani minor has its origin from— the bony circumference of the membrana tympani; and is inserted into— the manubrium of the malleus, near the short process. The Stapedius arises from— the tube of the pyramid; and is inserted into— the neck of the stapes. The Eustachian tube is partly formed of bone and parUy of cartilage, the cartUaginous porUon thirds of it. It is narrowest about the niiddie tnira, broadest afits anterior part. Its f e"m f e - is forwards inwards, and a httle downwards. It opens oUos^rthe posterior part of the inferior spongy bone. S bony porSn is separated from the tensor tympanx muscle by a thin bony partition, called processus colch- Zr^lrZ. The cartVge does not com^^^^^^^^^^^ the tube; it is deficient at the mfenor exteinal part, wmcn is filled ut) bv a fibrous substance. , ^^eZ^/rinth consists of the vestibule, cochlea and S o Sis, w Eelicate membrane, between Zcb the nerve is the K5»or Cotunm, or »,«. My rinthi. Its boundaries are: Anteriorly, the cochlea. Posteriorly, the semicircular canals. Internally, th'^ lamina cribrosa, for the portio mol is ErteLli}, the osseous plate forming tbe pronio.^ory. Superiorly' the bone, containing the aqueduct of Fallopius. The openings into it in the dry bone are: the fenestra

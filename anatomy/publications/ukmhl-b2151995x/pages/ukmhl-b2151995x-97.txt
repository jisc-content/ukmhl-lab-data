I EADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATIONS. and is implanted inferiorly and externally into the radius immediately below its tubercle, and separates the supinator brevis and flexor subUmis muscle: it is quite distinct from the interosseous membrane; its principal use is to prevent too great supination of the fore-arm : in pronation it is relaxed. The radius and ulna are united in the centre of the for e-arm by a strong fibrous structure, termed the inter- osseous membrane or ligament, attached externally to the inner edge of the radius; it descends obliquely from this, and is implanted into the opposite edge of the ulna; it is deficient above to a considerable extent, to give room for the origins of some of the flexor and extensor muscles, the insertion of the biceps tendon, and the transmission of the posterior interosseous artery, and also below for the passage of one of the terminating branches of the anterior interosseous artery and nerve ; in its centre it presents numerous foramina for the passage of vessels and nerves ; its anterior surface is covered by the flexor pro- fundus, flexor longus poUicis, and pronator quadratus muscles, and the interosseous artery and nerve ; its posterior surface is covered by the supinator brevis, extensores pollicis and indicator: besides giving origin to these mus- cles, it serves to connect the radius and ulna. The inferior radio-ulnar articulation is formed between the lower extremities of the radius and ulna, where they are in contact: for this purpose the ulna presents a round convex surface, oblong, incrusted with cartilage, which is received into a corresponding concave surface on the radius, an arrangement precisely the reverse of that on the superior extremities of the bones. One ligament only, lined by synovial membrane, belongs to this articulation, the sacciform ligament; this envelops the articular surface of the ulna, to the edges of which as well as to those of the articular surface of the radius, it is attached ; it is exceedingly thin, lax, and weak, and is lined internally by a synovial membrane, which contains much synovia; a triangular fibro-cartilage is connected with this articulation, but more properly belongs to the wrist-joint. This articulation belongs to the%lass of Lateral Gmglymus. 4ยง

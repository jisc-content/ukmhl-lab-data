PELVIC VISCERA. 263 is surrounded by the prostate gland, and is conical in shape. A hne drawn through the centre or axis of the bladder, and extended at either end, would touch the extremity of the coccyx inferiorly, and pass out anteriorly ascending between the umbilicus and pubes. The bladder IS surrounded, except posteriorly, by a quantity of loose cellular tissue, which allows it, when distended, to ascend out of the pelvic cavity. The ligaments of the bladder are divided into the false and true The/a/se are folds of peritoneum, and are five in number, namely, two lateral, two posterior, and one superior. The lateral false ligaments are formed by the reflexions of the peritoneum, from the bladder to the side 01 the pelvis; each contains the vas deferens in the male Ihe posterior false ligaments are formed by the oeri- toneum passing from the bladder on the rectum ■ thev are concave upwards and forwards, and contain the ureter and degenerated umbilical artery on each side.

22 ANATOMY. The middle costo-transverse ligament is composed of a few irregular fibres connecting the anterior surface of the transverse process to the neck of the rib, and is seen by forcibly separating the bones. The first, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, articulating by their heads with a single vertebra, have no interarticular fibro- cartilage; and there is no anterior costo-transverse liga- ment connected with the first and twelfth ribs. The anterior extremities of the ribs are connected to the costal cartilages by means of a synchondrosis articulation, and by the tendinous expansions derived from the different muscles in the neighboui'hood, which also serve to connect the cartilages of the ribs with the sternum; these, in ad- dition, with the exception of the first costal cartilage, possess a synovial membrane, and enjoy a good deal of motion: they form an arthrodial articulation. The last true rib is connected to the xiphoid cartilage by the costo- xiphoid ligament. The structure of the ribs is compact externally, spongy internally; that of the sternum princi- pally spongy, with a thin layer of compact tissue externally and internally. The structure of the cartilages resembles that of cartilage in other situations; they possess great elasticity, and are frequently ossified in the old subject. The ribs have three points of ossification, one for the head, a second for the tubercle, and the third for the body. The Muscles attached to the ribs on each side are: Pectoralis major. minor. Suhclavius. Scaleni. Latissimus dorsi. Serratus magnm. Serratus superior posticus. inferior Sacro-lumbalis. Longissimus dorsi. Levatores costarum. Intercostales. Sterno-costalis. Diaphragma. Obliqmis ex tenuis abdominis. internus Transversalis T , , Reclns \abdomtnis. Quadraltts lumborum.

OBLiaUE INGUINAL HERNIA. 521 The conjoined tendons lie behind and to the outside of the preceding: they are the united tendons of the internal obhque and tranversahs muscles, which here pass in front of the rectus muscle, to be inserted into] the upper part of the symphysis and crest of the pubes; the external margin of the conjoined tendons is prolonged beyond the outer edge of the rectus muscle; it here is inferiorly implanted mto the hnea innominata, where it is continuous with Crimbernat's ligament. Above this the transversalis fascia IS implanted into it; here, indeed, the two structures trequently appear to be continuous one with the other. from the great strength and transverse extent of the conjoined tendons, and their position immediately behind tbe external abdominal ring, they contribute much to the security of the abdomen in this situation, and thus prevent tbe formation of direct inguinal hernia Inguinal or spermatic canal. This is an oblique canal or passage between the abdominal muscles, which trans- mits the spermatic cord in the male, the round ligament in named the abdominal rings: one of which, the external, we have already described; the other, the internal, is situ^tld about midway between the symphysis pubis and the spine of the Ilium, and IS as yet concealed from view. Divide he tendon of the external oblique from the externd abdominal ring, upwards and outwards, towards the Uium, parallel to and a little above Foumart s ligament he greater part of the inguinal canal is now fxposed hefe a'fla^S spermatic cord. This latter prLenS here a flattened appearance, having its,component parts partially spread out, so as not to suffer from the action of the abdominal muscles. °* f.?^", '/T'"''^ f*" 'P^'''^''ti<^ ^o-nal commences at the in but somewhat nearer the former abnnf ./™P"y^^® P^^ois, an inch above Poupart's ^3^/ ? quarters of descends forwards^and fcds ^eir '^f, muscles, and terminates at ^ external n']", " f ^-^"^ Its length is about one inch and atS:1f t'^iT^

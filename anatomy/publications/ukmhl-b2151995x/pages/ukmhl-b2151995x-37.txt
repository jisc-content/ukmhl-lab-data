21 LIGAMENTS OF THOKAX. LIGAMENTS AND AKTICULATIONS OF THE THORAX. The heads of the ribs, excepting the first, eleventh, and twelfth, presenting two convex articulating surfaces, are received into and between the articulating surfaces on the bodies of tivo of the dorsal vertebrce, and are connected to them by the anterior costo-vertebral or stellated ligament, the inter-artieular ligament, and a double synovial mem- brane. The tubercles are directly connected to the trans- verse process of the inferior of the two vertebrae with which the head of each rib is articulated, hy the posterior and the middle costo-transverse ligaments, and a synovial capsule lined by synovial membrane; and their necks are con- nected with the transverse processes of the vertebrae by the inferior costo-transverse ligament. â€¢ The anterior costo-vertebral or stellated ligament is situated in the interior of the thorax; it arises from the anterior surface of the head of the rib, from which it radiates to be attached to the bodies of the vertebrse above and below, and to the intervertebral substance in the centre. The inter-articular ligament ov fihro-cartilage is situated in the interior of the joint and stretches from the ridge, already described, on the head of the rib, to the interver- tebral substance, with which it is continuous ; it separates the synovial membrane of this articulation into two distinct sacs. The posterior costo-transverse ligament arises from the extremity of the transverse process of the vertebra, passes almost transversely outwards to be inserted into the non- articular portion of the tubercle of the rib; it is a short and strong ligament. The anterior or costo-transverse ligament arises, narrow and pointed, from the inferior edge of the transverse 'pro- cess of the vertebra above, descends obliquely inwards, expands, and is inserted into the upper edge of the neck of the rib beloiv, near its connection with the body of the vertebra: this ligament forms the external boundary of a triangular space through which the posterior branches of the intercostal artery and nerve pass: the triangle is completed iiiternally by the body of the vertebra, and superiorly by the transverse process which forms its base.

THE ANKLE-JOINT. 55 wards to be inserted into the inner part of the astragakis, where they form a fibrous canal, through which the tendon of the flexor pollieis runs, and into the sustenta- culum of the OS calcis ; the posterior fibres are inserted also into the astragalus and os calcis; this ligament is broad, strong, and expanded, like internal lateral ligaments in general, in order to support the weight of the body- thrown obliquely on it, in consequence of the obliquity of the superior articular surface of the astragalus. The external lateral ligaments are three in number, the anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior ligament arises from the anterior edge of the external malleolus, passes almost horizontally forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the rough surface on the upper and outer part of the neck of the astragalus. The middle external lateral ligament arises from near the apex of the external malleohis, passes downwards, backwards, and inwards, and is inserted into a tubercle on the outer surface of the os calcis: it has also received the name of perpendicular ligament; the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis wind round its outer surface. The posterior external lateral, or posterior peroneo- tarsal ligament, arises from the inner surface of the external malleolus, passes horizontally backwards and inwards, and is inserted into the rough surface ou the posterior part of the astragalus. The anterior tibio-tarsal ligament arises from the ante- rior surface of the tibia, and is implanted into the upper part of the neck of the astragalus ; it is a weak, indistinct ligament; the synovial sheath investing the extensor ten- dons frequently communicates with the ankle-joint through a deficiency in this ligament. The posterior tibio-tarsal ligament is placed at the posterior part of the joint, and is still more indistinct. The posterior tibio-Jibular ligament. This ligament is situated at the posterior part of the ankle-joint; it stretches from the outer surface of the internal malleolus trans- versely across, to be implanted into the inner surface of the external malleolus ; it is sometimes but badly marked ; this hgament might be called the cotyloid ligament of the ankle-joint; its use is to deepen the articular cavity without interfering with the motion of the joint; its

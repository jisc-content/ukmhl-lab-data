619 TREATMENT OF FRACTURES. weight is thrown on the radius, in consequence of its articulation with the carpal bones; the result is a frac- ture of the radius, in its lower expanded portion, from half an inch to an inch and a half above the styloid process. The accident is known by the history of the case; a swelling in front, produced by effusion into the sheaths of the tendons; a less extensive swelling at the dorsum of the wrist; a depression corresponding to the seat of the fracture, and caused by the pronator quadratus drawing in the fractured portion towards the ulna; and by the position of the hand, which is thrown backwards. Crepitus is with difficulty distinguished in this fracture from the lower extremity of the radius being fixed by ligaments: it is best ascertained by grasping the bone firmly above and below the seat of the fracture, and then moving the bones one on the other. Rotation of the hand IS not sufficient for this purpose, as, from the broad sur- faces by which the ends of the bones are in apposition, the whole radius will move as freely as when not broken. The bones having been placed in apposition by extension and counter-extension, a wetted roUer is to be applied loosely round the forearm, a long narrow compress is to be now placed on the anterior, and another on the poste- rior surface of the forearm, and then compressed into the interosseous spaces, by means of splints extending along the front and back of the forearm, and reaching from the elbow to the palm of the hand, and made fast by a few turns of the bandage. The forearm is to be supported in a 8 ing, the ulna supporting the weight of the extremity, and the hand allowed to hang. The great object in treat- ing this fracture IS to prevent the fractured portions of the radius from being drawn inwards by the pronator quad- ratus, thus obliterating the interosseous space. The natient seldom recovers the use of the hand before three or even six months, as the inflammation consequent on the fracture causes much swelling which is slowly removed Fractures of the melarcarpal bones take place bv direct violence; they are treated by placing a bÂ«ll wifW the clenched hand, and then applyfn ^ Sagt^^ "'^^^^ Fractures of the phalanges of the fingers arc treated bv rolling the parts in a tape, or narrow calico bandage and then applying a pasteboard splint. ^nuage, ana

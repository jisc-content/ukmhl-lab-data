The teeth of a child, that is, the first set m each jaw, are four incisors, two cuspidati or canini, and four molares. In each jaw of the adult there are four tnmor*, two cuspidati or canmi, four bicuspidaii^ ^v, molares. Ihe posterior molares, which protrude often late in life, ha^^ been named denies sapienti^. The first, or an enor mo^ lares, are the earliest of the permanent teeth which show themselves above the gums. , , i i v^e The soft parts of the mouth are, the cheeks and l.ps, the gums, the soft palate and uvula, the tongue, the hmng membrane, and salivary glands. . The cheeks and lips are formed by common integumen and muscle, and are studded with glands, named buccal and labial, which secrete fluid very like saliva. The soft palate is the loose fleshy curtain which hangs down from the palate bones, forming a partition between ?he mouth and the pharynx, and consists of five muscles enclosed in a mucous membrane. There is a small fle.hy substance projecting from its centre, caUed the from whih tw?folds of membrane diverge forming the antenor iTposterior arehes of the palate. The ormer passes to the side of the tongue, the latter to the pharynx. In the ;?rant5ar space between them is a glandular body, named the amygdala or tonsil. wlnrb Ihe tonsils consist of an ^gS^'^g^^^^'^'^ Â°J f J^J^;'^1,^^^^^ secrete a thick mucus.

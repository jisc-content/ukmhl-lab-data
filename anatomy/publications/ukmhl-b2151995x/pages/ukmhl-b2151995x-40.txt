24 ANATOMY. upwards, and is convex and irregular; we observe on it, in the mesial line, four or five eminences, more or less united, which correspond with the spinous processes of the vertebrse: at their inferior extremity is a triangular aperture in which the spinal canal terminates, bounded laterally by two tubercles, which give attachment to the sacro-sciatic ligaments; beneath them is a groove which forms, with the OS coccygis, a foramen for the transmission of the last sacral nerve; on each side of the spinal eminences is a gi'oove continuous with the vertebral gutters above, and exhibiting four or five posterior sacral foramina, for trans- mitting the posterior sacral nerves, much smaller than the anterior, and diminishing in size from above downwardsâ€” exiernally to these are rough lines, analogous to transverse processes, for the attachment of ligaments; the lateral edges of the sacrum are wide above, narrow and thin inferiorly; they are marked superiorly by a rough articular surface, resembling somewhat the human ear with the concavity turned backwards, for connection with the os innominatum : beneath this it gives attachment to the sacro-sciatic ligaments, and forms part of the great sciatic notch. The sacrum belongs to the class of irregular bones, and is composed almost altogether of spongy structure. The OS coccygis is an assemblage of three or four, small irregular bones, decreasing in size from above doiunwards, and held together by ligaments; they are consolidated, not only together, but with the sacrum, in the male subject at the age of thirty-five or forty, bat in the female not till forty-five or fifty. They are chiefly composed of spongy tissue. The ossa innominata are two irregularly-shaped bones situated one on each side of the pelvis; each consists of three parts, the ilium, ischium, and pubis, firmly united in the adult, but separated in the young subject: these three bones unite together in the acetabulum, the ischium forming rather more than two fifths, the ilium rather less than two fifths, and the pubis one fifth. Of the three parts, the ilium is the largest, and forms the superior expanded part of the os innominatum ; tlic ischium is next in size, and forms the posterior inferior part; whilst the pubis is the smallest, and occupies the anterior part of the bone. On the outer surface of the os innominatum the

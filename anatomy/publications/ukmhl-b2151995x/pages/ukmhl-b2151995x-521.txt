In this, the integuments afd fasc a are cut through, and the knife passes between the terno-hyoTd and thyroid muscles of each side; separate these muscles, and by tearing hrough some cellular tissue, the trachea will be Exposed having in front of it the thyroid plexus of veins. These shoS be avoided as they are large, and will, if wounded, pour oufa large quantity of blood, during the flow of which the trachea cannot be opened, as immediate suffocation of the patient would be the result, from the blood being sucked into the trachea The trachea IS now to be opened, whilst the patient makes an effort perpendicularly If the opening be necessary for some time a Sliver trachea-tube must be introduced, and worn by the paSe^t JvniH TH''".5""^r'"r^ °P^'-''"°" oftracheotomv, has to avoid the thyroid gland above, the left vena innominata below and any irregular distribution of the arteries from the arch of 2; aorta that may exist; of these the most frequently met with il ' middle thyroid artery, which ascends from the arch of the n -l m front of the trachea to the thyroid gland.

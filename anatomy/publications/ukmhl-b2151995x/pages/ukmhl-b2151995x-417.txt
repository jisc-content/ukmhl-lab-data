ANTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY. 401 anterior tibial artery lies deep between the tibialis anticus and the extensor longus digitorum; in the middle third also, it lies deep between the tibialis anticus and the extensor polhcis, but in the lower third becomes more superficial, being thrown forwards by the lower extremity of the tibia on which it rests, and lies between the tendons of the extensor longus and the extensor pollicis, which do not conceal it like the fleshy fibres of the muscles; it is here covered by the skin and fascia only. As the anterior tibial artery crosses in front of the ankle-joint, it is but little removed from the synovial membrane of the articula- tion ; it is here covered by the bursa, which envelops the extensor tendons, and which not unfrequently commu- nicates with the joint. On the dorsum of the foot the anterior tibial artery is superficial, being covered only by the integuments, and crossed about the middle of the tarsus by the internal tendon of tiie extensor digitorum brevis; it here runs over the astragalus, navicular and internal cuneiform bones. The anterior tibial artery is accompanied by two vense comites, one on each side, and by the anterior tibial nerve, a branch from the external pophteal or peroneal nerve. This nerve, the smaller division of the sciatic nerve, we have already traced through the popliteal space; from this it winds around the neck of the fibula, gives off several branches to the peroneal muscles, and divides into its two terminating branches, the anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous nerve Ihe anterior tibial nerve runs downwards and inwards joins the artery of the same name a little above the middle ot the leg, and accompanies it, first lying to its outer and then crossing to its inner side, to the dorsum of the foot Here the nerve divides into two terminating branches, the internal of which is lost in the extensor brevis the first interosseous muscle, and the integuments on the opposed surfaces of the great and second toes; the external branch IS ost in the extensor brevis and articulations of the toot. The musculo-cutaneous nerve descends between the extensor communis and peroneus longus muscle ne, forates the fascia of the le,^ at the junctfon o^th miS and niferior th.rds, oecomes superficial, descends to the dorsum of the foot, and terminates in the inte-rnments of the toes, anastomosing on each side with the inle S and

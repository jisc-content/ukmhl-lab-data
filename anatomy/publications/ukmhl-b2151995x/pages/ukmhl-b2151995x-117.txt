THE TEETH. 1Q| teeth, heuce they are sometimes called the eye-teetli; the free extremity corresponds with the interval between the lateral incisors and the first bicuspid of the lower jaw. The bicuspidati or small molars are placed two on each side, between the preceding and the molares; their body long from before backwards, compressed laterally, terminates in two tubercles, separated by a depression • the anterior of these is the larger and more projecting,' and nearly conceals the other; as it approaches the fang It becomes smaller, and has its eiiamel terminating equally all round; the fang is broad and compressed, deeply grooved laterally, and terminates sometimes, and more frequently in the upper jaw, in a double fang. Those of the upper jaw are broader and flatter than those of the lower ; their fangs contain a double cavity, even when a single one exists, one towards each margin. These teeth are more frequently wanting than any other, except the dentes sapientise. The molares or grinders are three on each side • the hrst and second resemble one another, the third differs trom these: they possess the greatest number of points or prominences on their body, and the greatest number of tangs. Iheir body or crown is commonly marked by five prominences, (although it sometimes possesses but four or even three,) three external and two internal • the ex- ternal of these are the most projecting and least on a line with the surface of the tooth; between these prominences there is an irregularly depressed surface; the body con- tracts but httle towards the neck, and terminates by di- viding into two, three, four, or five fangs, most frequently three, two being external and one internal, all of which possess an opening at their summit, leading into the cavity of the tooth; the enamel covers more of the free ha„ their lateral surfaces.

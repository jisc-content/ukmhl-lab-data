ARTERIA FEMORALIS. 385 the femoral artery is more deeply situated, being covered by the integuments, superficial fascia, fascia lata, and the sartorius ; the femoral vein hes here posterior, but closely connected to it, and the saphenous nerve lies to its outer side, also in close contact with it. In its third stage the femoral artery lies in a tendinous canal, called after the celebrated John Hunter, who re- commended the femoral artery to be tied here for the cure of popliteal aneurism. This canal is triangular in shape, the apex is turned backwards towards the linea aspera, and is formed by the junction of the inner and outer walls of the canal; the base IS directed forwards, and is formed by a tendinous aponeurosis, which passes oS from the vastus internus to the adductor muscles ; its inner wall is formed by the adductor magnus and longus; its outer m all by the vastus internus. Ihe tendinous aponeurosis, which forms the base or root of Hunter's canal, varies much as to strength and extent, in some being strong and well marked, in T^JluT T7 f «»P<^rioriy it commences gradually, and frequently reaches close to the apex of Scarpa s triangle; but inferiorly terminates at the j unction of the middle and inferior thirds of the thigh, in a weU- defined semilunar edge, beneath which the internal saphe- nous nerve and a small artery pass. The femoral artery IS here a so covered by the sartorius. It lies within the canal with the internal saphenous nerve and the femoral vem, the former being in front, the latter behind the artery, but in close contact with it.

416 PHYSIOLOGY. urine in the disease called diabetes mellitus. Milk sugar is composed of 24 carbon, 24 hydrogen, and 24 oxygen. Diabetic sugar contains, carbon 24, hydrogen 28, oxygen 28. Diabetic sugar resembles grape sugar in its leading properties, and is distinguished from ordinary cane sugar by being much less soluble in water, by tasting much less sweet, by crystallising with difficulty, and not being blackened by sulphuric acid. Butter is found to contain four fatty acids, called butyric, capric, caproic, and caprylic. Of these, the first is the most important, and contains— Carbon, 8; Hydrogen, 7; Oxygen, 3; Water, 1. Cholesterine (bile-fat) is the peculiar fatty substance found in the bile in small quantities, and forming one of the principal constituents of gall stones. It was at one time supposed to contain nitrogen. Its formula is— Carbon, 36; Hydrogen, 32 ; Oxygen, 1. To describe the chemical nature of the salts existing in the body, would be trenching too much on chemistry, and would exceed the limits afforded by this work. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE PRINCIPAL SECRETIONS AND EXCRETIONS. Blood, when first drawn from an animal, appears to be a homogeneous, opaque, red-coloured fiuid, but when allowed to rest for a short time, separates into a firm, elastic, opaque red mass, called the clot or crassamentum, and a yellowish semi-transparent fluid, called the serum. Tbe crassamentum is formed by the red and many of the white corpuscles of the blood being enclosed in a remarkably compact but fine network, foi-med by the spontaneously coagulating fibrine, whilst the serum contains the remaining ingredients of the blood. The blood, whilst in the vessels, is considered as composed of corpuscles and plasma, whilst after coagulation it contains the clot (which is formed by the corpuscles, plus the fibrine,) and the serum, (which is the plasma, minus the fibrine.) The composition of the blood is:

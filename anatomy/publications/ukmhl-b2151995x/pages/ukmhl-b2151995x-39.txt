The pelvis is a large bony cavity, situated at the inferior part of the trunk, supporting the spine, resting on the lower extremities, and containing the pelvic viscera; it is formed by four bones, the sacrum, two ossa innominata, and the os coccygis. The sacrum is situated at the posterior part of the pelvis, of a triangular or wedge shape, with the base* directed upwards and the apex downwards; it is firmly impacted between the ossa innominata, and presents a base, an apex, an anterior and & posterior surface, and two lateral edges. The base of the sacrum is turned upwards and slightly forwards, and presents its greatest extent in the transverse direction ; it projects anteriorly, where it forms the pi'o- montory of the sacrum ; behind this is the upper aperture of the sacral canal of a triangular shape, giving lodo-ment to the termination of the cauda equina. The anterior su7face of the sacrum looks also downwards, and presents in the centre four or five transverse ridges, indicating the division of the difi'erent pieces (termed false vertebrce), of which the sacrum is composed in infancy; on each side of tbese are the anterior sacral foramina, for transmittino- the anterior sacral nerves, four or five in number, much larger than the posterior, and diminishing in size from above downwards; they are separated by bony surfaces which give attachment to the pyriformis muscle- the posterior surface of the sacrum is turned considerably

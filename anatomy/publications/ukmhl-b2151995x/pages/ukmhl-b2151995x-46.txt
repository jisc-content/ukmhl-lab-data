30 ANATOMY. behind by fibrous structures, termed its anterior and pos- terior ligaments ; they are not important. The ossa innominata are further connected by the sub- pubic ligament, and the triangular ligament oi the urethra; which parts will be more properly described, when consi- dering the genito-urinary organs. The obturator foramen is neaiiy closed up by the obturator ligament; it is an exceedingly thin, delicate ligament, deficient superiorly, to allow of the passage of the obturator vessels and nerves : it is covered internally and externally by the obturator internus and externus muscles respectively. The pelvis, thus formed, is divided into the false and true by the linea ilio-pectinea : the expanded portion above that line is the false pelvis, the deep contracted portion below this line is the true pelvis. The superior aperture of the true pelvis is much smaller than that of the false ; it is triangular in the male, its base posteriorly, oval in the female, with its long axis directed transversely; it is directed downwards and backwards, and a line prolonged downwards through its centre will touch the lower third of the sacrum. The inferior aperture of the pelvis is of a diamond shape, long from before backwards, expanded in its centre between the tuberosities of the ischia: pointed posteriorly at the extremity of the os coccygis, and ante- riorly at the sub-pubic angle, formed by the meeting of the OS pubis of each side; it is bounded^jos<m'o?*/y by the OS coccygis; laterally by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, the tuberosities of the ischia in the centre, and the rami of the ischium and pubis in front; and anteriorly by the sub- pubic ligament filling up the angle of the pubis; its axis is downwards and a little forwards : a line drawn upwards through its centre will touch the sacro-vertebral angle. In the foetus the pelvis is remarkably small, and con- sists of several bones, the sacrum being then divided into four or five pieces, and the os innominatum into the ischium, ilium, and pubis, all of which become consolidated before the age of puberty; they are nearly straight, so tliat the cavity of the pelvis scarcely exists, and present epiphyses at the crest of the ilium and the tuberosity of the ischium; the bladder, rectum, and small intestines then chiefly occupy the abdominal cavity: its aperture is more directly forwards; the change which takes place in

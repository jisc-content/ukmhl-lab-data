102 ANATOMY. crown possesses but four tubercles in the lower jaw; its fangs are as the preceding, three in the upper, two in the lower jaw ; the external fangs of both teeth are nearly vertical, whilst the internal, stronger, diverges from them internally, so as to afford considerable resistance to the extraction of the tooth, and frequently to cause a fracture of the alveoli. The third molar tooth is the smallest and most irregular; its crown possesses three or four tuber- cles ; it possesses one, two, or three fangs, most frequently one in the lower jaw ; they are shorter than those of the preceding, and do not diverge to the same extent: they are directed forwards, so as to support the second molar tooth : this tooth in the upper jaw is smaller than that of the lower, hence the two rows of teeth meet exactly at the posterior extremity. The last molar teeth have received the name of denies sapientice, from their not appearing till the age of about twenty-one ; they decay shortly after their appearance and are often wanting. Structure.â€”The teeth are composed of three substances, the enamel, the ivory of the tooth now named dentine, and the crusta petrosa. The enamel is that white substance which covers the teeth where they are exposed, and is the hardest structure in the human body, producing sparks with steel: it is of a milk white colour, and is capable of a high degree of polish; it appears to be one uniform mass, but is com- posed of fibres which are placed perpendicularly, some to the centre, and some to the surface of the bony portion, in order that they may better resist the effects of friction, it is thickest where most exposed : the enamel is not vas- cular, and is perhaps the least organised structure in the living body; its chemical composition is the same as that of the bony portion, except that it contains more phosphate and fluate of lime and only a trace of animal matter. The detitine forms the bulk of the teeth ; is of great hardness; and is now described to be tubular in structure : for when carefully examined by the aid of the microscope, it exhibits an immense number of minute tubes, running through a compact substance, and generally taking an oblique, sometimes horizontal, and even perpendicular direction, from the interior of the tooth towards its surface. They are filled with earthy matter.

262 ANATOMY, of the two common iliac veins opposite the fourth lumbar vertebra: it ascends rather on the right side of the spme, and after grooving the under surface of the liver, perforates the cordiform tendon of the diaphragm, and opens into the right auricle of the heart. In its course upwards it receives the foUowing branches,â€”part of the lumbar y^vus, right and left renal, right spermatic, both capsular some- times, phrenic or diaphragmatic, and vencB cavts hepatica. The sacra media sometimes opens into it. PELVIC VISCERA AND GENITAL OB.GANS. The organs or viscera contained within the pelvis are, in the male, the urinary bladder, the rectum, and part ot the genital apparatus ; in the female, the unnary bladder, rectum, and the uterus, with its appendages The bladder, or vesica urinaria, is situated in the ante- rior, inferior part of the pelvis, immediately belund the pubes when contracted, but, when distended, rises above the pubes, behind the recti muscles. It is pyramidal in shape ; its apex, or superior fundus, is turned ^P^^r J ^J^J forwai'ds, lies behind the recti muscles, and has attached toTt the urachus; the base, or inferior fundus is turned downwards and backwards, and rests on the inferior th^rd of The rectum, partially separated from it m the male by he prostate gland; vesiculee seminales, and vasa deferent a: E a riangular space exists, bounded on each side by the vas deferent and vesicula seminalis ; its apex is in front, Tthe prostate gland, and its base is for-d postenorl^^^ bv the cul-de-sac of the peritoneum: through this tri aLular space the bladder is sometimes tapped from the tectum' V^^body of the bladder lies between the supenor and'^erior fundus, it is rounded and ^^gMy compressed from before backwards : its anterior siirface eon esponds to the posterior surface of the pubis and ^ecti m"sc e^^^ distended; its posterior surface is covered by peritoneum. andTs in contac^t with the small intestines, -I'jeh separate i^from the rectum; its lateral surfaces are related to the inner kyer of the pelvic fascia, the levator am muscles and obturator vessels and nerves; along them ascend the ximbilical arteries, and descend the vasa deferentia and Tete s The cei^i. or neck of the bladder is its ante- rior inferior portion, where the urethra commences; it

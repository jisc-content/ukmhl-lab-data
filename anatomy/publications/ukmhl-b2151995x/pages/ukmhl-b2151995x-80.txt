ANATOMY. G4 from it by a slight projection of tlie bone, is the trochlea, a large articular surface, concave from side to side, convex from before backwards, bounded in front and behind by the anterior and posterior humeral fossae, and articulated with the great sigmoid cavity of the ulna; this is bounded internally by a prominent ridge of bone which descends considerably below the rest of the humerus, and is termed the epitrochlea; internal to this is a rough depression, and most internally the internal condyle, a sharp triangular process of bone, directed backwards and inwards, and placed on a plane posterior and superior to the external, and much more projecting than the other; it gives attach- ment to the internal lateral ligament, and most of the flexor and pronator muscles; the lower extremity of the bone is turned forwards and inwards, so that the fore-arm may be thrown across the chest in flexion of the elbow- joint. The humerus is developed by several points of ossification, at birth the shaft is ossified, and the extremities are entirely cartilaginous, but subsequently ossification proceeds from several points, one each for the head, tuberosities, the condyles, the trochlea, and the lesser head. It is perfectly ossified at about twenty years of age. It articulates with three bones, the scapula, the radius, and ulna. Muscles attached to the Humerus : {Supra-spinatus. Infra spinatus.

DISEASES OF THE EYE. 485 nience from the irregularity of the pupih Where a number of ulcers form on the cornea, vision may be wholly destroyed by the opacity that results from the healing process, and which is never afterwards removed The same results may follow from a single ulcer, and particularly where the iris has been protruded. 2. Thickening of the conjunctiva covering the cornea. This is more frequently the result of chronic than of acute conjunctivitis. In this, red vessels pass along the thick- ened conjunctiva over the cornea, and, inosculating, form an opaque vascular membrane, destroying the transpa- rency of the cornea. The division of the vessels at a short distance from the edge of the cornea, or, what is preferable, a removal of a portion of them, followed by the appUcation of blisters in the neighbourhood of the disease, and the use of astringent lotions or solutions of the nitrate of silver, will sometimes succeed m restoring vision. 3. Effusion of ly^nph between the layers of the cornea-leucoma, albugo.—'VhiB is caused by an exten- sion of the inflammation to the substance of the cornea. «nnl -^^^ appearance of white opaque spots, their eflfect on vision depends on their extent and their relation to the centre of the eyes. This appearance 18 named leucoma or albugo. Some authors confine the term albugo to the eff-usion of lymph on the surface of the cornea The treatment of this affection consists in stimu- lating the absorbents to the removal of the effused lymph 4.

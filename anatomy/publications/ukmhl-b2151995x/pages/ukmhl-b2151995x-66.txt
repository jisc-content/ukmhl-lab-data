50 ANATOMY, The external lateral ligament is a round fibrous chord ; it arises superiorly from an eminence on the external condyle of the femur, immediately above the depression for the popliteus tendon, passes downwards, a little back- wards and outwards, and is inserted into the upper extremity or head of the fibula, between the tendinous insertions of the biceps flexor cruris ; there is sometimes a second external lateral ligament, situated posterior to the first; it is much smaller, arises from the fibula, passes upwards, and is inserted either into the external semi- lunar cartilage or into the external condyle of the femur; on its outer surface the external lateral ligament is covered by a tendinous aponeurosis, derived from the vastus ex- ternus muscle and fascia lata, it is separated from the external semilunar cartilage by the external inferior arti- The internal lateral ligament is a broad flattened band, attached superiorly to the eminence on the inner surface of the internal condyle ; it passes downwards and forwards, and is inserted into the inner surface and anterior edge of the upper extremity of the tibia; this ligament is from three to four inches in length, and from an inch to an inch and a half in breadth; it is continuous swi^mor/y with the adductor magnus tendon; is expanded the centre, where it intimately adheres to the internal semi- lunar cartilage; is narrow, and pointed inferiorly; its anterior edge is well marked; its fosierior edge is gra- dually lost in the posterior part of the joint; its cutaneous surface is covered by the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus. „ ^. , • ^ j • The ligamentum posticum of Wmslow is placed m an oblique direction at the posterior part of the joint, filling up the posterior intercondyloid fossa; it is implanted in- feriorly into the internal and posterior part of the tibia, passes upwards and outwards, and is inserted into the external condyle of the femur; it is perforated by the azygos artery, a branch of the popliteal, and may be con- sidered as being derived from, and forming one of the insertions of, the semimembranosus muscle ; its posterior surface has resting on it the popliteal artery, from which it is separated by a lymphatic gland; its antertor surface corresponds with the articulation.

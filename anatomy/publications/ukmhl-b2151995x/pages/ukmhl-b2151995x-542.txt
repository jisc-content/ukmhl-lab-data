526 SURGERY. Thus, the hernia is first protruded against the internal abdominal ring, pushes before it the peritoneum, which forms the hernial sac; emerging through the internal ring, it descends in front of the spermatic cord, and here re- ceives a covering from the fascia propria, alias tascia transversalis; descending still further, it escapes beneath the lower margin, or between the fibres of the internal oblique muscleâ€”here it enters the sheath of the cremaster muscle, and continues its course to the external abdominal rino-: it now, turning forwards, passes through this open- ing where it becomes invested by the external spout-like fascia, alias, intercolumnar; it now descends into the scrotum, covered still further by the superficial lascia, and the integuments. It thus is covered by the znteffu. ment, the superficial fascia, the intercolumnar fascia, the sheath of the cremaster muscle, the fascia transversalis, and the peritoneum, forming the hernial sac. Scarpa's fascia may be omitted m the descnption of the covering, as it is only part of the superficial fascia. As a hernia descends into the scrotum, beneath the coverings of the spermatic cord, it finally arrives imme- diltely above the testis, in which position it is retained by the attachment of the spermatic coverings to the upper and back part of this organ, where its vessels and nerves '^The principal points to be attended to, in the anatomy of oblique inguinal hernia, are 1st, its covennffs; 2d, the part of the canal where stricture most frequently occurs; 3d, its relatTon to the epigastric artery, the spermatic cord, and the testis; 4th, the varieties occasionally met with in '^From the distinct enumeration we have just given of the coverings of an oblique inguinal hernia, it might be oncUuird fbat a surgeol when called "P- to opera^e for the relief of a strangulated hernia, should meet w th ittle difficulty in exposing the hernial sac, being enaW d from his knowledge of anatomy to cut through lajer by kver, with the same accuracy as he could turn over the Sves of a book.

VERTEBRAL ARTERY. 337 The principal branches of the subclavian artery are five in number, three of which are given olTfrom its first stage, viz. the vertebral, internal mammary, and thyroid axis,' and the remaining two in its second stage, viz. the cervi- calis profunda, and the superior intercostal. The branches which arise from its first stage are given ofi' from a very small portion of the artery near to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus muscle. Arteria vertebralis is, in general, the first and the largest branch of the subclavian, from the upper and pos- terior part of which it arises; from this it passes upwards, backwards, and a little outwards, sinks into a triangular fossa, between the longus colli on the inner, and the scalenus anticus muscle on the outer side, and enters the toramen in the transverse process of the sixth or fifth cervical vertebra, sometimes that of the fourth, but very rarely of the seventh. It then ascends in the foramina of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebree, anterior to the spmal nerves, until it has passed through the foramen of the vertebra dentata; it here bends outwards, passes through the toramen in the transverse process of the atlas, it then becomes horizontal, winds backwards around the occipito- atlantoidean articulation, enters a triangular space formed by the recti postici muscles posteriorlv, the superior oblique superiorly, and the inferior oblique inferiorly; it then runs upwards and inwards in a groove on the upper surface of the atlas, and perforates the posterior occipito-atlantoideau ligament, sometimes above, sometimes below the sub- occipital nerve; the artery thence ascends forwards and inwards through the foramen magnum, enters the cavity of the cranium, and at the inferior margin of the pons varolii unites with the vertebral artery of the opposite side, to form the basilar artery. ' In the neck the vertebral artery gives off some branches ot minor importance to the surrounding muscles; a few pass from it, which, conducted by the spinal nerve , enteT the spinal canal to supply the spinal marrow. On enter- ing the cranium, the vertebral gives off a few branches to the dura mater, also the arteria cerehelli inferior, and ti e artenae medulte spinalis, anterior and posterior. Arteria cerebdli inferior sometimes arises from tl,e basilar arterv runs backwards and downwards between the par vagum and 15

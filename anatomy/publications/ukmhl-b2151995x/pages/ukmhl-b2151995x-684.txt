668 SUKGEUY. indeed there is but one situation in the human body, namely, at the bend of the elbow, in which we can expect success. Here the artery is superficial, it rests on the lower part of the humerus with the intervention of the brachialis anticus muscle, the nerve does not interfere with the compression, nor is there any resisting fascia, or other structure, to bear it off from the vessel. Not so with the popliteal artery; for the vessel here lies deep: the poph- teal nerve is superficial, and runs almost directly in the course of the artery, and the popUteal fascia with the hamstring tendons resist any compression we can be justified in resorting to; the vein too may be compressed at the same time and thus retard the return of the blood from the lower part of the limb. Independently of these circumstances, the aneurismal tumour may be in such a condition as not to admit of compression, its size may be too great, or the integuments covering it may be in an inflamed and painful state. "When compression is resorted to, the constitutional remedies recommended in the treatment of internal aneurism should be employed. When the tumour appears to diminish in size, its pulsation becoming less distinct, and the limb less painful to the patient, we may expect a favorable termination; on the contrary, if the patient's sufferings are increased, and the integuments of the sac become inflamed without the tumour altering in size, the use of compression is not only hkely to be of no avail, but actually prejudicial, as by a perseverance m its adoption, gangrene of the sac or limb may be the con- sequence. Compression of the artery at a distance from the tumour, has been practised during the last five or six years with considerable success, so much so as to warrant a trial of it in most cases of popliteal aneurism. Pressure is not applied in the mode above discribed but by means of a tourniquet (named Italian and others) which by means of two pads presses upon two points only, namely upon the artery and opposite side of the limb, the inter- vening parts being free to allow of the collateral circula- tion. In some cases the pain is excessive beyond the patient's endurance, in others it causes sloughing of the skin, but in many has been perfectly successful 'Â«'ithm a short period, sometimes as little as six or seven days, ine

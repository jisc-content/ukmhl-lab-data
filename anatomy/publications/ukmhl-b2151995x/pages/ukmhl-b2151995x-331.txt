Eamus meningeus parvus. This is a very small artery jhich ascends and passes into the cranium, throuo-h the foramen ovale, to supply the dura mater. ^ The branches of the meningeal arteries are principally lost in the supply of the bones of the cranium. The dura mater thus acts as an mternal periosteum to the skuU; indeed it would appear that It IS more essential to its support than the external perios- fron?tt° wf'I ^egree of vascularity, and from its separation from the bones, whether produced by external violence or other WTW^ '''"'■''^'y ^"""^^-^ "^''••osis or death of the bone.

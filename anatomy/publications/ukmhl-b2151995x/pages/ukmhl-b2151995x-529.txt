These symptoms are, in general, combined with great debility and faintness of the patient; but, as such symptoms may be present ia simply pene- trating, or even superficial wounds, they are not of them- selves indications of any of the viscera having been wounded. The treatment of this accident consists in closmg the wound in the viscus, if it be one of the intes- tines that is injured, by one or more points of the inter- rupted suture, returning the intestine, and bringing the edges of the wound together. The continued suture is preferred by Mr. Guthrie. In the course of a few days an encysted abscess forms around the ligatures, which separate and escape, with the contents of the abscess, into the cavity of the intestine, and are thus discharged. Where the wounded intestine cannot be so secured, nature accomplishes a cure by an eflfusion of lymph around the wounded portion of intestine, which limits, or altogether prevents, the escape of matter from its cavity. Strict rest and the antiphlogistic regimen should be observed in order to guard against peritonitis. Purgatives, as exciting the action of the intestines, should be avoided for a few days nlnl A f P^^^trating wounds of the abdomen prove fiital, either from peritonitis or from hemorrhage, where a large blood vessel has been injured.

A truss should be applied so as to obliterate the communication between the cavities of the tunica vaginalis and peritoneum. "When this is accom- plished any fluid remaining in the tunica vaginalis is easily absorbed by the use of discutieut lotions. DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. Hcemorrhoids or Piles.â€”These are, by far, the most fre- quent of all the diseases of the lower part of the rectum; few individuals past the meridian of life being completely free from them.

SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 333 triangle before alluded to, the base being the subclavian artery: here the vessel is crossed by the par vagum and recurrent nerve, and the cardiac filaments of the sympa- thetic ; the phrenic nerve crosses the artery a little to the outer side of them, beneath the conflux of the internal jugu ar and subclavian veins. It is also sometimes crossed by the vertebral veins. Posterior to the artery, in this stage, are the inferior laryngeal or recurrent nerve, the sympathetic and first dorsal nerves, the spinal column, and the longus colh muscle; more externally, it rests on the cone of the pleura. In the first stage only, as above described, the right and left subclavian arteries differ. The chief points of difference may be summed up as foUows; the right arises from the arteria innominata, the left from the arch of the aorta • the righ IS larger but shorter than the left, is more superfic al and takes a more transverse course, and differs in itsStTon' to the par vagum and vena innominata; the left only is related to the thoracic duct and oesophagus, and is more connected with the pleura.

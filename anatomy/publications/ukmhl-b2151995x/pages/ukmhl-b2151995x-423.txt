PLANTAR BEGIDN. 407 of one of the arteries of the leg which has been wounded and not the trunk itself; the effused blood may then become absorbed, and the wound in the vessel closed. The numerous tendons around the anide-joint add much to the security of this articulation ; thus it is protected behind and towards the inner side by the tendons of the tibiahs posticus, flexor communis, and flexor pollicis; and by the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis, exter- nally, so that dislocation is rendered almost impossible in this direction; secured too in front by the ligaments and the greater width of the astragalus, this articulation eniovs that degree of security which is so necessary to one upon which the whole weight of the body is thrown. The tendons around the articulation, by the yielding of the muscular fibres connected with them, communicate also to It a degree of elasticity, which adds much to the srace and ease of motion, so essential to perfect progression. PLANTAR REGION, OR SOLE OF THE FOOT. The integuments covering the sole of the foot are remarkable for their great density and strength, even at the earhest periods of life, particularly in thos^e situation where they are most exposed to pressure, viz., over the heel, the outer side of the foot, and across the articulations between the metatarsus and phalanges. Beneath these a large quantity of dense granulated adipose substance exists, which serves as an elastic cushion to bear off" the effects of violent shocks, communicated in active exertion fibrous bands pass from the granulated fat which connect It to the plantar aponeurosis: this fat is most abundant where the greatest pressure is exerted on the foot On removing this the plantar aponeurosis or fascia is brnnaif into view. This is a dens^ layer of fibrous aponeuS structure, triangular in shape, which invests theCft 2 s m the sole of the foot; it arises, narrow but st on/pfs teriorly, from the os calcis, passes forwards exSC" and near the metatarso-phalangeal articulatinn?. nto five distinct processes each of whid at i 1, h^'^'' mto two portions, which pass forward^Ld ^ t into the lateral ligaments of theTrH.M . ^i'^*""*^^ Bheaths of the flex'or tendons, p at ""0'"' sends in septa between the rnn.Z.'itZ Zr^^^T,

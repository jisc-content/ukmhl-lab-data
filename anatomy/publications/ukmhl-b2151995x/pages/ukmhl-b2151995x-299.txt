THE NECK. 283 in the female; they take a direction upwards and inwards, or from the shoulder towards the chin. _ On raising the platysma-myoides muscle, the superficial fascia, the external jugular vein, sotne branches of nerves, and the deep cervical fascia, are brought into view. The external jugular vein is formed, in the substance of the parotid gland, by the junction of the internal maxillary and temporal veins; from this point it descends, nearly in the vertical direction, but inclining somewhat backwards, crosses the outer surface of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and at the posterior margin of this muscle, a short distance above the clavicle, it dips into the subclavian vein, in the posterior inferior triangle of the neck. At the upper part ot the neck, the external jugular vein is small in size, but as It descends it increases considerably, especially a little above its termination, from its receiving the blood from many superficial veins in this region. In general it com- municates by a transverse branch with the internal iugular vein. Not unfrequently a second external iugular vein is met with near the mesial hne of the neck : this is called the anteiior jugular vein; where it exists, it almost con- stantly communicates, by a branch which crosses the sterno-mastoid muscle, with the external jugular vein, which is in such cases smaller than usual. When a cor- responding branch exists on the opposite side, the two veins unite in front of the trachea and immediately above the sternum, so as to form an arch, the convexity of which is directed downwards, a variety that will embarrass the sur- geon not a little, should he be called on to perform the operation of tracheotomy; they terminate in the venae inuommatae or internal jugular veins.

6 ANATOMY. when it has been stated to have been injected; their presence, however, is inferred from the effects of disease. Cartilage is thickest in the centre, when it covers a con- vexity,—in the circumference, when it lines a concavity. All the parts comprising the moveable articulations are' lined by synovial membrane. This is an exceedingly thin, delicate membrane, belonging to the class of serous mem- branes ; it presents a smooth polished appearance, is transparent, destitute of red vessels and nerves, at least in a healthy state, forms a shut sac, secretes a glairy, trans- parent fluid, termed synovia, which lubricates the interior of the joint, and thus obviates the effects of friction; it cannot be demonstrated satisfactorily where it covers the cartilages, but is distinctly visible in other situations ; it is frequently confounded with the capsular ligament. CLASSIFICATION OF ARTICULATIONS. The Articulations may be divided into complete and nox-complete. Planiform. Where the surfaces in contact are plane, or nearly so, and possess the least motion. 'Angular—perfect \i\\ert the mo- tions are confined to flexion and extension, as in the elbow. Imperfect where they also allow of slight lateral motion, as in the knee and ankle. GiNGLYMus. { Lateral.—AVhere the surfaces are convex and concave, and allow of rotatorj' motion, as in the articulations between the radius and ulna, and the odontoid process of the den- tata and atlas. En-Arthrosis. .Where the bones present a hall and cup, or deep excavation, and where they enjoy every motion, that is, flexion, extension, adduc- tion, abduction, rotation, and cir- cumduction, as in the hip. Where the bones present a ball and socket, or superficial excava- tion, and either enjoy every mo- tion, as in the shoulder, or where its motions are more confined, as in the teniporo-maxillary articula- tion. 60 • S S O T3 O e^H o cn •i-i §-1 S n fl fl o -3 fl a a '■a o fl S Arthrosis.

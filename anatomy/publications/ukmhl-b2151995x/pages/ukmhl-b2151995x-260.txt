244 ANATOMY. The arterial branches for the supply of the stomach are all from the c^Uac axis. They are, the coronaria ventri- culi ov superior (jnstric, distributed to the smaller curva- ture ; the superior and inferior pyloric, to its pyloric end; the vasa brevia, to the great cul-de-sac and the yastro- epiploica sinistra and dextra, to the larger curvature. Its nerves are chiefly from the par vagum, with some filaments from the sympathetic. i Its veins pass chiefly into the splenic vein, and its ab- sorbents into the thoracic duct. THE INTESTINES. The Intestines are divided into small and large. The leneth of the human intestinal canal is aboat six times greater than that of the trunk; and is still longer m pro- Tjortion in graminivorous animals. The small intestines are the duodenum, jejunum, and ilium. In length they form about two thirds of the intes- ^''^The'^'small intestines, as also the large, have the same coats as the stomach, but with some exceptions m rela- tion to the peritoneum. These coats are generally stated to be three. The muscular coat consists ot two series of fibi' s, longitudinal outside, circular inside. The mucous or vUlous coat, which is much the largest ui the small mtes ines, is Arranged in folds, named valvule conni- ventes, to afford a larger surface for absori^on and^o cause some retardation in the passage of th chyle Th^ coat is studded with mucous follicles; those of the duo denum^^e small conglomerate glands with --tujg d-J. and are named ^Zanr/«/^ Brunner.; ^^^^^.^^^ >J l^^^'^JJ and ilium, glandule, -y^^-'d^'^ ^^T^L^tltSl there exist numerous other small glands formmg the salt tary glands, and the follicles of Lierberkuhn.

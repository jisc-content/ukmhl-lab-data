It is well exposed by gently drawing down- wards the spermatic cord. . , , j Dissect off the fascia propria, and the internal abdo- minal ring, although less defined than the external, is com- pletely exposed. It is the inner opening or commence- ment of the inguinal canal; it may be now seen to be a Uttle nearer the ilium than the symphysis pubis, its inner margin being precisely midway between these two points ; it lies nearly opposite the external iliac artery, and about the half or three quarters of an inch above Poupart s Ueament. Directly above it the lower fibres of the trans- vtrsalis muscle cross from their origin, from the external third or half of Poupart's ligament, almost transversely inwards, to become identified with the internal obhque muscle, and implanted with it into the '^o^J^^^^VrfiW; Occasionally, as Mr. Guthrie has described, a few fibres of the transversaUs muscle pass behind the cord. Along the internal and inferior part of the internal ring, and contained in the transversalis fascia, ascends the epigastric This artery arises from the external iliac, a little above Poupart's ligament; it at first descends then curves up- waX winding round the cul-de-sac of the pentoneum, Ind iielasceSds inwards, enters the sheath of the rectus musde and terminates by anastomosing with the internal mammary artery.

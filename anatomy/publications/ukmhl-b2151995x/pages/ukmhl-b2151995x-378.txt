362 ■REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. follows: The .ulnar artery supplies the ulnar side of the little finger, and the opposed sides of the little, ring, middle, and index fingers; the radial artery supphes the radial side of the thumb, and the opposed sides of the thumb and index fingers. The median nerve supplies the radial side of the thumb, and the opposed sides of the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers; the ulnar nerve supplies the ulnar side of the little finger, and the opposed sides of the little and ring fingers. On the back of the hand the posterior branches of the musculo-spiral and ulnar nerves supply respectively two fingers and a half; the former, the thumb, the index, and one half the middle finger ; the latter the remaining fingers. The surgeon is very frequently called on to tie the ulnar artery in conse°quence of wounds of the palmar arch of arteries. We have already said that the palm of the hand is one of the situations, the so'le of the foot being the other, in which wounds of the contained arteries are treated by tying the artery leading to the injured vessels, contrarv to the general practice of cutting down on the wounded artery, and securing it above and below the wound. The cause of this deviation from the general practice m these instances will be found in the number of vessels, nerves, and tendons in both the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, the disturbance and unavoidable injury of which in looking tor the injured vessel would more than counterbalance the advantage that might be derived from tying the artery where injured. \\hm, therefore, the superficial palmar arch of arteries has been wounded, and that compression by means of portions of lint or sponge has been found ineffectual in restraining the haemorrhage, the ulnar artery should be tied in the lower third of the forearm In some cases, this operation, although followed l^J tl^^ compresses in the palm of the hand, has been found msufficient to restrain the bleeding in consequence of tlie free communicanon that exists between the superficial and deep palmar ai-ches of arteries; hence it may be necessary to tie also the radial artery. The ulnar artery is also tied occasionally for the cure of aneu- rism; but, as this disease rarely affects arteries of such a size, it is seldom that the operation is required for this paiticu ar V^^^f^- .The ulnar artery may be tied with facility in either the middle or lower third of the forearm, by making an incision, about two inches and a half in length, through the integuments and tascia over the course of the artery, along the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon. On separating the edges of the ^^o"""^ » will be found necessary to cut through a thm layer ot lascia, which binds down the tendon; this haying been done, the tenaon is to be raised, when the artery is at once brought into Me\> , having been sufficiently detached from the ulnar nerve, wnica

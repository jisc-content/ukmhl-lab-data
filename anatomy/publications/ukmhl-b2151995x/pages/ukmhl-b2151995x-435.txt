COMPOSITION OV SECRETIONS AND EXCllETIONS. 419 Human milk differs but slightly from the foregoing, con- taining more sugar and less butter and caseine. Human milk is remarkable for its difBculty of coagulation. Clriite is a limpid yellowish fluid, with a slightly acid reaction, and averaging in specific gravity 1-022. It is speedily decomposed by exposure to air and heat, am- monia being generated in great abundance. The urine may be looked upon as the great outlet for nitrogen from the system. It removes also water and foreign soluble matters that get into the blood. The average quantity of urine voided daily in health is about 32 ounces. The analysis according to Berzelius is the following : Water • . . . 933- Urea . . . ; 30-10 Lactates and extractives . . 17-14 Sulphates of Potash and Soda . . 6-87 Chloride of Sodium . .4-45 Phosphate of Soda . . . 2-94 „ of Ammonia . . i-gs „ of Lime and Magnesia . 1- Hydrochlorate of Auimonia . .1-5 Uric acid. . . _ j. Mucus of bladder . . . .32 Silica ... -n^i 1000- In a diseased state the urine may contain other com- ponents, such as albumen, sugar, or sulphuric acid. Bile is also sometimes observed, and frequently uric acid is found in increased quantity. The sweat appears to consist of water and salts, together with certain gases; nitrogen also appears to be evolved though m much less quantity than in the urine. From the difficulties attending such a subject, the composition of the sweat has not been fully ascertained. The secretion of the sebacic glands has not vet been examined. Mucics differs greatly in its qualities, according to the part from which it has been effused; it is insoluble, although miscble with water, soluble in alkalies but pre- cipitated by acids. The mucus of the nose contains water raucous matter, salts of soda, potash and lime, albumen and animal matter. *

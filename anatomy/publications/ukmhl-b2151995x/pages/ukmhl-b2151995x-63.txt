47 THE LIGAMENTUM TERES. most of its animal matter, and thus gives rise to its being frequently fractured at this period of life: in the young subject it hardly exists. THE LIGAMENTS OF THE HIP-JOINT. The ligaments of the hip-joint are the cajisular and the accessory ligaments, situated externally; the cotyloid ligament and ligamentum teres, internally. The capsular ligament is by far the strongest and most perfect ligament of the kind in the human body; it arises superiorly from the outer surface of the brim of the acetabulum beyond the cotyloid liicament, passes from this downwards and outwards, envelops the head of the bone, and IS inserted into the neck which it closely embraces' extending anteriorly as far as the anterior inter-trochanteric line ; hut posteriorly only as far as about three fourths of an inch, from the posterior inter-trochanteric line; which explains how fracture of the neck of the femur can occur partly withm and partly beyond the capsular ligament, fh.s ligament is strong and thick anteriorly, and is also strengthened by the tendinous origin of the rectus femoris muscle, and the accessory ligament; it is thin and weak towards the thyroid foramen, it is perforated by the tendon ot the rectus femoris muscle ; on its external surface it is covered by numerous muscles which assist in strengthening the joint; on its inner surface it is lined by synovial membrane. ^ j-^uvidi The accessory ligament is situated on the anterior part ot the joint; It arises from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilmm, expands, passes downwards and backwards, and is inserted into the lesser trochanter • it strengthens the articulation in front, supports the head of he (emur, and prevents too great extension of the joint; muscles'«i '^^/^^^ P^-^gnus and iliacus internu Cf wb r^^^ ^'/'°™^^"''^ '''' ^'^P-'^^'^ted by a large ouisa, which sometmies communicates with the ioint- post^orly; ,t is identified with the capsular igamen^t ' frni ^"'"''f'r^' i^'t^r-articidar ligament arises by TwfhraSf onfr "''1 ^^^'^^^-^ cCmference U n ''''^ ^'^^ ""^^'h in its implan ed inf<; 1^?"" o^xi^^n\., and is implanted into the depression in the head of the femur.

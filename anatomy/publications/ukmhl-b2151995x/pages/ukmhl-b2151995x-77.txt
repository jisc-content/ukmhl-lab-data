THE SCAPULA. 61 eminence, termed the coracoid process; this occupies, at its root or origin, the remaining part of this edge as far as about a line from the glenoid cavity; its upper surface, rough, gives attachment to the conoid and trapezoid liga- ments, and a few fibres of the omohyoid muscle; its under surface is smooth and concave; its internal edge gives insertion to the pectorahs minor; its external, to the coraco-acromial ligament; from its point arise the coraco- brachialis muscle and short head of the biceps: it serves as a protection to the shoulder-joint, which it overhangs towards its internal side. The posterior or vertebral border, or base of the scapula, is turned backwards and inwards towards the spine, to which it is nearer superiorly than inferiorly; it gives attachment to several muscles. The inferior or axillary border is shorter but stronger than the preceding ; it extends from the inferior angle to the glenoid cavity. The posterior angle of the scapula is that formed by the junction of the superior and posterior edges; it is rounded off, and gives insertion to the levator anguli scapulae. The inferior angle is formed by the junction of the posterior and axillary borders ; it is more acute than the posterior, and is covered by the origin of the teres major muscle and the latissiraus dorsi. The anterior angle is formed by the junction of the superior and axiUary borders; it presents a superficial concave articular surface, ovoid or pyriform in shape, its long axis directed vertically, large inferiorly, narrow and pointed superiorly, for articulating with the humerus and forming the shoulder-joint; it is termed the glenoid cavity IS surrounded by a ridge of bone, and by the cotyloid hgament, and is supported by the anatomical neck, which 18 that portion situated behind the edge of the cavity and in front of the root of the coracoid process: this o-ivcs origin to the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint^aud IS called anatomical, to distinguish it from the surgical neck, where fracture sometimes occurs; this is posterior 0 the root of the coraco d process, and passes through the notch in the superior border. The scapula articulates with but two bones, the clavicle and humerL its 3: of connection with the trunk is termed syssarcosis.

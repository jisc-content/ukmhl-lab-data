THE TIBIA. 37 internal; of these, the anterior one is commonly named the shin. The inferior or tarsal extremity of the tibia expands, and assumes a quadrilateral shape ; anteriorly it presents a convex extensive surface, into which the ante- rior ligament of the ankle-joint and anterior tibio-fibular hgament are attached, and over which glide the tendons of the anterior muscles of the leg ; posteriorly, a rough surface which gives attachment to the posterior ligament of the ankle-joint, and the posterior tibio-fibular hgament, and is marked towards its inner edge by a superficial groove running downwards and inwards, which gives lodgment to the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis muscle ; externally, is a rough triangular surface, concave, which gives lodgment to the fibula, and attachment to hgaments which connect these bones together ; internally, the tibia descends farther than in any other direction, and presents a thick and shghtly convex quadrilateral projection, termed the internal molleolus. This eminence is situated on a plane anterior to the body or shaft of the bone ; internally, it is rough, convex, and covered only by the integuments; externally, it is marked by an articulating surface of a pyriform shape, to correspond with a similar surface on the astragalus, for the formation of the ankle-joint; it is continuous with the articulating surface of the lower part of the tibia, which it joins at a right angle; posteriorly, it is grooved for the transmission of the tibialis posticus and flexor communis tendons; inferiorly, it tapers a httle, descends lower in front than behind, and gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the ankle-joint. Inferiorly, the lower extremity of the tibia presents a surface covered by cartilage for articulation with the upper surface of the astragalus; it is somewhat quadrilateral concave from before backwards, convex transversely, owing to a ridge which transverses it in the antero-posterior du-ection, ,t is wider anteriorly than posteriorly, and broader externally than internally; it is bounded externally by the articulating surface for the fibula; internally hy the internal malleolus, anteriorly and posteriorly bv the projecting edges of the tibia. ' The tibia articulates with three bones: the femur, the libula, and the astragalus ; its structure is like that of the

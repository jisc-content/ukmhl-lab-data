INJURIES OP THE THOUAX. 509 whence it is soon diffased over the rest of the body, giving rise to general emphysema. As the air will continue to collect and be extravasated in the cellular tissue of the body so long as the external wound remains open, this should be closed as soon as possible, when the extrava- sated air will become absorbed after some time. Should the dyspnoea be urgent, from the quantity of air collected in the chest, a portion of this may be removed by closin* the wound during inspiration, and opening it during ex^ piration. The difficulty of breathing will be still further relieved by taking blood from the arm, by which the lungs will be unloaded, the quantity of blood circulating in them being lessened, and any disposition to inflammation checked. The air, extravasated in the cellular tissue of the body, is productive of no bad consequences, being absorbed m a few days. If the intercostal artery be wounded It may bleed either externally or into the cavity ot the chest: in the former case the injury becomes at once apparent, when the wounded vessel should be se- cured j in the latter case, the blood flows into the cavity ot the chest, where it may collect in large quantity before tbe injury is suspected, as the symptoms produced by the loss of blood may be readily confounded with those con- nected with the wound of the chest. If a portion of card be now introduced into the wound, the blood will flow along Its surface, and so appear externally. Under these circumstances, the bleeding vessel should be at once se- cured with the ligature ; and when this cannot be accom- p ished from the artery being lodged in the groove in the edge ot the rib, a compress, or piece of prepared sponge, with a ligature attached, to prevent it passing into the t'Z 'i™-' ''"^''^^ ^ f^^"^^ Period, should be introduced into the wound, -so as to compass the bleeding vessel We can resort to no means Z the re- tTetwtrtrt'^^l T'^^^^' ^ "-"kYto fore trus L L'k ■ ''°r' r.^^^^''^' must there- lore trust to Its being absorbed.

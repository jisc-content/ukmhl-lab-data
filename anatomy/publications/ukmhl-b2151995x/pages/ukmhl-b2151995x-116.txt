100 ANATOMY. is the contracted part immediately beneath the body, and which is surrounded by the gums; the fang ov fangs are those processes which are sent down into the alveoU ana bv means of which the teeth are firmly held in situ, bach tooth contains in its interior a canal, which commences at the root of the fang by a very minute ^P^^ture, and from this passes up into tlie body where it is largest; this cavity a imes somewhat the shape of the tooth, and possesses a distinct process from each fang that it -^y ^^^^ is smooth internally, and contains a soft ^^^b'-an^ pulpy substance, termed the pulp of the tooth. this is LppLd with vessels and nerves, although the latter can- not be traced into the body or crown. The crown of the tooth is uncovered by periosteum, but the remaining par J possess this covering from the "^^^^^ downwards : thi^^^^^ connected also with the socket of the tooth which it hues , at the neck it is firmly attached to the gums The teeth of each jaw in the adult are divided into— four incisors, two cuspidati or canine, four bicuspidati, six TOolares or grinders. The indsors are placed in the centre of the aws and are the only teeth of which the body is fla teiied; the fong is single, and marked laterally by a longitudinal Sve flatLed in a contrary direction to the crown, Sl^'latally, .hilst its -terior and po^^^^^^^^^^^ are narrow ; the enamel is thickest antenoilj t^e ^n^^^o^ of the upper iaw are larger than those of the lo^^r, tne ?wo miidle ar^e the largest, their fangs are -Jher round^^^^ and they project more in front so as to ovcrla the m dei ones - the middle incisors of the lower jaw are the smallest, the lateral ones larger. , The cuspidati or canine teeth are placed one on eacli side external to the incisors; they possess ^Ja^g;/"^ long fang, which causes a remarkable prominence on e outer surface of the alveoli, and extends J-p l Uo the hone- the body or crown is conical, with the apex tree, c n":;x,td pr'ojecting anteriorly beyond the ot^^r ee h particularly in the lower jaw; those o^ ^^^^ ^JJ.

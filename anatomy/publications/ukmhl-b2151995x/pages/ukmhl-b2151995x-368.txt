352 REGIONAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. described as formed by the anterior and iiosterior radial veins. The median vein commences on the anterior surface of the wrist by means of small branches from the palm of the hand; ascends in the forearm, between the basilic and cephalic veins ; and at a short distance below the elbow, terminates by dividing into three branches, the median- cephalic, the median-basilic, and the deep median vein : of these the median-basilic ascends inwards, in front of the semilunar fascia of the biceps and the brachial artery to join the basilic vein ; the median-cephalic ascends out- wards to join the cephalic vein; and the deep median sinks deep and joins one of the venae comites. These veins are accompanied by branches from the internal cuta- neous and external cutaneous nerves. When about to perform the operation of venesection, at the bend of the elbow, foiu- veins present themselves, viz.,thebasiUc, cephalic, median-basilic, and median-cephalic. Of these the median-basilic is most superficial, and would be selected but for its relation to the brachial artery, being only separated from this vessel by the semilunar fascia of the biceps. So great, therefore, is the risk of wounding the artery here, that the inexperienced practitioner at least should always" prefer some other of the veins: of these the median-cephalic or liasilic is to be preferred, the cephahc being objectionable on account of its rolUug too freely beneath the point of the lancet. On removing the superficial fascia, the semilunar fascia of the biceps and the fascia of the forearm are exposed. The former is derived from the anterior surface of the tendon of the biceps a little above the bend of the elbow, â– whence it descends inwards, taking a curved course towards the internal condyle, into which, and the fascia of the forearm, its fibres are implanted. The superior edge of this fascia is distinct, concave, seldom reaching as high as the level of the inner coudyle, is directed upwards and inwards, and inferiorly is lost in the fascia of the forearm. This fascia then may be observed to cross the brachial artery, passing between it and the median-basilic vein, and hence serves as a partial protection to the artery, in venesection. From the resistance of this fascia, a circumscribed aneurism is generally formed at the bena of the elbow, when the brachial artery is wounded here. We may have, however, the other forms of aneurism

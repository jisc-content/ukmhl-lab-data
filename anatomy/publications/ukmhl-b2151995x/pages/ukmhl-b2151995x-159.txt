THE ARACHNOID MEMBRANE. 243 against the inner wall The carotid or cavernous plexus of the sympathetic also surrounds the internal carotS artery m this situation. ^^oua Th^ clinoid sinuses are situated one before and the other behind the pituitary body from which they receive the venous blood by minute veins. The clinoid%inuses are very small, and form, by communications with the caver- nous sinuses, the circular sinus of Kidley The superior petrosal sinus, on each side, extends from the posterior part of the cavernous sinus to about th^ middle of the lateral sinus, in which it terminates Its course is backwards and outwards, and it runT lodged in a groove on the ridge which separates the superior from the posterior surface of the petrosal portion of the teZoial bone In size it is much smaller than the foUowing^ Ihe inferior petrosal sinus, much shorter than the nre ceding runs in a groove formed by the adjacent borders of the sphenoid temporal and occipital bones. Its course is from the posterior and internal narf nf , The Arachnoid membrane, so called from its resembUn.

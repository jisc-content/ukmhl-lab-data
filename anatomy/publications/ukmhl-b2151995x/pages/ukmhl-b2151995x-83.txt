THE ULNA. The Vina is situated in the internal and posterior part of the fore-arm, large and irregular above; it gradually diminishes as it passes downwards; is triangular in the centre, exceedingly small, and circular interiorly; it is longer than the radius, and passes much higher up on the arm. It may be divided into a superior- and inferior ex- tremity, and a body or shaft. The superior extremity is the large irregular portion which articulates with the humerus; on it are two large processes, a posterior and an anterior : the posterior, called the olecranon, ascends almost directly upwards from the shaft of the bone, being the highest part of the ulna; superiorly, it gives insertion to the triceps muscle; pos- teriorly, it is n^arked by a smooth, elongated, triangular surface, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa mucosa; internally, it gives attachment to the internal lateral liga- ment of the elbow-joint, and the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle; anteriorly, it is covered by cartilage, and forms part of the great sigmoid cavity. The anterior or coronoid process projects from the ante- rior surface of the bone; it is pointed and triangular, and turned a little upwards : it gives insertion to the brachiahs anticus muscle inferiorly; superiorly, it is concave, and covered with cartilage; internally, it projects, and gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament, and the pronator teres and flexor sublimis muscles ; externally, it is marked with a concave articular surface, elongated from before backwards, termed the lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, which receives the lip or edge of the upper extremity of the radius; in front of and behind this surface is attached the orbicular ligament of the radius. The olecranon and coronoid processes are connected anteriorly by a smooth articular surface, named the great sigmoid cavity, concave trom above downwards, convex from side to side, partially divided by a transverse depression into two surfaces, of whicii the upper vertical portion is the larger.

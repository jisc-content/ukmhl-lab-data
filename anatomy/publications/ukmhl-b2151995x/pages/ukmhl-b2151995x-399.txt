ARTERIA FEMORALIS. 383 j'ield to the judicious use of antiphlogistic remedies, a free and early incision becomes necessary, not only to give exit to any matter that may have formed, but also to relieve the tension of the fascia, and thus lessen the inflammation and alleviate the sufferings of the patient. Wlien the fascia lata has been raised, the femoral artery and vein, and the anterior crural nerve of the thigh, -will be brought into view by a very little further dissection. The femoral artery pursues its course through that part of the thigh which is generally known by the name of THE FEMORAL REGION. Although no natiural boundaries exist to separate this region from the others of the thigh, we may, for the purposes of description, consider it to comprise the anterior^ and inner part of the thigh, bounded above by Poupart's ligament, below by the knee-joint, and extending on either side as far as on a level with the femur. In this region are the principal vessels of the lower extremities : the first of those we shall proceed to is the ARTERIA FEMORALIS. The external iliac artery emerging from beneath Poupart's ligament enters the femoral region and here assumes the name of femoral; from Poupart's ligament, then the femoral artery passes obliquely downwards, backwards, and inwards, first lying on the anterior surface of the femoral region, then on its inner side, and finally, at the junction of the middle and inferior thirds of the thigh, it passes through a tendinous opening in the adductor mag- nus to the back of the thigh, where it enters the popliteal space and assumes the name of pophteal artery. A line drawn from midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and the symphysis pubis to the inner surface of the internal condyle, will nearly indicate the course of the artery. In this course the femoral artery has been divided into three stages, the first being its passage through Scarpa's triangle, the second from the apex of this triang e to the entrance of the vessel into Hunter s canal, and the third being its course in this canal.

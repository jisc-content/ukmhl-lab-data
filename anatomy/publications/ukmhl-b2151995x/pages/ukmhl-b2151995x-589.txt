573 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. the risk there is of the urine becoming extravasated in the cellulai-tissue about the bladder; the third, that the bladder is almost always so contracted in cases of long-continued stricture of the urethra, that it will not rise above the pubes. Tapping the Bladder through the rectum.—The patient being placed on his hands and knees, or as in the operation of lithotomy, introduce the two forefingers of the left hand into the rectum, and feel for the triangular space, on the inferior fundus of the bladder, immediately behind the prostate gland. With the right hand pass the trocar and canula, the point of the trocar being retained within the canula, guided by the forefingers of the left, upwards and forwards (supposing the patient to be in the erect posi- tion) through the rectum into the bladder; withdraw the trocar, allowing the canula to remain, and the urine flows off. It will be necessary, as in the operation above the pubes, to retain the canula in the bladder for a few days, until the canal between the cavities of the bladder and rec- tum become sinuous. The principal objections to this operation are the risk of wounding the peritoneum, pros- tate gland, vasa deferentia, and vesiculee seminales, and the mconvenience which arises from the irregular discharge of the urine through the rectum, wliich is frequently exco- riated by this acrimonious fluid. After tapping the bladder we should endeavour to restore the natural passage as rapidly as possible. Cutting down on and dividing the Stricture.—Thee the" patient as in the operation of Uthotomy, pass a grooved staff down to the stricture, make an incision along the raphe of the perineum down to the urethra, lay open this canal, dividing at the same time the stricture. Withdraw the staff introduce a gum elastic catheter into the bladder and heal the wound in perineo from the bottom Thk operation is to be preferred, for the relief of retention of unne, as it not only removes the immediate sufferines of the patient, but paves the way for the removal of the oriSna disease also. Some recommend opening the ureSra though the perineum, with the trocar and cannln rfafc ^ Eztravmation 0/ Urine.-WUn the relention of urine

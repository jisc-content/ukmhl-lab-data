671 TREATMENT OF ANEURISM. below and above the ligature; it is of a conical shape, with the base towards the ligature, the apex in the contrary- direction, and extends as far as the next anastomosing branch of importance; by degrees the vessel contracts, the lacerated edges of its wounded coats become inflamed, and throw out coagulable lymph, which, causing their adhe- sion, seals up each end of the artery, which then contracts still further, and finally becomes obliterated as far as the extent of the coagulum. The ligature escapes in the following manner: that portion of the vessel inchided in the knot forms a slough, which is gradually detached by the process of ulcerative absorption separating it from the living parts of the vessel; the ligature now is easily with- drawn, or makes its way outwards with the discharge, and the portion of the outer coat embraced by it. We have stated that pulsation returning to the tumour on the third or fourth day is considered a good symptom; when however it appears within twenty-four hours after the operation, it is unfavorable, as indicating (supposing the artery to have been properly secured) the existence of some irregular branch which has conveyed the blood almost directly to the tumour. Such cases should be treated by the use of moderate compression, strict rest, and the antiphlogistic regimen, by which means a suc- cessful issue may be obtained. A limb, on which the operation for the cure of aneurism has been preformed, presents, on examination, in some months or years after the operation, the following ap- pearances : the tied artery has degenerated into a liga- mentous cord upwards, as "far as the next important anas- tomosing branches, and downM'ards through the thigh and popliteal space, as far as the origins of the tibial vessels, oc- casionally a small portion of the artery between the Hgature and popliteal space remains pervious; into tliis the blood is poured, and is again removed by anastomosing branches. The circulation is carried on by the anastomosing branches,' a number of which at first become enlarged, but most of them gradually diminish in size and number, until two or three of the largest arteries are left to perform the ofiice. They present a remarkably tortuous appearance. The operation for the cure of popliteal aneurism may tail in consequence of the supervention of secondary

COMPOUND FRACTURES. 621 of the third or fourth day, granulations are formed by the bone and soft parts, which coalescing close the exter- nal wound, and afterwards consolidate the fracture, the ossific matter being deposited in the granulations which proceed from the bone and periosteum. Compound frac- tures are seldom cured until the tenth or twelfth week after the receipt of the injury. During this time the wound should be dressed daily, or every second or third day, according to the quantity of discharge, and fresh dressings be applied, supported by means of bandages which press moderately on the parts. Hence the advan- tages of the many-tailed bandages over the roller are ap- parent, as they may be removed with facility without any disturbance of the parts. ^ It is very seldom that a compound fracture proceeds to Its termmation without troublesome or dangerous symp- toms. The principal of these are spasmodic twitchines violent inflammation, and secondary heemorrhage ' Spasmodic tioitcUngs of the muscles displace the bones, and cause much distress to the patient These are best treated by placing the limb in that position which relaxes the principal muscles, by the use of cold lotions to dynes ^ exhibition of opium and other ano- Violent wflammation of the This commences generaUy towards the end of the first twenty-four hours after the receipt of the injury, and should be at onc^ combated by the antiphlogistic regimen, as a preventive measure, for the result is likely to be either profuse suppu ration or mortification.

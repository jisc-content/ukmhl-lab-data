The submaxillary gland is crossed or traversed by The Arteria labialis, facialis, vel maxillaris externa This vessel arises from the external carotid artery, imme- diately after, or along with, the lingual artery. From its origin It ascends inwards, and then enters the'inferior edge of the submaxillary gland, and, nearer its posterior ex- tremity, runs through the gland in a tortuous manner, and escapes from its superior edge; it now descends, and turning again upwards and outwards, round the side of the jaw, close to the anterior edge of the masseter muscle: it then runs upwards and inwards to the angle of the mouth whence it ascends almost vertically along the side of the nose to the inner canthus of the eye, where it terminates. Ihe labial artery, at its origin, is concealed by the digastric r^l?l^ r^ ^.1"^ T'^^'''' ^"^^ediately above this it is mbedded m the gland; as it crosses the inferior maxilla. It IS superficial, and may be felt pulsating during life being covered only by the skin, and a'few fibrl of the pktysmf and triangularis oris muscles. As it ascends on tl e face it IS remarkably tortuous, and is partly concealed by the adipose tissue of the cheek and a few fibres of the zygomatic muscles.

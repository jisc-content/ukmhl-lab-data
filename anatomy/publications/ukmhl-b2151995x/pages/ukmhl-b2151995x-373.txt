ARTERTA RADIALIS, 357 From its origin the radial artery descends along the radial side of the forearm to tiie wrist nearly parallel with a line drawn from tlie centre of the elbow to the base or root of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, immediately above which it winds round the outer surface of the carpus, descends a little beneath the extensors of the thumb, turns forwards, passes between the heads of the first and second metacarpal bones, sinks deep into the palm of the hand, and then terminates in the deep palmar arch. In the forearm the radial artery is superficial, being covered only by the integuments and fascia, except in its upper third, where it is overlapped by the convergence of the pronator teres and supinator longus muscles. It rests in the upper third of the forearm on the tendon of the biceps, and some fat, cellular tissue, and nerves, which separate it from the supinator brevis ; in the middle third on the tendon of the pronator radii teres and the radial origin of the flexor sublimis; and in the inferior third on the flexor longus pollicis, and pronator quadratus, and on the extremity of the radius. In the upper third of the forearm, the artery is between the supinator radii longus and pronator radii teres; but in the two lower thirds between the supinator radii longus and flexor carpi radialis. The radial artery is accompanied only in its middle third by a nerve, viz., the musculo-spiral or radial nerve. As the radial artery winds round the outside of the carpus it crosses the external lateral ligament of the wrist, then passes under the tendons of the extensor metacarpi and primi internodii pollicis, between which and the ten- don of the extensor secundi internodii pollicis it may be felt during hfe ; it finally descends beneath this tendon to the cleft between the first and second metacarpal bones. The branches of the radial artery are the followin*: Arteria radialis recurrens arises a little below the elbow- jomt, winds outwards and upwards, and terminates in the tossa between the brachialis anticus and supinator lon-us gmng off branches which anastomose with the anterior branch ot the superior profunda artery From the origin of this artery to within an inch of the lower end of the radius, the radial artery gives off only small branches to the neighbouring muscles. At thia point It gives off the following branches :

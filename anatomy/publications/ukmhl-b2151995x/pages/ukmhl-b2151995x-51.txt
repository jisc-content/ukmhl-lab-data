35 THE PATELLA. THE BOKES OP THE LEG. The bones of the leg consist of the patella, the tibia, and fibula. Tlie Patella is situated at the anterior part of the knee- joint, between the femur above and the tibia below, of a triangular or heart-shape, having its base above, its apex below ; the base of the patella is thick, cut off obliquely upwards and backwards, and gives insertion to the tendon of the rectus femoris, and crureus muscles; its apex narrow and pointed, directed downwards, gives attach- ment to the ligamentum patellte, the anterior surface is convex and rough, and is marked by longitudinal lines produced by the fibres of the rectus tendon, in which this bone is developed, and by small foramina for the trans- mission of vessels; it is cohered by a large bursa mucosa, and by a tendinous aponeurosis, derived from the extensor tendons ; the posterior surface is smooth and incrusted with cartilage, as it enters into the formation of the knee- joint; it is divided by a ridge running nearly vertically with a slight degree of obliquity inwards into two unequal portions, an external and internal: the external large, corresponds to the articulating surface on the anterior part of the external condyle of the femur, the internal smaller, and is in contact with the internal condyle : the lateral edges are thin, convex, and irregular, and give insertion to the vasti muscles. Its structure is spongy, covered with a thin layer of compact tissue ; it is developed by a single point of ossi- fication which is deposited in the substance of the rectus tendon, from which it derives the appearance of longitu- dinal fibres remarkable on its anterior surface; it is not completely ossified until many years after birth, and may be considered more properly as a sesamoid bone; it arti- culates only with the femur, being connected with the tibia by ligament; in the extended position of the knee-joint it rests on the anterior surface of the condyles of the femur, but in the fi.exed position corresponds to the interval between the two bones. The muscles attached to it areâ€” Rectus femoris. Vastus extermis. Crureus. internus.

NON-AZOTISED SUBSTANCES. 415 It is similar in compositiou to the hydrated cyanate of ammonia. Uric acid is another azotised substance always existing in small, sometimes in large, quantities in the urine. It is very sparingly soluble in water, and is generally combined with some alkah in the urine. It gives a magnificent purple colour when mixed with nitric acid and exposed to heat. Its formvda is,— Carbon, 10; Hydi-ogen, 4; Nitrogen, 4; Oxygen, 6. Choleic acid, the peculiar acid of the bile in which it exists, combined with soda, is composed of— Carbon, 44; Hydrogen, 40; Nitrogen, 1; Sulphur,!; Oxygen, 9. NON-AZOTISED SUBSTANCES. These are the various fats, the secretions of the sebaceous glands, sugar, butter, and certain salts, though some of these are only found in diseased secretions. Certain alkahes and acids are sometimes found in excretions, but mostly when these are in a more or less diseased condition. The fats may be considered as substances secreted to supply the waste of the body caused by respiration and the production of animal heat; for when an animal is limited in its supply of food, the adipose substance quickly disappears; and those animals which hybernate are ob- served to be quite fat when they first begin to sleep, and are considerably reduced by the time that winter is over. Animal fats and oils are composed of three proximate principles, called margarine, oleine, and stearine, each of these being formed by a pecuHar base, called glycerine, allied with either margaric, oleic, or stearic acids. The union of these acids with a free alkaU, and with the separation of glycerine, constitutes the formation of soap. The composition of these substances is the following : Carbon. Hydrogen. Oxygen.

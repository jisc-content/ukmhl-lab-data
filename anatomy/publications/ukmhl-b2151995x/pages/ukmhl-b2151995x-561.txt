FEMOEAL HERNIA. 545 graduaUy lost in the cellular coverings of the femoral vessels in the thigh. The femoral artery and vein are not in close contact whilst contained in the sheath, but are separated by a septum or partition, which passes from its anterior to its posterior wall; and which, thus opposing the separa- tion of these walls, prevents the descent of a hernia between the femoral vessels and the fascia transversalis or anterior waU of the femoral sheath. In addition to tnis, tlie fascia transversalis is connected by cellular tissue to the cellular covering of the vessels, so as to assist materially in preventing the descent of a hernia in tnis direction. .fS'^A ''^^ ^^'^"''^1 ^^ssels, we have just liTl ^^ fPf^""' tlie transmission of the absorbent vessels from the lower extremity.

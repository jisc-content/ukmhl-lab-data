ARTJCRIA TIBIALIS POSTERIOR. 405 latter part of its course, it runs first between the flexor digitorum brevis and abductor minimi digiti, covered only by the integuments and fascia; but afterwards sinks deep m the sole of the foot, between the adductor pollicis and transversalis pedis, covered by the short and long flexor tendons and the lumbricales. The plantar arch besides givmg several branches to the muscles and other soft parts in the foot, sends off the following • Arterice perforanies proceed from the upper surface of the plantar arch, supply the interossei muscles, and anastomose mth hranches from the anterior tibial artery. Arteri^ digitales, four in number, arise from the convexity of the plantar arch; the first supplies the outer side of the little toe, the second, third and fourth, run forwards to the clefts between the fourth and fifth, third and fourth, second and third toes where each divides into two branches, which supply the opposed sur! faces of the second, third, fourth, and fifth toes, near the anterLr extremity of each of which they anastomose fredy together The plan tarartenes are accompanied by the plantar nerve!; these are the termmating branches of the posterior tibial ne^ve which b^urcates also between the origins of the abductor pdlicis S two branches, the internal and external plantar nerves The plantar nerve is the larger of the tv^o; it passel forwards above the abductor pollicis, and supplies the first seLnr /nH third toes, and the inner half of the firth toe, a fn'g the fdes of which the branches of nerves accompany the digUd arteries to the pulp of the toes, in which they'are lost, as°in the fingers The external plantar nerve accompanies the plantar arch of artenes and is lost in the supply of the Uttle toe and the outer half of the fourth toe. The plantar nerves, in their course to th^ toes.^send off numerous branches to the musde^iu ^sole o?

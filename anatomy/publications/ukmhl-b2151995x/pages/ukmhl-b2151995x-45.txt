THE PELVIS. 29 wards, and is implanted into the tuberosity of the ischium, whence it sends a prolongation forwards to be continuous externally with the origins of the hamstring muscles, in- ternally with the obturator fascia, and is prolonged ante- riorly into a process which assists in binding down the internal pudic artery; this ligament is somewhat of an hour-glass shape, narrow and thick in its centre, broad and thin at its extremities; its outer surface gives origin to the gluteus maximus muscle: it forms the posterior lateral boundary of the perineum, and is situated external and posterior to the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament. The lesser sacro-sciatic ligament arises, internal and ante- rior to the greater, from the edge and anterior surface of the sacrum and edge of the os coccygis, where it is broad and expanded ; runs horizontally forwards and outwards, and terminates in a point, which is implanted into the spinous process of the ischium. The great sacro-sciatic ligament converts the sciatic notch into a large foramen, which is divided into a greater and lesser by the lesser sacro-sciatic ligament; the smaller of these gives egress to the tendon of the obturator internus muscle, ingress to the pudic vessels and nerves; the greater foramen gives exit to the pyriformis muscle, the gluteal artery, and superior gluteal nerve, the greater and lesser sciatic nerves, the sciatic and pudic arteries ; the first two pass out above the muscle, the remainder below it; the smaller sciatic foramen gives passage to the tendon of the obturator internus, the pudic artery, vein, and nerve. These ligaments, besides connecting the bones together, serve the important office of closing up the inferior aperture of the pelvis, and thus assist in supporting the weight of the pelvic viscera. The ossa pubis are united by a fibro-cartilaginous struc- ture, termed the synqjhysis pubis; this more properly consists of two portions, one of which belongs to each os pubis; they are of an oval shape, thin posteriorly, thick anteriorly ; they are dense and elastic, and are composed of fibres, taking different directions, some transverse, others concentric; in some subjects, particularlv in the female, a synovial membrane has been described as'existing between these cartilages near their posterior surface; it is said to be lubricated with a little fluid, and to allow of slight motion. This articulation is strengthened in front and

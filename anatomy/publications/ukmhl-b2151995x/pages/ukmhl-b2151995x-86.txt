70 ANATOMY. from the ulna. It articulates with three bones: the os lunare, the os unciforme, and the os pisiforme, and the fibro-cartilage already mentioned. No muscle is attached ^'^The OS pisiforme is the smallest of the carpal bones, and is situated on the anterior surface of the last-described bone It possesses but one articular surface, which is placed on its posterior part, and articulates with the cuneiform bone; anteriorly it gives attachment to the anterior annular ligament, and in the rest of its extent to ligaments connecting it to the metacarpal bone of the titth finger and unciform bone. It articulates with but one bone, the cuneiform. Muscles attached to the Pisiform Bone: Flexor carpi ulnaris. Abductor minimi digiti. The OS trapezium is placed between the scaphoid above, the first and second metacarpal bones be ow, and the trapezoides internally. It has three articular and three non-articular surfaces; the external non-articular surfac gives attachment to the external lateral ligament of the wrist-ioint; the anterior surface is marked by a deep groove directed forwards and outwards, which gives passage to the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, and into the edge of which is implanted the anterior annular ligament rticulates with'four bones, the scaphoid the firs metacarpal bone, the second metacarpal bone, and the trapezoides. , ^ m Muscles attached to the Os Trapezium : Extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis. Abductor pollicis. Opponens » Flexor brevis „ The OS trapezoides is the smallest bone of the second row and is placed between the scaphoid, the os trapezium Jhlos niagfium, and the second metacarpal bone; it is somewhat of a wedge shape, expanded towards the dorsum Sntracted towards the palm of the 1^-d; it has fou ovfiPiilar and two non-articular surfaces. It articulates with four bones: the scaphoid, the second metacarpal bone, the os magnum, and the trapezium.

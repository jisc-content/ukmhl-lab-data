THE HUMERUS. 63 femur. The groove which separates them is called the bicipital groove, because in it is lodged the long tendon of the biceps ; it is bounded on either side by two ridges, termed the inner or posterior, the outer or anterior edges of the bicipital groove, which give attachment to muscles. Immediately below the tuberosities the humerus becomes contracted, and becomes the shaft of the bone; this extends from the tuberosities to the inferior extremity; its upper third is round and strong, and has received the name of the surgical neck, as it is here that fracture so frequently takes place, to distinguish it from the anatomical neck already alluded to ; its middle third is irregularly twisted, and of a triangular shape ; its inferior becomes expanded and flattened anteriorly and posteriorly, and about the centre of the internal surface of the bone is the nutritious foramen directed downwards and outwards, surrounded by a rough surface, into which is implanted the coraco- brachialis muscle. The surfaces of the lower part of the humerus are separated by three ridges, an anterior, internal, and external. The inferior extremity of the humerus is turned forwards and inwards, becomes elongated trans- versely, flattened anteriorly and posteriorly, and terminates in forming the articular surfaces, for the reception of the radius and ulna; its anterior surface, which also looks inwards, is convex, and is marked inferiorly by the «?i^mor humeral fossa, which receives the coronoid process of the ulna m flexion of the elbow-joint; the posterior surface turned outwards is more extensive, concave, and marked by a deeper depression, the posterior humeral fossa which receives the olecranon in extreme extension of the joint; externally we observe a process, in which terminates the external ridge of the bone, termed the external condyle ; this IS placed on a plane, anterior to the internal condyle' and gives origin to the external lateral ligament of the elhow, and most of the extensors and supinators of the fore- arm ; as we pass from this internally, we meet with the capdulum, or lesser head of the humerus, a rounded convex, articular eminence, which is received into the cup- like cavity of the radius, and is bounded anteriorly bv a depression tor receiving the radius in flexion of the joint • internal to this is a depression for receiving the proj'cctiug lip of the same bone; still more internally, and separated

ARTERIA ULNAKIS. 350 cut between the supinator longus and pronator teres muscles which overlap the artery a little. As the musculo-spiral nerve' lies to the outer side of the artery in its middle third, the aneu rism needle should be passed from without inwards; elsewhere it IS a matter of indifference what direction is given to the instru ARTERIA "ULNARIS. From the division of the brachial the ulnar artery runs downwards and inwards along the ulnar side of the fore- arm passing in front of the wrist between the two portions of the annular hgaraent, enters the palm of the hand fI.H. ^'""'f^ integuments, and palma^ fascia obliquely forwards and outwards towards the meta carpal bone of the index-finger, where it termi.TateTby anastomosing with the superficiaJis vote and radialis in- dicis arteries. In the forearm the ulnar artery is deep but becomes superficial in the palm of the handf In the iayei ot the flexors and pronators, namely, the pronator teres, flexor carpi radiahs, palmaris longus, and the flew drgitorum subhmis; in the two lower thirds, it is overed only by the integuments, the fascia of the forearm and [he tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris. At first the ulnar artery rests on the brachialis anticus but throughout the rest of the forearm on the flexor Z ' torum .profundus.

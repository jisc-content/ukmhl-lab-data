Scarpa considers it to be a prolongation of the fascia ,.hich has received his name, or in other terms the deepest layer of the superficial fascia. It is so intimately connected with all these structures, that it is impossible to assign to it any distinct origin. It forms the third covering of an inguinal hernia, whether oblique or direct. , , ^. , On dissecting off this fascia, the external ab do mind ring is exposed. This is an opening m the externd oblique tendon, formed by the divergence of its descend^ fibres; it transmits the spermatic cord m the male, the round Ugament in the female. It is triangular in shape; Z^apA directed upwards and outwards, is rounded off by the intercolumnar bands; its 6a.e inferiorly is formed by the crest of the pubes; its mfernaZ margin, the West is formed by the internal piUar of the ring; its Sw rnar^n by the external pillar; its greatest length CO responds to thlt of its internal margin, and varies from one S to one inch and a half; it is the -t-or antmor opening of the inguinal or spermatic canal; through it an inS hernia emerges, to descend into the scrotum. Tf the spermatic cord be now cut across, a htt e beneath the ring and gently raised, it will be seen that it has escaped\?ough this aperture, resting, not on the bone butTrTon the external pillar of the ring, and that, behind the exTe^na abdominal ring, some fibrous structures exis , iMch assist in preventing the protrusion of^er^J^^^^^^^^ this onenino-. directly from behind, or, m other words, preven? re'formation of a direct inguinal hernia: these are Colleds fascia, and the conjoined tendmis CoUes's fascia, more commonly named the tnangular liaaZnt o/ZZkol hernia, is liable to much variety, bemg ^ome sfb els well marked jn others altogethei-^-^^^^^^^^ it lies behind the external abdominal ring n ^^^^l^^^^^ conjoined tendons, and P'^rtially concealed by he intona^ pillar of the ring.

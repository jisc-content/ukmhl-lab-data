SURGERY. 714 Calculi. 2. Uric acid, or lithic acid, (most common.) External Character. Chemical Qualities. Colour, brownish-red, fawn, or mahogany. Surface smooth, some- times tuberculated. Structure, in concen- tric lamellas ofacrys- talline texture; has sometimes an earthy appearance. Decomposedbeforethe blowpipe, giving out a strong odour, and leaving only a little grey ash. Soluble in liquor potassae, from which it may be precipitated by acetic acid, in the form of a white pow- der. Heated with nitric acid on a glass it is decomposed, and by evaporation leaves a substance of a beautiful pink colour. 3. Oxalate of lime. Mulberry calculus. Colour, dark brown. Surface, uneven, tu- berculated. Structure, imperfectly lamellated, hard, and compact. When re- moved not likely to reappear. Before the blowpipe is decomposed, the ox- alic acid passing off and the limeremain- ing. Soluble in hy- drocliloricacid,from which the lime may be subsequently pre- cipitated by ammo- nia. 4. Phosphate of lime. Colour, pale brown. Surface, smooth and polished. Structure, irregularly laminated; lamina; rarely separate. Before the blowpipe infusible; soluble in hydrochloric acid, from which it is thrown down by ammonia. 5. Ammonio-mag sian phosphate. I- Colour, nearly white. Surface, uneven, often covered with small crystals. Texture, not lamella- ted. Fracture, irregular, earthy appearance, rarely crystaUine. Shape, oval. Liable to reappear. Before the blowpipe gives off ammonia, and fuses with diffi- culty ; when potash is added to it am- monia is evolved. It is soluble in dilute acids.

222 ANATOMY. it belongs rather to the fibro-cartilaginous tissue, known by the French as tissujaune. It adheres inferiorly to the interior part of the thyroid cartilage by a strong elastic ligamentous substance. It is somewhat OTal, or is likened to an obcordate leaf, rather convex above, concave below, covered by mucous membrane, and studded with numerous mucous foUicles. It is kept in its situation also by ligaments, extending from the base of the tongue, and Hkewise by two ligaments which proceed from its sides to the arytenoid cartilages. Between the epiglottis and the dorsum of the tongue is found a small mass of fatty substance, incorrectly called the epiglottic gland. The ligaments of the larynx are by some considered to be seventeen in number. They are, three broad, four capsular, two round, four thyro-arytenoid, and four con- nected with the epiglottis. The broad ligaments are— The thyro-hyoid, connecting the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage with the internal surface of the os hyoides. It is also named thyro-hyoid membrane. The crico-thyroid, through which the operation of laryngo- tomy is performed. The hgamentous substance between the cricoid cartilage and the first ring of the trachea. The capsular ligaments are four. They are on each side. Crico-arytenoid, Crico-thyroid. The two round ligaments extend from the superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage to the extremity of the great cornu of the OS hyoides on each side. The thyro-arytenoid ligaments are superior and inferior on each side. The inferior only are really ligamentous; and form the true chordae vocales; they pass from the base of the arytenoid cartilages to the inside of the angle of the thyroid. Tlie superior, so-styled ligaments, are folds of mucous membrane, passing from near the apex of the arytenoid cartilages to the same point as the former. Between the two, on each side, is a fossa, named sacculus larync/is, or ventricle of Galen. The four ligaments of the epiglottis are—

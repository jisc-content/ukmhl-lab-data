Immediately beneath and intimately connected with the cutis vera is found, in some animals, a peculiar muscular structure, called the panniculus carnosus. The rete mucosum is now considered to be simply tue innermost soft layer of the cuticle or epidermis. It is accurately moulded to the cutis, the inequalities of which Impartially diminishes, being thicker between the papiU^ and thinner on their summits. It is composed of minute nuclea cells, which are oval in shape, and become flat- tened into scales when forming tlie cuticle.

48 ANATOMY. Its two heads are separated by the vessels passing to the head of the bone, branches of the obturator and internal circumflex arteries, the conduction and protection of which seem to be its principal use. The cotyloid ligament surrounds the brim of the ace- tabulum to which it is firmly attached ; it is deeper at the upper and back part of th& acetabulum than elsewhere: its structure is fibro-cartilaginous, its fibres running obliquely towards the bone; it is continuous with the tendon of the rectus femoris muscle, and is hued by synovial membrane ; its use is to deepen the cavity of the acetabulum without interfering with the motion of the ^Â°^A^'few fibres pass in a transverse direction, across the notch beneath the cotyloid ligament, which have received the name of transverse ligament, they are seldom so distinct as to deserve a separate name; they are intimately connected with the cotyloid hgament. The interior of the hip-joint is hned by a synovial membrane, which covers the head of the bone, part of its neck lines the capsular ligament, and is reflected upon the round ligament. Like similar membranes it forms a shut The hip-joint belongs to the class of Enarthrodial, or ball-and-cup articulations; its motions are very extensive, and comprise Jiexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation and circumduction. THE KNEE-JOINT. The knee-joint is formed hy three bones: the femur above, the tibia beneath, and the 2->ateUa m front. The femur presents for the purpose two oval convex eminences, termed condyles, elongated in the antero- nosterior direction, and incrusted with cartilage. _ The superior extremity of the tibia which assists m forming the joint is of an oval shape, elongated trans- versely and is marked with two concave articular surfaces, for the reception of the condyles of the femur, and cor- responds with them; they are also termed internal and external condyles. ^- w The part of the patella which enters into this articulation is its posterior surface ; this is triangular in shape; the

THE BRAIN. J47 face of each hemisphere are seen convex ridges rimnino- iu various directions, named^yn', or conyolutions, the fissures between them being called sulci, or grooves. The gyri, or convolutions of one side, have but a general resemblance in figure to those of the other. The difference in appearance is more marked as the brain is better de- veloped, and is more apparent in man than in the inferior animals, rhere is one convolution more uniform than the rest to which the term gyrus fomicatus is appUed.

REGIONAL AND SUllGICAL ANATOMY. 314 ramus of the lower jaw and the internal lateral ligament. In the second stage it ascends forwards and inwards, passing through a triangular space bounded above by the external pterygoid muscle, below by the internal ptery- goid, its apex being at the origin of these muscles, its base directed outwards at the ramus of the jaw, whence it winds over the external pterygoid muscle, lies between it and the temporal muscle, and arrives at the back part of the orbit; it then descends and completes its third stage in the pterygo-maxillary fossa. The branches of the internal maxillary artery are thirteen in number; viz. Ramus tympanicus, Ramus meningeus parvus, Arteria meningea media, Maxillaris inferior, Plerygoidem, Temporales profunda, Massetericas, ' Buccales, Maxillaris superior, Infraorbitalis, Palatina descendens, Vidiana, Nasalis. In the first stage it gives ofi" the three following: Bamus tympanicus. This small vessel runs backwards, and passes through the fissura glaseri into the tympanum, where it anastomoses with the branches of the stylo- mastoid artery, given ofi" from the posterior aural. Arteria meningea media is the largest branch of the internal maxillary, from the superior part of which it arises. It thence ascends towards the cranium between the internal lateral ligament and the tensor palati, giving off branches to the surrounding structures, and passing through the spinous foramen of the sphenoid bone, enters the cavitv of the cranium : it here lies between the bone and dura' mater, in a groove in the former, sometimes for a part of its course in a complete bony canal, and closely connected to the latter. It first crosses the squamous portion of the temporal bone, then the anterior inferior angle of the parietal, and thence ascends, parallel and a little posterior to the coronal suture, to the verte.x, where it is lost in numerous branches, which t-re variously dis-

INJURIES OF THR HEAD. 4g3 Wounds of the scalp comprise the simple incised, con- tused, lacerated, and punctured. Simple incised wounds of the scalp are treated as in other regions of the body, the part having been previously shaved, the edges of the wound are brought together and retained in apposition by means of adhesive plaster and sutures There is frequently some difficulty in restraining haemorrhage from wounds of the scalp, from the retraction of the mouths of the blood-vessels. Pressure, by means of compresses, held for some time over the course of the artery, wUl be often found sufficient; should this not suc- ceed, the vessels must be secured with the ligature The use of sutures in the scalp is, in the opinion of some very objectionable, as they are productive of irritation, and may induce erysipelas, but this may generally be avoided It the sutures are removed at the end of twenty-four hours Contused wounds of the scalp are in general accom- panied with a certain degree of laceration; we shall there- fore consider tliem under the head of contused and lace- rated wounds. These injuries are produced by blows of some b unt instrument on the head, or by the passa-e of a wheel across part of the skuU; in 'this wly CuStly happens that a large portion of the scalp is sepTraJed the head The exposed parts should be cleared of all foreign bodies, such as dirt, gravel, &c., and the flao immediate y replaced in situ, being held so by strips of adhesive plaster, with one or two points of sutui, these should be found necessary. A bandage is now to be apphed and the head kept cool by the use of cold evano rating lotions. The antiphlogistic regimen is to bl ?! Tu^ VhT^r ^y^vZrji^,;^ ensue.

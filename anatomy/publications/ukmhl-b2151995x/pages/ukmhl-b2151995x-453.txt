THE BLOOD. 437 aorta into the capillary system, to be again returned by the veins. The aorta and pulmonary artery are each guarded by three semilunar or sigmoid valves, which prevent the blood returning into the ventricles. Foetal Circulation.—The circulation of blood in the fcetus is considered now to be carried on in the following manner: the blood, purified in the placenta, is carried to the fcetus by the umbihcal vein, which, running along the longitudinal fissure of the liver, gives branches to each lobe of it, and its continuous branch passes to the inferior vena cava, under the name of the ductus venoms: next, the blood of the in- ferior cava enters the right auricle of the heart, and is directed by the Eustachian valve through the foramen ovale into the left auricle, from which it passes into the left ventricle, and thence into the ascending aorta. Neariy all this blood goes to the head and upper extremities, from which parts it returns to the heart by the superior cava, and enters the right auricle, in which, separated by the Eustachian valve from the lower current, it passes on to the right ventricle, and thence into the pulmonary artery, which, in the fcetus, has three branches, the two pidmonary arteries, as yet very small, and a third large trunk, named ductus arteriosus, leading into the lower part of the arch of the aorta. Most of the blood then received by the pulmonary artery passes into the aorta, very httle into the lungs; and the blood thus received by the aorta descends to supply the lower parts of the bodv, a large portion of it finding Its way into the umbiUcal arteries (then verylaro-e) to be carried back to the placenta to be purified. ^ This kind of circulation is highly probable, when we take into consideration the superior development of the head and upper extremities, the situation of the Eustachian valve, and the pecuhar direction in which the ductus arteriosus enters the aorta: this is the description which IS now more generally received. The temperature of the blood is about 98°. The cause of It IS not perfectly agreed upon. Some attribute it to the caloric evolved in the lungs, arising from the union ol" oxygen with carbon and say that it is carried by meZs of the blood to the difi^srent parts of the body; olhers more rationally consider that caloric is evolved in the ceiTeral capillanes at the time of the conversion of the arteriaTrto

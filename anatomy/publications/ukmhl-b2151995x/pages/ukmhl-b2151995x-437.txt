COMPOSITION OF SEOKETIONS AND EXCRETIONS. 421 heat. The bones of the adult, however, are much richer in earthy matter than those of the child, some bones of the body containing also more earthy substance than others. The analysis of bone, by Berzelius, yields— Phosphate of Lime, with a little Fluoride of Calcium 53*04 Carbonate of Lime . . . . 11-30 Phosphate of Magnesia . . .1-16 Salts of Soda .... 1-20 Gelatine (soluble in water) . . . 32*17 Vessels, &;c. .... 1-13 100- The Teeth, though very similar in composition, do not contain so much animal matter; the enamel of the teeth is almost exclusively formed by the salts of lime, the animal portion not constituting 5 per cent. Muscle is composed chiefly of fibrine, with gelatine, osmazome, albumen, neutral salts of soda, lime, and ammonia, and some nervous matter and blood. ' • The brain and nervous matter consist of water, white fatty matter, albumen, osmazome, phosphorus, salts' acids, and sulphur. Two new fatty acids have recently been discovered in the brain, Viz.,—cerebric and oleophosfhoric, the composition of which is as yet but very imperfectly known. ^ Tendons are composed almost exclusively of gelatine. Ligaments and membranes are composed chiefly of coagulated albumen and gelatine. Most of the cartilages of the body contain gelatine, but in those of the ribs and joints it is replaced by an analogous, though slightly diff-erent substance, called chondrine. The 7iails are composed of coagulated albumen, gelatine salts earthy matter, and a very sma^l quantity of water ' The humours of the eye consist of water, albumen animal matter, resembling gelatine, and several neutral DESCllirTION OF THE STRUCTURE OP THE TISSUES. Every part of the animal body may be considered as developed from cells ; these cell., by a variety of changes,

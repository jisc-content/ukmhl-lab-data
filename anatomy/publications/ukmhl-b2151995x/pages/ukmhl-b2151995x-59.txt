THE METATARSDS. 43 towards the sole of the foot. By cartilaginous surfaces it articulates with six bones : anteriorly, with the third metatarsal bone. internally, with the second metatarsal and middle cuneiform bones. posteriorly, with the navicular bone. externally, with the cuboid, and more anteriorly with the fourth metatarsal bone. The muscles attached are : Flexor brevis pollicis. Adductor pollicis. The tarsal bones are composed of spongy tissue, with a layer of compact matter on their surface. They are developed from one point of ossification, excepting the OS calcis, which has two; and at birth they are almost entirely cartilaginous. The Metatarsus consists of five bones, which belong to the class of long bones, each consisting of a posterior or tarsal extremity and an anterior or phalangeal, which is also named the head. The upper extremity presents a smooth surface, for articulation with the bones of the tarsus; the head is rounded, with its long axis downwards, and just behind this is a prominent ridge, but separated from the smooth surface of the head by a groove; the bodies are flattened laterally, for the lodgment of the interossei muscles. The 1st metatarsal bone is the shortest and strongest; its posterior articulating surface, in shape, somewhat re- sembles the human ear. It presents a tubercle inferiorly and externally, for the attachment of the peroneus longus ; its anterior extremity is quadrangular, and marked in- feriorly by two grooves, which give lodgment to the two sesamoid bones. It is articulated with five bones, viz.: internal cuneiform, second metatarsal, the first phalanx, two sesamoid bones. The 2d metatarsal bone is the longest, and at its poste- rior part 18 wedged in between the cuneiform bones. It articulates with six bones, viz.: the three cuneiform bones, first and third metatarsal, first phalanx of the second toe.

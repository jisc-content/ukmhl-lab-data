18 ANATOMY. senting a sharp ridge, directed obliquely downwards and outwards for the insertion of the sacro-lumbalis muscle; the angle is wanting in the first and twelfth ribs, and but badly marked in the second and eleventh; the mner surface of the rib is concave, directed downwards and inwards; the uppe?' edge is rounded off, is directed a Uttle inwards, and gives insertion to the intercostal muscles; its inferior edge, turned outwards, is sharp and grooved internally for the intercostal artery, and gives origin to the intercostal muscles; its anterior extremity is hollowed out for the recep- tion of the costal cartilage. The first, second, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, present peculiarities which must be considered. The/?-s^ rib is much shorter than any of the rest; it is broad, thin, and flat, placed nearly horizontally, and is regularly curved, so as to form nearly a semi-circle, and to allow its extremities to rest, at the same time, on a horizontal plane; its head is not divided into two articular surfaces, but articulates with a whole surface on the body of the first vertebra ; the neck is of considerable length ; i't wants the angle; its surfaces are du-ected upwards and downwards, the superior of which presents two depressions corresponding to the subclavian artery and vein, separated by a ridge into which is implanted the scalenus anticus muscle: its upper, or rather inner edge, does not give attachment to the intercostal muscles. The second rib somewhat resembles the first; it is, how- ever, longer, and is intermediate in pecuharities between the first and the succeeding ribs. The eleventh and twelfth, called also the floating ribs, are short and thin ; the head presents a whole articulating surface for the body of the corresponding vertebra ; they want the tubercles, as they do not articulate with the transverse processes; the angle is badly marked in the eleventh, completely deficient in the twelfth ; their anterior extremities, thin and pointed, are in general tipped with cartilage. The lower edge of the last rib gives attachment to some of the abdominal muscles, but not to the inter- costals. The tenth rib occasionally resembles the eleventh and twelfth, in being articulated with but one vertebra, and not articulating with the transverse process. The ribs are developed and ossified early in foetal hfe, in

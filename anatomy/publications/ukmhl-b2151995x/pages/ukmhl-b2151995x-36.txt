20 ANATOMY. At birth, the sternum usually consists of five pieces of bone, which are united by cartilage until puberty, when bony union commences between the four lower' pieces. The upper portion is united to the rest by cartilage for many years, but in old age is united by bone. The ensiform cartilage begins to be ossified after puberty; but a part may remain cartilaginous even in old age. The Costal Cartilages complete the thorax anteriorly; they are twelve in number on each side; of these the seven superior only are directly connected with the sternum, the three succeeding are connected with the cartilage of the last true rib, and with one another, whilst the last two are suspended in the abdominal muscles ; they increase in length from the first, which is short, to the seventh or eighth, and then decrease to the last, of which the cartilage is seldom more than half an inch in length; the two extremilies are convex, the external one is received into a depression in the anterior extremity of the rib, to which it is immovably connected; the internal is at- tached, in the true ribs, to the concave surfaces already described on the edges of the sternum, where a ball-and- socket joint is formed, lined by synovial membrane, and possessing considerable motion in the young subject; the cartilages of the three superior false ribs are continuous with one another and with the cartilage of the last true rib, and occasionally present on their edges (when they are in contact with each other) small articulating surfaces; those of the floating ribs are separated from the rest, and are lost in the abdominal muscles. The cartilage of the first rib is exceedingly sho7-t, and is remarkable for being more intimately connected with the sternum than the rest, having no intervening synovial membrane, and for being continuous with the inter-articular cartilage of the stej-no- clavicular articulation ; the second is remarkable for being identified at its anterior extremity with the cartilaginous structure already described as connecting the two pieces of the sternum, with each of which it is articulated, and is thus said to have two synovial membranes. The cartilages of the ribs are frequently ossified, not only in the old sub- ject, but even in the young, particularly in the phthisical individual; their structure then resembles that of the ribs. They are most liable to ossification in the male.

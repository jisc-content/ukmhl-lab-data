ABDOMINAL AORTA. 259 the small omentum, and at the pylorus anastomoses with the pyloric arteries. The splenic artery, rather tortuous, and largest of the three branches in the adult, runs horizontally towards the spleen, resting upon the upper edge of the pancreas, in which it is occasionally somewhat imbedded; in its course it gives off some small branches to the pancreas, named pancreaticce parvcB, and one larger, which, entering the pancreas, runs from left to right with the pancreatic duct, and is named pancreatica magna; near the spleen It gives off a large branch to the stomach {gastro-epiploica sinistra), which runs along the great curvature, and anas- tomoses with a similar vessel from the right; it then divides into five or six branches, which generally give off some ramuli to the great end of the stomach (vasa breviu) and then enter the spleen, to ramify in it. The hepatic artery, largest in the foetus, is next in size to the splenic in the adult. It inclines a little forwards upwards, and to the right, to reach the transverse fissure branches '° its. course gives off the following 1st. The pylonca superior, a small irregular branch which passes up behind the pylorus, and anastomoses with tlie coronaria ventriculi. 2d. The gastro-duodenalis, a very large branch, almost equal in size to the continued hepatic trunk : this first gives off a small branch {pylorica inferior), which is dis- tnbuted, as its name implies, but is irregular in its origin llie vessel then appears to divide into two trunks viz ' pancreatico-duodenalis and gastro-epiploica dextra. The pancreatico-duodenalis runs in the groove between the Head ot the pancreas and the inner margin of the duode- num, in Its course supplying branches to both, and termi- nates by anastomosing with a branch of tlie superior mesenteric artery. The gastro-epiploica dextra runs along the great curvature of the stomach from k\2Z left, supplying that viscus and the great omentum with branches, and anastomoses freelv Mith thpVnTH.! , • sinistra and tlie coronaria ventriculi S^^^^'^-^P^Plo^ca ^t^^:^^ ^ansverse fissure of which divide and subdiv^f in'u^J^i;^ t^l'e:!

INJURIES OP THE THORAX. 511 sema of the lungs, as -well as emphysema corporis appears, as the air escapes from the wound of the lung into the cavity of the chest, and is thence expelled by means of the wound in the thoracic parietes into the general cellular tissue of the body. The air may also pass directly from the wounded air-cells into the interlobular cellular tissue. The treatment of this accident consists in placing a broad bandage round the thorax, so as to fix the rib^, especially the broken ones, in order that they may be prevented from doing further injury to the lung, and be aUowed to unite, inspiration being carried on solely by the diaphragm, and in the free abstraction of blood, to lessen the quantity circulating in the lungs, and prevent the supervention of inflammation. The operation of paracentesis thoracis, or tapping the thorax, is very seldom resorted to for the purpose of ab- stractmg the air from the cavity of the chest, as the most dangerous symptoms are not produced from its presence in this situation, even although it should be in such quan- tity as to compress the lung on that side; but a few cases have been recorded where the air pent up in one pleura pressed against the heart and lung of the healthy side so as to threaten suflFocation; and in which case a puncture of the affected side allowed some air to escape and gave immediate relief. The only cases in which this operation is at present resorted to are empyema, where a collection of matter has formed in the chest, and some cases of hydro-thorax. It is performed as follows: Place the patient in the sitting posture, with the arms folded across the chest|; examine if the matter point at anv particular part if It should the opening is to he made here; if not, the inteml between the fifth and sixth ribs, or between the sixth and sevS should be selected: the former is best on the right side, k con sequence of the contiguity of the liver; the latter is o be pre" ferred on the left, in order to avoid the heart and pericardium Draw up the mteguraent and make an incision liCJn^T-^' in length, a littl^ above and parallel to trupp^ Vd^ro/S lower nb, that the intercostal vessels mnv nnt k1 P , and passing through the sldnld ont r hver of fnt/ Tf """^ = cles, next divide the inner intercosX and the pleura, make a small opentt 'nto it lr?h^^ f^T"^ angle of the scapuIa.^^H^^r ^i^S^^^L^^;. /

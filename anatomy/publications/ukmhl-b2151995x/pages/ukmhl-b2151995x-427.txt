Physiology is generally considered to embrace the de- scription of the various vital functions of the parts com- posing the human body, as well as the more intimate structure of the parts themselves; the relations of these parts to each other being referred to descriptive anatomy, and their chemical composition to animal chemistry. Before commencing the description of the tissues which lorm the human body, it will be as well to mention briefly the more striking peculiarities of the organic substances, ot wliich these tissues are buUt up, and briefly describe the cliemical composition of each. The organic components of the human body may be divided into two kinds, one of which contains nitrogen and is therefore called azotised, the other containing no nitrogen, called non-azotised. The former class conipre- hends the more striking constituents of the body, the latter those substances only which are laid up for 'future con- sumption or secreted for present use. AZOTISED SUBSTANCES. Foremost among these must be placed the compounds ot a base called proteine. This substance, with a small quantity of phosphorus and sulphur, forming the three substances, of which a very large portion of the body is composed. The following table will show the composiUo oi proteine and its compounds, according to Mr. Fownes : Carbon. Hydrogen. Nitrogen. Oxygen. Sulphur.

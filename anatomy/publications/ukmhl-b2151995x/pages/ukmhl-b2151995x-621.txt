TREATMENT OF FRACTURES. 605 and retained so by means of bandages, compresses, and splints. Suppose, then, that we are treating a fracture of the centre of the femur in the extended position, and that coaptation has been effected. A mattress, or other re- sisting bed, is to be prepared, on which the patient is placed in the recumbent posture; indeed, it were better to place the patient on the bed previously to our having recourse to extension and counter-extension, as thus any danger of disturbing the fractured portions when once they have been placed in apposition, by moving him from one bed to the other, is avoided. A many-tailed bandage being wet with cold evaporating lotion, such as the lotio muriatis ammonia, or the lotio acetatis plumbi, or cold water, is to be passed beneath the thigh, and then carefully appUed round the hmb from below upwards, the ends of each bandage overlapped in front, and the lower bandage overlapped by that immediately above; the highest bandage IS, lastly, to be secured with pins. Compresses wet m the lotion are now to be applied so as to form a uniform surface for the pressure of the splints, and to protect the projecting eminences of the bones The sphnts, one on either side, one in front, and one along the back of the limb if thought necessary, are now to he applied, and secured by means of tapes passed around the hmb. The inner lateral splint should extend from the pudenda, the outer one from the crest of the iUum to a short distance below the foot, and be provided here with a foot-piece to which the foot is to be attached, so as to prevent the rotation of the leg, and the consequent dis- placement of the fracture. AU parts of the spl nts likelv to press on any portion of the hmb or trunk shodd te covered with portions of bandage, or the pressure btne off by means of compresses. ^ AZSt: ktriexed s'ts ^o' /'^ '^^''^ ^^^-^ angle with the th^h, o" tl g o^ndrtha?

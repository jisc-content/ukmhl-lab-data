REGIOKAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY, 380 nated, but elsewhere is loose and irregular; its external surface is identified with the deep surface of the integu- ments; its deep surface is loosely connected with the fascia lata, except in the groin, where it is firmly attached to the cribriform fascia. In the superficial fascia several arteries, veins, nerves, and glands, may be observed; the arteries are the external pudic, the superficial epigastric, and the externa circumflexa ilii; they arise from the femoral artery a little below Poupart's ligament, and soon penetrate the fascia lata to be distributed in the surrounding integu- ments. The external pudic are lost in the integument on the upper and inner part of the thigh, the scrotum, and penis; the superficial epigastric winds upwards over Poupart's ligament towards the umbilicus; the externa circumflexa ilii passes upwards and outwards towards the crest of the ilium; these branches, although small in the natural state, become frequently very much enlarged in diseases of the surrounding parts, and -will, if divided, require the ligature. The external pudic are in general wounded in the operation of castration, and the superficial epigastric in the operations for the relief of strangulated inguinal and femoral hernia. The veins met with in this region are the trunk and branches of the internal saphena vein ; this vessel commences at the inner side of the foot,^ ascends over the internal malleolus along the inner side ot the leg and knee into the inner and fore part of the thigh; it here continues its course upwards, turning slightly out- wards, and about one and a half or two inches below Poupart's ligament perforates the cribriform fascia to join the femoral vein; in this course the saphena vem receives several branches from the surrounding integuments; shortly before its termination two or more vessels ot considerable size, from the outer and fore part ot tbe thigh, empty themselves into it along with some of smaller size from the abdominal parietes and scrotum. In the several operations on the femoral artery, and in that for the relief of the strangulated femoral hernia, the saphena vein is much endangered, and should be avoided. This vem is liable to become varicose, particularly in the leg and foot, from its greai length and its superficial course beneath the skin where it unsupported by the fascia.

391 GLUTEAL REGION. two muscles. It is possible, also, that the anastomotica magna artery may be mistaken for the femoral; but this is not likely, unless that vessel has become more than usually enlarged. The muscles, with their origin and insertion, and also the nerves within the femoral region, having been de- scribed in another part of this work, we shall now proceed to describe THE GLUJTEAL REGION. This region is situated on the back and upper part of the thigh, bounded superiorly by the crest of the ilium, internally and posteriorly by the sacrum, coccyx, and perineum, anteriorly by a line drawn vertically down- wards, from the spine of the ilium, and inferiorly by the fold of the nates; it is covered by the gluteus maximus and medius muscles. On raising the integuments from this region, several small nerves will be exposed; they are branches of the lumbar and sacral plexuses and the sciatic nerve. Small arteries and veins are also met with, but they are of no practical importance. The superficial fascia covering this region is loaded generally with a large quantity of adipose tissue; on raising this the fascia lata is exposed. This is thin and weak posteriorly, where it covers the gluteus maximus, but is dense and strong anteriorly over the gluteus medius. On raising this, the muscles of this region may be examined : they are nine in number, viz.. Gluteus maximus. medius. minimus. Pyriformis. Gemellus superior. inferior. Obturator extemus. internus. Quadratus femoris. In disease of the hip-joint the gluteus maximus muscle becomes relaxed, and its surface is flattened, and the fold of the nates sinks lower than on the opposite side; these symptoms are not confined to morbus coxa:, l)ut will be met with in many other affections, more particularly in paralysis of the limb. A deep fossa exists in the living subject behind the trochanter major; here issues are most frequently inserted in the disease

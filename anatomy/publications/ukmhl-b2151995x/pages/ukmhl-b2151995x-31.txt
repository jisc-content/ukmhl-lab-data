15 MUSCLES ATTACHED TO THE SPINE. and lateral aspects, the following particulars may be noticed, separating however the atlas from consideration. Anteriorly, it presents on a cursory view a pyramidal form, but if examined more closely it appears to consist of three pyramids : The first extending from the second to the seventh cervical vertebra. The second is inverted and extends from the seventh cervical to the fourth or fifth dorsal. The third extends from the fourth or fifth dorsal to the last lumbar vertebra or the sacrum. In this aspect the spine is not quite straight, being generally a little inclined to the right side, in consequence of the more frequent use of the right arm. Posteriorly, the spine presents the spinous processes, almost horizontal in the cervical and lumbar regions, and overlapping each other almost perpendicularly in the dorsal region : on each side of these there is a deep groove, which decreases in breadth but increases in depth, from above downwards, to give lodgment to the various muscles. The spine, viewed laterally, presents an undulating line, convex in the cervical and lumbar portions, concave in the dorsal; along it we see the intervertebral foramina, anterior to the transverse processes in the back and loins, and between them in the cervical region. The motions of the spine are fiexion, extension, lateral motion, slight circumduction, and rotatio7i. The spine of the fcetus presents a single inverted pyramid, and possesses but one curve, which is concave forwards : the spine of very old persons is curved like that of the fcetus, but the elastic structures have lost much of their elasticity, and are often converted into bone. The muscles attached to the spine are symmetrical, and consist of anterior and posterior. Those attached ante- riorly, and in part laterally, are the following :— Rectus capitis antictcs major. I) ,) minor. „ lateralis. Longus colli. Scalenus anticus, ,, medius. 1) jwsticus. Diaphragma. Quadratus lumhorum.

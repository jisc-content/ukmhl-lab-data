Fungous growth from the dura mater, or substance of the brain, should be carefully distinguished from a hernia or protrusion of the cerebral substance. DISEASES OF THE EYELIDS. The principal diseases of the lids are entropium and ectropium. They are also subject to the formation of tumours, to abscesses, tinea ciliaris, hordeolum, lagoph- thalmia, and ptosis. Entropium (Trichiasis) is an inverted state of the eye- lashes and tarsal cartilage, most frequently of the upper hd, whereby the former are forced against and irritate the conjunctiva, so as to induce chronic inflammation of it, and frequently destruction of vision. This disease is almost always preceded by inflammatiou of the conjunc- tiva, which, causing the disease at first, is subsequently aggravated by its continuance. It may be caused also by the presence of tumours in the lid, the cicatrices of ulcers burns &c. In the early stages, the hairs only are mis- placed, but in the more advanced, the tarsal cartilage becomes curved, and adds to the patient's suflfering If seen at an early period, the disease may be removed by the use of leeches, moderately astringent lotions, and the ex- tracting of the displaced eyelashes. When more advanced It wU be necessary to have recourse to an operation, to remedy the curved state of the cartilage. Scarpa recom- mends tor the purpose the removal of a fold of the integuments of the lid, in the following manner : Pinch up a fold of the skin in the transverse direction with a forceps, or between the finger and thumb, and remove li wl a probe-pomted sharp curved scissors, taking care that one bTadl of the scissors is placed near the edge of the cartilaije so K his may be acted upon more completely, in the ciSLtinn J the wound. The edges of the wound are to be bro2t f h °^ by suture and adhesive plaster.

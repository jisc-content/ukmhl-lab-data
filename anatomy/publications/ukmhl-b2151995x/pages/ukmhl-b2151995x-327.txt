PAROTID REGION. 311 wards, the portio dura nerve is first brought into view. This nerve escapes from the stylo-mastoid foramen, gives oflf a few branches to the stylo-hyoid and digastric muscles, and immediately after enters the posterior and deep surface of the gland, which it traverses in a direction forwards and outwards, and escapes from its anterior margin on the masseter muscle, and is lost on the integuments and muscles on the side of the temple, face, and neck. In the substance of the parotid gland, the portio dura presents a remarkable appearance, the pes anserinus, formed by its division into two trunks, the temporo-facial, and the cervico-facial, and the subdivision of these into numerous branches, some of which ascend, others pass transversely whilst others descend. The pes anserinus lies superficial to the external jugular vein and external carotid artery and IS separated from them by a small portion of the gland. '■ . By removing a little more of the gland, the external jugular vein and the external carotid artery will be exposed the former lying superficial to, but in close contact with tne latter. The external jugular vein is formed in the substance of the parotid gland, by the junction of the internal maxillary and temporal veins, from thence it descends in the neck and terminates in the subclavian vein. The external carotid artery lies in the parotid gland, beneath the portio dura and external jugular vein- it here gives oli its last branches, viz., the transversalis faciei, the temporal and internal maxillary arteries : the last two are more particularly its terminating branches, and arise opposite a point nearly midway between the zygoma and the angle of the lower jaw, but a little nearer the former ande ortl.f''"''"''''^''' ^""'"S ^ ^"^^ «bove the angle of the jaw runs upwards and forwards through the gland escapes from its anterior margin, crosses e masseter muscle, parallel to and above tlie pai-o id di^t accompanied by filaments of the portio durf and nartlv

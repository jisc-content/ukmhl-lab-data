264 ANATOMY. through which an interval is found between them, m which are lorlged the dorsal veins of the penis: they are continuous with the lateral ligaments. By the true liga- ments the inferior fundus of the bladder is kept in situ, and prevented from rising out of the pelvis ; they separate the cavity of the pelvis from the perineum, and thus pre- vent the diseases of either of those parts from passing freely into the other. , p ^ ^ In structure, the bladder is composed of four coats: 1st, the serous or peritoneal; 2d, the muscular; 3d, the cellular ; and 4th, the raucous. The serous is but a partial coat it covers the superior fundus, as far forwards as the urachus, the whole of the posterior surface, the lateral surfaces as far as on a line with the posterior extremities of the vesicula; seminales, and the inferior fundus to within about three quarters of an inch of the base of the prostate gland The muscular fibres are of a reddish colour, and consist of three sets: 1st, the longitudinal; these extend from the anterior true ligaments upwards, on the anterior surface of the bladder, expanding towards the urachus, they thence descend along the posterior surface and inferior fundus to the base of the prostate gland in the male ; they are sometimes named the detrusor urinse muscle ; 2d, the oblique fibres; these are indistinct, and scattered on the lateral surfaces of the bladder; 3d, the circular fibres; these are best marked round the cervix, where they appear to form a sphincter muscle, beneath the mucous membrane. There are intervals between the muscular fibres of the bladder, through which the mucous membrane sometmies become^ protruded, so as to form sacculi or pouches, in which calculi are not unfrequently odged. The cellular coat of the bladder, if it deserves the name, is composed of submucous cellular tissue, containing numerous twisted fibres of elastic tissue, is strong, and of a whitish appearance. The mucous membrane is of a pinkish colour, {pale straw colour, according to Mr. Guthrie,) and presents irregular patches of vascularity, distinct from inflammation ; it is thrown into rugfe or folds, in the contracted state ot the organ, but these rugae arc only occasioned by the projection of some of the muscular fasciculi. immediately behind the orifice of the urethra there is a triangular pordoa of the bladder, where the mucous mem-

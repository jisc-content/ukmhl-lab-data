It is soluble in hot -water, becoming more solid in cooling. It becomes brittle -when the water is expelled, as in glue. It is in- soluble in alcohol, miscible with or soluble in weak acids and alkalies, has a weak afiinity for metallic oxides, and forms a dense precipitate with tannic acid, called tanno- gelatine, the base of leather. Its composition per cent, is— Carbon .... 50-05 Hydrogen . . • 6-07 Nitrogen . . . .18-35 Oxygen .... 25-13 100- from which it has been considered to be formed by— Carbon, 13; Hydrogen, 10; Nitrogen, 2 ; Oxygen, 5 ; it will thus be seen to have no relation with the proteine compounds. Chondrine differs but little in its properties and compo- sition from gelatine, but is distinguished from it by giving a precipitate with oxide of lead. It is found in the carti- lages of the ribs and joints. Its formula is— Carbon, 16; Hydrogen, 13; Nitrogen, 4; Oxygen, 7. Urea, a substance found in considerable quantity in the urine, is colourless and transparent, with a very faint smell and cool saline taste, very soluble in water, less so in alcohol, has no action on htmus or turmeric paper, and by heat is decomposed and resolved into carbonate of ammonia. It is the medium by which the excretion of nitrogen from the system takes place. Its composition is found'to be— Carbon, 2; Hydrogen, 4 ; Nitrogen, 2 ; Oxygen, 2.

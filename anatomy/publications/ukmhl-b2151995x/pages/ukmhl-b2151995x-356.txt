It bends outwards, in front of "the scalenus anticus and phrenic nerve, crosses the apex ot the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, runs between the b anche of the brachial plelus, and enters the posterior superior triangle, where it terminates by dividing into two branches, the cervicalis superficialis, and the scapularis posterior.

SURGERY. 658 blows -without the spine being injured. The symptoms are the same as those described as resulting from laceration or pressure on the spinal marrow. The operation of removing the displaced portions of the vertebrae, in fractures of the spine, has been performed, but as yet without success. The treatment to be adopted consists in the local abstraction of blood by cupping or leeches, the opening of the bowels by means of purgative medicines or enemata, and the drawing the urine by the catheter. Ulceration of the mucous membrane of the bladder and sloughing of the nates are frequent results of injuries of the spine. Concussion of the spinal marrow should be treated anti- phlogistically, and calomel be administered as rapidly as possible, so as to prevent the disorganisation of the spinal marrow, and cause the absorption of any fluids that may have been eflfused. ON COMPOUND DISLOCATIONS. When a joint is dislocated, and a wound communi- cating with the articulation has been at the same time inflicted, the accident is called a compound dislocation. Compound dislocations of the large joints are usually fatal, or require amputation. When the smaller joints are afi"ected, as the anlde, elbow, &c., the displaced bones should be reduced if possible, and the external wound closed. When this cannot be effected, the wound should be dilated ; and if this does not succeed, the end of the replaced bone should be sawn off", and the parts replaced. In gunshot wounds of the articulations, the removal of the broken ends of the bones has been found very suc- cessful, in many cases superseding amputation. A similar practice has been resorted to in cases of diseased joints, and with rather considerable success, especially by Mr. Syme of Edinburgh. ON ANEURISM. An aneurism is generally defined as a pulsating tumour containing blood, and commimicating ivith the interior of an artery. Although this definition will be found to include the greater number of aneurismal tumours, yet

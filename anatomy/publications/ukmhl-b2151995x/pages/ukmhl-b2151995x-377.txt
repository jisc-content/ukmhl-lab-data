ARTERIA ULNARIS. 3gl As the dnar artery descends in the forearm to the wrist t gives off only rmiscular branches, until it arrives near the wrist, where we have proceeding from it the ArtericB carpi ulnares, anterior and posterior- these correspond with the branches given off by ^he radial arterj with which, and the interosseous arteries, they anastomose freely around the articulation. ^ thiomose Opposite the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, the ulnar artery divides into its two terminating branches n.l1n n?^rT"'i"''''''' profunda sinks deep into the nem to tin ^ accompanied by a branch of the ulnar arteries!

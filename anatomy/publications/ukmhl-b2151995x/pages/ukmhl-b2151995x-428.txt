PHYSIOLOGY. 412 Besides which albumen and fibrine each contain one equivalent of phosphorus. Proteine may be procured by dissolving albumen, fi- brine, or caseine, in caustic alkali, and then treating them with a slight excess of acid, on which proteine falls as a white flocculent precipitate. It has no taste, and is in- soluble in water, but soluble in acetic acid or dilute alkalies. Proteine combines with oxygen, forming a binoxide and tritoxide. The former is soluble in water, the latter not. Proteine also appears to form a compound with chlorine. Albumen exists naturally in solution in the blood and most other fluids of the body. It is very abundant in the white of egg. Its solubility appears to depend on a small quantity of soda, with which it exists in combination. At a heat of 157° F., when concentrated, it coagulates, forming a hard, white, opaque, insoluble mass, its composition, however, remaining unchanged. Albumen is precipitated by many metalHc salts, as well as by sulphuric, nitric, hydrochloric, and metaphosphoric acids ; but not by acetic or tribasic phosphoric acids. Alcohol, tincture of galls, and tannic acid, also throw down precipitates. Its com- position per cent, is — Carbon .... 54-84 7-09 15-83 21-23 •33 -68 Hydrogen Nitrogen . Oxygen . Phospliorus Sulphur . 100- The presence of sulphur in albumen is shown by the black colour given to a silver spoon by an egg, as well as by the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen evolved during its decomposilion. Fibrine is found in the body in two states, fluid in the blood, solid in the muscles; the latter, when well washed, aff"ord fibrine, though in an impure state and mixed with membrane, nervous matter, and fat. Fibrine can be best obtained in a purer state by agitating the blood, during coagulation, with a bundle of small twigs, or by washing the clot after coagulation, with water and ether. Fibrine possesses the property of spontaneously coagulating on

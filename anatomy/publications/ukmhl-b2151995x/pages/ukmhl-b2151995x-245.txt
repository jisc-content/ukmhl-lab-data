THORACIC VISCERA. 229 like grapes to their stalk; and each lobule may be con- sidered as a separate lung. They are not all distended â– with air, in ordinary inspiration, nor by the most powerful efforts that can be made. Those of the upper part of the lungs seem to be most filled, and are most constantly in action. Each lobule is composed of a collection of air-cells, or vesicles, which communicate freely together; these cells vary in size, and always contain some air in the healthy state. The partition between them is imperfect, and is composed of a very delicate cellular tissue. These cells consist of a thin fibrous tissue, lined with mucous mem- brane, and upon their walls the minute capillary branches of the pulmonary arteries and veins ramify. The average quantity of the air which the lungs contain is not quite agreed upon; perhaps 200 cubic inches may be taken as the mean. This proportion will vary with the state of inspiration and expiration, as in each of those actions without effort, a ehange of from 20 to 30 cubic inches IS supposed to take place. The carbonic acid evolved from the lungs in twenty-four hours has been es- imated as much as 24,000 cubic inches, sufficient to afi^ord U or 12 ounces of solid carbon.

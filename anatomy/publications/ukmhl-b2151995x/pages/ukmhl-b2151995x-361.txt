AXILLARY ARTEEY. 345 accompanied by the axillary or brachial plexus of nerves, and the axillary vein or veins which obscure it from view. For the purpose of description the axillary artery is divided into three stages by the lesser pectoral muscle. In Its first stage the artery lies above that muscle, and is covered by the great pectoral and a dense fascia, (the costo- coracoid hgament,) which stretches across the artery, as it passes from the cartilage of the first rib to be implanted into the under surface of the clavicle and coracoid process; It rests on the first layer of intercostal muscles and the second digitation of the serratus magnas. The brachial plexus lies behind it, and to its acromial side, the axillary vein anterior and internal to it. The second stage of the axillary artery is that portion of the vesse which lies behind the pectoralis minor; it here crosses the axillary cavity, and is surrounded by cellular tissue and the brachial plexus of nerves, the median branch ot which has the artery passing between its two heads. Here a number of veins, rather than one large vein, cover the artery lying ,n front and rather to the inner side, and It IS covered by both pectoral muscles. Ihe third stage of the axillary artery extends from the lower edge of the pectoralis minor to the inferior ed-e of the latissimus dorsi and teres major tendons. Here the Zu^L \ u'^T '^^^^^^^on of the subscapularis mt scle; and below this, on the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, a plexus of veins covers it, as in ire '!rt l';""^'' °f the brachial plexus are related to it as follows: to its outer side are the median and external cutaneous; to its inner, the internal and cZmfl "^""'^ '^'""^^''^ musculo-spira and circumflex nerves.

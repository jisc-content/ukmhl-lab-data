378 REGIONAL AND SUEGICAL ANATOMY. that, from the bulb backwards to the bladder, the urethra is fixed by a dense fibrous structure, the triangular liga- ment of the urethra, or deep perineal fascia, so that we cannot alter the natural direction of this portion ot tHe canal; hence it is necessary, when passing a catheter or other instrument along the canal, to cause its point to ascend as soon as it has arrived at the bulb ; this is done by depressing the handle, the instrument being pushed onwards at the same time, when its point will pass upwards and backwards into the bladder; if this manffiuvre be not adopted and the instrument pushed onwards, its point may penetrate the bulb, and thus pass into the space between the inferior fundus of the bladder and the rectum. The triangular ligament of the urethra, or deep perineal fascia, is a dense layer of aponeurotic fibres, which fills up the perineal space in front, lying above the niuscles of the perineum and beneath the bladder ; it is attached on each side to the ramus of the ischium and pubis, where it is continuous with the obturator fascia; its apex turned forwards lies above the urethra and splits into two layers which enclose the subpubic ligament, and are .lost on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the os pubis ; its base directed backwards is semilunar, to accommodate the rectum, on which and the levator am it is graduaUy lost becoming there continuous with the -Pev^-l perm^^ fascia. The membranous portion of the V^^-^^^^^ through this ligament near its centre, at about one inch below the arch of the pubes: as the urethra pas-s through the hgament two layers pass off from it; one of them, the anterior or descending l^^^r, P^^^^^'^^^.^^''^^V^nveiW wards on the urethra, continuous with the fibrous covei ng of the corpus spongiosum urethr^e ; the other, the post^or or ascendLg lajer, passes upwards and backwards, forn ing (according to some authors,) the capsule of the Prostate gland, and is lost on the bladder. The triangular hgament is of use in supporting the pelvic viscera, a;^^ the urethra it prevents extravasated urine extending tiom the perineum to the pelvis, or vice versa.

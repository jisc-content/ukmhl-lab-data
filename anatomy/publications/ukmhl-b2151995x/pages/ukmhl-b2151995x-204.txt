188 ANATOMY, The external plantar nerve runs forwards between the flexor brevis and accessorius, in its course giving a branch to the abductor minimi digiti: it then divides into a super- ficial and deep branch. The superficial branch gives off a filament to the outside of the little toe, and then runs in the space between the fourth and fifth toe, giving a com- municating filament to the fourth terminating branch of the internal plantar nerve, and afterwards separates into two filaments to supply the opposed sides of the fourth and fifth toes. The deep-seated branch runs close upon the metatarsal bones, supplying filaments to the interossei, flexor brevis poUicis, and transversalis pedis muscles. The peroneal ox fibular nerve, one of the branches of the great sciatic, in its course is inclined outwards, and descends between the biceps and outer head of the gas- trocnemius, to reach the head of the fibula: a little below this it winds round the neck of the bone, and divides into two branches, the anterior tibial, or interosseous, and the musculo-cutaneous: the latter, in its direction, appears to be the continuation of the nerve, and descends between the peroneus longus and extensor communis digitorum longus, giving branches to them in its course. About the middle of the leg it escapes from between the muscles and descends between the extensor muscles and fascia, and divides into two branches. The external branch descends and passes in front of the outer ankle, reaches the dorsum of the foot, and gives off three filaments, one to supply the dorsum of the little toe and outside of the foot; another passes between the fourth and third toes, supplying both, and a third is distributed between the second and third toes. The internal branch goes to supply the inner border of the foot, and gives a filament to the inner side of the great toe. The branches of the peroneal, in its course downwards, are, one in the popliteal space to the short head of biceps, terminating in the ligaments on the outside of the joint, some articular twigs, cutaneous branches, of which one is named communicans peronei, and which unites with the superficial branch of the posterior tibial nerve, to form the external saphenus nerve. The anterior tibial or interosseous nerve, directly after its separation from the other branch of the peroneal, winds

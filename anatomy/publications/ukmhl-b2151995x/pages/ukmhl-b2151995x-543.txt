OBLiaOK INGUINAL HERNIA. 527 anatomy, is obliged to proceed with the greatest caution dmdmg layer after layer, as they appear, and can in no instance, a priori, ascertain the depth of the hernial covenngs; in some, the motions of the intestines may be seen through the parietes; in others, the superficial tascia alone is nearly an inch thick. The seat of stricture in oblique inguinal hernia has now been fully ascertained to be in general either at the lower margin of the internal oblique muscle, or at the internal abdommal ring; and this we should have been led to expect, from the muscular relations of these parts - at the same time, it should be recollected, that the stricture IS not uufrequently met with in the neck of the hernial sac, from the thickening produced in the peritoneum by the pressure exercised upon it, and in old cases of hernia may be at the external abdominal ring. Indeed the hernia may be strangulated in the interior of the sa'c, by the intestine perforating the omentum, or by an ad;en- titious baud of lymph. Such a state of pa/ts has been found in the cavity of the abdomen, when no hernia whatever has been formed, thus causing an internal strT gulation beyond the power of surgery The epigastric artery is the only vessel of consequence endangered in dividing the stricture, and this only when the constriction exists in the interior of the inguinal cand At the internal abdominal ring this vessel ]iJinteVnTmk S{nT I ""''V^ '''' ^'^^^^^ it ascends h gher than the hernia still to its inner side: to avoid it there fore, we should cut upwards and outwards; if we [n chne the kmfe inwards, there is but httle chance of the artery escaping.

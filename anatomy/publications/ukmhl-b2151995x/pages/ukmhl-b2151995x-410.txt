394 UEGIONAL AND SUEGICAL ANATOMY. THE POPLITEAL REGION is a diamond-shaped space situated behind the knee-joint, bounded by the hamstring njuscles and the heads of the gastrocnemius. On raising the integuments which cover it, the posterior cutaneous nerve, a branch of the lesser sciatic, is exposed in the superficial fascia; beneath these, the popliteal space is covered by a dense layer of aponeurotic structure, the popliteal fascia, which is continuous above with the fascia lata, below with the fascia of the leg, on either side it is attached to the neighbouring tendons, the condyles of the femur, and the lateral ligaments of the knee-joint; the popliteal fascia binds down the tendons to which it is attached, and assists in protecting the popliteal vessels and nerves from injury; it is made tense by the contraction of the muscles. In the disease, popliteal aneurism, it has the effect of prevent- ing the enlargement of the tumour posteriorly, and thus causes it to ascend into the inner and lower part of the thigh ; it influences popliteal abscesses in like manner. Both these diseases, parti- cularly aneurism, are attended with much pain from the pressure of the popUteal nerves between the tumour and resisting fascia. On raising the fascia the pophteal space will be exposed; this extends upwards into the inferior fourth of the thigh, and downwards into the superior sixth of the leg, meeting at each extremity in an acute angle, so that the space seems composed of two triangles joined at their bases ; it is bounded on the outer side by the byceps tendon, on the inner side by the semitendinosus, gracilis, and semimembra- nosus, below on either side by the heads of the gastrocne- mius, and in front by the posterior surface of the femur, the back of the knee-joint, and the Ugameutum posticum of Winslow, the head of the tibia, and the popliteus mus- cle. This popliteal space is filled with a large quantity of adipose tissue, in which the popliteal vessels and nerves are imbedded. In the lower part of the popliteal space, and between the heads of the gastrocnemius, the external saphena vein ascends ; it dips into this space and joins the popliteal vein, and is accompanied by numerous absorbents -which ascend from the leg to join" the popliteal glands. The popliteal nerves lie superficial in thivs space; they are

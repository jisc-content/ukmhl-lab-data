THE OS HrOIDES. 107 edge gives attachment anteriorly to the sterno-hyoid, omo- hyoid, aud thyro-hyoid muscles, and behind these to the thyro-hyoid ligament; its superior edge gives origin to the hyo-glossus muscle; at either extremity it presents a convex cartilaginous surface, by which it is joined to the cornua. The cornua are two in'number, one on each side; they are longer, but not so strong as the body; at their anterior extremity they are marked by a concave articular surface, where they are connected to the body; from this they pass upwards and backwards, becoming graduallv smaller, and terminate in a small round head covered bv cartilage. Superiorly they give attachment to the hyo- glossus and middle constrictor of the pharynx , inferiorly to the thyro-hyoid membrane; externally, to the thyro- hyoid and digastric muscles ; internally, they are covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The appendices or lesser cornua are pjTamidal in shape; they pass upwards and backwards from near the junction of the body and great cornua, and terminate posteriorly in a point â–  thev give attachment inferiorly to the genio-hyo-glossus muscle ; superiorly, to the stylo-hyoid ligament. The structure of the os-hyoides is chiefly spon-y, but the cornua possess more compact tissue; it is developed by hve points of ossification, one for each of its pieces which m advanced life become united, so as to form but one bone. The articulations of the os hyoides consist of those between its different pieces just described, and which possess unimportant ligaments, and are lined by synovial membrane: they disappear in advanced life. It is con nected to the temporal bone by means of the stylo-hyoid ligament, which arises narrow and pointed from the styloid process of the temporal bone, descends forwards and nwards becoming expanded, and is inserted into the lesser coruu of the os hyoides. This is exceedingly variable as 0 ize and is sometimes converted into bone, when the stj^oid process appears to be elongated as fa as t^e o

ANATOMY. 236 side, as high as the upper border of the second right costal cartilage; it then bends backward to the left, and opposite the fourth dorsal vertebra becomes the descending thoracic aortaâ€”thus consisting of the ascending part, arch, and descending portion. The relation of the three parts are chiefly the following. Relations of the ascending part of the arch: Anteriorly, first at its root the. pulmonary artery, then right appendix auricula, pericardium, remains of the thymus and sternum. Posteriorly, the right pulmonary artery and veins. On the right, descending vena cava. On the left, pulmonary artery. Relations of the transverse part of the arch: Anteriorly, partially the left pleura and lung, left vena innominata, left par vagum. Posteriorly, trachea, oesophagus, and thoracic duct, and recurrent laryngeal nerve. Above, the arteria innominata, left carotid and suhclavian are given off from it. Below, the left bronchus, the right pulmonary artery, the remains of the ductus arteriosus, and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Relations of the descending part of the arch: ' Anteriorly, the root of the right lung. Posteriorly, the third dorsal vertebra. On the right, the oesophagus and thoracic duct. On the left, the pleura and left lung. At the commencement of the aorta, immediately beyond the valves, three slight pouches are seen corresponding with the valves : these are named aortic sinuses, or smuses of Valsalva, and in this locahty are seen two foramina, the orifices of the coronary arteries. The branches from the arch of the aorta are : The arteria innominata, which divides iuto right carotid and right subclavian. The left carotid. The left subclavian. These vessels will be specially described with the ' Regional Anatomy.' The thoracic aorta gives off: Bronchial arteries, to nourish the lungs. (Esophageal. Intercostal, to the pleura, intercostal muscles, and spine.

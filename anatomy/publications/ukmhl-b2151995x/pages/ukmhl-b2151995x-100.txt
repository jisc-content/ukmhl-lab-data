ANATOMY. 84 fascia of the fore-arm, forming sheaths for the extensor tendons ; it is attached externally to the posterior surface of the radius, passes obliquely downwards and inwards, and is implanted into the posterior surface of the cuneiform and unciform hones, having httle if any connection with the ulna; by this means the hand is more intimately connected with the radius, and follows it in the motions of pronation and supination. The wrist-joint belongs to the class Arthrosis; its motions are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. THE AUTICULATIONS OF THE HAND. The articulating surfaces of the first row of carpal bones, where they are opposed to one another, need not be minutely described; they are, in general, arthrodial or planiform, and are connected by palmar, dorsal, and interosseous ligaments ; the palmar are the best marked; their cartilaginous surfaces are lined by synovial mem- branes. The OS pisiforme is held firmly in its place by several ligaments. Superiorly the internal lateral ligament of the wrist-joint is attached to it, as already described. Infe- riorly, two ligaments stretch from it: one implanted into the hook-like process of the unciform boue; another, an exceedingly strong ligament, and apparently the con- tinuation of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, descends from it inwards, to be inserted into the base of the fiftli metacarpal bone. A portion of the annular ligament is attached to it, and its articular surface is surrouuded by a capsular ligament, lined by synovial membrane. The articulations between the first and second rows of carpal bones are remarkable. In the centre, an enarthro- dial articulation is formed by the head of the os magnum being received into the cavity formed by the os lunare and OS scaphoides; on either side of this an arthrodial arti- culation is formed: these articulations are connected in front and behind by palmar and dorsal ligaments, laterally by expansions from the lateral ligaments of the wrist-joint. . The articulations between the carpal bones fornnny the second row are connected, in like manner, by dorsal and

THE INTESTINES. 24.5 in order that this distension may be more easily accom- plished. The duodenum first inclines upwards, backwards, and to the right, and having arrived near the neck of the gall- bladder, it bends vertically downwards, and again changes to a transverse direction, thus forming two curves or angles. Hence it is convex to the right, concave internally and to the left; and is divided into three portions. Thejirsf portion of the duodenum is in immediate re- lation with the liver and neck of the gall-bladder, poste- riorly with the hepatic vessels and small omentum, and is almost entirely surrounded by peritoneum. Its length is about two inches. The second portion, perpendicular, liasâ€” In front and externally, the ascending colon. Behind, the concave portion of the right kidney Internally, the pancreas. This part is from two to three inches long ; at the lower part of its posterior surface is the opening from the ductus communis choledochus and pancreatic duct; it is only covered anteriorly by peritoneum. The third portion, transverse, is covered anteriorly, by the mesocolon. ^ Bounded above, by the pancreas. Anteriorly, by the stomach. And posteriorly, by the vena cava, aorta, and crura of the diaphragm. The regions occupied by the duodenum, are the rio-ht hypochondrmm, the right lumbar slightly, and finaUy the junction of the proper epigastric and umbilical regions. It is distinguished from the jejunum and ilium by bein- shorter, more partially covered by peritoneum, confined to Its position, and by having more openings into it. Ihe ductus communis choledochus, after passing some way between the muscular and mucous coats, opens iiUo the duodenum, near the junction of the second and third portions and sometimes by a common orifice with he pancreatic duct. It occasionally enters as high up as tl e superior curve or angle, at a distance of two or'three inche from the pylorus. Tlie arteries of the duodenum arrtVon '-esi;::

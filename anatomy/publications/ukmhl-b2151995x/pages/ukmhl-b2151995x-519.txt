Leeches applied to the inflamed tonsils have been found very beneficial; free scarifications of the glands are much more so. By active treatment the inflammation some- times is subdued, but more frequently advances to suppu- ration, and in general of but one gland. As soon as matter appears to be formed in the gland, it should be opened, if productive of much distress to the patient but otherwise may be allowed to burst of itself. Abscesses in the tonsils should be opened with much caution, as the in- ternal carotid artery lies but a short distance to the outer side of the gland, and may be wounded. If caution be ob- served. It is of little consequence what instrument M-e use so as It be fitted to the object in view; a sharp-pointed bis- toury, covered with adhesive plaster to within a short dis- tance of Its extremity, or gum-lancet, or the peculiar instru- ment manufactured for the purpose, will answer. The point ot the instrument in opening the abscess should be directed backwards, or backwards and inwards, on no account out- wards, as the artery lies in this direction. The matter bemg discharged, the patient soon recovers. Emetics sometimes are given, with a view to cause the bursting of the abscess durmg the efforts to vomit. Some have recom- mended the application of a strong solution of nitrate of sdver, the Tmct. Capsici, and other stimulating agents to the tonsds; when in an inflamed state, the latter are not to be recommended, although useful when the glands are in a state ot chronic inflammation. ^ The tonsds are sometimes permanently enlarged from frequent attacks of inflammation.

377 PERINEUM IN THE MALE. tomy; the erector penis and crus penis bound the space externally, the accelerator urinse internally, the apex is in front, where these muscles converge, the base is posteriorly, and is formed by the transversus perinei muscle and ac- companying vessels and nerves; tlirough this space the perineal vessels and nerves pass from behind forwards. The trunk of the internal pudic artery Ues to the outer side of the perineum on the inner surface of the tuber ischii; it is here covered by the obturator fascia, and lies at about the distance of one inch from the edge of the bone and nearly three inches from the external skin ; from these relations it is endangered in the operation of litho- tomy. The erector penis lies on the crus penis, and thus is enabled, by compressing this body against the bone, to cause the erection of the penis, by forcing the blood forward into the corpus cavernosum or by preventing the return of the venous blood. The accelerator urincB muscle is united with its fellow on the mesial line; the two muscles thus united surround the bulb and commencement of the corpus spongiosum urethrse, and are enabled by their contraction to eject from this portion of the canal the semen, or the last drops of urine. When passing in- struments along the urethra, the spasmodic action of these muscles frequently prevents their introduction ; by keeping the instrument steadily in the part for a few minutes, the spasm subsides and allows of its entrance into the bladder. The transversus perinei muscle crosses near the centre of the perineum, from the tuber ischii inwards to the common central point of the perineum, and thus divides it into Its anterior and posterior portions ; this muscle is accom- panied by the transversus perinei artery and nerve which lie on its anterior surface. On removing the acceleratores urinse muscles the bulb of the urethra is exposed : this part lies beneath and a little in front of the arch of the pubes ; posteriorly, it is connected to the anterior surface of the anus by a li^a mentous chord, about three quarters of an inch in lenetli- this IS called the common central point of the perineum! from Its affording attachment, anteriorly, to the accelera- tores urin^ muscles, posteriorly, to the sphincter ani, and on each side to the transversus perinei Above the muscles of the perineum'it may be observed

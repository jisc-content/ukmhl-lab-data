Â°The ni^ of the P^-tar aponeuros is to preserve the arch of.the foot, and to protect the sott parts above it from undue pressure. On removing the plantar fascia, the soft parts m the sole of the foot a?e exposed. The muscles of this region are divided into four layers ; in the first or superficial layer are Abductor pollicis, Flexor digitorum brevis, Abductor minimi digiti. In the second layer are Long flexor tendons, Musculus aceessorius, Lumbricalcs. The third layer comprises Flexor poinds brevis, Adductor poUicis, Transversalis pedis. Flexor minimi digiti. The fourth layer consists of the Interossei muscles, Peroneus longus tendon. These muscles are also divided into three compartments, an^n ernd, middle, and external, by ^1^^ P'- ^ --"^.^ ThP difi-erent muscles and tendons m the sole ot tne foo" thdr oblique direction and decjsating with each other, assist in preserving the ^rche of the foot and keeping the bones in their proper position By tbe elasticity, too, which they communicate to the parts tbe foot enjoys that degree of alternate Yielding and res stance which render it so well adapted to support t e ^^e^^^^^^^ the body, and prevent shocks, as in leaping, f^^^^ from being transmitted upwards to the and Pma martow, so likely to be injured by any violent commotion of the body.

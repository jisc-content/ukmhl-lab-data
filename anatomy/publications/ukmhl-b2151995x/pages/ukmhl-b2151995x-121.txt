GROWTH OF THE TEETH. 105 do as to alJow of the exit of the tooth, and finally descends so as to form the periosteum of the fang, and becomes adherent to it. The teeth which are first formed, and which appear shortly after birth, are termed the temporary or deciduous teeth, because, at about the age of seven or eight, they fall out, and are replaced by the adult or permanent set: there are ten temporary teeth in each jaw, viz. four incisors, two cuspidati. four molares or grinders. The time at which they cut through the gum is variable, but they generally appear in the following order, com- mencing about the skth or seventh month after birth : the middle incisors of the under jaw, the middle of the upper, the under lateral incisors, the upper lateral incisors, anterior molars or grinders of under jaw, anterior of upper, the cuspidati and first those in the lower jaw, the posterior or larger grinders. Their appearance is completed about the second or third year, some weeks or months generally elapsing between The formation of the permanent teeth is precisely the same as that of the temporary, viz., by the production of pulps and capsules; the pulps which form them are derived trom those of the temporary teeth which send prolon-nations or processes backwards from their posterior surface for their formation, with the exception of the permanent molares; these, from having no temporary teeth to corres pond with, as the bicuspids take the place of the temporary molares are produced from pulps formed for them Zl which have no connection, as is generally thought \S the pulps already formed. The connection between the pulps of the temporary and permanent teeth k at firs ntimate, being both contained in the same socke • af cording as they advance, however, they separate and th. permanent teeth are lodged in distincf bony cells wh ib are situated below and behind the temporary cells'il th. mfenor maxilla; above and behind theS in ti supe„o^ 5§

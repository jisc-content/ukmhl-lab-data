The vessel being exposed, it may be opened obliquely If cut across, the divided ends of the vessel will retract, and a sufficient quantity of blood cannot generally be drawn. When the blood flows slowly, a warm sponge should be applied to the part, or the course of the artery filliped with the finger. As soon as a sufficient quantity of blood has been taken, the edges of the wound are to be brought together, and retained in apposition with a strap of adhesive plaster; over this a compress is to be placed, and the whole secured with a bandage brought round the forehead and under the chin. It has been recommended to cut the artery across, before closing the wound; it is in general unnecessary to do so, unless the branch divided be larger than usual. Â° Secondary hsemorrhage not unfrequently follows the operation, bhould It prove troublesome, the vessel may be secured with the ligature. As it is, however, difficult to tie arteries in the scalp, a better method is the introduction of a dossil of lint, moistened with spirits of turpentine, into the wound, and placing over it a compress and bandage as before: this method will never fail if properly executed. The cutting across the artery (if not pre- viously done) may also be had recourse to The operation of arteriotoray should never be resorted to when other means may accomplish the desired ends, as, independently o secondary haemorrhage, many other after-consequeuces result w hich are som-ces of much distress to the patient. The presence of the bandage is often found exceedingly unpleasant.

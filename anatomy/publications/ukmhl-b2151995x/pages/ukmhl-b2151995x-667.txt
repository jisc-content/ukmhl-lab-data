DISLOCATIONS, 651 The projection of the acromion appears greater from the depression of the deltoid being more considerable. There IS a prominence to be observed beneath the middle of the clavicle, and, on rotating the arm, the head of the bone may be felt to roll, the elbow is thrown from the side and at the same time, carried backwards, and the motions of the arm are more confined than in the dislocation into the axiUa. Reduction: The dislocation is reduced by the same means as are used in the dislocation into the axilla. Ihe extension should be made by first drawing 1, /T.i, 1"!""^^ downwards and backwards, until the Jiead ot the bone has passed the coracoid process, then it may be raised in a horizontal direction, when, by con- irT^ii ^'f''''' P'^«^"^^ «f tlie heel in the axiUa. the bone will be easily returned. la this dislocation the head of the humerus rests on the second and third nbs beneath the clavicle and internal to the coracoid process. _ Dislocation backwards, on the dorsum of the scapula IS of rare occurrence. It takes place when the arm is brought forwards in front of the central line of the trunk It IS readily distinguished by the projection of the head of the bone, and by its foUowing the movements of the elbow when rotated. lu reducing this dislocation, the arm should be drawn forwards. The head of the humerus rests n th s dislocation, on the dorsum of the scapula, immel ely beneath Its spine, and covered by the infra-spinatus ^ A subluxation of the head of the humerus, in which the bone rests beneath the edge of the glenoid Cavity and he coracoid process, is occasionally described asVfou th dislocation of the shoulder-joint.

395 POPLITEAL AETERY. derived from the great sciatic nerve which enters the po- pliteal space at its upper part and divides into the external and internal popliteal nerves. The external popliteal or peroneal nerve, the smaller of the two, runs downwards and outwards along the external side of the popliteal space; descends between the tendon of the biceps and the outer head of the gastrocnemius ; turns forward, winds round the neck of the fibula beneath the peroneal muscles; gives off several branches to them, and terminates by dividing into two branches, the anterior tibial and musculo-cuta- neous nerves; in the popliteal space it gives off a branch which joins a similar branch from the internal popliteal nerve to form the external saphenous nerve. The internal popliteal, or posterior tibial nerve, descends vertically, and nearly in the centre of the popliteal space, lying supe- riorly to the outer side of the artery, but inferiorly to its inner side, and in more direct contact with it; the nerve passes from this space into the leg in which it descends with the posterior tibial artery, and finally terminates in the sole of the foot in the internal and external plantar nerves. In the popliteal space the posterior tibial nerve gives off several branches to the heads of the gastrocne- mius, as also a branch of considerable size, the communi- cans tibiae, which joins the corresponding branch from the peroneal nerve about the centre of the leg, to form the external saphenous nerve, which thence descends on the outer side of the leg and foot to be lost with the branches of the external saphena vein. On removing a quantity of fat which separates the po- pliteal nerve from the vein and artery, these will be exposed lying in direct contact, the vein being posterior or super- ficial to the artery and a little to its outer side at the upper part of the space.

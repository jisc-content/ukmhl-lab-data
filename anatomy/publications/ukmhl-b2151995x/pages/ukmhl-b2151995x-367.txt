REGION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 351 it is separated from the vessel, passing down with the inferior profunda artery, behind the internal inter-muscular ligament and internal condyle. The internal cutaneous nerve, the nerves of TFrisberg, and the cutaneous nerve of Soemmering descend parallel, but superficial, to the brachial artery. The relations of the brachial artery at the bend of the elbow are of so much importance that we shall subjoin a distinct description and its relative anatomy here under the head of the REGION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. Upon removing the integuments which cover the upper third of the forearm, on its anterior surface, several super- hcial veins and nerves are exposed contained in the superficial tascia. The veins are, on the inner side the basilic, on the outer side the cejjhalic, and in the centre the median vein with Its two superficial branches, the median-cephalic and the median-basilic. The basilic vein arises from the inner side of the hand and little finger; ascends along the ulnar or inner side of the forearm on its anterior surface; receives numerous branches from the front and back part of the forearm • passes upwards in front of the internal condyle, where it receives the median basilic vein ; it ascends along the inner surface of the arm, paraUel, but superficial, to the brachial artery; and about the middle of the arm, but frequently above this point, and sometimes as high up as the axilla perforates the brachial aponeurosis to join the vense comites or axiUary vein. The branches that unite to form this vein are by many now named anterior and posterior ulnar veins» hJ^%''2^f''7^''' commences about the thumb and back of the hand; ascends on the anterior surface of the forearm and along its radial side; receiving^^ as ft passes upwards, several branches; then passes forwards n ftlt of the externa condyle, where it receives the medhn cephalic vem ; it runs along the outer side nf fl, f muscle, and finally, ascending in the Joove wl tb axillary vein. \his vein i:^;rg:t^^^^^

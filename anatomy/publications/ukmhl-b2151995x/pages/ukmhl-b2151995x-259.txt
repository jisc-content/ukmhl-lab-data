THE STOMACH. 243 The stomach is formed of three coats, a peritoneal, mus- cular, and villous, connected together by cellular tissue. . The peritoneal coat is external; it is a continuation of the small and great omentum, smooth and shining, attached by Its rough surface to the muscular coat. It does not cover the stomach along either curvature where the arteries pass. The muscular coat consists of three series of fibres longitudinal, circular, and oblique. The longitudinal or external fibres are continued from the oesophagus; they spread out upon the surface of the stomach. The external fibres are softer and more diff-used than the internal ones, and are more evident along the curvatures. * The oblique or transverse fibres form the deepest layer • they surround the stomach obliquely, often crossing each other, and are most abundant about the cul-de-sac. I he circular fibres, continued from the oesophagus, are most evident at the pyloric end of the stomach; in the centre they are sometimes strong, and give an hour-glass appearance to the stomach. At the pylorus they are much developed, and form, as it were, a sphincter to it. .Ja \ 7 T'""* '''"^ corrugated, soft, and of a totr^^ T 'T- t.'^' ^"-i l^bri^ated by a ,nn?

54 ANATOMY. it affords origin; its posterior surface is covered by the tibialis posticus and flexor longus poUicis muscles, which also arise from it. THE INFEKIOR. PERONEO-TIBIAL ARTICULATION. This articulation, closely connected with the ankle- joint, is formed by the convex surface of the fibula and the concave surface of the tibia, united by two ligaments, the anterior and posterior peroneo-tibial ligaments, and a strong interosseous structure, resembling fibro-cartilage. The anterior peroneo-tibial ligament arises inferiorly from the anterior part of the lower extremity of the fibula, passes upwards and inwards, and is implanted into the anterior surface of the tibia. The posterior peroneo-tibial ligament is similar to the preceding, and is not so well marked as the anterior. The tibia and fibula are also held firmly together by a strong interosseous structure, resembling fibro-cartilage; it will be found to attach itself firmly on either side to the bones above their cartilaginous surface. The lower part of this articulation is lined by cartilage and synovial membrane, which are continuous with those of the ankle- joint. This joint may be said to belong to Amphi- arthrosis; it possesses no motion. THE ANKLE-JOINT. This articulation is formed by three bones; the tibia, and fibula, superiorly; the astragalus, inferiorly. THE LIGAMENTS OF THE ANKLE-JOINT. The ligaments of the ankle-joint are,â€” internal lateral, external lateral, anterior and posterior tibio-tarsal, posterior tibio-fibular. The internal lateral or deltoid ligament is covered by the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor communis muscles, the posterior tibial artery, nerve, &c.; it arises superiorly from the inferior edge of the internal malleolus along its whole extent: from this its fibres pass in a radiated manner; the anterior are inserted into the under surface of the os naviculare, the middle pass dn-ectly down-

51 LIGAMENTS OP THE KNEE-JOINT. The internal ligaments are the following: The tioo alar ligaments are folds of the synovial mem- brane ; they arise on either side of the patella, pass down- wards, converge, and form an angle, from which arises the following ligament. The ligamentum mucosum arises from the angle formed by the preceding, passes upwards and backwards, and is inserted into the depression between the condyles of the femur; it is exceedingly small and weak, and is sometimes wanting. The transverse ligament is situated in front of the an- terior extremities of the semilunar cartilages, passing from one to the other, occasionally wanting; its use is to connect the two cartilages together, so as to prevent their separation when the femur rests on their superior surface. The crucial ligaments are two in number: an anterior a.nd posterior; and may be seen stretching obliquely from the femur to the tibia, in the centre of the joint; they are called crucial, from their crossing one another, and have received their names of anterior and posterior from their attachment to the tibia. _ The anterior crucial ligament arises superiorly from the mterual surface and posterior part of the external condyle ot the femur, passes downwards, forwards, and inwards and 18 inserted into the rough surface in front of the spine ot the tibia, and into the anterior extremity of the i?iternal semilunar cartilage. The posterior crucial ligament arises superiorly from the external surface and posterior part of the internal condyle of the femur, passes downwards, backwards, and outwards enlarging as it descends, and is inserted into the rough surface behind the spine of the tibia, and into the posterior extremity of the external semilunar cartilage. iTrtSr. connecting the femur, tibia, and fW?^'''.

92 ANATOMY. the root of these is the vidian or pterygoid canal, and the fossa navicularis; between them the pterygoid fossa, and the rostrum or azvgos process in the centre of the bone. Anteriorly we observe the sphenoidal spongy bones ana the openings of the sphenoidal sinuses. It is developed from seven points of ossification, ^vliicu commence in the body, the lesser wings, the roots ot the ptervsoid process, and in the internal pterygoid process ; in early fcetal life, it is divided into an anterior or spheno- orbital, and a posterior or spheno-temporal portion. At birth it consists of three parts, the body in the centre and two lateral portions, including the great wings and ptery- ^°Thn»-ocSses of the sphenoid are seventeen in number: one ethmoidal, one oUvary, four chnoid, one azygos, two spinous, two styloid, four pterygoid, and two hamuiar: some anatomists enumerate a much greater number con- sidering the wings, &c., as processes. The forammaje twelve proper and four common: the proper are two opUc two round two oval, two spinous, two vidian ^nd the t^o openings of the sinuses; the common are, two foramina lacera orbitalia, two foramina lacera anteriora in basi cranii. Besides these, the sphenoid bone forms part of the 7pZo-ma.illary fissure, which is a cleft or fissure situated in the posterior and external part of the o^^ ' and is formed by the sphenoid, malar, superior maxillary, and ^^The rotundum transmits the second division of the fifth nerve. . i.i,p fifth foramen o.fl/e transmits the third portion of the fifth nerve ^nd a small artery to the dura --t-'"J-^^^^nor meningeus parvus, and nervus petrosus ^"P^fi^''^^^^^^^^"^ The foramen spinosum transmits the middle meningeal artery.

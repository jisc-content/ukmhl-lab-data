ANATOMY. 178 the brachial plexus it pierces the fascia of the arm about its middle on the inner side, and is distributed by fila- ments, to the integument as far as the elbow in front of the inner condyle, and behind about the olecranon. The external cutaneous nerve, also named musculo-cuta- neous and j^erforans Casserii, larger than the former, pra- ceeds from the upper and external portion of the plexus : descends, and generally perforates the coraco-brachialis muscle; then runs downwards and outwards under the biceps and upon the brachialis anticus muscle; then be- tween the biceps and supinator radii longus; it then per- forates the fascia and becomes superficial, runs between the median cephalic vein and fascia, and descends as far as the wrist, where it terminates. Its branches are the following: iMuscular filaments to the coraco-brachialis, biceps, and brachialis ^"Filaments to the integuments, communicating with those of the internal cutaneous and musculo-spiral. Terminating filaments to the root of the thumb and the wrist, communicating with cutaneous filaments of the radial. The circumflex nerve proceeds from the posterior part of the plexus, backwards and outwards, beneath the mterior edge of the subscapularis muscle, accompanies the postenor circumflex artery behind the humerus, and wmds round it, to reach its anterior-external surface, where it is finaUy distributed to the deltoid muscle. It a so gives filaments to the teres minor muscle, one to the shoulder-jomt, and filaments to the integument covermg the triceps. ThewZwar nerve arises from the inner side ot the plexus, descends along the inner side of the arm, supported by the short head of Ae triceps, as far as the space between the inner condyle and the olecranon; here it passes between the two origins of the flexor carpi ulnans, and along the fore-arm, rests upon the flexor digitorum profundus, to the ulnar side of the artery, overlapped by the flexor carpi ulnaris ; lower down it runs distinctly along the radial edsce of the flexor ulnaris; when arrived at the wri*t n passes over the annular ligament with the ulnar artery and in the hand divides into two terminating branches t e superficial and deep. The filaments given off by it are tue following:

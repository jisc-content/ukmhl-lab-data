BONES OF THE HEAD. leadiug to the frontal sinus. Laterally we see the tem- poral process and part of the temporal fossa. The posterior surface, uneven, presents a ridge for the attachment of the falx major, commencing at a point where the frontal and ethmoid hones form conjointly the foramen caecum. The orbito-nasal surface presents the openings of the frontal sinuses; and laterally two grooves, which, by meeting the ethmoid bone, form the foramen orbitale internum anterius and posterius. The ^?-ocmes are nine, viz., nasal, four angular, two temporal, two orbital. The foramina are seven, five common and two proper The common foramina are the ' foramen cacum, tivo anterior internal orbital, two posterior „ The two proper are the su]}raorbital. This bone also assists in forming the foramen lacerum orbitale, named, more properly by Dr. Quain, sphenoidal hssure. Ihe frontal bone articulates with twelve bones VIZ., two parietal, ethmoid, sphenoid, two nasal, two la' crymal, two superior maxillary, and two malar. The layers of this bone are hollowed out and separated anteriorly, forming the frontal sinuses, which open into the middle meatus of the nose; these sinuses do not exist in very young subjects. The outer layer is sometimes fractured and depressed without any alarming symntoms or consequences ; but air may find its way into the cellular tissue, producing a form of emphyema. ^euujar The muscles attached to it on each side are— corrugator supercilii, orbicularis })alpebrarum temporalis, oocipitofrontatis, very slightly. OSSA PARIETALIA. The Parietal bone of each side is quadrangular, convex externally, concave mternally. The angles are four, viz.^

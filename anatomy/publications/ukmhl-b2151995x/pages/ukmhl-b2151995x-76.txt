ANATOMY, 00 The anterior surface of the scapula, called also the subscapular fossa, is directed towards the thorax; it is excavated to accommodate the convexity of the ribs, on which it rests, and to give lodgment to the subscapular muscle ; it is marked by three, four, or five obhque ridges, which run downwards and backwards; between these ridges the bone is thin and transparent; at the posterior part of the fossa, near the superior and inferior angles, it is smooth, for the insertion of the serratus magnus ^"^htposterior surface or dorsum of the scapula is divided unequally into two portions, a superior and inferior, by a ridge of bone, termed the spine; the superior part, called the supraspinous fossa, is much smaller than the inferior; it gives lodgment to the supra-spinatus muscle: the inferior part, called the infra-spinous fossa, affords origin to the infra-spinatus muscle; at its lower part, near the axillary border of the scapula, it becomes thick and elevated, and forms a somewhat flat surface, marked by two ridges; this is broad and quadrilateral inferiorly, where it gives origin to the teres major muscle, narrow and triangular superiorly, where the teres minor arises. The spine of the scapula is triangular in shape; it commences near the posterior edge of the scapula, by a triangular smooth surface, over which passes the tendon of the trapezius muscle, and from which it is separated by a bursa- from this the spine ascends outwards and forwards, inferiorly gives origin to the deltoid muscle, superiorly to the insertion of the trapezius, and terminates in the acromion process; this is a projection of bone, flattened superiorly and inferiorly, which overhangs the shoulder- ioint; anteriorly it is marked by an oblong articulw surface, which articulates with and supports the clavicle; the external edge is convex, and gives origin to the deltoid muscle. In general two or three foramina, for the passage of vessels, may be observed at the root of the spine. The superior border of the scapula is the shortest of the three â€¢ at the junction of its anterior and middle third is a notch converted into a foramen by the posterior proper Ueament, which gives transmission to the supra-scapular ,ierve the artery of the same name in general passes above ibis ligament; in front of the notch arises a long irregular

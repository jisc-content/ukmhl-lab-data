A'RTICULATIONS OP THE HAND. 85 palmar ligaments, stretching from one bone to the other. It may be perceived that several of these ligaments stretch from the anterior surface of the os magnum to the sur- rounding bones : these are to keep it firmly in its situation ; for although apparently the most secure bone of the carpus, it is most liable to dislocation, its head being thrown backwards towards the dorsum of the hand this is caused by the bone being so impacted between the others as to bear a considerable portion of any violence applied to this; and from its wedge-shape, and the apex being turned towards the palm of the hand, force applied in any direction, except directly on its base, will have a tendency to dislocate it backwards. There are five separate synovial membranes about the carpus :-1st, between the radius and the scaphoid, semi- lunar, and cuneiform bones ; 2d, between the pisiform and cuneiform ; 3d, between the first and second row of carpal bones, extending to the metacarpal bones of the fore and middle fingers ; 4th, between the trapezium and metacarpal bone of the thumb; and 5th, between the unciform bone and metacarpal bones of the ring and little fingers. The carpo-metacarpal articulations are formed between the second row of carpal bones and the metacarpus ■ thev are connected by dorsal and palmar ligaments, stretching from the carpal to the metacarpal bones : of these the dorsal are the more distinct. All these articular surfaces are lined by synovial membrane. The articulation betiveen the os trapezium and the first metacarpal bone belongs to the c\&%^ Arthrosis, and pos sesses considerable motion in order that the thumb mav be enabled to oppose itself to the other fingers ; its motions are flexion, extension, lateral motion, and circumduction- Its chief security is the great strength of the muscles of The metacarpo-phalangeal articulations are formed bv the round convex head of each metacarpal bonrbeiu^ received into the concavity of the first nb ,In„v .i ^ connected by lateral ligamLts on eiu t^ t ^ZZ ligament in front, which intermingles its fibiT^ifl f?^ sheaths of the flexor tendons, ancf a" 1 .ed : ei^a yt synovial membrane.

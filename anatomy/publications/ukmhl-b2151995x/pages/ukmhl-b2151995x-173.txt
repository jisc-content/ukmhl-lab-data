BASE OF THE BllAIN. J 57 The tuber cinereum forms a portion of tlie floor of the third ventricle, and is attached laterally to the convero-ino- optic nerves. * ° Behind the tuber cinereum and infandibulum are seen two small round white bodies, called the co?-pora albicantia pisiformia, or mamiUaria, but generally by the first name • they are composed of white matter externally, and grev internaUy, and are the terminations of the anterior piLrs or tne rornix. ^ Behind the corpora albicantia is seen a small triangular piece of grey substance, called the locus perforatus posticus, or pons Tanm It ,s perforated by numerous small blood^ vessels It forms a portion of the floor of the third ventricle. It is bounded laterally by the crura cerebri Ibe Crura cerebri are two short, thick, rounded cords leading from the pons varolii to the optic thalami Tev are prmcpally composed of medullary substance; but S their interior is a semilunar mass of grey substance wh rh from Its dark colour, is called locus nijr ' ' of "'"t'' ^o™Posed of the anterior columns the Z \ P-^iiS^-ly by additions fZ tUe ganghon of increase m the pons varolii From the internal surface of the crura cerebri, jus aft 1 their mergence from the pons, arise the third pair of ne v tlrtZ'TT ^^^y ^^'^ been traced S ii', crura to the locus niger.

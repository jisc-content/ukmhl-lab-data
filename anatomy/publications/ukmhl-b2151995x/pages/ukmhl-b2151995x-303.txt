This quadri- lateral region is divided, by the sterno-mastoid muscle into two great triangles, named the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck. ^ The a?jteno?- triangle has its base above formed by the ramus of the jaw, and a line leading from it to the mastoid process; its apex is below, and is formed by the sterno- mastoid muscle approaching the mesial line of the neck • It. anterior boundary is formed by the mesial line; its' po^stenor by the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid "^^x^ posterior triangle of the neck has its base below formed by the clavicle; its apex is turned upwards and IS truncated and formed by^he sterno-masS muscle approaching the trapezius; its posterior boundary t formed by the trapezius muscle ; its anterior by the p Jste nor edge of the sterno-mastoid.

STEENUM. 19 nearly their -whole extent, and have two epiphyses, one for the head, and the other for the tubercle; these are ossified at about 20 years of age. The Sternum is a symmetrical bone, situated in the anterior part of the thorax; its wpper extremity is on a plane posterior to the lower; it is marked with four transverse lines, pointing out its original division into five pieces; in it we occasionally perceive a small foramen, the use of which is unknown : the posterior surface of the sternum is smooth and concave, and forms the anterior boundary of the anterior mediastinum ; the superior ex- tremity of the sternum is thick, and excavated transversely, especially on its posterior surface, for accommodating the trachea, and the interclavicular ligament, and presents laterally two cartilaginous surfaces, for the sternal ex- tremity of the clavicle; the inferior extremity is the narrowest part of the sternum, and has attached to it a cartilaginous body, exceedingly irregular in size, direction, and shape, termed the xyphoid or ensiform cartilage, which, gives attachment to the linea alba, and the costo-xiphoid ligament; it is generally bony in the old subject. The lateral edges of the sternum are thick, and possess seven concave articulating surfaces on each side, for the recep- tion of the cartilages of the true ribs ; they are separated by a considerable interval above, but inferiorly approach one another, so that the sixth and seventh are sometimes not more than a line asunder; the superior of these is circular, and has its cartilage continuous with that of the first rib. The sternum in the adult is formed of two pieces, the superior of which, named manubrium, is short, broad, and triangular, the base turned upwards, the apex downwards; it is marked laterally with the excavation for the first rib, and a half one for the second, and is connected to the inferior piece by a cartilaginous structure, allowing of a slight degree of motion, excepting in the old subject, in which it is most frequently ossified. The inferior piece, formerly named (jladiolus, is long and narrow, tapering towards each extremity, and presents on each side the corresponding half articular surface for the second rib, and five whole ones for the inferior five true ribs ; the last of these is sometimes completed by the xiphoid cartilage.

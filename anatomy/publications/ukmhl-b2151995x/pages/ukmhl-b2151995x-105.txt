89 BONES OF THE HEAD. temporal of each side, forms the jugular foramen, or foramen lacerum basis crauii posterius; a basilar sinu- osity for the pons varolii, and lateral grooves for the in- ferior petrosal sinuses. This bone is articulated with six others, viz., two parietal bones, two temporal, sphenoid, and with the first vertebra by giuglimoid articulation. The Muscles attached to this bone are, to the superior ridge, trapezius, occipito-frontalis, stemo-mastoideus. To the space between the curved lines, complexus, splenius capitis. To the space between the inferior transverse ridge and foramen magnum, recti majores and minores, obliquus capitis superior. To below the jugal eminence, recti late^-ales. To the fossa, anterior to foramen magnum, recti antici majores and minores, superior and middle constrictor pharyngis. The foramen magnum gives passage to the medulla oblongata, with its coverings, vertebral arteries, spinal arteries, and some veins and the nervus accessorius of each side. The posterior condyloid foramen (when present) transmits a vein into the lateral sinus, sometimes a small artery from the occipital; the anterior condyloid foramen transmits the hypoglossal or lingual nervethe foramen jugulare gives passage to the lateral sinus, the nervus vagus, glosso-pharyugeus and accessorius, and a branch of tlie ascendmg pharyngeal artery, OSSA TEMPORALIA. The Temporal hone consists of three portions, the pe- trous, squamous, and mastoid. The processes arc five yiz zygomatic, auchtory, vaginal, styloid, and mastoid. rhe squamous portion presents for notice a thin semi- circular edge; the zygomatic process; a tubercle; the

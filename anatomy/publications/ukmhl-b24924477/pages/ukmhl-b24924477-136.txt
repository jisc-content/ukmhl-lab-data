78 FOURTEENTH SERIES. DISPLACEMENTS OF INTESTINE AND OMENTUM, (HERNI2E,) INTUSSUSCEPTIONS. 1 Inguinal Hernia. The testicle in this instance has not passed through the abdominal ring, it was found just within the opening, and is seen to be connected with the upper part of the hernial sac. The body of the gland is smaller than natural; the epididymis is incomplete, it does not join the body of the testicle. 2 Inguinal Hernia. A portion of intestine was found just behind the abdominal ring, stran- gulated by a preternatural band of adhesion extending from the peritoneum near the ring, to the mesentery. The testicle is situated just within the upper opening of the inguinal canal. The gland is smaller than natural; the epididymis does not join the body of the testicle. The two preceding specimens are described by Mr. Lawrence. Treatise on Hernia, page 243, edit. iv. 3 Inguinal Hernia, combined with Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis testis, and a membranous Cyst in the spermatic cord, immediately above the testicle. 4 Inguinal Hernia which has just passed through the opening in the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle.

The deep red colour extending throughout the interior of the stomach is occasioned by the blood effused from the eroded vessels.

In the oesophagus and towards the pyloric end of the stomach, some part of the mucous membrane remains, and it has a corrugated appearance. 10 Stomach of an individual who died in consequence of having taken Oxalic Acid. The mucous membrane is of a dark brown colour, and very much softened. In some situations it is so com- pletely disorganized as to have spontaneously separated in loose shreds. Upon the oesophagus, the mucous membrane is corrugated. 11 Ulcer, with discolouration in a portion of the Stomach.

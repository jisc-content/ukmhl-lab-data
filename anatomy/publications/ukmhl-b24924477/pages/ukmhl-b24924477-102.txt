44 FOURTH SERIES. DISEASES OF THE BRAIN, ITS MEMBRANES, AND BLOOD-VESSELS. 1 O 3 Portion of Dura-Mater, exhibiting a newly formed membrane upon its internal surface. This membrane is of considerable extent; it lines the whole of the dura mater covering the right hemisphere of the cerebrum; its thickness is about equal to that of the peritoneum, and it is very vascular throughout; it has been completely separated from the dura mater, except along one edge, where it is still adherent, and it will be observed that this edge is insensibly lost upon the dura mater, so that the internal surface of the new membrane and of the dura mater appear to be continuous. Towards its lower part, the new membrane is thicker than above, and it is here divisible into two distinct layers. Portion of Brain with its Membranes, exhibiting the same change as the preceding. The new membrane is here seen intervening- between the dura mater and tunica arachnoidea, and occupying an extent of some inches over the right hemisphere of the cerebrum; it adheres pretty firmly to the internal surface of the dura mater, and is very vascular throughout. Specimen of the same disease as No. 1 and 2. The new membrane is here very thick, but not of such considerable extent as in the preceding instances; it has been partially separated from | the dura mater, to which it was firmly adherent. 4 Portions of Dura Mater and Pia Mater. The dura mater exhibits the effusion of blood and lymph upon its external surface. The pia mater is thickened both in that part which covers the exterior surface of the brain, and in that part which penetrates between the convolutions. These changes were consequent on external injury. 5 Portion of Dura Mater very much thickened by the deposition of lymph upon its internal surface. The dura mater, with the adherent lymph, has been in part detached from the tunica arachnoidea.

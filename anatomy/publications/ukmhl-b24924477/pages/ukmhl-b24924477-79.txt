21 SECOND SERIES. DISEASES OF JOINTS. 1 Ankle-Joint, exhibiting the effects of Inflammation. The articular cartilages are completely destroyed, and the bones are in a state of ulceration. 2' Astragalus, exhibiting the effects of Inflammation. The articular cartilage is absorbed, and at one point, the bone is beginning to ulcerate. 3 Knee-Joint, exhibiting the effects of Inflammation. An abundant deposition of lymph has taken place from the internal surface of the capsule. 4 Ankle-Joint, exhibiting; Ulceration of the Cartilag-es and Bones. The ulcerated surface ot the 7 o O bones is very vascular. 5 Ankle-Joint, in which the cartilages are absorbed, and the exposed bone is covered with lymph. 6 Sections of the Condyles of a Femur. The connexion of the articular cartilage with the bone was loosened to such an extent that its separation could be readily effected. Portions of the cartilage have been detached and turned downwards to shew the appearance of the surface which was connected with the bone. i Knee-Joint, in which Anchylosis has taken place in consequence of a deposition of lymph from the opposing surfaces of the synovial membrane rendering them adherent, A portion of the adherent synovial membrane is stripped off and turned backwards. The patella has become firmly united to the external condyle of the femur, and the tibia and fibula have been drawn backwards under the femur by the flexor muscles, so as to give a very oblique direction to the external lateral ligament. 8 Condyles of the Femur, exhibiting a peculiar change of structure in the articular cartilage. The cartilage is thickened and softened throughout, and a portion of it is turned downwards to shew a partial absorption of its substance, which has taken place on the surface next to the bone.

59 TENTH SERIES. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES AND VEINS. Thoracic Aorta, exhibiting the deposition of bony matter between its coats, with ulceration of the internal membrane. 2 Aneurism of the Aorta at its origin, which has burst within the pericardium. The sac, which is small, has extended itself between the aorta and pulmonary artery, and has compressed the latter. A quill is introduced from the sac through the ruptured aperture, above which, a portion of the pericardium has been left in order to shew that the aneurism burst within the bag. The internal coat of the aorta is thickened and tuberculated. The internal coat of the pulmonary aiâ€™tery, where it is pressed upon by the sac, exhibits a deposition of lymph upon its surface. 3 4 5 6 Deficiency of a portion of the internal coat of the Aorta at its commencement, with dilatation of the external coats to a corresponding extent. Popliteal Artery ossified, and a part of its cavity obliterated. Right Renal Artery ossified, and the whole of its cavity obliterated. Aorta of a Dog exhibiting the effects of a ligature. The inner coats of the artery are partially divided, and above the seat of the ligature is a conical coagulum. This preparation was obtained by killing the dog twenty-four hours after a ligature had been placed on the aorta. 7 Sections of an Aneurismal Sac in the Abdominal Aorta, situated immediately below the superior mesenteric artery. The cceliac and superior mesenteric arteries are obliterated at their origins. The sac is completely filled by laminated coagulum. The coats of the aorta are thick and opaque. i 2

48 41 Portion of Cerebrum exhibiting changes in the septum lucidum consequent on the distention of the lateral ventricles with fluid. A large portion of the septum has disappeared, and in its place there is an irregular opening. The portion of the septum which remains is considerably extended and so thin as to be transparent. 42 Portion of Cerebrum exhibiting changes in the septum lucidum, similar to those in the pre- ceding specimen. 43 Portion of Cerebrum exhibiting a small tumor which was imbedded between its convolutions. The tumor is lobulated, and composed of a firm fleshy substance- and it was connected with the brain only by the pia mater and tunica arachnoidea. 44 Portion of Cerebrum exhibiting a small aneurism in the branch of the internal carotid artery which is lodged in the fissura Sylvii. The sac of the aneurism is filled by a firm coagulum. The sides of the sac consist apparently, in the greater part of their extent, of the dilated coats of the artery. The arteries with which the aneurism is connected are thicker than natural. 45 Portion of Dura Mater exhibiting a newly formed membrane closely adherent to its internal surface, and consisting of two layers, between which there was coagulated blood. The individual from whom this specimen was taken, suffered an attack of apoplexy a short time before death. 46 Portion of Dura Mater exhibiting an osseous tumor growing from the falx cerebri. 47 Portion of Cerebrum exhibiting an abscess in the upper part of one of its hemispheres, with the dura mater which covered it. The abscess communicates with the lateral ventricle by the aperture, through which a bristle is passed. The internal surface of the abscess is rough and granulated. Lymph is deposited upon the dura mater, and there is an ulcerated aperture in it, through which a bristle is passed. From a young subject. The consequence of external injury.

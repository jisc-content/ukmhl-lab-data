IT BONES, IN WHICH THERE ARE CAVITIES PRODUCED BY INTERNAL ABSORPTION. C. 1 Sections of a Tibia, exhibiting a wide cavity extending completely through the interior of the bone, and resulting from absorption of its cancellous and medullary texture. The walls of the bone are a little thicker than natural. C. 2 Sections of a Femur, in which there is an enlargement of the medullary cavity, with thinning of the walls. BONES, PORTIONS OF WHICH HAVE DIED. (necrosis.) D. 1 Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of the whole central portion of its shaft, shaft has been formed, and the dead bone is almost removed by absorption. A new D, 2 Sections of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of the shaft in its whole extent. The formation of the new bone is complete. A considerable portion of the old bone remains. D. 3 Portion of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of the lower part of the shaft. The new bone is incomplete. A portion of the old bone remains. D. 4 Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of the upper half of the shaft. The new bone is incomplete. A portion of the old bone remains. D. 5 Tibia and Fibula. There has been Necrosis of the whole shaft of the Tibia. A new shaft has been formed. Portions of the old bone remain within it. There is extensive ossification of the interosseous ligament. D. 6 Portion of a Femur in which there has been Necrosis of nearly the whole of the shaft. The new bone is perfect, and the old bone has been completely removed by absorption. D. Tibia, in which there has been Necrosis of the entire shaft. The new bone is perfect, and the old bone is removed by absorption. D. 8 Femur, in which there has been Necrosis of nearly the whole shaft, feet, and the old bone is completely absorbed. The new bone is per- D

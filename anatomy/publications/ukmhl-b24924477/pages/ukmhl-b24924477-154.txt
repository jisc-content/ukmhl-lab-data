Kidney, in which there is enlargement of the ureter, pelvis, and infundibula, with absorption of a great part of its substance. Kidney, in which the canal of the ureter is contracted at its commencement to such an extent that it will only admit the passage of a bristle. The pelvis and infundibula are considerably enlarged, and there is an almost total absorption of the substance of the organ.

57 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Section of the left Ventricle shewing several small depositions of soft medullary matter between its fibres. From the same individual as Nos. 5 and 6 in the Tumors, and No. 10 in Diseases of the Skin. Contraction of the left Auriculo-Ventricular opening, with enlargement of the cavity, and thickening of the parietes of the left auricle. A small portion of Lymph attached to the inside of the right auricle. A section has been made of the lymph to shew that it is closely united to the membrane lining the auricle. Contraction of the left auriculo-ventricular opening, with thickening and shortening of the cordee tendinese. Rupture of the left Ventricle at about mid-distance between its basis and apex. The aperture is of considerable extent; and around it, the walls of the ventricle are of their natural thick- ness. The muscular substance is unchanged. Bony matter is deposited between the coats of the aorta. Partial adhesions of the Pericardium to the Heart. Enlargement of the left ventricle with thickening of the membrane lining its cavity. Thickening and shortening of the aortic valves. Small Tubercles formed beneath the layer of the Pericardium covering the Heart, and beneath the membrane lining its cavities. Case of Tuberculated Sarcoma, described by Mr. Abernethy. Surgical Observations on Tumors. Section of the left Ventricle exhibiting the formation of a pouch in its side. The inner surface of the pouch is smooth and apparently formed by the lining of the ventricle. The pericardium is adherent to the heart in the situation of the pouch. Section of the left Ventricle exhibiting a large mass of bony matter deposited in the muscular substance at its basis. Heart encircled at its base by a broad irregular plate of bone which occupied the place of the external portion of the pericardium. The pericardium in the rest of its extent was firmly adherent to the heart. The internal parts of the heart are sound. I

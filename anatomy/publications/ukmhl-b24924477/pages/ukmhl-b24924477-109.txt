51 SEVENTH SERIES. DISEASES' OF THE EYE, AND ITS APPENDAGES. Eye, in which there is an adhesion of the cornea to the pupillary margin of the iris. Eye, in which the cornea is obliterated, and the humors have entirely disappeared. Of the internal membranes, portions of the choroid and retina are alone distinguishable. Eye, in which the iris is thickened and opaque. Section of a Tumor which filled the cavity of the orbit. The tumor consists throughout of a soft whitish medullary matter, in the centre of which the eye is imbedded. The only part of the natural structure of the eye which remains is the sclerotica, within which, medullary matter is deposited, similar to that which forms the tumor around the eye. Some remains of the optic nerve may be traced from the sclerotica through the upper part of the tumor. From a young subject. Eye, from a young subject. No part of the natural structure of the organ remainsj it is changed throughout into a mass of whitish medullary matter. With the upper part of this mass, the recti muscles are connected. From the same subject as No. 1, in the Tumors. Section of a Tumor which was removed from the cavity of the orbit in an adult. The tumor consists of some remains of the natural structure of the eye, and of a mass of soft grey matter, some of which is within the globe, and the remainder has apparently protruded through the sclerotica. Portions of the choroid membrane and retina may be discovered, apparently unchanged. Presented by James Gâ€™lllinan, esq.

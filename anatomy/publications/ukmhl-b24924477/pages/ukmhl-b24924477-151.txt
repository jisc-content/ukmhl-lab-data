93 Presented by J. H. B. Williams, esq. 22 Sections of a Carcinomatous Tongue. The change of structure has taken place in the basis and centre of the tongue, and there was a hard tubercle projecting on its upper surface. The diseased structure is very firm, with lines dispersed through it, and it is irregularly blended with the surrounding muscular substance. The left tonsil has ulcerated. A bristle is passed through an artery distributed to the tonsil, from which a considerable haemorrhage occurred just before death. 23 A Tongue, the under part of which is completely destroyed by ulceration. Around the ulcerated surface, the muscular substance has undergone no obvious change of structure. 24 A Tumor of a soft medullary texture filling the antrum, and thence extending into the nostrils, and into the cavities of the mouth and orbit.

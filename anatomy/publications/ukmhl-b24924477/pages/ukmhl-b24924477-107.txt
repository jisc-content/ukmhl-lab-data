49 FIFTH SERIES. DISEASES AND INJURIES OF NERVE. Popliteal Nerve, exhibiting the deposition of a soft caseous substance between its filaments. Anterior Crural Nerve from a Stump. The extremity of the nerve forms a hard bulbous tumor. A division of the nerve is made, to shew that its filaments are continued into the tumor. Portion of Brain, with the Optic Nerves, and some remains of the left eye. The eye is con- tracted in consequence of the escape of its humors, and the optic nerve is much diminished as far as its junction with the other nerve. Between the junction and the thalamus, the nerve of the opposite side is slightly diminished, and the thalamus on this side is smaller than on the other. Portion of the Scapula, with the Axillary Nerves and Artery, from an individual in whom amputation of the arm at the shoulder-joint had been performed a considerable time before death. The several nerves are firmly united together, and their extremities form hard bulbous tumors, which are adherent to the cicatrix in the skin. Portion of Brain, with the Optic Nerves, and remains of one of the eyes. The cornea is opaque, and the coats of the eye are collapsed. The optic nerve is considerably diminished between the diseased eye and its junction with the opposite nerve. From the junction, the diminution of the opposite nerve is continued to the thalamus. H

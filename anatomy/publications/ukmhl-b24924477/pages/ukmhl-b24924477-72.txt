Portions of the Skull-Cap increased in thickness and converted into a spongy texture. Section of a Tibia considerably thickened in its walls, with partial obliteration of the medullary cavity. The effect of venereal disease. The Skull, Femur, Humerus, Radius, and Clavicles, from the same individual. The skull exhibits in some situations, thickening, and in others, ulceration of its outer table at many distinct points. The femur is greatly thickened in the whole of its shaft. The humerus, tire radius, and the clavicles, are also greatly thickened in their walls. Presented by Wm. Beaumont, esq. Sections of a Tibia, with the Fibula. The shaft of the tibia is enlarged throughout. Upon its external surface there is an irregular deposition of bone. Internally it consists throughout of a cancellous texture, in which there is no medullary cavity. Upon the fibula there is an irregular deposition of osseous matter. BONES WHICH ARE PARTIALLY DESTROYED BY ULCERATION. Portion of a Tibia, exhibiting an ulcer on its external surface. Around the ulcer the bone is thickened, and has a porous appearance. Tibia and Fibula. Ulceration has penetrated the walls of the tibia to its medullary cavity. A deposition of bone has taken place upon the fibula, and there is ossification of the interosseous ligament. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting superficial ulceration, with thickening of the bone around the ulcerated surface. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting superficial and extensive absorption of its surface. A fleshy tumor, originating in the soft parts, was found extending completely around this part of the bone. Portion of a Tibia exhibiting deep ulceration of its walls, with thickening of the surrounding bone.

Hip-Joint, exhibiting anchylosis of the head of the femur with the ilium above the acetabulum. The acetabulum is filled by bony matter. Hip-Joint, exhibiting anchylosis of the head of the femur with the ilium. The acetabulum is contracted and there is bony matter deposited in it. Hip-Joint, exhibiting ulceration of the head and neck of the femur, and of the brim of the acetabulum. Hip-Joint, exhibiting anchylosis of the head of the femur to the ischium immediately behind the acetabulum. Hip-Joint. The head of the femur rests partly in the acetabulum and partly upon the ilium; and in this situation it has become anchylosed. Hip-Joint, exhibiting anchylosis of the head of the femur to the ilium on the outer side of the acetabulum. A distinct portion of bone extends transversely between the trochanter major and the tuberosity of the ischium. Hip-Joint. The depth of the acetabulum is considerably increased by absorption. The arti- cular surface of the femur is in part removed by absorption, and there is a considerable depo- sition of osseous matter around the neck of the hone. Hip-Joint, in which there has been absorption of the brim of the acetabulum and of the head of the femur. Presented by Richard Partridge, esq. Hip-Joint, in which there has been absorption of the brim of the acetabulum, also of the head and neck of the femur. Osseous deposition has taken place around the neck of the femur, and around the acetabulum. The surfaces of the femur and of the os innominatum, which were in contact, have become adapted so as to form a new joint. Hip-Joint, in which there has been absorption of the brim of the acetabulum, also of the head and neck of the femur. New bone is deposited upon the shaft of the femur, and there is ne crosis of the tuberosity of the ischium, which is in progress of separation.

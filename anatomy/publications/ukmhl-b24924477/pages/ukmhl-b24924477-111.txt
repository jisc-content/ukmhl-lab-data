A brown and soft fungous excrescence is attached to the skin, and in the cellular tissue beneath the skin there is a tumor about the size of a pea, soft and of a black colour. It appeared, that the fungus, originating from this tumor, had thence extended through an ulcerated opening in the skin. Verrucse, removed from the anus. Verrucee. The cuticle is in part separated and turned downwards, in order to shew that the diseased growth is entirely connected with it. Section of a Foot upon which there is a Corn. The cuticle is removed to shew that the disease is confined to a thickening of that part. The cutis beneath the seat of the corn is natural, except that its vascularity is a little increased. A large portion of Skin, removed from the back, from which a fungous excrescence of con- siderable extent has arisen. Hand and part of the Forearm, which were removed on account of a fungous growth of considerable extent from the skin. Case in Mr. Pottâ€™s Works, by Sir James Earle, vol. iii., p. 182.

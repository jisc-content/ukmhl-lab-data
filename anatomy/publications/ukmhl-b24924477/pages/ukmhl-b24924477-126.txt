The aneurism, situated in the upper part and right side of the arch, involves the arteria innominata. Very firm and thick laminated coagulum lines the sac.

A portion of the coagulum was found detached, and almost loose in the cavity of the aorta, as it now appears in the preparation. 70 Aneurism in the upper part of the Arch of the Aorta. Part of the sac is formed by the dilated artery, the coats of which terminate abruptly. The remaining part of the sac is formed by condensed cellular tissue, and by the sternum. The round holes produced by absorption, are visible upon the internal surface of the sternum. One of these penetrates the bone to its external surface, and there is an ulcerated aperture in the corresponding portion of the integuments. ( 1 Portion of the Vena Cava Inferior in which there is a lacerated aperture, about two inches above the iliac veins.

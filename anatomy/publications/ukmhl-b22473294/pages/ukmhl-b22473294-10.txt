REFERENCES TO PAPERS IN ANATOMY. 8 diameter of brim 6 inches. References to the alleged rapidity of parturition among the Esquimaux. This pelvis was pre- sented by the author to the late Professor Retzius of Stock- holm. 9. On Malformation of the Semilunar Valves of the Heart. (.The same, 1854.) Contents.-—Case of two large aortic valves and a small third valve. Symptoms of the case. Measurements of the valves. Apparently congenital, but valves diseased. Re- marks on alleged non-pathological variation in the number of the semilunar valves. The natural action of the semilunar valves. Their exact adaptations. Definition of an inferior corpus Arantii where the valves meet below. 10. On Rudimentary Ribs, and on some points in the Anatomy of the Vertebrae. (.Monthly Journal of Medical Science, Edinburgh, 1854.) Cotitents.—The facts contained in this Paper are included in the more comprehensive Paper on the same subject, No. 44. 11. On Branches from the Fifth Nerve to the Muscles of the Eye. (.Anat. and Phys. Observations, 1854.) Contents.—Account of branches from the ganglionic or sensory portion of the Fifth nerve to the muscles of the eye in some mammals, in addition to the ordinary supply from the motor nerves ; found in dissections made by the author in 1844 for his graduation Thesis. May be readily found in the sheep. Superior rectus receives two such filaments, internal rectus two, external rectus one or two. Superior oblique either directly, or more usually by filaments joining fourth nerve near muscle. From second division of fifth nerve one or two filaments to inferior rectus, one to join motor nerve to inferior oblique muscle, another to form long root of ciliary ganglion. Retractor muscle receives supply from fifth nerve, in addition to usual supply from sixth nerve.

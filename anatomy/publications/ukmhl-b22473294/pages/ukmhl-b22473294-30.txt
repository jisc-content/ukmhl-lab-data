Plate I.—Ten figures, showing variations in form of the pelvic bone, femur, and cartilaginous tibia in six Right- Whales, 3 male, 3 female. In fig. 10, from adult male, the hip-joint anchylosed. Plate II. — Figs. 11 and 12. Upper and under views, from 35-feet-long male, showing pelvic bone, femur, tibia, and their ligaments, the interpelvic ligament, and relation of penis to pelvic bone. Plate III.—Figs. 13, 14, 15. From same male, showing upper and under views of the muscles connected with same parts, and transverse section of penis and its muscular surroundings; muscles coloured. Plate IV.—Three views of the bones, ligaments, and muscles, from 48-feet-long female. Fig. 16. Ligaments of the hip-joint and femur. Fig. 17. Deep muscles attached to pelvic bone; small muscles attached to femur; hip-joint opened; capsular ligament of knee-joint. Fig. 18. Super- ficial view of muscles and aponeuroses attached to femur and tibia. Tibial band, prolonged from apex of tibia. “ Although, from the size of the masses, their fragmentary nature, and the decomposing condition of some of them, the dissections were not easy, the inquiry was a most interesting one. Nothing can be imagined more useless to the animal

31 BY PROFESSOR STRUTHERS. 50. On a Method of promoting Maceration for Ana- tomical Museums by Artificial Summer Tempera- ture. (Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, 1883.) Contents.—Boiling, or any approach to it, objectionable. Strong wooden tanks described, with method of filling and emptying. Water in tanks heated by hot-water pipes, 1 inch bore, galvanised to prevent rust, connected with boiler in furnace-room. Fire lowered when temperature reaches 95° Fahrenheit. Arrangement of pipes described. Heating by steam pipes probably preferable. Conduction by air of room not sufficient to heat large body of water in tank. Note on maceration in jars in furnace-room. Author has found these methods of great service in facilitating formation of the Anatomical Museum. 51. On a Method of Demonstrating the great Interosseous Ligament between the Astragalus and Os Calcis. {The Lancet, 1883.) Contents.—Astragalus sawn into three parts, so that narrow middle portion shall carry entire upper attachment of liga- ment. Exact position and direction of the cuts. Lateral parts of astragalus left hanging on by ligaments for replace- ment. Entire extent of interosseous ligament now exposed. Method also gives useful view of joints on either side of the ligament. Dorsal dissection and transverse vertical sections give useful views, but above method gives complete view, length, height, and thickness, and renders function demon- strable. Method showing interior of ankle joint may be combined with the above. Lower part of tibia and fibula sawn off transversely, and tibia then divided antero-posteriorly. The parts then admit of opening out and replacement. 52. On the Rudimentary Hind-Limb of Megaptera longi- mana. {Read before the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at Montreal, August 29th, 1884.) Contents.—Preliminary account of dissection of the parts.

Transverse processes; dissection of the soft parts, cartilages and ligaments, completing the lateral rings. 18 Bodies and their fibro-cartilages. 19. Articulations of the atlas and axis ; articular surfaces, continuity across middle line; transverse ligament, prismatic form, contact with odontoid; check ligaments ; ligamentum suspensorium ; superficial ligaments ; extent of movement very limited. 20. Occipito-atlantal surfaces. Form of the two divisions of the neural canal, separated by transverse ligament. 21. Explana- tion of the drawings. 41. Account of Rudimentary Finger-Muscles found in a Toothed Whale, Hyperoodon bidens. (The same, 1873.) Contents.—Hyperoodon, stranded alive at Fraserburgh, 1871 ; 19 feet 3 inches; maxillary crests 3 inches thick, 5 inqhes apart at middle. Account of muscles mentioned in No. 39 as found. Finger-muscles not before met with in toothed whales. In Hyperoodon are better developed than in great finner. Muscles found : Flexor carpi ulnaris; Flexor digitorum ulnaris ; Flexor digitorum radialis ; two ex- tensors of the digits, ulnar and radial. Finger-joints more movable than in finner, synovial cavity reaching completely across between the cartilages, surfaces flat. But muscles feeble relatively to size of parts on which they act. Rudi- mentary brachial muscles present ; much mixed with fibrous tissue, but have well-striped, good-sized muscular fibre. 42. Case of Subdivision of the Scaphoid Carpal Bone, probably from Fracture. {The same, 1873.) Contents.—Man aged 68. Scaphoid represented by two bones of nearly equal size ; glide freely on each other by nearly flat synovial surfaces. Appearances leading to infer-

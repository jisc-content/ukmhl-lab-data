15Y PROFESSOR STRUTHERS. 2 7 ulnaris; 2, extensor carpi ulnaris; 3, extensor communis digitorum ; 4, flexor digitorum ulnaris; 5, flexor digitorum radialis ; 6, flexor carpi radialis, found in young male only. Fibrous curtain along upper edge of ulna, from olecranon to pisiform cartilage; receives tendons of flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris ; not present in finner. In all these muscles the tendinous tissue continuous from end to end, giving liga- mentous function ; disappearance of muscular fibre would leave them as ligaments only, as in ordinary toothed cetacea. In Hyperoodon the teeth are rudimentary. 46. On the Bones, Articulations, and Muscles of the Rudimentary Hind-Limb of the Greenland Right- Whale, Balcena mysticetus. {The same, 1881.) Contents.—Inquiry undertaken to ascertain what light dissection of soft parts might throw on nature of rudiments discovered many years ago by Reinhardt, attached to pelvic bone in Mysticetus, and which he interpreted as thigh bone and leg. These parts dissected in ten Right-Whales, from Davis Straits, from 1873 to 1876. Life-sized drawings made from dissections. Specimens shown at meeting of British Association at Glasgow, 1876. Table I.—Measurements of pelvic bone from eleven Right- Whales, showing variations with sex, side, individual, and age. Table II.—Measurements of femur and tibia from ten Right-Whales, showing variations. (A) The Bones. I. The Pelvic Bone—1. Its nature. 2. Characters and adapta- tions. 3. Differences with sex. 4.

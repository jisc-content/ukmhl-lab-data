Septum ventriculorum deficient above. Further particulars and remarks, also by Dr. Greig.] 6. Anatomical Inquiry into the mode of action of Local Bloodletting in affections of the Internal Viscera. (The same, 1853.) Contents.—Three diagrams of the longitudinal and trans- verse arterial anastomoses of the trunk. Reference to the anastomoses of the bloodvessels of the walls and viscera of the abdomen and thorax. Argument, that local bloodletting on the wall cannot draw blood specially from the viscera, but only from the wall, including the parietal serous membrane. But that this conclusion is not necessarily against the practice of local bloodletting. 7. Dissection of the Orbits in a Case of Paralysis of the Common Motor Oculi Nerve. (The same, 1853.) Contents.—Woodcut of the dissected and prepared para- lysed nerve, the sixth nerve, the ciliary ganglion, and their connections and branches. Account of the case and its treatment. Post-mortem examination and dissection of the orbits. Third nerve wasted as seen with naked eye and under microscope. Ciliary nerves not wasted. Remarks on occasional connection between the Third and Sixth nerves, and supposed influence of the latter on the iris. This connection found in this case on the paralysed side, and a branch from the third nerve to the external rectus muscle. These connections not regarded as of functional importance. Observation made, that paralysis of the third nerve, involving the iris, does not interfere with the usual action of atropine in causing dilatation of the pupil. 8. Description of an Esquimaux Female Pelvis. (Anat. and Phys. Observations, 1854.) Contents.—From Davis Straits, T851. True pelvis very large in all its diameters. Measurements given. Transverse

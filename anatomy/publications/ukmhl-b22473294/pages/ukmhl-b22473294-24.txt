(4) Atlas and axis of another B. musculus, Norway, 1872. (5) Lesser Fin-whale (B. rostrata), at Aberdeen, 1870, young female, 14^ feet, soft parts dissected. Fig. 6, Atlas of this whale, seen from before, showing the transverse ligament. (A) Examination of the parts in the great Fin-whales. 2. Transverse processes viewed in relation to function. Great rete mirabile filling lateral rings. Rete mirabile of spinal canal and intervertebral foramina ; great size in comparison with spinal cord and nerves. Function primarily in relation to muscles and ligaments. Three stages of lower processes, root stage, tubercular stage, nerve-groove stage. Three stages of upper processes, nerve-groove, tubercular, terminal. 3. Ligaments of the transverse processes; great strength of ligaments uniting the terminal expansions. 4. Ligaments of the spines, laminae, and articular processes. Articulations between the bodies; fibro-cartilages, proportions of ligament and pulp; corresponding marks on the bones; amount of motion. 6. Articulations between atlas, axis, and occipital bone, (a) Transverse ligament, large, no contact with odontoid process, flattened in opposite direction to that in man; division of canal into two parts by this ligament, explaining form of canal in the finners ; chief function to attach part of check ligaments. (b) Check ligaments, arese of attachments to axis and atlas, are great interosseous ligaments ; correspond to lower check ligaments of man. (c) Lig. suspensorium dentis (occipito-odontoid), size of thumb. (d) Superior longitudinal ligament (occipito-axoid), prolongation of superior common ligament of bodies. Soft parts which separate right and left occipito-atlantal joints. The Cervical Vertebra serially considered.â€”7. Table of measurements in the four great finners. 8. The bodies. 9.

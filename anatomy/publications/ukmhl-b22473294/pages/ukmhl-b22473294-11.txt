9 BY PROFESSOR STRUTHERS. The preparations of these dissections, showing the branches passing direct from the Gasserian ganglion to the muscles of the eye, are preserved in the author’s collection. 12. On Diverticula from the Small Intestine, Ana- tomically and Pathologically considered. (Edin. Medical and Surgical Journal, 1854.) Contents.—Figures of twenty preparations of the diver- ticulum verum ilei (Meckel’s diverticulum) proceeding from the lower part of the ileum. In two of the cases the diver- ticulum had, by adhesion, formed a ring, as figured, through which a loop of bowel passed and became strangulated. In one it caused death without having formed a ring. Also figure of two false diverticula on the jejunum, and figure of a thimble-like pouch on oesophagus at the bifurcation of the trachea. Descriptive notes of these specimens. Historical notice, and remarks on true and false diverticula. [See also No. 34.] 13. On the Abnormal Anatomy of the Arm. (.British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review, 1854.) Contents.—(A) Varieties of the Muscles in relatioti to the Axillary and Brachial Arteries. Notes of the dissection of the following varieties, with remarks. 1. The axillary artery crossed by a muscular band; eight cases. Comparative anatomy of. 2. Expansion of coraco-brachialis muscle concealing the brachial artery in the upper third of the arm. 3. Brachial artery concealed in the lower half of the arm by a broad and thick third head to the biceps muscle. 4. Slip from biceps across brachial artery. 5. Muscular and tendinous slip crossing over brachial artery. 6. Tendinous slip from pectoralis major to internal condyle, crossing over brachial artery. 7. Brachial or third head to biceps muscle; notes of four cases. 8. Brachial artery overlapped or covered by a portion of the brachialis anticus muscle. 9. High origin to pronator teres muscle.

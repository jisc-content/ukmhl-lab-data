On Hereditary Supra-Condyloid Process in Man. (The Lancet, 1873.) Coiitents.—The process can be felt in the arm of the father and of four of his seven children. In father, on left arm distinctly felt, not felt in right arm. The children are five sons and two daughters. In eldest son process very distinct on left arm, no trace on right. Second son, slightly marked on left, no trace on right arm. Next three (first daughter, third son, and second daughter), no trace felt on either. Fourth son, process well developed on both arms, most on left. In youngest son (aged 15 years), process pretty well marked in left, no trace felt in right arm. Thus transmitted to four of the children, in three on same side as in father, and more developed on same side (left) in the son in whom process present in both arms. No reason to doubt that supra- condyloid process hereditary like other varieties. This variation probably occurs in other mammals. Varia- tion in cat already recorded (No. 13). Author has noticed process present in fossil bear in Palaeontological Collection in Jardin des Plantes, Paris. 44. On Variations of the Vertebrae and Ribs in Man. (Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, 1874.) Contents.— Description of numerous specimens of variation of the vertebrae and ribs met with by the author and con- tained in his private collection. Variation, if looked for, found to occur more frequently than usually supposed. Conclusions as to characters of species, or differences of race, must be founded on examination of a series of speci- mens. Interest of a variation appears when critically examined. (A) Variations in the Cervical Region. (a) Deficient ossification of the Atlas; anterior arch, posterior arch, transverse processes.

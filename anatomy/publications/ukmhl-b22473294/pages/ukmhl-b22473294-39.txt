(Read before the Section of Anatomy at the International Medical Congress in London, 1881.) “ The object of this paper is, by a comparison of British Schools of Anatomy with especially those of the Universities of Germany, to lead to the improvement of the former. “ Reference is made to the completeness of the anatomical institutes of Germany ; to the devotion of the teachers of anatomy in Germany to their department; to the complete- ness of the teaching ; and to the result, in the large con- tributions which the anatomists of Germany have made in modern times to the progress of anatomical science in all its branches. The system generally pursued in the ana- tomical schools of England is contrasted with this, as de- ficient except in regard to surgical anatomy. The system pursued in the anatomical schools of Scotland is referred to as corresponding closely to that pursued in Germany. “ The writer next remarks on what, according to his view, should be the constitution and aim of the anatomical school; that anatomy should be taught from the morphological as well as from the surgical point of view, microscopically as well as macroscopically, and that the teacher should be devoted to anatomy. Reference is farther made to the methods of the anatomical schools of Scotland as securing

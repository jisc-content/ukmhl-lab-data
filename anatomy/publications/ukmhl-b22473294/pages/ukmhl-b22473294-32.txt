30 REFERENCES TO PAPERS IN ANATOMY. attending the Congress. Specimens of the macerated humerus showing the process in various degrees of develop- ment ; specimens showing the ligament completing the arch ; dried preparations of the upper extremity showing the median nerve hooked aside by the process, with and without deviation of the artery; dissection of the soft parts in a case of the process ; specimens of the comparative anatomy of the arch. Remarks on the surgical importance of the variety, and on the interpretation of its occurrence in man. Discussion of the Paper by Professors Flower, Macalister, Lesshaft, Braune, and Keen. 48. On the Acetabulum of Animals in which the Liga- mentum Teres is described, as wanting. (.Read before the British Association for the Advancement of Science at York, 1881.) Contents.—Preliminary notice of Paper not yet published in full. The form of the recess in floor of acetabulum in man adapted to receive and cushion the ligament in the various motions of the joint. A recess present'in mammals in which the ligament is said to be absent. Finds the ligament not to be absent in the Greenland seal, not free but projecting from the capsule, with well-marked notch on head of femur. In birds the recess represented by a thinner part of the membrane that forms the floor of the acetabulum. 49. On the Correspondence between the Articulations of the Metacarpal and Metatarsal Bones in man. (The same, 1881.) Contents.—The correspondence is exact, not merely numerical (from within outwards, 2, 5, 4, 5, 3) but homo- logical. Articulate with the homologous carpal and tarsal bones, and in same manner by their terminal and corner facets. This correspondence has long been taught by the author. The occasional occurrence of an articular facet between the first and second metatarsal bones may be the result of civilisation.

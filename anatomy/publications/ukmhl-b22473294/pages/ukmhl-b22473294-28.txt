Account of Rudimentary Finger-Muscles found in the Greenland Right-Whale, Balmna mysticetus. {The same, 1878.) Contents.—These muscles found to be present in this whale. Fully as well developed as in the great finner. The observation was made in 1873 011 a 45-feet-long female, both paddles dissected, and repeated in 1874 on right paddle of a 35-feet-long male. The muscles found were—1, flexor carpi

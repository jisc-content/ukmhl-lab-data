222 THE CK LI, that the space occupied by the embryonic substance is partitioned out, so that anticlinal and periclinal walls intersect at right angles. This being granted, the network of cells in Fig. Ill m°ay be con- structed according to a well-known geometrical law. Let x x re- present the axis, and y y the direction of the parameter, then all the periclines, denoted by P p, form a group of confocal parabolas. Similarly, all the anticlines, A a, form another group of confocal parabolas, whose focus and axis coincide with those of the pre- ceding group, but which run in the opposite direction. Two such systems cut one another everywhere at right angles. "Let us now observe whether a median longitudinal section made through a dome-shaped, and approximately parabolic growing- point, does not present an arrangement of cells which corresponds in all essentials with our geometric diagram. We see at once, if we examine such a section, made from the growing-point of a Larch for example (Fig. 112), that the internal structure is identical, if Fig. 112.—Longitudinal section through the growing-point of a winter bud of Abies rcctinata (x about 200) (after Sachs, Fig. 2S5): 2s apex of growing point; bb youngest leaves ; r cortex j m pith. we disregard the two protuberances, b b, which interfere somewhat with the symmetry of the figure. These are young leaf-rudiments, budding off from the growing-point. We recognise at once the two systems of anticlines and periclines, which it can scarcely be doubted cut each other at right angles, as in the diagram; that is to say, the anticlines are the right-angled trajectories of the peri- clines. As in the diagram, further, only a few periclines under the apex 8 run round the common focus of all the parabolas ; the others, which come from below, only reach the neighbourhood of

On le onnt of the greater amount of protoplasm present » the upper Zof each quLant, the spindle is nnable to lie in the centre, as in an eg. in which eqnal eleavage oeeurs, but must approach nearer to the animal pole of the egg. Further, it » exactly per- l ndicular, for, on account of the unequal weight of then- halves, The qnadrants of the amphibian egg are firmly fixed m the egg space. In consequence, the third division plane must now be horizontal (Fig. 116.1), and further, it must be placed above the B C V Fis. I16.-Stages in the cleavage of Petromyzon. (From Hatschek, Fig. 72 ; A, U after Shipley; C, D, after M. Schultze.) equator of the sphere of the egg, being situated more or less towards the animal pole. The portions thus produced are verj dissimilar both in size and constitution, and this is why this form of cleavage has been called unequal. The four upper portions are smaller, and poorer in yolk ; the four lower much larger, and richer in yolk. They are called animal and vegetative cells according to whether they are directed towards the animal or vegetative pole. As development proceeds (Pig. 116 B, C, D), the difference between the animal and the vegetative cells grows greater and greater, for the more protoplasm a cell contains, the more quickly and frequently does it divide, as has been already mentioned above. Unequal cleavage can also occur in oval eggs. For instance, the egg of Fabricia (Pig. 117), as has been already mentioned (Fig. 109), in consequence of the collection of yolk around one pole, divides into one Fig. 117.—Egg of Fah- ricia divided into two cells.

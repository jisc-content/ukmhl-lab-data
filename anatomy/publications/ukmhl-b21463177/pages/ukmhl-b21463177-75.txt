ITS CHEMICO-PHYSfCAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 53 I have observed (IT. 19) that the germinal spot is composed of two substances in Helix, Tellina, and Aster acanthion, as well as in Anodon. Asteracanthion (Fig. 31) is of special interest, as the separation into two substances (p n, n n) only becomes distinctly visible when the germinal vesicle commences to break up and to form the polar spindle out of its contents. Finally, in the description of the structure of the resting nucleus, attention must be drawn to one other important point. According to the age or stage of development of a cell, the resting nucleus may present very considerable variations in all its separate parts: as to the appearance of its framework, and as to the number, size, and peculiarities of its nuc leoli. Thus, as Flemming (II. 10) remarks, " In young eggs from the ovaries of Lamellibranchs, this twofold composition of the large nucleolus is not to be seen ; it only develops in the mature egg." Above all, the germinal vesicles of the eggs undergo during their de- velopment important metamor- phoses, which at present have been but little investigated, whilst their significance is still less understood. The same is true of the nuclei of sperm mother cells.

In the vesicle a few linin threads are extended through the nuclear sap, the nuclein heaped up into one or two irregular masses, amongst which the more or less globular nucleolus is situated. In cells which are not yet mature, the nuclein is collected chiefly at one spot of the nuclear membrane in the form of a thick layer, whilst granules of varying size lie upon the surface of the linin tpn 1 kf nn ) J

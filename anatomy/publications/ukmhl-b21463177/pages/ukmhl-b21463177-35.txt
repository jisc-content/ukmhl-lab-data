ITS CHEM1C0-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 15 mass, it has been thought advisable to distinguish two kinds of protoplasm, the ectoplasm or hyaloplasm, and the endoplasm or gramdarplasm (Fig. 2, eh, en). Many investigators, such as Pfeffer, de Vries, etc., are inclined to consider that this peripheral layer is a specially differentiated organ of the cell and is endoioed with special functions. The following experiment which I have made seems to bear out this view. Some ripe e^gs of Bana temporaria, which had entered the oviduct and were surrounded with a gelatinous coating, were care- fully pierced with the exceedingly fine point of a glass needle. The puncture thus made was not visible externally after the operation, nor was any yolk seen to exude through the holes. However, some time after fertilisation of the eggs had taken place, a fair quantity of yolk began to make its way out of all the punctured eggs, and to form a more or less large ridge (extraovat, Roux) between the membrane of the egg and the yolk. This welling out of the yolk substance was induced by the act of fertilisation, for the entrance of the spermatozoon stimulates the surface layer to con- tract energetically, as may be easily demonstrated under suitable conditions. Hence the puncture must have caused a wound in the peripheral layer, which had not time to heal before fertilisation took place, and -through which the yolk was only pressed out after the contraction caused by the fertilisation had taken place Now since between the piercing of the eggs and their fertilisation a fairly long interval, which however I did not accurately measure had elapsed, this experiment seems to show that the peripheral layer possesses a structure differing somewhat from that of the rest of the cell contents, and also that it has properties peculiar to ledlof^miCal C;0mPOSiti0n °f Prot°Plasm.

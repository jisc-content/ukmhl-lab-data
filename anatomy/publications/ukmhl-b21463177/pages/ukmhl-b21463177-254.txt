P Free cell-formation occurs chiefly, in both plants and animals during the development of the sexual products. In order to demonstrate it, I will select three examples: the uperfioial segmentation of the centrolecithal eggs oiArtkropoää The for- mation of the endosperm in the embryo-sac within the ovule of Phaneroganua, and the formation of spores in the sporangia of baprolegnia. 6 The yolk mass is generally collected in the centre of the egg in Arthropoda, being surrounded by a thin peripheral layer of protoplasm. Hence the eggs are called centrolecithal ie eggs with yolk in the centre, in distinction to telolecithal eggs in which the yolk is situated at the poles (Balfour VI. 3). The cleavage nucleus, surrounded by a protoplasmic envelope, is generally in the centre of the nutritive yolk , here it divides into two dauo-hter- nuclei, whilst the division of the egg itself does not immediately A B n Fig. l-2.-Superficial cleavage of the egg of an insect (Pirns cvataegi) (after Uobretsky; from R.

THE CELL 14 sequence of a certain resemblance to slimy substances, was called by Schleiden the slime of the cell. Its refractive power is greater than that of water, so that the most delicate threads of protoplasm, although colourless, may be distinguished in this medium. Minute granules, the microsomes, which look only like dots, are always B Fig. 1.â€”Parenchyma cells, from the cortical layer of the root of Fritillaria imperialis ; longitudinal sections (x 550); after Sachs (II. 33), Pig. 75 : A very young cells, as yet without cell-sap, from close to the apex of the root; B cells of the same description, about 2mm above the apex of the root-the cell- sap (s) forms in the protoplasm (p) separate drops, between which are the partition walls of the protoplasm ; C cells of the same description, about 7-8 mm. above the apex; the two lower cells on the right-hand side are seen in a front view, the larjre cell on the left side is seen in optical section, the upper right- hand cell is opened by the section; the nucleus (my) has a peculiar appearance, being distended with water which it has absorbed ; Je nucleus ; Jcf: nucleolus ; h membrane. present in greater or less numbers in all protoplasm, and may be seen with a low power of the microscope to be embedded in a homogeneous ground sub- stance. Accord- ing to whether there are few or many of these microsomes in the protoplasm, it is more trans- parent (hyaline) or darker and more granular in appearance. The distribu- tion of these granules in the body of the cell is rarely regular. Generally a more or less thin outer zone remains free from granules. Now as this layer appears to be somewhat firmer in consistence than the more watery granula

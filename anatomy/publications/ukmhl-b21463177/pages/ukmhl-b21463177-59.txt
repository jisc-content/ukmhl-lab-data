ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 37 interesting vital phenomena of the protoplasm became more fully known. During the last thirty years, however, one discovery after another has been made about the nucleus, the result of which is that this neglected body has been shown to be of as much import- ance to the elementary organism as the protoplasmic substance. It is of interest that the history of the nucleus is analogous in some respects to that of the cell. The nucleus was also con- sidered at first to consist of a vesicle; indeed, it was even held to be a smaller cell inside the larger one. But just as it came to be recognised that the protoplasm is the vital substance of the cell so by degrees it came to be seen that the form of the nucleus is of minor importance, and that its vitality depends far more upon the presence in it of certain substances, the arrangement of which may vary very considerably according as to whether the nucleus is in an active or a passive condition. Richard Hertwig (II. 18) was the first to enunciate this clearly in a short paper entitled, "Beiträge zu einer einheitlichen Auffassung der verschiedenen Kernformen," in the following words: It is necessary to state at the commencement of mv observations as the most important point to be considered in classifying the various nuclear forms, that they all possess a certain uniformity in composition.

347 AS THE ELEMENTAL GERM OF AN ORGANISM mass as the sexual cells, from which the organism was derived, renders this assumption absolutely necessary. Secondly, we are forced to this conclusion, when we consider the fact, that in many plants and lower animals, even an extremely small group of cells is able to reproduce the complete organism. When a Funariahygrometrica, is chopped up into very small pieces, and placed upon damp soil, a complete plant grows out of each minute fragment. Similarly, if the fresh, water Hydra is cut up into small portions, each develops into a complete Hydra, possess- ing all the properties of its species. Buds may be formed from the most different parts of a tree by the growth of the vegetative cells ; these buds develop into shoots, which, if separated from the parent, and planted in the earth, can take root and grow into complete trees. In Goelenterata, in many worms and Tunirates, the asexual mode of multiplication is similar to the vegetative mode, since at each part of the body a bud can be formed, which is able to develop into a new individual. In Bougainvillea ramosa, for instance (Fig. 168), new animals are developed, not only as side branches of the hydroid stock, but also as stolons, which extend themselves like roots upon any surface, and serve to attach the colony. Thirdly, many processes of re- generation, or re- placement of lost parts, prove that in addition, to the pro- perties, which are evidently exercised, there must be others which are-latent, but which are capable of development under abnormal conditions.

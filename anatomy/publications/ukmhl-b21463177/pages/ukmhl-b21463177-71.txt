49 ITS CHEM1C0-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Moreover, the nuclein is not; always spread out upon a frame- work. For example, the large vesicular nuclei of Chironomus larvce (Fig. 27) enclose, as Balbiani (II. 2) has discovered, a single thick nuclear thread ; this is variously twisted, and in stained prepara- tion is seen to be composed of regular alternately stained and unstained layers. This has also been observed by Strasburger in some plants. The two ends of the thread terminate in nucleoli. Further, in other cases the greater part of the nuclein is collected into a large round body, which looks like a nucleolus, but which is really very different from the above-described true nucleoli, which contain paranuclei (p. 42). In order to avoid confusion it is best to call such bodies nuclein corpuscles. As an example of this class the nucleus of Spirogyra may be mentioned; the nuclei of many of the lower organisms are very similar to it in structure.

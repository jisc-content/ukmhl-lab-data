ßß THE CELL In addition there will be a special chapter on the process of fertilisation. . The cell may exhibit several kinds of movement, as is seen it an extensive comparative study is made. We will here distinguish _ between- (1) true protoplasmic movements ; (2) ciliary or flagellar movements ; (3) the movements of the pulsating vacuole ; (4) the passive movements and changes of shape exhibited by cells. In addition to these four, there are a few special phenomena of motion, of which it will be best to treat in later chapters, for example, the formation of the receptive protuberance which appears in the egg-cell in consequence of fertilisation ; the radiation figures which are seen in the neighbourhood of the spermatozoon after it has penetrated into the ovum, and those which occur during the pless of cell division, when the cell body splits up into two or TÄsmic Movements. Although it is probable that movements take place in all protoplasm, yet in most cases, wit ourpresent means of observation, they cannot be perceived ou aocouu of their great slowness ; hence in only a few objects n Re plant and animal kingdoms can this phenomenon be stud.d / demonstrated The movement manifests itself partly in 1>V ' '^Movements of naked Protoplasm.

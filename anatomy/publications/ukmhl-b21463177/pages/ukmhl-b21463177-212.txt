1^0 THE GELL what was formerly the pole of the division figure; it is enclosed m granular protoplasm, which contracts with the yolk substance of the egg, and has been named by van Beneden the attraction sphere, and by Boveri the archoplasm. Before the nucleus has quite returned to the resting condition and even sometimes before the first division is completed, it com- mences to make preparations to divide a second time ; these start with changes in the centrosome (Fig. 84), which extends itself Fig. 81. Fig. 83.-Dividing egg of A,caris megalocephala. The nuclei are preparing to divide- the centrosomes are divided. (After Boveri, PI. IV., Figs. 75, 76.)

VI., Fig. 13.) longitudinally parallel to the first division plane, becomes biscuit- shaped, and divides itself by a constriction into two daughter centrosomes, which for a time are enclosed by one common granu- lar sphere; these phenomena were discovered by van Beneden (VI. 4b) and Boveri (VI. 6, 1888). Next, the two centrosomes separate somewhat from one another (Fig. 83), in consequence of which their common radiation sphei'e becomes converted into two spheres. This division of the centrosomes gives the signal, as it were, for the occurrence of the following changes in the nucleus, although the latter is not yet completely at rest (Fig. 83). The nuclein withdraws itself out of the framework, and collects in four long loops, the surfaces of which are at first uneven, but later on become smooth. The four loops are turned in the same direction as the daughter-segments after the first division, so that Boveri (IV. 6) agrees with the opinion expressed by Rabl (VI. 53), that they are derived directly from the substance of the seg- ments, and that even when the nucleus is resting they have an

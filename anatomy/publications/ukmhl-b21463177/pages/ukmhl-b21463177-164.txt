J-"*4 THE CELL the Rhizopoda eagerly seize upon them, so that after a short time their whole bodies are quite filled with them. Infusoria (Fig. 50) eat Flagellata, unicellular Algae and Bacteria, conveying them into their endoplasm through an opening in their cuticle which functions as a mouth. Here a vacuole filled with fluid forms itself round each foreign body, which undergoes digestion. Na cv Fig. 60.â€”Actinosplicerium Eichhomi (after B. Hertwisr, Zool., Fig. 117): M medullary substance with nuclei (n); K cortical substance with contractile vacuoles (cd) ; Na nutrient material. In a similar manner to that shown by unicellular organisms, many tissue cells of Metazoa devour solid substances offered to them, and digest them. Intracellular digestion, as it has been termed by Metchnikoff (V. 12), occurs very frequently in Invertebrates; it may be best demonstrated by means of feeding experiments with easily recog- nisable substances, such as granules of colouring matter, globules of milk, spores of fungi, etc. In some Coelenterata the ectoderm as well as the endoderm takes up foreign bodies. The tentacular ends of Actinia may load themselves with carmine granules, which

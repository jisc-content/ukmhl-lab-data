ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 19 examined • in the latter, its most minute structure has been rendered visible, by means of various staining reagents; thus we have already a considerable amount of literature on the subject of the structure of protoplasm. Starting with the assumption that protoplasm consists of a mixture of a small quantity of solid substances with a large quantity of fluid, to which circumstance it owes its peculiar viscid property as a whole, the question might be raised as to whether it be possible, by using the strongest lenses, to distinguish optically the solid particles from the fluid which contains them, and to recognise their arrangement into special structures. A priori, it does not seem to be necessary to distinguish them from one another, siuce the solid particles are so very small, and since they differ so little from the fluid in their refractive power I hus, according to NägeWs micellar theory, which will be de- scribed m detail later on, they are supposed to be arranged as a framework, which, however, in consequence of the minute size of the hypothetical micellse, escapes our observation. In a word it is possible that protoplasm may have a very complicated structure, although it appears to us to be a homogeneous body. Hence the expression homogeneous protoplasm does not necessarily imply that protoplasm does not possess a definite structure or organisation. Recent observations, for which powerful oil immersion lenses have been successfully used, point more and more to the 2cl22 that protoplasm possesses a structure which may be opticallv demonstrated; however ;n^;m'vq„oi • . 3 optically tiallv ;„ +), °0WCTei' ""dividual microseopists differ so essen- t.ally n their views upoa the nature of this structure that it is impossible^ come to any definite decision upon the su^e t At the present time, at least four conflicting theories hold the field; these may be described as the framework theo v tue f„„ or honeycomb theory, the filament theory, and the gZla th o^ dl. 36), and' by oL^J^^fZr^ consists of a very fine network of fibriürä or bread ^ »Hees of which the fluid is held T I M ' ^ ^

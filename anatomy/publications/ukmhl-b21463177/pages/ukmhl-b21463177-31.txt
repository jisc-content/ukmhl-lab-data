CHAPTER II THE CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MOBPHOLOGICAL PKOPEKTIES OF THE CELL The cell is an organism, and by no means a simple one, being built up of many different parts. To ascertain with accuracy the true nature of all these constituents, which, for the greater part, elude our observation at present, will remain a problem for biological research for a long time. Our position, with regard to the cell, is similar to that of investigators towards the whole animal or vege- table body a hundred years ago, before the discovery of the cell theory. In order to penetrate more deeply into the secrets of the cell, optical instruments, and, above all, methods of chemical examination, must be brought to a much higher degree of perfec- tion than they have attained at present. It seems best to me to lay stress on these points to start with, in order that the student may have them always before his mind's eye in reading the follow- ing account. In each cell there is invariably to be seen one specially well- defined portion, the nucleus, which throughout the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom is very uniform in appearance; evidently the nucleus and the remaining portion of the cell have different functions to perform in the elementary organism. Hence the examination of the chemico-physical and morphological proper- ties of the cell becomes naturally divided into two sections the examination of the protoplasm and of the nucleus. To these, three short sections are added. The first deals with the question, Are there cells which possess no nuclei P The second treats of the pole or central corpuscles, which are at times - a.pec.aleell,^ in addition to the nucleus ; and in the third a short account is given of NÃ¤geli's theory of the mole cular structure of organic bodies oMhlp^o^ and MorPhological Properties Ot the Protoplasm. Some animal and plant-cells appear to dzffer so much from one another as to their form and IZJs

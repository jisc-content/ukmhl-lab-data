THE YITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL 155 The cell sap, however, is not pure water, but a very complex, nutrient solution containing veget- able acids and their salts, nit- rates and phos- phates, sugar, and small quantities of dissolved pro- teids, etc. Thus between the pro- toplasm and the sap ( material is interchanged to a considerable ex- tent, substances for use being ex- tracted from the one, which in return receives other substances in exchange. Since the sap re- presents a con- centrated solu- tion of osmotic substances, it ex- erts a powerful attraction upon water, and also an internal pres- sure, which is of- ten considerable, npon the envelope surrounding it, thus producing a tense condition, described on p. 141 as turgor. Many botanists, especially do Vries (V. 35) and Went, consider the vacuoles to be special cell organs, which are not of accidental Fig. 6?.â€”Parenchyma cells from the cortical layer of the root of Fritillaria imperialis (longitudinal sections, x 650: after Sachs II. 33, Fig. 75): A very young cells, as yet without cell-sap, from close to the apex of the root; B cells of the same description, about 2 mm. above the apex of the root; the cell- sap (o) forms in the protoplasm (p) separate drops between which are partition walls of protoplasm ; C cells of the same description, about 7-8 mm. above the apex ; the two lower cells on the right hand side are seen in a front view; the large cell on the left hand side is seen in optical section ; the upper right hand cell is opened by the section ; the nucleus (xy) has a peculiar appearance, in consequence of its beins; dis- tended, owing to the absorption of water; k nucleus; kk nu- cleolus; 7t membrane. which was

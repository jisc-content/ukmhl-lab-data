Each thread then divides into two twisted loops of equal size, the nuclear segments (Fig. 142 II). On either side of the pair of nuclei a centrosome makes its appearance; however, up till now, no one has been so fortunate as to observe whence these are derived. The line of demarcation between the two nuclei and the surrounding yolk now disappears. Between the two centrosomes (Fig. 142 J/J), which are sur- rounded by a radiation sphere, spindle fibrils, develop ; these are at first faint, but later on are distinctly visible; they arrange themselves about the four nuclear-segments, which have been set free by the breaking up of the nuclear vesicles, so that they rest externally upon the middle of the spindle.

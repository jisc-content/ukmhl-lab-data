15G THE CELL formation in the cell-body, but which can only be produced by division. Even in the youngest plant-cells, according to their opinion, minute vacuoles are present, which multiply continually by fission, and which are distributed amongst the daughter cells when cell division occurs. Here all the vacuoles of the whole plant would originate from those of the meristem. This theory however is disputed by other investigators. Just as the proto- plasm is bounded externally by a peripheral layer, the vacuoles, in de Vries' opinion, possess a special wall (the tonoplast), which regulates the secretion and accumulation of the dissolved sub- stances present in the cell sap.

The formation of vacuoles also occurs to a considerable extent in the lower organisms. In Actinosphairium, for example, the protoplasmic body has quite a foamy appearance, in consequence of the large number of great and small vacuoles present in it. A few vacuoles, the number of which is constant, acquire a specially contractile peripheral layer; they are then described as

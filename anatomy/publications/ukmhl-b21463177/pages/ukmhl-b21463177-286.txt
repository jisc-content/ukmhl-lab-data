The nuclear plate consists of twenty-four nuclear segments. (After Guignard XVI. Fig. 83.) (Fig. 144) then coalesce, as do also the four centrosomes ; these latter unite so as to form two new pairs, of which each is composed of one element of male and one of female origin. The new pairs are situated on op- posite sides of the cleavage nucleus, and there develop into the two centrosomes of the first nuclear spindle (Fig. 145). In the same way as in animal sexual cells, the nuclein and the number of nuclear seg- ments derived from it are decreased during the formation of the pollen-cell and of the egg-cell to one half of the quantity present in a normal nucleus. For instance, whilst in Lilium martagon the normal nucleus de- velops during its division 24 nuclear seg- ments which split up into 48 daughter-

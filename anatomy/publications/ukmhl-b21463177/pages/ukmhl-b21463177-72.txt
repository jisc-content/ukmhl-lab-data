50 THE CELL differ considerably in their structure from the nuclei met with in ordinary tissues, as may be seen from Figs. 28, 29, 30. Fig. 28 represents the immature egg of a sea urchin ; if it is ex- amined when alive, an exceedingly coarse network of rather thick isolated threads can be distinguished. These, as is shown by their micro-chemical properties, consist chiefly of hnin. The stained material is nearly all collected into a single large round body, the " germinal spÂ»t" which lies in a net-knot of the frame- work, where the greatest number of linin threads intersect. In the enormously large germinal vesicles, for which the large eggs of Fishes, Amphibians, and Reptiles, which are so rich in yolk, nre remarkable, the number of germinal spots increases consider- kn Fig. 28.

In a dense nuclear net (kn) a very large number of germinal spots, mostly peripheral (fc/), are to be seen. (O.

The position of the (Terminal spots varies at different times ; generally, however, they are situated on the surface of the vesicle, being distributed at even distances over the membrane, as is shown in Fig. 29, where the nucleus of a rather small immature egg of a frog is depicted. The shape of the germinal spots also varies ; they may be ronnd- this is especially the case when they are isolated-or oval; some- times they are somewhat extended, at others they are constricted in the middle ; occasionally they are irregular m outline, and when

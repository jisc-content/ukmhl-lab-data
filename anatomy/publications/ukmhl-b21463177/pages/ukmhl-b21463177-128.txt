106 THE CELL In addition, the chlorophyll granules themselves, when under the ■'mfluence of intense light, alter their shape, becoming smaller and more globular. All these occurrences serve to accomplish the same end: " Chlorophyll granules protect themselves by turning on their axes (Mesocarpus), by migration, or by altering their shapes from intense illumination." " If the illumination is weak, the largest surfaces are turned towards the light, in order that as much of it may be received as possible. The behaviour is exactly the oppo- site when the light is strong, a smaller surface being then exposed to the light." III. Electrical Stimuli. As has been shown by the experi- ments of Max Schultze (I. 29), of Kühne (IV. 15), of Engelmann, and of Ver- worn (IV. 39), electrical currents, both constant and induced, act as stimuli upon protoplasm, when they flow directly through it. If some staminal hairs of Tradescantia (Fig. £3) are placed between non-polar- isable electrodes which are close together, and are then stimulated by means of weak induction shocks, the granular streaming move- ments can be seen to have been influenced in that por- tion of the protoplasmic net through which the current flowed. Irregular masses and globules develop upon the protoplasmic threads ; these separate off at the thinnest places, and become absorbed into neighbouring threads. After a short period of rest, the move- ments recommence, the Fig. 53.—A, B cell of a stnminal hair of Tra- descantia virginica. A Normal condition of proto- plasm before it has been disturbed.

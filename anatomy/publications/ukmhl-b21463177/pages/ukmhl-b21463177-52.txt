30 THE CELL beyond a doubt the identity of sarcode with the protoplasm of plant and animal cells ; and this discovery was most helpful to Max Schultze in working out his cell theory, and in estab- lishing his theory of pro- toplasm (p. 6). In Amoeba, lymph cells, Mycetozoa, and Reticularia, we have learnt to recognise naked cells; those of plants on the contrary are almost invariably enclosed by a well- defined layer, which is sometimes very thick and firm; this is also very frequently the case with animal cells (membrane, intercel- lular substance), and thus in such cases a little chamber, or cell, in the true sense of the word is formed. Young cells from the neighbourhood of the growing point of a plant, and cartilage cells from a Salaman- der larva, are very good examples of this. The cells at the growing point of a plant (Fig. 12 A), whei'e they multiply very rapidly, are very small, aud are very similar to animal cells. They are only separated from one FxG.lO.-Gromiaov./ornus. (After M. Schultze.) another by very thin / / ,.' list; v.y.-. ?///IM\V L Ã„\\M I \

THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL. 253 bv a number of experiments upon Leucophrys patula, a species of Infusorian, that only after 300 generations have been produced from a fertilised individual does the generation cycle close, the descendants now showing for the first time the inclination and capacity for sexual conjugation. In Onychodromus grand* this Fig. 137.â€”Development of Pondortno morum (after Pringsheim ; from Sachp, Fig. 411): I a swarming colony ; II the same, split up into sixteen daughter-colonies; III a sexual family, through the gelatinous envelope of which the individual cells are passing nut; IV, V conjugation of the swarm-spores; VI a newly-formed zygote; VII a full- grown zygote; VIII transformation of the contents of a zygote into a large swarm- cell ; IX the same, after having been set free; X the young colony derived from the swarm-cell. condition occurs after the 140th generation, and in Stylonichia inislulaia, after the 130th generation. In multicellular organisms the cells, which are produced by the

187 THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELL Third Stage of Division. The third stage is characterised by the division of the single group of mother-Dsegments in the equatorial plane into two groups of daughter-segments, which retreat in opposite directions from one another, until they are situated in the neighbourhood of the two poles of the nuclear figure (Fig. 80 A, B, G). The two A B G Fia. SO.—Diagrammatic representation of nuclear segmentation (after Flemming). The daughter-segments are retreating in two groups towards the poles. (From Hatschek.) daughter-stars are formed, as Flemming expresses it, from the mother-star. The details of the process, which can only be ob- served with difficulty, are as follows :— The daughter-segments, which have been produced by the splitting of a mother-segment, separate from one another at the angle of the loop, which is directed towards the spindle, and com- mence to retreat towards the poles, whilst for a time the ends of the arms of the loop remain undivided. Finally these also split up. From out of the 24 original loops two groups, each contain- ing 24 daughter-loops, have developed; these move towards the centrosomes, until they come quite close to them, when they stop, for they never actually reach the poles themselves. Be- tween these two groups fine "connecting fibrils" stretch; these are probably derived from the spindle fibrils. Each loop, or daughter-segment, has "its angle directed towards the pole, whilst its free ends are turned either obliquely, or per- pendicularly, to the equatorial plane." As might be expected, to start with, they are much thinner than the mother-segments; however, they soon begin to shorten and to become proportion- ately thicker. When the daughter-star is first formed, the segments lie somewhat far apart, but they soon begin to draw

THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELT, 4±D such as are brought about by the fertilisation and the maturation of the ova. -fk Fig. 106.—A Mature Egg of an Echinoderm, containing in its yolk a very small nucleus (e/c)(0. Hertwig, Embryol., Fig. 11). B Egg of a Sea-urchin, immediately after the close of fertilisation. Female pro-nucleus and. male pro-nucleus have united to form the cleavage nucleus (fk), which occupies the centre of a protoplasmic radiation. Polar differentiation consists in this, that the lighter protoplasm collects at one pole, and the heavier yolk substance at the other. They may be more or less sharply separated from one another. For instance, sections through the eggs of Amphibians do not show any striking separation, the only thing being, that in the one half the yolk plates are smaller, and are separated from each other by A. P. V. P. Fig. 108. Fig. 107. Fia. 107.—Diagram of an Egg with the nutritive yolk in a polar position (0. Hertwig, Bmbryel., Fig. 3). Tho formative yolk constitutes at the animal pole (A, P) a germ disc (fc, sch), in which the germinal vesicle (kb) is enclosed. The nutritive yolk (ml) fills the rest of the egg up to the vegetative pole (F, P). Fig. If8.-Egg.cell (yolk) of the Hen, taken from the ovary (0. Hertwig, Embryol., Fig. 6,1): k,sch germinal disc; lcb germinal vesicle; g, d yellow yolk; w,d white yolk; d, h vitelline membrane.

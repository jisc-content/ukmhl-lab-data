THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL 79 as small button-like protuberances, -whilst at their free ends they gradually become reduced to fine points. Ciliary organs may occur in large or small numbers. In the latter case, when only from one to four are present, and when they are generally longer and more powerful, they are called flagella; in the former case, they cover the whole surface of the cell in lai^ge numbers, thousands being frequently present, they are then smaller and more delicate, and are called cilia. a. Cells with Flagella. Flagella occur either at the anterior or posterior end of the body, producing a correspondingly different movement in the body. In the first case the flagella travel forwards, dragging the body along after them ; in the second they propel it from behind. The former mode of locomotion has c Ä B Fig. 41.—.4 Euglena viridis (after Stein): n nucleus; c contractile vacuole; o pigment- spot. B Uexamitas iafiatus (after Stein).

(From Hertwig, Figs. 130-132.) been chiefly observed in Flagellata and kindred organisms (Fig. 44 A, B, C), in many kinds of Bacteria (Fig. 33 b), in antherozoids (Mosses, Ferns, Equisitacete), and in swarmspores, under which name the reproduction bodies of many Algee and Fungi are included; the latter method of locomotion occurs in the spermatozoa of most animals (Fig. 45). The ciliary organs of unicellular organisms have a double

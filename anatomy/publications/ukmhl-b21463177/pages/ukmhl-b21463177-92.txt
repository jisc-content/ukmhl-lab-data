Schnitze.) in a thread, may be foreign bodies which adhere to the thread substance, and have been taken in by it, are seen to join in this movement, the rate of which may attain to "02 mm. per second. Where several threads over- lap each other gran- ules may be seen pass- ins: from one into the other. At such places broad flat surfaces may be produced by the heaping up of the thread substance. A special kind of protoplasmic move- ment is described by Engelmann (III. 5, 7) under the name of gliding movement (Glitschbewegung). It has been observed chiefly in Diatoms and 0sei 11 aria. In the former the proto- plasm is surrounded by a siliceous shell, in the latter by a cellu- lose membrane. How- ever, outside this covering there is an exceedingly delicate layer of hyaloplasm, quite free from gran- ules, which cannot be seen in the living ob-

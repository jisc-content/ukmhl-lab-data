THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELL 221 " Suitably prepared longitudinal and transverse sections of the growing-points of roots and shoots show characteristic cell-wall networks and cell arrangements, which agree with the type, even in the most various plants. This depends essentially upon the fact that the embryonic substance of the growing-point, as it increases in volume on every side and at all parts, becomes divided up into compartments or chambers by cell-walls, which intersect one another at right angles. The longitudinal section of a growing- point always shows a system of periclinal walls, intersected by anticlinal walls, which in their turn represent the right-angled trajectories of the former. If only the growing-points of flat structures be considered, then there will be only two systems of cell-walls present ; if, however, the growing-point is hemispherical or conical, or of some other similar shape, that is to say not flat, but forming a solid mass, a third system of cell-walls must be taken into account; namely, the longitudinal walls, which stretch out in a radial direction from the longitudinal axis of the growing-point." "It will facilitate a clear comprehension of the subject, if before proceeding farther we examine a diagram, which has been constructed arbitrarily, although according to fixed laws, and p * r* X j> Fig. 111.—Diagram of the cell arrangement at. a growing-point. (After Sachs, Fig. 281.) for this purpose it will be well to consider as a starting-point a median longitudinal section through the growing-point (Fig. 111). Confining our attention, therefore, to our figure, of which the out- line E E represents the longitudinal section through a conical growing-point—which resembles fairly closely those met with in nature—it will be seen that it has the form of a parabola and

THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELL 235 IV. Division with Reduction. During the final development of ova and spermatozoa, certain peculiar processes of division occur, which have for their function the preparation of the sexual cells. The essential characteristic of this is, that in the double division that occurs the second follows the first so quickly, that the nucleus has no time to enter the rest- ing condition. The result is, that the groups of nuclear segments produced by the first division are immediately split up into two daughter-groups without previously undergoing longitudinal cleavage. Hence, at the end of the second division, the mature egg- and sperm-cells only contain half the number of nuclear segments, and half as much nuclein substance, as are present in the nuclei produced by ordinary cell division in the same animal (Hertwig VI. 34). To this phenomenon the name of "division with reduction" has been given (Weismann VI. 77). Division with reduction is most easily followed in the sperm- and egg-cells of Ascaris megalocephala. In the testis tube a certain number of cells are differentiated off to form the sperm-mother-cells. In the large vesicular nucleus (Fig. 125 J.), eight long nuclear threads develop out of the 71".

(Ascaris megalocephala hivalens has been selected for description.) These are arranged in two bundles, and are connected with the nuclear membrane by linin threads, which stretch out in every direction. Whilst the nucleolus splits up into separate spherules, two centrosomes, surrounded by a small radiation sphere (Fig. 125 IL), make their appearance near to one another in the protoplasm, close to the outer surface of the The segments then become nuclear membrane (Fig. 125 IL).

THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELL 231 and are thus connected with one another. Soon aftowards a second vertical furrow makes its appearance, crossing the first at ;:ght angles, and terminating in a similar manner atB™* disc, which is now split up into four segments (Figs. U0B,121B). In this case also a cleavage line is formed. A B Fig. 121.-Discoidal cleavage of the egg of a CephalovoA (after Watase; from Hertwig, Fig. 99). Each of the four segments is again halved by a radial furrow. The segments so produced correspond to sectors, whose pointed ends meet in the centre of the germinal disc, and whose broad ends are turned towards the periphery. The pointed ends are separated from the rest of the segment by a diagonal furrow, or by one which is parallel to the equator of the egg-sphere; and in consequence smaller central segments cut off from the yolk in every direction, and larger peripheral portions still connected with the yolk, may be distinguished (Fig. 120 G). From now on, furrows which are radial, and ones which are parallel to the equa- tor, alternately make their appearance, so that the germinal disc becomes more and more split up, the segments being so arranged that the smaller ones are in the centre of the disc, and the larger ones on its circumference (Fig. 121 C). Many of the segments which are still attached to the yolk become constricted, so that the nuclear spindle is slanting or vertical, the consequence of which is, that when division occurs one of the daughter nuclei is situated in the yolk-mass. In this manner the yolk-nuclei are produced by partial cleavage ; an especially large number of them are em- bedded in the superficial layers of yolk on the periphery of the segmented germinal disc. Compare the interesting observations of Rückert (VII. 36), and Oppel (VII. 34), from which it appears that in Selachians and Reptiles yolk-nuclei develop in consequence of over-impregnation.

^ THE CELL After a sufficient number of nuclei have developed, a further stage supervenes, when cells are formed (Fig. 124). Between the nuclei, winch are arranged at regular distances from one another, the protoplasm differen- Hü! tiates itself into radial fibrillar Further it de- velops connecting threads in all directions, which thicken at their centres, and form cell- plates. In the cell-plates the cellulose walls make their appearance in the manner already de- scribed. These swell up easily, and owing to their formation, a portion of the protoplasmic lining becomes encapsuled around each nucleus to form the protoplasm of the cell. Sometimes two nuclei are enclosed in one cell; these sub- l|jpip ID WW Enjffi vhi Fig. 121.—tiesedo odorala. Protoplasmic lining of the embryo-sac at the commencement of free cell- formation, (x 240; after Strasburger, Botuii. Pvaläi- cum, Fig. 192.) sequently are either separated from one another by a partition wall, or, as in Corydalis cava, fuse together to form a single cell. The sporangium of Saprolegnia is, to commence with, a long cell filled with protoplasm. Later on the nuclei in it increase very much in number through bipartitions, which for the most part occur simultaneously. After a time they distribute themselves evenly throughout the cell-space. The protoplasm in the neigh- bourhood of each nucleus then differentiates itself into a small mass, which surrounds itself with a firm glistening envelope; by this means the cell contents split up simultaneously into as many spores as there are small nuclei present in the cell. Later on these are passed to the exterior by the bursting of the mother- cell, the sporangium. The formation of swarm-spores in Radiolaria, which has been already mentioned, affords us another peculiar instance of so- called free cell-formation.

THE CELT, 116 immersed in the water. The strands of protoplasm, which were placed in the non-oxygenated water, were seen to grow gradually thinner, until after a time all the protoplasm had crept up above the layer of oil, which, except in excluding the air, had no deleterious effect upon it, to the upper portion of the cylinder, where it could come into contact with the oxygen of the air. Another method of performing the same experiment is to place a Plasmodium in a cylinder which is quite full of thoroughly boiled water; to close the opening with a perforated cork, and then to place the cylinder upside down in a plate of fresh water. Very soon the plasmodium is seen to have wandered through the small hole in the cork into the medium which contains oxygen. Engelmann (IV. 7) has made some very interesting experiments upon the directing influence exerted by oxygen upon the move- ments of bacteria. He shows that many species of bacteria may be used as a very delicate test for minute quantities of oxygen. If into a fluid which contains certain bacteria, a small alga or diatom is introduced it is seen after a short time to be surrounded with a dense envelope of bacteria, which have been attracted by the oxy- gen set free by the action of its chlorophyll. Verworn (IV. 40) saw a dia- '• torn quite enclosed by a wall of motionless Spirochetal whilst the rest of the preparation was quite free from them (Fig. 58). Suddenly the diatom moved a short distance away, getting out of the crowd of Bacteria. The Spirochete, so suddenly left in the lurch by the producer of oxygen, remained quiet for a second, but soon commenced to move about quickly, and to swim after the diatom in dense masses. After a minute or two they had nearly all reassembled Pia. 58. — a large diatom (Phuudana) round about it, after which they surrounded by a large number of Spiro. reniained motionless as before. ohart« pttNtfOfe (After Verworn iv. 40, attractive power pos- Pig. 14.)

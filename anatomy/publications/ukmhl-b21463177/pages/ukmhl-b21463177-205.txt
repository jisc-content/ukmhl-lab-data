183 THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELL mences The nuclein granules, which are distributed all over the linin framework (Fig. 75 A), collect together at certain places and arrange themselves into delicate spiral threads, which are covered A B Fig 75 -A Resting nucleus of a sperm-mother-cell of Salamandra maeulaia (after Flemming PI 23, Fig. 1; from Hatschek). B Nucleus of a sperm-mother-cell of Sala- viandra maculata. Coil stage. The nuclear threads are already commencing to split longitudinally (diagrammatic, after Flemming, PI. 26, Fig. 1; from Hatschek). with small indentations and swellings. From these, innumerable most delicate fibrils branch off at right angles ; these fibrils, which consist of strands of the linin framework, only become visible as the nuclein withdraws itself from their surface. Later on the nuclein threads become still more clearly defined, and, as the in- dentations and swellings disappear, develop a perfectly smooth sur- face (Fig. 75 B). Now since they surround the nuclear space on every side, they produce an ap- pearance described by Flemming as the coil figure (spirem, skein). The coil is much more dense in the epithelial cells of Salamandra than in sperm cells, whilst at the same time the threads are much finer and longer (Fig. 76). It is as yet undecided, whether at the outset the coil consists of a single long thread or of several such threads. I agree with Rabl (VI. 53) that the latter is more v ' Fig. 76.â€”Nucleus of an epithelial cell probable. at the commencement of division; from A Striking difference is now seen a Salamander larva.

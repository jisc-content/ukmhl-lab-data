ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 47 of their chemical properties have been distinguished above as linin and nuclein, arrange themselves in the form of a more or less fine framework structure. Figs. 23-26 show us examples of the various modifications which may occur. Fig. 23 represents the nucleus of a dlio-flagellate organism. It consists, like the chief nucleus of the Infusoria, of a small-meshed framework of nuclein. Biitschü (II. 5) considered that it is in the form of a small delicate honeycomb • in his opinion the nucleus is composed of extended faviform chambers, with three or more sides, separated from one another by very delicate partition walls of nuclein, and enclosing the nuclear sap, which is only slio-htly affected by staining reagents. Similarly their upper surface's are separated from the protoplasm by means of a delicate layer of nuclein, there being no distinct true nuclear membrane.

Fig. 24.-Nucleus of a connective tissue cell from the peritoneum of a Salamander larva, with central cor puscles lying near it. (After Flemmine Fig. 4.) K' *here the part.fon walls meet are thickened like columns The appearance vanes according to the point of view from which the nucleus is seen, m consequence of the extended form of the flvl chambers, which lie parallel to one another; a glance at ^ B, explains th.s. One or two nucleoli are to be seen in the ca-v tr of a Salamander larva. It consists of a fairly close network ! posed of extremely delicate threads.

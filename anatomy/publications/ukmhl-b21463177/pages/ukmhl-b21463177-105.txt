THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL 83 of their force components, is invariably of minor importance (Hensen III. 11). Fig. 47.-Explanation of the mechanism of the movements of spermatozoa (after Hensen, Pig. 22). A The four phases of position assumed by the border of the flagellum when an undulation passes over it. I to I1, the first; II to II i to II \ the second ; III to IIP to III*, the third; IV to IV1, the fourth stage of the bending of the border in a longi- tudinal undulation.

E Movement of an ordinary sper- matozoon ; a b c various phases of this movement. b. Cells with numerous Cilia. The Infusoria are chiefly to be distinguished from other unicellular organisms by the large number of cilia they possess, on which account they are called Ciliata (Fig. 48). Cilia are much smaller than flagella, be- ing, as a rule, about '1 to "3 p thick, and about 15 fx long. They may number many thousands. For example, it has been calculated, that the Paramcecium aurelia possesses approximately 2,500. As for the Balantidium elongahcm, which is parasitic in the Frog, and which is very thickly ciliated, Bütschli (III. 3) is of opinion that it has nearly ten thousand cilia ; these are generally arranged in several longitudinal rows, which either encircle the body in spirals, or are con- fined to a certain portion of its sur- face. In addition to the cilia, many Infusoria possess special large organs of locomotion, cirri, and undulating membranes.

EDITOR'S PREFACE The translation of Professor Hertwig's book Las been no easy task. The extreme complexity of much of the matter treated, in addition to the large number of subjects referred to, has often rendered it extremely difficult to express the author's meaning in readable English. Of one thing there can be no doubt, and that is, that the subject matter is of very great importance; moreover, it cannot but prove most useful to the student who does not read German fluently, to possess in English so comprehensive an account of the Anatomy and Physiology of the Cell, as the one contained in Professor Hertwig's book. In many cases it has been extremely difficult to find equivalents for terms used in the German. Amongst these the word " Anlage " may be specially mentioned. Various terms have been used by different translators to express the meaning of this word, but none of them seems to be applicable to all cases. Professor Mark has introduced the word "fundament," and Mr. Mitchell has suggested the term " blast," but neither of these appears to express the meaning of the German word sufficiently accurately to justify the use of either of them exclusively. Hence, we thought it best in some cases to employ the somewhat cumbrous expression, " elemental germ," although it is undoubtedly open to objection; however, it frequently seemed to uS to convey the author's idea most correctly. On other occasions we have thought better to make use of a paraphrase. Several additions have been made to the Bibliography of papers

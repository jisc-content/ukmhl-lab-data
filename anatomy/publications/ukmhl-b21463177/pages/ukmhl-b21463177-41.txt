21 ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES the cells of a honeycomb, being in the form of very varying poly- hedra ; they are separated from one another by the most delicate lamella? of oil, which refract the light somewhat more strongly than the watery liquid does. As a result of physical laws, only three lamellae can touch at one edge TT5 alv Fig. 3.—Optical section of the edge of a drop of an emulsion made with olive oil arid salt; the alveolar layer (alv.) is very distinct, and relatively deep. (x 1250 : after Bütschli, PI. IH.,Tig. 4.) Hence it appears in optical section, that only three lines meet in any one point. If before the for- mation of the emulsion fine par- ticles of lamp-black are distributed throughout the oil, these collect at the point of intersection. Finallj, the superficial layer is composed of a delicate froth, the frame- work of which is arranged in a peculiar fashion, the partition walls of oil, which touch the surface, being perpendicular to it, and thus appearing parallel to one another in optical section. Bütschli describes this as the alveolar layer (Fig. 3 alv.). Bütschli considers that the protoplasm of all plant and animal cells (Figs. 4, 5) possesses a structure which is similar to this.

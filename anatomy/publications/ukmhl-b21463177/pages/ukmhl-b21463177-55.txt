ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES Fig. 13). Finally, in other cases, even these strands of protoplasm in the interior of the cell may disappear. Then the protoplasmic substance is represented solely by a thin skin, which lines the interior of the little chamber, to use an expression of Sachs (II. 33), as the paper covers the walls of a room, and which con- tains one single large sap vacuole (Fig. 12 0, left lower cell, and Fig. 59). In very large cells this coating is sometimes so thin that, except for the nucleus, the presence of protoplasm can hardly be demonstrated at all in the cell, even when a high power of the microscope is used, so that special methods of investigation are necessary in order to render it visible. •W*.

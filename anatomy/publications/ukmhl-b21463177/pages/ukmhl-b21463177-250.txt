By this term we understand two or three small spherules, which are composed of protoplasm and nuclear substance, and hence are of the same value as small cells; they are frequently situated at the animal pole of the ess withm the vitelline membrane. The course of the process of cell- budding is as follows :— Whilst the germinal vesicle is becoming broken up, a typical 1 U. IIL IV.

In Fig. I. the polar spindle (sP) has advanced to the surface of the egg In Fig II a small protuberance (rfci) has been formed, which receives half of the spindle. In Fig III. the protuberance is constricted off, forming a polar cell (rfei). Out of the remaining half of the original spindle, a second complete spindle (sp) has developed. In Fig IV a second protuberance has bulged out below the first polar cell, which in Fig. V. becomes constricted off to form the second polar cell (rfc*). In Fig. VI. out of the remainder of the spindle the egg nucleus (eh) develops.

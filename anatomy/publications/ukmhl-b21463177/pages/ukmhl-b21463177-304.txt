As a rule all the cells prepare fo reproduction at the same time by sending out lateral processes to wards each other These fuse at the point of contact" while the eparatrng wall dissolves, and thus transverse canals arc formed which connect the conjngating threads at regular distances, and Fia. m.-Spirogyra longata (after Sachs, Fig. 410). To the left, several cells of two fila- ments, which are about to conjugate: they show the spiral chlorophyll bands, in which crown-like arrangements of starch grains are lying, as well as small drops of oil. The nucleus of each cell is surrounded by protoplasm, from which threads stretch to the cell- wall, b, preparatory to conjugation. To the right, A, cells engaged in conjugation: the protoplasm of the one cell is just passing over into the other at a; in b the two proto- plasmic masses have already united. In B, the young zygotes are surrounded by a wall. resemble the rungs of a ladder (Fig. 153). The protoplasmic- bodies of the cells then contract away from their cellulose wall, and after a time fuse together. Differences which in themselves are trifling, but which on that

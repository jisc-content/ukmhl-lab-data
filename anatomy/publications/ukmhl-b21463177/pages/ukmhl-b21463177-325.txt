THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL 303 rotating on its own longitudinal axis. After this had been going on for several minutes, and had been repeated with several fixed individuals one after the other, the bud at last attached itself to one of them, generally at the aboral end, near the stalk. After a few minutes the fusion might be definitely observed to be taking place." In connection with the above-mentioned description, Engelmann remarks: " At another time I observed a still more striking physiological or even psychophysiological exhibition. A free bud crossed the path of a large Vorticella, which was travelling with great rapidity through the drop, and which had abandoned its stalk in the usual manner. At the moment of meeting, although there was absolutely no contact, the bud suddenly changed its course, and followed the Vorticella with the greatest rapidity; then a regular chase ensued, which lasted for about five seconds. During this time the bud kept at a distance of about ^T mm. behind the Vorticella; however, it did not succeed in overtakiug it, but lost it in consequence of its making a sudden side move- ment. Hereupon the bud continued its path at its original slower pace." This phenomenon of influence exerted at a distance has also been observed by Fol (VI. 19 a) in animal cells, snch as the ova of the Star-fish. Bach ovum is surrounded by a thin gelatinous envelope. When fresh spermatozoa of the same species approach the surface of the envelope, the one which is most in advance exercises a distinctly perceptible influence upon the yolk (Fig. 160). A Fig. 160.â€”A, B, C Sections of ova of Asterias glaoialie, after Fol. The spermatozoa have already penetrated the gelatinous envelopes of the ovum. In A, a prominence is just beginning to rise up to meet the most advanced spermatozoon. In B, the promin- ence and spermatozoon have met. In C, the spermatozoon has penetrated the egg which has formed a yolk-membrane with a crater-like aperture.

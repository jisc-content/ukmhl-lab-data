325 METABOLIC CHANGES no definite position. In other cases, however, its position is fixed." I will cite a few especially instructive examples from the numerous observations, on which Haberlandt has based his laws. The epidermal cells of many plants often exhibit thickenings on the surface of their walls; this may occur either on those pointing outwards or on those pointing inwards. The nucleus here lie°s near to the one in which the thickening occurs, being always close to the middle of the latter. The examples given in Fig. 161 show this very distinctly: No. I., a row of cells from the epidermis of a foliage-leaf of Gypripedium insigne; No. III. an epidermal cell of the fruit-scale of Carex panicea, and No. IV. a young epidermal cell of a foliage-leaf of Aloe verrucosa. A second series of investigations have been made upon the development of plant- hairs, growing both above and below ground. II 111 IV \\ Fig. 161. pra. 162.

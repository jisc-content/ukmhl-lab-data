38 THE CELL frequently richer in water than protoplasm is, it may be dis- tinguished from the latter even in the living cell, appearing as a bright spot with indistinct outlines, or as a vesicle or vacuole. But this is not always the case. In many objects, such as lymph corpuscles, corneal cells, and the epithelial cells of gills of Sala- mander larvae, no nuclei can be distinguished during life, although they immediately become visible when coagulation, induced either by the death of the cell, or by the addition of distilled water or weak acids, occurs. In many kinds of cells, and in the lower organisms, the nucleus may assume very various shapes. Sometimes it is in the shape of a horse-shoe (many Infusoria), sometimes of a more or less twisted Fig. 18.â€”(After Paul Mayer, from Korschelt, Fig. 12.)

This latter form chiefly appears in the large gland-cells of many insects (in the Malpighian tubes, in the spinning and salivary glands, etc.), and similarly in the gland-cells of the crustacean Phronima. The size to which the nucleus attains is generally proportional to the size of the mass of protoplasm surrounding it; the larger this is, the larger is the nucleus. Thus, in the great ganglionic

36 THE CELL a piece of masonry (Fig. 16) ; if a section be made of an egg, the protoplasm is seen to be present in the form of a delicate net- work, in the larger and smaller meshes of which these reserve substances are deposited. The only place where it is collected together into a thick, cohesive layer is on the surface of the egg, and in the neighbourhood of the nucleus. Another good example of a protoplasmic framework structure, caused by the deposition of various substances, is afforded us by the mucous cells of vertebrates (Fig. 17) and invertebrates. The section varies according as to whether it is taken from the epithelial surface, or from the base of the goblet. In the former case it is wider, and is seen to consist chiefly of homogeneous shining secretion, the mucilaginous substance, which is evacuated Fig. 16.—An egg of Ascaris megalocephala.

The protoplasm traverses the mass of secretion in the form of fine threads, which join together to make a wide meshed network, only forming a compact body at the lower extremity of the cell, in which also the nucleus is situated. II. The Chemico-physical and Morphological Properties of the Nucleus. The nucleus is quite as important as the protoplasm in the economy of the cell. It was first discovered, in 1833, by Robert Brown (I. 5), in plant-cells ; soon afterwards Schleiden (I. 28) and Schwann (I. 31) made it the foundation stone of their theory of cell formation ; after that the study of the nucleus remained for some time in the background, as the

;*60 THE CELL fcteindmdoal in question are represented; therefore, the nucleus is the organ of heredity; the remaining protoplasm of the cell contains practically only those idioblasts which have become active m it and which can multiply rapidly in an adequate man- ner. We have, therefore, to distinguish between two modes of multiplication of the idioblasts; the one referring to all of them, winch results in nuclear division and in their equal distribution amongst the two daughter cells ; and the other, which to a certain extent, is a multiplication connected with function ; and this latter only affects those idioblasts which have become active; moreover, it is connected with the material changes which occur in them and it takes place chiefly in the protoplasm, outside the nucleus. This conception is another indication that the protoplasm is composed of small elementary units of substance, as has been assumed latterly by several investigators, who have started various theories ; as for instance Altmann (II. 1), in his theory of bio- blasts, and Wiesner (IX. 35), in his recent work 11 Die Elementar- structur und das Wachslhum der lebenden Substanz" The proto- plasm, like the nucleus, consists of a large number of small particles of material, which differ as to their chemical composition, and which have the power of assimilating material, of growing and of multiplying by division. (Omne granuhtm e granulo, as Altmann expresses it.) Material for growth is supplied by the fluid, which bathes the nucleus and protoplasm, and in which plastic materials of the most different kinds (albumen, fats, carbo- hydrates, salts) are dissolved. â€¢ In order to distinguish the idioblasts of the nucleus from those of the protoplasm, we will call the latter " plasomes," a name which has been used by Wiesner. As the plasomes (or as it were the active idioblasts) are, accord- ing to the theory of " intracellular pangenesis," supposed to be derived from the idioblasts of the nucleus, so they may also form the starting-point of the organic products of the plasma, since according to their specific characters, they join to themselves various substances; for instance, certain kinds of plasomes, by combining with carbo-hydrates, might produce the cellulose mem- brane, or by combining with starch the starch granules; hence they might be designated, the cell-membrane formers or starch formers. Thus the most different occurrences in cell life may be regarded, from a common point of view, as vital processes taking place in

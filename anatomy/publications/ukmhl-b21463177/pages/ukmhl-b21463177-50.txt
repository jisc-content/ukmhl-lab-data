THE CELL 28 Very similar in appearance to the Amoeba, but much smaller in size, are the white blood corpuscles avd the lymph corpuscles of the vertebrates (Fig. 8). If they are examined just after they have been taken from the body of the living animal, they are seen to be more or less globular masses of protoplasm, each one consisting of a scarcely visible hyaline layer, enclosing a granular internal portion iu which the nucleus is situated. However, whilst the specimen is fresh, this nucleus can hardly be distinguished, and sometimes even is quite invisible. After a time, the little body begins to push out from its surface, processes similar to the pseudo- podia of the Amoeba. Fig. 7. Fig. 8. Fig. 7.—Amceba proteiis (after Leidy: from R. Hertwig, Fig. 16): n nucleus; cv con- tractile vacuole ; n food vacuoles ; en endoplasm ; efc ectoplasm.

The two figures re- present two successive changes of shape in the same cell. (Aiter Metschnikoff, Fig. 64.) Myxomycetes and Reticulata, which also consist of naked proto- plasm, are very different in appearance. The Myxomycete, which is best known to us, is the JEthalium septicum, which forms the so-called flowers of tan and grows over large portions of the surface of tan-pits, during its vegetative condition, like a thin coherent skin of protoplasm (plasmodium). Chondrioderma is another slime fungus which is nearly allied to the above. A small piece of its edge is represented in Fig. 9.

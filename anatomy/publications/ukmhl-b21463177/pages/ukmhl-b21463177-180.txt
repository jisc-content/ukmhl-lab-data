L58 THE CELL drops, when a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium is added to them, acquire a mahogany-brown coloration, by means of which they can be easily seen. Mucigenous substances often fill up the interior of the cells, by which they are secreted (Fig. 64) in such quantities that the cells swell up into vesicles, or assume the form of goblets. The greater part of the protoplasm is collected at the base of the cell, where the nucleus also is situated, whilst the remainder surrounds the mucigenous substance with a thin envelope, and extends into it a few threads which unite together to form a net. The mucigenous substances cau be clearly distinguished from protoplasm when the cell is stained with one of several aniline dyes. The internal plasmic products very frequently acquire greater solidity in egg-cells, which are loaded in the most various ways with reserve materials. These ;u t> grouped according to their form as yolk-globules (Fig. 65), yolk granules, and yolk lamellae, and from a chemical point of view chiefly consist of a mixture of albuminates and fats. The more numerous, small, and closely packed these yolk-elements are, the more the plasmic body assumes a foamy or net-like ap- pearance.

Many plasmic products are crystalline in character, such as the guanin crystals, to which the glistening silvery appearance in the skin and peritoneum of fishes is due, or as the pigment granules in the pigment cells. Plasmic products, similar to those in animal cells, occur also in plant cells; however, in this case they are generally present in a tew special organs, which are utilised either for the storing up of reserve material, or, as with seeds, for purposes of reproduction.

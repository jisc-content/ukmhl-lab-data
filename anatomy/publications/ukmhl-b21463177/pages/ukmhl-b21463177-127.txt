105 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL investigation of Stahl (IV. 34), which he conducted on the lines laid down by Famintzin, Frank, and Borodin. When the illumina- tion is faint, or when the leaves are in shadow, the protoplasm moves so that the chlorophyll granules are arranged upon those external surfaces of the cells which are turned towards the lio-ht (Fig. 524), having completely forsaken the side-walls. On the other hand, the protoplasm, under the influence of direct sunlight, streams away towards the side-walls, until the external surface is quite free from chlorophyll granules, that is to say, in the first case, the whole cMorophyll-bearing substance, as in Uesocarvu, assumes a surface position towards the impinging Iiu-ht .Z* srmnrl a -j.- i """puging ngnt, and m the second, a p10file position; hence the varying colour of the leaves.

ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 41 as a rule, towards the staining substance united to it, like a weakly alkaline body " (Fol). Further, nuolein exhibits characteristic chemical reactions, which must not be forgotten in preparing nuclear structures for preservation (Schwarz II. 37, Zacharias II. 43, 45). It swells up m distilled water, in very dilute alkaline solutions, and in 2 or more per cent, solution of common salt, of sulphate of magnesia, or of monopotassium phosphate and of lime-water. If solutions of from 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, of the above-named salts are used, the nuclein, whilst swelling gradually, becomes quite dis- solved. Similarly, it dissolves completely in a mixture of ferro- cyamde of potassium and acetic acid, or in concentrated hydrochloric acid, or if it is subjected to pancreatic digestion. It becomes pre- cipitated in a fairly unaltered form if treated with acetic acid from 1 to 50 per cent, in strength, when it can be very clearly distinguished from the protoplasm by its greater refractive power and by a glistening appearance which is peculiar to it.

For instance, they only store up very small quantities of common salt, of which about 3 per cent, is present in the water, whilst, on the contrary, they take up relatively large amounts of potassium, magnesium, and calcium salts, of which there are only traces. And in a similar manner, the analysis of the ashes of different land-plants which have flourished side by side in the same earth yields very different results. Investigation of the metabolism occurring in the animal body leads to the same conclusion. Only certain cells have the tendency to take possession of the lime-salts, which are present in almost inappreciable amounts in the fluids of the body, and to deposit them in the osseous tissues ; other groups of cells, such as those in the kidneys, take up the substances from the blood, and excrete them in the form of urine; others store up fat, etc., etc. The factors concerned in this absorption and non-absorption of matter are at present quite beyond our comprehension. It is curious that the need which is evinced by the economy of a cell for a certain substance does not always imply that this will be taken up. Cells may absorb materials which are either directly hurtful or completely useless to them. In this respect the very different ways in which living plant cells take up aniline dyes are very instructive (Pfeffer V. 22b). Although solutions of methylene blue, methyl violet, cyanin, Bismark brown, fuchsine and safranin, are absorbed, those of nigrosin, aniline blue, methyl blue, eosin, and congo-red, are not.

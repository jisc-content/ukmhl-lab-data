XL, Fig. 6). threads, which, in the dividing sperm-mother-cells of Ascaris ex- tend between the separating nuclear segments, are derived from the linin framework. I was not able to observe a typical spindle development in this object. Another point under discussion is the origin of the centrosome*. These were first described and depicted at the commencement of the year 1870, but they were only brought into prominence as a distinct component part of the nuclear division figure by van Beneden (VI. 4a), when he succeeded in differentiating them clearly from their environment by means of a staining solution of aniline dyes dissolved in 33 per cent, glycerine solution. Soon afterwards both van Beneden and Boveri made simultaneously and independently of each other (VI. 4b, 6) the important discovery, that ceutrosomes multiply by self-division ; later on I was able to verify this statement for the sperm cells of Ascaris (VI. 34). Van Beneden came to the following conclusion as a result of his observations : that the centrosomes, like nuclei, are permanent organs of the cell, and must therefore always occur in the proto- plasm as independent forms. This view was supported to a certain extent by the discoveries of Flemming (VI. 17), Solger (VI. 70), and Heidenhain (II. 16), who stated that in many kinds of cells, such as lymph corpuscles and pigment cells, a centrosome with a radiation sphere may be demonstrated in the protoplasm, even when the nucleus, which is frequently situated some little distance off, is completely at rest.

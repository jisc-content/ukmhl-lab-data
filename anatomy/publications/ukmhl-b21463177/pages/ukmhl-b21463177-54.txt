THE CELL 32 another, and in addition they unite together on the surface to form, a continuous layer (primordial utricle), which adheres closely to the inner surface of the enlarged and thickened cellulose membrane. Two different conditions which are found in the fully grown plant cell are the result of this P A. ' arrangement. Through the fur- ther increase of the cell-sap, the vacuoles are en- B Fig. 12.—Parenchyma cells from the cortical layer of the root of Fritillariaimperialis (longitudinal sections, x 660: after Sachs II. 33, Pig. 75): A very young cells, as yet without cell-sap, from close to the apex of the root; B cells of the same description, about 2 mm. above the apex of the root; the cell- sap (o) forms in the protoplasm (p) separate drops between which are partition walls of protoplasm; C cells of the same description, about 7-8 mm. above the apex; the two lower cells on the right hand side are seen ia a front view; the large cell on the left hand side is seen in optical section ; the npper right hand cell is opened by the section; the nucleus (ay) has a peculiar appearance, in consequence of its being dis- tended, owing to the absorption of water; k nucleus; fcfc nu- cleolus ; h membrane. larged, and the partition wall at- tenuated. Finally the latter par- tially breaks down, so that the separate spaces are connected by openings, and thus form one continuous vacu- ole.

1 290 THE CELL into a bundle of from sixteen to thirty-two spermatozoids (Fig. 158 ill ). They are " extended bodies, bearing anteriorly two cilia, the original green colour of which has been transformed into yellow." The individual bundles separate from the mother-colony, and swim about in the water. «If they meet a female colony, the cilia on both sides become entangled; by this means the male colony is fixed; it however soon falls to pieces, after which the individual spermatozoids, which become considerably longer, bore their way into the gelatinous vesicle of the female colony. They then make their way to the egg-cells, to which, after they have crept round them, they attach themselves, often in great numbers. We may assume that, as has been observed in many other cases, one of these spermatozoids makes its way into each egg-cell " (Sachs). 0 % \\ Fig. 159.—VoJt'0.1' glubator, sexual, hermaphrodite colony, somewhat diagrammatic repre- sentation constructed from figures by Cienkovsky and Biitschli (after Lang, Fig. 21): s male gamete (spermatozoid); 0 female gametes (eggs). Finally, in Volvox globator (Fig. 159) the differentiation is greater than ever, for amongst the very numerous cells which constitute the globular colony some remain vegetative, whilst others become transformed into sexual cells. Further the eggs (0) are still larger than in Eudorina, and are fertilised by very small male elements (s), which swim about with two flagella. If we take all these numerous facts into account, we may surely consider the following law as established, i.e. that egg and sperm- cells are derived from reproductive cells, which, to start with, are similar and not to be distinguished from one another, but which become differentiated by developing in opposite directions. II. The Physiology of the Process of Fertilisation. Having discussed the morphological phenomena which have been

Fio. 140.—A Fertilised egg of a Sea-urchin (O. Hartwig, Embryology, Fig. 18). The head of the spermatozoon, which has penetrated into the egg, has been converted into a sperm-nucleus (sit) surrounded by a protoplasmic radiation, and has approached the egg- nucleus (cfc). B Fertilised egg of a Sea-urchin (O. Hertwig, Embryology, Fig. 19). The sperm-nucleus (s/c) and the egg-nucleus (cfc) have approached each other, and are both surrounded by a protoplasmic radiation. An interesting phenomenon now commences to attract attention (Fig. 140 A, B). The egg- and sperm-nuclei (male and female pro-nuclei) mutually attract each other, as it were simultaneously, and travel through the yolk towards each other with increasing velocity; the sperm-nucleus (sk) with its radiation containing the centrosome always moving in front of it, travels more quickly than the egg-nucleus (eA) with its ovo-centrum.

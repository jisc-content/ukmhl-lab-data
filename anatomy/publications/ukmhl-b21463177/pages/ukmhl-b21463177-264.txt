The most striking of the phenomena described above is the sudden appearance of the four pole radiations, for which, accord- mg to our present knowledge, an equal number of centrosomes must have served as bases. An explanation of this is afforded us by the processes connected with the fertilisation of the Echinoderm egg, which are discussed on p. 259. Modifications of the form of nuclear transformation, shown in *ig. 129 G, occur not infrequently; these are due to one of the radiations being somewhat separated from the three others (Fig. 1.30). In this case the three that are situated close to one another \'II!//a ■ Wttlf// Fig. 130.

In the centre of the equilateral triangle thus formed, the three nuclear planes intersect, producing another regular figure. The fourth radiation, which is situated at one side, is connected by a single spindle with the radiation nearest to it. Fig. 131 may be regarded as an intermediate stage between Figs. 129 and 130. Here the radiation sc, which lies somewhat

ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL ÄND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 17 Proteids are the most complex of all known organic substances, but up till now very little has been determined as to their chemical structure. This complex structure depends, in the first place, upon the very remarkable chemical properties of carbon (Haeckel II. 15). In proteids carbon occurs combined with four other elements, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, in proportions which', it has been endeavoured to express by the following formula : C72 H106N18SO'-2 (composition of a molecule of egg-albumen). Amongst the various kinds of proteid bodies (albumins, globu- lins, fibrins, plastins, nucleins, etc.) plastin alone seems to be pecu liar to protoplasm (Reinke H. 32; Schwarz II. 37; Zacharias 11. 44) ; plastin is insoluble in water, in 10 per cent, salt solution and in 10 per cent, solution of sulphate of magnesia; it is pre- dpitated by weak acetic acid, whilst concentrated acetic acid causes ,fc to swell up; it is precipitated in concentrated salt solution; it resists both pepsin and trypsin digestion. It is hardly or not at all, stained by basic aniline dyes, but is stained by acid ones (eosm and acid fuchsine).

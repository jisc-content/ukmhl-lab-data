65 CHAPTER III. THE VITAL PKOPEBTIES OP THE CELL. I. The Phenomena of Movement. All the mysteries of life, which are exhibited by plants and animals, are present as it were in a rudimentary form, in the simple cell. Each individual cell, like the whole complex organism, has an independent life of its own. If we wish to study more deeply the true nature of protoplasm, we must above all things investigate its most important properties, its so-called vital properties. However, life, even the life of the simplest elementary organism, is a most complex phenomenon, which it is most difficult to define ; it manifests itself, to use a wide generalisation, in this, that the cell in conse- quence of its own organisation, and under the influence of It, environment experiences continual changes and develops powers by means of which its organic substance is being continually broken down and built up again. During the Wer pTee s energy is set free. The whole vital proces? n„ /r PIocess' /Tv t >\ • |Jiocess, as Ulaude Bernard (IV.

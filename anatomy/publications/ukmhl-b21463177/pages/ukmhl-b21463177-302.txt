280 THE CELL durrag the whole of the resting period. It is not until the spring, when a new vegetative period recommences, that the nuclei come close together, and fuse to form a germinal nucleus At tins period the zygote, which is surrounded by a delicate membrane, makes its way through the old cellulose wall, wh√º its germinal nucleus transforms itself into a large spindle of somewhat unusual appearance (Fig. 151 I). This divides into two hal -spindles (Fig. 151 II), which, however, do not enter into the resting condition, but immediately prepare to divide again in. ir. o ,15N1-~Various germinal stages of Closterium. (After Klebahn, PI. XIII., Figs. 6b, 8 (Fig. 151 III). Thus the germinal nucleus divides into four nuclei, by means of two divisions, the second of which succeeds the first without a pause (Fig. 151 IV). Meanwhile the protoplasm of the zygote has divided into two hemispheres (Fig. 151 IV), each of which contains two nuclei, which have been produced by the division of one spindle. The two nuclei soon develop differences in appearance, the one (ac- cording to Klebahn, the large nucleus) becoming large and vesi- cular, whilst the other (the small nucleus) remains small, and finally quite disappears. The small nucleus becomes much more intensely stained than the large one. It seems to me that the former disintegrates and dissolves, just like the fragments of the chief nucleus and the subsidiary spindles in Infusoria. Before

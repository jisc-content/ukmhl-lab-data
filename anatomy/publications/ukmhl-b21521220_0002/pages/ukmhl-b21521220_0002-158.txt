116 Part I. OF THE SKELETON. internal fide of this thin plate, a crofs ridge, placed on fuch another of the maxillary bone, is extended ; on it the back- part of the os fpongiofum inferins refts. Along the outfule of this plate, the perpendicular fofla made by the palate-uervc is obftrvable. At the upper part of this nafal plate, the palate bene di- vides into /wo procejft's, which 1 have already named orlitar ; betvi'een which and the body of the fphenoid bene, that hole is formed which I mentioned as the lall of the holes common to the fphenoid bone. Sometimes this hole is ■wholly formed in the os palati, by a crofs plate going from the one orbitar procefs to the other. A nerve, artery, and vein, belonging to the noftrils, pafs here.—'The anterior of the two orbitar procefles is the larged, and has its fore- part contiguous to the back-part of the maxillary finus, and its upper furface appears in the bottom of the orbit, behind the back-part of the os maxillare and planum. It has cells behind, refembling thofe of the ethmoid bone, to which it is contiguous ; it is placed on the aperture of the finus fphenoidalis, fo as to leave only a round hole at its upper fore-part. The other part of the orbitar procefs is extended along the Internal fide of the upper back-part of the maxillary tuberofity, the bafe of the fphenoid bone, between the root of the procefius azygos and the pterygoid procefs. The palate fquare part of this plate-bone, and its pterygoid procefs, are firm and ftrong, with fome cancelli j but the nafal plate and orbitar procefles are very thin and brittle. The palate-bones are joined to the maxillary, by the fore- edge of the palate fquare bone, by the tranfverfe palate fu- ture : By their thin nafal plates, and part of their or- bitar procefles, to the fame bones, by the palato-maxlllarcs futures:—By their pterygoid procefles, and back-part of the nafal plates, to the alae vefpertilionum, by the fphe- noid I

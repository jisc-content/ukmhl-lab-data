50 Part h OF THE BONES heat and a£Hon of the body, more eafily do, than when it'efcapcs through the compafl fubftance of the bones in a fkeletqn: If, I fay, this oil is fent to a joint, and is incor- porated with the mucilage, and with the fine lymph that is conllantly oozirig out at the extremities of the fmall ar- teries dillributed to the ligaments, one of the fittefl. lini- ments imaginable mull be produced; for the mucus di- luted by the lymph contributes greatly to its lubricity, and , the oil preferves it from hardening. How well fuch a mix- ture ferves the purpofe it is defigned for, Boyle («) tells us he experienced in working his air-pump *, for the fucker could be moved with much lefs force after being moiften- ed with water and oil, than when he ufed either of thefe liquors fingly. And I believe every one, at firft view, will allow the diluted mucilage to be much preferable to fimple water. The fynovia (x), as this liquor compofed of oil, mucilage, and lymph, is commonly now called, while in a found ftate, elFeftually preferves all the parts concerned in the ar'Jrulations foft and flexible, and makes them Aide , eafily on each other, by which their mutual detrition and overheating is prevented, in the manner daily pra£tifed in coach and cart wheels by befmearin^ them with greafe and tar. ^ x\fter the liquor of the articulations becomes too thin and unferviceable, by being conllantly pounded and rub- bed between the moving bones, it is reaflumed into the mafs of blood by the abforbent veflels. When the fynovia is not rubbed betwixt the bones, it infpiflates. And fometimcs, when the head of bone has been long out of its cavity, this liquor is faid to fill up the plac'e of the bone, and hinder its redu£lion; or if a joint * continues long unmoved, it is alfo faid to cement the bones, and (w) Phyfico-mechanlc. experim.

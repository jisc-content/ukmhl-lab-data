OF THE SKELETON. Ji64 Parti This bone confifls of four pieces in people of middle age : —In children, almofh the whole of it is cartilage : In old fub- jeiEIs, all the bones are united, and become frequently one continued bone with the os facrum. The higheft of the four bones is tlie largefl, with fhoul- tlers extended farther to each Tide than the end of the os facrum; which enlargement fhould, in my opinion, ferve as a dillinguiniing mark to fix the limits of either bone *, and therefore fliould take away all difpute about reckoning the number of bones, of wliich one or other of thefe two parts of the falfe vertebrae is compofed ; which difpute muft ftill be kept up, as long as the numbering five or fix bones in the os facrum depends upon the uncertain accident of this broad fliouldered little bone being united to or fepara- ted from it.—The upper furface of this bone is a little hol- low. From the back of that bulbous part, called its ihoulders, a procefs often rifes up on each fide, to join with the bifurcated fpine of the fourth and fifth bones of the os facrum, to form the bony bridge mentioned iir the deferip- tion of the os facrum.—Sometimes thefe flioulders are join- ed to the fidcs of the fifth bone of the os fiicrum, to form the hole in each fide coinmon to thefe two bones, for the paffage of the twenty-ninth pair of fpinal nerves.—Immedi- ately below the fltoulders of the os coccygis, a notch may be remarked on each fide, where the tliirtieth pair of the fpiiKil nerves pafles. The lower end of this bone itf formed ii^ a fmall head,, which very often is hollow in the midille*-^ Tlie three lower bones gradually become fmaller, and are fpongy j but are drengthened by a drong ligament which covers and connttfls thern. 1 heir ends, by which they ;v,re articulated, are formed in the fame manner as thofe o^ the firft bone are. d3etween each of tliefe four bor.es of young fubjedls a cartilage

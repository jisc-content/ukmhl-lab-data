I Chap. I. IN GENERAL. 27 ged to fuppoit, or to the application of any other external force. Several anatomifls (q) thouglit that the eptphyfes ferve other purpofes; fuch as I'ecuring the ligaments of the arti- culations which rife out from between the bones'and them ; for, as foon as thefe parts are intimately joined, the liga- ments infinuated betwixt them muft have a much ftronger conneclion than they could have to the fmcoth furface of the bones. Such an interception of the ligament between the body of the bone and its epiphyfc is not to be feen ; but, the adhefion of the periofteum and ligaments to bones being always ftronger in proportion to the fimilarity of their confiftence, and the bones remaining longer foft, or of a ' fimilar confiftence with ligaments, at thefe places than any where elfe, the .opinion of thefe writers, concerning the ftronger conneclion pf the ligaments where the bones and epiphyfes join, is not without fome foundation. roflibly too, by the fibres of epiphyfes not extending' themfelves fo longitudinally as thofe of the bones, thcrer may be lefs chance of the former running into each other than of the latter. The foftnefs of the ends of bones may be of fome advan- tage in the womb and in parturition; after which the offifi- , cation begins at different points to form epiphyfes, before the offification can extend from the middle to the ends of the bones (r).

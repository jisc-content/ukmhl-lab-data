Chap.II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. i8i The ribs then are artimlated at each end, of which the one behind is doubly joined to the vertebrae ; for the head is received into the cavities of two bodies of tlie vertebra?, and the larger tubercle is received into the depreflion in tlie tranfverfe procefs of the lower vertebra. When w'c examine the double articulation, we muft immediately fee that no other motion can be allowed here than upwards and downwards; fince the tranfverfe procefs hinders the rib to be thvuft hack ; the refiftance on the other fide of the flernum prevents the ribs coming forward; and each of the two joints, with the other parts attached, oppofe its turning round. But then it is likewife as evident, that even the motion upwards and downtyards can be but fmall in any one rib at the articulation itfelf. But as the ribs advance forwards, tlie difiance from their center of motion increafing, the motion muft be larger ; and it would be very confpicuous at their anterior ends, w'ere they not re- fifted there by the cartilages, wliich yield fo little, that the principal motion is performed by the middle part of the ribs, which turns outwards and upwards, and occafions the twift remarkable in'the long ribs at the place near their fore- .end w’here they are moft refifted (r). ^ Hitherto I have laid down the ftruffure and coune£lion / which moft of the ribs enjoy, as belonging to all of them ; but muft now confider the fpecialities wdierein any of them differ from the general defeription given, or from each o- ther. In viewing the ribs from above downwards, their figure is ftill ftraighter; the uppermoft being the moft crooked of any Their obliquity in refpedb of the fpine increafes as they defeend; fo that though their diftances from each other is very little different at their back-part, yet at their fore- ends the diftances betw'een the lower ones • muft increafe. —In (r) Winflow, Mempires de I’acad. des fciences, 1730.

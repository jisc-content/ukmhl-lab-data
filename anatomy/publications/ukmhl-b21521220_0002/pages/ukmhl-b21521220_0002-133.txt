BONES. OF THE FIE AD. 91 Chap. II. formation of the internal orbitar holes; as was remarked in the defcription of the frontal bones. Below the cells of each fide, a thin plate is extended jnv/ards; and then bending down, it becomes thick and of a fpongy texture. This fpongy part is triangular, with a ftraight upper edge placed horizontally, an anterior one flantin’g from above, downwards and forwards, and with a pendulous convex one below. The upper and lower edges terminate in a fliarp point behind. The fide of this pendu- lous fpongy part next to the feptum narium is convex, and its external fide is concave. Thefe two procelTes of the ethmoid bone have got the name of ojfa fporgiofa, or iiir- binata fuperiora^ from their fubllance, figure, and fitua- tion. All the prominences, cavities, and meanders of this eth- moid bone, are covered with a continuation of the mem- brane of the noftrils in a recent fubjeft. Its horizontal cri- briform is lodged between tlie orbitar procefles of the frontal bone, to which it is joined by the ethmoid future, except at the back part, where it is conne£l;ed with the cu- neiform bone by a future common to both thefe bones, though it is generally efteemed part of the fphenoidal Where the ofla plana are contiguous to the frontal bone within the orbit, their conjundlion is reckoned part of the tranfverfe future. Farther forward than the ofla plana, the cells are covered by the ofla unguis: which are not only contiguous to thefe cells, but cannot be feparated from them without breaking the bony fubftance; and therefore, in propriety, thofc bones ought to be demon- ftrated as part of the ethmoid bone.—'. .Below the oflh unguis and plana, thefe cells and olTa fpongiofa are over- lapped by the maxillary bones. The cellular part of each palate bone is contiguous to each os planum, and to the cells backwards. The lower edge of the nafal perpendicular pl^te M2 IS

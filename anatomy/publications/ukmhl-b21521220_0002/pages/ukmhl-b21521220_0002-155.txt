Do not ma- ny phenomena of fmelling, inflammations of thefe parts^ megrim, polypi, &c. depend on this ftru£iure of the men- branes ? The fubjlance of the oflii maxillaria Is compa£l and firm, except at the inferior procefl'es, in which the teeth are lodged, where it Is very fpongy. The maxillary bones are joined above, by the upper ends of their nafal procefl'es to the os frontis, by the tranfverfe future ;—at the fides of thefe procefl'es, to the oflir unguis, by the lacrymal futures ; to the nafal bones, by the late- ral nafal futures ; by their orbitar procefl'es, to the cheek- bones, by the external orbitar future; by the internal fides of the internal orbitar procefl'es, to the olTa plana, by part of the ethmoidal future ; by the back part of the tuberofities, to the palate-bones, by the futurse palato- niaxillares;—by the pofterior edges of their palatine lamel- Ite, to the olTa palati, by the tranfverfe palate future ;—by their nafal fpines, to the vomer, by the fpinous future ; by their focket, to, the teeth, by the gomphofis by the in- ternal edge of the palate-plate, to one another, by the lon- gitudinal palate future, on the upper and fore-part of which a furrow is left for receiving the cartilage which forms the partition of the nollrils ;—between the fore pare of the noflrils and mouth, to each other, by the myfta- chial future fomecimes they are connedted to the oflh fpongiofa inferlora, by a plain concretion or union of fub- ftance. Thefe bones form the greater part of the nofe and of the roof of the mouth, and a confiderable fliare of the VoL. I. P orbit/

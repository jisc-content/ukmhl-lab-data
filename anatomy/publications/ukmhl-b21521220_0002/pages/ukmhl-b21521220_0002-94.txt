Part L 52 OF THE SKELETON. CHAP. II. \ Of the S K E L E T O N. ■ THough any dry fubdance may be called Jkeleton, yet, among anatomifts, this word is univerfally under- ftood to fignify the bones of animals conne£l:ed together, after the teguments, mufcles, bowels, glands, nerves, and veflels, are taken away (a). A Ikeleton is faid to be a natural one when the bones are kept together by their own ligaments ; and it is called artificial when the bones arc joined with wire, or any other fubftance which is not part of the creature to which they belonged. Small fubje£ls, and fucli whofe bones are not fully offified, are commonly prepared the firft way; becaufe, were all their parts divided, the niceft artifl could not’ rejoin them, by reafon of their fmallnefs, and of the reparation of their unoflified parts; whereas the bones of large adult ‘ animals are fooneft and moll conveniently cleaned when fingle, and are eafily refliored to and kept in their natural fitiiation. Sometimes the Ikeleton of the fame animal is prepared in both thefe ways; that is, the fmaller bones are kept together by their natural ligaments, and the larger ones are conne£led by wires or fome fuch fubftances. Before we proceed to the divifion and particular defcrip- tion of the Ikeleton, it is to be obferved, that, when the bones are put into their natural fituation, fcarce any one of them is placed in a perpendicular bearing to another; though the fabric compofed of them is fo contrived, that, in an ere£l pofture, a perpendicular line, for their com- mon centre of gravity, falls in the middle of their com- (a) Cadaveris crates. mon

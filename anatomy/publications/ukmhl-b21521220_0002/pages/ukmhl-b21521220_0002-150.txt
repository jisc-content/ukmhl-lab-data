OF THE SKELETON. Part I. io8 ture; by the edge between the internal and inferior orbitar procefles, to the maxillary bone, by the internal orbitar fu- ture ; by the fide between the maxillary and inferior orbitar procefs, again to the maxillary bone, by the external obitar future; by the zygomatic procefs, to the os temporum, by the zygomatic future. The cheek-bones are entire, and fully ofTified in all their parts* in infants. OSSA MAXILLARIA SUPERIORA. Ossa Maxillaria Superiora are the largeft bones, and Â«onftitute the far greater part, of the upper jaw, which has appropriated the name of maxillaria to them. The figure of one of them, or of the two when joined, is fo irregular, that words can fcarce give an idea of it. The procejfes of each os maxillare may be reckoned feven. The firft is the long nafal one at Its upper and fore-part, which is broad below, and turns fmaller as it rifes upwards, to make the fide of the nofe. At the root of this a tranfverfe ridge may be obferved within the noftrils, which fupports the fore part of the upper edge of the os fpongiofum inferius. The fecond is produced backwards and outwards, from the root of the nafal procefs, to form the lower fide of the orbit; and therefore may be called orbitar. Tlie edge of this orbitar procefs, and the ridge of the nafal one, which is continued from it, make a confiderable portion of the external circum- ference of the orbit. From the proper orbitar procefs, a very rough triangular furface is extended downwards and out- wards, to be connedbed to the cheekbone; and therefore may be called the molar procefs, from the lowefl; protuberant part of which fome fhare of the mafleter mufcle tahes its rife. Behind the orbitar procefs, a large tuberofity or bulge of the bone

Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. 67 in the fuperciliary ridge, is the different length and ten- lion of the nerves and veffcls; the fliorter they are, the more they are funk into die bone as it grows.—Near the middle of the infide of each orbit, hard by or in the tranf- verfe future, there is a fmall hole for the paffage of the nafal twig of the firft branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and of a branch of the ophthalmic artery. This hole is fometimes entirely formed in the os ifrontis; in other Ikulls, the fides of it are compofed of this lafl bone and of the os planum. It is commonly known by the name of trbitarium internumy though anterius fliould be added, be- caufe of the next, which is commonly omitted.—This, which may be called orbiiarium internum pojierius^ is fuch another as the former j only fmaller, and about an inch deeper in the orbit; Through it a fmall branch of the ocu- lar artery paffes to the nofe.—Befides thefe fix, there are a great number of fmall hole's obfervable on the outer fur- face of this bone, particularly in tjie two protuberances ;^ove the eye-brows. Moft of them penetrate no further than the finufes, or than the diploe if the finufes are want., ing; though fometimes I have feen this bone fo perforated by a vaft number of thefe fmall holes, that, placed between the eye and a clear light, it appeared like a fieve. In the orbit of the generality of (keletons, we may obferve one, two, or more holes, which allow a paffage to a hog’s briftle through the Ikull. The place, fize, and number of thefe, are however uncertain; they generally ferve for the tranf- miflion of fmall arteries or nerves. The internal furface of the os fiontis is concave, except at the orbitar procelTes, which are convex, to fupport the anterior „lpl)es of the brain. This furface is not fo fmooth as the external; for the larger branches of the arteries of the dur^ mater'make fome furrows in its fidcs and baeje parts.

114 Part r. OF THE SKELETON. orbfit. They contain fixteen teeth, give rife to mufcles, tranfminion to nerves, &c. as mentioned in the defcription of their feveral parts. In each of the maxillary bones of a new-born child, the external orbitar procefs is hollow, with remarkable holes in it; there are five fockets for the teeth, of which the two pofterior are very large, and, when divided by a fecond crofs partition, make the number of fockets fix (e). The palate-plate is cribriform about the middle. The great tuberofity is not formed ;—inftead of the antrum, there k only an oblong deprefllon at the fide of the nollrils. OSSA PALATI. Ossa palati are commonly defcribed as two fmall fquarc bones, at the back-part of the palate or roof the mouth, though they are of much greater extent, being continued ' up the back-part of the noftrils to the orbit {/). Each palate- bone may therefore be divided into four parts, the palate fquare-bane, the pterygoid procefs, nafal lamella, and orbitar procefs. The fqunre-hone is unequally concave, for enlarging both the mouth and cavity of the nofe. The upper part of its internal edge rifes^in a fpine, after the fame manner as the palate-plate of the maxillary bone does, to be joined with the vomer. Its anterior edge is unequally ragged, for its firmer connection with the palate procefs of the os maxil- lare. The internal edge is thicker than the reft, and of an equal furface, for its conjunCUon with its fellow of the other fide. Behind, this bone is fomewhat in form of a crefeent, («) Albin.

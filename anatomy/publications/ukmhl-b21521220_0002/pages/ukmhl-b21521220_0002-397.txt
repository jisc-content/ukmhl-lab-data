Chap. XXX. ON THE THIGH. 355 Prevlous to the clefcriptlon of the mufcles that are fitua- ted on the thigh and leg, it is neceflary to take notice of a broad tendinous fafcia or flieath, which is fent oft from t!ie back and from the tendons of the glutei and adjacent mufcles. It is a ftrong thick membrane on the outfide of the thigh and leg; but, towards the infide of both, it gradually turns thinner, and has rather the appearance of cellular fubftance, than a tendinous membrane. A little below the trochanter major, it is firmly fixed to the linea afpera; and, farther down, to that part of the head of the tibia that is next the fibula *, where it fends off the tendinous ex- panfion along the outfide of the leg. It ferves to ftrengthen the a£Hon of the mufcles, by keeping them .firm in their proper places while in adlion, particularly the tendons that pafs over the joints, where this membrane is thickeft;; and it gives origin to a number of the fleftiy fibres of the mufcles. On the outfide is, - • I Tensor Vagina Femoris, ■ArifeSy by a narrow tendinous, and fleftiy beginning, from the external part of the anterior fuperior fpinous procefs of the os ilium.

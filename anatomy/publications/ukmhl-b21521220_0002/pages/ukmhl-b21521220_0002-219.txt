Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. ly the fpitic. This articulation is to be more fully defcribed after the oflii femoris are examined. The pelvis, then, has a large open above where it is con- tinued with the abdomen ; is Itrongly fenced by bones on the fides, back and fote-part j and appears with a wide opening belowi in the Ikeleton; but, in a recent fubjeft, a confiderable part of the opening is filled by the facrofciatic ligaments, pyriform, internal obturator, levatores ani, ge- mini, and coccygaei mufcles, which fupport and prote£l the contained parts better than bones could have done; fo that fpace is only left at the lowefl; part of it, for the large excretories, the vefica urinaria, intellinum rectum, and in females, the uterus, to difeharge themfelves. § 3. Bones of the Thorax. The Thorax, (i6), or chejl, which is the only part of the trunk of the body that we have not yet defcribed, reaches from below the neck to the belly ; and, by means of the bones that guard it, , is formed into a large cavity: The figure of it is fomewhat conoidal:. but its upper fmal- Icr end is not finilhed, being left open for the paflage of the wind-pipte, gullet, and large blood velTels ; and its low- er part or bafe, has no bones, and is fhorter before than behind ; fo that, to carry on our comparifon, it appears like an oblique lection of the conoid. Befides which, we ought alfo to remark, that the lower part of this cavity is narrower than feme way above (1); and that the middle of its back'part is confiderably diniinilhed by the bones Handing forwards into it. The bones which form the thorax are the twelve dorfal vertebrse behind, the ribs on the fides, and the llernum be- fore. VoL. I. Z The {h) Pe£tus caflum. (;) AJbin. deoflib. §169. 1

UTHORS are muck dividad in their opinions about the number of bones of which each fuperior extremi- ty (/) fhould be faid to confift ; fome defcribing the clavi- cle and fcapula as part of it, others clafling thefe two bones with thofe of the thorax: But fince mofl quadrupeds have no clavicles, and the human thorax can perform its func- tions right when the fcapula is taken away (I), while it is impolTible for us to have the right ufe of our arms without thefe bones, I mull think that they belong to the fuperior extremities. Each of the fuperior extremities may be divided into the Ihoulder, arm, fore-arm and hand.

Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. r'si too far backwards, by ftay-bands, or fome fuch means, till the mufcloe attain ftrength fuflicient to prevent that dange- rous motion. When we are acquainted with the ftru£Iure and articula.- tions of the firft and fecond vertebrte, and know exadtly the ftrength and connexion of their ligaments, there is no difficulty in underftanding the motions that arc performed upon, or by, the firft; though this fubjeO: was formerly matter of hot difpute among fome of the greateft anato- mifts (a). It is not my purpofe at prefent to entec into a detail of the reafons advanced by either party ; hut to ex- plain the fa£l, as any one may fee it, who w'lll remove the mufcles, which, in a recent fubjedf, hinder the view of thefe two joints, and then w'ill turn the head into all the ‘different pofitions of which it is capable. The head may then be feen to move forwards and backwards on the firft verte- » bra, as was already f.iid, while the atlas performs the clr- cumgyratio upon the fecond vertebra: the inferior obHque procelTes of the firft vertebra fluiffling eafily in a circular motion on the fuperior oblique procefles of the’fccond, and its body or anterior arch having a rotation on the tooth- like procefs, by which the perpendicular ligament that is fent from the point of the tooth-like procefs to the occipi- tal bone is twifted, while the lateral ligaments that fix the proceffus dentatus to the fides of the firft vert(;bra, and to the os occipitis, are very differently affo£led ; for the one upon the fide towards which the face is turned by the clr- cumgyraiio is much ftiortened and lax, while the oppofite one is ftretched and made tenfe, and, yielding at laft no more, prevents the head from turning any farther round on the axis. So that thefe lateral ligaments are the proper moderators of the circumgyratio of the head here ; which muft be larger or fmaller, as thefe ligaments are weaker or («) See £u(lach. 4c inotu capitis.

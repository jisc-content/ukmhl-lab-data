Os cuneifonne [d) is broader above, and towards the back of the hand, than it is below and forwards ; which gives it the refemblance of a wedge. The fuperlor flightly con- vex furface is included in the joint of the wrift, being op- pofed to tlie lower end of the ulna Below this the cunei- form bone has a rough fofla, wherein the ligament of the articulation of the wrift is fixed. On the internal fide of this bone, where it is contiguous to the os lunare, it is fmooth and flightly concave. Its lower furface, where it is contiguous to the os unciforme, is oblong, fomewhat fpi- ral, and concave. Near the middle of its anterior furface a circular plane appears, where the os pififorme is fuftain- ed. Os pl/lforms {e) is almoft fpherical, except one circular plane, or flightly hollow furface, which is covered with cartilage for its motion on the cuneiform bone, from which its whole rough body is prominent forw^ards into the palm ; having the rendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and a ligaâ€™ inent from the ftyloid procefs of the ulna, fixed to its up- per part; the tranfverfe ligament of the wrift is conneded to Its internal fide, ligaments extended to the unciform bone, and to the os metacarpi of the little finger, are at- tached to its lower part; the abdudor minimi digiti has Its origin from its fore-part; and, at the internal fide of it, a fmall depreflion is formed, for the palTage of the ulnar nerve.' Trapezium (/) has four unequal fides and angles in its back.part, from which it has got its name Above its furface is fmooth, flightly hollowed, and femicircular,' for its con)undion with the os fcaphoides.- Its external fide (JJ Triquetrum. {cj Cartilaginofum, fubrotundum, reftum, {/) Os cubiforme, trapezoides, muitangulum, majus.

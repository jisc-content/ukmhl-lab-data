310 OF THE MUSCLES Part II. Injerted^ by ftrong flelhy fibres, into the poftcrior part of the middle tendon. Ufe. The diaphragm is the principal agent in refpira- tion, particularly in infpiration : for when it is in action, the fibres, from their different attachments, endeavour to bring themfelves into a plane towards the middle tendon, by which the cavity of the thorax is enlarged, particularly at the fides, wliere the lungs are chiefly fituated and as the lungs muft always be contiguous to the infide of the thorax and upper fide of the diaphragm, the air ruflies in- to them, in ortler to fill up the increafed fpace. This rauf- cle is affilled by the two rows of intercoftals, which elevate the ribs, and the cavity of the thorax is more enlarged. In time of violent exercife, or whatever caufe drives the blood v^lth unufnal celerity towards the lungs, the pectoral muf- cles, the ferrati antici majores, the ferrati poftici fuperjo- res, and fcaleni mufcles, are brought into atflion. And in laborious infpiration, the mufcles which arife from the up- per part of the thorax, when the parts into which they are inferted, are fixed, lilcewife alfift. In exfpiration, the dia- phragm is relaxed and puflied up by the preffure of the abdominal mufcles upon the vifeera of the abdomen ; and at the fame time that they nrefs it upwards, they alfo, to- gether with the fterno-collales and ferrati pofiici inferiories, pull down the ribs, and are afftlted in a powerful manner by the elafticity of the cartilages that join the ribs to the fternum ; by which the cavity of the thorax is diminiflied, and the air fuddenly pulhed out of the lungs : and, in laborious exfpiration, the qaadrati lumborum, facro-lum- bales, and longiffimi' dorfi, concur in pulling down the ribs. The four pair are, f I. QjJ A-

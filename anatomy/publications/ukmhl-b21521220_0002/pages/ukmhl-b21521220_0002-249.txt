The olecranon makes it unneceflary that the tendojis of tlie ex- tenfor mufcles fliould pafs over the end of the os humeri j which would have been of ill confequence in the great flex- ions of this joint, or when any confiderable force is appli- ed to this part (5'). The anterior procefs is not fo large, nor does it reach fo high, as the one behind; but is fliarp- er at its end, and therefore is named coronaid. Between thefe two proceffes, a large femicircular or figmoid conca- vity is left; the furface of which on each fide of a middle rifing, is llanting, and cxaflly adapted to the pulley of the bone of the arm Acrofs the middle of it, there is a fmall finuofity for lodging mucilaginous glands ; where, as well as in a fmall hollow on the Internal fide of it, the car- tilage that lines the reft of its furface is wanting. Round the brims of this concavity the bone is rough, where the capfular ligament of the joint is implanted. Immediate- ly below the olecranon, on the back-part of the ulna, a flat triangular fpongy furface appears, on which we com- monly lean At the internal fide of this, there is a lar- ger hollow furface, where the mufculus ancomeus is lod- ged ; and the ridge at the infide of'this gfves rife to the mufculus fupinator radii brevis.——Between the top of the ridge and the coronoid procefs is the femilunated fmooth cavity, lined with cartilage; in which, and in a ligament ex- tended from the one to the other end of this cavity, the roundhead of the radius plays. Immediately below it, a rough hollow gives lodging to mucilaginous glands. Be- low the root of the coronoid procefs, this bone is fcabrous and unequal, where the brachiaeiis internus is inferted On the outfide of that, we obferve a fmooth concavity, where (?)

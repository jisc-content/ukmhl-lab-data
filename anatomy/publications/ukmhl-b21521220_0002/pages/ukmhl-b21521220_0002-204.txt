Sometimes a notch is only formed at the lower part in each fide of this bone ; and in other fub- jeds there is a hole common to it and the os coccygis, through which the twenty-ninth pair of fpinal nerves pafTes ; and frequently a bony bridge is formed on the back part of each fide by q procefs fent up from the back*part of the os coccygis, and joined to the little knobs which the lad bone of the os facrum has indead of a fpinal procefs. Un- der this bridge or jugum, the twenty-ninth pair of fpinal nerves runs in its courfe to the common holes jud now de- feribed. The upper part of the body of the fird bone refembles the vertebrae of the loins ; but the fmall fifth bone is ob- long tranfverfely, and hollow in the middle of its lower fur- face. The fubdance of the os facrum is very fpongy, without any confuler-ible folid external plates, and is lighter pro- portionally to its bulk tlian any other bone in the body ; but it is fecured from injuries by the thick mufcles that co- ver it behind, and by the drong ligamentous membranes that clofely adhere to it.— .^s this is one of the mod remark- able Indanccs of this fort of defence aflbrded a foft weak bone, we may make the general obfervation : That w’herever we meet with fuch a bone, one or other, or both thefe defences, ■are udd ; the fird to ward od injuries and the fccond to keep tiie fubdance of the bone from yielding too eafily.

378 SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. Part ir. impreflions made by the veflels and cellular fubllance and perhaps by the nerv^es: but Dr Monro, in the work above quoted, has defcribed and delineated a fimilar appearance in the tendons and nerves ; and is of opinion, that they are to be confidered as folds or joints, ferving to accom- modate the parts to the different Hates of flexion and ex* tenfion. In proof of this, he finds, that thofe parts wdiich appear thus in their relaxed ftate, lofe it when they are much flretched. With regard to the nature of the ultimate moving fibres, there have been many difputes. Some anatomiils think them folid ; others, hollow, formed of a ferics of veffels or rhomboidal chains communicating with each other: Some, again, have been of opinion, that they are full of a kind of down or wooHy fubftance, &c. It may be afked. Whether they are hollow ? whether they are continued from the arteries ? or whether the dif- ference between mufcular and tendinous fibres, lies in the latter being rendered more denfe, and beat cloffer together by an expulfion of the fluids ? That thefe are not probable, appears from the minutenefs of the fibres, which are found lefs than the red-blood globules, and from the whitenefs of a mufcle after the blood is waflied out of it; to which add the phyfiological reafons, after mentioned, (p. 385.) And, in general, more ftrength may be expedled from a folid fibre. The flrufture of the tendons and aponeurofes agrees in fome refpefls with, but differs in others from, that of the mufcles. We obferve their fibres regularly difpcfed, and feparated by cellular fubHance and blood-velTels *, and with- out doubt they have lymphatics and nerves: but the ten- dinous fibres are clofler together than thofe of the mufcles, the cellular fubftance which feparates them is finer, their red veffels are fewer in number, and the nerves cannot be traced, without difficulty, into their fubftance.

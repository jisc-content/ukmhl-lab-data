Chap. I. IN GENERAL. 47 &c.——To thefe cartilages we chiefly owe the fecurity of the moveable articulations; for, without them, the bo- ny fibres would fprout out, and intimately coalefce with the adjoining bone ; whence a true anchylofis mult nccefTa- rily follow; which always happens when the cartilages are eroded by acrid matter, or oflified from want of motion or defeft of (liquor, as is frequently the cafe after wounds of the joints, pviidarthrocace, fcrophula, and fpina ventofa, or from old age, and long Immobility of joints '.q\. Her.ce we may know what the annihilation is, which is faid tp be made of the head of a bone, and of the cavity for lodging it, after an unreduced frafturc I'r). The move- able cartilages interpofed in joints ferve to make the mo- tions both freer and-more fafe than they would othervvife be. Thofe placed on the ends of bones that are not ar- ticulated, as on the fpine of the os ilium, bafe of the fca- pula, &c. ferve to prevent the bony, fibres from growing out too far. Cartilages fometimes ferve as ligaments, ei- ther to faften together bones that are immoveably joined, fuch are the cartilages between the os facrum and ofla i- lium, the ofla pubis, &c. or to conne(ff bones that enjoy manifeft motion, as thofe do which are placed between the bodies of the true vertebrze, &c. --Cartilages very often ^ do the office of bones to greater advantage than thefe laft could; as in the cartilages of the ribs, thofe which fupply . brims to cavities, &c. v t; Too great thicknefs or thinnefs, length or ffiortnef?, hardnefs or fupplenefs, of cartilages/'may ‘therefore caufe great difordcrs in the body. t ' OF (7) Cplumb. dc re anat.

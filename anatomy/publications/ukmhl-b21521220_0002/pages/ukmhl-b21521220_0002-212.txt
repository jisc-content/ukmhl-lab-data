170 ' OF T n't: SKELETON. Part L fiicrum, to fecure more firmly the conjundllon of thefe bones. The paffages of the medullary veflels are very confpicuous, both in the dorfum and cofta of many ofla ilium j but in others they are inconfiderable. The pofterior and lower parts of thefe bones are thick ; but they are generally exceedingly thin and compa£t at their mid- dle, where they are expofed to the a£lions of the mufculi glutsei and iliacus internus, and to the preflure of the bowels contained in the belly—The fubftance of the ofla ilium is moftly cellular, except a thin external table. In a ripe child, the fpine of the 'os ilium is cartilagi- nous ; and is afterwards joined to the bone, ,in form of an epiphyfe.— The large lower end of this bone is not com- pletely offifitd. Os Ischium (y), or hip-bone, is of a middle bulk between the two other parts of the os innominatum, is fituated lo'weft of the»|hree, and is of a very irregular figure. Its extent might be marked by a horizontal line drawn near through the middle of the acetabulum ; for the upper bulbous part of this bone forms rather lefs than the lower half of that great cavity, and the fmall leg of it rifes to much the fame height on the other fide of the great hole common to this bone and the os pubis. From the upper thick part of the os ifchium, a (harp pro- ccfs, called by fome authors fpinous, ftands out backwards, from which chiefly the-mufculus coccygseus and fuperior gemellus, and part of the levator ani, rife ; and the ante- rior or internal facrofciatic ligament is fixed to it. Between the upper part of this ligament and the bones, it was for- merly obferved that the pyriform mufcle, the pofterior crural veflels, and the fciatic nerve, pafs out of the pelvis. — Im- ^yj Coxa?, coxcndicls, pyxU,

Chnp.ir. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 203 from behind forwards and downwards. The body of the os humeri is flatted behind by the extenfors of the fore-arm. Near the lower end of this bone, a large fliarp ridge is extended on its outfide, from which the niufculus fpinator radii longus, and the longed head of the extcnfor carpi radialis, rife. Oppofite to this, there is another fmall ridge to which the aponeurotic tendon, that gives origin to the fibres of the internal and external brachial muffles, is fixed ; and from a little deprclfion on the fore-fide of it, the pronator radii teres rifes. ' The body of the os humeri becomes gradually broader towards the lower end, where it has feveral procefles; at the roots of which there is a cavity before and another be- hind {k). The anterior is divided by a ridge into two ; the external, which is the lead, receives the end of the radius; and the internal receives the .coronoid procefs of the ulna in the flexions of the fore arm, while the pode<i rior deep triangular cavity lodges the olecranon in the extenfions of that limb. The bone between thefe twp cavities is prelTed fo thin by the procefles of the ulna, to appear diaphanous in feveral fubjedls. The fides of the poderior cavity are dretched out into two procefles, one on each fide : Thefe are called condyles; from each of ■Vvhich a drong ligament goes out to the bones of the fore- arm. The external condyle, which has an oblique direc- tion alfo forwards in refpe£l: of the internal, when the arm is in the mod natural podure (/), is equally broad,* and has an obtufe fmooth head rifing from it forwards. From the rough part of the condyle, the inferior heads of the bicor- nis, the extenfor digitorum communis, extenfor carpi ul- narls, anconieus, and fome part of the fpinator radii bre- vis, take their rife ; and on the fmooth head the upper end of the radius plays.

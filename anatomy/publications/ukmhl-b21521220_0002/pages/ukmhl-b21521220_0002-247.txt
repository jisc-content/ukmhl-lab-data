It is true, that there is not near fo flrong a defence at the lower part of the articulation ^ but, in the ordinary podures of the arm, that is, fo long as it is at an acpte angle with the trunk of the body, there cannot be any force applied at this place to occafioii a luxation, fince the joint is protefted fo well above. The motions which the arm enjoys by this articulation are to every fide ; and by the fucceflion of thefe different motions, a circle may be defcribed. Befides which, the bone performs a fmall rotation round its own axis. But though this can be performed with the round head in all pofitions •, yet as thefe vary, the effefts upon the body of the bone are very different: For if the middle of the head is the centre of rotation, as it Is 'when the arm hangs dowri by the fide, the body of the bone is only moved forwards and backwards; becaufe the axis of motion of the head is nearly at right angles with the length of the bone (m); whereas, when the arm is raifed to right angles with the trunk of the body, the centre of motion, and the axis of the bone, come to be of the fame flraight line ; and there- fore the body of the os humeri performs the fame motion with its head. Though the m.otions of the arm feem to be cxtenfive, yet the larger fhare of them depends on the motions of the fcapula. The lower end of the os humeri is articulated with the bone of the fore-arm, and carries them with it In all its motions, but ferves as a bafe on which they perform the motions peculiar to themfelves ; as fhall be defcribed afterwards. Both the ends of this bone are cartilaginous in a new- born infant; and the large head with the two tubercles, and (w) Hlppocrat. de «rticul. § i,

Chap.II. INFERIOR EXTREMITIES. 247 external end but is pointed below. The fmooth furface is fitted to the os cubpides. Though the furfaces by which the aftragalus and os cal- cis are articulated, feem fit enough for motion 5 yet the very ftrong ligaments by which thefe bones are connected, prevent much motion, and render this principal part of our . bafe, which refts on the ground, firm. A large fliare of the heel-bone is ofTified at the ordinary time of birth, and the large knob appears afterwards in form of an epiphyfe. Os naviculare (y), is fomewhat circular It Is form- ed into an oblong concavity behind, for receiving the ante,i' rior head of the aftragalus. On the upper furface there is a rough fofla. Below, the os naviculare is very un- equal and rough ; but hollow for the fafety of the mufcles. — On its infide a large knob rifes out, from which the abdudlor pollicis takes in part its origin, the tendon of the tibialis pofticus is inferted into it, and to it two remarkable ligaments are fixed *, the firft is the ftrong one, formerly mentioned which fupports the aftragalus ; the fecond is ftretched from this bone obliquely crofs the foot, to the metatarfal bones of the middle toe, and of the toe next to the little one.—On the outfide of the os naviculare there is a femicircular ‘fmooth furface, where it is joined to tlie os cuboides. The fore-part of this bone is all covered with cartilage, and is divided into three fmooth planes, fitted to the three ofla cuneiformia. ^ The os naviculare and aftragalus are joined as a ball and focket; and-the naviculare moves in all dire£Hons in turn- ing the toes inwards, or in laifing or deprefiing either fide of the foot, though the motions are greatly .reftrained by the ligaments which connc£l this to the other bones of the tarfus.

This hole is often double, and that when tire nerve has happen- ed to fplit before it has efcaped from the bone. The fe- cond is the foramen incifivum, jult behind the fore teeth; whii h, at its under part, is one irregular hole common to both the maxillary bones when they are joined ; but, as it afeends, foon divides Into two, three, or fometimes more holes; feme of which open into each noftril. Through them fmall arteries and veins, and a twig of the fccond branch of the fifth pair of nerves, pafs, and make a communication between, or join the lining coats of the nofe and moufh. In fome fubjecls, Steno’s du£l may be traced fome length on the fide of thefe paffages next to the nofe, and fmall orifices may be obferved opening into the mouth. The firft common hole is that which appears'at the inner fide of the back part of the tuberolity and of the fockets of the teeth; and is formed by a fofla in this bone, and a cor- refpopding one in the os palati: through it a nerve, which Is a branch of the fecond branch of the fifth pair, runs to the palate. The other common hole is the great flit in the out- fide of the orbit, deferibed already as the fecond commoa hole of the fphenoid bone. On the nafal procefs holes may be often obferved for the pafTage of vefiels to the fubftance of the bones; and, at the back part of each tuberofity, fevcral foramina are placed, for the tranfmiflion of nerves to the cavity within : but thefe are uncertain. All the body of the maxillary bone Is hollow, and leaves a large ftms like the frontal and fphenoid, which is com- monly, but unjuftly, called antrum Highmorianum (n). ^ When the os maxillare Is fingle, or feparated from all the Other bones of a fkelcton, its antrum appears to have a large («) Gens,

OF THE SKELETON. Part 1. 84 the natural contraaion of the proper flexors, elfe the head would always fall forwards, as it does when a man is a- fleep, or labours under a pally, as well as in infants, where the weight of the head far exceeds the proportional flrengih of thefe mufcles. This feeming difadVantageous fituatiou of the condyles is, however, of lingular ufe, by allowing fufficient fpace for the cavities of the mouth and fauces, and for lodging a fuEcient number of mufcles, which commonly ferve for other ufss; but may at pleafure be dire£led to adt on the head, and then they have an advan- tageous lever to adl with, fo as to be able to fullain a con- fiderable weight, or other force applied, to pull the head back. Somewhat more externally than the condyles, tliere is a fmall rifing and femilunated hollow in each fide, which make part of the holes common to the occipital and pe- trous bones.—Immediately behind this, on each fide, a fcabrous ridge is extended from the middle of the condyle towards the root of the maflold procefs. Into this ridge the mufculus lateralis, commonly afcribed to Fallopius, is inferted.—About the middle of the external convex fur- face, a large arch runs crofs the bone ; froiTi the upper laeral parts of which the occipital mpfcles have their rife ; to its middle the trapezii are attached; and half-way be- tween this and the great hole, a leffer arch is extended. In the })ollows between the middle of thefe arches the com- plex! are inferred; and in the depreEons more external and further forward than thefe, the fplenii are infericdi Eetween the middle of the kiTer arch and the great hole* the little hollpw rriarks of the redfi minores appear-, and on each fi^e of thefe the lldhy infertions of the obliqui fu- p^riores and reifU niajores make deprellious.——Through the middle of i;]ie .tw'0 arches a fmall Earp fpine is placed, ■vj^ch ferves kind of partition between tl\e mufcles

Few keep to fuch a general definition of the fynchondrofis as I have done; and whether they deter- mine it to allow no motion, or an obfcure or a manifeft one, they bring themfelves into difficulties, becaufe there are examples of all thefe three kinds. Some again, by too nicely diflinguiffiing obfcure and manifeft motions of bones, have blended the fynarthrojis and diarthrofis; and from thence have branched out the different compound fpecies of articulations that may be formed of them, fo far, that they could find no examples in the body to illuf- trate them by.—It would be tedious to enumerate more of the jarring opinions, and it would be far more fo to give a detail of the arguments ufed by the difputants. It is fufficient for my purpofe that it is underftood in what fenfe I take thefe technical terms; whicfi I do in the fol- lowing manner. When I mention the fymphyfis or fynarthrofis, or any fpecies of them, I fliall always underftand them according to the explication already given of them. But though the preceding account of the diarthrofis, or articulation of moveable bones, has been almoft unlverfally received ; yet as it does not comprehend all the moveable articula- tions of the body, and one of its fpecies does not anfwer to any notion we can have of the cohjunftion of two bones, I muft beg leave to change the definitions and kinds of thefe joints. I would call diarthrofis^ That conjun£Hon of bones where- by they are fitted for motion, being each covered with a fmooth cartilage, connected by one or more common li- gaments, and lubricated with liquor at the conjoined parts: In which definition I have no regard to the quantity of motion which they really do perform j the motion being * often /

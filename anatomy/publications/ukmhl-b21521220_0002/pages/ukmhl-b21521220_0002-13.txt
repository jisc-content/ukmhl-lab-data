DEDICATION. Vll the multifarious and accumulated duties of his office, to attend to the faithfulnefs of the tranflations; and the Book came before the Public therefore in a very imperfed: flate. These defecls I have endeavoured to remedy in this Edition ; and I am not confcious, that any errors have efcaped my notice. Should any, however, be difcovered, 1 triift that your candour w'ill attribute them to their true caufe, viz. the hurry of correding three large oclavo volumes for three prefles, and pre- paring tranflations for two of them in the fpace of a few weeks. The thanks of the Public are juftly due to you for patronifing, and to the Editor for projeding fo ufeful a work. The faults of the former Editions were un- avoidable, from the circumftances above mentioned ; and if, by amending them, I have any way contri- buted to render the w'ork more worthy of your patro- nage, or more ufeful to the attendants at your crowd- ed theatre, I fhall think myfelf highly honoured. I have the Honour to be, With the greateft Refped, S I R, Your moft obedient humble Servant, JOHN ROTHERAM. \

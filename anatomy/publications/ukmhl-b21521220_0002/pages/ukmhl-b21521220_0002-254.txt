This bone is alfo joined to the ulna by a double articulation : for above, a tubercle of the radius plays in a focket of the ulna ; whilft below, the radius gives the focket, and the ulna the tubercle. But then the motion performed in thefe two is very different: for, at the upper end, the radius does no more than turn round its axis ; while, at the lower end, it moves in a fort of cycloid upon the round part of the ul- na ; and as the hand is articulated and firmly conneAed here with the radius, they mull move together When the palm is turned uppermofl, the radius is faid to perform the fupinaiion : when the back of the hand is above, it is faid to be prone. But then the quicknefs and large extent of thefe two motions are affifted by the ulna, which, as was before obferved, can move with a kind of fmall rota- tion on the fioping fides of the pulley. This lateral mo- tion, though very inconfiderable in the joint itfelf, is con- fpjcuous at the lower end of fuch a long bone ; and the ftrong ligament conne£ling this lower end to the carpus, makes the hand more readily obey thefe motions. When we defign a large circular turn of our hand, we increafe it by the rotation of the os humeri, and fometimes employ the fpine and inferior extremities to make thefe motions of pro- nation or fupination of the hand large enough. \ § 4. ^he Hand. The hand (y) comprehends all from the joint of the vvrill to the points of the fingers. Its back-part is convex, for greater firmnefs and ftrength ; and it is concave before, for containing more furely and conveniently fuch bodies as we take hold of.

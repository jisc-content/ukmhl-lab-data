OF THE SKELETON. 158 Part L proceffes at a greater diftance from each other, and facing more backwards and forwards. Both tranfverfe and fpinal procefles of the middlemof!; vertebrse of the loins are longeft and thickefl ; in the ver- tebrae above and below, they are lefs : So that thefe procefles of the firll (/) and fifth (^) are the leaft, to prevent their firiking on the ribs or oflh ilium, or their bruifing the muf- cles in the motions of the fpine. The epiphyfes round the edges of the bodies of the lum- bar vertebrce are moll raifed in the two loweft ; which con- fequently make them appear hollower in the middle than the others are. The body of the fifth vertebra is rather thinner than that of the fourth. The fpinal procefs of this fifth is fmall- er, and the oblique procefles face more backwards and for- wards than in any other lumbar vertebra. • After confidering the finuflure of the particular ver- tebras, and their mutual connetHoft, we may obferve a fe- licitous care taken that they fhall not be disjoined without great difficulty. For, befides being connedled by ftrong li- gaments proportioned to the forces which are to be refill- ed, their bodies either enter fo into each other as to pre- vent their being difplaced any way, as in the vertebrae of the neck; or they are propped on all fides, as thofe of the back are by the ribs; or their furfaces of contatl are fo broad, as to render the feparation almofl impradicable, as in the loins : while the depth and articulation of the ob- lique procefles are exadlly proportioned to the quantity of motion which the other parts of the bones allow, or the mufcles can perform. Yet as thefe oblique procefles are fir.all, and therefore not capable of fo fecure a conjun£lion as the larger bodies, they may fooner yield to a disjoining force j (<{) Acr;^t»,irr{j Fnlciens.

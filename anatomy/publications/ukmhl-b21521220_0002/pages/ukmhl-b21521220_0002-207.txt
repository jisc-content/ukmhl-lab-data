Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. 165 cartilage is interpofed; therefore their articulation is ana- logous to that of the bodies of the vertebrje of the neck; For, as has been above remarked, the lower end of the os facrum, and of each of the three fuperior bones of the os coccygis, has a fmall depreflion in the middle ; and the upper part of a}l the bones of the os cdccygis is a little con- cave, and confequently the interpofed cartilages are thickeft in the middle, to fill up both cavities ; by which they con- neft the bones more firmly.—When the cartilages offify, the upper end of each bone is formed into a cavity, exadliy adap- ted to the protuberant lower end of the bone immediately a- bove.—From this fort of articulation, it is evident, that, un- lefs when thefe bones grow together^ all of them are capable of motion; of which the firft and fecond, efpeclally this laft, enjoys the largeft fliare. The lower end of the fourth bone terminates in a rougli point, to which a cartilage is appended. To the fides of thefe bones of the os coccygis, the coccygsci % ' mufcles (0), and part of the levatores ani, and of the glutaei maxim'i, are fixed. The fubllance of thefe bones is very fpongy, and in chil- dren cartilaginous •, there being only a part of the firft bone oflified in a new born infant, Since therefore the intcfti- num re£l;um of children is not fo firmly fuppoVted as it is in adults, this may be one reafon why they are more fubje(ff to a procidentia ani than old people {'p). Frorn the defcription of this bone, we fee how little it refembles the vertebrae ; fmce it feldom has procefl'es, ne- ver has any cavity for, the fpinal marrOw, nor holes for the pafPage of nerves. Its connexion hinders it from being moved to either fide ; and its motion backwards and for- \ wards (0) Douglas, Myograph, chap. 40. Euftach. tab. 36. No 45. 20. (/>) Spigcl. dc humani corp-fabyic.

87 Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. ■s. externally; through thefe the ninth pair of nerves go out of the Ikull The fourth and fifth holes pierce from be- hind the condyle of each fide into the foflae of the lateral finufes; they ferve for the paflage of the cervical veins to thefe finufes. Often one of thefe holes is wanting, fome- times both, \vhen the veins pafs through the great fora- iiien. Befides thefe five, we frequently meet with other holes near the edges of this bone, for the tranfmiffion of veins; but their number and diameter are very uncertain. The two common foramina are the large irregular holes, one in each fide, between the fides of the cuneiform pro- cefs and the edges of the petrous bones. In a recent fub- je£l, a ftrong membrane runs crofs from one fide to the other of each of thefe holes: in fome heads I have feen this membrane oQlfied, or a bony partition dividing each liole: and in the greater number of adult Ikulls, a fmall fharp.pointed procefs ftands out from *the os petrofum, and there is a more obtufe rlfing in the occipital bone, be- tween which the partition is ftretched. Behind this parti- tion, where the largeft fpace is left, the lateral finus has its palTage ; and before it the eighth pair of nerves and acceflbrius make their exit out of the Ikull; and fome au- thors fay, an artery pafles through tliis hole to be bellow- ed on the dura mater. The occipital bone is among the thickeft of the cranium, though unequally fo; for it .is llronger above, where it has uo other defence than the common teguments, than it is below; for being there prefled by the lobes of the brain and cerebellum on one fide, and by the a6lion of the mufcles on the other, it is fo very thin as to be diaphanous in mtt- ny fkulls: but then thefe mufcles: ward off injuries; and the ridges and fpines, which are frequent here, make it fufliclently ftrong to refill ordinary forces. ^ ■. .

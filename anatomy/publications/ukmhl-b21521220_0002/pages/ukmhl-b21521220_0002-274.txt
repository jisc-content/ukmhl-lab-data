23^ OF THE SKELETON. Parti. the thigh bone, and its upper end being covered with very thick mufcles, make greater difhcully in diftinguifiiing be- tween a luxation and fradure here, than in any other part of the body. § 2. T/:e Leg. The leg (d) is compofed, according to the common ac- count, of two bones, tibia and jihula^ though it feems to have a very good title to a third, the rotula; which bears a flrong analogy to the olecranon of the ulna, and moves, always with the other two, TIBIA. Tibia {e\ fo called from its refemblance to an old mufi- cal pipe or flute,' is the long thick triangular bone, fituated at the internal part of the leg, and continued*in alinoft a, ' ftraight Hne from the thigh bone. The upper end of the tibia is large, bulbous, and fpon- gy, and is divided into two cavities by a rough irregular protuberance (f), v.^hich is hollow at its mofl prominent part, as w'ell as before and behind. The anterior of the two ligaments that compofe the great crofs one is inferted into the middle cavity, and the dtpreflion behind receives the poflerlor ligament.- The two broad cavities at the fides of this protuberance are npt equal: for the internal is oblong and deep, to receive the internal condyle of the thigh-bone 5 while the external is more fuperficial and rounder, for the external condyle.- In each of thefc two cavities of a recent fubjeft, a femilunar cartilage is placed, {jf) Crus, tibia.

Part II. 37<5 SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. neurojii. The cellular texture which covers the whole .ten- don, is called its vagina or peath^ and refembles the coat of a mufcle. That flefhy fibres truly change into fuch as aire tendinous, fays Dr Haller, is evident from comparing a foetus, _iil which there are few tendons, with a child of fome years growth, in which there are many more ; and both with an adult, in which there are the greateft number. But Dr Wrilberg obferves, in oppofition to this, that many ten- dons are found in a foetus, ,which could not aflume this na- ture by mufcular a£tion ; as the tendo Achillis, aponeuro- fis plantaris, centrum diaphragmatis, &c. Befides, in va- rious parts pf the body there are tendons found without correfponding mufcles. ' Mufcles which are not inferted into any of the bones, have commonly no tendons, as the fphin£lers and mufcu- lar membranes of the vifeeta and veflels. But thofe com- monly end in long tendons, which arc required to pafs round the joints and heads of the bones, to be inferted in thofe extremities which are more moveable. In a foetus the mufcles are evidently inferted into the periofteum only; but in adults, where the periofteum is more clofely joined W'ith the bone itfelf, the tendons, being confufed with the periofteum, pafs together with that even into the foveolx of the bone. The tendinous .fibres, indeed, often lie in a ftraight Une ■with the flefhy ones, and are as it were a continuation of them. But in many parts of the body the flefhy fibres are obliquely inclined to* the tendon, and adhere to it *, and the tendon itfelf grows thicker in its progrefs by continual- ly receiving new fibres. This is.called a tendinous mufcle* Other tendons He in the middle between two plates of fibres, which are inferted on each fide of the tendon at angles obtufe downward i and tliis is caile<l a pennated mufcle*

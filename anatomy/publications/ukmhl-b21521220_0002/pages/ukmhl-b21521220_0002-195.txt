Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. ^53 filled by all the vertebrce of the neck and loins; and i£ this is not fufficient, we employ mod of the joints of the lower extremities. This combination of a great many joints towards the performance of one’ motion, is alfo to be obferved in feveral other parts of the body; notwith- ftanding fuch motion being generally fald to be performed by fome fingle joint alone. The third vertebra of the neck is by fome csWed axis j but this name is applied to it with much lefs reafon than to the fecond. This third, and the three below, have no- thing particular in their ftru£lure, but all their parts come under the general defeription formerly given, each of them being larger as they defeend. The feventh (b) vertebra of the neck is near to the form of thofe of the back, having the upper and lower f^rfaces of its body lefs hollow than the others: The oblique pro- cefses are more perpendicular; neither fpinal nor tranf- verfe procefses are forked. This feventh and the fixth ver- tebra of the neck have the hole in each of their tranfverfe procefses more frequently divided by a fmall crofs bridge, that goes between the cervical vein and artery, than any of the other vertebrae. Tlie twelve Dorsal (r) niay be dlftlnguified from the o- ther vertebrae of the fpine by the following marks. Their bodies are of a middle f ze, between thofe of the neck and loins :—they are more convex before than either of the other two forts ; and are flatted laterally by the preffure of the ribs, which are inferted into fmall cavities formed in their Tides, This flatnefs of their Tides, which makes the figure of thefe vertebrae almofl an half oval, is of good ufe ; as it aflbrds a firm aftict|lation to the ribs, allows the trachea arterla to divide at a fmall angle, and : VoL.

BONES OF THE HEAD. 6i Chap. II. fo'thin, that their edges oppofed to each other are not fuf- ficiently thick to flop the extenfion of their fibres in length, and thus to caufe the common ferrated appearance of fu- tures explained in p. 36. ; but the narrow edge of the one bone Aides over the other. The fquamous form is alfo more convenient here ; becaufe fuch thin edges of bones, when accurately applied one to another, have fcarce any rough furface, to obftru£l or hurt the mufclfe in its con- traction; which is ftill further provided for, by the man- ner of laying thefe edges on each other; for, in viewing their outfide, we fee the temporal bone^ covering the fplle- noida! and parietal, and this lall fupporting the fphenoidal, while both mount on the frontal ; From which difpofition. it is evident, that, while the temporal mufcle is contract- ing, which is the only time it prefles ftrongly in its motion on the bones, its. fibres Aide eafily over the external edges. Another advantage of this AruCtufe is, that the whole part is made ftronger by the bones thus fupporting each other. ‘‘The bones of the Acull are joined to thofe of the face, by fcliindylefiS and futures.—The fchindylefis is in the partir tion of the nofe.The futures faid to be common to the cfanlum and face are fi\’'e; viz. the ethmoidal, fphenoidal, tranfverfe, and two' zygomatic.—^—Parts, however, of thefe futures are only at the junCtion of thC bones of the fkull. ethmoidal and fpkenoidal futiires furround the bones of thefe names; and in fome places help to make up other futures, particularly the yy/rfirmoz/x afid tratifverfc ; and in dther parts there is but one future common to thefe two bones. The iranfvsrfe future is extended quite crofs the face, from the external canthus of one orbit to the fame place of the other, by fmking from the cantlius down the outfide of ?

*9 Chap. I. IN GENERAL. The offificatlon of bones depentls prlncipnlly on their reflels being fo difpofed, and of fuch diameters, as to fe- parate a liquor, which may eafily turn into a bony fub- Itance, when it is deprived of its thinner parts ; as feems plain from the obfervarion of the callous matter feparated after fradlures and ulcers, where part of the bone is taken out; For, in thefe cafes, the vefi'els externling themfelves, and the liquors added to them, are gradually formed into granulated fleih; which fills up all the fpace where the bone is taken from, then hardens till it becomes as firm as any other part of the bone. '^Tliis happens frequently, ' even when the ends of the difeafod bone are at a cpnfiderable di- ftance from each other [v). > The induration of bones is alfo greatly affifted by their being expofed, more than any other parts, to the ftrong prelTure of the great weights they fupport, to the violent fontradlion of the mufcles fixed to theiriu and to the force of the parts they contain, which endeavour to make viay for their own further growth. By all this preffing force, the folid fibres and veflels'of bones are thruft clofcr, and fuch particles' of the fluids conveyed in thefe veflels as are fit to be united to the fibres are fooner and more firmly incorporated with them, while the remaining fluids are for- cibly driven out by the veins, to be mixed with the mafs of blood. In confcquence of this, the veffels gradually diminifh as the bones harden. From which again we can underftand one reafon ■why the bones of young animals- fooner re-unite after a frafture than thofe of old, and why cattle that are put too foon to hard labour feldom are of fuch large fize as others of the fame brood who are longer kept from labour.

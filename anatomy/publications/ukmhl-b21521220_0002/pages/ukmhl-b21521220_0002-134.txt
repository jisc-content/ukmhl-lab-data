OF THE SKELETON. Part I 92 I Is received into the furrow of the vomer.—Its pofterior edge is joined to the fore-part of the proceflus azygos of the fphenoid bone. Its upper edge joins the nafal procefs of the frontal and nafal bones ; and its anterior one is epn- nefled to the middle cartilage of the nofe. From all which, the ufes of this bone are evident, viz. to fuftain the anterior lobes of the brain; to give paflage to the olfaftory nerves, and attachment to the falx ; to enlarge the organ of fmelling, by allowing the membrane of the nofe a great extent; to ftraighten the paflage of the nir through the nofe, by leaving only a narrow winding canal, on the fenfible membranous fides of which the fub- flances conveyed along with the air mull ftrike; to form part of the orbit of the eyes and feptum narium; while all its parts are fo light as. not to be in hazard of feparating by their weight; and they are fo thin as to form a large fur- face, without occupying much fpace. This brittle fub- flance, however, -is fufficiently protected from external in- , juries by the firm bones which cover it. If this bone is feized on by any corroding matter, we may eafily conceive what defl;ru£lion may enfue. Hence it is, that an oztena is difficult to cure; and that in vio- lent feurvies, or in the lues venerea, the fabric of the nofe, the eyes, and life itfelf are in danger. The fituation of the nafal plate may fhow us how dangerous a fradlure of • the bones of the nofe may be, when made by a force ap- plied to their middle fore-part, of a perfon in whom this nafal plate is perpendicular. The ethmoid bone of ripe children is divided into two by a perpendicular cartilage, which, when offified, is the crifha galli and nafal plate; but its other parts are offified and complete. OS

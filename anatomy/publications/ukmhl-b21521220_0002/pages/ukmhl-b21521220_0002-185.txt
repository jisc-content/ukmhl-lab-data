Chap.II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. M3 to the different diftenfion or repletion of the vefsels com- pofing it, we may underftand how we become taller after a plentiful meal, and decreafe after fading or evacuations (/)• 6. From the different articulations of the bodies and ob- blique procefses of the vertebrx, and the different ftrength of the ligaments, it is plain, that they are formed fo as to allow much larger motiou forwards than backwards j this laft being of much lefs ufe, and might be dangerous, by over-ftretching the large blffcd-vefsels that are contiguous to the bodies of the vertebr3e («)• 7* The intervertebral cartilages fhrivelling as they become more folid by age, is the caufe why old people generally bow forwards, and can- not raife their bodies to fuch an erect poflure as they had in their youth. The ufes of the true vertebrae are, to give us an eredt pof- ture ; to allow fufficient and fecure motion to the head, neck, and trunk of the body; and to fupport and defend the bowels and other foft parts. ' At the ordinary time of birth, each vertebra confifls of three bony pieces, conne£ted by cartilages; to wit, the bo- dy, which is not fully offified; and a long crooked bone on ■ each fide, on which we fee a fmall fhare of the bony bridge, the oblique procefses complete, the beginning tranfverfe procefses, and the oblique plate, but' no fpinal procefses: fo that the teguments are in no danger of being hurt by the (harp ends of fhefe fpinal procefses, while a child is in its bended poflure in the womb, nor while it is fqueezed in the birth. From this general mechanifm of the fpine, an account is eafily deduced of all the different preternatural curvatures of which the fpine is capable : For if one or more vertebrae, or their cartilages, are of unequal thicknefs in oppofitc fidcs, ftj Abbe Fontenu.

OF THE BONES 4 / THE DIFFERENT CLASSES, &c. OF BONES. The broad bones have thin fides, by the plates being foon and equally fent off to form the lattice-work ; which there- fore is thicker, and nearly of an equal form all through. By this ftrudure they are well adapted to their ufes, of af- fording a large enough furface for che mufcles to rife from and move upon, and of defending fufliciently the parts which they inclofe. The round bones have thick ftrong walls in the middle, and become very thin toward their ends 5 which is owing to very few plates feparating at their middle; where, on that account, the cancelli are fo fine and fmall, that they arc not taken notice of: but fuch bones are faid to have a large refervoir of oil in this place. Towards their ends the lattice-work becomes very thick, and rather more complete than in the other fort of bones. â€” Thefe round bones ha- ving ftrong forces naturally applied to them, and being otherwife expofed to violent injuries, have need of a cylin- drical figure to refift external preffure, and of a confiderr able quantity of oil to preferve them from becoming too brittle. Befides which, they are advantageoully provided with thick fides towards their middle, where the greateft forces are applied to injure them ; vi'hile their hollownefs increafes their diameter, and confequently their ftrength to re- fift forces applied to break them tranfverfely {f). Thus, for in- ftance, in eftimating the proportional refiftance of two cylindri- cal bones of unequal diameters, but confifting of an equal num- ber of fimilar fibres uniformly difpofed round each, it is plain, 1. That the abfoluce force of thefe two bones is equal, becaufe they confift of equal numbers of fimilar fibres. 2. 'That the abfolute forces of all the fibres in each bone have (/) Galilei Mechanic, dialog. I.

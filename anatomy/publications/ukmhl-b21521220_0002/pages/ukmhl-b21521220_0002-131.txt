Chapiir. BONES OF THE HEAD. 8(^ pair of nerves and of the condylesbetwixt it and the fphe- noid bone, a cartilage is interpofed. Of the eight bones wdiich belong to the cranlum> there are only two which are not yet defcribed, viz. the ethmo'ii and fphetioid. Thefe we already mentioned, in complai- fance to the generality of writers on this fubjeft, as bones common to the cranium and face, becaufe they enter into the compofition of both -, but the fame reafon might equal- ly be ufed For calling the frontal bone a common one too. I fhall, however, pafs any idle difpute about the propriety of ranging them, and proceed to examine the flru£ture of the bones themfelves, OS ETHMOIDES. Os Ethmoides (?/), or the fteve-lih bone, has got its hame from the great number of fmall holes with which that part of it firll taken notice of is pierced. When this bone is entire, the figure of it is not eafily defcribed; but by a detail of its feveral parts, fome idea may be afforded of the whole ; and therefore I fliall difl.Inguiflr it into the cribriform lamella with its procefs, the nafal lamella, celluLe, and o£a fpougiofa. The thin horizontal lamella is all (except its back-part) ' pierced obliquely by a great number of fmall holes, through which the filaments of the olfactory nerves pafs. In a re- cent fubje£F, thefe holes are fo cloftly lined by the dura mater, that they are much lefs confpicuous than in the fke- leton. From the middle of the internal fide of this plate, a thick procefs rifes upwards; and being higheft at the fore-part, gradually becomes lower as it is extended back- wards. From fome refemblance which this proceft was imagined to.have to a cock’s comb, it h^s been called crijla "VoL* I. iM gal/f («) Cribiiforme, itTtoyyoeiSnc, fpongiforme, cilflatutp, .

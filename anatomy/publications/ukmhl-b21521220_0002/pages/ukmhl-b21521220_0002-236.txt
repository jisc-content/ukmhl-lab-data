Part I. 194 OF THE SKEL'ETON. face is extended outwards, where the pe£loral mufcle has part of its origin. Behind, the bone is made flat and rough by the infertion of the larger fliare of the fubclavian mufcle. After the clavicle begins to be bent backwards, it is round : but it foon after becomes broad and thin ; which fliape it retains to its external end. Along the ex- ternal concavity, a rough fmuoiity runs, from which fome part of the deltoid mufcle takes its rife ; oppofite to this, on the convex, edge, a fcabrous ridge gives infertion to a fhare of the cucullaris mufcle. The upper furface of the clavicle is here flat ; but the lower is hollow, for lod- ging the beginning of the mufculus fubclavlus ; and to- wards its back-part a tubercle rifes to which, and to a roughnefs near it, the ftrong fhort thick ligament, connec- ting this bone to the coracoid procefs of the fcapula, is fixed. The external end [r) of this bone is horizontally oblong, fmooth, doping at the pofleribr fide, and tipped in a recent fubject with a cartilage, for its articulation with the acro- mion fcapulae. Round this the bone is fpongy, for the firmer conne£lion of the ligaments. The medullary arteries having their direfflon obliquely outwards, enter the clavicles by one or more fmall pafTages in the middle of their back-part. The fuhjjance of this bone is the fame as of the other round long bones. The triangular unequal Interior end of each clavicle has the cartilage above deferibed interpofed between it and the irregular cavity of the flernum. The ligaments which furround this articulation to fecure it, are fo fliort and flrong, that little motion can be allowed any way ; and the ftrong ligament that is ftretched acrofs the upper furcula of the fternum, from the pofterior prominent angle of the (r) Era^if. one

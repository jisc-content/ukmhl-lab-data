Th^pijifarwe hands forwards in the palm from the cuneiforme. T.he trapezium is the firh of the fecond row, and is fituated between the fcaphoides and hrh joint of the thumb. The trapezoides is immediately on the outfide of the trapezium.The os vw^Tium is hill more external. The unciforme is farther to the fide of the little finger. Os fcaphoides [b) is the largefi: of the eiglit, excepting one. It is convex above, concave and oblong below: from which fmall refemblance to a boat, it has got its name. Its fmooth convex furface is divided by a rough middle fcha, which runs obliquely crofs it. The upper largeh divifion is articulated with the radius. The common ligament of the joint of the wrih is fixed into the fofla ; and the lower divifion is joined to the trapezium and trapezoides. The concavity receives more than an half of the round head of the os magnum. The external fide of this hollow is formed into a femllunar plane, to be articulated with the following bone. The internal, poflerior, and anterior edges are rough, for fixing the ligaments that connect it to the fur- rounding bones. Os lutiare (c) has a fmooth convex upper furface, by which it is articulated with the radius. The internal fide, which gives jiame to the bone, is in the form of a cref- cent, and is joined with the feaphoid j the lower furface is hollow, for receiving part of the head of the os mag- num. On the outfide of this cavity is another fmooth, but narrow, oblong finuofity, for receiving the upper end of the os unciforme: on the outfide of which a fmall con- vexity is found, for its connection with the os cuneiforme.

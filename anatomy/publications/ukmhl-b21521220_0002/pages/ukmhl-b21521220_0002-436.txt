394 SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. PartIL pofed vis infita deftroyed by the opium ; in the latter, the vis nervea ; for it is evident that the limbs were affeffed by the fympathy of the brain, and of the nervous fyftem in gene- ral, with the nerves of the heart. 3. When the nerve of any mufcle is firft divided by a tranfverfe feftion, and then burnt with a hot iron, or punc- tured with a needle, the mufcle in which it terminates con- trafts violently, exactly in the fame manner as when the ir- ritation is applied to the fibres of the mufcle. But when the hot iron, or needle, is confined to the nerve. Dr Hal- ler himfelf muft have admitted, that the vis nervea, and not the vis infita, was excited. But here I would afk two queftions. F'rrjl^ Whether we do not as well underlland how the vis nervea is excited when irritation is applied to the mufcle as when it is*applied to the trunk of the nerve, the impel- ling power of the mind feeming to be equally wanting in both cafes ? Secondly^ If it appears that irritation applied to the trunk of a nerve excites the vis nervea, why fhould we doubt that it can equally well excite it when applied to the fmall and very fenfiblc branches dnd terminations of the nerve in the mufcle ^ As, therefore, it appears that the fuppofed vis infita is deftroyed or excited by the fame means as the vis nervea; nay, that when, by the application of opium to the heart of a frog, after the aorta is cut, and the circulation inter- rupted, we have deftroyed the vis infita, the vis nervea is fo much extinguifhed, that the animal cannot aÂ£f with the diftant mufcles of the limbs; and that tliefe afterward grow very torpid, or lofe much of their fuppofed vis infita *, it feems clearly to follow, that there is no juft ground for fuppofing that any other principle produces the contradlion of a mufcle, s \ A

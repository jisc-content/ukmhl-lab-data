The articulation of their round heads at the lower ends widi the cavities of the firfl: bones of the fingers, is to be taken notice of here- after. The concavity on the fore-part of thefe metacarpal bones, and the placing their bales on the arched carpus, caufe them to form a hollow in the palm of the hand, which is often ufeful to us. The fpaces between them lodge mufcles, and their fmall motion makes them fit fupport- ers for the fingers to play on. Though the ofla metacarpi fo far agree, yet they may be diftlnguiOied from each other by the following marks. The os mctacarpi iiidkis is generally the longed. Its bafe, which is articulated with the os trapezoldes, is hol- low in the middle. The fmall ridge on the internal fide of this oblong cavity is fmaller than the one oppofite to it, and is made flat on the fide by the trapezium. The exte- rior ridge is alfo fmooth, and flat on its outfide, for its conjmillion with the os magnum; immediately below which a femicircular fmooth flat furface fhews the articulation of this to the fecond metacarpal bone. The back-part of this bafe is flatted where the long head of the extenfor carpi radialis is inferred, and its fore part is prominent where the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is fixed. The external fide of the body of this bone is more hollowed by the aÂ£lion of mufcles than the internal. The tubercle at the internal root of its head is^ larger than the external. Its bafe is fo firmly fixed to the bone it is conneifled with, that it has no motion. ' Os metacarpi medii digiti is generally the fecond in length but often it is as long as the former ; fu^iietimes it is long- er i and it frequently appears only to equal the firfl: by the os magnum being farther advanced downwards than any other bone of the wrifl;. Its bafe is a broad fuperficial ca- , - vity,

We may lay it down as a general rule, notwithflanding foine exceptions, That the bodies of the verttbne are fmall- er, and more folid above; but, as they defcend, they appear larger and more fpongy; and that the cartilages between them are thick, and the furrounding ligaments flrong, in proportion to the fize of the vertebrse, and to the quantity of motion they perform: by which difpofition, the greater weight is fupported on the broadell bell fecured bafc, and the middle of our body is allowed a large and fecure morion. From each fide of the body of each vertebra, a bony bridj. q is produced backwards, and to one fide: from the pofterior end of which one flanting prqccfs rifes, and another defcends', the fmooth, and what is generally the flattell, fide ©f each of thefe four proceflcs, which are called the oblique (;;), is cover- ed witli a fmooth cartilage j and the two lower ones of each vertebra are fitted to, and articulated with, the two upper ‘or afcending oblique procefles of the vertebra below, having their articular ligaments fixed into the rough line round theif edges. From between the oblique procefles of each fide, the ver- tebra is (Iretched out laterally into a procefs that is named tratifoerfe. From the back-part of the roots of the two oblique and of the tranfverfe procefs of each fide, a broad oblique bony plate is extended backwards; where thefe meet, the feventh pro- cefs of the vertebrre takes it rife, and ftands out back- wards: this being generally fliarp pointed and narrow-edged, it has therefore been called fpinal procefs; from which this whole chain of bones has got its name. Befides the common ligament which lines all the inter- nal furface of the fpinal procefles, as well as of the bodies, particular ligaments conne£l the bony biidges and procefles of the contiguous vertebrae together.

OF MUSCULAR MOTIOJ^. 383 Part II. confiflient with anatomical truth, which demonftrates the lead vifible fibres to be cylindrical, and in no part veficu- lar; it is lilcewife repugnant to the celerity with which mufcular motion is performed ; and it feems to be com- pletely refuted by the well-known faff, that the bulk of a mufcle is rather diminilhed than increafed during its, ac- tion. Aeain, the inflation of rhomboidal chains in the fibres is equally repugnant to the celerity of mufcular mo- tion, and to anatomy; they would alfo occafion an Im- menfe wafte of ftrength, and after all render the mufcle but little fliorter. The nerves want that irritable nature which is obferved in the mufcular fibre, Finally, it is by no means demonflrable, that the fibres, from fo few nerves, can be fo numerous, or diflributcd in fo many dilFerent tranfverfe direflions, with refpedl to the mufcular threads, as thofe hypothefes require to be allowed. A complication of the nerves round the extremities of fibres, fo as to con- traft them by their eladlcity, is founded upon a falfe druc- ture of the mufeula.r fibre, fuppofing the nerves to be di- dributed, where filaments of the cellular fubdance only can be demondrated. _ Moreover, the phenomena of ani- mals, which, having neitlier brain nor nerves, are yet very apt for motion, apparently demondrate the intrinfic fabric of the mufcles to be fuflicient for their motion, without other affidance from the nerves. Other explanations, de- rived from fpherules of air in the blood, are founded on a falfe hypothefis, for the blood contains no eladic air. (See article Refpiration). The animal fpirits are not of the na- ture of an eledlric torrent. If we may add any thing to thefe phenomena, we may fuppofe the nervous fluid to be of a dimulating nature, by which means it forces the elementary particles of the mul- cular fibre to approach nearer to each other. The motive caufe which occafions the influx of the animal fpirits into the

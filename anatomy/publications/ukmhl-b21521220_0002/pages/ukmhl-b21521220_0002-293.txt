Metatarsus (o) is compofed of five bones, which, in I their general charafters, agree with the metacarpal bones ; but may be diflinguUhed from them by the following marks: i. They are longer, thicker, and ftronger. 2. Their anterior round ends are not fo broad, and are lefs in proportion to their bafes. 3. Their bodies are fharper above and flatter on their fides, with their inferior ridge inclined more to the outfide- 4. The tubercles at the lower part of the round head are larger. The firft or internal metatarfal bone is eafily diftinguifhed from the reft by its thicknefs. The one next to it is the longeft, and with its fliarp edge almoft perpendicular. The others are fhorter and more oblique, as their fituation is more external. Which general remarks, with the defcrlptiori I am now to give of each, may teach us to diftinguiih them from each other. Os metatarji pollkis is by far the thickeft and ftrongeft, as having much the greateft weight to fuftain. Its bafe is oblong, irregularly concave, and of a femilunar figure, to be adapted to the os cuneiforme maximum. The inferior edge of this bafe is a little prominent and rough, where the tendon of the peronasus primus mufcle is inferted. On its outfide an oblique circular depreflTion is made by the fecond metatarfal bone.

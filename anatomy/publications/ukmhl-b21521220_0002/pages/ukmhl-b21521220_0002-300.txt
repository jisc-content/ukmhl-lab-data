258 OF THE BONES. Part j The fuperior cartilages of the ribs foonet ofGfy, to fupport tlie weight of the mammae. The middle cartilages are more flat and broad by the weight of the breafts. The inferior cartilages are longer, for enlarging the '' cheft. Weak women, who have borne many children when young, often have the vertehrs of their back bent forwards, ' and their Jlermtm depreffed, or become round-fliouldered and flat-breafled (i), by the preflure and weight of the im- pregnated uterus, and by the ftrong a£lion of the abdominal mufcles. The os facrum is broader, and turned much more back-, wards, for enlarging the pelvis. The os coccygis is more moveable, and much lefs bent for- wards, to facilitate the birth. The o^a ilium are more hollow, and more refle61;ed out- wards, and confequently further removed from each other, in order to widen the lower part of their abdomen, and for the better fupport of the impregnated uterus. The ridge on the upper part of the os pubis is larger in fuch women as have borne children, being extended by the ftrong action of the mufcuH re£H abdominis. The cartilage between the two ofla pubis efpecially in women who have borne children, is thicker than in men, by which the pelvis is more capacious in females^ The conjoined fur faces of the offi pubis and of the ofpi innominata and Jacrum, are lefs, the angle under the fym- phyfts of the offapubis, is mqch larger, and the arches formed below and behind by the offa ilium and ifchium are wider, which, with the ftraighter os facrum^ and more diftant /«- bera ifchiiy leave a larger paflage for the exclufion of the child in birth. {b) Chefelden, Anatomy, book I.cliay. l.

IN GENERAL. 3^ Chap. I. would have been much thLker in adults, had not this for- cible caufe been applied, which has not had fuch effe£l:s in children, whofe mufcles have not been much exercifcd.— Befides, if we allow ihat all the parts of a bone are equal- ly increafdd by the conftant fupply of new particles, each fibre, and every particle of a fibre, .endeavours to make way for its own growth, by pufliing the one next to it; and confequently by far the greatefl preflure is oh the mid- dle, to make the particles firm, and therefore to begin their olTification there. Lallly, the pulfation of the me- dullary arteries, which enter the bones near to this middle part, may, as authors have alledged, contribute perhaps fomewhat to this induration. From the elFedbs of preflure only it Is that we can ac* count for the bones of old people having their fides much thinner, yet more denfe and folid, while the cavities are much larger than in thofe of young people; and for the prints of mufcles, veflcls, &c. being fo much more flrong- ly marked on the furfaecs of the former than of the latter, if they belong to people of near the fame condition in life. —Preflure mnll likewife be the caufe which, in people of equal ages, make thefe prints ftronger in the bones of thofe w'ho had much labour and cxercife, than they ard in people who have led an indolent and Ina£llve life.

Whence, in hot countries, the in- habitants fooner come to tlieir height of ftature than In the northerly cold regions: And thence feems to have ari- fen the common pradblce among the ladles, of making pup- pies drink brandy or fpirit of wine, and of bathing them in thefe liquors, to prevent their growing big.

(Chap. II. ♦ BONES OF THE TRUNK. rpi men downwards. The arched part of the ribs being tlius moved outwards, their anterior ends and the dernum being advanced forwards, and the diaphragm being brought nearer to a plain furface, inftcad of being greatly convex on each fide within each cavity of the thorax, it is evident how confidcrably the cavity, of which the nine or ten up- per ribs are the fides, mud be widened, and -made deeper and longer. While this is doing in the upper r&s, the lower ones wdiofe cartilages are not joined to the fternum or to other cartilages, move very differently, though they confpire to the fame intention, the enlargement of the tho» rax: for having no fixed point to which their anterior ends are faflened, and the diaphragm being inferted into them at the place where it runs nearly flraight upwards from its origin at the vertebrae, thefe ribs are drawn downwards by this flrong mufcle, and by the mufcles of the abdomen, which at this time refifl the ftretching force of the bowels ; while the intcrcoftal mufcles are pulling them in the contrary dire£lion, to wit, upwards. The efl'e<T there- fore, of either of thefe powers, which are antagonifls to each other, is very little, as to moving the ribs eitlier up or down ; but the mufcles of the abdomen, puflied at this time outwards by the vifeera, carry thefe ribs along with them. Thus the thorax is not only not allowed to be fliortened, but is really widened at its lower part, to affifl in making fufficient fpace for the due diJlsntion of the lungs. As foon as the action of thefe feveral mufcles ceafes, the claftic cartilages, extending themfclves to their natural fi- tuation, deprefs the upper ribs, and the fternum fubfides ; the diaphragm is thruft up by the vifeera abdominalia, and the oblique and traxifverfe mufcles of the belly ferve to draw the inferior ribs inwards at the fame time.

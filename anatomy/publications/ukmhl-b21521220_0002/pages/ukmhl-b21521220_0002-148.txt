' _ Each of thofe bones is joined, above, to the frontal bone, by part of the tranlverfe future;—behind to the os planum of the ethmoid bone, by the fame future;—before, and be- low, to the maxillary bone, by the lacrymal future. In- ternally, the ofla unguis cover fome of the fmus ethmoidales ; nay, are really continuous with the bony lamellae which make up the fides of thefe cells; fo that they are as much ' part of the ethmoid bone as tlie ofla plana. Thefe unguiform bones compofe the interior internal parts of the orbits, lodge a fhare of the lacrymal fac and du£l, and cover the ethmoid cells. Their fituation and tender fub- flance make a rafli operator in danger-of dedroying a confider-? able fliare of the organ of fmelling, when he is performing the operation of the fiflula lacrymalis ; but when thefe bone§ are hurt, they cafl. off without much difficulty, and confe- quently the wound is foon cured, unlefs the patient labours under a general cacoethes, or there is a predifpofition in the bones to caries ; in which cafe, a large train of bad fymptoms follow, or at bed the cure proves tedious. The bones are fplly formed in a new-born child. OSSA MALARUM. / Ossa Malarum (/) was the name given by Celfus, as was already remarked, to all the upper jaw, but is now appro- priated to the prominent fquarc bones which form the cheek on each fide. Before, their furface is convex and fmooth; backward, it is unequal and concave, for lodging part of the crotaphyte mufcles. The four angles of each of thefe bones have been reckoned procelfes (/) Jiigalia vcl xygomatica, bypopia, fubocularia.

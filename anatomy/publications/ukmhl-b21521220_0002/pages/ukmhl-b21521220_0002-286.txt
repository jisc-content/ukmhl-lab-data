244 OF THE skeleton. Part T. play on the internal malleolus. The external fule has alfo fuch a furface, but larger, for its articulation with the ex- ternal malleolus. Round the bafe of this head there is a rough folTa ; and immediately before the head, as alfo below' its internal fmoolh furface, we find a confiderable rough cavity. The lower furface of the afiragalus is divided by an ir- regular deep rough folhi; which at its internal end is nar- row, but gradually widens as it llretches obliquely out- wards and forwards. The fnrooth furface, covered with cartilage, behind this fofla, is large, oblong, extended in the fame oblique fituation with the fofla, and concave for its conjun6Uon with the os calcis. The back-part of the edge of this cavity is produced into two ftiarp-pointed rough procelTes ; between which is a depreflion made by the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus.—^The lower fur- face before the folTa is convex, and compofed of three dlf- tin£t fmooth planes.—-The long one behind, and the ex- terior or fliortefl:, are articulated with the heel-bone ; while the internal, which is the mofl; convex of the three, refts and moves upon a cartilaginous ligament, that is conti- nued from the calcaneum to the os fcapholdes. Without which ligament the aftragalus could not be fullained ; but would be prefled out of its place by the great weight it fupports, and the other bones of the tarfus would be fepa- rated. Nor would a bone be fit here, becaufe it mufl; have been thicker than could conveniently be allowed ; otherwife it would break, and w'ould not prove fuch an eafy bending bafe, to leflen the fliock which is given to the body in leaping, running, &c. The fore-part of this bone is formed into a convex ob- long fmooth head, called by fome its procefsy which is re- ceived by the os naviculare. Ropnd the root of this head, efpecially

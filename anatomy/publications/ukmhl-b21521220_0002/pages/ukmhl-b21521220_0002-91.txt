Upon prefling any of thefe glands with the finger, a inucilaginous liquor may be fqueezed out of their excretc- nes, which fomewhat refembles the white of an egg or fe- rum of the blood; but it is,manifeftly fiik to the tafte. It does not coagulate by acids nor by heat, as the ferum does ; but by the latter turns firfl; thinner, and, when evaporated, leaves only a thin fait film. The quantity of this mucilage, conftantly fupplied, mufl be very confiderable, fince we fee what a plentiful trouble- fome difeharge of glary matter follows a wound or ulcer of any joint: of which liquor the mucilage is a confider- able part. The veflels which fupply liquors for making the fecre- tion of this mucilage, and the veins which bring back the blood remaining after the fecretion, may be feen without any preparation; and, after a tolerable injedUon of the ar- teries, the glands are covered with them. In a found ftate, we are not confeious of any fenfibillty in thofe glands: but, in fome cafes which I have feen, when they inflame and fuppurate, the mod racking pain is felt in them; a melancholy, though a fure, proof that they have nervesi Thefe mucilaginous glands are commonly lodged in a cellular fubftance; which is alfo to be obferved in other parts of the bag formed by the ligaments of the ardcula- tion; and which contains a fatty matter, that mull necelfa- rily be attenuated, and forced through the including mem- branes into the, cavity of the joint, by the preffure v.diich it fuffers from the moving bones.

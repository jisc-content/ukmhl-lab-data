The fubjlance of the ribs is fpongy, cellular, and only covered with a very thin external lamellated furface, which increafes ih thicknefs and Ilrength as it approaches the ver- tebrae. To the fore-end of each rib a long, broad, and ftrong cartilage is fixed, and reaches thence to the fternum, or is joined to the cartilage of the next rib. 'I'his courfe, how- ever, is not in a ftraight line with the rib : for the carti- lages generally make a confiderable curve, the concave part of which is upwards ; therefore, at their infertion into the fternum, they make an obtufe angle above, and an acute one below.—*—Thefe cartilages are of fuch a length as ne- ver to allow the ribs to come to a right angle with the fpine ; but they keep them fituated fo obliquely as to make the angle very confiderably obtufe, above, till a force ex- ceeding the elafticity of the cartilage is applied.—Thefe car- tilages, as all others, arc firmer and harder internally than they are ©n their external furface ; and fometimes in old people, all their tniddle fubftance becomes bony, while a thin cartilaginous lamella appears externally (p). The of- fification, however, begins frequently at the external fur- face.—The greateft alternate motions of the cartilages being made at their great curvature, that part remains frequently cartilaginous after all the reS: is oflified (q).

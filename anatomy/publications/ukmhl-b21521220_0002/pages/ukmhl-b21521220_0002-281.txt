The principal ufe of this bone is to afford origin and In- fertion to mufcles; the diredion of which may be a little altered on proper occafions, by its upper part flmffling backwards and forwards. It Ilkewlfe helps to make the articulation of the foot more fecure and firm. The ends of the tibia and fibula being larger than their middle, a fpace is here left, which is filled up with fneh another liga- ment as I have defcrlbed extended between the bones of the fore-arm; and which is alfo difeontinued at its upper part, where the tibialis antlcus immediately, adheres to the folxus and tibialis pofticus ; but every where elfe it gives origin to mufcular fibres (o). Both the ends of this bone are cartilaginous in a ripe child, and affuine the form of appendices before they are united to its body. R O T U L A. Rotula (/>) is the fmall flat bone fituated at the fore- part of the joint of the knee. Its fhape refembles the common figure of the heart with its point downwards. The anterior convex fujface of the rotula is pierced by a great number of holes, into which fibres of the flrong li- , gament, that is fpread over it, enter. Behind, its furface is fmooth, covered' with cartilage, and divided by a middle convex ridge into two cavities, of which the external is largeft ; and both are exadly adapted to the pulley of the os femoris, on which they are placed in the mod ordinary undraining poftures of the leg^: but w'hen the leg is much and («) Wcitbrecht, Syndefmolog. p. 156.

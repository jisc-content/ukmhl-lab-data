Its infule has a flat conoidal furface, where it is contiguous to the preceding bone. When we ftand, the fore-ends of thefe metatarfal bones, 'and the os calcis, are our only fupporters •, and therefore it is neceflary That they fliould be ftrong, and lliould' have tt confined motion. TOES. The bones of the toes are nearly fimilar to thofe of the thumb and fingers; particularly the two of the great, toe are precifely formed as the two lafl; of the thumb; only their pofition, in refpe£l of the other toes, is .not oblique; and they are porportionally 'much flronger, becaufe they are fubjeded to a greater force ; for they fuftain the force with which our bodies are puflied forwards by the foot be- hind at every ftep we make; and on them principally the weight of the body is fupported, when we are raifed on our tip-toes. The three bones in each of the other four toes, compa- red to thofe of the fingers, diflbr from them in thefe par- ticulars. They are lefs and fmaller in proportion to their lengths : Tlieir bafes are much larger than their anterior ends: Their bodies are more narrow above than below, and flatter on the fides. The firfl: phalanx is proportionally much longer than the bones of the fecond and third, which are verv fliort. ^ Of the four, the toe next to the great one has the largeft bones in all dimenfions, and more externally the toes are lefs

Parti. 64 OF THE SKELETON. its procefles, '^hich infinuate themfelves into this conjunc- tion of the bones; for doing this equally, and where the greateft nccefhty of adhcfion is, the futures are difpofed at nearly equal diftances; and the larger refervoirs of blood, the fmufes, are under or near them. 5. That fractures might be prevented from reaching fo far as they would in a continued bony fubftance. 6. That the connexion at 'the futures being capable of yielding, the bones might be al- lowed to feparate ; which has given great relief to patients from the violent fymptoms which they had before this fe- paration happened [g). And it feems reafonable to be- lieve, that the opening of the futures was of great benefit to feveral others who were rather thought to have been liurt by it (/j) : for the confequences of fuch a force acting upon the brain, as was capable of thrulling the bones afun- der, mult have been fatal, unlefs it had been thus yielded to. Having gone through the general ftrufture of the crani- um, I now proceed to examine each bone of which that brain-cafe confifts, in the order in which I firft named them. OS FRONTIS. The os frontis {i) has its name from its being the only bone of that part of the face we call the forehead, though it reaches a good deal farther. It has fome referablance in fliape to the fhell of the concha bivalvis, commonly called the ccckle: for the greateft part of it is convex externally, and concave internally, with a ferrated circular edge ; while the {gj Ephemerid.

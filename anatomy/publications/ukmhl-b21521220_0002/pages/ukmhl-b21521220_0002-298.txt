fj ( 25^ 5 The APPENDIX. K Marks of a FEMALE Skeleton^ 1 TO finifli the defcnptiori of the bones, is gerferally toi contlude the oftcology: but, that no part of the fubjedl may be left untouched, I think it necelTary to fub- join the diftingullhing marks of the Male and Female Ike- letons ; and I have chofen to illuflrate them principally iti the latter; becaufe women having a more delicate confti- tution, and aflbrding lodging and nourilhment to their ten- der foetufes till they have fufFicient ftrength and firmnefs to bear the injuries of the atmofphere, and contaifl of other more folid fubftances, their bones are frequently in- complete, and always of a make in forne parts of the body different from thofe of the robufl: male ; which agree to the defeription already given, unlefs where the proper fpe- cialifies of the female were particularly remarked which could not be done in all places where they occur, without perplexing the order of this treatife : Therefore I choofe rather to fum them up here by way of appendix. The caufes of the following I’pecialities of the female bones may be reduced to thefe three : i. *A weak lax conftitution. 2. A fedentary una£llve life, increafing that conllitution. 3. A proper frame for being mothers. The bones of women are fmaller in proportion to their length than thofe of men; becaufe the force of their mufcles is not fo great, nor is fuch ftrong external force applied to them to prevent thch ftretchiog out in length.

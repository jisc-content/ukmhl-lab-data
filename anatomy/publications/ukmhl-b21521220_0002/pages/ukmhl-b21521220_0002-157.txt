BONES OF THE HEAD. crefcent, and thick, for the firm conne£lion of the velum pendulum palati; the Internal point being produced back- wards, to afford origin to the pidato-flaphylinus or azy- gos mufcle. This fquare bone is well diftinguiflied from the pt.erygoid procefs by a perpendicular folfa, which applied to fuch another in the maxillary bone, forms a pafTige for the palatine branch of the fifth pair of nerves *, and by another fmall hole behin this, through which a twig of the fame nerve p.ilTes. The piirygoiH practfs is fomewhat triangular, having a broad bafe, and ending fmaller above. The back-part of this procefs has three folTse formed in it; the two lateral receive the ends of the two plates of the fphenoid bone, that arc commonly compared to a bat’s wing •, the middle foffa makes up a part of what is commonly called the fajja ptcrygoidca i the fore-fide of this palatine pterygoid procefs is an irregular concave, where it receives the back-part of the great tuberofity of the maxillary bone. Frequently feveral fmall holes may be obferved in this triangular procefs, parti- cularly one near the middle of its bafe, which a little above communicates with the common and proper holes of this bone already mentioned. The nafal lamella of this bone is extremely thin and brit- tle, and rlfes upwards from the tipper fide of the external edge of the fquare bone, and from the narrow extremity of the pterygoid procefs •, where it is fo weak, and at the fame time fo firmly fixed to the maxillary bone, as to be very liable to be broken in feparating the bones. From the part where the plate rifes, it runs up broad on the infide of the tuberofity of the maxillary bone, to form a confi- derable fliare of the fides of the maxillary finus, and to clofe up the fpace between the fphenoid and the great bulge of the maxillary bone, where there would otherwife be a large flit opening into the noflrils {g).

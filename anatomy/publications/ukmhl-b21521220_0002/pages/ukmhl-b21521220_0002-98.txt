Pairt t* OF THE SKELETON. perfAntilng the operation of the trepan; fince, in a patient Vvhofe cranium has thefc pits, the dura mater and brain may be injured, before .the inftrument has pierced near tlie ordinary thicknefs of a table of the fkull. The internal bafe of the fkull is extremely unequal, for lodging the fe- veral.parts and appendices of the brain and cerebellum, and allowing paflage and defence to the velTels and nerves that go into or come out from thefe parts. The bones of the cranium are compofed of two tables* and intermediate cancelli, commonly called their diploe [e). The external table is thickeft; the inner, from its thinnefs and confequent brittlenefs, has got the name of vitrea. Whence we may fee the reafon of thofe mifehievous con- fequences which fo often attend a colleiSlIon of matter in the diploe, either from an external ot internal caufe, be- fore any fign of fuch a colledlion appears in the teguments which cover that part of the fkull where is lodged [f). The diploe has nearly the fame texture and ufes in the fkull with the cancelli in other bones. The diploe of feveral old fubjefts Is fo obliterated, that fcarce any veflige of It can be feen ; neither is it obfervable in fome of the hard craggy bones at the bafe of the fkull. Hence an ufeful caution to furgeons who trufl to the bleeding, want of refiflance, and change of found, as cer- tain marks, in the operation of the trepan, that their in- ftrument has fawed through the firft table, and reached the diploe (g). In other people, the diploe becomes of a monftrous thicknefs, while the tables of the fkull are thin- ner than paper. The cranium confifts of eight bones, fix of which are faid to be proper, and the other two are reckoned com- mon (e) MedituHum, commilTura. (f) Boneti Sepulcliret. anat. lib. I. § I. obf. 96.—103.

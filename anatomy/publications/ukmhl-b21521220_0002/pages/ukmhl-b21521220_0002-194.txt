Befides the revolution on this axis, tlie firft vertebra can move a fmall way to either fide; but is prevented from moving backwards of forwards by its an- terior arch, and by the crofs ligament, wdiich are both clofely applied to the tooth-Uke procefs. Motion forwards here would have been of very bad confequence, as it w-ould have brought the beginning of the fpinal marrow upon the point of the tooth-like procefs. The rotatory motion of the head is of great ufe to us on many accounts, by allowing us to apply quickly the or- gans of the fenfes to objecTs : And the axis of rotation was altogether proper to be at this place ; for, if it had been at a greater dlllance from the head, the weight of the head, if it had at any time been removed from a perpendicular bear- ing to the fmall very moveable joint, and thereby had ac- quired a long lever, w'culd have broken the ligaments at every turn inconfiderately performed, or thefe ligaments mud; have been formed much ftronger, and confequently Could not liave been connected to fuch fnvill bones. Neither could this circular motion be performed on the firft vertebra without danger, becaufe the immoveable part of the medulla oblongata is fo near, as, at each large turn, the beginning the fpinal marrow would have been in danger of being twifted, and of fuffering by tlie cornpreftion this vi'buld have made on its tender fibrils. It is necedâ€™ury to obferve, that the lateral or moderator iisraments confined fo much the motion of the firft verte-, O bra upon the fecond, that though this joint may ferve us on feveral occafions, yet we are often obliged to turn our faces farther round than could be done by this joint alone, without the greateft danger of twilling the fpinal marrow- too much, and alfo of luxating the oblique proceffes: therefore, in large turns of this kindj- the rotation is af- fifted

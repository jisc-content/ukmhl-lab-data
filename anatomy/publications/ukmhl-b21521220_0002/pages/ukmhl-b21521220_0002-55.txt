Chap. !• INGENERAL. 13 ^ the body, that there are alfo veins in the bones; and the difappearing of the tinfture of madder, after the bones of living animals are coloured with it, could not be with- out fuch veins to carry it away; nay, the veins of bones can fometimes be injetfled, and then feen (//). The bones of a living animal are fo hifenfible, that they can be cut, rafped, or burnt, without putting the creature to pain, and the nerves dihributed in their fubftance can- not be (hewn by difledfion ; from which it might be infer- red that they have no nerves dihributed'to them : but the general tenor of nature, which bellows nerves to-all other parts fliould prevent our drawing fuch a conclufion. And if fenfibility is a fure proof of nerves entering into the compofition of any part, as it is generally allowed to be, we have fufhcient evidence of nerves here in the bones; for the granulated red flelli which fprouts out from them, after an amputation of a limb, or performing the operation of the trepan, or after an exfoliation, is exquifitely fenfible; and in fome ulcers of bones, where the periolleum was all ft- parated, the patient fulFercd racking pain, if the bone was touched with a rough inllrumcnt ; nor was he free from pain after the bone was perforated (0). The reafon why the nerves of rigid hard bones become infenfibfe, is, that all nerves muft have a confiderable degree of flexibility at the part where an objedl is applied, otherwife they can- not be alFedled by its impreflions. We fee this illuftratcd in a very common analogous cafe, the growth of a new nail; when the former one has fuppurated off, the thin membrane which fir ft appears, is exquifitely fe/ifiblt; but gradually be- comes dull in its fenfation, till it can be cut or fcraped, with- out caufing pain, after it is formed into a hard nail.

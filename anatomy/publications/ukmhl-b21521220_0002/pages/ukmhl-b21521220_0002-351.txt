The fuperior or Greater Mufcle of the Diaphragm, Anfes^ by difliniTt flelhy fibres, from the cartilago enfi- formis, from the cartilages of the feventh, and of all the inferior ribs on both lides. The fibres from the cartilago enliformis, and from the feventh and eighth ribs, run ob- liquely upwards and backwards ; from the ninth and .tenth, tranfverfely inwards and upwards; and from the eleventh andT twelfth, obliquely upwards. From thefe different origins the fibres run, like radii from the circumference to the centre of a circle ; and are lufertedxnto a cordiform tendon, of a confiderable breadth, which is fituated in the middle ofâ€˜the diaphragm, and^in which, therefore, the fibres from oppofite fides are interlaced. Towards the right fide the tendon is perforated, by a tri- angular hole, for the paflage ot the vena cava iiiferior ; and to the upper convex part of it the pericardium and mediafti- num are conneifled. 2. The inferior, Leffer mufcle, or Appendix of the D I A H R A G M, Arifest from the fecond, third, and fourth lumbar verte- brae, by eight heads ; of which two in the middle, com- monly called its crura, are the longeft, and begin tendinous. Between the crura, the aorta and thoracic duct pafs ; and, on the outfide of thefe, the 'great fympathetic nerves and branches of the vena azygos perforate the fliortcr heads, riie mufcular fibres run obliquely upwards and forwards, and form in the middle two.flcfliy columns, which dccuffate and leave an oval fpace between them for the paffage of the oefo- phagus and eighth pair of nerves.

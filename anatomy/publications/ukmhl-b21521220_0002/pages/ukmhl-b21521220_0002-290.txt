The os naviculape is wholly cartilaginous in a new-born infant. ‘ Os cuboidei (z) is a very irregular cube Behind, it is formed into an oblong unequal concavity, adapted to the fore-part of the os cakis. On its internal fide, there is a frnall femicircular fmooth cavity, to join the os naviculare. Immediately before’ which, an oblong fmooth plane is '.made by the os cuneiforme externum. Below this the bone is hollow and rough.- On the internal fide of the lower furface a round protuberance and fofTa are found, where the inufeulus adductor pollicis has its origin. On the ex-= ternal fide of this fame furface, there is a round knob, co- vered with cartilage ; immediately before which a fmooth fofia may be obferved, in which the tendon of the pero- nxus primus runs obliquely crofs the foot; and on the knob the thin flat cartilage proper to this mufcle plays; in place of which fometimes a bone is found : More external- ly than the knob, a rough hollow is made, for the ftrong ligaments ftretched between this bone and the os calcis. — Before, the furface of the os cuboides is flat, fmooth, and flightly divided into two planes, for fuftainlng the os mctatarfi of the little toe, and of the toe next to it. The form of the back-part of the os cuboides, and the li- gaments connecling the joint with os calcis, both concur in allowing little motion in this part. The oflfification of this bone is fcarcely began at the birth. Os cuneiforme exiernum {a)f if we regard its fituatiqn or medium by its bulk, is much of the fhape of a wedge, be- ing.

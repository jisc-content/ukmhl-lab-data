The bafe of the firft grinder has an edge pointed in the middle, on its outfide, refembling the canini; from which it Hopes inwards till it, rifes again into a point.—It has gene- ncrally but one root, which fometimes is long and crooked at its point. The fecond dens molaris has two points on its bafe, rifing nearly equally on its out and infide. It has two roots, ei- ther feparate or run together, but Ihorter than the root of the firft. Thefe two anterior grinders are much fmaller than the three that are placed farther back in the mouth. The third and fourth are very broad in their bales, with four or five point? ftanding out; and they have three or more roots. The fifth, commonly called dens fapienth (y), from its coming through the gums later than the other grinders, has four points on its bafe, which is not fo large as the bafe of the third and fourth, and its roots are lefs nume- rous. The incifores of the upper jaw being broader than thofe of the lower jaw, make the fuperior grinders to be placed fo much farther back than the lower ones, that, when they are brought together, by (hutting the mouth, the points of the grinders of the one jaw enter into the depre- fions of the oppolite grinders, and they are all equally ap- plied to each other, notwithftanding the inequality of their furface. The numerous roots of the dentes molares prevent their loofening by the lateral preflure they fuffer in grinding; and as the fockets in the upper jaw are more fpongy, and the (y>) Lettre fur I’orteologie. ^oifpovis'tjptCt pccvr»ptC) .O'ptyovot, ScnFiis, intcllcflus, fcrontini, artatcni corrplentes, gsnuini, moderatarcs.

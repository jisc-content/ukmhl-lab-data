•238 OF THE SKELETON. Parti. then in a£lion on the veflels, before they enter the bones, is fufficient to compenfate the difadvantage of their courfe. This reafoning feems to be dill enforced, by obferving, that this paflage is always nearer the upper than the lower ends of thefe bones. Fhe lower end of the fibula is extended into a fpongy oblong head ; on the Infide of which is a convex, irregu- lar, and frequently a fcabrous, furface, that is received by the external hollow of the tibia, and fo firmly joined to it by a very thin intermediate cartilage and ftrong ligaments, that it fcarcc can move. Below this the fibula is flretched out into a fmooth coronoid procefs, covered with cartilage on its internal fide, and is there contiguous to the outfidc of the firft bone of the foot, the aftragalus, to fecure the articulation. This procefs, named malleolus, externus, be- ing Gtuated farther back than the internal malleolus, and in an oblique diredion, obliges us naturally to turn the fore-part of the foot outwards (w). At the lower inter- nal part of this procefs, a fpongy cavity for mucilaginous glands may be remarked; from its point ligaments are ex- tended to the aftragalus, os calcis, and os naviculare, bones of the foot; and from its infide fhort ftrong ones go out- to the,aftragalus. On the back part of it a finuofity is inade by the tendons of the peronaei mufcles. When the ligament extended over thefe tendons from the one fide of ihe depreflion to the other is broken, flretched too much, or made weak by a fprain, the tendons frequently ftart forwards to the outfide of the fibula. The- conjunction of the upper end of the fibula with the tibia is by plain furfaCes tipped with cartilage; and at its lower end the cartilage feems to glue the two bones toge- ther ; not, however, fo firmly in young people, but that the motion at the other end of fuch a long radius is very obfervable.

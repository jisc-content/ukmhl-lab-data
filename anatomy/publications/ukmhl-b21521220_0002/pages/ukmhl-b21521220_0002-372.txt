Infraspinatus, ArifeSy flefhy, from all that part of the bafe of the fca- pula that Is between its fpine and inferior angle ; from the fpiue as far as the cervix of the fcapula. The fibres afcend and defcend obliquely towards a tendon in the middle of the mufcle, which runs forwards, and adheres to the capfular li- gament.

It ferves befides to tlrengthen their aclions, and keeps them from fwelling too much outwardly when in action. 3. Teres Minor, Artfesy flefhy, from all the round edge of the inferior cofta of the fcapula, and runs forwards along the inferior edge of the infrafpinatus mufcle, and adheres to the liga- ment. Itifertedy tendinous, into the back-part of the large protu- berance on the head of the .os humeri, a little behind and below the termination of the lafl named mufcles. Ufe. To roll the humerus outwards ; to draw the hume- rus backwards; and to prevent the ligament from being pinched between the bones. Along the inferior cofla of the fcapula is, Teres

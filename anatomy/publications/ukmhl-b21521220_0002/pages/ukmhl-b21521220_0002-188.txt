146 OF THE SKELETON. Part I. % The cartilages between thefc vertebrae are thick, efpecial- ly at their fore-part; which is one reafon why the vertebrae advance forward as they defcend, and have larger motion. The oblique proccfles of thefe bones of the neck more jullly defeirv'e that name than thofe of any other vertebrae. They art fituated Wanting; the upper ones having their fmoo.th and almoft fiat furfaces facing obliquely backwards and upwards, while the inferior oblique proceffes have thefe lurfaces facing obliquely forwards and downwards. The tranfvcrfe proceffes of thefe vertebrae are framed in a different manner from thofe of any other bones of the fpine; For, befides the common tranfvcrfe procefs rifmg from between the oblique proceffes of each fide, there is a fecohd one tliat comes out from the fide of the body of each vertebra j and thefe two proceffes, after leaving a cir- cular hole for the paffage of the cervical artery and vein, unite, and are confiderably hollowed at their upper part, with rifing fides, ,to proteft the netwes that pafs in the hollow ; and at lafl each fide terminates in an obtufe point, for the in- fertion of mufcles. The fpinal proceffes of thefe cervical bones ftand nearly ffraight backwards, are fliorter than thofe of any other ver- tebrse, and are forked or double at their ends ; and hence allow a more convenient infertion to mufcles. The thick cartilag-es between the bodies of thefe cervical vertebrae, the obliquity of their oblique proceffes, and the fliortnefs and horizontal fituatlon of their fpinal procefles, all confpire to allow them large motion. The holes between the bony crofs bridges, for the paffage of the nerves from the fpinal marrow, have their largefl fhare formed in the loweft of the two vertebrae, to which they are common. So far mofl: of the cervical vertebrae agree ; but they have

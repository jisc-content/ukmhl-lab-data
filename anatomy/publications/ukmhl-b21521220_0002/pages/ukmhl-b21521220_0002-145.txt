Cliap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. 103 the lower part of the feptum narium to between the two middle dentes incifores. The longitudinal palate future (r) ftretches from the middle of the foremoll teeth through the middle of all the palate. ' The tranfverfe palate future (j) runs acrofs the palate, near- er the back than the fore part of it. Each of the two palato.maxillary is at the back-part of the fide of each noflrils. The fifteenth is the fpinous, which is in the middle of the lower part of the noftrils. This may perhaps be rather thought a double fcindylefis. The connedlion of the ofla fpongiofa to the fide of each noftril, is fo much by a membrane in young l'ubjeÂ£ls, by a fort of hook and afterwards by concretion or union of fubftance in adults, that I did not know well how to rank it : But if any chufes to call it a future, the addition of two tranfverfe nnfalfutures may be made to thofe above named. The futures of the face (formerly called harmom<e) have not fuch confpicuous indentations as thofe of the Ikull ; the bones here not having fubftance enough for form- ing large indentations, and there being lefs necelfity for fecurity againll external injuries, or any internal pro- truding force, than in the cranium. Thefe futures often difappear in old people, by the bones running into each other; which can do little prejudice, becaufe the princi- pal ufe of die bones being fo numerous here, is to allow them to be extended into a pr9per form. It is evident, from the manner of the conjunftion of' thefe bones, that they can have no motion, except in com- mon with the cranium. The purpofes which this pile of bones ferves, will be (hown in the defeription which I am going to give of each pf them. OSSA (r) Laquearis, palataria rcila. (d Arcuata, palatina poflica.

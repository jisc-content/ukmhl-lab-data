Part I. 38 OF THE BONES. 3. Ginglimiis (f), which properly fignifies the hinge of a door or window; in it the parts of the bones mutually receive and are received, and allow of motion two ways: Workmen call it charnal. The gingUmus is generally divided into three kinds; to which fome [d) give the name of contiguous (e), dijlant [f)y and compound [g). The firft kind of ginglimus is when a bone has feveral protuberances and cavities, which anfwer to as many cavi- ties and procefles of the other bone with which it is articu- lated ; as in the conjundion of the femur with the tibia. The fecond fpecies is, when a bone receives another at one end, and is received by the fame bone at the other end ; as in the radius and ulna. The laft fort is, when a bone â€™receives another, and is received by a third ; as in the oblique procefles of the ver- tebrae. When I firft mentioned the articulations of bones, I fald there were different opinions concerning the ufe of their technical names; e. g. It has been faid, that fymphyfts fliould be the name for the immoveable articulations, and fynarihrofts Ihould be underflood to be the conjundtion of bones by fome connedling medium Thofe who have taken fymphyfts in the fenfe I did, of its exprefling the con- jundlion of bones with a connedling fubflance, have dif- agreed in their definition of it; fome inferting, and others leaving out, its allowing motion. When they have agreed in their definition, they have not been of the fame mind concerning the fpecies of it: for feveral think the fyffaf* cofts and fyndefmofts applicable to fo many joints which are unlverfally (^) Artlculatio mutua, (i) Baker, Curf.

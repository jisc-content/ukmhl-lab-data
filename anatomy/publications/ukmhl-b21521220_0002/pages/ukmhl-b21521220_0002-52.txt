10 OF THE BONES four kinds* viz. the perpendicular^ oblique^ headed^ and crooked, have, been defcribed : But in bones fitly prepared, I could only fee numerous irregular procefTes rifing out from the plates (i). Though the exterior part of bones is compofed of firm compaft plates, yet they are all more or lefs cavernous Internally. In fome (e g. middle thin part of the fcapula and os ilium) the folid fides are brought fo near, that little cavity can be feen ; and in others (middle of os humeri, fe- moris, &c.) the cavities are fo large, that fuch bones arc generally efteemed to be hollow or fiftular. But the in- ternal fpongy texture is evident in young animals; and fome of it may be feen to remain in thofe of the greateft age, when bones are cautioully opened, after they have been kept fo long as to be free of the oil they contain, or after being burnt. This fpongy cavernous internal part of bones is generally called their Cancelli, or Lattice-work, and is form- ed in the following manner. The plates are firmly joined about the middle of the bone *, but as tliey are extended towards Its ^nds, the more internal parts feparate from the exterior, and ftretch out their fibres towards the axis of the bone, where they are interwoven with the fibres of other plates that have been fent off in the fame way. See- ing the plates are thus conftantly going off, the folid fides of the bones rnuft become thinner, and the lattice-w'ork mull be thicker and ftronger towards their ends. This is evident in many of them, where the folid fides of their middle are very thick, and the cancelli are fcarce obfer- vable ; whereas, at the ends, where their diameter is great- eft, the folid walls or fides are not thicker than paper, and #he cancelli are numerous, and large enough to fill up the whole fpace left between the fides.

The fternum (2), or breaft-bonc, is the broad flat bone, , or pile of bones, at the fore part of the thorax. The num- ber of bones into which this flrould be divided, has occa- fioned debates among anatomifls, who have confidered it in fubjedls of different ages. In adults of a middle age, it is compofcd of three bones, which eafily feparate after the cartilages connecting them aire deftroyed. The two low- er bones are frequently found intimately united ; and very often, in old people, the fternum is a continued bony ful> fiance from one end to the other ; though we ftill obferve two, fomelimes three, tranfverfe lines on its furface j which arc marks of the former divlfions. When we confidej- the fternum as one bone, we find it broadeft and thickefl above, and becoming fmaller as it defeends. The internal furface of this bone is fomewhat hollowed for enlarging the thorax : but the convexity on the external furface is not fo confpicuous, becaufe the fides are prefted outwards by the true ribs ; the round heads of whofe cartilages are received into feven fmooth pits formed in each fide of the fternum, and are kept firm there by ftrong ligaments, which on the external furface have a particular radiated texture (a). The cartilaginous fibres frequently thruft themfelves into the bony fubftance of the fternum, and are joined by a fort of future. Ihe pits at the upper-part of the fternum are at the greateft dif- tance (e) Ospcfloris, tnfiforme, feutum coidU. Ruyfeh, Catalog. Rar. fig. 9.

Chap. I. IN GENERAL. ii The twifting and winding which thefe cancelli make, and the interftices which they leave, differ confiderably in figure, number, and fize ; and therefore form little cells, which are as different, but communicate with each other. Some writers [i) minutely remark thefe different appear- ances of the cancelli, after they begin to feparate from the plates; and from thence diftinguifh them into â€¢wrinkled, perforated, and net-like. The cancelli fuflain the membranous bags of the mar- row which are flretched upon them, and thereby hinder thefe membranous parts from being torn, or removed out of their proper places, In the violent motions and different poftures which the bones are employed in. This fupport which the cancelli afford to the marrow, alfo faves its membranes and veffels, in the lower parts of the bones, from being compreffed by the weight of the marrow above. The deprefllons between the fibres of the external plates of bones appear like fo many furrows on their furface, into each of w'hich the periofteum enters; by which the furface of contaff, confequently the cohefion, between it and the bone, is confiderably jncreafed, and a greater num- ber of veffels is fent from it into the bone than if it was a plain furface. Both on the ridges and furrows, numerous little pits or orifices of canals are to be feen, by which the veffds pafs to and from the bones. After a fuccefsful injection, the arteries cari be traced in their courfe from the pits to the plates and fibres j and, in fawing, cutting, or rafping the bones of living creatures, thefe veffels dlfcover themfelves by the fmall drops of blood which then ooze out from the moft folid part of the bones. But the cleareft demonftration of the intimate diflribution of thefe fmall arteries, is, to obferve the effea: of fuch a 2 tinging (^) C^gliard. Anat, olfium, cap. j. obf. 4. 5. 6. 7,

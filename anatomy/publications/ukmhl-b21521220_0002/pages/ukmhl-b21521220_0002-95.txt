BONES OF THE HEAD. 53 Chap. II. mon bafe (b). On this account, we can fupport ourfelves as firm as if the axis of all the bones had been a flraight line perpendicular to the horizon; and we have much greater quickncfs, eafe, and ftrength, in feveral of the mod neceflary motions we perform. It is true, indeed, that wherever the bones, on which any part of our body is fuftained, decline from a flraight line, the force required in the mufcles to counterafl the gravity of that part is greater than Was otherwife necefliiry: But then this is ef- fe£lually provided for in fuch places, by the number and ftrength of the mufcles. So long, therefore, as we re- main in the fame pofture, a confiderable number of mufcles muft be in a conftant ftate of contradlion; which we know, both from reafon and experience, muft foon create an un- eafy fcnfation. This we call being weary of one pofure: An inconvenience that we fliould not have had in ftand- ing ereQ, if the bearing of all the bones to each other had been perpendicular; but it is more than compenfated by the advantages above mentioned. The human Ikeleton is generally divided into the Head, the Trunk;, the Superior and the Inferior Extremities. Sect. I. Of the Head. By the Head is meant all that fpheroidal part which is placed above the firft bone of the neck. It there^ fore comprehends the cranimnf and bones of the face. § I.

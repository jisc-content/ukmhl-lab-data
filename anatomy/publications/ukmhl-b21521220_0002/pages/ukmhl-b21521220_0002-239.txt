At the root of the fpine, on the back-part of the bafe, a triangular plain furface is formed by the preflure of the lower fibres of the trapezius. Be- low this the edge of the fcapula is fcabrous and rough, for the infertion of the ferratus major anticus and rhomboid mufcles. T.ie back-part of the inferior angle is made fmooth by the latillimus dorfi pafiing over it. This mufcle alfo alters the direction of the inferior cofta fome way forwards from this angle : and fo far it is flatted behind by the origin of the teres major. As the inferior cofta advances forward, it is of confiderable thicknefs, it ft flightly hollowed and made fmooth behind by the teres minor, while it has a foiTa formed into it below by part of the fubfcapularis ; and between the two a ridge with a fniall depreffien appears, where the longus extenfor cubiti has its origin. The fuperior colta is very thin : and near its fore-part there is a femilunar niche, from one end of which to the, other a ligament is ftretched ; and fometimes the bone is continued to form one, or fometimes two, holes for the paflage of the fcapular blood-veflels and nerves. Imme- diately behind this femilunar cavity the coraco-hycid mufcle has its rife From the niche to the termination of the fofla for the teres minor, the fcapula is narrower than any where elfe, and fupports the third f)rocefs. This part has the name of cervix. The whole dorfum of the fcapula is always fald to be convex ; but, by reafon of the raifed edges that furround it, it is divided into two cavities by the fpine, which is ftretched from behind forwards, much nearer to the fup- nor than to the inferior cofta. The cavity above the fpine is really concave where the fupra-fpinatus mufcle is lodged; while the furface of this bone below the fpine, on which

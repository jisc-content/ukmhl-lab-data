TO THE STUDENTS OF ^NATOMY IN THR % UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH. Gentlemen, â– ^HEN this OJleohgy was firfl prinleA in 1726, I did not know that Albinus, Wiuflow, and Palfyn, were to publiih defcriptions of the bones ; otherwife my papers probably would have remained yet undelivered to the printers. I flatter myfelf, however, that this ejfay has been of ufe to the gentlemen who did me the honour to attend my Icftures, by affifting them to under- ftand ipy fenfeand reprefcntation of things in this fundamental part of anatomy ; and that it has poffibly been of more advantage to them than a more complete work from an abler hand, unlefs my demonftrations had been in the order and method of fuch an author. This view of your improvement. Gentlemen, is a prevailing ar- gument with me to caufe this eflay to be reprinted ; and you can- not reafonably blame me, if I Hkewife acknowledge another mo- tive for it, which more particularly relates to mf felf. In a new edition an author has an opportunity of making his works more correft, complete, and confequently more acceptable to the public, who may perhaps be indulgent enough to think this little treatife nc>t altogether ufelefs ; fince more reafoning on the ftrufture and morbid phanomcna of bones is to be found in it, than in the ether writers, who have confined themfelves almoft entirely to the de* feriptive or proper anatomical part of the ojleology. I have here kept in the plan of the former editions, by firft confidtring, in the order that feerned to me moll natural and me- tho'dical, every thing which I thought neceflary to be known con- cerning bones in general ; and, in the fecond place, 1 have de- feribed the feveral bones compofing the llccleton. The bones of adults aie what 1 principally endeavour to de- feribe,; but 1 have added as much of the qfleogenea as 1 think fer- viceable in the piaftlce of phyfic and furgery. That

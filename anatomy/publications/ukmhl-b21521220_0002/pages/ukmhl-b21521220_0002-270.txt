22S - OF THE SKELETON. Parti. I rough fpongy pit is obfervable, where the ftrong ligament, commonly, but unjuftly, called the roiwd oiiCy is fixed, to be extended from thence to the lower internal part of the receiving cavity, where it is confiderably broader than near to the head of the thigh-bone The fmall part be low the head, called the cefvix, of the os femoris, has a great many large holes, into which the fibres of the ftrong liga- ment, continued from the capfular, enter, and are there- by firmly united to it j and round the root of the neck, where it rifes from the bones, a rough ridge is found, wh .re the capfular ligament of the articulation itfelf is con- nedled. Below the back-part of this root, ' the large un- equal protuberance, called trochatiier major {a), ftands out; the external convex part of which is diftinguilhed into three different furfaces : whereof the one on the fore-part is fca- brous and rough, for the infertion of the glulscus mini- mus 5 the fuperior one' is fmooth, and has the glutseus me- dius inferted into it; and the one behind is made flat and fmooth, by the tendon of the glutasus maximus^paffing over it. The upper edge of this procefs is fliarp and pointed at its back-part, where the glutaeus medius is fixed ; but for- wards it is more obtufe, and has two fuperficial pits form- ed in it : Into the fuperior of thefe the pyriformis is im- planted ; and the obturator internus and gemini are fixed into the lower one. From the hindrnoft prominent part of this great trochanter, a rough ridge runs backwards and downwards, into which the quadratus is inferted. In the deep hollow, at the internal upper fide of this ridge, the obturator externus is implanted. More internally, a co- noid procefs, called trochanter minor (b), rifes for the in- fertion of the mufculus pfoas and iliacus internus ; and the pedlineus is implanted into a rough hollow below its inter- nal • (a) rxurof, Rotator natls, malum granatum tcRiculol-um.

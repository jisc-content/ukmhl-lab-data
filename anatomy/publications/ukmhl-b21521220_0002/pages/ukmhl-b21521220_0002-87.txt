IN GENERAL. Chap- L 45 of the fame flru6lnre and ufe to them as the peilolleum is to the bones. Cartilages are compofed of plates, wliich are formed of fibres, difpofed much In the the fame way as thole of bones are; as miglit be reafonably concluded from obferving hones in a cartilaginous ftate before they oflify, and from feeing, on the other hand, fo many, cartilages become bony. This may be Hill further confirmed by the exfoliation which car- tilages are fubjett to as well as bones. The perichondrium of feveral cartilages, for Vxamj^le thofe of the ribs and larynx, has arteries, which can be equally well injetffed with thofe of tlie periofteum; but the velTcls of that membrane in other parts, e. g. the articular cartilages, are fmaller, aud in none of them does injeftion enter deep into the fubftance of the cartilages ; nay, madder, mixed with the food of animals, does not change the colour of cartilages as it does that of bones (rr)J The granulated flefli which rifes from the ends of metacar- pal or metatarfal bones, when the cartilage exfoliates, after a finger'or tde has been taken olF at the firft joint, is very fcnfible; from which the exigence of nerves in cartilages may be inferred. While cartilages are in a natural ftate, it is to be remark- ed, firft. That they fiave no cavity in their middle for mar- row. Secondly, That their outer furface is fofteft, which renders them more flexible. Thirdly, That they do not ap- pear to change their texture near fo much by acids as bones do. And, lalUy, That as tfie fpecific gravity of cartilages is near a tliird Icfs than that of bones; fo the cohefion of their feveral plates is not fo ftrong as in bones : Whence cartilages laid bare in bounds or ulcers, are net only more liable to corrupt, but exfoliate much fooncr than'bones do.

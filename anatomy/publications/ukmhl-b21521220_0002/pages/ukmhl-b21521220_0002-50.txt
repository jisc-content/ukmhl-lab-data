8 Part I. OF THE BONES The chief ufes tf the periofteum are : i. To allow the mufcles, when they coiitra<3. or are llretched, to move and Hide eafily upon the bones; the fmooth furface of this membrane preventing any ill efl'e£ls of their fridlion upon each other. 2. To^ keep in due order and to fupport the veflels in thejr paffage to the bones* 3. By being firmly braced on the bones, to 'alfift in fetting limits to their in- creafe, and to check their overgrowth. 4. To ftrengthen the conjundtion of the bones with, their epiphyfes, liga- ments, and cartilages, which are eafily feparated in young creatures, when this membrane is taken away. 5. To af- ford convenient origin and infertion to feveral mufcles which are fixed to this membrane. And laftly. To warn us when any injury is offered to the parts it covers; which being infenfible, might otherwife be deftroyed without our knowledge, or endeavouring to procure a remedy. When the cellular fubftance conriefting the periofteum to the furrounding parts is deftroyed, thefe parts are ,fixed to that membrane, and lofe the Hiding motion they had upon it ; as we fee daily in iffues, or any other tedious fup- purations near a bone.-' When the veffcls which go from the periofteum to the bones arc broken or eroded, a col- leftion of liquor is made between them, which produces a fordid ulcer or rotten bone. Tbis often is the cafe after fra£lures of bones and inflammations of the periofteum, or after fmall pox, meafles, fpotted feVers, and eryfipelas. Do not the diforders of the periofteum, coming rather along with or foon after the cutaneous than other difeafes5 indicate fome fimilarity of ftrufture in the periofteum and fkin ? OF THE COblPO^ITION OF BONES. The bones are the moft hard and folid parts of the bo- dy ; and like all other parts where large veflels do not en- ter,

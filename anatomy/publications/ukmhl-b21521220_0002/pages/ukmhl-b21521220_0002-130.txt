The occipital bone is joined above to the ofla parietalia, and to the triquetra, when prefent, by the lambdoid future; —laterally to the temporal' bones, by the additamenta of the lambdoid future—below to the fphenoid bone, by the end of its cuneiform procefs, in the fame way that epiphy- fes and their bones are joined : For in children a ligamen- tous cartilage is interpofed between the occipital and fphe- noid bones, which gradually turns thinner as each of the bones advances, till their fibres at lafl: run into each other; and, about fixteen or eighteen years of age, the union of thefe two bones becomes fo intimate, that a feparation can- not be made v/ithout violence.—The os occipitis is joined by a double articulation to the Crft vertebra of the neck, e.lch condyle being received into a fuperior oblique procefs of that vertebra. What motion is allowed here we fliall confider afterwards, where the vertebrae are deferibed.. The ufes of this bone appear from the preceding defciip- tion, and therefore need not be repeated. An infant, born at the full time, has this bone divided, by unofiified cartilages, into four parts.—The firft of thefe is larger than the other three, is of a triangular fliape, and conftitutes all the part of the bone above the great fora- men. Fiflures generally appear in the upper part and Tides of this triangular bone, when all the cartilage is feparated by maceration ; and fometimes little dillin£f bones are feen towards the edges of it —The fecond and third pieces of this bone are exa£fly alike, and fituated on each fide of the great foramen, from wirich the whole condyles are nearly produced; and they are extended forwards almoft to the fore part of the hole for the ninth pair of nerves.— The fourth piece is the cuneiform procefs, which forms a fmall fliare of the great hole, and of thofe for the ninth pair

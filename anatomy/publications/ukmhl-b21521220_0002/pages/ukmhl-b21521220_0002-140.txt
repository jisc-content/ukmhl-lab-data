Part I. OF THE SKELETON. I protuberance of the internal plate of the pterygoid procefs, and by the point of the procefi'us petrofus of the temporal bone. Its canal is extended above the inner plate of the \ pterygoid procefs ; and where it opens into the cavity of the nofe, it is concealed by the thin laminous part of palate-bone. Through it a confiderable branch of the fe- cond branch of the fifth pair of nerves is refleifled.—In the middle of the fella turcica, a fmall hole or two often pierce as far as the cellular fubftance of the bone ; and fometlmes at the Tides of this fella, one or more fmall holes, penetrate into the fphenoidal finufes. Thefe obfervations afforded fome anatomifts (^) an argument of weight in their days in defence of Galen (/a), who aflertcd the defcent of the pituita that way into the finufes below. , Tire firft of the common holes is that unequal fiffure at the fide of the fella turcica, between the extreme point of the os petrofum and the fpinous procefs of the cuneiform bone. This hole only appears after the bones are boiled ; for in a recent fubjciSl its back-part is covered by a thin bony plate that lies over the internal carotid artery, and farther forward it is filled wdth a cartilaginous ligament, under which the cartilaginous part of the Euftachian tube is placed: It was by this paffage that the antients believed the flimy matter M'as conveyed from the emunclory of the brain, the glandula pituitaria, to the fauces. The fe- cond common hole is the large difeontinuation of the ex- ternal fide of the orbit, left between the orbitar pnocelfes of the cuneiform bone, the os maxillare, malse, and pa- lati. In this large hole the fat for lubricating the globe of the eye and temporal mufcles is lodged, and branches of the fuperior maxillary nerve, with fmall arteries from the carotid, \ (£) Joe. Syl.

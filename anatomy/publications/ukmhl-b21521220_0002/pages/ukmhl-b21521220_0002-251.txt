Chap. II. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. aep / The ulna is articulated abave with the lower end of the os humeri, where thefe bones have depreflions and protu- berances correfponding to each other, fo as to allow an eafy and fecure extenfion of the fore-arm to almoft a Itraight line with the aririj and flexion to a very acute an- gle ; but, by the flanting pofition of the pulley, the lower part of the fore-arm is turned outwards in the extenfion, and inw'ards in the flexion (r) } and a ver^fmall kind of rotation is likewife allowed in all pofitions, efpecially when the ligaments are mofl relaxed by the fore arm being in a middle degree of flexion. The ulna is alfo articulated with the radius dud carpus, in a manner to be related af- terwards. RADIUS. Radius {t), fo called from its Imagined rcfemblance to a fpoke of a wheel or to a weaver’s beam, is the bone placed at the infide of the fore-arm. Its upper end is formed into a circular little head, which is hollowed for an articulation with the tubercle at the fide of the pulley of the os hume- ri ; and the half of the round circumference of the head next to the ulna is fmooth, and covered with a cartilage, in order to be received into the femilunated cavity of that bone. Below the head, the radius is much fmaller; therefore this part, w'hich is made round by the adlion of the fupinator radii brevis, is named its cervix At the external root of this neck, a tuberous 'procefs rifes ; into the outer part of w'hich the biceps flexor cubiti is in- fcrted. From this a ridge runs downwards and inwards, where the fupinator radii brevis is inferted ; and a little be- low, and behind this ridge, there is a rough fcabrous furface, where the pronator radii teres is fixed. The body of the radius is not ftraight, but convex on VoL. I. D d (i) Winflow, Mcmoiies de I’acad. dcs fciences, 1722. (/) Ktfxif, n-ajiccTTn^iov, Tocile minus, canna njinvr, arundo minor.

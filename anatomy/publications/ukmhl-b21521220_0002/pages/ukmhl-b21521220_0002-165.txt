Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. 123 terminate in an oblong fmooth head, fupported by a cer- vix. The heads, whofe greatefl; length is tranfvcrfe, and whofe convexity is turned forwards, are tipped with a car- tilage, as the articulated parts of all other moveable bones are. The fore-part of the root and neck of thefe condy- loid procefles are a little hollow and rough where the ex- ternal pteregoid mufcles are infertcd. The holes of the lower jaw are two on each fide ; one at the root of the procefles internally, where a large branch of the third branch of the fifth pair of nerves enters with an artery, and a vein returns. A fmall fliarp procefs fre- quently juts out backwards from the edge at the fore-part of this bole, to which a ligament extended from the tem- poral bone is fixed [t) which favCs the nerve and veflels from being too much preflTcd by the pterygoid mufcles.— From the lower fide of this hole, either a fmall fuperficial canal or furrow defcends, where a branch of the nerve is lodged, in its way to the mylo-hyoideus inufc^ and fub- lingual gland {«). The other hole is external, at the con- fines of the chin, where branches of the nerve and veflels come out. The canal between thefe two holes is formed in fhe middle of the fubftance of the bone, and is pierced by a great number of fmall holes, by which the nerves and blood-veflels of the cancelli and teeth pafs. This canal is continued a little farther than the external hole at the chin, —On account of the veflbls and nerves in the lower jaw, fra£l;ures of it may be attended with dangerous fymptoms. The ftirface of the lower jaw is hard and firm, except at the fpongy fockets, where, however, it is ftrongcr than the upper jaw. Its internal [ubjlance is cellular, without any folid partition between the cancelli in its middle. At the bafe, efpecially of the chin, where t^iis bone is moH 2 expofcfj (t) We'itbrecht.

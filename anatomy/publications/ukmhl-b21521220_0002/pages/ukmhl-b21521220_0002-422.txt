380 Part II. SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. becomes fborter and broader in its adlion. But this con- tradUon of its length is various; in fome more, in others Icfs; and is very confiderable in foine of the fphincters, infomuch that they appear to be contradled more than one third of their extent. The inteftines are exceedingly tenacious of their vis in- fita, as they continue to contradl themfelves long after they are taken out of the body, and even after they are cold ; and the heart is even more tenacious of this principle than the inteftines, as is evident in a young chicken, and in cold animals. Different mufcles are beft excited into adlion by different ftimuli; as the bladder by urine, the heart by the blood, and the inteftines by air. Though the nerves are removed, or the connedfion, made by them between the mufcles and the brain, cut off, the mufcles lofe but little of their irritable nature. It appears alfo from the example of polypi and other infeefs, that the fame irritable difpofi- tion extends very widely through the animal fibres. In many of thefe creatures, neither brain nor nerves can be traced, yet they are exceedingly affedted by ftimulus. Laft- ly, we perceive this vis infita in vegetables, many of which expand and contradt their flowers and leaves according to the different ftates of the atmofphere; and fome plants exert fudden and violent motions from ftimuli externally applied, appearing little inferior in this refpcdl to animals. This vis infita does not depend upon weight, attradlion, or elafticity ; for it is feated in a foft fibre, and vanifhes as the fibre grows hard. That the caufe of motion is conveyed through the nerves into the mufcles, is certain from the experiments made on the brain and nerves. For the nerve alone has feeling ; this alone carries the commands of the foul; and of thefe commands there is neither intimation nor perception in that part, whole uerve is either tied or cut, or which has no_ nerve.

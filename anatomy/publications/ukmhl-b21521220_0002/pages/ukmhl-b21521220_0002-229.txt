The fubjlaiice of the breall bone is cellular, wiph a very tliin external plate, efpecially on its internal furface, where we may frequently obferve a cartilaginous cruft fpread over it {b).—On both furfaces, however, a ftrong ligamentous membrane is clofely braced ; and the cells of this bone are fo fm:dl, that a coiifiderable quantity of ofleous fibres muft be employed in the compofition of it. Whence, with the defence which the mufclesgive it, and the moveable fupport it has from the cartilages, it is fulficiently fecured from being broken : for it is ftrong by its quantity of bone, its parts are kept together by ligaments ; and it yields enough to elude conGderably any violence offered (r). So far may be faid of this bone in general; but the three bones, of which, according to the common account, it is compofed in adults, arg each to be examined. The firjly all agree, is fomewhat of the figure pf a heart, as it is commonly painted ; only it does not terminate in a fliarp point This is the itppermoft thickeft part of the fternum. i The upper middle part of this firft bone, where it is thickeft, is hollowed, to ittake place for the trachea arte- ria , though this cavity [d) is principally formed by the • bone being raifed on each fide of it, partly by the clavicles thrufting it inwards, and partly by the fterno-maftoidei mufcles pulling it upwards. On the outfide of each tu- bercle there is an oblong cavity, that, in viewing it tranf- verfely from before backwards, appears a little convex Into thefe glenae, the ends of the clavicle are received.— Immediately below thefe, the fides of this bone begin to A a 2 tun; (i) Jac.

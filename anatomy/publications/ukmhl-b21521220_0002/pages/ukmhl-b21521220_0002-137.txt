Chap. II. BONES OF THE HEAD. 9J I From it joins the nafal plate of the os ethmoides, is thin and ftraight. Thefe two parts have been defcribed as* two di- ftindl procefies by fome writers. The depreffions, finuofities, and foflx, on the external furface of this fphenoid bone, may be reckoned up to a great number, viz. Two on the temporal apophyfes, where the crotaphite mufcles lodge—Two on the orbitar procef- fes, to make way for the globes of the eyes Two be- tween the temporal and fpinous procefles, for receiving the temporal bones Two between the plates of the pte- rygoid procefles, where the mufculi pterygoidei interni and ptery-ftaphylini interni are placed—Two between the pterygoid and orbitar procefles, for forming the holes common to this and to the cheek and maxillary bones—■ Two on the lower ends of the allform procefles, which the palate bones enter into Two at the roots of the tem- poral and pterygoid procefles, where the largeft (hare of the external pterygoid mufcles have their rife—Two at the fides of the proceflTus azygos, for forming part of the nofe, &c. What I defcribed under the name of temporal and fpinous procejfes on the outfide of the flcull, are likewlfe feen on its inflde, where they are concave, for receiving part of the brain; and commonly three apophyfes on the internal fur- face of the fphenoid bone are only mentioned. Two rlfing broad from the fore-part of its body, become fmaller as they are extended obliquely backwards. The third Hand- ing on a long tranfverfe bafe, near the back part of the bo- dy of this bone, rifes nearly ereft, and of an equal breadth, terminating often in a little knob on each fide. The three are called clinoid, from fome refemblance which they were thought to have to the fupporters of a bed. Sometimes one or both the anterior cllnoid procefTes are joined to the Cdes of the poftcrior one, or the body of the bone Itfelf. '•

Chap. II. SUPERIOR EXTREMITIES. 225 The motion of this third bone is confined to flexion and extenfion. The orderly dlfpofitlon of the bones of the fingers in- to three rows, has made them generally obtain the name of three phalanges (n). All of them have half-round convex furfaces, covered with an aponeurofis, formed by tlie tendons of the extenfors, lumbricales, and interofTei, and placed directly backwards, for their greater flrength j and their flat concave part is forwards, for taking hold more furely, and for lodging the tendons of the flexor mufcles.—— The ligaments for keeping down thefe'tendons are fixed to the angles that are between the convex and concave fides. The bones of the firfl; phalanx (0) of the fingers anfwer to the defeription of the fecond bone of the thumb; only that the cavity in their bafe is not fo oblong ; nor is their motion on the metacarpal bone/ fo much confined : For they can be moved laterally or circularly ; but have no rota- tion, or a very fmall degree of it, round their axis. Both the ends of this firll phalanx are in a cartilaginous ■ftate at the birth ; and the upper one is afterwards afiixed in form of an epiphyfe. The fecond bone (/») of the fingers has its bafe formed into two lateral caviti<?s, and a middle protuberance ; while the lower end has two lateral protuberances and a middle cavity ; therefore it is joined at both ends in the fame mannetj which none of the bones of the thumb are. This bone is in the fame condition with the former in children. ' •» The third bone (<7) differs nothing from the defeription of the third bone of the thumb, excepting in the general VoL. I.

Part II. 382 SYSTEM OF ANATOMY. wrinkles: the whole mufcle alfo becomes fliorter, and draws its extremities towards the middle j hence it draws to- wards each ocher thofe parts with which it was connected : the mufcle alfo fwells by its contraction, becoming hard at tlie fame time, and as it were increafes its circumference on every fide. Haller has never obferved it to turn pale. Whether on the whole it is increafed in bulk, or acquires more in breadth than it lofes in length, is dilhcult to be known. It draws after it the tendons, which are obfe- quious to its motions, though of themfelves neither move- able nor irritable. The whole mufcle is alfo capable of be- ing moved at once, or only a' part of it; if one extremity }g fixed to an immoveable part, that only is moved which is capable of yielding. « If it be demanded, Whether the arteries conduce any thing to mufcular motion ? and whether the palfy of the lower limbs after a ligature upon the aorta, be not an ar- gument of this opinion ? w^e anfwer, No farther than as they conduce to the found ftate of the mufcle, or to the confervation of the mutual fbruffure and habit of the parts, which they fupply with vapour, fat, &c.: for the irritation of an artery does not affedl or convulfe the mufcle to which it belongs; nor does a ligature on it caufe a palfy, unlefs after a confiderable time, when the mufcles begin to be de- llroyed by a gangrene. Moreover, it is impracticable to explain the motion of peculiar mufcles from a caufe deri- ved with an equal force from the heart to all parts of the body. Laitly the influence of the will is confined to the nerves, without reliding in the arteries or other folid parts of the body. but the dire£t manner by which the nerves excite motion in the mufcles, is fo obfeure, that we may almofl; for ever defpair of its difcovcry. ! he opinion, that the nervous veficlcs fwell by a quicker flux of the nervous fpirits, is in- ^ conlillent

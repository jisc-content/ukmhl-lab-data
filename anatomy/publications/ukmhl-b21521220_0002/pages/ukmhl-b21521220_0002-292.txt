OF THE SKELETON. Parti 150 neiforme behind, where it is joined to the os naviculare, is hollow, fmooth, and of a circular figure below, but pointed above. The external fide confifts of two fmooth and flat furfaces, whofe dire£lion is nearly at right angles with each other. With the poflerior, that runs obliquely from below forwards and upwards, the os cuneiforme mi- nimum is joined ; and with the anterior, whofe dire£lion is longitudinal, ' the os metatarfi of the toe next to the great one is connefted. The fore-part of this bone is femi- lunar, but flat and fmooth, for fuftaining the os metatarfi of the great toe. The internal fide is fcabrous, with two re- markable tubercles below, from which the mufculus abduc- tor poUicis rifes, and the tibialis anticus is inferted into its upper part. The three cuneiform bones are all fo fecured by ligaments, that very little motion is allowed in any of them, and they are cartilaginous in a fcetus of nine months. The feven bones of the tarfus^ when joined, are con- vex above, and leave a concavity below, for lodging fafely the feverul mufcles, tendons, velTels, and nerves, that lie in the foie of the foot. In the recent fubjed, their upper and lower furfaces are covered with llrong ligaments, which adhere firmly to them ; and all the bones are fo tightly conne£led by thefe and the other ligaments, which are fix- ed to the rough ridges and foflie mentioned in the proceed- ing defcription of the particular bones, that notwithfland- ing the many furfaces covered with cartilage, fome of which are of the form of the very moveable articulations, no more motion is here' allowed, than only to prevent too great a fhock of the fabric of the body in walking, leap- ing, &c. by falling on too folid a bafe ; which, if it was one continued bone, would likewife be much more liable to be broken ; and, in order to make our foot accommo- date itfelf to the furfaces we tread on, by becoming more or

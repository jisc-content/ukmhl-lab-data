155 Chap. II. BONES OF THE TRUNK. U 2 The The conne£llon of the dorfal rertebrte to the ribs, the thinnefs of their cartilages, the ere£l fituation of the oblique procefles, the length, hoping, and connection of the fpinal procefles, all contribute to reftrain thefe vertebrte from much motion, which might difturb the aCtions of the heart and lungs ; and in confequence of the little motion allowed here, the intervertebral cartilages fooner flirivel, by becoming more folid ; and therefore the firfl; remarkable curvature of the fplne obferved, as people advance to old age, is in the leaft ftretched vertebrae of the back ; or old people firll be- come round fliouldcred. The bodies of the four uppermoft dorfal vertebrae deviate from the rule of the vertebrae becoming larger as they defeend : for the firfl; of the four is the largeft, and the other three below gradually become fmaller, to allow the trachea and large velTels to divide at fmaller angles. The two uppermofl. vertebrte of the back, inftead of being very prominent forwards, are flatted by the aClion of the muf- culi longi colli and reCli majores. The proportional fize of the two little deprefiions in the body of each vertebra for receiving the heads of the ribs, feems to vary in the following manner ; the deprelfion.ou the upper edge of each vertebra decreafes as far down as the fourth, and after that increafes. The tranfverfe procefles are longer in each lower verte- bra to the feventh or eighth,' with their fmooth furfaces, for the tubercles of the ribs, facing gradually more down- wards ; but afterwards, as they defeend, they become fliort- er, and the fmooth furfaces are direCled more up- wards. The fpinous procefTes of the vertebra; of the back become ! gradually longer and more flanting, from the firfl; as far down as the eighth or ninth vertebra i from which they manifellly turn fhorter and more ereCt.

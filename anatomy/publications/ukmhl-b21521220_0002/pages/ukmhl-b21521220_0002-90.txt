OF THE BONES' Part'I. 48 OF THE S Y N O V I A. The liquor wliich principally ferves to moillen the liga- ments and cartilages of the articulations is fupplicd by glands, which are commonly fituated in the joint, after ^ fuch a manner as to be gently prefled, but not deftroyed by its motion. By thi.l means, when there is the greateft ne- | ceflity for this liquor, that is, when the mod frequent mo- | tions -ar? performed, the greated quantity of it mud be ii feparated. Thefe glands are foft and pappy, but not fri- i able: in fome of the large joints they are of the conglo* ij merate kind, or a great number of fmall glandules are ii wrapt up in one common membrane. Their excretory k du6ls are long, and hang loofe, like fo many fringes, w’ith- in the articulation ; which, by its motion and prefTure, pre- tj vents obdruftions in the body of the gland or its excreto- <j ties, and promotes the return of this liquor, when fit to be ■ take;i up by the abforbent veflTcls, which mud be in the b joints, as well as in the other cavities in the body; and, at the fame time, the prelTure on the excretory dutds hinders a t fupeyfluous unnec«fl'ary fecretion, while the fimbriated dif-d pofifion of thefe excretories does not allow any of the fe-1 creted liquor to be puflied back again by thefe canals to-J wards the glands (r). Very often thefe fountains cf flimy liquor appear onlyji as a net-work of veflels.—Frequently they are almod con-o ccaled by cellul.ir membranes containing the fat—and fome-a limes fmall fimple mucous folliculi may be ften (^). The different joints have thefe organs in different num-J bers and fizes : the conglomerate ones do nor vary much,: efpecially as to fituation, in the fimilar joints of different f bodies; but the others are more uncertain.

lio OF THE SKELE,TON. Part i. for the fame number of teeth is not In all people, and the four farthcft teeth of each fide in each jaw vary greatly in their number of roots; and when the teeth 'of a living perfon fall out or are taken away, the fockets fill up with an cfleous net work, which becomes folid afterwards. 6. The lacrymal folia in the nafal procefs, which aflifts the os unguis to form a paflage for the lacrymal duft. The part of the bone forming this fofla is fo firm and ftrong, that a furgeon can fcarcely perforate it with the ordinary inftru- ments for the fiftula lacrymalis j and therefore ought to a- void it in doing this operation. Immediately on the out- fide of this, there is a finall deprefiion, from which the in- > ferior or lefler oblique mufcle of the eye has its origin (z). 7. The canal on the upper part of the great tuberofity within the orbit, which is almoft a complete hole •, in this a branch of the fuperior maxillary nerve pafles. Befides thefe, the fuperior furface of the great bulge is concave, to receive the under part of the eye. Immediately above the tranfverfe ridge in the nafal procefs, a fmall hollow is formed by the os fpongiofum. In fome fubje£ls, the nkfal procefs has a fmall round pit above the lacrymal du£I, where the little tendon or ligament of the orbicular mufcle of the: eye lids is inferted. It is this tendon, and not the tendon of the larger oblique mufcle of the eye, which there is fome hazard of cutting in the operation of the fiilula lacry- malis. ' The hdes of this bone are two proper and two common, which are always to be found j befides feveral others, whofe magnitude, number, &c. are uncertain. The firlt of the proper is the external orbitar, immediately belov^ the orbit, by w'hich the infra-orbitar branch of the fecond branch of the fifth pair of nerves, and a fmall artery, come out, after having pafled in the canal, at the botton'i / of (as) Winflow, Expofition anatomique des os fees. § 276.

II. fpinous pTocefs of the fphenoid bone, behind the entry of the artery of the dura mater ; then runs backwards, and a little upwards, along with the nerve called chorda tympdm, in a filTure of the os temporis near the foffa that lodges the condyle of the lower jaw. Inferted into the long procefs of the malleus, within the tympanum, where it refts upon the edge of the fiflure be- tween the pars fquamofa and petrofa. Ufe, To draw the malleus obliquely forwards towards its origin, and confequently the membrana tympani; by which means that membrane is made lefs concave, or is relaxed. Externus mallei, Albinus. Anterior mallei, Winllow, Obliquus auris, Douglas. 2. Tensor Tympani, Arifcs by a very fmall beginning, from the cartilagi- nous extremity of the Euftachian tube, juft where it be- gins to be covered by the pars petrofa, and fpinous procefs of the fphenoid bone, near the entry of the artery of the dura mater; from thence running backwards near the of- feous part of the Euftachian tube, it forms a very diftinÂ£l flefliy belly, below a thin ofleous plate, between the pars fquamofa and labyrinth ; and fends off a flender tendon, M'hich makes a turn into the tympanum along with the nerve called chorda tympani, Inferted into the pofterior part of the handle of the mal- leus, a little lower than the root of its long procefs. Ufe. To pull the malleus and membrana tympani inwards towards the pars petrofa, by which the membrane is made more concave and tenfe. internus mallei, Winfiow. Internus auris, Douglas. 3. Stapedius, Arifes, by a fmall fldhy belly, from a little cavern in the

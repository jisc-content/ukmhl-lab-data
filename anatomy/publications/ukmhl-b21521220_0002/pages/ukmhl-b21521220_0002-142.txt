Part t OF THE SKELETON. 100 bonnes above, to the os frontls and ofla malarum before, to the temporal bones behindby the fore-part of its body and fpinous proceffes, to the frontal and ethmoid bones; by its back-part, behind the two finufes, to the occipital, where it looks like a bone with the epiphyfes taken off, and, as was formerly obferved in the defcrip- tion of the occipital bone, it cannot be feparated without violence in adults; to the palate-bones, by the ends of the pterygoid procefs, and ftiil more by the fore-part of the internal plates of the pterygoid^i^ocefles, and of the finufes;—to the maxillary bones,- bAthe fore-part of the external pterygoid plates;—to the vomer and nafal plate of the os ethmoides, by the proceltus azygos. All thefe conjun£lions, except the laft, which is a fchindylefis, are faid to be by the future proper to this bone ; though it Is at firft fight evident, that feveral other futures, as the .1 tranfverfe, ethmoidal, &c. are confounded with it. We fee now how this bone is joined to all the bones of the cranium, and to mofi; of the upper jaw; and therefore obtained the name of the nvedgf-like bone. The ufes are fo blended with the defeription, as to leave nothing new to be added concerning them. The fphenoidal bone is almoft complete in a foetus of nine months^: only the great alas feparate after maceration from the body of the bone.—The procefTus azygos is very large and hollow ; the thin triangular procell'es are not oflified; the internal furface of the body is unequal and porous; the fiuufes do not appear. Whoever is acquainted with each bone of the cranium, can, without dilEculty, examine them as they Hand united, fo as to know the fliapes, fizes, diftances, &c. of their fe- veral parts, and the forms, capacities, &c. of the cavities formed by them ; which is of great ufe towards under- ftanding the anatomy of the parts contiguous to, contain- ed

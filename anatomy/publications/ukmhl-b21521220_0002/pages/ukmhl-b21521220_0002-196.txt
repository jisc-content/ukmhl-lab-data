OF THE SKELETON. Part I. *54 The the other large veffels to run fecurc from the a£lion of the vital organs. Their bodies are more concave behind than any of the other two clafles.—Their upper and lower furfaces are horizontal. The cartilages interpofed between the bodies of thefe vcr- tebrre are thinner than in any other of the true vertebra:; and contribute to the concavity of the fpine in the thorax, by being thinnefl at their fore-part. The oblique procefles are placed almoll perpendicularly; the upper ones flanting but a little forwards, and the lower ones flanting as much backwards. Their convexity or concavity is not fo remarkable as to require particular no- tice. Between the oblique procefits of oppofite fides, feve- ral fliarp procefles ftand out from the upper and lower parts of the plates which join to form the fpinal procefles; into thefe fltarp procefles, (Ircng ligaments are fixed for connedling the vertebrae. The tranfverfe procefles of the dorfal vertebrae are long, thicker at their ends than in the middle, and turned oblique- ly backwards ; which may be owing to the preflure of the ribs, the tubercles of which are inferted into a deprefllon near the end of thefe procefles. The fpinal procefles are long, fmall-pointed, and flo- plng downwards and backwards: from their upper and back-part a ridge rifes, which is received by a fmall chan- nel in the fore-part of the fpinal procefs Immediately above, which is here connected to it by a ligament. The conduit of the fpinal marrow^ is here more circular, but, correfponding to the fize of that cord, is fmaller than In anjr of the other vertebra;; and a larger fltare of the holes in the bony bridges, for the tranfmiflaon of the nerves, is formed in the vetebra above than in the one % below.

130 OF THE SKELETON. Part L on them, ncceflarily come out broad, and fit to make that clofe guard to the mouth (jT) which they now form. The teeth are joined to the fockets by goinploofis, and tlie gums contribute to fix them there; as is evident by the teeth falling out when the gums are any way deftroyed or made too fpongy, as in the fcurvy or falivation: whence fome authors [g) clafs this articulation with the/yffarcofts. The ufes of th-e teeth are to malVicate our aliment, and to alfifl us in the pronunciation of fevtral letters. 'Though the teeth fo far agree in their ftru£lure, yet, be- caufe of fome things wherein they dilFer, they are gene- rally divid^ into three ciafl'es, viz. inciforcs, canini, and molares^' / The Incisores [h] are "the four fore-teeth in each jaw, receiving their name from their office of cutting our ali- ment ; for whicli they are excellently adapted, being each formed into a -Iharp-cutting edge- at their bafe,«by their fore-fide turning inwards there, while they are floped down and hollowed behind (i); fo that they have the form of wedges, aijd therefore their power of affmg mufh be con- fiderably increafed.——Seeing, in the adlion of the incifo- res, a perpendicular compreffion is only neceffary, witliout any lateral motion, they are not fo firmly fixed in their fockets as the other teeth are, each having only one Ihort root; but that is broader from before backwards, than to either fide, to have the greatefl fhrengtli where it is expo- fed to the I'lrongeft force applied to it \k). The incifores of the upper jaw, efpecially the two middle ones (/), are generally broader and longer than thofe of the under jaw.

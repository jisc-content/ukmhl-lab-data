OF THE SKELETON. Part I. 166 wards Is much confined : yet, 2(s its ligaments can be ftretch- ed by a confiderable force, it is of great advantage in the excretion of the faeces alvinse, and much more in child- bearing, tliat this bone fhould remain moveable; and the right management of it, in delivering women, may be of great benefit to them (y). The mobility of the os coccy- gis diminifiiing as people advance in age, efpecially when its ligaments and cartilages have not been kept flexible by being ftretched, is probably one reafon why the women, who are old maids before they marry, have generally diffi- cult parturition. The os coccygis ferves to fuftain the inteftinum re£lum ; and, in order to perform this office more effedlually, it is made to turn with a curve forwards; by which alfo tike bone itfelf, as well as the mufcles and teguments, is pre- ferved from any injury w'hen we fit with our body reclined back. § 2. 0/ the Pelvis. The fecond part of the trunk of the flceleton, vizi the pelvis, is the cylindrical cavity at the lower part of the ab- domen formed by the os faefum, os coccygis, and ofla in- iiominata ; \f'hich lafl therefore fall now in courfe to be ex- amined.

Part I. OF THE SKELETON. 120 "bone. The nilddle cartilage of the nofe fills up what re- mains of the fofla at its fore-part. The pofttrior edge of the vomer, which appears above the back-part of the pa- late-bones, is broader above; but as it defeends forwards, becomes thinner, though it is ftlll Lolid and firm. The lower edge of this b.)ne, which reds on the nafal fpine of the palate and maxillary bones, has a little furrow on each fide of a fmall middle ridge, anfwering to the fpines of the bones of dillcrent Tides, and the interftices between them. This and the upper edge meet in the pointed fore end of this bone. The body of the vomer has a fmooth and folid furface, but thin fubftance ; and towards its fides, where it is thic- kefi:, fomc cancelli may be obferved when the bone is bro- ken. It is joined above to the fphenoid and ethmoid bones, and to the middle cartilage of the nofe by fchindyleGs: below, to the maxillary and palate bones by the fpinous future. . The vomer divides the noftrils ; enlarges the organ of fmelling, by allowing place for expanding the membrane of the nofe on its Odes ; and fuftains the palate-plates of the maxillary and palate-bones, which otherwife might be in hazard of being prelTed into the noftrils : while the vomer is fecured from fhuffling to one fide or other by the double fchindylefis, by which it is joined to the bones above and below. Thus we have now defcrlbed all the bones which com- pofe the upper jaw, except the teeth, which are fo much like thofe of the lower jaw, that I choofe to make one de- feription ferve for both, in which their differences fliall be remarked, after the fecond part of the face, (i. e.) the lower jaw, is examined j becaufe the ftrudure of the teeth

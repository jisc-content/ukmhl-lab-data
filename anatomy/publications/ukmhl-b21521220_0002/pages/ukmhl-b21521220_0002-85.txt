Authors generally fay that ligaments are infenfible; and^ ponfequently it may be inferred, that they have no nerves bellowed on them. But the violent racking pain felt on the leaft motion of a joint labouring under a rheumatifm, the feat of which difeafe fecms often to be in the ligaments, and the infufferable torture occafioned by incifions’of liga- ments, and by a colledlion of acrid matter lin a joint, or by tophi in the gout, would perfuade us that they are a- bundantly fupplicd with nerves. i; ' .

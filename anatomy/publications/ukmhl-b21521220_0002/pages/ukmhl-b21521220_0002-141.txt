99 BONES OF THE HEAD. Cliap. II. carotid, and veins, pafs. The third hole is formed be- tween the bafe of this bone and the root of the orbitar procefs of the palate-bone of each fide. Throui^h this a branch of the external carotid artery, and of the fecond branch of the fifth pair of nerves, are allowed a paflage to the noftrils, and a returning vein accompanies them. Some- times, however, this hole is proper to the palate-bone, being entirely formed out of its fubftance. i Hnder the fella turcica, and fome way farther forwardj but within the fubftance of the fphenoid bone, are two JitwfeSy feparated by a bony plate." Each of them is lined with a membrane, and opens into the upper and back part of each noftril by a round hole, which is at their upper fore-part. This hole is not formed only by tke os fphe- noides, which has an aperture near as large as any tianf- Verfe fe£Iion of the fmus, but alfo by the palate-bones, which are applied to the fore part of thefe finufes, and clofe them up, that hole only excepted which was already mentioned. The two finufes are frequently of unequal dimenfions, and fometimes there is only one large cavity, with an opening into one noftril. Thefe cavities are like- wife laid (i) to be extended fometimes as far back as the .great foramen of the occipital bone. In other fubjedfs . they are not to be found, when the bone is compofed of large cells (^). Some (/) mention a cavity within the' par- tition of the finufes ; but it is fmall. The fphenoidal finufes ferve the fame ufes as the frontal. As this bone is extremely ragged and unequal, fo its fub- ftance is of very different thicknefs, being in fome places diaphanous ; in others it is a middle thicknefs, and its rriid- d!e back part furpafles the greateft flrare of the cranium in thicknefs.

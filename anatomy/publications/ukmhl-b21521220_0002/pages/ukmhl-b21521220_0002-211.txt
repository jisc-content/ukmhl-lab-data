BONES OF TH^: TRUNK. Chap. II. 169 ridge, the gluticus minimus has its origin On the out- fide of the pofterior fpinal proceffes, the dorfum of the os ilium is flat and rough, where part of the mufculus glutfc- us m.iximus and pyriformis rlfcS. The lowefl; part of this bone is the thickeft, and is formed into a large cavity with high brims, to aflifl; in c'ompofing the great acetabulum ; which fliall be cdnfidered, after all the three bones that con- ftitute the os innominatiim are defcribed. The internal furface of the os ilium is concave in its broadefl; fore-part, where the internal iliac mufcle has its origin, and where fome fliare of the inteftimim ilium and co- lon is lodged. From this large hollow, a fmall finuofity is continued obliquely forwards, at the infide of the anterior inferior fpinal procefs, where part of the pfoas and iliacus mufcles, with the crural veflels and nerves, pafs.—The large concavity is bounded below by a fliarp ridge, which runs from behind forwards; and, being continued with fuch an- other ridge of the os pubis^ forms a line of partition between the abdomen and pelvis. Into this ridge the broad tendon I of the pfoas parvus is inferred. ' All the infernal furface of the 6s ilium, behind this ridge, is very unequal: For the upper part is flat, but fpon^y, where the facro-lumbalis and longiflimus dorfi- rife. Lov/sr down, there^ is a tranfveffe ridge from which ligaments go out to the os facrum. — Immediately below this ridge, the rough unequal cavities and promi- nences are placed, which arc exadlly adapted to thofe de- fcribed on the fide of the os facrum. In the fame man- ner, the upper part of this rough furface is porous, for the firmer adhefion of the ligamentous cellular fubftance; while the lower part is more folid, and covered with a thin cartilaginous fldn, for its immoveable articulation with the os facrum. From all the circumference of this large unequal furface, ligaments are extended to the os VoL. 1. Y facrum,

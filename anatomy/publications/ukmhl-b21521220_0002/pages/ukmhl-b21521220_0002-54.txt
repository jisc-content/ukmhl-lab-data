Part r. i2 OF THE BONES tinging fubftance as can retain its colour, uhen fvvallowed, digefted, and mixed with the blood of any living animal, and at the fame time has particles fmall enough to be con- veyed into the veflels of the bones; fuch is rubia tinc- torum, madder-root (/); For we fee the gradual advances which this tindure makes from the periofteum into the more internal parts of the bones, and how univerfilly the diftribution of the liquors is made, the whole bony fub- flance being tinged by it. Whether the time in which this tinged liquor pafles from the outer to the internal plates, till all the plates are made of its colour, and the time which the dlfappearing of the dye, after giving the creature no more of this fort of food, makes us think it takes to re- turn, are the fame in which the natural liquors circulate, i(t uncertain ; becaufe this tinging fubftance may move more ' flowly, or may pafs more quickly than the natural liquors do. The arteries are larger, near each end than at the middle of the large bones that are much moved; becaufe they not « only ferve the bony plates near the ends, but pafs through them to the marrow. As animals advance in age, the arteries of the bones become lefs capacious; as is evident, I. From the bones of adults having lefs blood in them than thofe of children have. 2. From many of them be- coming incapable in old age of admitting the coloured powders ufed in inje£lions, which eafily pafs in youth. And, 3. From the bones of old creatures being more dif- ficultly tinged with madder than thofe of young ones. If authors have not miflaken, tlie arteries of bones have fome- times become very large {m). We may conclude, frorn arteries being accompanied with veins, fo far as we can trace them in every other part of the (/) Philofoph.

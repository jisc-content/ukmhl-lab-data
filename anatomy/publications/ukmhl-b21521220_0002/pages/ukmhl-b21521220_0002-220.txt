Part OF THE SKELETON. The vertebrae have already been dcfcribed as part of the fpine; and therefore are now to be palTed. T H E R I B S. The Ribs, or (^), (as if they were or guards, to thofe principal organs of the animal machine, the heart and lungs), are the long crooked bones placed at the fide of the cheft, in an oblique dire£tion downwards in refpeft of the back-bone.—Their number is generally twelve on each fide j though frequently eleven or thirteen have been found {/).—-Sometimes the ribs are found preternaturally conjoin- ed or divided [m). The ribs are all concave internally ; where they are alfo made fmooth by the a£Hon of the contained parts, which, on this account, are in no danger of being hurt by them 5 and they are convex externally, that they tnight refill that part of the prefiure of the atmofpKere which is not balan- ced by the air within the lungs during injp'iration. The ends of the ribs next the vertebra: are rounder than they are after thefe bones have advanced forwards, when they become flatter and broader, and have an upper and lower edge; each of which is made rough by the afilion of the intercoflal mufcles inferted into them. Thefe mufcles, be- ing all of nearly equal force, and equally ftretched in the interftices of the ribs, prevent the broken ends of thefe bones, in a fradlure, from being removed far out of their natural place, to interrupt the motion of the vital organs. —The upper edge of the ribs is more obtufe and rounder than tlie lower, which is depreflTed on its internal fide by a (i) nKtvpcUf sriptrcpycc, irs'a3’«i. ^ (/) Riolan.

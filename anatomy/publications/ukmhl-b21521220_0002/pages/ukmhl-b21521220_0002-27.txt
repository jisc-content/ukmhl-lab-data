Iiitrol. Patts of the Human Body. xvll tlons of membranes, efpeci.illy when they are very thin, are c^Wcd pe/lic'uhe \ and fonae membranous laminjc are united together by the intervention 6f a particular fubhance, coni- pofed of this fort of pellicles, and called the cellular or fpon- gy fubjlance. Veffeh are tubes, du£ls, or canals, more or lefs flex- ible, compofed of different membranes, the flrata of which are generally termed iun'ice or coats. Some of them are divided into branches, and thefe again into rami and ra- mifications, which gradually diminifh, but flill remain hol- low. The general defign'of the veflels is to contain fluids; from the diverfity of which they^’are diftinguiflted into blood-vefTels, vafa laftea, lymphatica, &c. The laft and fmaliefl extremities of all forts of vefTcls are generally term- ed capillaries^ The blood vejfels are of tWo kinds; one of which re- ceives the blood from the heart, and diftributes it to all the parts of the body, and are named arteries ; the other brings the b'ood from all the parts back to the heart, and are called veins; and fome of thefe have the name of finufes. lire arteries are thicker than the veins, and may be dlf- ilnguiflied by this mark in difle£ted dead bodies ; and in li- ving bodies they are known by a certain beating called the pulfe.\'Vht trunks of the veins lie nearer the furface of the body than the arteries, and are fnrnifhed with valves, that is, with fmall membranous facculi, fixed at different diflances to the fides of their cavities. The openings of thefe valves are broad, and. turned toward the heart •, but their bottoms are turned the contrary way. In fome places thefe valves arc Angle, in others double, triple, &c. By nerves^ anatomlfls mean the white ropes which pro- seed from the cerebrum, cerebellum, and foinal marrow. Vox.. I. c and

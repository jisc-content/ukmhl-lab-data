OF THE MUSCLES Part ir. 298 From that part, which is named its atitenor fuperior fpi- nous procefs^ it is ftretched tendinous to the os pubis, and is named Pouparfs or Fallopius^ ligament *. From this ligament it fends a tendinous layer, which is loll in the mem- branous fafcia of the thigh. ' Ufe. Supports and comprefles the peritonasum and ab» domen ; alhlls the evacuations of faeces and urine, and like- wife in the exclufion of the foetus ; thrufts the diaphragm upwards, and draws down the ribs In expiration •, bends the body obliquely when the ribs are fixed, and raifes the pelvis obliquely.

OBLr<2.uus Ascendens Internus, Arifes from the fpine of the ilium, the whole length be- tween the pollerior and fuperior anterior fpinous procefs ; from the os facrum and the three undermoft lumbar ver- tebrae, by a tendon common to it and to the ferratus polli- cus inferior mufclc; from Poupart’s ligament, at the mid- dle of which it fends off the beginning of the cremaller rnufcle ; and the fpermatic cord in the male, or round li- gament of the womb in the female^ palTes under its thin edge, except a few detached fibres. Inferied into the cartilago enfiformis, into the cartilages of the feventh, and thofe of all the falfe ribs; but, at the upper part, it is extremely thin, refembllng a cellular mem- brane, • Poupart's ot Fallopius's ligament is the inferior part of the tendon of the externus obliquus, extending from tire anterior fuperior fpinous procefs of the ilium to the os pubis, where it is thiokeft in order to ftrengthen the inferior part of the abdomen : here it is not inferted into any bone, but pafles over the blood vefTcIs of the inferior extremity ; and in women, from the greater fize of the pelvis, it is longer and loofer, by which they are more fubjeft to crural hernicE ; but, by the fi*e of the fpermatic cord, men are more liable to the inguinal.

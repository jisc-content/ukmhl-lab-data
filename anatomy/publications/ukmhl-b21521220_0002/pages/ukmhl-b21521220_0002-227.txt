Chap. ir. BONES OF THE TRUNK. 185 The twelfth rib is the fhorteft and ftraighteft. Its head is only articulated with the lad vertebra of the tho- rax 5 therefore is not divided into two furfaces. 1 his rib is not joined to the tranfverfe procefs of the verte- bra ; and therefore has no tpbercle, being often pulled necelTanly inwards by the diaphragm, which an articulation with the tranfverfe procefs would not have allowed. I'he folia is not found at its under edge, becaufe the vef- fcls run below it. The fore-part of this rib is fmallcr than its middle, and has only a very fmall pointed cartilage fixed to it. To its whole internal fide the diaphragm is conne£led. The motions and ufes of the ribs fhall be more particularly treated of after the defeription of the (lernum. The heads and tubercles of the ribs of a new-born child have cartilages on them ; part of which becomes afterwards thin epiphyfes. The bodies of the ribs encroach gra- dually after birth upon the cartilages ; fo that the latter are proportionally Ihorter, wh^ compared to the ribs, in adults than invchildren. Here I cannot help remarking the wife Providence of our Creator, in preferring us from perifiiing as foon as we come into the word. The end of the bones of the limbs remain in a cartilaginous ftate after birth, and are many years before they are entirely united to the main body of their feveral bones ; whereas the condytes of the occipital bone, and of the lower jaw, are true original procefles, and ofiified before birth ; and the heads and tubercles of the ribs are nearly in the fame condition : and therefore the weight of the large head is firmly fupported ; the a£lions of fucking, fwallowlng, refpiration, &c. which are'indif- penfably neceffary for us as foon as we come into the world, are performed without danger of feparating the parts of the bones that are mod prelTed on In thefe motions : Wheieas, had thefe procefies of the head, jaw, and ribs, VoL.

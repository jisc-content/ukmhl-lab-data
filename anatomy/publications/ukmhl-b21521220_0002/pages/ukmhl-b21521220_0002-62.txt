OF THE BONES Part 1. 2,0 veflels continue at a little diftance in their paflage, when the canal Is divided by a fmall bony partition or two. hrom the ftru£lure of the contents of the bones, we may judge how thefe parts, as well as others, may be fubjeft to oedema, phlegmon, eryfipelas, feirrhus, See. and may thence be led to a cure of each, before the common confequence, putrefacffion, takes place, which frequently occafions the . lofs of the lirnb, if not of the patient. The marrow is of very confiderable ufe to the bones : / > for by entering their tranfverfe canals, and paffing from them Into the longitudinal ones, it is commilnicated to all • the plates to foften and connect their fibres, whereby they are preferved from becoming too brittle ; as we fee they do , in burnt bones, or thofe long expofed to the air, in people labouring under old age, pox, or feurvy. ‘In all which cafes, the oil is either in too little quantity, or has its na- tural good qualities changed for worfe ones. Befides this advantage which the fubflance of bones has from the marrow, their articulations are faid (e) to receive no lefs benefit frojn it: for it is thought that the marrov/ pafTes into the articular cavities through the holes which are in the bones near the large joints. And as a proof of this it is alledged, that butchers, upon feeing the greater or Idler quantity of marrow in the bones of cows, can tell whether they have travelled far or little before they were flaughtered. When the fnarrow, after having ferved the ufes above mentioned, is reafTumtd into the mafs of blood (as it is con- tinually in common with all other fecreted liquors that have not pnfl'ages formed for conveying them out of the body), it correds the too great acrimony communicated to the faline particles of our fluids by their circulation and heat, in the fame manner' as lixivial falls are blunted by oil in making (e) Joan de Muralto Vade-mecum Anat. cxercit. 5. ^ 3.

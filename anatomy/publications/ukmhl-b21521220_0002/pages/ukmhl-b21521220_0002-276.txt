OF THE SKELETON. 234 Part I. and at the fame tirde to preferve its motions, by faring the proper mufcles. Below the external edge of the upper end of the tibia, there is a flat circular furface, covered in a recent fubje£l with cartilage, for the articulation of the fibula; between which and the anterior knob, a rough hollow affords origins to the tibialis anticus, and, extenfor digitorum longus. From this fmooth flat furface, a ridge runs obliquely downwards and inwards, to give rife to part of the folaeus, tibialis pofticus, and flexor digitorum lon- gus, and infcrtion to the aponeurofis of the femimembra* nofus which covers the poplitaeus, and to fome of the ex- ternal fibres of this laft-named mufcle. At the infide of this ridge an oblique plain furface is left, where the great- eft p:^rt of the mufculus poplitaeus ia.inferted. The remain- ing body of the tibia is triangular. The anterior angle is very fliarp, and is commonly called the /pine or Jhin {h). This ridge is not ftraight; but turns firft inwards, then , outwards, and laftly inwards again. The plain internal fide is fmooth and equal, being little fubje£led to the ac- tions of mufcles ; but the external fide is hollowed above by the tibialis anticus, and below by the extenfor digito- rum longus and extenfor pollicis longus. The two angles behind thefe fides are rounded by the action of the mufcles; the pofterior fide comprehended between them is not fo broad as thofe already mentioned, but is more oblique and flatted by the a£tion of the tibialis pofticus and flexor digi- torum longus.—A little above the middle of the bone, the internal angle terminates, and the bone is made round by the preflure of the mufculus foJteus. Near to this the paf- fage of the medullary velfels is feen flanting obliquely down- wards. The lower end of the tibia is hollowed, fo as to occafion a fmall protuberance to rife in the middle.

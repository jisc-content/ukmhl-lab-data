OF THE SKELETON. Part r. 86 \ ly acrofs the firft. The upper part of the perpendicular limb of the crofs, to which the falx is fixed, is hollowed in the middle, or often on one fide, for the reception of the fuperior longitudinal finus; and the lower part of it has the fmall or third procefs of the dura mater faftened to it, and is fometimes hollowed by the occipital finus. Each fide of the horizontal limb is made liollow by the lateral finufes inclofed in the tranfverfe procefs of the dura ma- ter; the fofla in the right fide being generally a continua- tion of the one made by the longitudinal finus in the per- pendicular limb, and therefore is larger than the left one (;•), ——Round the middle of the crofs there are four large d^preffions, feparated by its limbs; the two upper ones be- ing formed by the back part of the brain, and the two lower ones by the cerebellum. Farther forward than the lad mentioned depreffions, is the lower part of the fof- fa for the lateral finus on each fide. The inner furface of the cuneiform apophyfe is made concave for the recep- tion of the medtllla oblongata, and of the bafilar artery A furrow is made on each fide, near the edges of this pro- cefs, by a finus of the dura mater, which empties itfclf into the lateral finus (j). The holes of this bone are commonly five proper, and two common to it and to the temporal bones. The firft of the proper holes, called foramen magnum (/) from its fize, is immediately behind the wedge-like procefs; and allows a- pafiage to the medulla obldngata, nervi acceflbrii, to the vertebral arteries, and fometimes to the vertebral veins. At each fide of this great hole, near its fore part, and immediately above the condyles, we always find a hole, fometimes twcf,‘ which foon unite again ifito one, that opens I !i3i " externally; - . . 1 . ■ : I . . • .

f CofUpendious View of the pearance ; and as they are often mentioned, we fliall here give an explanation of them. / ExpUcaiwt of the general Terms of Anatomy > By Bones, we mean in general the hardeft, moll folid, and mofl: inflexible parts of the human body ; the particu- lar hiltory of which is contained in the defeription which fliall be given of the Dry Bones. A cartilage is a whitifli or pearl coloured fubftance, foft- er than a bone, but harder than any other part, fmooth, polifhed, pliable, and elaftlc. The cartilages {hall be ex- plained with the Dry Bones and Joints. A ligament is a white, fibrous, compa£l: fubftance, more pliable than a cartilage, difficult to be broken or to be torn,^ and yielding but a very little when drawn out with force. The ligaments fhall be explained at full length in the de- feription of the Joints. The name of fibre is given to fmall filaments, which ap- pear to be the moft fimple parts of the body, and which, by their different difpofition and connections, compofe all the other parts. The fibres differ in fubftance, being ei- ther membranous, flefhy, tendinous, or bony ; in direc- tion, being either ftraight, oblique, longitudinal, tranf- verfe, circular, or fpiral j and in fize, being either large, fmall, long, or fhort. By membrane, we underftand a pliable texture of fibres interwoven or difpofed together in the fame plane. They difler in thicknefs, according to the fmallncfs of their fibres' •and number of their planes. Thefe particular planes are termed lamina, and are diftinguilhed into external, inter- nal, middle, &c. The difference of membranes in general depends on that cf the fibres, of which they are compofed. Small por- tions

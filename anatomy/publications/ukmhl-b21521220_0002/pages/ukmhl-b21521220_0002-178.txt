Part I. OF THE SKELETON. 1 The body is the middle broad part, convex before and hol- low behind. The convex fore-part is divided into two by a ridge, into the middle of which the mylo-hyoidei, and into the Tides the Itylo-hyoidei, mufcles are inferted. Above the ridge, the bone is horizontal; but pitted in the middle by the infertion of the two genio-hyoidei mufcles, and a lit- tle hollowed more laterally by the bafio-gloffi. Below the ridge*, it is convex; but a little flatted in the middle by the fterno hyoidei, and pitted more externally by the coraco-hy- ' oidei.— The concavity behind faces backwards and down-- ■wards to receive the thyroid cartilage, when the larynx and the os hyoides are pulled towards each other by the adUon of , the fterno-hyoldei and hyo-thyroidei mufcles; and to its upper edge, the ligamentous membranes of the epiglottis, tongue^ and thyroid cartilage, are fixed. The cornua of the (a?) os hyoides are ftretched back- wards from each fide of' its body, where often a finall fur-i row points out the former feparatlon; for in young fub- jedls, the body and cornua are not one continued fub- Ifance, as they come afterwards to be in adults. Thefe cornua are not always ftraight, nor of an equal length; their two plain furfaces ftantj obliquely floping from above outwards and downwards.—Into the external, the cerato- I gloflis is inferted above, and the thyro-hyoideus mufcle be- low ; and to the one behind, the ligamentous membrane of the tongue and larynx adheres. Each of the cornua be- comes gradually fmaller aS it is extended from the bafe; ' but ends in a round tubercle, from which a moveable car- tilage ftands out, which is, connetSled to the upper procefs of the cartilago thyroidea. Where the body of the os hyoides joins on each fide with its cornua, a fmall ttyliform procefs, called appendix (^), « rifes fd) Crura, latera, infcriora.

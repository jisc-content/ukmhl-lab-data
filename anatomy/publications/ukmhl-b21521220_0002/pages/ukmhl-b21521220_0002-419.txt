377 OF MUSCULAR MOTION. Part II. mttfcle. There are inftances of numerous tendons, pennated in different places, formed into one mufcle. There are alfo other methods by which the tendinous fibres are joined with the flefhy ones. Within the cellular tunic that furrounds the fibres, the arteries and veins, running In company with each other, are fubdivided into net-works. From the fmaller of thefe veffels a vapour is exhaled into the thinner, and the fat is transfufed Into the thicker, cellular fubflance •, from whence again they are both abforbed by the lymphatic veffels ; which can be diflIn£Uy feen both on the furface and in the fub- ftance of the mufcles. ' The nerves of the mufcles are flill more evident. They are commonly very large ; and enter by fo many branches, that fome anatomlfls have confidered the mufcular fibres as formed by them. Several arguments are now offered a- gainft this opinion : one of the ftrongefl is, that mufcles in the limbs of animals do not flirlnk, although the nerves entering thefe mufcles have been cut through for a confi- derable length of time. (See Monro's Ohfervations on the Nervous Syjlem). The nerves enter the mufcles in a way fomewhat fimilar with that of the arteries and veins; but it Is impoffible to trace them a great way among the flefliy fibres, for they at length depofite their harder covering, and become foft, and difappear before they can be traced to their terminations. The fabric of the leafl fibres, which are fuppofed to be the elementary particles of a mufcle, being invefligated by the mlcrofcope in man and other animals, is found to be fimilar to that of the larger fibres, and they are all joined together by the intermediate cellular fubflance. The fur- face of thefe fibres, however, puts on a curious waved or zigzag appearance, as was formerly mentioned. This un- dulated appearance Profchafka thinks is nothing elfe than VoL.

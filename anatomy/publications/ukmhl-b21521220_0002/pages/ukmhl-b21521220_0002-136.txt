94 OF THE SKELETON. Part I. Euftachian tube (a). The fecond pair of external procefles of the cuneiform bone, is the two which Hand out almoft perpendicular to the bafe of the Ikull. Each of them has two plates, and a middle fofla facing backwards; and ihould, to carry on our comparifon, be likened to the legs of a bat; but are commonly faid to refemble the wings of that creature j-and therefore are named pterygoid or aliform {h) procefles. The external plates are broadeft, and the internal are longeft. From each fide of the external plates the pterygoid mufcles take their rife. At the root of each internal plate, a fmall hollow may be remarked, where the mufculus ptery-ftaphilinus internus or circumflexus palati rifes, and fome fhare of the cartilaginous end of the Eufta- chian tube refts; and, at the lower end of the fame plate, is a hook like rifing or procefs, round which the tendon of the lad-named mufcle plays, as on a pulley. From the edge of the external plates fome fmall fharp fpikes Hand out; but their number and bulk are uncertain. To thefe another pair may be added, to wit, the little triangu- lar thin procefs, which comes from each fide of the body of the fphenoid bone, where the pteregoid procefles arc ri- fing from it, and are extended over the lower part of the aperture of the finus as far as to join the ethmoid bone, while their body hangs down Into the nares (c). Befides thefe pair of procefles, there is a fharp,ridge which flands out from the middle of its bafe : Becaufe it wants a fellow, it may be called proccjfus azygos. The lower part of this procefs, where it is received into the vomer, is thick, and often not quite perpendicular, but inclining more to one fide than the other. The fore-part of this procefs, where it (a) Winflow Expof. anatomique du corps humain, traite des os fees, § 233. (i) Navicularcs, ' (c) Albin. Tab, Off. 5. fig. 2. 6. A. A. Berlin.

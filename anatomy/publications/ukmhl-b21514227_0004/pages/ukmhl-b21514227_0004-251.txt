THORAX. 1041 the body. The function of the chest, how- ever, as indicated by the quantity of air which we can expel, is in strict relation to the mi- nute difference of a single inch of stature, or to 10 lbs. of weight. It appears probable that the function of an organ may be exactly re- lative to the size of the body, increasing or decreasing with it, while the organ itself bears no visible relation of volume either to its own activity or to the dimensions of the body. The greatest perpendicular depth of the thoracic cavity, nearly corresponds with the greatest lateral measurement; or if the depth be 8-7 the breadth is 9"7, and allowing for the mobility of the base of the thorax, the depth may yet more closely correspond to the breadth. The average perpendicular depth of the female thorax exactly corresponds with the average breadth, being 8-l inches in both measure- ments. The greatest antero-posterior dia- meter in both sexes, i. e. from the sternum to the deepest part of the great lateral groove at the angle of the rib, is always less than the greatest lateral breadth, being as 6 to 9 in the male, and as 6 to 8 in the female. These diameters, however, in no way cor- respond to the stature. A man, 5 feet 4 inches high, measured from the apex of the chest to the base 10^ inches, whilst' a man of 5 feet 10 inches, only measured 7 i inches in the same direction, or the shorter man exceeded the taller by 3 inches in the per- pendicular depth of his thoracic cavity: — but the taller man could exceed the shorter by a volume of 77 cubic inches of air at one deep expiration.

1280 URINE. hippurates, and that it is not produced until the urine is evaporated to dryness. The following are two analyses, by Von Bibra, of the urine of oxen obtained at different times. The animals had been fed on clover and hay : — Water - - - 912-01 923'11 Urea - - - 1976 1021 Hippuric acid - - 5-55 12-00 Mucus - - - 0-07 0-06 Alcoholic extract - 14-21 10 20 Watery extract - - 22"48 16-4-3 Soluble salts - - 24'42 25'77 Insoluble salts - - 1"50 2-22 It will be perceived that the insoluble salts or earthy carbonates are in small proportion in the urine of oxen, while in the urine of horses they are present in about equal pro- portion to the alkaline carbonates. The urine of a cow, which was submitted to analysis by Boussingault, gave a result varying consider- ably from that obtained by Von Bibra from the urine of oxen, as above quoted. It yielded in 1000 parts: — Water 921-32 Urea 18-48 Hippurate of potassa - - 16-51 Lactate of potassa - 17-16 Bicarbonate of potassa - - 16-12 Carbonate of magnesia - - 4-74 Carbonate of lime - 0-55 Sulphate of potassa - - 3 60 Chloride of sodium - - 1'52 Silica, a trace. Phosphoric acid, none. The great excess of the earthy salts ob- served m the urine of horses, as compared with that of oxen, is a remarkable circum- stance, and would appear to be in some way connected with the difference in conformation of the two animals rather than on differences in diet. Thus the conditions alluded to per- tained whether the horses were fed on hay and oats, or on trefoil and vetches. The oxen too, the urine of which was examined by Von Bibra, were fed on hay and clover, a diet closely resembling that of the horses j but the earthy salts were, notwithstanding, found in the urine in very small proportion. Voo-el has examined the urine of the ele- phant&nd the rhinoceros. That of the elephant possessed the following characters : 1. It was turbid, owing to carbonates of lime and magnesia. 2. It contained more urea than the urine of the rhinoceros. 3 No hippuric acid was present.* The urine of the rhinoceros is described as follows:— . , „ 1 It was turbid, owing to the presence of carbonate of lime, earthy phosphates, silica and peroxide of iron. _ 2. It <*ave out the odour of formic acid. 3. It yielded hippuric acid in considerable quantity. * Brandes believed he detected the hippuric acid in this urine in combination with urea and an alkali. Chevreul examined the urine of the camel. 1. It contained no uric acid. 2. Urea was present in abundance. 3. No phosphates could be detected. 4. The chief constituents, in addition to urea, were chloride of sodium, hippurate of soda, carbonate of soda, sulphate of potassa, carbonate of ammonia, and traces of sulphate cf soda and oxide of iron. Chevreul considers this urine to contain a volatile oil to which it owes its colour, and to which he ascribes the property it possesses of becoming red on the addition of the mi- neral acids. The urine of frigs has been examined by Lassaigne, Van Setten, and Boussingault. Its specific gravity appears to vary between 1003 and 1013. Van Setten's analysis is as follows : — Water 990-028 Urea 0-750 Uric acid - - - - 0-195 Watery extractive - - 1-708 Alcoholic extractive - - 1-105 Resinous matter - 0 425 Albumen and mucus - - 0'721 Lactic acid - 0'490 Stearin ... - 0-092 Sugar ... - 0375 Phosphate of soda - - T376 Sulphate of potassa, chlorides of potassium and sodium - 2-075 Sulphates of lime and magnesia 0-425 Sulphate of ammonia - - 0'196 Chloride of ammonium - - 0-010 Von Bibra describes the urine of the pig as clear, odourless, and of alkaline re-action. He could not detect uric, hippuric, or benzoic acid in it when operating on three ounces of the fluid; but he subsequently obtained mi- croscopic crystals of hippuric acid. No trace of uric acid could be discovered. Boussingault could not detect hippuric acid in the urine of a pig fed on potatoes and salt. He varied the diet by the addition of green trefoil, but still he could not discover the acid. Von Bibra analysed the urine of the goat. He found it alkaline and of pungent odour, of specific gravity 1008 or 1009. The animals had been kept in a stable and fed on bad hay. From two analyses made on 1000 parts, the following results were obtained: — Water - - - 980'07 983-99 Urea - - - 3"78 0-76 Hippuric acid - - V25 0-88 Alcoholic extractive - 4'54 4-66 Watery extractive - l'OO 0\56 Mucus - - - 0-06 0-05 Soluble salts - - 8-50 8-70 Insoluble salts - - 0 80 0"40 In this urine, as in that of oxen, the alkaline carbonates greatly predominate over the earthy salts. According to Vanquelin, the urine of the beaver contains the colouring matter of the bark of the willow, which is the food of the

We found that the men from 5 feet to 5 feet 2 in. gave a mean vital capacity of 176 cub. in.; the men two inches taller a mean of 191 cub. inches ; the next, 207 cub. in., and so on ; thus the volume increases as we descend the column. Finding the progression so regular, we arranged a fourth column, containing a series of numbers in perfect arithmetical progression, commencing with 174, and increasing sixteen at every subse- quent step, corresponding to the two inches of height successively added. We found, upon comparing the two columns of observations with the column of calculation, that there was a close resemblance. The increase of sixteen for every two inches is of course the same as eight for every single inch; hence the rule deduced upon nearly 2000 cases (and subsequently confirmed by double that number) viz. That for every inch of stature, from 5 feet to Gfeet, eight additional cubic inches of air, at 60°, are given out by a forced expiration. This brings the detailed matter of a series of tables and calculations into a point, and easy of remembrance, the more so as extended ob- servations upon nearly 5000 men have brought the column of observation so close to the column of regular progression, that it is only necessary now to take the column of regular progression as a standard for examining the condition of the lungs as to their perme- ability for air, and the mobility of the tho- racic boundaries. If we recollect that at the height of 5 feet, Table V. —Vital Capacity Volume (temp. 60° F.) necessary to Health at the Middle Period of Life. Height.

These numbers may be taken as expressions of certain conditions of the thorax, an expression of mobility relative to breathing, and conse- quently an expression of the permeability of the lung. It therefore follows that whatever affects the mobility of the thoracic bound- aries, or the permeability of the lungs, the amount of that cause is expressed by the volume of the vital capacity. Incipient disease is quick in affecting the vital capacity; the amount of the injury therefore is readily measured. We are at a loss to assign any just reason why the vital capacity is rela- tive to the height, which is regulated by the length of the limbs, and not by the length of the trunk of the body. We have found by experiment, that whatever be the standing height, the sitting height is nearly the same in all persons of between 5ft. and 6ft., and if not actually the same, yet it is not a rule that the tallest men sit the highest ; for in- stance, one man standing 6ft. O^in. measured from his seat 2ft. 1 If in., whlie another who stood 5ft. 6in., sat 3ft. high ; therefore the length of the trunk bears no constant propor- tion to the length of the legs. And we found that men who stood low, breathed less than men who stood higher, but who sat the same height. Thus fig. 706. represents two men ; A. stood 4ft. 4|in., B. 5ft. 9iin.; they were of the same age and circumference of the chest. The weight of the short man was 7st. 2ilb., that of the taller man lOst. 31b. Yet their sitting height was precisely the same, as is shown in fig. 707. Nevertheless, the vital capacity volume of the shorter man was 152, and that of the taller man 236 cubic inches; so that the man who stood the shorter, but who sat as tall, if not taller, breathed eighty- four cubic inches less than the man who stood seventeen inches higher. The mobility of the chest of the taller man was nearly four inches, that of the shorter man three inches. We ex- amined several such cases with similar results. The average vital capacity volume at all heights is about 230 cubic inches. The greatest

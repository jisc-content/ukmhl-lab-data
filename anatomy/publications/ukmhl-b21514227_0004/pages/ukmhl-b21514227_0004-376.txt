The external sensations received through this medium all require the absolute contact* of the body which excites them, with the im- pressible part ; and in this respect, therefore, there is an exact correspondence between the general sensibility and the sense of taste. The force with which the impression is made, is judged of by the intensity of the sen- sation and the depth to which it is felt; whilst the size of the object is in some degree es- timated by the extent of surface over which its contact is perceived. Both these estimates, however, are extremely vague, when they depend only upon the general sensibility of the body ; we shall hereafter see how much more precise they become, when the impressions are received through the skin, which is the special organ of touch, and when they are aided and corrected by the muscular sense. Still we find that the different modes in which external objects affect even the general sensibility, produce a very marked diversity in the character of the sensations. Thus the feeling called forth by a prick is of a very different kind from that which arises from a blow; both, again, are very distinct from that produced by a steady uniform pressure; and all these are very different from the sensation of stretching or tearing. In the case of a prick, we have an intense impression made on the sensible part ; but this is limited to a very small spot ; whilst the impression of a blow is made with a like intensity over a much larger area.f In the case of steady pressure, on the other hand, the impression is made over a large surface, but is less in- tense ; whilst in stretching and tearing, the mechanical condition of the nerves of the part operated on is affected in a manner pre- cisely opposite to that in which it is acted on by pressure. The sense of shock, derived from a blow extending over a large surface, is very distinct from that of the mere blow, and may be experienced when little or no pain is felt, as from the "wind" of a shot; and nearly allied to this is the peculiar jar which is experienced, when the shock is transmitted in such a manner as especially to affect the solid casing of the nervous centres, — as when we jump from a height, without sufficient care to alight in such a * There might seem to be an exception to this statement in regard to heat and cold, which are perceived when their source is at any distance that allows its radiations to affect the temperature of the body itself. But, as will presently be shown, it does not appear that the sense of temperature forms part of the general sensibility of the body; the power of appreciating heat or cold, as such, being limited to the special organs of touch. t There can be no doubt that a multitude of pricks made at the same moment, in sufficiently close proximity to prevent them from being separately distinguished, would be felt as a blow; this being the only sensation which is received from the numerous incisions simultaneously made by the seariheator used in cupping, when it is applied to the parts of the skin endowed with the least discriminating power. manner as to deaden the concussion by the elasticity of the feet, &c. A succession of slight impulses rapidly following one another, gives rise to the peculiar sensation of thrill; which, though most readily excited when the impressions are made upon the skin, may be received through the internal organs also as when we hold a vibrating body between the teeth. These and other well-marked differences in the kind of information received through the general sensibility of the body, seem ob- viously attributable rather to diversities in the mode in which the impressions are made, than to any differences in the nature of the impressions themselves, the character of the fibres receiving them, or the endowments of the ganglionic centres in which these fibres terminate. And hence we seem to have a greater right to conclude, that the various affections of general sensibility, which are usually ranked under the common head of internal sensations, however unlike they may be one to another, are really derived from impressions which do not mutually differ so essentially as do those of the special senses from each other and from the general sense. Of this kind are the sensations of hunger and thirst, the "besoin de respirer," the genital sense, the sensation which calls for the expul- sion of the urine and fajces, nausea, the feelings of oppression and of" sinking" at the stomach, burning, itching, tingling, formication, and' others. However different these are from each other, when but slightly or moderately- excited, they all merge, when more strongly called forth, into the simple consciousness°of pain ; and it is further common to them all, that the nerves through which they are ex- cited are the same as those which commu- nicate the impressions that excite tactile sensations, and that mechanical irritation of any of these nerves occasions pain. To the foregoing may be added the " muscular sense," whereby we are informed of the degree of effort put forth by a muscle; and the sense of " fatigue," which seems to be a modifica- tion of this. We are not conscious either of effort or fatigue in the actions of any of the muscles over which the will has no "control, such as the heart, the muscular walls of the intestinal canal, &c; nor in the case of those whose actions are purely rhythmical, as those of respiration. It is, in fact, only when the will is exerted, either in increasing the force of their contractions, or in antagonising them by the operation of some other muscles, that we become conscious of effort; and we shall hereafter see that this sense is most important, in enabling us to proportion the amount of force we exert to the resistance to be over- come, and in guiding us with regard to the direction in which exertion is required. A sense of effort and of fatigue seems also to be excited in the sensorium by the mental opera- tions of which the cerebrum is the instrument; especially when these mental operations are no longer spontaneous, or carried on with facility, but when they require a more or less

Viverra Nasua. — Thyroid : wings united at an obtuse angle. Cricoid semitransparent. * Vicq. d'Azyr states that the vocal ligaments are absent, but this is denied by Brandt. f He is also in error in stating that the epiglottis is absent in the common bat. \ Brandt thinks that the interarticular cart, of Mammalia is represented by the Cricoid of Birds; but, as Henle' observes, there seems to be little foundation for this opinion. § Wolff. ]| These cartilages have been confounded with each other by Cuvier and Wolff. 5 c

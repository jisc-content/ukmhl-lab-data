1272 URINE. been published by the following observers, viz. Marchand, Simon, Becquerel, Leh- mann, &c. I shall quote several of these from the work of Franz Simon, which has been excellently translated into English by Dr. Day, for the Sydenham Society. Simon analysed two specimens of the urine of a healthy man, 33 years of age. He was of sanguineous temperament. The specific gravity was in the first case 1011, and in the second 1012. 1000 parts yielded — Water - Urea - Uric acid Alcoholic extractive, free lactic acid Spirituous extractive Extractive, soluble in water only, and ves- ical mucus Lactate of ammonia Chloride of ammo- V nium - - - J Chloride of sodium - Sulphate of potassa - Phosphate of soda - Phosphates of lime") and magnesia - J Silicic acid } 1st. 963-20 12-46 0-52 5-10 I 2-60 T3 03 1-00 }■ 1- 03 0-41 5 20' 3-00 2- 41 0-58 a trace k 3 2nd. 95600 14-578 0-710 4- 800 5- 590 2-550 g o w i 7-280 3-508 2-330 0654 a trace. The urine of the same individual was also examined under three varying conditions, as follow: —A, on rising in the morning, several glasses of water having been drunk the pre- vious evening ; B, water and some coffee taken, and violent exercise had recourse to during two hours, pulse 100, with occasional intermissions ; C, urine voided half an hour after urine B. These urines were all acid; C most so, and B the least. All three speci- mens were clear, and B the least coloured. The following is the result of the analyses : A. B. c.

Lehmann has analysed the urine collected during 24 hours, from a well-fed and healthy young man. The following three results were thus obtained by him: — 1, 2. 3.

This is very high, indeed, as an average of 24 hours. The mean composition of urine is stated by Becquerel as follows: — Mean from four health} Men. Mean from four healthy Women.

The variations caused in the urine by the ingestion of various mineral substances, and of organic compounds taken either as food or medicine, have attracted the attention of several chemists of eminence. Liebig has theorised freely on this subject, and it is but right that what he has published should be copied into this article, if only as part of the history of the urine, while I would warn the reader carefully to separate in his mind the matters of fact from the theoretical part of the subject, inasmuch as a great deal yet remains to be done. The position of the inquiry is indeed at present such, that further advances may very probably lead us to detect the fallacy of theories which, it is to be feared, the pre-

E, Mammal (Horse). became ossified, and, together with the cerato- hyal, coalesce with the basi-hyal. As in their previous condition they subserved to respira- tion, so now they do the same — as they before supported the branchiae, so now they support the trachea and larynx : they may be always recognized by this relation, — the}' always embrace the commencement of the air-passages in their fork, being especially connected with the first segment of the carti- laginous framework of those passages, namely, the thyroid cartilage ; the universality of this relation has induced Professor Owen to name them, in air-breathing vertebrata, thyro-hyals (Jig. 760. C,D, B,kb,cb). In birds (Jig.760. C and D), the elements of the true hyoid arch are either rudimentary or suppressed, while the hypo- and ccrato- branchials (k b, c b) are enormously deve- loped. The basi-hyal (b h) is generally elongated proportionately to the shape of the tongue, and to its anterior extremity is usually attached a glosso-hyal (g h), to its posterior a stilif'orm uro-hyal (u //) which is prolonged be- neath the trachea. In C, which represents the hyoid apparatus of the crane (Grus cinerea), the glosso-hyal is seen to be wanting, and two rudimentary cerato-hyals (c h), lesser corrma, to be attached to the anterior extremity of the basi-hyal. In D is represented the hyoid apparatus of the woodpecker (Picus); the parts are seen to be very long and slender, furnishing the means for the lengthened pro- trusion of the tongue in pursuit of food. All the bones are seen to be linear; there is a long basi-hyal (b h), surmounted by an arrow- shaped glosso-hyal (g h), while two slender hypo-branchials (It b,) (greater cornita) are

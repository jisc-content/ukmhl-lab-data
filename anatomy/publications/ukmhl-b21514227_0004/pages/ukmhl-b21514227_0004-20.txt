812 STATISTICS. So that instead of asserting, as we should seem justified in doing, that the mortality under the influence of the treatment adopted amounted to 15 per cent., we could only claim a mortality comprised between the numbers 185,707 and 114,293 in 1,000,000 cases: or approximatively between the numbers, 19 and 1 1 per cent. Uncorrected observation, therefore, would give, as the result of the treatment adoptetl, 15 per cent., while corrected observation would give some number between 19 and 11 per cent. The application of the formula given in the note to an actual case will be more instruc- tive than an imaginary example. M. Louis, in his Recherckes sar la Fievre Typho'idc, has attempted to illustrate the treat- ment of typhus fever, by minutely analysing 140 cases. The result was as follows : — Number of deaths (m) 52 Number of recoveries 88 Total - O) 140. The mortality in these cases was therefore t%j or 0 37143 ; and if we were to take this mortality as the strict expression of the re- sults of the treatment adopted, we should shape our proposition as follows : — The mor- tality of typhus fever, under the treatment adopted by M. Louis, amounted to 37,143 deaths in 100,000 patients ; or, in round numbers, 37 deaths in 100 patients If, now, we proceed by means of the formula referred to, to determine the possible error at- taching to this proposition (i. e. to the num- ber of facts upon which it is made to rest), we finct it to be equal to 2 / 2 . m . n 2 / 2 . 52 . 88 {/ = \f ThoT^ = °'11530- This being the possible error in excess and defect, the true influence of the treat- ment will be comprised between the following limits: — vi 2 / 2 vt ?? -+ / -^=0-37143 + 0-11550=0-48093 and m 2 /2.m.n — . / —=0-37143—0-11550=0-25593. h V M Thus all that we really learn from this re- cord of experience is, that, under the treat- ment adopted, the number of deaths may vary between 48,693 and 25,593 in 100,000 patients, or approximatively between 49 and 26 in 100 patients. In other words, if we were to employ the same mode of treatment in a great number of cases of typhus fever, we might lose any number between about a fourth and a half of our patients.* The same formula is equally applicable to the solution of doubtful questions relative to the results of two or more series of facts which * Gavavrct, Prineipes Ge"ne'raux ile Statistiquc Me'dicale, p. 284. we are desirous of comparing. It may happen that the difference between the average result of one series of facts and that of a second series, is so inconsiderable, as to leave us in doubt whether it may not be explained by a reference to the limits of error to which the number of facts in either return is liable.* It often happens, that the average results of two series of observations relating to two alternative events (such as the events of death or recovery in particular diseases, the birth of a male or female child, &c.) approxi- mate so closely, that we are at a loss whether to attribute the slight difference existing be- tween the two averages to coincidence, or to the operation of certain efficient causes. If the number of observed facts be small, the difference between the averages derived from the two series of facts may be so slight as to fall short of the difference between the limits of error in excess or defect. The same re- sult may also happen with any number of facts, however considerable. In order to solve the doubts which necessarily attach to such close approximations, a mathematical formula has been brought into requisition, and employed in the formation of tables ap- plicable to this purpose. Such a table is subjoined. The mode of applying it will be presently explained. The use of this table will be understood from the following example : — In the six years 1839-44 there occurred in England, on the average of those years, 515,478 births, of which 264,245 were males, and 251,233 fe- males. As the difference between these two numbers is not very considerable, a question might arise, whether that difference is not compatible with the error in excess to which half a million of facts is liable. The use of the formula on which the foregoing table is founded, would at once clear up this doubt. 264,245 male births in a total of 515,478, is equal to 512,904 male births in 1,000,000 births. But, on the supposition that the male and female births are really equal in number, we have the limits of variation equal to 500,000 + A /— and 500,000—A /- , 2,„^ A/ 515478 A/ 515478, or 500,0004 000,624 and 500,000—000,624, or a maximum of 500,624, and a minimum of 499,376. The difference by the formula is, therefore, 1248 in the million, while the ob- served difference between the highest and lowest number of male births occurring in the six years 1839-44, is 514,809—511,781, or 3,028. The inference, therefore, is irresist- ible, that the excess of male births is due to some efficient cause or causes, and that it is not merely an error to which the number of half a million of facts is inevitably exposed.f * For illustrations of this application of the fore- going table, and of the formula fromwhich the figures are calculated, see Gavarret's Statistique Me'dicale, p. 80. et scq., and notes, p. 274. t Several applications of this table and of the formula from which the figures are derived, will be

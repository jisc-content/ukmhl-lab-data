The Effect of Age on the Vital Capacity. 30 years, and from 30 to 60 it decreases 43 cubic inches, or 1*43 (nearly l j- cubic inches) per year, or 7 cubic inches in 5 years, or 14£ cubic inches in 10 years. Al- though this appears by calculation, yet we do not strictly follow this ratio, as we find by experience that the effect of age may be more diminished, as follows : — Table D D. — Vital Capacity at three Periods of Life, from 4800 cases (males).

We have not brought in the effect of time before the age of 55 years. This is supposed to be at the mean weight. The first column is derived from observation, the two second are derived from calculation. 6th. Of the effect of disease upon the vital capacity. — The effect of disease upon re- spiration was well known to Boerhaave and Morgagni, they considered that the disturb- ance of any organ in the body would dis- order the whole function of respiration. Morgagni devotes more than one-sixth of his celebrated work, the " Seats and Causes of Disease" " to diseases which affect respiration" We may safely say all thoracic and abdominal diseases, as tumours, abscesses, and acute in- flammations, will affect the respiration. Of the different respiratory volumes, we select that one which requires the most extended mo- bility, viz. the vital capacity, which becomes altered to an extent commensurate with that of any disease physically affecting our respiration, it is therefore a test of the pre- sence and extent of such diseases. Such movements as command this volume, extend from the neck to the plantar muscles of the feet. One condition which we have been accus- tomed to look upon as affecting our breathing, does not affect it, viz. old pleuritic adhesions. Fig. 710. ft. in. Heights. £g 0 Healthy. Diseased.

THORAX. 1074 as yet the relation does not appear so regular as that of the height. We are scarcely in a position, at present, safely to say much upon this point. As a general rule we find the weight increases with the height; so that it is not easy to separate the effect of one from that of the other. Suppose we take two men of the same stature, say 5 feet 8 inches, the one 10 stone, the other 14 stone in weight; one of them above par, the other may be either at, or below par. If 10 stone be considered par, the 14 stone man is 4 stone in excess, or corpulent to 40 per cent. This excess weight blocks up the range of mobility, and thus, mechanically, diminishes the vital capacity volume. But let us suppose men of dissimilar heigths, one 5 feet 8 inches and the other 6 feet; the 6 foot man should be heavier than the shorter man ; — say 3 stone heavier. This is not excess weight with him, and does not interfere with his thoracic mobility; therefore there is an inseparable relation between the height and weight. If, in a series of experiments, we sink the height entirely, and keep the mere weight in view, we shall find that the result as to the vital capacity volume is without order.

We have also found the mean vital capa- city of 147 men of 11 stone as 225 cubic inches, and that of 32 men of 14 stone, only 233 cubic inches, an increase of 8 cubic inches for an increase of 42 lbs., or 3 stone. The over- whelming effect of height disturbs the above observation; therefore the height must be kept in view. We have calculated the weights in relation to height, with reference to the res- piratory function, upon a number of men at the middle period of life. Besides the three classes mentioned above, we have included 1554 cases of healthy men in the prime of life, oblig- ingly furnished by Mr. Brent, viz. the Oxford and Cambridge rowers, London watermen, cricketers, pedestrians, and gentlemen ( Table X). The weight now appears more regular, increasing with the height, as from 92 lbs. to 218 lbs. We may make this progression ap- pear more regular, as in Table Y, which is calculated by adding the mean weight, from the last table, of the men from 5 feet to 5 feet 2 inches (the mean of which is of course 5 ft. 1 in.), together, and taking the mean of that, which will be found 119 9 lbs.; and the Height.

(or 61 lbs.) for every inch of stature from 5 feet 7 inches to 6 feet, and 6-2 lbs. for every inch of stature from 5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 4 inches, and 3-3 lbs. for every inch from 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 7 inches. At 5 feet 8 inches, or 68 inches of stature, the weight is 155*2 lbs., or nearly 11 stone ;

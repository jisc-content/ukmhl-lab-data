The perpendicular lines represent the ribs; and the curves the characters re- ferred to. By a general view it will be seen that all the lines curve upwards, and are at their highest at about from the 5th to the 9th rib. We shall not treat of particular ribs, but of certain characteristics as they run through the ribs. A knowledge of their shape is ne- cessary to comprehending the respiratory movements in diagnosing thoracic disease. I, Length. — The length of a rib may be taken in three ways, — its absolute length, chord length, and versed-sine length. (a) Absolute length.—In the length from the anterior to the posterior extremity, (a c b, fig. 664.) the 12th rib is the shortest. The 11th rib is nearly double the length of the 12th rib ; likewise the 2nd rib is nearly double the length of the 1st rib ; therefore the 1st and 2nd, and the 11th and 12th differ more re- markably in their length than do any of the other ribs. The length (curve a, fig. 665.) suddenly increases up to the 4th rib ; and then the difference is trifling to the 8th rib ; after this the shortening is as rapid as in the four superior ribs. (b) Chord length. —The dotted line b,fig. 665, represents this measurement. This length from tip to tip (a b, fig. 664.) of the rib is the chief modifier of the different apparent mobility of particular ribs. If we allow the range of costal movement to be the same in each rib, while each succeeding rib increases in its chord length, the apparent mobility in different ribs will increase exactly as their chord measurement increases. If a rib be three inches long, and if its free extremity by a given movement passes through one inch of space, the free extremity of a rib six inches long will, with the same absolute movement, pass through two inches. The chord length is an important element in modifying thoracic capacity. It is in this measurement that the 1st rib is the shortest and nearly one half the length of the 2nd rib, — as 2* is to 3-75. (Table A.) The chord length (line b, fig. 665, com- pare with line a,) increases and decreases less abruptly than that of the absolute length. If we were to admit that all the ribs at their fulcra possessed the same extent of mo- tion, still the antero-posterior length of the thorax would be unequally increased, and that exactly in relation to the chord measurement; Fig. 665.

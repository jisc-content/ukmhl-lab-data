URINE. 1292 ally neutral. Its specific gravity is nearly always lower than that of health. The uric acid is usually in very small proportion, and sometimes altogether absent. This is not, however, always the case; and I have some- times seen the lithic acid in excess existing as a deposit. Simon believes albumen not unfrequently present in diseases quite uncon- nected with affections of the kidneys. His facts, however, are not satisfactorily stated, and I believe him to have been greatly mis- taken in this opinion. In connection with the morbus Brightii, we have to notice two substances which, according to Heller, are often present as deposits in that disease, viz. uroglaucin and urrhodin. These are colour- ing matters, derived by oxidation from uro- xanthin, or a yellow colouring matter of urine, which exists only in small proportion in healthy urine, but which is greatly increased in Bright's disease. The deposits observed in the morbus Brightii consist of the casts of the urinary tubules of the kidney — epi- thelium of two kinds, viz. spheroidal and pavement epithelium. ( Vide woodcut of urin- ary deposits, Jig. 799.) Cystitis. The urine in this disease is alkaline, the alkalinity increasing rapidly after the urine is voided, owing to the formation of carbonate of ammonia. Mucus and pus are present in quantity. Albumen can always be detected in solution when the pus corpuscles are pre- sent in the deposit. As cure is effecting, this albumen is found to decrease in propor- tion as the pus corpucles disappear. Tvphus. In typhus the urine shows no great va- riation from the normal standard, so far as specific gravity and amount of solid consti- tuents is concerned. The urea is generally in deficient proportion, the uric acid in- creased. The salts are much diminished. During the progress of typhus, the urine very generally becomes alkaline. Becquerel and Andral have made many experiments on the state of the urine both in typhus and typhoid fevers. They both have met with a large number of cases in which it was precipitable by nitric acid ; this is quite in accordance with my own observations ; the precipitate, how- ever, is lithic acid, and not albumen. Scherer found, like former observers, that the salts were much decreased in the urine of typhus, and that there was always an excess of uric acid. The following analyses are worthy of note. They were made by Scherer at the 9th, 12th, and 15th day of a slow nervous fever, which occurred in the person of a woman aged thirty- eight years. 9th Day. Water 945-48 Urea 8-60 Uric acid ....

The " salts so- luble in water" also diminished in quantity. Intermittent Fever. L'Heritier has made analyses of the urine in this disease, and has drawn up the follow- ing table, which represents its composition in the different stages, as deduced from a mean obtained from twelve cases.

Cholera. In this disease the urine is often altogether suppressed. When it can be collected in any quantity, its specific gravity is generally below the natural standard, and it has only a feeble acid reaction. Albumen is very often to be found it it. The urea is below the standard of health. Vogcl states that the urine, in a case of this disease which he examined, was entirely wanting in the salts of lime and mag- nesia, and that the chloride of sodium was deficient. The sulphates, however, were in larger proportion than in health. Albumen and biliary colouring matter could be detected by the appropriate tests. «

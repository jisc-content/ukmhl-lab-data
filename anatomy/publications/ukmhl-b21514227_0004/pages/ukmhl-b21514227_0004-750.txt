1536 ANALYTICAL INDEX. Skeleton (.continued). the five lumbar vertebra? are proportionals metamor- phosed from five sternal costo-vertebral archetypes, 630. the sacro-coccygeal series of vertebra? are proportionals degraded from sternal costo-vertebral circles, 631. the seven cervical vertebrae are proportionals degraded from seven sterno-costo-vertebral whole quantities, 631. the mammalian spinal axis consists of a series pf seg- mental quantities, whose only variety or specific dis- tinction depends upon proportioning from the whole thoracic quantities, 031. uniformity of structure is a condition proper to the plus thoracic originals of the spinal axis of the mamma, lian body, 632. every spinal segment which is lesser refers to every spinal segment which is greater, and all lesser seg- ments refer to that which is greatest, 633. structural uniformity cannot characterise such spinal segments as are proportionally or quantitatively va- rious, 633. specific variety is none other than proportional variety, 633. the knowledge of the differential quantity between all spinal segments renders them exactly uniform in idea, 633. without knowing the full dimensions of whole or uni- form quantities, we can never rightly understand the real character of lesser and special forms, and there- fore can never otherwise understand the law of formation, 634. the mammalian cervix is not limited to the fixed num- ber of seven cervical vertebra?, 634. the number of ceivical vertebra? in the mammal cervix depends upon the number of archetypal costo-ver- tebral figures which have suffered metamorphosis, 635. the presence of cervical ribs subtracts from the number of cervical vertebra;, and adds to the number of thoracic archetypes, 636. the length of the thorax depends upon the number of persistent costo-vertebral archetypes, 636. the numerical length of the lumbar spinal region de- pends upon the number of archetypes subjected to metamorphosis, 637. the numerical length of the sacral and coccygeal series is not fixed, and this is owing to the same fact of archetypes undergoing metamorphosis, 637. a comparison of the same numerical vertebra? in all human spinal axes will prove the truth of the pre- sent interpretation of the law which governs the development of all vertebral forms, not only in the same spine, but all other spines, 637. the anomaly is a link in the chain of form, 638. all the spinal segments of all classes and species of ver. tebrated animals are only as the variable propor- tionals of sterno-costo-vertebral archetypes, 638. the hyoid apparatus occurs opposite to the cervical spinal region, where we know costal quantity to be lost; the hyoid apparatus refers to the cervical ver- tebra;, and consists of their ribs metamorphosed, 640. the ventral apparatus occurs opposite to the lumbar spinal region, where we understand that costal quan- tity is lost; the ventral apparatus refers to the lumbar vertebra;, and consists of their ribs metamorphosed, 643. clavicles, coracoid bones, and ribs are identical parts of the costo-vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, 644. marsupial bones, pubic and ischiadic bones and ribs, are identical parts of the costo-vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, 648. chevron bones and ribs are identical parts of the costo- vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, 650. the sternal median line ranges from the maxilla to the pubic bones of the abstract archetypal skelatal fabric, 651. every fossil skeletal species of extinct animals, as well as every recent existing species of skeleton, are forms created of the archetypal skeleton, 655. the cranio-facial apparatus consists, like the thoracic apparatus, of variable proportionals of the sterno- costo-vertebral quantities, 655. the scapulary or fore-limbs of all the vertebrated ani- mals are homologous to one another ; the variety among these organs occurs by a metamorphosis or omission of elementary quantity, 661. the scapulary and pelvic members are homologous, 654. the sterno-costo-vertebral quantily is a proportional of the dorso-ventral quantity, 667. the scapulary and pelvic pairs of limbs are proportional quantities metamorphosed from the dorso-ventral archetypes, 669. the cranio-facial apparatus of segments are propor- tionals of the dorso-ventral archetypes, 673. the cranio-facial apparatus is the origin of the dorso- ventral archetypal series, and the caudal apparatus is its termination, 673. the uniform archetypal series undergoes a graduated metamorphosis of its quantities for the production of all varieties of skeletal species, 674.

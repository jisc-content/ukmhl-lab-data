The contained blood is usually very dark, and the spleen shares the deepening of colour. By long duration, the capsule of the organ and the fibrous tissues generally, be- come somewhat thickened, but in other re- spects the texture is little altered. In the second class, in which the swelling is pro- bably produced by a peculiar state of the blood (dyscrasia), and is certainly associated with a class of blood diseases, the texture of the organ is usually much altered. The size of the spleen is often astonishingly increased, so that it possesses a volume of from 100 to 300 cubic inches, and a weight of 10-20 lbs. The increase includes, besides blood, a considerable quantity of a fibrinous material, the nature of which, and its relations to the healthy organ, are at present little known. The colour and consistence are of every possible gradation; from greyish to deep brownish red, or from a soft, friable mass, to a dense, firm, and almost fibrous texture. There is a general relation of these changes to the date and duration of the swelling ; thus in acute or recent cases, the organ is usually soft and of a dark colour, while by long continuance, or in chronic diseases, its consistence is greatly increased, and its colour, as well as that of the contained blood, is much paler or greyer than natural. Atrophy of the spleen, or slow and permanent diminution of its size, is much more infrequent than the preceding converse condition. It is associated with similar varieties of colour and consistence. Inflammation of the spleen. — The peritoneal surface of the organ shares in the diseases of this structure generally, and an inflammation of this part of the serous membrane not un- frequently accompanies the enlargements pre- viously mentioned. The exsudation and re- sults are no way peculiar. Concerning in- flammation of the parenchyma of the splten little can at present be said. The large and numerous veins which it contains are liable to inflammation, the secondary being the more frequent form of phlebitis which affects them. As regards other morbid products, organ- ised and unorganised, the spleen offers no- thing deserving a special notice. Bibliography. — M.

La Methode Numerique. — It is to be regretted that the use of numbers in any branch of scientific inquiry should have seemed to need a special name ; for the name has given rise to prejudices and misconceptions which could never have attached to the thing signified. There is no science which has not sooner or later discovered the absolute necessity of re- sorting to figures as measures and standards of comparison ; nor is there any sufficient reason why physiology and medicine should claim an exemption denied to every other branch of human knowledge. On the con- trary, they belong in an especial manner to the class of sciences which may hope to de- rive the greatest benefit from the use of num- * The Editor is indebted to his friend Dr. Brinton, for the translation of the article on the normal anatomy of the spleen from the German MSS. of Professor Kolliker, and for the sketch of the abnor- mal anatomy. 3 F802 STATISTICS. bers ; and even those persons who are most given to express doubts of the necessity or expediency of resorting to them, find them- selves constrained to sanction by their own practice what they condemn in theory. This is an all-sufficient answer to those who con- tent themselves with objecting in general terms to the employment of numbers in me- dical investigations. As to more minute and detailed objections, these will be found to be anticipated and disarmed by the simple con- sideration that they apply in reality not to the use, but to the abuse of numbers. The time has long gone by, when the absolute dependence of all science on observation and experiment could admit of question or dis- pute ; and, as no one in the present day claims for physiology and medicine any im- munity from the severe conditions which the very nature of things imposes, we are spared those appeals to authority which might for- merly have been required at our hands. The absolute necessity of observation and experi- ment towards the improvement of the science and art of medicine, in the widest acceptation of those terms, may, therefore, be safely taken for granted. The only points upon which any serious difference of opinion or divergence of practice exists, are the degree of care and accuracy which should be brought to bear on individual observations and experiments, the properties which fit single facts to be thrown into groups or classes ; the language which ought to be employed in expressing the ge- neral results of such classifications ; and the number of facts which, being so grouped or classified, may be required to establish a ge- neral proposition, or to furnish an accurate test or trustworthy standard of comparison. The human mind is so constituted, that it looks forward to an occurrence with a con- fidence proportioned to the number of times that it has been previously known to happen. Hence, the universal belief that all living beings will die, and that the sun will rise and set to-morrow ; hence, the somewhat less sanguine expectation that quinine will cure ague, and that vaccination will either pre- vent or modify small-pox; hence, the little hope we have that a severe attack of Asiatic cholera will terminate favourably, and our absolute despair of the recovery of a patient seized with hydrophobia. In these, and other analogous cases, we have either the expe- rience of all mankind in all times and places, or that of large numbers of men in addition to our own. We do not require that the in- dividual occurrences which have created our confidence, our misgiving, or our despair, should be committed to paper, arranged in columns, and embodied in sums or averages. For practical purposes we are satisfied with our own impressions. But should a doubt be expressed, and supported by a show of reason or experience, whether vaccination possess the virtue generally attributed to it ; should some new preventive measure or mode of treatment be recommended in cholera, as su- perior to other plans previously adopted ; we ask for the specific facts which have seemed to warrant the doubts of the one party, and the recommendation of the other. If these facts are few, we naturally view them with mistrust, and are disposed to attribute them, at the best, to some coincidence ; or if, being more in number, their actual amount is stated in vague and general terms, we as naturally demand the precise figures. We feel instinc- tively, that common and familiar words are altogether wanting in precision; that they take their meaning from the character of those who use them ; that, in a word, " the sometimes of the cautious is the often of the sanguine, the always of the empiric, and the never of the sceptic ; while the numbers, 1, 10, 100, 1000, have but one meaning for all mankind." But this mistrust of vague generalities of expression, is not the only form in which the more cautious and logical spirit of modern times embodies itself. The same misgivings are felt and expressed as to the propriety of committing the facts which are to serve as the materials of our theories to the uncertain keep- ing of the memory. We feel that a science built up of such materials, bears to true science the same sort of relation which tradition bears to history. It may not be destitute of valu- able truths and sound principles, but it must fail in that precision and delicacy of discrimi- nation which forms the peculiar attribute of true science as of true history. The history of medicine abounds with examples of impor- tant principles of treatment, and valuable re- medies discovered solely by the light of experience, based upon the mere recollection of a number of individual occurrences. In this way the efficacy of bark and arsenic in ague, of mercury in syphilis, and of iodide of potassium in certain forms of secondary disease was discovered. Indeed, it may be confidently affirmed that all our knowledge of remedies is traceable to this source ; and it is probable that we shall continue to be indebted to it for all future discoveries of importance. It is the natural method of discovery, and, as such, will necessarily maintain its ground. But a very little reflection will convince us of the utter inadequacy of this method to meet the strict requirements of the science, and the ever-vary- ing exigencies of the art of medicine. We may be able by its aid to sketch the broad out- lines, and mark the salient points of a science, but we cannot hope to fill in the details with all the lights and shadows which go to make up the perfect landscape. Still less can we satisfy ourselves or others as to the real merits of disputed questions by an appeal to un- written or loosely recorded experience. We all feel that there is no solution for our doubts short of an appeal to observations carefully and faithfully recorded, and summed up in the clear and simple language of figures. The use of mercury in syphilis, supplies us with an apt illustration of this truth. An experience, founded upon unrecorded and unnumbered occurrences, first recommended this remedy for the treatment of that disease ; but it would803 STATISTICS. 3 F 2 appear that a counter experience of the same kind was continually leading to its disuse. Thus Morgagni tells us that, when he was quite a young man and went to Bologna, both methods of using mercury, internal and ex- ternal, were so far deserted, that he never saw any physician make use of them, or ever heard of his using them, for the whole space of eight years, during which he studied there.* It would also appear that from the beginning of the sixteenth century up to the present time, there has always been a large number of sur- geons, who have either abandoned the mer- curial treatment altogether, or have restricted the use of the mineral to certain exceptional cases.f In the difference of opinion which prevailed upon this subject, the necessity of submitting the question at issue to the test of figures made itself so strongly felt, that a series of the most elaborate inquiries was undertaken at the instigation of governments, or by private individuals. These inquiries resulted in the collection of nearly 80,000 facts, by means of which the possibility of promptly healing ve- nereal sores without mercury and with but moderate risk of a relapse, or of the occurrence of secondary symptoms, was conclusively esta- blished.:}; To this same test of figures, all the questions which arise from time to time, as to the relative value of the several remedies recom- mended in the treatment of syphilis are, by common consent, submitted. A most con- vincing proof that the numerical method is, in all cases of doubt and difficulty, the means of solution to which men naturally resort, is af- forded by the treatise of Benjamin Bell, on this very subject, published in the year 1793.§ Speaking of the treatment of incipient chancres by caustic, he notices the very important ob- jection, that the cure of the sores was often succeeded by buboes ; and he adds, that for a considerable time he was induced to suppose that the swellings of the glands, which thus take place after the cure of chancres, were more the effect of accident than of the method of treatment, and that they would have oc- curred under whatever management the sores might have been. The frequency, however, of their appearance, led him at last to suspect that he was mistaken, and further observation made it obvious that this was the case. He goes on to observe, " As experiment alone could determine the question, I was resolved to employ this test. Of the first twenty patients who occurred with incipient chancres, in ten they were destroyed by an immediate and effectual application of lunar caustic, the remedy being employed, according to my usual custom at that time, instantly on my being called ; of the other ten, five were dressed with blue mercurial ointment, and five with common wax ointment. The sores to which caustic * Morgagni's 58th Epistle. t See on this subject, the British and Foreign Medical Review, vol. v. p. 4.

By Benjamin Bell, vol. ii. p. 322. were applied healed much sooner than the others, and next to them the sores that were dressed with mercurial ointment. But of the ten patients to whom caustic was applied, no less than eight had buboes, whilst only one bubo occurred in all the others; and it happened in one of the patients whose chancres had been dressed with mercury. I thought also that buboes appeared to be less frequent from the application of caustic, where mercury had been previously given. This fell within my ob- servation from time to time, with patients who had taken mercury, either of their owiraccord or by the advice of others ; and appearing to be of importance, I was resolved to bring it like- wise to the test of experiment, and the result was as follows : of forty-eight patients with chancres in an incipient state, and exactly as they occurred in practice, one half was treated in the manner I have mentioned, by destroy- ing the chancres with caustic immediately on my being desired to see them, while all the others were put under mercury for eight or ten days before the application of caustic. In every other circumstance the method of treat- ment was the same. The difference, however, surprised me exceedingly. Of the twenty-four treated with the immediate application of caustic, twenty were seized with buboes; while only three buboes occurred in an equal number to whom mercury had been previously admin • istered." The subject of the treatment of syphilis has been selected for illustration on account of the large use which has been made of figures in discussing the relative value of the two modes of treatment; and the extract from the works of Benjamin Bell as a proof that, long anterior to any discussions among me- dical men as to the value of the numerical method and the extent to which it might be applied in the solution of medical questions, men of shrewd common sense were driven to the use of numbers, as the natural and only means of solving difficult questions, and set- ting doubtful or disputed [joints at rest. Thus much, by way of introduction, the difference of opinion which prevails as to the value of the numerical method seemed to demand. The numerical or statistical method may be defined as the science which prescribes rules for the bringing together of scattered observ- ations, arranging them in classes, testing their sufficiency in point of number, and deducing from them, when so arranged, average and extreme results, fitted by their very condensa- tion to become standards of comparison and data for reasoning. The numerical method*, so defined and * The term, numerical method, will be used throughout this article in preference to the ■word statistics, or statistical method; for, properly speak- ing, statistics means the science of states (from the German word staat, a state), and is therefore syno- nymous with the terms " political economy," " po- litical science," " social science." The first use of the term statistics has been traced to Achenwal, Professor of History in Gottingen, who, in 1749, published an historical work, in which the phrase scicntia statistica occurs for the first time. The useSTATISTICS. 804 understood, comprises two distinct inquiries, the one relating to the individual facts which form the materials for the calculation of aver- age and extreme values, and the other re- ferring to the averages and extremes them- selves. This natural and convenient division of the subject it is proposed now to adopt. 1. Of facts considered as the elements of sta- tistical inquiries.— Scientific inquiries are con- versant with two orders of facts: — namely, phenomena of varying intensity, and events brought about by a multitude of causes. The first class of facts enters very largely into the science of physiology ; the last class consti- tutes, though not to the exclusion of the first, the mass of the materials by which the prac- tical sciences of medicine and hygiene are built up. As examples of phenomena of varying inten- sity may be cited the pulse and respiration, the temperature of the body, the secretions of the skin, kidneys, and lungs, the evacuations of the bowels, the weight and stature of the body at different ages, and the muscular de- velopment and power of different nations and classes of persons. These phenomena, care- fully observed and recorded by the aid of the watch, the thermometer, the measure, the balance, and other instruments adapted to special purposes, become so many numerical values, having the same relation to the aver- ages deduced from them, as the more simple events expressed in units bear to the mean results for which they furnish the materials. As an example of an event brought about by a multitude of causes may be mentioned the event of death, governed, as to the age at which it occurs, by original strength or pecu- liarity of constitution, good or bad nursing and management in infancy, sex, occupation and habits of life, climate and place of abode, skilful or unskilful treatment in sickness ; in a word, by the varied influences which make one man to differ physically from another. This is an illustration taken from the science of hygiene. The alternative of death or re- covery from a disease induced by a cause or causes of variable intensity in persons of opposite sex and of different ages, with con- stitutions modified by the several agenries just specified, and submitted to different modes of treatment, is an example from the practice of medicine. Physiology furnishes illustrations of the same kind in those func- tions of the body (such as the cutting of the teeth, and the first appearance and cessation of the catatnenia) which are dependent for of numbers as a necessary means of comparison in this work of Achenwal, led men to confound the in- strument with the science. Dufau, in his Traite' de Statistique, incorrectly derives the term statistics from the Latin status. The meaning attached to the words statism and statist, in the writings of poets, essayists, and dramatists, bears out the view just put forward of the proper signification of the term statistics. Mil- ton, for instance, speaks'of " statists and lawyers," and elsewhere uses the term in the sense of a man having political power and influence. Ford also uses the word in this latter sense. South speaks of persons who called our religion statism. the period of their occurrence on peculiarity of constitution determined by the combined action of the influences already adverted to. Between these two orders of facts — phe- nomena of varying intensity, and events brought about by a multitude of causes — there is no other difference but that which is apparent on the face of each, namely, that each individual fact, in the one case, is repre- sented by a variable number, while in the other it is a simple unit. If, for example, we count the pulse of several men at the same age, we shall find that each separate observa- tion gives a different number; but, the event of death or recovery in cases of typhus fever will be recorded as a simple unit. In all other respects the two classes of facts closely re- semble each other; for the number of beats peculiar to the pulse of each individual, is as much the result of the concurrent action of several causes, as the event of death or reco- very from fever. The original and acquired constitution, towards the formation of which so many causes must have conspired, deter- mines the number of the pulse in the one case, and influences the event of the disease in the other. The two classes of facts are also equally fitted to supply the elements for the determination of average and extreme values; for it is obvious that the mean and extreme numbers of the pulse, in males and females respectively, furnish as trustworthy standards of comparison and data for reason- ing, as the average number of men following different occupations who die before any spe- cified period of life, and the greatest age which they respectively attain. From what has been just stated, it will be seen that all the facts which form the mate- rials for our averages, are phenomena or events brought about by the concurrent action of a multitude of causes. The facts or events •with which the physiologist and physician are conversant, are remarkable for the mul- tiplicity of the causes which conspire to pro- duce them. The subject of study is the hu- man frame, with its differences of sex, age, and inherited or acquired constitution, acted upon by the variable influences of climate, oc- cupation, and habits of life, and still further modified in disease by the treatment and re- gimen which may happen to be adopted. In consequence of the number and diversit}' of the influences brought to bear upon it, the human frame presents an object of study only less difficult than the human mind, affected by a like number and variety of moral causes, of which the true nature and force have to be unravelled by multiplied observations on the condition of mankind under different cir- cumstances ; the aggregate of such observ- ations constituting a great part of the science of statistics properly so called, and bearing to the practical science of government the same relation which pathology and therapeutics, based upon large collections of facts, do to the practice of medicine. Now this dependence of the individual facts or events with which physiology and medicine are conversant on the concurrent action of a805 STATISTICS. 3 r 3 multitude of causes, has been urged as an ob- jection to the introduction of the numerical method into the service of those sciences. It is admitted, that the use of numbers and averages by the astronomer who deals with the more simple relations of matter, such as magnitude and relative position, and by the engineer who avails himself of its more simple properties, such as its hardness, tenacity and elasticity, have contributed to make the science of the one perfect, and the art of the other safe ; but it is contended that the use of num- bers cannot be extended beyond such narrow limits with safety or advantage, and that medi- cine and political economy lie beyond these limits. The actual practice of mankind, founded upon an instinctive perception of the necessity of employing figures in the service of the phy- sician and statesman, may be fairly alleged as a sufficient answer to this objection ; but a little consideration will serve to show its futility. In the first place, it is self-evident that the exclusion of figures from the service of medi- cine, does not bring about the disuse of those very facts and events wdiich are objected to as unfit to be employed as statistical or numerical elements. The physician will still persist in stating and recording the results of his expe- rience. He will still assert that he has sometimes observed this symptom in a certain disease, that he has often found that remedy beneficial, that he has almost never known such and such a mode of treatment to fail. Those who con- tend for the use of numbers in medicine, merely insist on the necessity of reducing the sometimes, the often, and the almost never to a more correct and intelligible form of expres- sion ; and they argue that it is utterly incon- sistent to object to the use of facts as mate- rials or elements of numerical propositions, and yet not to censure the use of these same facts as foundations for loose and inaccurate verbal statements. From this dilemma there is obviously no escape. But, though the ob- jection itself is futile, the misgiving of which it is the exaggerated expression is natural and well founded. It cannot excite surprise that the individual facts or events which own so many concurrent causes should be regarded as requiring, on the part of the observer, a greater degree of care in verifying, recording, collecting, and arranging them than would be necessary in the more simple cases already adduced ; and that both the facts themselves, and the numerical expressions in which they are embodied, should be viewed with a pro- portionate degree of distrust. From this mo- derate and reasonable view of the case, no advocate of the numerical method will be found to dissent. On the contrary, he will seek to strengthen it by giving due promi- nence to each separate ground of misgiving, and by laying down stringent rules for the guidance and governance of the observer. Before proceeding to detail some of these rules, it may be well to advert to a probable, and, indeed, obvious cause, of the distrust with which numerical data are sometimes regarded. Indiscreet advocates of the numerical method have sought to apply the general results of collections of cases expressed in the language of figures to the treatment of individual cases of the same disease, without making allowance for those differences between case and case which confessedly existed in the collections themselves. They have used a general prin- ciple, as if it had been a rigid and unbending rule of action; forgetting that though, as the experience of assurance offices abundantly tes- tifies, the general results obtained from a large number of individual facts may be salely re- applied to an aggregate of facts of the same nature, they cannot be brought to bear on a single case, or on a small number of cases, without the greatest danger. Each case must be viewed in practice, first as a generality governed by some large law of prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment; and secondly, as a specialty demanding a careful consideration of all its peculiarities. Among the rules which ought to govern the observer in the collection of facts destined to form the elements of averages, there are some of so simple and obvious a nature as to re- quire no discussion. Such are, the previous preparation of some simple and available form of register, by means of which the several facts may be committed to paper at the very time of observation, so that nothing maybe trusted to the memory ; the careful selection of the facts themselves -r the shaping of the inquiries which may be necessary to elucidate those facts as nearly as may be in the same terms; the avoidance as much as possible of such leading questions as would be likely to bias the respondent, when the facts in question, like most of the particulars which make up the history of diseases, are dependent upon testi- mony ; and especially the purging of the ob- server's own mind of prejudices and precon- ceptions in respect of the subject of inquiry. The careful selection of the facts w hich are to form the materials of our averages is by far the most important of these rules, and one which demands a little further consider- ation. If we consider the facts we are ob- serving in the light of phenomena, or events brought about by a multitude of concurrent causes, it will be obvious that care will re- quire to be exercised, not so much in verify- ing each phenomenon or event as that of which we are in search, as in ascertaining that all the concurrent causes or conditions are, or have been, in operation to bring about that phenomenon or event. The absence of a single cause or condition will vitiate the in- dividual fact, and impair or destroy the value of our average results. A few illustrations will suffice to show what is here intended. We are anxious to determine the true average frequency of the pulse in adult males, in a state of rest, and as free as possible from the influence of all disturbing causes ; but, either from ignorance or oversight, we count it in- differently in every position of the body, and at all times of the day. In this case, our facts cease to be comparable facts ; for it is wellSTATISTICS. 806 known, that both posture and time of day have a remarkable influence on the number of the pulse. Or, to take another case, we wish to ascertain the influence of some employment upon health (say that of the letter-press printer) ; but we overlook the important fact, that in every printing office, two or three very distinct occupations are carried on, of which the most important are those of the com- positor and pressman. Not being fully aware of this fact, and of the wide difference exist- ing between the two employments, we pro- ceed to extract from some mortuary register the ages at death of printers as a class, calcu- late the average age at death, and then proceed to group the whole class of printers with that large class of occupations carried on in-doors, with little bodily exertion, to which the com- positor alone properly belongs, but from which the pressman is, by the nature of his employment, excluded. In this case, we should have been misled by the common name borne by men following two really dis- tinct occupations, and our facts would again cease to be comparable facts. A third and apt illustration is afforded by the Asiatic cholera. We wish to compare two different remedies or plans of treatment ; but we administer the one remedy, or adopt the one plan, at the onset of the epidemic, and the other during its decline. Here, again, our facts are not comparable facts ; for it is one of the well- known characteristics of this disease, that it is more severe on its first occurrence than during the period of its decline. The same sort of error would be committed, if one remedy were administered in an early, and the other in an advanced, stage of the attacks themselves. The principle which these illus- trations are intended to enforce, is the ne- cessity of selecting, as the elements of the same average, facts strictly comparable, or, in other words, brought about by the same com- bination of causes. Over the intensity with which each cause acts in individual instances, the observer can exercise no control. His province is to ascertain that the same com- bination of causes is at work to bring about each phenomenon or event. If from ignor- ance or oversight he fails in this duty, he im- pairs the value of his facts, and vitiates his inferences in proportion to the number and force of the conditions that he has overlooked or omitted. In the observation and collection, therefore, of the individual phenomena or events which are to serve as materials for our average re- sults, the first precaution to be observed is, that those phenomena or events should be strictly comparable as regards the combination of causes by which they are brought about; or, as the French statists express it, we must ensure " I'invamabvlite de I'ensemble des causes possibles." The frequent omission of this most necessary precaution has given birth to the dogma of Morgagni — Non numerandec sed pcr- vendendec sunt observationcs — and to the most valid objections urged against the applica- tion of the numerical method in medicine. For the collection, arrangement, and classifi- cation of the facts which are to form the ma- terials of our averages, no concise rules can be laid down. The tabular forms must adapt themselves to the exigencies of each individual inquiry ; and must be more or less comply cated as the subjects of investigation con- sist of few or many particulars. In reporting cases, for instance, and in collecting and analyzing those recorded by others, tabular forms embracing many particulars are re- quired ; and the preparation of such forms demands unusual skill and care.* The same remarks apply to the collection and classifi- cation of recorded experiences and opinions bearing on particular subjects of inquiry \ ; a numerical summary of authorities favourable and adverse to particular doctrines, consti- tuting what may be not inaptly termed the statistics of opinion. 2. Of the average and extreme results de- duced from observation. — The observer having exercised all due care in the observation of his facts, having grouped together only those events which owned the same combination of antecedents or causes ; and having further correctly performed the work of enumeration, has thus obtained certain average and extreme results, which are to constitute standards of comparison and data for reasoning ; the question naturally arises — are these average and extreme results sound and trustworthy standards and data, or not ; and what are the circumstances which render them the one or the other ? Common sense and experience combine to give an authoritative answer to this question. Our average and extreme re- sults are more or less sound and trustworthy, as the individual facts from which they have been calculated are more or less numerous. Where the facts upon which it is attempted to found a general principle, or to establish a standard of comparison, are very few, we are at once conscious of their insufficiency ; and the more readily when an attempt is made to apply the principle or standard in question to some important practical purpose. A better illus- tration of the futility of such an attempt can scarcely be found than the well-known test of Ploucquet. That author proposed to deter- mine whether or not a child was still-born by referring every doubtful case to a standard of comparison, founded upon three observ- * On this subject the late Dr. Todd, of Brighton, has written a very able work, which may be safely recommended to all who desire to' enter upon such complicated investigations.

Though Ploucquet, in this procedure, offended against two of the most obvious statistical rules, his test con- tinued to be treated with undeserved respect, till comparatively recent investigations on a larger scale had demonstrated the little re- liance to be placed upon it. The most common attention to the ordinary daily occurrences of life would suffice to caution us against such errors as that into which Ploucquet fell. Coincidences of the most startling character are constantly happening to put us on our guard against them. One which occurred to the writer of this article deserves to be put on record. Two cases of congenital absence of the larger pectoral muscle on the same side of the body, oc- curred, on the same day, among the out- patients of the King's College Hospital. This defect he has never happened to observe within the wards of that Hospital or else- where, either before or since. A similar coincidence, though of a less striking cha- racter, presented itself in the same institution while the writer was noticing with some care and interest the complexion and physiognomy of patients suffering from pulmonary consump- tion. His own previous experience, in con- formity with the general opinion, had pointed out the fair complexion as that of the great majority of phthisical patients ; but the almost exclusive occurrence for several days together of the olive complexion, among patients labouring under that disease, had almost led him to discard his former opinion anil that of the best authorities, and to embrace one which, as farther observation convinced him, would have been erroneous. Games of chance are constantly furnishing striking examples of these coincidences, in the shape of what is familiarly known as a run of good or ill-luck ; the same event, favourable or unfavourable, occurring many times in suc- cession, contrary not only to reasonable ex- pectation, but to the results of unerring cal- culation. On the other band, the success of the bank, with only a slight calculated chance in its favour, but with a capital sufficiently large to await the inevitable change in the run of luck, vindicates the sufficiency of large numbers of facts. The great annual fluctu- ations, too, which take place in the balance of the receipts and expenditure of assurance offices, but the ultimate safety of their trans- actions, when extending over a long term of years and embracing a large number of in- surances, serve to enforce the same truth. The sufficiency for all practical purposes of large numbers of facts, may also be inferred from the remarkable uniformity observed to take place in the annual summaries of events brought about by the continued operation of the same combination of causes. The annual reports of the Registrar-General supply many illustrations of this principle. The illustration best suited to our present purpose, is one drawn from an event removed, by the very nature of the case, beyond the reach of ex- ternal influences, or only very remotely and indirectly amenable to them ; namely, the proportion of male and female births in suc- cessive years. In the eighth annual report of the Registrar-General (p. lxi.), a table is given, in which the number of males and females born, to every hundred living males and females respectively, is recorded for the seven years 1839-45. If we substitute 100,000 for 100, the table will read thus. Year. Males. Females. Exce?s of Males. 1839 6,498 6,211 287 1840 6,539 6,250 289 1841 6,580 6,289 291 1842 6,564 6,273 291 1843 6,597 6,305 292 1844 6,676 6,381 295 1845 6,622 6,329 293 The largest excess of male over female births, therefore, in these seven years is 295, and the least 287, the average being 291 ; so that the extreme fluctuation amounts to only 8 births in about 6500, or considerably less than 1 in 800; while the excess or defect above or below the average of 291 is only 4 births, or less than 1 in 1600. If the causes which determine the births of males and females re- spectively could be assumed to be constant and uniform, these fractional fluctuations would express the divergences due to the insufficiency of the number of observations to express an absolutely true result. The close approximation actually obtained must be held to prove the sufficiency for every prac- tical purpose of results based upon large numbers of observations. Having thus shown, by two opposite ex- amples, the total insufficiency of small num- bers of facts, and the sufficiency, at least for practical purposes, of large numbers of ob- servations, it will be necessary to enter into a more detailed examination of the relative value of numbers of observations intermediate between these two extremes. From what has been already stated, it must be obvious that the degree of confidence to be reposed in results based upon different collections of facts must vary with the num- ber of those facts ; and that, other things being equal, the value of the results must increase with every addition made to that number. But it is only by actual observation, or by mathematical calculations based upon indisputable data, that the precise value of any particular number of facts can be deter- mined. Observation, indeed, is altogether unequal to give more than a vague and general idea of the relative values of small and large collections of facts ; so that we must ulti- mately resort to the mathematics both for authoritative decisions and safe guides. As, however, the large majority of mankind is destitute of that mathematical knowledge andSTATISTICS. 808 training which is essential to the appreciation of mathematical rules, it is desirable to show, by an appeal to the results of actual observ- ation, the increasing value of increasing col- lections of facts, as well as the rate of that increase. For this purpose, it is proposed to make use of some observations collected by the writer of this article. Having had occa- sion, a few years since, to bring together, from the pages of the Peerage and Baronetage, the ages at death of the male members of the En- glish aristocracy, dying 21 years and upwards, to the number of several hundreds, it ap- peared to be a favourable opportunity of test- ing the relative values of large and small numbers of facts, as well as of obtaining a rude approximation to a rule or measure of value. The ages at death, relating, as they do, to members of the same class in society, and taken without selection from the successive obituaries of noble families, constitute a col- lection of strictly comparable facts, well suited to the purpose in view. The following table, which embodies the results of these facts in their bearing on the question before us, has been formed in the following manner : — The several facts were first arranged in groups of 25 each; two successive groups of 25 were then formed into groups of 50 ; the groups of 50, in like manner, into groups of 100, and so on, till the last totals in the table were ob- tained. The greatest and least averages ob- tained from each group of facts were then selected, and, with the range, or difference be- tween them, thrown into a tabular form. Average Age at Death. Number of Facts. Max. Min. Eange. 25 69-40 50-64 18-76 50 66-44 55-20 11-24 100 63-70 56-85 6-85 200 62-38 57-61 4-77 400 61-10 58-24 2-86 800 60-84 59-67 1-17 1600 60-25 Now; if we assume the true average duration of life among the members of the Peerage and Baronetage, who have attained their 21st year to extend to 60 years (being the mean of 1600 observations), and, for the sake of simplicity, substitute for the decimals in the table the whole numbers nearest to them in magnitude, it will follow that, in making use of the several groups of observations specified Number of Error in Excess Facts. or Defect. 25 9',- 50 5i 100 3| 200 2^ 400 li 800 0i in the first column of the annexed table, we may have the errors in excess or in defect which are enumerated in the second column. These figures, then, represent the extreme error which could have been committed, in this particular case, by relying on 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 facts respectively. But it must be borne in mind, that this collection of facts is one which, from the very nature of the case, is likely to present a minimum of divergence between the averages deduced from the same number of facts ; for the several obituaries, from which the ages at death are taken, register the deaths of one and the same class, inhabitants of the same country, and split into family groups bearing a close re- semblance to each other. If, instead of a single class, exposed to similar influences, and not admitting of subdivision into smaller classes, we were to take the members of that large section of the community which is ge- nerally known as the upper and middle class, with their numerous subdivisions of employ- ment, and class them by fifties and hundreds, we should encounter a much more consider- able divergence. The results of such a com- parison for the class in question are embodied in the following table. Average Age at Death. Number of Facts. Max. Mm. Eange. 50 84-44 56-78 27-66 100 76-24 58-25 17-99 200 73-54 61-50 12-04 400 69-78 63-51 6-27 800 68-67 65-07 3-60 1600 67-93 64-84 3-09 3200 66-38 65-82 0-56 6400 66-10 If, as in the former case, we take 66 years to be the true average age attained by the entire middle class, reckoning from 21 years of age, and reduce the range in each case to the nearest whole number, we shall have the following divergences. Number of Error in Excess Facts. or Defect. 50 14 100 9 200 6 400 3 800 2 1600 H 3200 0i In this instance, therefore, though we begin with 50 in place of 25 facts, we obtain a possible error in excess or defect of 14 years in place of 9| years. It must be obvious, then, that the errors to which averages de- duced from any given number of facts are liable, will vary with the nafure of those facts ; and that the extent of possible error will bear809 STATISTICS. a certain proportion to the number of the influences which are brought to bear on each unit of each collection of facts. It must not, however, be forgotten that the figures in these several tables represent only possible errors. It may happen that the first 25 observations brought together may yield an average differing by less than a single unit from the mean of thousands of observations ; and there is always a balance of probability in favour of the average even of a small num- ber of facts approximating more closely to the true average than to the extremes. That this is the case will be evident on the most cursory inspection of the following tables, of which the first is founded upon the facts Average Age at Death. 25 Facts. 72 Groups. 50 Facts. 36 Groups, 1 uu l acts. 18 Groups. 2UU racts. 9 Groups. 400 racts. 4 Groups. 800 Facts. 2 Groups. 69 1 68 U 07 u 66 n s 1 65 A t u 64 r\ V I 63 3 3 1 62 3 5 3 3 61 9 6 3 0 3 1 60 9 4 3 2 0 1 59 8 5 3 3 0 58 6 5 1 1 1 57 5 1 3 56 6 3 55 1 1 54 3 53 1 52 0 51 1 Average Age 50 Facts. 100 Facts. 200 Facts. 400 Facts. 800 Facts. 1600 Facts. 3200 Facts. at Death. 128 Groups. 64 Groups. 32 Groups. 10 Groups. 8 Groups. 4 Groups. 2 Groups. 84 1 83 0 82 0 81 0 80 0 79 0 78 0 77 0 76 1 1 75 1 0 74 4 1 1 73 2 1 0 72 2 1 0 71 5 0 0 70 4 4 0 1 69 7 3 2 0 1 68 13 5 3 1 0 1 67 17 9 4 4 1 0 mm 20 13 14 4 2 1 2 65 5 13 2 4 3 2 64 16 6 2 2 1 63 11 1 2 62 10 4 1 61 - 3 1 1 60 3 0 59 0 0 58 0 1 57 3STATISTICS. 810 relating to the duration of life of the aristo- cracy, and the second on the facts relating to the duration of life of the combined upper and middle classes. For the sake of per- spicuity, the average of all the facts in either table is distinguished by a larger type. These tables speak for themselves. In the first table, for instance, the small number of 25 facts is seen to yield the same average as the total of 1800 facts in no less than 9 in- stances, or one eighth of the whole number ; while in 26 out of 72 instances, or more than one third, the average of 25 facts exceeds or falls short of the average of 1800 facts by only a single unit. In like manner, it ap- pears from the second table, that in 20 cases out of 128, or little less than one sixth, the average of 50 facts coincides with that of 6400 facts; and that in 42 out of 128, or nearly one third, it differs from it only by a single unit. Without entering into a minute examination of the other columns of the two tables, it will suffice to state that the proba- bility in favour of an average of a given num- ber of observations coinciding with the true average increases with the number of observ- ations ; so that we are again brought back to the expediency of collecting large numbers of observations wherever it is practicable so to do. In using small numbers of facts to establish data for reasoning or standards of comparison, we are bound to speak with dif- fidence of their sufficiency, and we ought to regard them rather in the light of probabilities requiring to be strengthened by other pro- babilities, as weak arguments require to be supported by additional reasons, than as, in themselves, worthy of great reliance. Ac- cording to this view of the case, we are not precluded from the use of averages drawn from small numbers of facts. The employ- ment of such averages with this proviso is an absolute scientific necessity; for in many in- stances we are prevented by causes too nu- merous to specify from bringing together facts by the hundred or the thousand, and yet, were we to reject the smaller numbers as in- admissible, we should be thrown back upon the still more loose and less trustworthy general statements from which it is the pro- vince of statistics to rescue us. An examination of the two foregoing tables, as well as of those which display the extreme variations between the averages derived from the same numbers of facts, will serve to prove the hopelessness of any attempt to establish by observation rules for measuring the rela- tive value of averages derived from different numbers of facts. It must be equally evident that no deductions drawn from observation can enable us to state the actual liability to error of any given number of facts, considered as facts, without reference to their peculiar nature. To determine this liability to error belongs solely to the mathematics. If, on the one hand, observation is unable to supply us with the means of testing the true liability to error of conclusions based on a given number of facts, considered as facts, without reference to their peculiar nature, it must be evident, on the other hand, that ma- thematical formulas deduced from abstract reasoning can only supply us with the means of measuring the value of a given number of facts in this their abstract relation, without taking into account the varying quality of the facts themselves. But as it is of the utmost importance to be able to test the abstract sufficiency of a given number of facts to establish a principle or to supply a sound standard of comparison, it will be necessary to enter at some length into this part of our subject. The facts already adduced, must have abundantly shown that the limits of deviation from a true average result are wider or nar- rower as the number of facts from which the average is drawn is smaller or greater. Many eminent mathematicians, and M. Poisson among the number, have laboured to convert this general principle into an exact numerical' expression or formula, applicable as a test of the true value of larger or smaller collections of facts, and as an exact measure of the limits of variation. M. Gavarret, in his work on Medical Statistics, contends successfully for the introduction of these formulae into the service of the medical man ; and adopting the sentiment of Laplace, " Le systeme tout entier des connaissances humaines se rattache a, la theorie des probabilites," he insists that medical statistics, or, as we prefer to term it, the Numerical Method, applied to medicine, is nothing more nor less than a special appli- cation of the Calculus of Probabilities, and the Theory of large Numbers ; and that as such it is the most indispensable complement of the experimental method. In other words, he deems it incumbent on the medical man to apply to his numerical results the corrections supplied by the formulae of the pure mathe- matics ; and before he concludes that any number actually obtained by observation is a true representative of a fact or law, to deter- mine whether that number may not be com- prised within the limits of possible variation. M. Gavarret illustrates the necessity of this precaution by applying his mathematical for- mulae to a great variety of results based upon observation; but he especially insists upon bringing the alleged efficacy of certain modes of treatment to this searching test. The most convenient course to adopt, in reference to these formulae, will be to present the calcula- tions based upon them in tabular forms, and then to apply these calculations to one or two striking examples. The following table presents at one view the possible errors corresponding to average mortalities deduced from different numbers of observations. It is obvious that the table is equally applicable to other contingencies of the same kind, where one of two events is possible in every instance. The mode of using it will be presently explained and illus- trated.811 STATISTICS.

Let us suppose that a me- dical man, having, for a long time, adopted a particular course of treatment in a certain malady, has arrived at the following results : 120 deaths, G80 recoveries, 800 cases. The average mortality in this case would * This table is an abbreviation of one given at p. 142. of Gavarret's work, but with additional cal- culations based on the same formula, for the numbers from 25 to 200 inclusive. The formula from which the iigures in the column of possible errors have been calculated is, y2.tn.ii in which m represents the number of times that an event A has happened, n the number of times that an event b has happened, and jj. the total number of events : so that m + n = ft; ™ the average fre- rjuency of the events ;n,as obtained by observation ; and m + /2.m.n an(j v /2 .m .n the limits within which the true average,as corrected by the formula, lies. he or 0-150000 (see the second column of the table for 800 facts and 120 deaths). At first sight the medical observer would ap- pear to be justified in asserting that under his method of treatment the mortality was at the rate of only 150,000 in 1,000,000 patients, or 15 per cent. But this assertion would be immediately met by the objection that the number of facts is not sufficient to justify this statement, that an average deduced from so small a number as 800 facts can only be re- ceived as an approximation to the truth, and that it requires to be corrected by the aid of the figures in the table. Accordingly, on referring to the column of possible errors corresponding to 800 cases and 120 deaths, we find that the error in ex- cess and defect to which this number of facts is liable, amounts to 0-035707, which error must be added to and taken from the 0-150000, the result of actual observation. It follows, therefore, that the true result must be somewhere between the numbers 0-150000 added to 0-035707, or 0-185707, and 0 150000 dim. by 0-035707, or 0-114293.812 STATISTICS. So that instead of asserting, as we should seem justified in doing, that the mortality under the influence of the treatment adopted amounted to 15 per cent., we could only claim a mortality comprised between the numbers 185,707 and 114,293 in 1,000,000 cases: or approximatively between the numbers, 19 and 1 1 per cent. Uncorrected observation, therefore, would give, as the result of the treatment adoptetl, 15 per cent., while corrected observation would give some number between 19 and 11 per cent. The application of the formula given in the note to an actual case will be more instruc- tive than an imaginary example. M. Louis, in his Recherckes sar la Fievre Typho'idc, has attempted to illustrate the treat- ment of typhus fever, by minutely analysing 140 cases. The result was as follows : — Number of deaths (m) 52 Number of recoveries 88 Total - O) 140. The mortality in these cases was therefore t%j or 0 37143 ; and if we were to take this mortality as the strict expression of the re- sults of the treatment adopted, we should shape our proposition as follows : — The mor- tality of typhus fever, under the treatment adopted by M. Louis, amounted to 37,143 deaths in 100,000 patients ; or, in round numbers, 37 deaths in 100 patients If, now, we proceed by means of the formula referred to, to determine the possible error at- taching to this proposition (i. e. to the num- ber of facts upon which it is made to rest), we finct it to be equal to 2 / 2 . m . n 2 / 2 . 52 . 88 {/ = \f ThoT^ = °'11530- This being the possible error in excess and defect, the true influence of the treat- ment will be comprised between the following limits: — vi 2 / 2 vt ?? -+ / -^=0-37143 + 0-11550=0-48093 and m 2 /2.m.n — . / —=0-37143—0-11550=0-25593. h V M Thus all that we really learn from this re- cord of experience is, that, under the treat- ment adopted, the number of deaths may vary between 48,693 and 25,593 in 100,000 patients, or approximatively between 49 and 26 in 100 patients. In other words, if we were to employ the same mode of treatment in a great number of cases of typhus fever, we might lose any number between about a fourth and a half of our patients.* The same formula is equally applicable to the solution of doubtful questions relative to the results of two or more series of facts which * Gavavrct, Prineipes Ge"ne'raux ile Statistiquc Me'dicale, p. 284. we are desirous of comparing. It may happen that the difference between the average result of one series of facts and that of a second series, is so inconsiderable, as to leave us in doubt whether it may not be explained by a reference to the limits of error to which the number of facts in either return is liable.* It often happens, that the average results of two series of observations relating to two alternative events (such as the events of death or recovery in particular diseases, the birth of a male or female child, &c.) approxi- mate so closely, that we are at a loss whether to attribute the slight difference existing be- tween the two averages to coincidence, or to the operation of certain efficient causes. If the number of observed facts be small, the difference between the averages derived from the two series of facts may be so slight as to fall short of the difference between the limits of error in excess or defect. The same re- sult may also happen with any number of facts, however considerable. In order to solve the doubts which necessarily attach to such close approximations, a mathematical formula has been brought into requisition, and employed in the formation of tables ap- plicable to this purpose. Such a table is subjoined. The mode of applying it will be presently explained. The use of this table will be understood from the following example : — In the six years 1839-44 there occurred in England, on the average of those years, 515,478 births, of which 264,245 were males, and 251,233 fe- males. As the difference between these two numbers is not very considerable, a question might arise, whether that difference is not compatible with the error in excess to which half a million of facts is liable. The use of the formula on which the foregoing table is founded, would at once clear up this doubt. 264,245 male births in a total of 515,478, is equal to 512,904 male births in 1,000,000 births. But, on the supposition that the male and female births are really equal in number, we have the limits of variation equal to 500,000 + A /— and 500,000—A /- , 2,„^ A/ 515478 A/ 515478, or 500,0004 000,624 and 500,000—000,624, or a maximum of 500,624, and a minimum of 499,376. The difference by the formula is, therefore, 1248 in the million, while the ob- served difference between the highest and lowest number of male births occurring in the six years 1839-44, is 514,809—511,781, or 3,028. The inference, therefore, is irresist- ible, that the excess of male births is due to some efficient cause or causes, and that it is not merely an error to which the number of half a million of facts is inevitably exposed.f * For illustrations of this application of the fore- going table, and of the formula fromwhich the figures are calculated, see Gavarret's Statistique Me'dicale, p. 80. et scq., and notes, p. 274. t Several applications of this table and of the formula from which the figures are derived, will be813 STATISTICS.

In the absence of tables specially adapted to this purpose, it must found in the work of Gavarret, so often quoted, from p. 143. onwards, and in the notes at p. 28G. et seq. * The formula employed in the construction of this table is where ", as before, represents the total of the ob- served facts. The table will be found at greater length at p. 230 of Gavarret's work on Medical Statistics. suffice to state, in general terms, that the averages derived from a given number of facts are not to be regarded as strict expressions of the truth, but as approximations more or less remote, as the number of facts is less or more considerable. But a very important question here arises : — To what extent, and under what restric- tions, do calculations based on mathematical formula; and derived from abstract reasoning, admit of application to the results of actual observation ? Conceding, as we may safely do, the soundness of the formula?, there is yet great room to doubt the propriety of then- application to the average results of observa- tion. For if we suppose a mathematical formula to be applied successively to a long series of averages derived from the same number of facts, it must obviously administer a similar correction to those averages which happen to coincide with the true average, and to those which lie at the two extremes. This consideration is sufficient in itself to condemn the use of mathematical formula;, except as a means of exhibiting in a striking light the possible error attaching to a small number of facts, considered abstractedly as facts. From the foregoing considerations, then, it would seem to follow, that although averages derived from small numbers of facts are sub- ject to a considerable amount of possible error, there is always such a probability of their coinciding with, or not differing widely from, the true averages, as to justify their employ- ment as standards of comparison and data for reasoning. At the same time it must be con- ceded, that averages derived from small num- bers of facts stand in need of a confirmation which averages drawn from larger numbers of facts do not require, and that in using the former we are bound to speak with a reserve proportioned to the scantiness of our ma- terials. Of extreme values derived from observation. ■— As averages founded upon large numbers of facts are numerical expressions of true pro- babilities, so extreme values are expressions, in the same precise language, of possibilities. Both orders of facts have their scientific ami practical applications ; but those applications which belong to the extreme values have been less attended to than those which pertain to averages. One obvious use of extreme values is to confirm and strengthen the conclusions drawn from averages. Thus, if we wish to ascertain the relative duration of life of two classes of persons, we may make use of the greatest age attained by either class in confirmation of the mean of all the observations ; ami the coincidence of the one with the other will give increased confidence in the general result. Another important use of extreme values is as a test of numerical theories. Two apt il- lustrations of this application of figures are afforded by that practical science which deals most largely in possibilities — Forensic Medi- cine. M. Orfila, in his " Traile des Exhuma- tions," states that it is possible to determine814 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. approximative^ the stature of the skeleton and of the body by measuring one of the cy- lindrical bones; but instead of testing the value of this conclusion by making use of the extreme values, he contents himself with a rough average. It appears, however, that if we take several cylindrical bones having the same length, and compare them with the cor- responding ascertained stature of the skeleton, the extreme statures are very wide apart. Of seven ulnas, for instance, having each the same length (viz. 10 inches, 8 lines), one cor- responded to a stature of G feet 1£ inch, and another to a stature of only 5 feet 5 inches. The difference of 8£ inches shows the possible error which might be committed by trusting to this standard of comparison, and demonstrates its futility. The other illustration is afforded by the well-known test of the absolute weight of the foetal lungs. It used to be laid down as a rough average that in still-born mature chil- dren the weight of the lungs was one ounce, and in children that were born alive two ounces. More accurate observation showed that this rough guess was very far from the truth. It was only, however, by the aid of extreme values that the utter worthlessness of this test could be proved. It resulted from the collation of a moderate number of ob- servations that the lowest weight before and after respiration were the same to an unit, while the greatest weight of the lungs of still- born children, in two instances, surpassed the greatest weight of the lungs of children born alive. Nothing could more clearly demon- strate the insufficiency and invalidity of this test. The same general principle which applies to averages applies also to the extremes, namely, that the value of the extremes in- creases with the number of observations from which they are selected. It is obvious, how- ever, that a larger number of facts will be re- quired to arrive at a true extreme value than to obtain a close approximation to the true mean : 10,000 facts, for instance, may give a true mean duration of life for the inhabitants of any country ; but as many millions may not happen to embrace the greatest attainable age. The same principles, then, apply both to the mean and to the extreme values derived from observation. To obtain a correct mean or a probable extreme, we must multiply our facts.

SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES {Arterice subclavice, Lat. ; Arteres sous-clavieres, Fr. ; die Schliisselbein Pulsadern, Germ.). — These arteries, two in number, are the great vessels destined to supply the upper extremities with blood. Each passes to the corresponding ex- tremity as a continuous trunk, which in its coursegives off numerous collateral branches to the larynx, neck, nervous centres, thorax, &c. The subclavian arteries on the right and left sides respectively differ from each other in their origin, length, direction, and in their relations to surrounding parts, — differences, however, which occur in the first stage of these vessels only : thus, on the right side, the subclavian artery is derived from the Arteria innominata, and on the left from the arch of the aorta ; but on both sides alike the lower or outer margin of the first rib marks the termination of each vessel, which, in its further course towards the upper extremity, is designated by the name of Axillary. The course of each subclavian artery may, in general terms, be described as representing an arch, the convexity of which looks upwards towards the neck, whilst the concavity has an aspect downwards, and corresponds closely to the apex of the lung. On the right side the extremities of this arch are nearly on the same level, the outer, however, passing a little lower down than the inner; whilst on the left side the reverse obtains, the inner (or cardiac) extremity of the arch of the left subclavian artery, which springs from the aorta, being on a much lower level than the outer. Owing to the difference in the origin of these vessels, the left subclavian artery has a stage within the thorax, which does not belong to the artery of the right side. The subclavian artery on each side is ac- companied by a vein of large size; the direction of the vein is much more transverse than that of the artery, so as to resemble in some respect, as Cruveilhier expresses it, " the cord of the arc which the artery describes:" the subclavian vein is consequently the shorter vessel of the two. The course of each subclavian artery may be divided into three stages, to which the ma- jority of anatomists agree in assigning the following limits : — A first stage comprises that portion of the vessel, from its origin, to the inner, or tracheal edge, of the scalenus anticus muscle. A second stage includes so much of the artery as is contained between the sca- leni muscles ; and the Third stage extends from the acromial edge of the scalenus anticus muscle to the lower or outer margin of the first rib : at this latter point the axillary artery commences. According to some anatomists (as Bichat), the outer margin of the scaleni muscles is the limit between the subclavian and axillarySUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 815 vessels; others (as Cruveilhier) insist upon the clavicle as the line of demarcation between these two great trunks ; but the stages above assigned to the subclavian arteries are strictly in accordance with the views of British ana- tomical authorities. The subclavian vein may be divided into tivo stages, which correspond to the second and third stages of the artery ; at the inner edge of the scalenus anticus muscle on each side of the neck, the subclavian joins the in- ternal jugular vein to form the vena inno- minata (of Meckel), which latter vein conse- quently coiresponds to the first stage of the subclavian artery. As the right and left subclavian arteries differ from each other essentially in their first stage, it is necessary to describe them sepa- rately in this portion of their course. First stage of the right subclavian artery. — This portion of the vessel varies from one to two inches in length ; it extends from the summit of the arteria innominata to the tra- cheal edge of the anterior scalenus muscle, and passes in a direction outwards, and slightly upwards. At its commencement it lies to the right of the trachea, and is concealed by the sterno-clavicular articulation. In this stage the artery is contained in the antero-inferior triangle of the neck. The fol- lowing structures here constitute its anterior relations, and are described in the order in which they present themselves in dissection : — The skin, and subcutaneous cellular stra- tum, with one sheet of the cervical fascia, being divided, the tendon of the sterno-mas- toid muscle (sternal origin) is exposed : be- hind it is a cellular interval of constant ex- istence, though of variable extent, where anastomosing veins and small arterial twigs ramify. The outer edges of the sterno-hyoid and of the sterno-thyroid muscles are more deeply placed ; the latter extends much fur- ther outwards than the former, and hence it more directly overhangs and conceals the subclavian artery. These muscles are con- tained in distinct sheaths (furnished by the deep cervical fascia), which isolate them, as well from the superficial as from the deeper- seated parts : the layer of l'ascia which forms the back of the sheath of the sterno-thyroid muscle is the deepest lamina of the cervical aponeurosis; towards the middle line it in- vests the front of the trachea, and the deep thyroid veins; externally,it covers the carotid and subclavian arteries, with their accompany- ing veins, and is connected, to the scalenus anticus muscle, whilst, interiorly, it is attached to the clavicle, to the sternum, and to the " thoracico-cervical septum," through the in- tervention of which it is connected with the fibrous layer of the pericardium. On the removal of this fascia from the region under consideration, the immediate anterior relations of the subclavian artery are exhibited ; they are as follow : — a. The right vena innominata, its satellite vein, lies anterior to the artery in the first stage of its course, but on a lower plane, and separated from it by the phrenic and vagus nerves, and by the internal mammary artery. b. The internal jugular vein, which passes downwards and outwards into the subclavian vein, in order to form with it the right vena innominata, crosses the front of the artery nearly at right angles : an interval (the result of the inclination outwards of the internal jugular vein) occurs between this vein and the common carotid artery ; and here c. The vagus nerve passes over the sub- clavian artery ; whilst internal to this point the subclavian artery is enveloped in a. nervous sheath, formed of d. The cardiac filaments of the sympathetic nerve.* e. Lastly, the phrenic nerve constitutes an important anterior relation of the subclavian artery, passing anterior to the very last por- tion of the first stage of the vessel, though not in contact with it. The trajet of the nerve is external to that of the internal jugular vein, which, as before mentioned, crosses the same aspect of the artery. There is no actual contact between the phrenic nerve and the subclavian artery, because the nerve, as it leaves the inner margin of the scalenus an- ticus muscle, lies on and crosses the origin of the mammary artery, which thus separates the nerve in question from the trunk of the subclavian. The relation of f The vertebral vein, to the subclavian ar- tery, is subject to much variety. According to the descriptions of most anatomists, it passes posterior to the artery; but the writer has found this vein nearly as often in front of the artery as behind it; and occasionally he has seen the vertebral vein terminate in two branches, of which one passed on the anterior, and the other on the posterior aspect of the subclavian artery, so as to encircle that vessel before they opened into the vena innominata. When the vertebral vein is single, and passes over the front of the subclavian artery, it usually lies internal and parallel to the in- ternal jugular vein. The anterior relations of the first stage of the right subclavian artery, are, therefore, the fol- lowing : — 1. Integument, subcutaneous areolar tissue, fascia. 2. Sterno-mastoid muscle, sterno-clavi- cular articulation. 3. Sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, iso- lated from one another, and from the last-named muscle, by layers of the cervical fascia. 4. The deep layer of the cervical aponeurosis. 5. The phrenic and vagus nerves, and the cardiac filaments of the sympathetic nerve. G. The right innominate, and internal jugu- lar veins, and sometimes 7. The vertebral vein. The remaining relations of the artery in its first stage are the following: — Infcriorly, it corresponds to the loop of the * Vide art. Neck, vol. iii. note to p. 575.SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 816 recurrent nerve, which sometimes has an an- terior relation to the artery also, in consequence of its arising from the pneumogastric at an unusual height in the neck. Superiorly■, it gives off the vertebral artery opposite a triangular interval, between the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles. Posteriorly, it corresponds from within out- wards, to the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, to the inferior cardiac fila- ments and inferior cervical ganglion, of the sympathetic nerve, to the recurrent nerve, and finally, to the cone of the pleura. Nearly the outer half of the posterior sur- face of this portion of the subclavian artery is thus closely related to this serous sac, being usually that part of the vessel which is ex- ternal to the origin of the vertebral branch, and covered on its anterior surface by the internal jugular vein. First stage of the left subclavian artery. — The subclavian artery on the left side arises within the thorax, from the termination of the second stage of the arch of the aorta, at the level of the second dorsal vertebra ; it thence assumes a direction nearly vertically upwards, to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus muscle, and lies to the left side of, and anterior to, the two upper dorsal vertebrae, from which it is but a short way distant. Whilst in the cavity of the thorax, the left subclavian artery corresponds, posteriorly, to the inferior cervical ganglion, and cord of the sympathetic nerve, to the thoracic duct, and more remotely to the longus colli muscle and spinal column. Anteriorly, it is in relation with the pleura, and more immediately with the left pneumogastric and phrenic nerves (the latter descends parallel to the artery, but the former crosses it very obliquely, from above down- wards anil inwards), with the vertebral vein, the confluence of the internal jugular and left subclavian veins, and the great venous trunk which they form by their confluence, viz. the left vena innominata. Internal and 2)osterior to the artery are placed the oesopha- gus and the left recurrent nerve ; internal and anterior to it, is the left common carotid artery ; whilst external to the artery, through- out the entire of its thoracic stage, are the left lung and pleura. After a course within the thorax of about two inches and a half, the left subclavian artery pierces the "thoracico-cervical se ptum," inclines outwards and a little forwards, and attains the tracheal edge of the scalenus anti- cus muscle, when it bends abruptly outwards ; this terminating portion of the first stage of the vessel (which alone belongs to the cervi- cal region) has, anterior to it, the left internal jugular vein, the vagus and phrenic nerves, and the thoracic duct, just before its termina- tion in the great subclavian vein ; in addition to these relations, the left subclavian has the same coverings as the corresponding portion of the subclavian artery on the right side. Differences between the right and the left subclavian arteries, in their first d age.—Length. The first stage of the left subclavian artery is much longer than that of the right, which it exceeds by about the length of the Arteria innominata. In the old subject, however, the difference is scarcely so great, for at this period of life, the part of the arch of the aorta, from which the left subclavian artery arises, is higher than that portion of it from which the innominata springs. Position. — The left subclavian artery is nearer to the spinal column, the right to the clavicle and sternum ; consequently the depth of the artery from the surface is considerably greater on the left side than on the right, a circumstance which adds greatly to the diffi- culty of the operation for securing the left subclavian artery in a ligature. Direction.—On the left side, the artery in its first stage runs almost vertically, but as it approaches the scaleni, it inclines outwards and forwards, in order to pass between these muscles; this latter part of the vessel is situ- ated in the neck, and is the only portion of its first stage found there. On the right side, the subclavian artery runs nearly horizontally outwards, and is placed throughout the whole of its first stage within the limits of the antero- inferior triangle of the neck; for although somewhat concealed at its origin by the sterno- clavicular articulation, yet it may be removed from under cover of that joint, by extending the neck, and depressing forcibly the shoulder and clavicle. Relations.—a. Pleura.—The pleura is an anterior relation of the commencement of the left, but a posterior relation of the termina- tion of the right subclavian artery. b. Veins. —1. The satellite vein of the right subclavian artery, in its first stage (the right vena innominata), is parallel to the artery, though on a plane anterior and inferior to it, whilst the corresponding vein on the left side crosses the left subclavian at right angles. 2. The internal jugular vein runs parallel to the left, but intersects at right angles the front of the right subclavian artery. 3. The vertebral vein is usually anterior to the artery of the left, but posterior to the artery of the right side. c. Nerves.—The phrenic, vagi, and sympa- thetic nerves are necessarily parallel to the left subclavian artery, in the first stage of its course, in consequence of its vertical direction, whilst they run at right angles to the corresponding part of the right, by reason of its transverse course; in other respects, however, these nerves hold the same relative position to the subclavian arteries at either side, the phrenic and vagus being anterior, and the sympathetic posterior, to the right and left subclavians respectively. Lastly, the recurrent laryngeal nerve passes behind the right subclavian artery, looping round its under surface, whilst the nerve on the left side encircles the arch of the aorta, internal to the origin of the left sub- clavian artery; the recurrent is consequently related to the inner side of the left subclavian artery, but at no part of its course does it lie posterior to that vessel. d. The thoracic duct and wsophagus are817 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. connected with the artery of the left side, exclusively. The former holds a double relation to that vessel; in the thorax it passes behind it, in the neck it rises high above it, and then bends downwards in front of it, to open into the confluence of the great veins. The oeso- phagus, as has been mentioned, lies to the right of the artery. The differences which have thus been pointed out, are of material importance with reference to the operations upon these two arteries. In the remainder of their course the sub- clavian arteries are perfectly symmetrical, and one and the same description will apply to both. Subclavian arteries in their second stage. — In its second stage each subclavian artery lies in a remarkable intermuscular space, bounded by the scaleni muscles. These muscles (sca- lenus anticus and .scalenus posticus)areclosely approximated to each other at their attach- ment to the tubercles of the cervical trans- verse processes; but in descending to their insertions they diverge, leaving between them a space truly triangular, of which the base, placed inferiorly, corresponds to the first rib, and to a small portion of the second. In this space the subclavian artery, the brachial plexus of nerves, and the cone of the pleura, are situated. In front, the artery is in contact with the anterior wall of this triangle, consti- tuted by the scalenus anticus muscle; behind, it is separated from the posterior boundary of the triangle by the summit of the cone of the pleura, which ascends thus high into the interval between the scaleni, interposing itself between the scalenus posticus and the subcla- vian artery. Towards the summit of this " scalene triangle" the nervous cords which constitute the brachial plexus are placed along the convexity of the artery, superior and external to it. A fleshy slip (Scalenus minimus, Soemmering) is often found to pass from the scalenus an- ticus to the lower, or costal extremity, of the scalenus posticus; in this course it runs be- tween the roots of the brachial plexus, and consequently subdivides into two the scalene space. The lower compartment contains the subclavian artery, the cone of the pleura, and the inferior portion of the brachial plexus, constituted by the seventh cervical nerve, and the cord resulting from the union of the eighth cervical, with the first dorsal nerve; whilst in the upper compartment (corresponding to the apex of the triangle), the fifth and sixth nerves of the plexus are seen to unite into a single tru nk. On the front of the scalenus anticus, and separated by that muscle from the subclavian artery, are found the following parts : — Most inferiorly the subclavian vein, lying on the tendinous insertion of the muscle, and under cover of the clavicle; above the vein the transverse branches of the thyroid axis, viz. the supra-scapular, and the transversalis colli arteries, of which the former is the more inferior, whilst the phrenic nerve descends VOL. IV. obliquely inwards towards the tracheal edge of the muscle, and intersects these two trans- verse arteries by passing behind them. Superficial to all these important structures is the clavicular origin of the sterno-cleido- mastoid muscle. In size, shape, and direction, this muscle accurately corresponds to the sca- lenus anticus, which lies deeper than it, and from which it is separated by the parts just now stated, to lie on the front, of that muscle. The separation of the subclavian vein from the subclavian artery in their second stage, " constitutes one of the most remarkable fea- tures in its (anatomical) history ;" this con- dition is not, however, constant, for the vein has been found to lie with the artery between the scaleni (Blandin), and, in a few other equally rare instances, the artery has accom- panied the vein superficial to both muscles (Manec, Quain). Lastly, the artery has been seen to pass through the anterior scalenus, and hence to lie in part behind and in part in front of that muscle (Quain). It is to be understood that these deviations from the normal arrangement are remarkably infre- quent. The anterior relations of the subclavian ar- tery in its second stage, may be arranged in four orders of parts : — 1. Skin, platysma, fascia. 2. Sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle (its clavi- cular origin). 3. Subclavian vein, supra-scapular and transverse cervical arteries, phrenic nerve, 4. Scalenus anticus muscle. Subclavian artery in its third stage. — After the subclavian artery emerges from beneath the scalenus anticus muscle, it inclines down- wards and outwards, and thus completes the arch which its entire course represents. In this stage its position is marked by precise limits, which are always recognisable, even in the living subject. The artery, with the vein and brachial plexus of nerves, which still ac- company it, is here contained in the postero- infenor triangle of the neck (0mo-clavicular space, Velpeau), the several boundaries of which are constituted by the clavicle, and by the sterno-mastoid and omo-hyoid muscles. Whilst traversing this region the subclavian artery lies at first on the scalenus posticus, and then passes on the upper surface of the first rib. The subclavian vein lies inferior and in- ternal to the artery, and on a more superficial plane than it, throughout the entire of this portion of its course; it also passes with the artery over the first rib. Two superficial grooves in the adult bone mark the trajet and relative position of these great vessels ; a tu- bercle, which gives insertion to the scalenus anticus muscle, separates these grooves from each other (that for the artery is the more posterior of the two); it is constantly present, and serves as a guide to point out with pre- cision the situation of the artery, and so assist the operator to distinguish that vessel from the parts which surround it. Such a guide to the artery is peculiarly valuable, because, 3gSUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 818 in operations upon the larger blood-vessels, the touch often fails to discriminate the pro- per object, the characteristic pulsation of a large artery being, under such circumstances, often wanting. In the postero-inferior triangle of the neck the artery is covered by the integument, su- perficial fascia and platysma, descending su- perficial (supra-clavicular) twigs of the cervical plexus, anil by the external jugular vein. The situation of this vein in the supra-clavicular space, is subject to much variety ; it most fre- quently runs near to the inner boundary of the triangle and parallel to the outer edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, but frequently de- scends in the very centre of the space ; in the latter case it much embarrasses the operator in attempting to expose the subclavian artery. Next in order, a number of conglobate glands, and a plexus of anastomosing veins, principally from the scapular region, come into view; these latter usually communicate with the external jugular, or with the subclavian vein. Areolar tissue which presents a laminated arrangement encloses these glands and super- ficial vessels, and isolates them from the deeper-seated parts. These structures being removed, the sub- clavian artery appears to lie within a second triangle of smaller dimensions, bounded inter- nally by the scalenus anticus muscle, externally and superiorly by the omo-hyoid muscle, and inferiorly by the first rib; this bone represents the base of the triangle, and over it the artery is seen to pass. At this depth, two collateral arterial branches of considerable size cross the supra-clavicular space, the one, the trans- versals colli, above, the other, the supra- scapular, below the level of this portion of the subclavian artery; the latter is placed under cover of the clavicle, and in contact with the front of the subclavian vein. As the supra- scapular artery pursues its course towards the shoulder, it crosses in front of the subclavian artery and of the brachial plexus of nerves. Here likewise the clavicle and the subclavius muscle constitute additional anterior relations of the subclavian artery, now near its termi- nation. The nervous bundle of the brachial plexus is parallel to the subclavian artery in its third stage, and lies superior and external to the vessel; in its descent the lower division of the plexus overhangs the artery, and one or two of the branches (anterior thoracic) cross the anterior surface of the artery, and some- times even encircle it in a nervous loop. The anterior relations of the third stage of the subclavian artery may therefore be thus arranged: — 1. Integument, superficial cutaneous nerves, platysma, fascia. 2. Areolar tissue in layers, glands, external jugular vein, an intricate plexus of smaller veins. 3. Anterior thoracic branches of the bra- chial plexus, the subclavian vein, supra-sca- pular artery, clavicle, and subclavius muscle. , Anomalies in the origin of the subclavian ar- teries.—1. The right subclavian artery some- times arises separately from the arch of the aorta, in which case there is no arteria inno- minata ; the branches that arise from the arch of the aorta are then four in number, but con- siderable variety has been observed in the relation which the right subclavian bears to the other three branches ; thus, a. It may occupy the usual position of the innominate artery, being the first in order of the branches of the arch of the aorta; its re- lations within the thorax will then correspond with those assigned to the vessel whose place it comes to occupy. b. It may be the second in numerical order of the branches of the arch, arising after the right carotid artery, behind which it subse- quently passes to arrive at its proper position in the neck. c. It may arise after the two carotids as the third branch of the arch; or, d. It may be the last branch of the aorta, and occupy the usual situation of the left sub- clavian artery. Of the varieties already men- tioned, this is the most frequently met with, and, according to the statistics of Pro- fessor Quain, it occurs once in every 250 examinations. e. Sometimes (but much more rarely) this vessel arises below the arch, from the thoracic aorta, and its position may be so low, that it will furnish some of the upper intercostal arteries. The course of the artery, when it thus arises from the left of the arch, is very remarkable ; it crosses in front of the spinal column, either behind the oesophagus, or between that tube ami the trachea, and necessarily passes across the neck behind all the other branches given off from the arch of the aorta. When thus ab- normally situated behind the oesophagus, it has been accidentally wounded by a foreign body which had first transfixed that tube. A remarkable example of this occurrence is mentioned by Mr. Kirby, in the 2d vol. of the Dublin Hospital Reports. The irregularity in question, of the right subclavian artery, was regarded by Dr. Bay- ford as the cause of difficult deglutition, in a case which had been accurately observed for many years, and this new disease, as he con- sidered it, he quaintly termed " Dysphagia lusoria" * In those instances, where the right sub- clavian artery has been found to deviate thus strangely from its usual course, the inferior laryngeal nerve presented a remarkable change of direction, depending no doubt on the altered course of the artery; in all the instances which were noted, the nerve was given off from the pneumogastric, higher up than usual, and passed directly to the larynx, so as not to be entitled to the name of "recurrent." Dr. Hart, who first directed attention to this fact, has thus clearly explained the connection be- tween the unusual position of the artery and * Memoirs of the Medical Society of London, vol. ii. 1793.SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. S19 3 g 2 the altered direction of the nerve : " In the ear- lier periods of the existence of the fuetus, the rudiment of the head appears as a small pro- jection from the upper and anterior part of the trunk, the neck not being yet developed. The larynx at this time is placed behind the ascending portion of the arch of the aorta ; while the brain, as it then exists, is situated so low, as to rest on the thymus gland and front of that vessel. Hence it is that the inferior laryngeal nerves pass back to the larynx, se- parated by the ascending aorta, the left going through its arch, while the right goes below the arteria innominata. " As gestation advances, the head becomes more distinct, and the neck begins to be formed after the second month, which, as it lengthens, has the effect of removing the brain upwards to a greater distance, and of drawing out the larynx from the chest, in consequence of which the nerves of the par vagum and their recurrents become elongated, and hence the circuitous route the latter are found to take afterwards, forming loops in which the aorta and right subclavian artery are, as it were, suspended."* 2. The left subclavian artery is much less liable to vary in the mode of its origin than the right; the varieties observed are also fewer in number, a. The origin of the left sub- clavian artery is sometimes more approximated than usual to the origin of the left carotid, and in a few instances, b. its origin is fused into that of the latter, so that these two vessels arise by a common trunk, which is a left arteria innominata. It has been observed in those instances where the arch of the aorta is reversed, so as to pass from left to right, that the same irre- gularities affect the transposed branches which then arise from it, as have been stated to occur when the arch holds its more usual po- sition. Branches of the subclavian arteries.—In the number and arrangement of the branches of the subclavian artery so much variety occurs, that no general description could, perhaps, be given, which would accurately describe their arrangement in any one instance, and hence, in works on anatomy, much discrepancy exists on this subject; the following description agrees with that of the best authorities in this country, and is strictly in accordance with theaccuratestatistical details of Professor Quain. In its first stage the subclavian artery usually gives origin to the following branches—the vertebral, internal mammary, and thyroid axis ; the last, after a very short course, divides in a radiating manner into the inferior thyroid, the supra-scapular (transversalis humeri), and the transverse cei-vical (transversalis colli) arteries ; besides, in the majority of instances, the left subclavian artery, in its first stage, furnishes (in addition to the branches already * Dr. Hart, in Edinb. Med. and Surg. Journal, 1826. enumerated) the superior intercostal artery, a branch which, on the right side, more fre- quently arises under cover of the scalenus anticus muscle. All these branches arise nearer to the scaleni muscles, and are conse- quently more immediately covered by the internal jugular vein on the left side of the neck than on the right. The position of these branches of the sub- clavian artery, especially on the right side, is of much interest in a surgical point of view. " The situation in which the branches arise from any large artery is an important con- sideration in its history, because of the influ- ence which their presence has on the result of an operation for the cure of aneurism. And, considering the shortness of the trunk, the size of the offsets, and the manner of their arrangement on the parent vessel, it may be confidently stated that there is no artery in which the influence alluded to is more considerable than in the subclavian."* The following statistics, derived from the author just quoted, are useful to show the average length of the subclavian artery, from its origin to the point where its first branch arises; in other words, the extent of the artery in its first stage, suitable for the appli- cation of a ligature. In sixty-five bodies examined, this distance measured — i inch and under - - - in 8 More than a inch and not exceed- ing 1 inch - - - - ,, 33 More than 1 inch and not exceed- ing 1| inch - - - - „ 23 If inch (the extreme length) - „ 1 Occasionally, the vertebral, or inferior thy- roid artery, has been seen to arise very close to the arteria innominata. In the second stage the subclavian artery most frequently gives off but a single branch, which soon subdivides into the ccrvicalis pro- funda and superior intercostal arteries. It is less usual for these two arteries to arise separately; thus, in 285 examinations, this occurred in the proportion of but 1 to 2CH, whereas the former arrangement existed in 266 out of the entire number. In the majority of instances no branches arise from the subclavian artery external to the scaleni; but the jwsterior scapular artery (in general the continued trunk of the transver- salis colli) frequently arises from the third stage of the subclavian, and so frequently, indeed, that Cruveilhier regards it, not as a variety, but as the normal arrangement. It is computed by Professor Quain that this occurs in the proportion of 1 in 2± cases. I. Vertebral artery. — This artery, which is the first and largest, is at the same time one of the most regular of the branches of the subclavian artery, from the upper and posterior * Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body, with its Applications to Pathology and Operative Surgerv (Plates). Bv Prof. Quain." Part VI.820 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. aspect of which it usually arises. There is no example on record where this branch arose either between or beneath the scaleni muscles. From its origin, the vertebral artery assumes a direction upwards, backwards, and slightly outwards to the foramen, in the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra ; having passed through this, it is transmitted from vertebra to vertebra by the foramina which their transverse processes present, until finally it traverses the foramen magnum, where its cerebral, or cranial, stage commences. Relations. — From its origin until it enters the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, the vertebral artery is placed in a muscular interspace, between the longus colli and the scalenus anticus muscles, where it is related in front to the trunk of the subclavian artery, to its own vein, and to the inferior thyroid artery ; the last of these, as it passes transversely inwards, is interposed between the vertebral vessels and the sheath of the carotid artery (in the sheath, the internal jugular vein exactly corresponds to the anterior sur- face of the vertebral artery). By its posterior surface, the vertebral artery is in relation with the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympa- thetic nerve. From the sixth to the second cervical ver- tebra inclusive, the vertebral artery is lodged in the bony foramina of the transverse pro- cesses ; in the spaces between these, it is enclosed by the pairs of intertransverse muscles, being in close contact with the anterior set, whilst from the posterior it is separated regularly by the spinal nerves in their trajet outwards. In this part of its course the artery is slightly tortuous, a provision, no doubt, to guard it against injury in the free and varied motions of this portion of the spine. For a similar reason its tortuosity increases remarkably in the subsequent stage. Having passed through the transverse pro- cess of the axis, the vertebral artery inclines outwards and slightly upwards, to reach the foramen in the transverse process of the atlas, a deviation from the former vertical course of the artery which is rendered necessary by the superior breadth of the first vertebra. Whilst engaged in the curved canal {not foramen) of the transverse process of the atlas, the artery bends abruptly backwards and inwards, so that on emerging from this bone it becomes horizontally placed on the upper surface of the posterior arch of the atlas. Between the occipital bone and the atlas the artery describes a curve, of which the concavity, looking forwards and inwards, embraces the occipito-atlantal articulation, whilst the convexity, directed backwards and outwards, is contained in a triangular space, circumscribed in the following manner by the small rotator muscles of the head. The sides of this triangle are constituted by the superior and inferior oblique muscles respectively, the apex is at the transverse process of the atlas, where both these muscles are attached ; whilst the rectus capitis posticus major (placed in- ternally) represents the base. Deeply situated in this triangular space, the vertebral artery is covered by the splenitis and com plexus muscles, and rests on the posterior arch of the atlas ; the bone presents a groove for the reception of the artery ; but the sub-occipital nerve, which frequently forms its ganglion in this situation, is interposed. The space which has just been described is occupied by yellow, granular-looking fatty matter, and the occi- pital artery winds along its upper boundary, freely anastomosing with the vertebral. The vertebral artery next passes beneath the lower edge of the posterior occipito-atlan- tal ligament, then perforates the dura mater, and, taking a direction upwards, forwards, and inwards, enters the cranium through the foramen magnum. The posterior occipito- atlantal ligament, by arching over the groove on the upper surface of the atlas, forms a foramen for the transmission of the artery. As the vertebral artery advances through the foramen magnum, it passes between the first and second tooth-like insertions of the ligamentum dentatum, and then ascends, lying on the anterior surface of the first of these processes, by which it is separated from the spinal accessory nerve, which latter passes upwards on the posterior surface of the liga- ment ; here the Ungual nerve passes outwards to the anterior condyloid foramen, above the level of the artery. Within the cranium, the vertebral arteries, corresponding at first to the lateral aspects of the upper portion of the medulla oblongata, approximate to each other more and more as they ascend, and ultimately unite at an acute angle, opposite the inferior edge of the pons varolii ; in this manner the basilar trunk is formed. Basilar artery (Artere meso-cephalique, Chaussier).—This artery, larger than either of the vertebral arteries, is yet much less capa- cious than the two vessels conjointly which unite to form it ; its length corresponds accurately to the longitudinal measurement of the pons varolii; it runs along the median depression of the pons, lodged between that body and the upper surface of the basilar process of the occipital bone, and preserved from pressure by the double concavity of the surfaces between which it is interposed. At its commencement the basilar artery separates from each other the sixth nerves of the opposite sides ; the arachnoid membrane and the dura mater, with the transverse sinus of Haller, are interposed between the artery and the bone, whilst the pia mater alone intervenes between it and the pons. At the antero-superior edge of the pons the basilar artery usually terminates in four branches, two for the cerebrum and two for the cere- bellum. Branches of the vertebral artery. — 1. Branches to the praevertebral muscles, which anastomose with the cervicalis ascendens and superficialis colli arteries. 2. Numerous small branches, which enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral821 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. foramina, and which are conducted by the nerves to the spinal cord, where they join and reinforce the proper spinal arteries. 3. In the space between the atlas and occi- pital bone, the vertebral artery sends several long branches down the neck, which are con- cealed by the splenius and complexus muscles. Accompanied by smaller branches of the occi- pital, these arteries keep up an important anastomosis on the back of the neck with the cervicalis profunda. 4, 5. The proper spinal arteries. These are two in number on each side, an anterior and a posterior branch from each vertebral trunk. The posterior spinal arteries arise lower down than the anterior, and pass downwards and backwards to reach the posterior surface of the medulla oblongata; from this the artery of each side descends parallel to its fellow, to which it is connected by numerous transverse branches. Opposite the second lumbar vertebra, the posterior spinal arteries cease to exist as distinct trunks. The anterior spinal arteries are given off from the vertebral near to its termination ; these arteries in descending approximate to each other, and at last unite opposite the lower edge of the medulla oblongata; the single trunk thus formed {anterior median artery of the spinal cord) descends tortuously in front of the medulla spinalis, and, passing through the very centre of the fibres of the cauda equina, reaches the lowest portion of the vertebral canal, when it anastomoses with branches of the sacral arteries. The anterior and posterior spinal arteries are connected in every region of the spine with brandies of arteries which enter the spinal canal through the " foramina of con- junction ;" these reinforcing brandies, as they may be termed, of the spinal arteries (derived front the cervicalis ascendens and vertebral in the neck, from the intercostal in the back, and from the lumbar and sacral arteries in the lower portion of the spinal column), cause these arteries which they join to pre- serve a remarkable uniformity of size through- out their entire course. Both the spinal arteries furnish small branches to the dura mater and to the spinal cord. Branches of the basilar artery. — 1. The inferior (or posterior) cerebellar artery. — This artery seldom arises in precisely the same manner at opposite sides of the same subject. It most frequently springs on one side from the vertebral, and on the other from the basilar trunk. Inclining outwards and backwards, in front of the pyramidal body, the vessel in question passes (according as its origin is from the basilar, or from the vertebral artery) before or behind the sixth nerve; it then runs through the filaments going to form the ninth nerve, and between the pneumogastric and spinal accessory divi- sion of the eighth pair; it is ultimately dis- tributed internally to the inferior vermiform process and sides of the median fissure (a branch or two may be traced into the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle), and externally to the inferior surface and circumference of the cerebellum, where it communicates with the superior artery of the cerebellum. 2. The superior (or anterior) cerebellar artery.—This artery arises near the antero- superior edge of the pons varolii; it passes in a curved direction outwards and backwards, around the line of junction of the pons with the crus cerebri. It is at first parallel to the posterior artery of the cerebrum, but separated from it by the'third nerve. The fourth nerve in its trajet forwards is strictly parallel to the artery as it runs backwards on the side of the pons varolii; the nerve, however, is contained in a canal between the layers of the tentorium, whilst the artery proceeds beneath that par- tition, and in contact with the upper surface of the cerebellum. The branches of the superior cerebellar artery are numerous ; they are distributed to the upper surface and circumference of the cerebellum, anastomosing with the inferior cerebellar artery, and also to the pons varolii, velum interpositum, superior vermiform pro- cess, and valve of Vieussens. One small branch of this artery accompanies and separates the facial and auditory nerves, entering with them into the internal auditory meatus. Lastly, some of its branches pass on the upper surface of the tentorium, and are distributed to the inferior surface of the cerebrum. 3. Posterior artery of the cerebrum. — The two posterior arteries of the cerebrum are the terminating branches of the basilar trunk ; each artery passes at first forwards, then backwards and outwards, following the course of the great cerebral fissure, and partly en- circling the crus cerebri. For a considerable portion of its course the posterior artery of the cerebrum is parallel to the posterior (or inferior) cerebellar artery; the two arteries, however, are separated from one another, at first, by the third nerve (which latter, in its further course, hooks round the posterior artery of the cerebrum), and subsequently by the tentorium. At the point where the posterior artery of the cerebrum changes its direction in order to pass backwards and outwards, it is joined by the " posterior com- municating artery," and by this means a com- munication is established between the internal carotid and basilar arteries. The posterior artery of the cerebrum is chiefly distributed by long slender branches to the inferior surface of the posterior lobe of the cerebrum, but it furnishes, in addition, the following collateral branches:—I. Nume- rous small twigs which enter the floor of the third ventricle, through the apertures in the locus perforatus medius, or are distributed to the crura cerebri, corpora albicantia, and tuber cenereum ; and 2. a choroid branch, which winds round the crus cerebri, enters the cerebral fissure, and is lost in the velum inter- positum, corpora quadrigemina, and choroid plexuses. 3 g 3SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 8i2 Varieties occasionally observable in the verte- bral arteries. — I* Of origin.—a. It lias already been mentioned that the vertebral artery may arise from different portions of the first stage of the subclavian artery being sometimes nearer, and sometimes further removed, from the innominata; but, independently of these varieties, the vertebral artery on the right side is b. Sometimes furnished by the common carotid artery. In all the cases where this anomaly has been observed, the right subcla- vian artery was given off directly as a branch of the aorta. Again, c. The vertebral artery sometimes comes off from the arch of the aorta. This irre- gularity is as unfrequent on the right, as it is common on the left side. When the left vertebral artery springs from the arch of the aorta, it usually arises between the left carotid and the left subclavian arteries, though some- times its origin has been found to the left of all the other branches of the arch. d. In a few instances, more than one vessel has been found to constitute the origin of the vertebral artery; thus, it may be formed by the union of two roots, both arising from the subclavian artery, or one from the subclavian and the other from the aorta. In one exam- ple, where it was formed by three roots, two of these were derived from the subclavian, and the third from the inferior thyroid artery. These roots of the vertebral artery in some instances united before the artery had become engaged in the vertebral foramina, whilst in others the union took place subsequently. 2. Of size.—There is often a considerable difference in the size of the two vertebral arte- ries, which is stated to be most frequently in favour of that of the left side ; thus, in 98 ob- servations made by Mr. Davy, the left verte- bral artery was the larger in twenty-six, and the right in eight instances only. 3. Of course and relations.—The vertebrnl artery may enter the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra (though the contrary has been asserted), or it may enter one of the fo- ramina higher than that in the transverse pro- cess of the sixth, which latter it usually selects. When the artery enters any vertebra higher than the sixth cervical, it always occupies an unusually superficial position in the neck, lying external and parallel to the common carotid artery, for which, consequently, it is liable to be mistaken. (Vide Carotid Ar- tery.) The vertebral vein corresponds to the cer- vical stage only of the artery. Its origin is found in some branches from the deep muscles at the back of the neck, joined by one from the occipital vein, and by another which passes through the posterior condyloid fo- ramen. The vertebral vein traverses the canal in the transverse process of the atlas, and descends through the same foramina by which the artery ascends; whilst here it lies in front of the artery, and has the same relations as that vessel. Emerging from the foramen in the sixth vertebra, the vertebral vein (liable to the varieties already specified) opens into the vena innominata close to its junction with the internal jugular. II. Internal mammary artery.—This ar- tery arises (more externally than the ver- tebral) from the anterior surface of the sub- clavian, and near to the inner margin of the anterior scalenus muscle. From this origin it runs, first forwards, then downwards and inwards, and enters the thorax, lying between the pleura and the internal layer of intercostal muscles. Previous to entering the thorax, the in- ternal mammary artery is crossed anteriorly by the vena innominata and by the phrenic nerve : the latter intersects the artery ob- liquely from above and without, downwards and inwards. In the thorax, however, the nerve attains a position much posterior to the artery. The mammary artery descends on the back of the anterior parieties of the chest a little external to the junction of the costal cartilages with the sternum, and is covered posteriorly by the pleura at the line of reflexion of that membrane to form the side of the anterior mediastinum. Arrived at the cartilage of the third rib, the artery in its farther descent inclines a little outwards, and be- comes separated from the pleura by the fibres of the triangularis sterni; the vessel is now placed between that muscle, which lies behind it, and the internal layer of intercostal muscles and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, which constitute its anterior relations. Opposite the cartilage of the seventh rib the mammary artery terminates by dividing into two branches, an external and an internal. Branches of the mammary artery. — I. Mediastinal branches, which are distributed to the thymus gland {thymic arteries'), and the cellular issue of the anterior mediasti- num. 2. A descending muscular branch to the diaphragm (superior phrenic), also termed, from its so constantly accompanying the phrenic nerve, the comes nervi phrenici. This branch accompanies the nerve in a tortuous manner, between the pleura and the pericardium, to reach the upper surface of the diaphragm, where it anastomoses with the phrenic arte- ries from the aorta. 3. The anterior intercostal arteries.—These are distributed to the six upper intercostal spaces ; but their number is greater than that of the spaces for which they are destined, as two branches are frequently found between adjacent ribs, and this arrangement may even prevail in all of these intercostal spaces. The anterior intercostal arteries pass out- wards in the intervals between the two planes of intercostals, in which muscles some of their branches terminate; others are lost in anasto- mosing with the intercostal arteries from the aorta, whilst many perforate the muscular fibres, and, arriving on the external surface of the thorax, clip into the pectoral musclesSUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 823 3 G A and the mammary gland. In both these latter situations the arteries in question communi- cate freely with the external thoracic branches of the axillary, thus forming an important connection between the circulation of the in- terior and that of the exterior of the thorax. The terminal branches of the internal mam- mary artery are two in number, viz. internal terminal branch (Ramus abdominalis) and an external (Arteria musculo-phrenica, Haller). 4. The internal, or the abdominal branch, is the smaller of the two, yet in direction it represents the parent trunk. Having communi- cated with the artery of the opposite side be- hind the xiphoid cartilage, it escapes from the thorax through a small triangular interval between the fibres of the diaphrpgm, and then immediately enters the sheath of the rectus abdominis, descending between the muscle and the posterior lamina of the sheath. Having arrived opposite the umbilicus, it be- comes distinctly continuous with ascending branches of the internal epigastric artery ; it likewise furnishes many branches to the sub- stance of the rectus muscle, and others which, piercing the sheath, are widely distributed to the broad muscles of the abdomen. 5. The external terminating branch (or the arteria musculo-phrenica), is larger than the internal, from which it separates nearly at right angles, passing almost transversely out- wards in a curved course along the superior line of attachment of the diaphragm to the false ribs. In this course the artery gives off, «. numerous phrenic branches of large size, which enters the diaphragm all along its cos- tal attachment; and b. anterior intercostal branches, which supply the lower intercostal spaces in precisely the same manner as those from the mammary trunk supply the upper, and which have been already described. Varieties.— The mammary artery presents but few varieties either of origin or position ; in 290 out of 297 examinations, this artery occupied its normal position. In one in- stance it arose beneath, in six instances ex- ternal to the scalenus muscle, and in one only of the six was it derived from the axillary artery (Quain). Much more rarely still does the mammary artery deviate in the opposite direction, i.e. inwards; it has, however, been seen to spring from the arch of the aorta, and also from the arteria innominata. Occasionally too it arises in common witli the thyroid axis. Two veins (one on either side of it) accom- pany each internal mammary artery ; they are formed by branches corresponding to those given oft' by the artery, with the exception (according to Cruveilhier) of the vein accom- panying the arteria comes nervi phrenici, which on both sides terminates separately. On the right side the mammary veins open into the commencement of the vena cava; on the left side, they are connected with the corre- sponding vena innominata. " The mammary arteries are remarkable for the number of their inosculations, and for the distant parts of the arterial system which they serve to connect : they anastomose with each other, and their inosculations with the thoracic aorta encircle the thorax. On the parietics of this cavity their branches connect the axillary and subclavian arteries ; on the diaphragm they form a link in the chain of inosculations between the subclavian artery and abdominal aorta ; and in the parieties of the abdomen they form an anastomosis most remarkable for the distance between those vessels which it serves to connect, namely, the arteries of the superior and inferior extremities."* III. Thyroid axis. — This artery springs from the anterior aspect of the subclavian trunk, close to the inner edge of the scalenus amicus muscle, and consequently from the very last portion of the artery in its first stage. The thyroid axis forms a trunk only a few lines in length, winch projects forwards and a little upwards : the phrenic nerve is applied against the outer surface of this artery, and still retains the same relation to it, even where the artery arises more externally than usual, as if in such cases the nerve were drawn outwards by the artery. This arrangement was observed where the thyroid axis arose from the third stage of the subclavian. The thyroid axis usually terminates in three branches :— 1. Inferior thyroid artery.—From the thy- roid axis, this branch passes a little upwards, and then turns inwards and backwards, de- scribing a curve, of which the concavity looks forwards and downwards, corresponding to the carotid sheath. The artery next descends, but soon afterwards inclines upwards and in- wards until it reaches the thyroid body, thus forming a second curve the reverse of the former one, for the concavity of this second curve looks upwards and backwards, and is crossed anteriorly by the recurrent nerve. The anterior relations of this artery are the following :— It is crossed in its first curve, opposite the sixth cervical vertebra, by the sympathetic nerve, which more frequently on the right than on the left side however, joins the middle cervical ganglion in this situation. The inter- nal jugular vein, vagus nerve, and carotid artery, contained in their common sheath, are the next parts which cross the artery ; and lastly, the recurrent nerve, sub-hyoid muscles, and thyroid gland, lie in front of it. The recurrent nerve lies in front of the second curve of the artery. The inferior thyroid artery is posteriorly in relation with the vertebral artery, the longus colli muscle, and the vertebral column ; and, on the left side, with the oesophagus and tho- racic duct. The thoracic duct very frequently passes up behind the inferior thyroid artery to the level of the sixth cervical vertebra, where, bending downwards and forwards, it arches over that vessel and descends in front of it, to terminate in the subclavian vein. * Harrison's Surgical Anatomy of the Arteries. 4th Edition, p. 141. Dublin.SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 82 h Branches of the inferior thyroid artery. — a. Arteria cervicalis ascendens. — This branch (arising from the upper convexity of the thy- roid, where that vessel changes its direction to pass downwards and inwards beneath the carotid sheath) passes upwards on the super- ficial surface of the scalenus anticus, parallel and internal to the phrenic nerve. The cer- vicalis ascendens (frequently as large as the thyroid itself) furnishes numerous muscular branches to the levator anguli scapulae, longus colli, rectus capitis anticus major, and to the scaleni muscles, some of which anastomose with branches of the occipital artery; it like- wise gives off spinal branches, which enter the spinal canal along the cervical nerves, and are distributed to the cord, anastomosing both within and without the canal of the vertebra with the vertebral arteiy. By some anatomists the cervicalis ascen- dens is regarded as a branch of the thyroid axis, from which it not unfrequently arises ; in some rare instances it has originated di- rectly from the subclavian artery. Sometimes it is of very large size, and takes the place of the occipital artery or of the cervicalis pro- funda. b. The inferior thyroid artery furnishes se- veral descending branches, which from their destination may be termed oesophageal, tra- cheal, and bronchial. c. Terminal or thyroid branches. — The inferior thyroid artery becomes extremely tortuous as it approaches the thyroid gland ; at last it divides into two or three large branches, which enter the gland by its deep surface, and which, in the substance and around the margin of the gland, communicate freely with the corresponding artery from the oppo- site side, and with the superior thyroids of the external carotid. The reader is now referred to the article Scapular Region, in which the remaining branches of the thyroid axis, viz. the supra- scapular and transverse cervical arteries, have already been followed to their ultimate distri- bution ; it will be only necessary in this place to describe the cervical portions of these two collateral branches. 2. Supra-scapular artery (Arteria transver- salis humeri). — This artery is at first directed downwards, but having reached the shelter of the clavicle, it passes nearly horizontally out- wards to the superior costa of the scapula. It crosses over the phrenic nerve, the scalenus anticus muscle, and the subclavian vein ; it then runs outwards in contact with the vein, and bound to it by cellular tissue ; it next passes across the subclavian artery and bra- chial plexus of nerves, and finally arrives at the supra-spinal fossa, which it enters by passing over the superior ligament of the scapula. The supra-scapular artery has, anterior to it, the sterno-mastoid muscle, the clavicle, and the omo-hyoid and trapezius muscles. It accu- rately corresponds to the base of the supra- clavicular space. 3. Arteria Transvcrsalis Colli. — This artery is larger than the preceding ; from its origin it passes transversely outwards over the sca- lenus anticus muscle and the phrenic nerve ; at the outer edge of this muscle, it inclines backwards and runs through the midst of the branches of the brachial plexus. The artery at this stage crosses the summit of the omo- clavicular triangle, above the level of the subclavian artery. In the space between the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius, the trans- verse cervical artery gives off a large branch, the cervicalis superficialis, which is destined for superficial structures, integuments, pla- tysma, glands, and superficial layer of mus- cles. The cervicalis superficialis ascends in the posterior superior triangle of the neck, through a chain of conglobate glands, and through the meshes of the cervical plexus of nerves, anas- tomosing with branches of the occipital and vertebral arteries, and passing finally under cover of the trapezius, to which it distributes numerous twigs, as also to the levator anguli scapulas and splenius. After this the continued trunk of the trans- verse cervical artery is usually called posterior scapular artery, which has elsewhere been described. The posterior scapular, and the cervicalis superficialis arteries, very frequently arise se- parately, instead of springing by a common trunk from the thyroid axis; in such cases the posterior scapular is usually given off by the subclavian artery external to the scaleni. IV. Arteria Cervicalis profunda. \ These ar- V. Superior Intercostal Artery. J teries (as has been already mentioned) generally arise by a short trunk common to both, from the subclavian in its second stage. An analogy may thus be observed between this trunk and the aortic intercostal arteries; for, like them, it divides into an anterior or intercostal branch (the superior intercostal artery), and a poste- rior or muscular branch (the cervicalis pro- funda). The cervicalis jyrofunda passes from its origin backwards and upwards, between the transverse process of the last cervical ver- tebra and the first rib. When a supernumerary cervical rib exists, the artery then passes be- tween this latter and the first dorsal rib. It thus gains the posterior aspect of the neck, and ascends between the spinous and trans, verse processes of the vertebrae, separated from the laminae by the deep layer of muscles, and covered by the great complexus muscle. In this course the cervicalis profunda anas- tomoses with the large muscular branches which descend from the occipital and verte- bral arteries. The deep cervical artery sometimes passes backwards at a higher or lower level than that above specified ; these deviations must be rare, since none of them existed in 40 subjects ex- amined specially with reference to this subject by Cruveilhier. In the extensive tables col- lected by Professor Quain, and which have already been frequently alluded to in this ar- ticle, seventeen instances are given where this artery passed between the first and second rib; in a very few examples, it escaped fromSUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. 825 the thorax through the second intercostal space, and in some other equally rare cases, it has been seen to penetrate between the sixth and seventh cervical transverse pro- cesses. The superior intercostal artery passes downwards in a tortuous manner into the thorax, and gives offbranches which run out- wards and supply the two or three upper intercostal spaces ; the artery of the right, usually passes to one intercostal space lower than that of the left side. The branch to the first intercostal space is in general the small- est. The trunk of the superior intercoslal artery, as it descends, has the following relations: — in front, it is covered by the pleura and lung; internal to it are placed the first dorsal gan- glion of the sympathetic nerve, and the longus colli muscle ; whilst posteriorly, it corresponds to the first dorsal spinal nerve (in its ascent to join the last cervical), and to the neck of the first rib. In addition to the branches furnished to the intercostal spaces, and which are two or three in number, the superior intercostal gives off several small branches which enter the spinal canal through its lateral foramina, and also a branch which passes downwards and esta- blishes a communication with the first aortic intercostal artery. It has been already stated that the superior intercostal and the deep cervical arteries most frequently arise by a common trunk; when they arise separately, the left superior inter- costal artery is generally derived from the first stage of the corresponding subclavian artery. Operative proceedings.—It is not intended in this place to enter into all the details con- nected with the surgical relations of the sub- clavian artery, since in the article which treats of the surgical anatomy of the neck will be found clearly described the modes of pro- cedure to be adopted by the surgeon in the operations for the ligature of this artery in different parts of its course; the following few observations, which may be regarded as supplemental to those just alluded to, naturally follow the description which has been given of the subclavian artery in the preceding pages. First stage. — When the relations of the subclavian artery on the right side, internal to the scaleni muscles, are carefully reviewed, the inner half of this stage of the vessel will appear to be the most eligible for the applica- tion of the ligature, and the object of the operator should be to secure the artery on the cardiac side of its vertebral branch, as in that situation the pleura is comparatively little exposed to injury ; the juguiar vein should lie to the outside, and the vagus nerve to the inside of the ligature, and any undue disturbance of these parts, especially of the latter, ought to be most sedulously avoided. The artery was tied, for the first time in this situation, by Mr. Colles.in the year 1813. In that instance, as in every subsequent one where the operation has been repeated, the result has proved unfavourable ; nevertheless, success has been so nearly attained in some of these cases, that few will be found to agree with Blandin in pronouncing this operation " tout a fait irrationnelle ; " nor are we to view with favour the alternative first suggested by Mr. Shaw, and lately revived and recom- mended to the profession in some recent works on surgery, viz., to remove the arm at the shoulder-joint, and to make pressure on the aneurismal tumour. In the majority of the cases in which hitherto the subclavian artery has been tied internal to the scaleni, the cause of death was referable to secondary haemorrhage ; the un- avoidable proximity of the ligature on the one hand to the heart, on the other to the aneur- ismal sac, and the small extent of this part of the subclavian artery to which a ligature can be applied, without interfering with the colla- teral branches, are probably the chief circum- stances which determine this fatal accident. If, in the desire to avoid the vertebral, thyroid, and mammary branches, the ligature be ap- plied too close to the mouth of the carotid artery, the current of blood through the latter vessel will then, with almost positive certainty, disturb those sanative processes at the seat of ligature, on which the ultimate success of the operation depends; and hence, doubtless, has originated the proposal to secure at the same time both branches of the innominata. The incisions necessary to expose the one, would amply suffice for the ligature of the other ; the circulation through the head and upper extremity might afterwards be carried on without material injury, and the formation of a coagulum, more lengthy than that afforded by the operations hitherto performed, might lead to a favourable result. This suggestion is due to Dr. Hayden, and is mentioned in his account of the case in which he tied this artery in its first stage, so far back as the year 1835. The following brief particulars of a case which lately came under the writer's notice, may be adduced as furnishing an additional ar- gument in favour of this proposal. A woman, about 25 years of age, became the subject of an aneurism, situated at the root of the neck, which was regarded as originating from the arteria innominata. The subclavian and carotid arteries were tied at one and the same time, on the principle of Brasdor:—" On the fourteenth day after the operation, the liga- ture came away from the subclavian artery without any hamorrkage, and every thing pro- mised a favourable result, especially as the pulsation in the tumour had quite disappeared. On the sixteenth day, the patient, a woman of violent temper, had a quarrel with the nurse, when she jumped out of bed, seized a pillow and some books, and threw them at her: while making this exertion, htemorrhage set in from the carotid." A renewal of the hae- morrhage proved fatal. On examination it appeared that "perfect union had taken place where the ligature had been applied to the sub-826 SUBCLAVIAN ARTERIES. ciavian artery, but a small opening was found in the carotid from which the haemorrhage bad proceeded." In this instance the innominata was health}'; but, a little to the left of the origin of that vessel, the aneurismal tumour, which was of a pyrifonn shape, sprung from the arch of the aorta, and thence passed upwards into the neck, in front of, and overlapping the arteria innominata. It is an extremely interesting circumstance connected with this case, " that the tumour was filled with a firm coagulum." This is the only instance, as far as the writer knows, in which a ligature placed on the sub- clavian artery, in its first stage, became detached without the supervention of secondary haemor- rhage. In none of the cases where this artery alone was secured did this circumstance occur, much less in any of these instances did "per- fect union," the result of adhesive inflamma- tion, follow the application of the ligature.* Until very recently it was thought that the ligature of the subclavian artery internal to the scaleni was feasible on the right side only, and this opinion of British surgeons originated perhaps in Mr. Colles' statement, that " this operation, difficult on the right, must be deemed impracticable on the left subclavian artery." Dr. Rodgers, of New York, has, however, lately succeeded in securing the left subclavian artery in its first stage. The result of this case does not verify the opinion of Velpeau, that " the operation would be much less dangerous on the left side than on the right," as the patient died of secondary hae- morrhage on the fifteenth day. British anatomists will be little disposed to agree with Velpeau in such a prediction, and still less will they concur with him in thinking that it would be easier to tie the left sub- clavian artery than the right; on the contrary, the great depth of the left subclavian trunk from the surface, the short distance to which it rises out of the thorax, and the close con- nection of the veins and nerves with its anterior surface, must entitle this operation to the distinction of being one of the most difficult, whilst the peculiar and unseen risk of wound- ing the thoracic duct must ever render it one of the most dangerous, in surgery. Second stage. — The subclavian artery has been tied between the scaleni muscles in a few instances. This operation was first per- formed by Dupuytren, in 1819, in a case of traumatic axillary aneurism ; the result was successful; yet there is nothing in this opera- tion to recommend it, provided there be the option of tying the artery in the supra-clavi- cular space. Dupuytren did not (as some have supposed) intend it to supersede the latter operation ; he advised it in those cases only, where the depth of the vessel in its * The full details of this interesting case, which occurred in the practice of Dr. Hobart, of Cork, will be found in the forthcoming edition of " Fluid's Sur- gical Anatomy of the Arteries," edited by Dr. Power, one of the lecturers at the Richmond Hospital School, to whom the writer is indebted for the facts already quoted. third stage is unusually great, in consequence of some peculiarity of development, or the unnatural elevation of the clavicle produced by an aneurismal tumour. The anatomical objections to this innovation, which is sanctioned by the authority of Dupuy- tren, are the following, and they are suffi- ciently important to justify the conclusion that, where a choice exists, the third stage of the artery should always be selected for the application of a ligature. 1st That in order to expose the subclavian artery in its second stage, the division of two muscles is required, viz., the clavicular portion of the sterno •mastoid, and the scalenus anticus. 2d. That considerable risk of injuring the phrenic nerve is incurred. 3d. That the ligature must be in close proximity to the branches usually furnished by the subclavian artery between the scaleni, viz., the cervicalis profunda, and superior intercostal; and, 4th. That from its close connection with the artery, the cone of the pleura is en- dangered. These theoretical objections to the ligature of the subclavian between the scaleni, are not the less deserving of notice because they were originally passed over in silence, and they go far to disprove the " innocuite" of the operation, an advantage which has been claimed for it by Dupuytren.* The objections which have just been enu- merated, are not however of sufficient weight to forbid a repetition of the operation in any case where insuperable difficulties are en- countered in attempting to tie the artery in its third stage ; under such circumstances, the surgeon would evince both skill and dexterity by dividing, as far as necessary, the scalenus anticus muscle, and thus accomplishing the object of the operation; and in so doing he would follow the example of the late Mr. Liston, who, in a parallel case, thus succeeded in securing the artery between the scaleni. Where the outer edge of the muscle alone is divided, and where proper caution is used, the safety of the phrenic nerve is not neces- sarily compromised; but without very great caution in passing the needle, the pleura will suffer injury, as it is placed in close con- tact with the back of the artery. It should also be borne in mind, that the j>hrenic nerve has in a few instances been seen to pass down beneath the clavicle, lying on the outer edge of the scalenus anticus muscle ; should such an anomaly occur in a person subjected to Du- puytren's operation, the nerve could scarcely escape from injury. This irregularity in the cervical stage of the phrenic nerve, has usually been seen in connection with a variety of origin of the axis thyroideus, which has been already adverted to.-j- * Vide " Leeons Oracles," torn. iv.; and M. Marx account of the operation in the " Repertoire Generale d'Anatomie," No. 2. f It may be presumed that the phrenic nerve was thus unusually placed in a case which occurred in the practice of Mr. Bransby Cooper, and which he827 SUPRv\-RENAL CAPSULES. In its third stage, the subclavian artery has very frequently been the subject of operation, and the ligature of the vessel in this situation, in a large number of the cases recorded, has been eminently successful. Mr. Rarnsden, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, in the year 1809, was the first who secured the artery in its third stage, and since then the operation has been successfully repeated by many surgeons, in this as well as in other countries. Although the subclavian artery, above the clavicle, is covered by no muscular fibres except those of the platysma, yet it always lies at a considerable depth, which varies much in different persons; the statement of Lhipuytren will generally be found correct, viz., " that the third part of the course of the subclavian artery is placed more superficially in those who have long, slender necks, with lean and pendant shoulders, but is, on the contrary, deeply hidden in persons who have short, thick necks, and muscular shoulders."* It is an unfortunate circumstance that the disease for which the operation is usually undertaken, should so constantly be the cause of great difficulty in its performance, for an axillary aneurism of any considerable size cannot fail to elevate the clavicle con- siderably. This fact is well illustrated in the embarrassments experienced in a case where the subclavian artery was tied by the late Professor Todd, one of the surgeons of the Richmond Hospital, and which are recorded in the third volume of the Dublin Hospital Reports. So great have been the difficulties experienced in the operation, that on one occasion Sir A. Cooper was obliged to abandon the attempt, and on another (already alluded to) Mr. Liston was compelled to tie the artery between the scaleni, finding it im- practicable to expose the vessel in its third stage. {B. Geo. M'Dowel.) SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. (Die Nebenniere, Germ. Capsules suprarenales sea atrabilarke, Lat. Capsules suprarenales, atra- bilaires, Fr.) — In the bodies of Vertebrata we find a series of organs, which possess a great outward resemblance to the glands, but distinguish themselves from these by the constant absence of a duct. To this class belong the spleen, the thymus, the thyroid, thus narrates in his published lectures: " Some years ago I performed this operation (ligature of the subclavian artery in the supra-clavicular space) on a clergyman, in the presence of the late Dr. Babing- ton and Mr. Travers; no difficulty whatever oc- curred, but immediately after its completion the patient was seized with a constant hacking cough, as if resulting from convulsive motion of the diaphragm. This scarcely ceased night or day until the sixth day after the operation, when he died. No post-mortem examination was permitted; but there can be no doubt, in my mind, that the phrenic nei-ve had been injured, although it could not possibly have been included in the ligature."—Vide Med. Gazette. Lond. Vol. xlii. p. 94. July, 1848. * Lecons Orales, torn. iv. p. 528. and the supra-renal capsules. On account of their great richness in blood-vessels, these organs have been named " blood-glands," or " glands of blood-vessels," or " vascular gang- lia." At present we are tolerably acquainted with the range of their distribution, and the differences of their form in the animal king- dom ; we have, also, some knowledge of their minute structure ; but, on the other hand, their physiological import remains just as ob- scure to the inquirers of the present century as it was to the physicians of ages long gone by. The supra-renal capsules, glandulce supra- renales seu rencs suceenturiati, sen capsulce a/rabi/arice, form, in the higher Vertebrata, a double organ, which is constantly placed in the neighbourhood of the kidneys; and from this situation they have received their name. So, also, in the lower Vertebrata they of'en occupy the same situation ; but, not un fre- quently, they are broken up into a number of small glandular bodies. In the Invertebrata they are altogether absent. We shall successively consider, 1. The larger series constituted by the differences of form of supra-renal capsules in the animal kingdom. 2. Their structure. 3. Their de- velopment. 4. Their physiological relations. I. As already mentioned, supra-renal cap- sules occur only in the Vertebrata. But we cannot attribute them to all of these without exception. In the lowest Amphibia and Fishes, these organs have not yet been indubitably recognised. Among the Mammalia, the supra- renal capsules exhibit everywhere essentially the same structure, in spite of many differ- ences of form, size, and situation. In Man they possess a half-moon shaped, or triangular and flattened form, with an an- tero-posterior slightly arched surface, and a sharp convex margin. At their bases they are deeply excavated, so that by this part they rest on the upper end of the kidney like a cap. The anterior part of the basis of the supra-renal capsule extends for a considerable distance further forwards on the kidney than the hinder part. The whole organ is included in a covering which consists of closely woven areolar tissue ; and inferiority, it is attached by a looser areolar tissue to the kidne}'. At the base of the organ is also found a well- marked fissure, from out of which passes the supra-renal vein, according to Krause's state- ment.* The anterior and posterior surfaces of the supra-renal capsules exhibit an irregu- larly wrinkled appearance, caused by the nu- merous furrows of the areolar tissue. The size of the supra-renal capsules amounts in the adult to 1 — \\ inches (German) in height, and somewhat less in breadth. The greatest antero-posterior thickness occurs in its lowest part, and amounts from 24—4 lines. In their middle the supra-renal capsules are consider- ably thinner, amounting only to \i—2-| lines. Their absolute weight is estimated" by Meckel * Vide Krause's Handbuch der Anatomic 2. Auflage, Hannover, 184i. Band 1. S. 668.828 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. to be one drachm : according to Krause * it is from 80—120 grains; according to Huschkef from 80—180 grains. The anatomist last named found that its specific weight in the newly-born infant was 1*0333 ; but Krause states the supra-renal capsules of the adult to be of the somewhat lower specific gravity of 1-0163. The two supra-renal capsules of the same individual are generally of different size. Usually the right is of somewhat lesser height, but greater breadth, than the left, which has the contrary diameter the larger. The so-called accessory supra-renal capsules are often found in man. They are small round corpuscles, which, in various numbers, are attached loosely to the inner border of the supra-renal gland, or are sometimes im- bedded in an excavation on its surface. The supra-renal capsules of the Mammalia essentially correspond with this description.\ They are always situated on the upper part of the kidneys ; sometimes towards the inner part, sometimes on the upper part of their border, as in man. Sometimes they are not so closely attached to the urinary organs as in man, but are somewhat more removed from them. Thus, for instance, are arranged the supra-renal capsules of the Elephant and Seal. But, in opposition to this constancy of situation of these organs, we find very considerable differences in respect of their size and form. The supra-renal capsules of Monkeys closely approach the shape seen in the human sub- ject ; but, not unfrequently, their size seems somewhat more considerable. Among the Carnwora they are, in the Dog, of an elongated cylindrical form, sometimes thicker at the margin than in the middle, and of a dense solid texture. So also in the Cat, in whom they are roundish, and somewhat flat- tened. Amongst Insectivora they have in the Mole (Talpa europcett) the form of a three- sided pyramid. In the Seal they appear very small, and Cuvier found that their size was, to that of the kidneys, as I —150. In this latter animal the whole surface of the supra-renal capsules is divided into a multitude of lobules, or acini. Amongst all the Mammalia, these blood-glands are largest in the Rodentia, their ratio to the kidneys being as 1 to 4 and 5 : this is the case, to wit, in Ccelogenys Paca, and in the Guinea-pig (Cavia cobaki). They are roundish, and somewhat flattened, in the Rabbit and the Dipus. The supra-renal cap- sules of the Mouse, the Rat, and the Myoxus Glis, have a shorter form ; while, on the other hand, in Hysrrix they become more cylindrical. * Loc. cit. \ Huschke, Lehre von der Eingeweiden unci Sin- hesorgaaen des menschlichen Korpers. Leipzig, 1844, S. 357. % Concerning the differences of form of the supra- renal capsules may be consulted the well-known text-books on comparative anatomy of Cuvier and Meckel ; and, especially, Nagel in Mailer's Archiv for 1836, S. 365., and Ecker, Die feinere Bau der Nebennieren, Braunschweig, 1846. Amongst the Pachydermata they have, in the Elephant, the form of an elongated cone, and their base is divided into two lobes, and turned backwards. In the Pig, their form is about midway between the cylindrical and the pris- matic. Besides this, the supra-renal capsules of this animal possess a considerable size. In the Horse they are flattened and triangular, approaching the human form. Among the Ruminantia they are, in the Rein-deer, of an oval form, which approximates to the sphe- rical. They are elongated in the Sheep. In the Ox, their shape in some degree resembles that of the kidney. Here they are almost crescentic, not unlike a horse-shoe, and their upper extremity is three-sided. Finally, the sup -a-renal capsules of Cetaceans are, like those of the Seal, exceedingly small, and broken up into a number of small lobes. We find a similar correspondence in the class of Birds. Their supra-renal capsules are generally small in proportion to the size of the body j sometimes spherical, sometimes oval; and, in general, divided into lobules. They lie at the inner extremity of the anterior part of the kidnej, often close to the inferior vena cava ; and they are covered by the tes- ticles, or ovaries. In the ReptUia these organs are much less known, since only isolated (and not unfre- quently contradictory) observations have been made respecting them. Hitherto they have not been found among the Derotremate, Pe- rennibranchiate, and Cajcilian orders of this class. The supra-renal capsules of the Saurians have been very eagerly examined, and most exactly in the genus Lacerta. In these ani- mals Nagel found them along the upper ex- tremity of the vas deferens, in the form of two long, small, lobulated bodies. Nagel's obser- vations have been recently confirmed, and added to, by Ecker. The supra-renal cap- sules, possessing the form stated by Nagel, have a length of \\ lines, with a breadth of 1^,. They lie closely on the vena renalis re- vehens, or on the vena cava ascendens, which is constituted by the two efferent renal veins. Since the right supra-renal capsule is usually of somewhat larger size, it is wont to lie on the vena cava itself; while the left organ is placed upon the vena renalis revehens. In the male lizard the supra-renal capsules are placed between the vein and the vas deferens ; in the female they are situated between that vessel and the ovary. Numerous blood-ves- sels convey the blood from it into the corre- sponding veins. The blind worm (Anguis fragilis) also possesses long, small, supra-renal capsules ; and so, probably, do the Crocodilus Lucius and Ameiva teguixin. Nevertheless, both the latter animals are at present insuffi- ciently examined. The supra-renal capsules of the Ophidia ex- hibit a similar condition, the more exact knowledge of which we especially owe to Retzius. They form two long and small bodies, and in the Python binistatus they at- tain a length of 8 lines. The supra-renal829 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. capsules of serpents are likewise distinctly tabulated, and very vascular. In other re- spects, too, the arrangement of the vascular system exhibits much that is interesting ; hut to this we shall hereafter return. They always lie closely on the venae rcnalcs abdu- centes ; and, according to the course taken by the vessels just named, they are sometimes nearer, sometimes farther from, the testicles and ovary. Batraehia. Formerly many zootomists regarded as supra-renal capsules those pecu- liar yellow finger-shaped masses of fat, which, in these animals, lie superficially to the kid- neys, and possess a connection with the sexual organs, in the periodical increase of which they take a share. Only recently have the true supra-renal capsules been recognised ; and to these the fatty bodies just mentioned have not the remotest resemblance. To Rathke*, Retziusf, Gruby J, and others, we owe the discovery and description of these organs ; the signification of which receives an additional and complete confirmation from minute anatomy, as will be hereafter shown. Here the supra-renal capsules no longer form an organ anatomically defined, but are imme- diately deposited on the abdominal surface of the substance of the kidneys. Among the tailless Batrachia, they appear in this situation as a golden-yellow streak, which does not extend the whole length of the kidney, but ceases at a distance of one line from its upper, and of two lines from its lower, end. These supra-renal organs also allow a lobular composition to be very dis- tinctly discerned ; and they do not extend along the kidney in a straight line, but usually digress into the arched form. They surround the trunks of the efferent renal veins at their exit from the substance of the kidney ; so that they seem to be, as it were, perforated by this vessel. By a more careful investiga- tion one may satisfy one's self that the glands are really imbedded in the coats of these vessels. In the tailed Batrachia, on the other hand, we no longer find the supra-renal capsules in the shape of this connected streak, but broken up on all sides into from twenty to thirty separate and irregular lobules. These are seated, partly in the substance of the kidney at its inner border, partly between the kidney and the inferior cava ; while they are also partly deposited on the coats of the latter vessel, and the gland-lobules have the same relation to the efferent renal veins as in the tailless Batrachians. Finally, amongst all the orders of Reptilia, the supra-renal capsules are least recognised in the Chclonia. The statements formerly made by Bojanus §, that the supra-renal cap- * Beitrage zur Gcseliichte der Thierwelt, Dritto Abtheilung, Halle, 1825, S. 34. + Vide the treatise of Nagel. % Annales des Sciences Naturelles.

Folio cum tab. sulcs were two long bodies, situated at the inner margin of the kidneys, and a similar statement of Nagel *, have been lately cor- rected by Ecker.-j- According to the last in- quirer, the supra-renal capsules of the Tes- tudo grceca altogether correspond, both as regards form and situation, with the similar organs of the Frog ; since they lie on the abdominal surface of the kidney, imbedded in its mass, and extend almost the whole length of this organ. In Fishes the supra-renal capsules again appear; but, as regards their situation, form, and number, they are much more diverse than in the other Vertebrata. The supra-renal organs of the cartilaginous fishes were dis- covered, a long time ago, by Retzius.\ For a knowledge of them in the osseous fishes, we are especially indebted to Stannius and Ecker. In the osseous fishes they appear as small, whitish corpuscles, of the size of from a pin's head to a pea. Their form is, in general, roundish or oval ; their surface is sometimes smooth, sometimes rugged, and broken up into lobules, as is the case in the Pike. Ac- cording to the observations of Stannius, they have not unfrequently a kidney-shaped form in the Haddock; and, according to Ecker, they are sometimes triangular in the Salmon. The number and situation of the supra- renal capsules varies greatly in this group of fishes. The presence of two supra-renal capsules ought to be regarded as the rule. They usually lie symmetrically in both halves of the body, as in the higher animals ; they may also occur a-symmetrically, or only in one half of the body, as in the genus Pleuro- nectcs ; or they may be behind each other, as in the genus Scomber. But frequently, the supra-renal capsules are present in great number ; in which case their position becomes altogether irregular. Thus one meets with three, four, six, or even more supra-renal organs ; and Ecker has observed as many as six in the Salmon. In the Pike, in which only two to three supra-renal capsules are present in the adult animal, the inquirer just mentioned found that, in a young animal of one foot in length, the whole kidney was beset with a great number of very small supra- renal organs. I have myself remarked the same condition, and occurring exactly in the manner described, in two Pikes of the same size : but, on the other hand, in another in- stance it was absent. As to the situation of the supra-renal organs in the bony fishes, this also is subject to very great differences. Sometimes these glands lie more on the abdominal, sometimes on the spinal, surface of the kidneys. The former seems more frequently to happen ; and in this case they generally project at the hinder end of the kidney, from the anterior margin of the haemal canal of the inferior * Loc. cit. f Loc. cit. % Observationes in Anatomiam Chondropteiy- gyiorum. Lund. 1819, 4to.SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 830 vertebral arch : this occurs in the genera Cyprinus, Tinea, Pleuronectes, Anarrhichas, Scomber. Or they occupy more the middle of the kidney, as in the Salmo Salar. On the other hand, they are found on its abdominal surface in the Eel and Pike. They lie in this situation very anteriorly, occupying, in the Eel, the place where the two crura of the renal mass unite. In the Pike they are yet more advanced forwards, so that they come to lie in the middle point of the length of the body. Amongst the cartilaginous fishes, the supra- renal capsules seem in the Squalidae to be only present as a single mass. This, in the shape of a small ochre-yellow stripe, oc- cupies the dorsal surface of the kidneys. But in the Rays the supra-renal organs form a curved cylinder, which is constricted at two points, and lies on the ureters; at least Retzius formerly stated this to be its condi- tion. Stannius sometimes found in this genus a similar elongated body behind the kidneys : or, in other instances, four or five small glan- dular corpuscles were present in its place. And the latter observer found that the supra- renal glands of the Sturgeon * consisted of similar corpuscles in much larger number. The supra-renal capsules of the cartila- ginous fishes have a yellow colour, and are also plainly lobulated. As has been previously remarked, in the least developed fishes the supra-renal cap- sules have not been discovered, at least not with any certainty, so that their existence must remain a matter of doubt. In the Myxinoid fishes, J. Midlerf found behind the gills, and on each side of the cardia, a clus- tered gland which was devoid of an excretory duct. He interprets it as a supra-renal organ; and regards as analogous to it the white specks with which the trunks of the posterior veins of the body are beset in the Ammo- castes.:]; But the minute structure of the glands in question in the Myxinoid fishes, which is also described by Mu'ler, seems ra- ther to contradict the explanation attempted. And Ecker discovered a gland in the Petro- myzon between the aorta and the great vein of the body, and partly lying in the coat of the latter : but this also had not the struc- ture of a supra-renal capsule. II. We next proceed to the minute struc- ture of the supra-renal capsules, concerning which Ecker has given a very good and fun- damental description, so that we shall here in great degree follow him. In Man and all the Mammalia, they exhibit two kinds of sub- stance, which have been designated by the names of cortical and medullary substance. The first is clearer than the la'.ter, being in Man of a yellowish-brown colour ; while the * Stannius, Lehrbuch dor Vergleichender Ana- tomie der Wirbelthiere, Berlin, 1846, S. 118. t Vergleichende Anatomie der Myxinoiden.

X Rathke, Beitrage zur Gesehichte der Thienvelt, 4te Abtheilung, S. 99. medullary substance possesses a reddish- brown hue. In many instances, the two kinds of substance are little distinguishable by the naked eye, so that the supra-renal capsules exhibit only a simple mass, such as Cuvier has described that of the Elephant to be. Besides this, the amount of the two layers varies very considerably. The cortical substance is of some solidity; while, on the contrary, the medullary matter is very delicate and flaky. This great delicacy, together with its considerable richness in blood-vessels, makes it very probable, that the medullary substance of the supra-renal capsides is de- composed very quickly after death. And this gives rise to the formation of a cavity, con- taining a brownish-red fluid, which is not un- frequently found in the interior of the human supra renal capsules. Formerly this cavity was regarded as normal and occurring during life. The name " capsula? atrabilariae" is connected with this notion, since these cavi- ties were described as real by the older ana- tomists. And although decomposition is regarded as the chief agent in the formation of these cavities, yet pathological conditions seem to be by no means without their influence towards them. Thus Rayer tells us the de- velopment of cavities may occur in conse- quence of rupture of the venous coats, an J the effusion of blood in the medullary sub- stance.* Nagel also remarks concerning it, that the supra-renal vein alone, which courses in the centre of the organ, may be instru- mental to the production of such a cavity, albeit a small one ; so that by injections through this vein the whole medullary mass may frequently be torn up, and converted into a cavity. The covering of the supra-renal capsules consists of areolar tissue. At many points of this covering little processes of are- olar tissue pass directly into the interior of the medullary substance, and thus separate it into portions or lobes of different form and size. These masses of areolar tissue are finally lost in fine bundles, which separate the elementary parts of the gland from each other. We shall return to this again. The further composition of the organ which we are now contemplating is better seen in Man than in any others of the Mammalia. Fig. 542.

D7.831 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. In man the cortical substance appears to be composed of an innumerable quantity of completely shut glandular vesicles, which are united into a mass by the ensheathing coats previously mentioned. At the first glance one might easily imagine that they were not gland-vesicles, but tubes which, lying close to each other, take a radiating course from the centre towards the periphery. It is only at cither margin of the cortical substance that the individual small roundish vesicles can be verified. By more careful examination, we can assure ourselves (as was first stated by Ecker) that this tubular appearance is only apparent, and that it is caused by the glan- dular vesicles being arranged in rows, so as to cover each other like the tiles of a roof. In this manner the vesicles of a row, especially when they are filled with dark contents, appear like a tube, with a blind termination at each extremity. The observation just mentioned can be best made if the preparation be treated with a dilute solution of an alkali. It will be thus seen that these vesicles of the supra- renal capsules are surrounded by and con- structed of a fine, structureless, transparent membrane, to the thickness of which we are unable to assign any measurement, and which, even by the use of the highest magnifying powers of the microscope, appears as only a simple line. This structureless membrane, which modern observers have shown to be a constituent of all glands with the single exception of the liver, we shall indicate by the name of the " membrana propria." It is especially distinguished by the fact, that it is not attacked by the dilute alkalies, as caustic potash, and ammonia, but preserves exactly its original appearance ; while the contents of the gland are in general completely dissolved by these agents. The use of these applica- tions cannot be too much recommended in examining the glands, as for instance those of the stomach, intestine, &c.—a fact which has been taught me by repeated experiments. The gland-vesicles of the human supra-renal capsules exhibit considerable differences of size; besides which, their form is wont to vary in some degree. The smaller vesicles are roundish, and have a diameter of 8 to 12-1000ths of a line; the larger of these, which seem elongated, have a length of 18 to 25-1000ths of a line, with a breadth of 10 to 15-1000ths. The smallest of these vesicles occur in the greatest numbers at the limits of the medullary substance ; while, on the con- trary, the larger and more elongated vesicles generally occupy its middle. The glandular contents, which are surrounded by the vesicles, appear, by a low magnifying power, as a dense pap-like mass, which seems to be white by reflected, and dark by transmitted light, and consist of granules. Nevertheless on the application of a powerful lens four consti- tuents maybe distinguished; namely, — (1) very fine molecules, (2) fatty granules, (3) nuclei, and finally, (4) cells in different stages of their development. (1) The fine elementary granules constitute by far the great mass of the contents. They are dissolved by alkalies, but alcohol and ether do not effect their solution, and they are little dissolved by acetic acid; so that they would thus seem to consist of an albuminous substance, or of a so-called protein-com- pound. They are immeasurably minute, anil in this respect resemble the pulverulent molecules which cause the white colour of the chyle.* Their quantity in the gland- vesicles is so large that they render viscous their fluid contents. It is only on the appli- cation of water, that they aggregate them- selves into masses or flocculi: previously to this they pervade the viscid fluid with the greatest uniformity. We will select for them the name of pulverulent molecules. 2. The fatty granules are usually met with in considerable quantity) and sometimes they are very numerous. As may readily be ima- gined, they are of very different diameters, and range graduallj' from the smallest granules, through larger ones, to small drops of fat. The yellow colour of the cortical substance is due to this constituent. 3. The nuclear structures appear uirted into a granular mass. They have an average size of 3 to 4-1000ths of a line, a form which is usually roundish and less frequently oval, and they belong to the variety of the so-called "granular" nuclei; i.e. to those which are formed of a granular mass, and are not vesi- cular. The substance of these nuclei is in- soluble in dilute acids, but is completely dis- solved by the application of potash. Ecker has made the interesting observation, that in the embryo the granular nuclei are no longer to be met with, but that their nuclei are ra- ther vesicles ; that is, that they possess a wall, which encloses a more or less fluid mass, in which are contained one or two small punc- tiform nucleoli. The same condition also obtains in the nuclei of other embryonal tissues. 4. Part of these nuclei are experiencing a transition to cell development, so as to form a constituent of perfect cells. The metamor- phosis to the cell-form begins by a part of the finely granular mass arranging itself around a nucleus. Little clusters are thus formed, each of which contains a nucleus. The outer surface of such a mass then becomes hardened, so that the most super- ficial molecules form a wall or shell, the cell-membrane; thus the cluster becomes a cell. So that from the fine pulverulent molecules proceed both the cell and the cell-membrane. In conformity with this state- ment, a microscopic examination of the ex- pressed contents of the gland-vesicles reveals nuclei, surrounded by irregular flocculi of fine granular substance {b, fig. 542.), and other nuclei, around which this latter tubstance has formed itself into a well-defined, round, or oval mass of 6 to 9-1000ths of a line in dia- meter (c,fig. 542.). Finally, other masses * Compare with this the experiments of H. Mid- ler, in Henle und Pfeufter's Zeitschrift flir ratio- nelle Medizin, 1845, iii. S. 299.SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 832 may be seen, on which an enclosing mem- brane plainly exists. The cell development just described holds good of the supra-renal capsules of all Ver- tebrata. It is thus of very wide distribution. These cells are designated by the name of globules of circumposition (umhullung&kugeln). The so-called granule-cells, or inflammatory globules, belong to the same class ; as also do the globules of fission which originate from the breaking up of the yolk. And I have also observed that the polyhedral pigment cells of the choroid coat of the eye are formed in the same way. Finally (and of immediate interest in this place), I have found that the cells of many other glands are similarly formed; namely, the cells of the tubular gastric glands, the glands of Lieberkuhn and of the large intestine, the glands of Brunner, and probably also those which occur in the uri- nary tubules of the kidney. It may also be conjectured that the cells of other glands will be found to originate in the same way. By a gradual enlargement these cells of the cortical substance are metamorphosed into gland-vesicles (e, Jig. 542.); so that while in the large gland-vesicles cells and nuclei occur in numbers, the smaller ones contain only a solitary nucleus. These smallest gland-vesicks are no wav distinguishable from the larger cells; they also are cells, and the glandular con- tents are exactly those of the cell, and the membrana propria is identical with the cell membrane. The contrast between these vesicles and cells — a contrast upon which Ecker has laid particular stress — is of little importance. According to this observer, the membrana propria of the vesicle is unchanged by solution of potash, while, on the contrary, the membrane of the cell is dissolved by it. But by a repetition of the experiment one may be assured that it is only a dilute solution which leaves the membrana propria unaffected, and that by a more concentrated solution it is dissolved just as much as the cell-membrane. The difference is thus only quantitative, and is in exact conformity with the gradually increasing hardness of the mem- brane. When fine sections of the medullary sub- stance of the human supra-renal capsule are examined with the aid of the microscope, it is seen to be considerably clearer and more transparent than the cortical substance; a circumstance which essentially depends on the fact, that the fatty granules occur more sparingly in the former than in the latter. In Man, and in most of the other Mammalia, it is rendered very distinguishable from the cor- tical substance by the absence of the gland- vesicles. It is found to consist of a basis of fibrous tissue, which is formed by processes that come off from the sheath of the cortical substance, and in which numerous blood-ves- sels and nerves take their course. In the mass of areolar tissue the pulverulent mole- cules above described are also met with ; and besides these, nuclei and cells in different stages of development. Where accessory supra-renal capsules oc- cur, they contain, according to Ecker, the same vesicles ; of which the larger occupy the outside, and the smaller the inside. But the two kinds of substance are not present; the whole tissue answers to the cortical substance of the real supra-renal capsules, and it has a sometimes clearer, sometimes darker,yellowish appearance. The structure just described obtains with little modification in all the Mammalia. It is true that, at present, only the Carnivora, Ruminantia, Solipeda,and Pachydermata, have been examined. Nevertheless, according to these observations, it is tolerably allowable to generalise concerning all the orders of Mammalia. In the Ox, the brown cortical substance is divided by strong bundles of areolar tissue into lobules. The gland-vesicles exhibit no- thing extraordinary, but, amongst the different constituents of their contents, the fatty gra- nules are much more sparingly present than in man. Gerlach* found the glandular vesicles very distinct in the Sheep. The structure of the supra-renal capsules of the Goat and Pig is identical with that seen in the Ox. In the Horse, the gland-vesicles of the cortical substance altogether correspond with those of the human subject. Here also the smaller and more spherical lie on the ex- terior, while the larger and more oval occupy the interior, and offer the tubular disposition already referred to. But their membrana propria is more delicate than in man. In the young Horse the fatty contents of the gland- vesicles are in very small quantity; while, on the other hand, in older animals, it predo- minates so considerably that it quite conceals all the other contents, and renders their exa- mination very difficult. But the medullary substance in the Horse offers a remarkable distinction from that of the other Mammalia : namely, that it, as well as the cortical substance, contains gland- vesicles. These have a variable shape and size; and are round, oval, elongated, or sometimes curved in the shape of a bow. The contents are the same as usual, only it is much poorer in fat than the cortical substance ; and, on this account, appears much clearer. The supra-renal capsules of the Rodentia and Carnivora possess the greatest quantity of fat, and are therefore the most difficult of examination. Notwithstanding this, the white cortical substance of the Rabbit exhibits the usual ar- rangement : and, besides this, the medullary mass not unfrequently presents small circum- scribed collections of fat. Among the beasts of prey, the Dog and Cat have been examined, and in these the nuclei of the contents are with difficulty discover- able, owing to the innumerable quantity of the fatty molecules. The nuclei are here also granular in the older, vesicular in the younger * Handbuch der Gewebelehre des Menschlitlien Korpers, Mainz, 1849, 2tn Lieforung.833 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. animals. A portion of fat not unfrequehtly surrounds the cells of the glandular contents ; and in this manner large dark globules ori- ginate, which completely obscure the enclosed cell. These may especially be seen in the Cat, where they take a clustered arrangement and occupy the limits of the medullary and cor- tical substance. The medullary substance is poor in fat. Hitherto the gland-vesicles have not been made out with certainty in this fatty cortical substance, but they are very distinct in the Hedgehog. It yet remains to us to consider the dispo- sition of the blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves in the supra-renal capsules of the Mammalia. For this purpose we shall select those of Man. Vessels. — In the human subject, each supra-renal capsule is supplied with arterial blood by three trunks: — by an arteria supra- renale superior, which is usually present, and comes off as a branch of the phrenica inferior; an arteria supra-renalis media, which is usu- ally double on each side, and arises from the aorta ; and finally, an arteria supra-renalis in- ferior, which is a branch of the renal artery. The further arrangement of the vascular sys- tem has been especially examined by J. Mid- ler *, and Nagel f, whose results have been recently confirmed by Ecker. J The numerous small arterial trunks having arrived at the outer surface of the supra-renal capsules, take a different distribution. One part of them immediately pierce the sheath of the organ, and enter its substance ; while an- other portion of them courses for a consider- able distance on the outer surface before be- coming lost in the interior. In the interior of the organ itself these small arterial trunks still take a different course. One of these sets of vessels can only be followed for a very short extent in the cortical substance. After a course of scarcely half a line in length, they break up into a capillary network, with long meshes, which encircle the gland vesicles of the cor- tical substance. The other arterial trunks, without giving off any branches, plunge at right angles through the cortical mass into the medullary substance. Here they break up into twigs which, by devious paths, return again into the cortical mass, to end also in a network of capillary vessels. Thus the cor- tical substance possesses a closer capillary network than the medullary mass, a fact which is in conformity with the predominant glan- dular activity of the former stratum. Nagel, in his Essay, has illustrated this distribution of the arterial vessels by beautiful drawings. The veins begin at the common margin of the cortex and medulla. They alone con- stitute almost all the vessels of the latter por- tion, since the smallest branches gradually unite to form larger ones, and these finally join to form the vena supra-renalis, which * Hildebrandt's Anatomie, lierausgegeben von E. H. Weber, 4ter Theil, S. 356. f Loc. cit. j Loc. cit. VOL. IV. occupies the middle of the supra-renal cap- sule; and, as was stated above, is proportion- ally very large. " Were we able," says Nagel, " to exhibit this venous texture isolated from the cellular tissue which receives it, the indi- vidual smaller veins opening into the venous trunk on all sides, and at very acute angles, would render it most suitably comparable to a poplar tree." Usually there is a single vena supra-renalis for each supra-renal capsule. The right supra- renal vein passes immediately from the gland into the vena cava ascendens ; but the left one forms a longer trunk, which opens into the renal vein. But these statements of Nagel are contradicted by others ; for instance, by Krause, according to whom two or three veins generally leave each supra-renal capsule. As far as observations have hitherto gone, this disposition of the vascular system appears to be tolerably constant for all the Mam- malia. The lymphatics of the supra-renal capsules are not yet sufficiently known. According to Arnold, there are superficial and deep ones. In animals slain during the digestive act, Ecker could only find the superficial lym- phatics, so that Arnold's statements would seem to be doubtful. The absorbent trunks of the supra-renal capsules unite with those of the kidneys and the internal sexual organs, and they open into the thoracic duct. The uncommonly rich supply of nerves possessed by the supra-renal capsules consti- tutes a very striking phenomenon, and one which finds no parallel in any cognate organs. In Man, these nerves arise from the caeliac and renal plexuses in the form of numerous and proportionally large trunks. It is chiefly through Ecker that we have become ac- quainted with the further course of the nerves in the interior of the organ. Larger and smaller branches of nerves perforate the cor- tical substance, usually contained in the bun- dles of its areolar tissue, or accompanying its arterial vessels, but giving off no primitive fibres. Only in the medullary substance do the trunks of nerves break up into bundles of fibres. The neighbouring bundles often ex- change their nerve-fibres with each other, so that, in this way, they form a dense micro- scopic nervous tissue It would seem that, in the human subject, no ganglion corpuscles are present in this sympathetic nerve tissue; but, in the Horse, in whom the supra-renal corpuscles are yet richer in nerves than they are in man, some ganglion corpuscles may be seen on the nervous trunks of the tissue. But one must be especially careful against confounding gland-cells of the organ with these ganglion corpuscles, which they super- ficially resemble. This rich supply of nerves seems only to pertain to the supra-renal cap- sules of the Mammalia; in all the other Ver- tebrata, whose supra-renal capsules, as will be forthwith stated, are very similarly constituted, it is completely wanting. On this account, it becomes exceedingly difficult to state what 3 H834 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. object is -fulfilled by this united condition of the nerve fibres. In Birds, the structure of these vascular glands is even more uniform than in the pre- ceding classes. No separation into cortical and medullary substance appears to occur in any bird. A single observation of Meckel's states that in the Cassowary the two kinds of substance are to be distinguished ; but this statement is contradicted by the numerous negative observations of Cuvier, Ecker, Bar- deleben, and Nagel, on all the animals of this class which they have examined, and hence it requires a confirmation. The supra-renal capsules of birds appear of a darkish or clearer yellow colour, which, by the varying amount of blood they contain, tends more or less towards red. They are also enclosed in a sheath of areolar tissue, and exhibit a basis which consists of fibrous tissue and blood- vessels. In this matrix the gland-vesicles lie imbedded throughout the whole thickness of the organ, and they are devoid of any regular arrangement. They are of roundish, oval, pear-shaped, or irregular form. Their size varies from 44 to 56-1000ths of a line, and in the Falco tinnunculus some of them even attain the size of 22-100ths of a line. Their membrana propria is very delicate. The structure here specified may be best wit- nessed in the supra-renal capsules of large birds ; nevertheless, with some care, we may succeed in recognising the gland-vesicles in the smaller members of the class, as, for instance, in the Pigeon. The contents of their gland-vesicles closely resemble those of the Mammalia. There are the same fine pulverulent molecules of a pro- tein compound ; and fatty granules, which are usually in very large quantity, have a yel- lowish colour, and give rise to the tint pos- sessed by the whole organ. Not unfrequently larger yellow drops of fat are visible. Besides these, we come upon the granular nuclei pre- viously mentioned, possessing a size of 22 to 31-10,000ths of a line. Some of these nuclei are also enveloped in a fine granular mass, and exhibit a transition to cells in the mode which we witnessed in the Mammalia. Not unfrequently the nuclei are completely buried in fatty granules, through which they are only visible as clear spots. In the golden Eagle Ecker remarked complete cells filled with fatty granules ; these were probably caused by the usually finely granular cells becoming gradually filled with fat. In many of the gland-vesicles, on the contrary, the fat is re- markably diminished in its proportion to the finely granular substance ; and it has been conjectured by Ecker, and with great pro- bability, that this difference in the amount of fat depends upon the different stages of deve- lopment of the gland-vesicles. In a very young Pigeon I have found scarcely any fat molecules, a fact which has some connection with this statement. The minute anatomy of the supra-renal capsules of the lieptilia is as yet insuffi- ciently known. In the supra-renal capsules of Lacerta agilis, Ecker was with some difficulty able to re- cognise the same condition as that seen in the higher Vertebrata; but the presence of a membrana propria around the gland-Vesicles was especially indistinct. He only remarked masses of a darkish substance. These masses consisted of fatty granules of the nuclei al- ready described, and of granulated globules, which contained a nucleus, and possessed a size of 31 to 44-10,000ths of a line. In the Adder, the obscurity of the contents uncommonly aggravates the difficulty of ex- amining their tabulated supra-renal capsules ; but in the foetal Adder of three inches length, Ecker was able to verify the separate gland- vesicles in the usual manner. Here also nuclei were seen; and, besides these, large pale gland-cells, which could not long resist the action of water. Other cells were com- pletely buried in fatty masses, just as they were seen to be in the carnivorous Mammalia. The arrangement of the vessels of the supra-renal capsules is peculiar in the Snakes, inasmuch as the greater part of the blood is not brought to the organ by means of ar- teries, but by veins. In consequence of this, the supra-renal capsules have a kind of portal venous system, such as is possessed by the kidneys of Reptilia and the liver of Verte- brata. The afferent supra-renal veins arise by two branches from the wall of the body, and from the plexus venosus of the vertebral canal ; and after a tolerably long and isolated course they reach the supra-renal capsules. On an average, the right supra-renal capsule receives two or three branches ; but the left, which is wont to be smaller, only one or two. The arterial blood is brought to the supra- renal capsule by one or two vessels which are branches from the aorta. Both kinds of vessels ramify in the sub- stance of these organs, so as to form a fine capillary network. The efferent supra-renal veins arise from this network in the form of numerous small trunks. They pass from the right supra-renal capsule immediately into the vena cava posterior; but from that of the left side into the inferior cava, and also into the efferent renal vein. In his examinations of the Testudo graeca, Ecker found certain bodies, which he regards as the supra-renal capsules of the Chclonian reptiles. By microscopic examination, they appear as yellow granules which are grouped together in heaps. Each of these is en- closed in a membrana propria, and thus con- stitutes a gland-vesicle. Their contents are altogether identical with those of the Batra- chia, to which we shall next apply ourselves. In the tailless Batrachia, the yellow lobules already described consist of groups of vesicles. Their form varies ; sometimes it is round, sometimes oval, sometimes elongated or irre- gular. The vesicles are always closed, and it is only when they are grouped together that they appear at first sight like blind sacs. Fatty granules constitute the greater part of their contents ; but besides these, the fineSUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 835 3 H 2 granular substance is also present. Clear spots ina}' also be seen glimmering from amidst the contents of the gland, and isolation shows these to be cells of 5 to 9-1000ths of a line in diameter, with finely granular contents and a nucleus. The application of water renders this more visible. Part of these cells are de- void of the cell membrane, but others of them exhibit it very distinctly. Besides these, free nuclei are found ; these are sometimes vesicular and contain a nucleolus, sometimes they appear to be granulated. The nuclei which are included in cells are always of the latter kind. From these microscopic characters of their contents exactly corresponding with those of the higher Vertebrata, the import of these organs as supra-renal capsules is placed be- yond all doubt. The same structure obtains in the tailed Batrachians, only the nuclei and cells are larger, while a part of the latter are com- pletely enclosed in fat. Numerous branches of the afferent renal veins break up anew in the supra-renal capsules, in order to provide it with venous blood, a condition which re- minds us of that seen in the Snakes. The minute anatomy of the supra-renal cap- sules of Fishes is very similar. In the Salmon Ecker found them consisting of separate lo- bules, which are deposited in a loose areolar tissue perforated by vessels, and which, in ad- dition, receive a special covering of this areo- lar tissue. Each lobule is composed of a number of large gland-vesicles, from 5 to 11- lOOths of a line in size, which are surrounded by blood-vessels. Their membrana propria is completely structureless. In their contents we again recognise the pulverulent molecules, separate fatty granules, and vesicular and gra- nular nuclei of 2-1000ths of a line in size. The granular substance is rolled around these nuclei in the manner before described ; so that part of them come to notice as spheres with- out walls, while part are real cells, surrounded by a membrane, and of 7 to 9-]00ths of a line in measurement. It is not unfrequent to find two or three nuclei, instead of one, in their interior. We have remarked an exactly si- milar condition in the supra-renal capsules of the young Pike ; there is the same fibrous coat, giving off processes which pass into the interior, and thus isolate the gland-vesicles, but the supra-renal organs are less divided into lobules than in the fish previously con- templated. The contents of the gland-vesicles vary according to their size. In the supra-renal capsules which are smallest of all, and measure under 9-100ths of a line, there are no gland-vesicles to be seen, but only nuclei : to these we shall im- mediately return. But in supra-renal cap- sules which are somewhat larger, the nuclei are partly included in cells. By a yet further enlargement of these or- gans, the gland-vesicles also appear: they contain fine molecules, fatty granules, and nuclei. These are vesicular, flat, of circular or irregular form, and vary in size from 22 to 30-10,000ths of a line. Each of these nuclei contains a single or double nucleolus. Not unfrequently forms appear which may be con- nected with a division of the nucleus, where it appears cut through the middle, or even incompletely broken up into three parts. Finally, the gland-vesicles also contain cells. By enlarging, these cells experience a gradual transition into new gland-vesicles, which are contained within the larger ones ; so that we may distinguish them into mother- vesicles and endogenous daughter-vesicles, just as often happens in other cells, to wit, those of cartilage. The endogenous vesicles occur in the older ones in variable numbers. The smaller gland-cells contain only a single nucleus ; others possess two or three of them, which sometimes lie closely packed on each other. Finally, in other cells, three, four, five, and more nuclei occur; and in this manner, by an increase in the number of the enclosed nuclei, and at the same time a continual fur- ther extension of the cell membrane, the cells experience a transition into glandular ve- sicles. These conditions, which were first observed by Ecker, and which I can completely con- firm from an examination of the same animal, will quite permit us to conclude as follows regarding the development of the glandular vesicles. In the smallest gland-vesicles a multiplication of nuclei takes place, most pro- bably from those already present, by the me- thod of fission. This multiplication extends itself to free nuclei, as well as to those which are included in cells. In the latter case, the cell-membrane must be more and more ex- tended by the formation of the nuclei; and in this manner the cells of a gland-vesicle them- selves are changed into new endogenous ve- sicles. By this process, the mother vesicle itself is considerably extended ; so that, finally, its membrane comes into contact with the sheath of the supra-renal capsule. Finally, after the membrane of the mother vesicle is destroyed new areolar tissue seems to be developed between the secondary vesicles. In this way the small supra-renal capsules of the Pike experience their growth. In large old Pikes, the process of multipli- cation and growth seems no longer to occur. In their supra-renal capsules, the fibrous foundation is more considerable in quantity, so that by its means the gland-vesicles are more separated from each other. So also in the genus Cyprinus, where a pre- cisely similar structure of the supra-renal cap- sules may be observed, one lights upon con- ditions of nuclei in the gland-vesicles which suffice to prove the transition of gland-cells into gland-vesicles. As to the problematical organs of the Myxine and Petromyzon, the glands which Miillei discovered in the Myxi- noid fishes consist of tufts of small elongated lobules, which are clothed with a kind of cylin- drical epithelium.* Concerning the glands in * See the drawing of this glandular structure in J. Midler's Essay.SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 836 the Petromyzon, Ecker only remarks, that the microscopic constituents do not afford any foundation for the view that they are supra- renal capsules. III. Develojyment. — The supra-renal cap- sules begin at a very early date of fcetal life. In the human subject they appear simul- taneously with the kidneys in the seventh week. The mode of their commencement is not yet understood with certainty. Never- theless there is scarcely any doubt that the statement of Arnold, according to which the supra-renal capsules are formed by a projec- tion of the Wolffian bodies, is erroneous. Most embryologists. as Valentin *, Bischoff j", and others, find that another method of begin- ning obtains, namely, that these organs are developed from an independent blastema, which certainly lies very close to the Wolffian bodies, but has nothing at all to do with them. According to Meckel's observations, both supra-renal capsules constitute at first only a single mass ; and Valentin's researches on the embryo of the Dog and Sheep harmonise with this statement. But, nevertheless, this opinion may be founded on an error. Miiller found that the supra-renal capsules of a large human foetus at the eighth week were plainly double, only they lay very closely together at their inferior part. Bischoff's extensive re- searches on the embryo of Man and other Mammalia, confirm this statement of Midler, and explain the error of Valentin and Meckel. The embryonal form of the supra-renal capsules in man is distinguished from the later condition by its being composed of large lobes; and thus, to a great extent, it resembles its permanent condition in some animals. It is highly singular that the human supra- renal capsule in the earlier period of fcetal life, is not only much larger in proportion to the size of the body than it is at a later stage, but that it also considerably exceeds the kidney in size {fig. 543.). This is shown by Fig. 543. From an embryo of 8 lines in length, a, Supra-renal capsule ; l>, Kidney; c, Sexual gland ; cl, Wolffian bodies. numerous observations of Meckel, Miiller, and others. In a human embryo of the ninth week, Ecker has recently made the same ob- servation. In the embryo of the tenth to the twelfth week, which measures about two inches in length, the kidneys and supra-renal * Handbuch der Entwicklungsgeschichte des Menschen, Berlin, 1835. f Entwicklungsgeschichte der Saugethicre und des Menschen, 1842, S. 291. capsules are for the first time of pretty equal size. While, on the other hand, in the sixth month the kidneys are, as was found by Meckel, already about double the size of the supra- renal capsules, and their weight is to that of these latter as five to two. And as this com - parative diminution of the supra-renal cap- sules proceeds further, the proportions by weight are in the mature embryo as three to one. And even beyond this time, they expe- rience a continual diminution, so that finally, in the adult, the supra-renal capsule is only l-28th the size of the kidney. Strange to say, this extraordinary size of these organs during the fcetal period, does not obtain in the other Mammalia. In the earliest period of their embryonal life, the kidneys have always been found considerably larger than the supra-renal capsules. In them both organs appear to grow in precisely equal pro- portion to each other, so that their (compa- rative) weight remains the same in the adult animal as in the foetus. According to Ecker, the supra-renal glands of the new-born kitten are l-5Cth to l-t>0th the size of the urinary glands. So also the other classes of Vertebrata seem to accord with the Mammalia in this re- spect. At least Ecker observed, in the em- bryo and adult animal of the Coluber natrix, the same relative proportion of size between the kidney and supra-renal capsule. If we regard the situation of the supra-renal capsules in the animal kingdom, we shall find a different condition in the different classes. It is well known that the Wolffian bodies begin in the embryo at a very early period, and that these, from their structure and func- tion, must be regarded as the kidneys of the embryo ; so that the name of " primordial or original kidneys," may be applied to them with all accuracy. Now these primordial kidneys have a very different duration in the different classes of Vertebrata. In Fishes they remain as the urinary glands during the whole of life ; since in them, as Baer and Rathke found, an organ similar to the kidneys of the higher Vertebrata is never developed. The kidneys of Fishes are, therefore, pri- mordial kidneys. But in the three higher classes of Vertebrata the fact is found to be otherwise. Here the primordial kidneys pertain to only a part of the foetal life, and then make way for the true kidneys, which are situated beneath the supra- renal capsules. Therefore, the supra-renal capsules of fishes are placed on the Wolffian bodies, while in the other Vertebrata they are in connection with the kidneys. In Man, in whom the supra-renal capsules are at first uncommonly large, the primordial kidneys disappear remarkably early, so that in the second month they have vanished even to the smallest relics. The development of the tissues of these organs is as yet most incompletely known ; at present we have only a single statement of Ecker's respecting it. In a human embryo of twelve weeks, this anatomist found a very837 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. distinct cortical and medullary substance. But only part of the morphological consti- tuents were present ; viz., the elementary granules, fat, and nuclear structures. Cells, with or without a membrane, were only sparingly found ; and gland-vesicles were altogether absent. The embryos of other Mammalia exhibited the same results. In the foetus of an ox of U feet in length, the vesicles were for the first time detected; and in this instance, as in those of the mature animals previously described, the gland-vesicles were, according to Ecker's opinion, developed from enlarged cells. In any case it is exceedingly interesting to observe, that in spite of the very early found- ation of the supra-renal capsule, this organ seems to rest for a considerable time ; since, before their gland-vesicles are developed, we cannot ascribe any activity to the supra-renal capsules. But in man, these vesicles are only developed when the period at which the supra-renal capsules attain their greate.it bulk is long passed. IV. Physiology. — Finally we apply our- selves to the functional relations of the supra- renal capsules. Unfortunately, as regards the activity of the glands of blood-vessels, they all veil themselves in an impenetrable ob- scurity. The recent vast strides of Physiology have passed over them without leaving any traces ; the last ten years having only brought some new hypotheses concerning the function of these organs, and very doubtfully enriched the already great number of older conjectures. It is not the aim of this essay either to answer or to enumerate all that physicians of earlier and later times have imagined as the possible function of the supra-renal capsules. These conjectures, for the most part ephemeral, may be properly left to the history of ana- tomico-physiological science ; and since we willingly disclaim the intention to come for- ward with a new hypothesis, we will only call attention to some points of this mass of matter. Now that the minute structure of the supra- renal capsules is known, it becomes even more important to dissent from the opinion of Cuvier. He attributed to the supra-renal capsules pretty much the same function as the kidneys," because these two organs have much similarity with each other, both in their form, and in the tissues of which they are com- posed." At present we know how great is the diversity between the tissues of the two organs. Besides, the want of an excretory duct is another fact completely passed over 03' Cuvier. The opinion of Meckel, that the supra-renal capsules stand in dependance with the sexual functions, rests on just as little foundation, and has been already confuted at length by Nagel in his work. So also the conjecture of Bergmann*and others —accord- ing to which the supra-renal capsules stand in a very close relation to the nervous system * Bergmaim, Dissertatio de glandulis supra- renalibus, Gottingse, 1839. of the foetus — is equally erroneous. We will willingly admit the correctness of the observ- ation, that in brainless monsters the supra- renal capsules are generally deficient ; but we arc forced to add, that we cannot annex any distinct notions to this close relation to the nervous system. Besides, this would suppose that the function of the supra-renal capsule differed in the foetus and in the adult animal ; since certainly no one would seriously defend such a relation of their function in the latter case. And the support which this view seems to receive from the structure of the supra-renal capsules, is likewise only a fallacious one. At one time, attention was drawn to the great richness of the supra-renal capsules in nerves, without reflecting that this is the case in only one out of the four classes of vertebrate ani- mals : and in the same way, the superficial like- ness possessed by the gland-cells and ganglion corpuscles was adduced in order to make out the supra-renal capsule as a kind of ganglion. This hypothesis was put aside by the dis- covery of the gland-vesicles. And especially we would briefly remark, that all those theories which ascribe to the supra-renal capsules a special import during embryonal life, have ori- ginated from contemplating them in the human foetus, in whom they areexecedingly large. Had the supra-renal capsules of other animals been kept in view, those opinions could scarcely have been taken up ; and the special size of these organs in the human embryo would have been recognised for that which it really is, an anomalous, isolated condition, which pos- sibly stands in a causal relation with the swift disappearance of the Wolffian bodies. And, as we have already remarked, even apart from this, the absence of the gland-vesicles from the supra-renal capsules of the small embryo is a fact which must not pass un- noticed. We will, therefore, only attempt to answer such physiological questions concerning the supra-renal capsules which are possibly sus- ceptible of solution, and defer their full under- standing to the future. We will see whether the supra-renal cap- sules in general can be called glands, and how far they correspond with the other glands of blood-vessels, with the thyroid, thymus, and spleen. Anil then we may answer the ques- tion, " whether the supra-renal capsules ge- nerally eliminate a glandular secretion, and whether this secretion is to be regarded as similar or diverse in the whole of the vascular glands ?" Microscopic anatomy has taught us to re- cognise three kinds of form under which glands are developed in the higher animals. The first is a fine tube or canal of different length; the second is a small globular or elongated sac, which is open at one end ; and the third form is that of a globular and com- pletely closed vesicle. A very delicate struc- tureless membrane, the membrana propria, forms the frame-work of all these glands ; and it is distinguished by its insolubility in dilute alkalies. On its exterior, it is surrounded by 3 h 383S SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. a network of capillaries, while it includes within its interior, glandular contents in very diverse forms. These contents consist, in general, of elementary granules, of an albu- minous material, of fatty granules and small drops of fat, and of nuclei and cells in the most variable quantities. Cells, which are the highest development of glandular contents, are not always found : more frequently only nuclei are noticed. It will be recollected that in speaking of the contents of the supra-renal capsules, we have stated that the development of cells occurs by the method of cireumposition of a globular membrane, and the same method obtains in a number of the glands. The first two of the three forms of glands frequently occur isolated, and thus exhibit microscopic glandules of the greatest sim- plicity ; as for instance the stomach glands of Mammalia, the glands of Lieberkuhn, the cu-. taneous glands of the Frog. In other instances, glandular tubes or sacs are connected to each other in very variable number, and thus form the larger glands. In this way the kidneys and testicles originate from tubes ; while from sacculi are formed the multitude of clustered glands, as those of Brunner, the salivary glands, and the pancreas. The first two forms of glandular structure have no further interest as regards our present object; but the case is very different with re- spect to the third or vesicular form. The gland-vesicles have a very diverse size, ranging from microscopic dimensions to a quarter, a half, or even a whole line or more. Their shape is always spherical, so that their membrana propria encloses a globular cavity, which contains, suspended in a fluid, all the different constituents of gland-contents pre- viously spoken of. In very numerous experi- ments I have never found vesicles of this kind further divided by ensheathing membranes. Generally the united gland-vesicles are in- laid in the fibrous tissue of the particular mucous membrane of the body; they are sometimes in greater, sometimes in smaller quantity, so that great differences, both in- dividual and generic, may be noticed in this respect. In many places they occur with greater frequency, so as to constitute the rule, and have therefore received a special name. For instance, the glandulae solitariae of the intestine, and the lenticular glands of the mucous membrane of the stomach, belong to this category ; while in other cases more than one or even many vesicles of this kind are grouped together to form a glandular body of some extent. Amongst such aggregations may here be enumerated the Peyerian vesicles, which form a single layer of this kind in the mucous membrane of the intestine. We find the same grouping in the ovary, where these vesicles are called " Graafian," in honour of their discoverer. But here they are some- what more widely separated from each other by the thickness of a solid fibrous basis, or by the so-called stroma; and they enclose, beside the usual glandular contents, a peculiar body, the primitive egg or ovum. The physiological relations of the gland- vesicles, and especially their duration and origin, are as yet little known. The facts may probably be stated as follows. The gland-vesicles arise from cells which enlarge, so that the cell-membrane becomes the wall of the vesicle, and its contents form those of the vesicle also. At least I have ob- served exactly this occurrence to take place in formation of vesicles in a fish of very low development which inhabits our brook ( Ammoccetes branchialis). In this fish a num- ber of glands of this kind may be found at the dilated part of the intestinal canal, on both sides of it near the spiral fold : these remain tolerably small, although they experience con- siderable variations of diameter. They are densely filled with large, pale, smooth nuclei, of oval or roundish form, the number of which is greater or smaller according to the size of the vesicle. Beside these are seen in the tissue of the wall of the intestine separate cells, which enclose two nuclei in no way distin- guishable from those of the gland-vesicles. From these cells they pass, by all intermediate gradations, to the large vesicles. If one may generalise on this observation, it may be stated therefrom, in accordance with the proposition mentioned above, that the shut gland-vesicles proceed from cells. The gland-vesicles in the mucous membranes of the Mammalia are very unfavourable objects for examination ; so that, unfortunately, in spite of many attempts, I have not been so lucky as to observe their de- velopment. So also I am unable to state in what way the multiplication of nuclei takes place, whether by a fission of the nuclei already present, or whether new nuclei arise inde- pendently of the old ones in the fluid of the gland. But I conjecture that the latter is the case. By their further increase of size, the gland- vesicles come to lie more on the surface of the substance in which they are imbedded. But the membrana propria does not possess an unlimited extensibility, so that a period arrives when it can no longer withstand the contents, and is burst by them. This rending occurs at the place of least resistance, namely, at the upper and most external part, and en- gages not only the membrana propria of the gland-vesicle, but also the thin layer of fibrous tissue present superficially to this. By the occurrence of this so-called dehiscence of the gland-vesicles, its fluid contents become effused amongst the other constituents. This process has long been known to occur in the Graafian follicle of the ovary ; but it may also be seen with the greatest distinctness in the vesicles of the mucous membranes, as well in the separate as in the Peyerian glands. The burst gland-vesicle is thus brought into connection with the outer world, and now resembles a vvidc-bcllied and short-necked flask : it has thus suddenly become converted into a small sac, such as we have already found as a constituent of the glands treated of as belonging to the second variety. After their dehiscence, the gland-vesiclesSUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. 839 appear to behave differently. Part of them by bursting arrive at the end of their career. They do not become distended with secretion a second time, but the gland-vesicles cease to exist as such in consequence of further meta- morphosis. The ovary, the vesicles of which disappear by the formation of a corpus luteum, affords a proof of the occurrence of this pro- cess. While, on the contrary, other gland- vesicles seem to close again, and to become distended with new secretion, in order to their going through the process for a second or perhaps a third time. It is exceedingly diffi- cult to come at the truth respecting this matter, but an examination of the Peyerian glands may afford us some help in the investigation. Each Peyerian patch consists of but a single layer of gland-vesicles, which in the adult ap- pear all to be at pretty much the same stage of development. No second row of unde- veloped vesicles is ever found beneath this layer, such as might be supposed to serve as a compensation for those which have burst ; so that a Peyerian patch of glands, after all the vesicles had burst, would necessarily dis- appear, if no closure of the vesicles followed, unless indeed a power existed to develop a new group of vesicles at some other point. Now although the Peyerian glands of Man and Mammalia certainly show individual varieties in number and extent, yet these appear too small to prove a destruction of the Peyerian vesicles after the mariner of the Graafian fol- licles of the ovary. Besides this, I have never been able to remark the least appearance which could lead me to imagine a new development of the glandular patches. Moreover, it is a well ascertained fact, that in many Mammalia certain Peyerian gland-patches show a con- stant position and size at all periods. To this category belongs a very large Peyerian patch which exists in the rabbit at the point where the ileum opens into the large intestine. Such structures will scarce admit of any other conclusion than that the gland-vesicles re- close themselves after their dehiscence. From these observations, which in part de- pend on researches not yet published, we shall be able to come to a decision respecting the glandular nature of the supra-renal cap- sules. In them the same gland-cells appear ; the same membrana propria, capable of with- standing alkalies. Exteriorly this issurrounded by capillaries, and interiorly it contains the same mass, consisting of molecules of a protein substance, fatty granules, nuclei, and cells de- veloped by circumposition of a membrane. We also find a development of gland-vesicles from cells identical with that which was met with in the Ammocoetes. The multiplication of the nuclei here occurs by the method of fission. And since, in the supra-renal capsules, these undeveloped gland-vesicles occur in predomi- nant quantity, we may, therefore, well imagine that the old gland-vesicles are destroyed in these organs, in which they undergo dehis- cence. But their contents are not extruded outwardly, as are those of the gland-vesicles previously described, but into the fibrous frame- work of the organ, in which they exist in the fluid form, and from which they are subse- quently received into the vascular system either by immediate or mediate resorption. We are therefore correct in regarding the supra-renal capsules as glandular organs, and their function as secretory; and any hypo- thesis which ascribes to them a function other than secretory, may be safely considered erro- neous. If we now address ourselves to a comparison of the structure of the supra-renal capsules with that of other vascular glands, we shall see how great a resemblance obtains. Unfortunately, we do not possess such ex- perimental researches regarding all of them as those which Ecker has published in his work on the supra-renal capsules. Only the thymus gland has found an accurate observer in Simon.* Nevertheless, we already know thus much, that in two of the three other vascular glands, viz., in the thymus and thy- roid glands, a similar structure obtains. Bar- deleben-)- was the first to observe what Ecker J, Gcrlach§, Schaffher||, and others confirmed, that in the thyroid gland gland- vesicles occur grouped in masses, imbedded in a loose cellular tissue, and surrounded by blood-vessels. In Man, they are seen with some difficulty; but are more easily made out in most of the Mammalia, and best in Birds and Reptilia. These vesicles, which attain a size varying from G-lOOOths to 5-100ths of a line, begin as cells which mea- sure 5 to 10-1000ths of a line, and which are connected with them by all the transi- tional forms. Suspended in a fluid which occupies their interior, are varying numbers of elementary granules of an albuminous material ; and besides these, fatty granules, nuclei of 2 to 3000ths of a line, and finally, cells with one or more nuclei. In the earlier periods of foetal life the vesicles are not to be met with ; but their place is entirely oc- cupied by cells, — a condition exactly similar to that which was met with in examining the supra-renal capsules. So also the gland-vesicles of the thyroid appear after some time to be destroyed, and their contents resorbed. This is shown by the fact, that frequently only younger and undeveloped forms of these are to be met with in the adult animal ; while in other in- stances, the fully developed vesicles occur in excessive numbers. Some distinction between the thyroid and supra-renal capsules, although not an important one, may possibly be de- duced from the fact, that in most of the Mam- malia, the nuclei and cells are ranged as an epithelial stratum on the inner surface of the vesicles, so that the remainder of their cavity * A Physiological Essay on the Th\-nius Gland, London, 1845. \ Observations de glandularam ductu excretorio carentium structure, Berolini, 1841. J Loc. cit. § Loc. cit. || Henle und Pfeuffer's Zeitschrift fiir rationelle Medizin, 1849. 3 II 4;810 SUPRA-RENAL CAPSULES. is filled with a more or less clear fluid. Never- theless, in Man, the gland-vesicles are generally completely filled with the morphological con- stituents of their contents. As regards the thymus, we have lately had Simon's researches extended by Ecker, Ger- lach, and Schaffher. The gland-vesicles here likewise enclose similar contents. The quan- tity of the elementary granules seems to be very variable, and nuclei form the greater part of the contents. In general, cells occur but very sparingly. According to Simon, their number is increased by involution of the organ, in which case, also, fat molecules are wont to appear in place of the elementary granules. As to the gland-vesicles, they deviate from those of the vascular glands hitherto described. In the embryo of the Adderand of Birds, Ecker saw many completely shut gland-vesicles, which everywhere passed into sacculi by pouchings of their membrana propria. In the human thymus, and that of Mammalia generally, only a few vesicles of this kind were found, and the tunics of these exhibited the same condition. Thus the thymus gland exhibits a similarity with the clustered glands ; but is distinguished from these by the want of an excretory duct. And these differences of the gland-vesicles, toge- ther with the great number of the nuclear structures, somewhat distinguish the thymus from the supra-renal and thyroid glands. The structure of the spleen is even more different, — if it be allowable to decide upon this organ, which is so uncommonly diffi- cult of examination, from a few observations of a somewhat contradictory tendency. It is only the well-known Malpighian corpuscles which can be regarded as glandular struc- tures. In fact, this opinion would seem to be correct, since Ecker found a delicate mem- brane enclosing the vesicles. Nevertheless, lately, an opinion has been put forth on many sides, and based on continuous research, that the Malpighian corpuscles are not closed vesicles, but stand in connection with the lymphatics, so as to constitute only vesicular dilatations of these vessels. This view, which is maintained by Gerlach and Schaffher, is especially corroborated by the fact, that the contents of the splenic vesicles differ from those of the other vascular glands, and closely approximate to those of the lymphatic ves- sels. Thus we remark in their contents, cell nuclei in very predominant quantify, the dia- meter of which amounts to 2-1000ths of a line. These nuclei appear sometimes smooth, sometimes granular ; they often exhibit one or two nucleoli, while in other instances they have none. Roundish cells of 4- to 5-1000ths of a line, and closely surrounding a nucleus, may also be remarked in sparing quantities. The above-mentioned relation of the Malpi- ghian corpuscles to the lymphatic vessels is probably supported by another circumstance. Another cell formation may be found in al- most every spleen, and certainly in the splenic vesicles also. They are large, globular cells, measuring from 5 to 10-lOOOths of a line, and with contents of a very different kind ; so that from this fact one might conjecture that they form a number of very different struc- tures, which, however, are connected with each other by transitional forms. Thus a part of these cells contain more or less dark elementary granules ; another part enclose larger yellowish, or yellowish brown and tuberculated corpuscles ; while finally, other cells contain, with the latter corpuscles, one or many completely developed blood corpus- cles. This group of cells is susceptible of a double interpretation. In the first place, effused blood corpuscles may be enclosed by a cell membrane, and may be broken up into elementary granules in its interior. This view has been taken by Kolliker*, and is supported by pathological appearances. But the process may be exactly the reverse ; the blood corpuscles may be developed in the interior of the cells, and then, after the burst- ing of the cell wall, become free. And should this latter view, which is especially maintained by Gerlach-)-, ultimately turn out to be correct, then we shall have in the Malpighian vesicles of the spleen a new development of blood corpuscles, just such as occurs after another scheme, in the other district of the lymph and chyle system. So that the spleen would be an organ especially serving for the develop- ment of blood corpuscles, and the old ex- planation set forth by Hewson would be the correct one. But if the process be that which Kolliker supposes, the spleen will exercise the function of destroying the blood corpuscles. In any case, it is worthy of notice, that no such cells containing blood corpuscles occur in the other vascular glands. Gerlach could not discover them in the thymus gland, and they would scarcely have escaped Ecker's careful observations of the supra-renal capsules. So likewise, in a number of examinations of supra-renal capsules, it is impossible to find the least trace of their presence. Therefore by all this the spleen is greatly distinguished from the other vascular glands. Such great differences of structure and contents will not allow us to attribute a like function and a like secretion to all these organs. Certainly we cannot at all state of what kind these differ- ences of secretion are, since the materials prepared by these vascular glands are, as far as regards their composition, completely ne- glected : but that such differences must exist, I think microscopic research will quite warrant us in saying. In this respect the thyroid gland and supra-renal capsule agree most nearly together, since in general terms, there is a great correspondence in their struc- ture. And, as the spleen is the widest se- parated from them, so it is not unlikely that future research may remove it from amongst the vascular glands. Since the chemical constitution of the se- cretion is unknown to us, we are unable to * Vide Landis's Dissertation, apparently under Kblliker's direction, Beitrage zur Lehre iiber die Verrichtungen der Milz, Zurich, 1847. See also the article SrnjEN. f Loc. cit.SWEAT. 841 state cither the object of the vascular glands in general, or that of the supra-renal capsules in particular. Pathological .study also has, up to the present time, failed to afford any- thing which would allow any safe conclu- sion to be drawn concerning the function of the supra-renal capsules. By their concealed situation, they elude the experiments of the physiologist; besides this, they are so small, that their secretion can scarcely have any very sudden and visible influence on the vegetative life of the body. So that even by such an eager operative interference as the extirpation of this gland, the wished-for result might scarcely be obtained. I therefore repeat, that at present we are completely in the dark as to the function of the supra-renal capsules ; we know not at all in what way they operate, and on this account all references of the supra-renal capsules to this or that organ — such as have so often been made — are altogether empty and worth- less. We may see at a glance that it would be just as correct to assign a relation of the supra-renal capsules to the eye or ear, as to the sexual or urinary organs. Ecker, who, in opposition to our view, re- gards the secretion of all the vascular glands as one and the same, keeps its contents of fat and protein compound especially in view, and conjectures that all the vascular glands are adapted to the formation from the blood of a secretion which is rich in protein and fat, and which being subsequently retaken into the current of the blood, in this manner benefits nutrition. But apart from the fact, that one cannot see why such a fluid should take this round-about way through the vascular glands ; apart from this, the quantity of protein com- pounds in the secretion of all the vascular glands of the body, even if we take this at the highest estimate, is far too small to render any enrichment of albuminous materials which the body could obtain in this way other than a very inconsiderable one. The want of an excretory duct affords certainly this informa- tion, that the secretion prepared by the vesicles of the vascular glands is again received into the blood ; but even this notion has connected with it much that is obscure and uncertain. The difference of the function of the vascular glands is yet further upheld by the circum- stance that their vital duration and activity is different. The function of the thymus is the first to wane ; that of the supra-renal capsules seems likewise much diminished in more advanced age; while, on the contrary, the activity of the spleen endures for the whole life. These organs experience an excessive deposit of fat in their vesicles, and by this means gradually disappear.

In con- * The Editor begs to make his acknowledgments to his friend Dr. Brinton for this translation from the German MS. of Professor Frey. sidering this subject it is important to make the distinction between sweat and that ex- halation which is constantly, and at the same time insensibly, excreting from the healthy skin. The latter is the manifestation of a function indispensably necessary for the con- tinuance of life ; while sweat may be regarded merely as an occasional result, and as pro- ducing on the surface certain excretive pro- ducts which under ordinary conditions only appear in small proportion on the skin, and find their more natural exit from the organism through other channels. It is true that sweat contains among its constituents the ordinary products of the insensible perspiration, but it also contains other matters of a solid kind which do not appear in a fluid form unless cutaneous excitement be brought about, and which in cold weather and in the case of in- dolent, inactive persons, adhere to the cuticle, and are gradually rubbed or washed off. These solid matters are not volatile at the ordinary temperature of the skin, and there- fore will not pass off from the body in mate- rial quantity by any amount of perspiration. They become constituents of sweat, however, inasmuch as they dissolve in the water which, under exercise or owing to excessive tempe- rature, appears on the surface. Thus sweat is constituted of the ordinary aqueous pro- ducts of the natural perspiration, which ap- pearing in large quantity ceases to be va- porised, and in addition it contains those cutaneous secretions which the water dis- solves, but which, when an animal does not sweat, appear in less quantity, and adhere undissolved to the surface. As the ordinary cutaneous transpiration forms an important part of sweat, 1 shall proceed to consider it before entering on the more immediate subject of the present article. In the healthy human subject, a portion of water is constantly finding its way to the surface, and under ordinary conditions is va- porised nearly as fast as it is secreted. Some difference is observed in individuals in this respect, however, so that we observe some whose skins are constantly moist, while others, though in perfect health, have the skin almost always dry, yet doubtless performing its ordi- nary function. Perhaps the most agreeable proportion of perspiration, and that which we should regard as approaching more nearly to the normal quantity, is that which maintains a certain moisture on the surface sufficient to impart an agreeable softness to the touch, and scarcely to convey the idea of moisture. Many attempts have been made to determine the quantity of the cutaneous transpiration, and perhaps nothing has ever been attempted so unpromising in result. It is almost certain, indeed, that we do not transpire equally during any two minutes of the day, and on no two days alike. Sanctorius, the Venetian physician, whose aphorisms contain much valuable matter, too much neglected by the physiologists of the present day, made lengthened experiments on perspiration. The insensible perspiration has,SWEAT. 842 indeed, been termed " Sanctorian" in honour of him. This subject, curiously enough, received some attention from the merry monarch Charles the Second, who instituted many ex- periments on the subject. Among other less exalted, but probably more trustworthy ob- servers, may be mentioned Dodart, Keil, Ro- binson, Home, and Linings, and of later date Lavoisier and Seguin. According to an ex- periment of Home, the perspiration during the twelve hours of night varies from 12 to 18 oz., and in 23^ hours the discharge amounted to 3 lbs. 3j oz. On another occasion, however, the amount was only 2 lbs. 6i oz. Keil states the medium quantity of perspiration to be 31 oz. only. Robinson states the amount for summer to be 27 oz., and in winter 30 oz. daily. Hartmann, in Germany, makes the daily amount of perspiration 45 to 40 oz. Dodart, in France, gives 40 oz. 3 dr. 26 gr. for summer, and 26 oz. 46 gr. for winter. Sanctorius found that in the warm humid air of Venice, having taken 8 lbs. of ingesta, the perspiration in the 24 hours amounted to 5 lbs., the faeces to 4 oz., and the urine to 69 oz. The observations made by Linings, in the climate of South Carolina, bear importantly on this subject. He found that while perspir- ation, as might be expected, was most abund- ant in the warm weather of summer, the urine diminished proportionally, and that the converse pertained for the winter. He ob- served the perspiration to exceed the urine during seven months, and the urine the pers- piration during five months of the twelve. The largest proportion of urine observed was 143 oz., which occurred in December. The largest proportion of perspiration was 130 oz., and was observed in September. The ingesta were to the perspiration as 2-18 to 1. The perspiration of the whole year was to the urine as 1 to 1*08. These experiments differ from those of Sanctorius and Rye, in showing that the urine exceeds the perspiration even in a hot climate. On reviewing all that has been done by various experimenters, it appears doubtful whether, even in warm climates, the cutaneous exhalation exceeds that of the urine, and we ought most probably to regard it as consider- ably below the quantity stated by Sancto- rius. It must be remembered that, as in the experiments described above, the per- spiration is estimated from the loss sustained by the body during a given period, alter subtracting the weight of faeces and urine discharged ; we have the pulmonary exhalation therefore included in the account, as well as the cutaneous. Mr. Cruikshank made experiments which are free from this source of error. He placed his hand in a glass jar, making it air-tight by means of bladder fixed round his wrist and also bound tight to the mouth of the jar. He assumed that his hand presented a surface ^\jth that of the whole surface of the body, and from that datum arrived at the conclusion that the exhalation from the skin was 7 lbs. 6 oz. in the 24 hours, which, under exercise, would amount to 12 lbs. Mr. Abernethy made an experiment very similar to the above, but according to his cal- culation, the exhalation for 24 hours would amount only to 2£ lbs. This extraordinary difference may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that Mr. Abernethy continued his experiment six hours, and Mr. Cruikshank only one hour, and such being the case, the exhalation may have nearly ceased some length of time before six hours had elapsed, owing to the extremely moist atmosphere in which Mr. A.'s hand was placed. Cruikshank, it will be seen, would have to multiply by 24, and Abernethy by 4 only for the result u{ 24 hours. Thus the former would magnify the excess (obtained by the first hour affording a dryer atmosphere) into an important quan- tity. Lavoisier and Seguin have made excellent experiments with a view of ascertaining the amount of cutaneous exhalation. They en- closed the whole body in a varnished silk bag. There was a small opening to this, which was carefully cemented around the mouth of the subject of experiment. Thus ail the mois- ture from the lungs escaped, while the cuta- neous exhalation was confined in the bag. By weighing the body before and after leaving the bag, the total loss from skin and lungs was ascertained. The amount of loss by the lungs was ascertained by weighing the person before he got into the bag and immediately before he left it. After a long series of ex- periments conducted in this manner, Lavoi- sier and Seguin found that the mean loss by pulmonary and cutaneous exhalation amounted to 18grs. per minute, or 2 lbs. 13 oz. in 24 hours. Of this the pulmonary discharge was 15 oz., and the cutaneous exhalation 1 lb. 14 oz. This they regard, then, as the mean amount of daily perspiration. The greatest quantity of matter perspired in a minute, was 26'25 grs. troy, and the minimum 9 grs. Ex- halation is increased by fluids, but not by solid food. It is at its minimum during meals, and at its maximum during digestion. Under certain conditions vapour has been observed to escape from the body in very great quantity. Thus, Haller observed, when in the subterraneous caverns of Clausthal and Rammelsberg, that a distinct cloud or smoke could be perceived rising from the naked human figure. Some diversity of opinion has prevailed among experimenters as to the gases which pass off from the body in company with the water, by the function of insensible perspira- tion. Abernethy and Mackensie detected carbonic acid, and Collard de Martigny found nitrogen in addition. These gases appear in variable quantity, and are sometimes alto- gether absent. After muscular exertion, and after meals, they appear in great abundance. According to Trousset, Bairuel, and Ingen- houss, nitrogen is sometimes exhaled without carbonic acid. Monsieur Collard found that the cutaneous transpiration contained mostSWEAT. 843 nitrogen when an animal diet had been used, while carbonic acid prevailed when vege- table food was taken. This experimenter also satisfied himself that carbonic acid was evolved from the skin in a gaseous form, and need not be the result of oxydation of carbon by con- tact with air, as he was able to collect it over water from the skin. The insensible cuta- neous transpiration may be regarded then as composed of aqueous vapour, carbonic acid, and nitrogen gases ; the two latter not only varying in proportion like the first, but probably being sometimes absent, even in health, according to conditions of the organ- ism, which are not yet sufficiently investi- gated in relation to this subject. When, under the conditions referred to at the commencement of this article, the sur- face becomes covered with sweat, the various matters passing away from the skin by exces- sive secretion have been examined by che- mists with the following results : — The total solid matters passing away from the unexcited skin have been calculated at about 7 to 8 scruples in the 24 hours, but the very nature of the inquiry prevents any great reliance being placed in such results. When sweat is collected, as was done by Simon, from persons subjected to the vapour bath, it appears as a turbid fluid, yielding a deposit by standing. This deposit consists of epithelium scales. The clear fluid was found by Simon to possess a specific gravity of 1003 to 1004. This result, however, must be modified continually by the water condensed on the surface from the aqueous vapour of the bath. The fluid was acid, but only very slightly so, and in the course of twenty-four hours it became neutral. The acidity of the sweat was therefore dependent on the pre- sence of carbonic acid. Ammonia was evolved from it after exposure. Simon analysed his own sweat. He found it to develop an odour of ammonia, and could detect that gas by testing with the vapour of hydrochloric acid. On evaporation, the peculiar smell of animal extractive matter was observed. When the dry matter was triturated with potash, ammo- nia came off. Sulphuric acid added to ano- ther portion developed sulphurous acid at first, and afterwards produced a strong odour of acetic acid. In one instance observed by Simon, the sweat gave off the odour of butyric acid so strongly as to leave no doubt on his mind of the presence of that substance. From various experiments, Simon concludes normal sweat to contain — 1. Matters soluble in ether: traces of fat, sometimes including butyric acid. 2. Matters soluble in alcohol: alcoholic extractive, free lactic or acetic acid, chloride of sodium, lactates and acetates of potash and soda, lactate or hydrochlorate of ammonia. 3. Matter soluble in water: aqueous ex- tractive, phosphate of soda, and, occasionally, alkaline sulphate. 4. Matters insoluble in water: desqua- mated epithelium, phosphate of lime, and peroxide of iron. Berzelius examined and analysed sweat as obtained from the forehead. He found it to contain much the same substances that exist in the acid juice of flesh. He states chloride of sodium to be in excess, however. The skin is certainly an active excreter of free phosphoric and lactic acids, and assists the urine in its important office of discharging these acids from the system. Landerer has lately shown the presence of urea in healthy sweat, and it is probably by decomposition of this substance that collected sweat becomes ammoniacal. Thus, the skin would appear, under varying conditions, to assume the excre- tory duties of the lungs and kidneys, and we are almost constrained to regard its function as supplementary as well as complimentary to that of respiration and the excretion of urine. Anselmino has, perhaps, made the best analyses of the sweat. According to him one hundred parts of the solid matters of sweat contain — 1. Substances insoluble in water and alcohol (chiefly calcareous salts) 2-0 2. Aqueous extractive matter (re- garded as salivary matter by An- selmino, according to Berzelius without sufficient reason), and sulphates - - - -21*0 3. Spirituous extractive (chloride of sodium and osmazome) - - 48"0 4. Alcoholic extractive (osmazome, lactic acid and its salts, regarded by Anselmino as acetic acid and acetates) .... 20 0 In order to obtain the solid matters of the sweat, Anselmino collected it in the vapour bath by means of clean sponges. The fluid so obtained was filtered, and the water dis- tilled off. Acetate of ammonia was found in the receiver. Simon considers acetic acid to be a constant constituent of the sweat, and with Berzelius considers hydrochlorate of am- monia to be a normal component of the fluid. Simon, though agreeing in the general with the results of Anselmino, failed to detect sulphates in freshly collected sweat. He found it, however, in the incinerated residue, from which he infers that some of the con- stituents of sweat contain sulphur. The following is Anselmino's analysis of sweat in 1000 parts: — Water _ - - - 995-00 987-500 Epidermis and calca- reous salts - - -10 -250 Aqueous extractive matter (sulphates) 1-05 2-625 Spirituous extractive, chlorides of sodium and potassium - 2-40 6-000 Alcoholic extractive, acetates,lactates,and free acetic acid - 1*45 3-625 In the ash of the dried residue of sweat, Anselmino found carbonate, sulphate, and phosphate of soda, chloride of sodium, phos- phate and carbonate of lime, with traces of iron. In every 100 parts of dry matter ofSWEAT. 844 sweat, he found [22'9 of these fixed saline matters. But little is known concerning the sweat of the lower animals. Fourcroy analysed the white powder which hangs to the coat of the horse when sweat has dried upon it ; he de- tected urea in that substance, but Anselmino could not. According to the latter chemist, the white matter is made up of the following constituents : — 1. A substance of acid reaction, with an alkaline lactate or acetate. 2. Extractive matter possessing the odour of the animal; and chloride of sodium. 3. A brown extractive matter soluble in water and precipitable by infusion of galls. Alkaline chloride and sulphate. The ash consisted of alkaline sulphates and chlorides, but no carbonates or phos- phates ; phosphate of lime and magnesia, with traces of oxide of iron. Sweat in disease. — The sweat in disease has been submitted to examination in a very unsatisfactory manner, but few analyses having been made. Dr. Piutti, of Elgersburg, made analyses of the sweat obtained from three patients who were undergoing the water cure, and obtained the following results : — 1. Patient suffering from chronic gout, sp. gravity of the sweat 1003"5. Water 995"5 Chloride of sodium - 3"0 Phosphate of ammonia - - '5 Acetate of ammonia - - "5 Hydrosulphate of ammonia - a trace Extractive matters - - "5 1000- 2.

Soluble in ether, but not in alcohol. The perspiration in different forms of disease possesses a peculiar odour, and many very fanciful opinions have been given on this point. Scabies is said to afford a mouldy odour; jaundice is musky, and syphilis 3. Patient suffering from otherwise healthy, sp. the sweat 1003. Water ... Chloride of sodium Phosphate of ammonia - Acetate of ammonia Hydrosulphate of ammonia Extractive matters sweet. In ague, the odour of fresh-baked brown bread is said to pass from the skin. Stark states that the quantity of lactic acid is increased in the sweat in scrofula, rhachitis, and some cutaneous eruptions. Prout noticed an increase in the quantity of salts in sweat in a case of dropsy. An excess of salts has also been noticed by An- selmino in a severe case of gout. It has been said that in cases of gouty and urinary con- cretions the quantity of phosphate of lime is increased. As regards the latter form of dis- ease, there is no good reason to believe the opinion above stated to be true. A great increase of lactic acid is observed in cases of rheumatism and gout; the sweat in such cases is always extremely acid. An- selmino, however, states, that he has ob- served the sweat after a gouty attack has passed off, containing a large proportion of ammonia. Anselmino and Stark state that they have detected albumen in sweat; the former in rheumatic fever, the latter in gas- tric, putrid, and hectic diseases, and in cases generally immediately before death. Simon could not detect it in sweat which he obtained from the breast of a person suffering from phthisis in the colliquative stage. Fat is also said to be found in large quan- tity in colliquative sweats. Bilin and biliary colouring matter, or biliphaein, have been found in the sweat of icteric persons. Berend says he has observed it in bilious fevers. Voigtel states, that he observed blood to sweat from under the arm of a young man after violent exertion. Such perspiration is also said to have been observed in scurvy and low typhus fever. Uric acid has been found in the sweat of gouty patients, probably in the form of urate of soda. Landerer observed a red-coloured sweat in a fever patient's axilla, which he believes to have contained the red colouring matter of the urine (uroerythrin). Blue perspira- tion has been noticed by several writers. Dr. Bleifuss noticed it coming from the foot of a patient suffering from abdominal disease. Michel noticed it in hysteria and hypochon- driasis. Sugar has been detected in the per- spiration of persons affected with diabetes, by Nasse. Various substances used internally as medicines, as articles of diet, or taken for the purpose of experiment, have been recog- nised in the sweat. These are, according to Stark, sulphur, mercury, iodine, iodide of po- tassium, assafetiila, garlic, saffron, olive oil, rhubarb, indigo, Prussian blue, and copper. Landerer observed, that if he took quina his sweat became bitter. In cases of Morbus Brightii I have been able more than once to detect urea in the perspiration, and I am inclined to believe it constantly present both in cases of suppres- sion and retention of urine. I have stated that experiments lately made by Landerer, the Athenian chemist, have proved urea to exist in the sweat in health. If this be proved, we of course can no longer regard it as an abnormal constituent of that8-15 SYMMETRY. fluid, but must look upon it merely as present in excess in the diseases above alluded to. (Cr. Owen lives.} SYMMETRY (aw—fiBrpov). In its general acceptation this word means a just and har- monious proportionment of parts to one another and to their whole ; in anatomy, how- ever, it has a different and more restricted meaning. With its anatomical signification alone 1 have now to deal, and that may be defined as follows:—Symmetry is a word used to express an idea that would be more correctly represented by a verb than a noun, for it is the idea of not a thing but a fact — the fact, namely, that one half of an animal is usually an exact reversed copy of the other— the right side is a reversed copy, or repetition, of the left. To this there are numerous ex- ceptions, even in the human subject; of which hereafter. That unreversed serial copying or repetition which is observable, for instance, between the scapular and pelvic limbs, is enunciated by the analogous expression serial homology. The point on which a distinction may be made between symmetry and homology, is that of the reversing of the copy or repetition as characteristic of the latter. This characteristic seems to impress one with the notion that the two halves are parts of a whole, whereas an unreversed serial recurrence of similar parts inclines one to accord a kind of separate in- dividuality to each repetition. A clear dis- tinction between these two styles of repetition ought undoubtedly to be firmly impressed and maintained on the mind. I have, however, for want of a convenient inflection of the word under consideration, at the risk of some confusion, been long accustomed to use the expression lateral homology in reference to symmetrical repetition — and in that sense I shall have to use it in this article. Whether the word symmetry should be applied to that antero-posterior repetition which is met with in caudal vertebrae of fishes, for instance, is not yet determined by usage, and it will be sufficient for me hereafter simply to make my remarks upon the apparent exist- ence of it. In so doing I shall use the ex- pression antero-posterior homology in a sense precisely parallel to that of lateral homology. Lateral Repetition.—That the right hand and foot, and the right side of the head and trunk, are the exact counterpart of the left is a fact so obvious, that merely to assert it seems an unnecessary truism. It should, however, by no means be regarded as a matter of course. It might have been otherwise. The human skeleton is, normally, perfectly symmetrical in all its details, and so are the skeletons of all vertebrate animals, with the exception of the Pleuronectidee, or flat fishes, noticed hereafter. The archetype or abstract ideal figure of an osseous vertebral segment, as that of Prof. Owen, at vol. iii. p. 824., is a symmetrical form. Rut it is doubtful whether any single bone in the skeleton should be re- garded as primordially mesial and symmetrical — whether any ossific point is originally in the middle line. The ideal archetype of the above illustrious author contains three mesial azygos elements, viz. the haemal and neural spines and centrum; but it has always ap- peared to me that each of these elements should be represented in the ideal by a pair of pieces, because each of them is occasionally represented in nature by a pair of bones : Prof. Owen, for instance, regards the two parietal bones as the neural spine of a ver- tebra. Though there is no difficulty in con- ceiving the coalescence of any number of pieces into one, and though it is easy to con- ceive that this coalescence may have occurred before the commencement of ossification, so that two or more of the points destined to be- come the centres of the ossifying process may be brought so close together as, when manifest by the earthy deposit, to appear but as one, yet it is not possible to conceive that two pieces can be developed from one ossific point. The single azygos condition may proceed from the double, but the double cannot proceed from the single ; therefore the double condition must be re- garded as the primordial, and should hold place in the abstract type. There are occasionally met with certain monstrosities which seem to show in a remarkable manner that a vertebra is composed of two lateral halves that are primordially separate. Thus, in double-headed monsters, wherein there are two vertebral columns above, which coalesce and form one below, the half of each of the two columns which is adjacent to the other seems to be lost at the point of coalescence, and the single column below this point seems to be com- posed of the right half of the one and the left half of the other of the two columns. In the skeleton of the Roa Constrictor preserved in the Hunterian Museum, there are two ver- tebrae that are double on the right side and single on the left, bearing two ribs on the right side and only one on the left ; or rather there are two specimens of right halves of vertebrae, existing independently, which are anchylosed, the one to the vertebra in advance of it, the other to the one behind it. This anchylosis alone justifies the expression "vertebrae double on the right side ;" but in neither instance is it so complete as by any means to mask the real nature of the independent half vertebra. Such facts as these, especially the existence of one half of a vertebra without the other, even seem, in contradiction to the impression stated above, to claim for each half of a vertebral segment the importance of a separate indi- viduality, such as is accorded to each ver- tebral segment itself. They seem to show that a vertebra is as much a compound of two lateral parts symmetrically repeating one an- other, as the human spinal column is a com- pound of thirty-three serial repetitions of ver- tebra?. The fact of the lateral halves being reversed copies of one another, I am disposed to regard as proof of their being parts only of a whole, and as disentitling them to an indi- viduality like that which we are accustomed to assign to unreversed serial repetitions; it846 SYMMETRY. may, however, be regarded as not sufficient proof of this. The value to be given to such facts depends, here as elsewhere, upon the peculiar bias of different minds, and the asso- ciations that pre-occupy them. It is not necessary in the present state of our know- ledge, nay, it is not expedient, to bind the mind down to this or that view of the facts that come before it. A remark, en passant, is due to the considera- tion that the corresponding organs and parts of organs of the two sides are not only similar in form and structure, but normally of exactly the same age. The corresponding ossific points of each side make their appearance at pre- cisely the same time, and in all respects the original development and subsequent evolu- tion and maturation of the embryo proceed exactly pari passu. The exceptions alone to this rule of symmetry will chiefly occupy our consideration. In Man, except perhaps in the very early stages of his existence, exceptions are offered by the heart, great blood-vessels, lymphatics of the trunk, lungs, bowels, liver, spleen, and pancreas, with their appendages. All these parts were in all probability, in the very earliest stages of the embryo, symmetrical ; most of them have been proved by actual observa- tion to have been so ; it is, however, difficult to conceive this to have been the case with the following other instances of departure from symmetry. All decussations in the middle line are a-syinmetrical. Indeed, if a fibre crosses the median line anyhow but at right angles, there is a departure from symmetry. Con- sequently, the decussation of the optic nerves, the decussation of fibres in the me- dulla oblongata, and the decussation of white fibres at the linea alba, are instances of ex- ceptions to symmetrical repetition. One is tempted, in the last instance especially, to believe that these decussations are not in the original embryonic pattern or plan ; but that they are developed subsequently, in obedience to subsequent circumstances : the knowledge of the power which circumstances, external or internal, existing at any period of an animal's life, have in modifying the directions of fibres of areolar tissue, and of affecting it in other ways, aids one in this belief. The most remarkable of the above instances, and that in which the primordial symmetry is most widely departed from, is the heart and the great blood-vessels that are immediately connected with it. The heart first makes its appearance as a mass of cells posited in the middle line, which soon becomes hollow and divided into three compartments, the lower one of which receives the embryonic veins, and is therefore the auricle, whilst the upper one is the commencement of the aorta, or bulbus arteriosus. The middle cavity (the ventricle) becomes bent into a horse-shoe form, so as to bring the auricle and bulbus into apposition. From the latter proceeds a median artery, giving off six arches on each side that surround the space occupied by the digestive canal and converge towards the spine, where they are received by two sym- metrical aortae. The vein that enters the auricle is a canal or sinus, that intercom- municates between two venous trunks sym- metrically placed on each side of the spine, called ductus Cuvieri, the posterior continua- tion of which is the cardinal (future azygos and hemi-azygos) veins ; and the anterior, the jugular. One of these ductus is permanent as the superior cava. The omphalo-mesenteric vein, which empties into the auricle, is at this time situated in the middle line between and in front of the cardinal veins, and into it falls the single mesial vena cava descen- dens. The precise periods at which these parts are first discernible, and those at which the changes about to be described take place, will be given in the article Ovum. It is the manner of their metamorphosis alone that bears upon this present inquiry. So far all is symmetrical ; now commence those changes whereby the adult impar arrange- ment is eventually effected. The fourth and fifth (from the heart) pairs of aortic arches (the two anterior pairs), and the right one of the second pair, soon disappear. The left one of the second pair is permanent as the arch of the aorta, and the third pair persist as the subclavian arteries. The first pair give off branches to the nascent lungs. Meantime, the lower (abdominal) parts of the aorta? have co- alesced, and those parts of them which inter- vene between the second arch on the left side (the arch of the aorta) and the third (the left subclavian), and between the first arch of the right side (right pulmonary artery) and the third (right subclavian), disappear. Now we have, on the left side, the first two arches uniting behind to form the left aorta. The first gives off' a branch to the lungs, and that portion of it which is beyond this pulmonic branch remains, as the ductus arteriosus, pervious till birth ; whilst that portion which is nearest to the heart remains, in connection with the pulmonic branch, permanent for life as the left pulmonary artery. On the right side the first arch alone, the second havingpreviously disappeared, forms the right aorta, which soon joins its fellow with which it coalesces below. The proxi- mal part of this arch is permanent, and re- mains in connection with its pulmonic branch as the right pulmonary artery, whilst the part of it beyond the pulmonic branch, together with its continuation, the right aorta, down to its point of junction with its fellow, soon disappears. A septum, meanwhile, has been developed in the ventricle of the heart, divid- ing it into right and left ventricles, and an imperfect one in the auricle. The bulbus arteriosus also has been divided by a sep- tum, in such a manner that the first pair of arches remains in connection with one division of it, which communicates with one of the ventricles, whilst the permanent left arch of the second pair communicates with the other division, and through it with the other ven- tricle. It is most probable that these septa, when first developed, extend from side to847 SYMMETRY. side, consequently that the systemic ventricle and aorta are at first in front of the pulmo- nary ventricle and artery, and that the heart subsequently undergoes a twist towards the right, carrying the systemic ventricle round behind to its permanent position on the left. In reptiles, in which a great many other of the mammalian foetal characters are permanent, the root of the systemic is in front of that of the pulmonic artery, and there is not that twining round one another of the great arterial trunks which is met with in man. Thus, then, these, the most unsymmetrical parts of the whole body, can be proved by actual observation to have been originally perfectly symmetrical, and the manner of their attainment to their ultimate unsymmetrical form can be accu- rately traced. The a-symmetry of the lungs is little more than a trifling difference of size between the two, dependent upon the encroachment of the heart by its displacement towards the left. And the a-symmetry of the great abdominal viscera enumerated above, and of their appen- dages, depends entirely upon lateral displace- ment and excesses of growth of one side over the other, having reference to conve- nience of packing. This a-symmetry, greater in mammalia than in reptiles and fishes, on account of the presence of the diaphragm, which, so to speak, thrusts the abdominal viscera downwards, necessitating lateral dis- placement, attains its acme in man, owing to the great lateral measurement compared with the antero-posterior distance which is so conspicuous in his figure when contrasted with that of other animals. The hepatic at- tachments of the falciform ligament and gastro-splenic omentum landmark the original median line of the liver ; and that larger part of it which is to the right of the ligament and behind the omentum, is the right lateral homologue of that lesser part which is to the left of the ligament and in front of the omen- tum. The gall-bladder appears to be an un- symmetrical organ, situated to the right of the median line. I am unable to state whether or not a left gall-bladder has once existed and been suppressed, or whether it is a diverticu- lar production of the gall-duct evolved subse- quently to the first sketching of the embryo ; or, lastly, whether it is originally median and subsequently displaced. The anterior wall of the stomach is the left lateral homologue of the posterior wall. The spleen is an ori- ginally median organ, situated in the originally median meso-gastrium. The great omentum is a pouching out of the meso-gastrium to- wards the left, consequently its outer surface is the left lateral homologue of its inner sur- face.* The pancreas is an originally median organ, one end of which has been displaced along with the pylorus towards the right, so that its anterior aspect is the left lateral ho- mologue of the posterior. The intestinal canal can be witnessed in the embryo as a straight, uniform, mesial, and symmetrical * See Peritoneum. tube, until its length having become greater than that of the region which it is destined to occupy, it is compelled to arrange itself in gyrations and loops. The posterior and an- terior walls of the stomach were originally, as indicated above, its right and left halves; and as to the other parts of the alimentary tube, whatever difficulty there is in recog- nising the manner of their displacement in the human subject, is at once dispelled by examining their condition in the lower animals. No difficulty whatever is encoun- tered in respect of the small intestines, for their mesentery is attached nearly in the median line ; the bowels themselves, however, are continually varying their position, relative and positive, according to the manner of packing most convenient for their variable contents. Not so easy is it to understand the kind of displacement which has taken place in respect of the large intestines. The colon is curled back, and crosses over the small intes- tine from right to left, forming a loop. In the human subject, the true relation of these parts is further masked by the singular circum- stance of this crossing over occurring just at the point where the meso-gastrium, after having descended as the great omental bag, is returning to the spine, and the colon, finding it there, so to speak, avails itself of it, and uses it as a mesentery ; anatomists have named this borrowed portion of the meso- gastrium the transverse meso-colon. In Ru- minants the colon, being exceedingly long, avails itself also of the mesentery of the small intestines, into which a loop of it is thrust further and further until it makes three turns ; so that in tracing the colon onwards with the finger, you make three spiral turns in the mesentery, and then double and return by three spiral turns placed between the former spirals.* On the other hand, in the Carnivora, where the colon is very short, it crosses over the lower end of the ileum so near to its termination that it is evident that the next degree of shortening must result in the continuation of the small and large intestines in a straight line, This actually takes place in the Reptilia f, and then there is no longer any difficulty in recognising the original mesial and symmetrical position of the intestinal tube and its appendages, so displaced in the human subject as to make this recognition so extremely difficult. It is by no means uncommon to meet with instances where all the unsymmetri- cal iy posited organs of the human body are placed completely vice versa to their usual situations; the heart pointing towards the right ; its pulmonic to the left of its systemic ventricle; the vena cava to the left of the aorta ; the liver in the left, and the spleen in the right hypochondrium; and the caecum in the left iliac fossa. Almost every anatomical museum contains an instance of this kind ; and in all instances where the history of the case before death was known, the average health * See Ruminantia. f See Jig. 491. Vol. III. Peritoneum.848 SYMMETRY. and ordinarily well-developed state of the subject attested the insignificance of this trans- position in respect to the well-being of the individual. Such cases are most interesting from this consideration,—that all the unsym- metrical organs are transposed. There is, I believe, no instance on record of one, or two, or less than the whole of the unsymmetrical organs occupying the side which is not their usual one. This prompts the belief that the side which these organs shall respectively oc- cupy is determined by a single impulse first given to one of them. Abnormal deviations from symmetry are of extremely frequent occurrence. The blood- vessels of the body are very rarely perfectly symmetrical. In the adult subject the two sides of the body rarely match exactly in ex- ternal form. The right hand is usually larger than the left. Accidental circumstances oc- curring to an individual frequently disturb the symmetry, but it is by no means uncommon to meet with evidence of hereditary trans- mission of aberrations from symmetry. Such monstrosities as supernumerary fingers and toes are sometimes symmetrical, but just as frequently, perhaps more frequently, the mon- strosity exists on one side alone. Comparative Anatomy.—I pass on now hastily to notice such deviations from sym- metry as are met with in the normal conditions of the lower animals belonging to the ver- tebrate sub-kingdom, and to examine the question of symmetry in the other sub-king- doms. In all Mammalia there is much the same departure from symmetry in the viscera of the chest and abdomen as is found in the human subject ; but in no other mammal is the lateral displacement so great as in man, for in all others there is a greater proportionate antero- posterior depth of chest and belly. The only other notable instances of a-symmetry known to exist in the mammalian class are the fol- lowing: — In the male narwhal or sea-unicorn the left front incisor tooth attains the enormous length of eight or ten feet, while the right one is found as a rudiment that, never pierces the gum. Spirals in the middle line are departures from symmetry ; consequently the spiral penis of the boar, &c. must be regarded as instances of a-symmetry ; a slight excess in length of one of the halves is sufficient to produce this spiral form. The left nostril of most of the Ce- taceais constantly much larger than the right. In Birds there is much the same want of symmetry in the viscera of the trunk as is met with in mammals. The right one of the se- cond pair of embryonic aortic arches however is retained instead of the left, so that the adult aorta arches over the right bronchus. But notwithstanding this, the left ventricle is the systemic one, and presents the same excess over the right, in the thickness of its walls, as in Mammalia. Both of the ductus Cuvieri are retained and form two superior vence cava;. The liver is situated mesially, that is to say, its great fissure and falciform ligament are in the middle line ; but its left lobe is usually the larger, and in the common fowl presents a fissure which is not repeated in the right. The cesopliagus diverges slightly towards the right, but the cardiac orifice of the stomach is to the left of the pyloric. The long loop described by the duodenum, and the pancreas which is surrounded by it, are found extending diagon- ally across the abdomen in front of the other bowels, their extremity resting in the left iliac fossa, but they are not fixed in this position. The gall bladder is situated as in Mammalia. There being no great omentum, the spleen occupies its typical position behind the sto- mach. There is usually a disparity in the length of the pair of casca met with in this class. But the most remarkable exception to sym- metry in the class Aves is that which exists in the female generative organs. The left ovary and oviduct alone are functionally evolved, whilst the right, becoming atrophied at an early period, are barely traceable in the adult ani- mal. A few instances are on record where these right lateral homologues of the ovary and oviduct have been found evolved in func- tional size as a testicle and vas deferens, thus forming lateral hermaphrodism. The male generative organs of birds are all symmetrical except the penis, when it exists, which is spiral. Another instance of want of symmetry is presented by the beak of some birds, as the cross-bill, &c. Reptiles. — The heart of reptiles is situ- ated in the middle line, but it is not symme- trical in form, nor do the great blood-vessels enter and quit it in a perfectly symmetrical manner ; they however approach more nearly to symmetry in this class than in any of those which have been previously considered. In all reptiles there are at first two aortae, sym- metrically disposed, arching over the right and left bronchi respectively, and uniting with one another to form one trunk on the spine. The vessels given ofF from these are, however, most generally not symmetrical, the head and front limbs being supplied frequently from the right arch alone, and the chylopoietic viscera from the left alone. The pulmonary arteries arise behind the origin of the aortae. The lungs of reptiles are usually two symmetrical organs, but in the Ophidia the left lung, when it exists, is much shorter than the right, and in some, as Coluber thiringicus, it is wanting altogether, the only vestige of it being a cascal depression on the left side of the lower end of the trachea ; this absence of the left lung entails, of course, the loss of the left pulmonary vessels. The stomach and bowels of the Chelonia, owing to the flattened form of the animals, are nearly as much laterally displaced as in the human subject. In the other reptiles they are not much out of symmetry, yet in none are they exactly symmetrical. The car- diac end of the stomach tends, though often but a little, towards the left ; the pyloric is free, and can be brought without violence to the middle line, but yet it is always found849 SYMMETRY. leaning to the right. This renders the spleen more conspicuous on the left. The liver of reptiles extends from side to side, but the right lobe is the largest.* In the tadpoles of toads and frogs, I have observed that there is no gill opening on the right side. In the Lepido-siren the anus is situated on the right side of the mesial ridge of the tail. Fishes. — The heart of fishes is posited symmetrically, but the relative position of the auricle and ventricle is usually unsymmetrical, the former being behind and to the left side of the latter. The single arterial trunk, with its branchial arches and the coalescing aorta;, however, are ,precisely alike on both sides. The intestinal canal, being generally much longer than the abdomen of the fish, is neces- sitated to throw itself into unsymmetrical loops and convolutions. There is a very remarkable departure from symmetry in all the members of the group of fishes called Vleuronectidce, or flat fishes, such as the turbot, halibut, sole, and flounder. These fishes lie at the bottom, and swim, on one side; and the side which they keep uppermost is coloured dark like the back of other fishes, whilst that which they keep undermost is white like another fish's belly. The dark-coloured side is also somewhat convex, whilst the white side is nearly flat. The dorsal azygos fin is continued on to the head, beyond the eyes, almost to the muzzle, and, what is most remarkable of all, both the eyes appear on the dark side, and are actually both situated on one side of the dorsal azygos fin. With the exception of the different co- lour of the skin, the different degrees of con- vexity of the two sides, and a slight distortion of the mouth, the whole of these fishes are symmetrical in all their parts, besides the eyes and the structures immediately surrounding them. The bones immediately contiguous to the eyes suffer the following remarkable dis- tortion :—The occipital bone is almost per- fectly symmetrical, and its mesial crest is continued far forward as a sagittal crest be- tween the parietals in the real as well as the apparent middle line, supporting the styliform bones to which the rays of the dorsal azygos fin are articulated. There is a slight dif- ference in the size of the parietals, that of the right or white side being the largest ; but it is the frontal and pre-frontal bones that suffer the greatest distortion. Arriving at the frontals, the real or primordial middle line is suddenly deflected towards the left or dark side, whilst the sagittal crest, still supporting the azygos fin, is continued straight on, on the right fron- tal alone. The left frontal is less expanded, but more clumsy than the right, and extends forwards in a curved form between the eyes, presenting a concavity towards the right. To tliis concave curve is sutured a falciform pro- cess produced from the left anterior corner of the right frontal, which is quadrate. This suture of course indicates the real middle line. The eyes are situated on each side of the sep- * Vol. IV. fig. 220. p. 304 art. Beptilia. VOL. IV. turn thus formed. The end of this compound septum rests on the suture between the two pre-frontals, and this suture, which again in- dicates the real mesial line, presently regains the apparent middle. The right pre-frontal is much larger than the left, and comes again into contact with the right frontal on the outside of the right eye, which therefore oc- cupies an orbit with a complete bony margin, whilst, the same thing not occurring on the left, the eye of that side has no orbit, but seems to lie loose in the soft structures of the cheek. The symmetry of the base of the skull is disturbed but slightly, the long sphenoid and vomer forming nearly a straight line, and participating but slightly in the abrupt deflection of the middle line which takes place above. Not the least curi- ous part of this history is the non-participa- tion of the dorsal azygos fin in the deflection of the mesial line : it furnishes an additional proof that its rays are not a part of the endo- skeleton. The eyes of the pleuronects are of different sizes ; the furthest from the dorsal fin (the left, the one that has no orbit) being the smallest, and the optic nerve and optic lobes of the brain, which belong to it, are smaller than their fellows.* In using the terms right and left in the above descriptions, I have constantly had in view the turbot, which is coloured, and shows its eyes on the left side; but the sole, dab, and flounder, are coloured on the right, and therefore those terms must be reversed when applied to them. It is extremely common to meet with individual specimens of Pleuro- nectidae coloured, so to speak, on the wrong side, that is to say, not on that side which is usual, and the rule for the species. Turbots coloured, and having their eyes on their right sides, are frequently met with, and the flound- ers brought to the London market are almost as frequently coloured, and show their eyes, on the left as on the right side. The un- symmetrically posited intestines of these fishes do not participate in this transposition, but occupy, respectively, the same sides in the monstrous as in the normal individuals. The frequency of these monstrosities tempts one to conjecture that external circumstances may, perhaps, determine which side of the pleuronect shall have the eyes and be coloured. Articulata.—The animals composing this sub-kingdom are bilateral and symmetrical. The abstract pattern or type of an articulate animal, like that of the Vertebrata, is a sym- metrical figure.t From this primordial sym- metry there are but few deviations, and those exceedingly trifling in amount. Amongst the Entozoa, the English tape- worm {Taenia solium), if the flat sides be taken as dorsal and ventral, presents an in- stance of a-symmetry in the position of its genital orifices, which are situated on the edge of each joint, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, indifferently. In the Natural History series of the Mu- * See fig. 409. Vol. III. t Vol. 1. Fig. 378. art. Crustacea. 3 i850 SYMMETRY. seum of the College of Surgeons (No. 205.), there is a portion of a taenia lata, which ex- hibits a monstrosity very interesting in its bearing on the question of the individuality of half segments (p. 845.). On one side, which for distinction we will call right, there are three half segments, the middle one of which unites with two half segments of the left side, leaving the upper and lower of the three right halves isolated and independent. One of these contains a generative apparatus. Mollusca.-—In this sub-kingdom absence of symmetry seems to be the rule — its pre- sence the exception. There are great prac- tical difficulties in the way of finding an ab- stract notion or type of a mollusk such as have been found for the Vertebrata and Arti- culata. If, however, such type be symme- trical, that symmetry is departed from much oftener than it is preserved. There is no appearance in any mollusk of a serial re- petition of parts — nothing like serial ho- mology, except in the Chitons, whose shell consists of a number of similar symmetrical transverse bands. The highest class of mol- lusks, the Cephalopoda, are symmetrical, and when they inhabit shells, as the Argonaut and pearly Nautilus, their shells are symme- trical. But the enormous number of species comprised in the classes Gasteropoda and Acephala are nearly all unsymmetrical. The slugs are the most symmetrical of the Gaste- ropoda in their external form, but here the air-orifice, for instance, is on one side. Radiata. — For convenience of illustration, I select from among the animals composing this sub-kingdom the common star-fish. (Figs. 16, 22, &c. Vol. I. Art. Eciiinodermata.) This animal presents to our view a flattened form with five exactly similar rays or arms ra- diating from the centre, where is posited the mouth. Around the mouth is a nervous circle consisting of a number of ganglia corresponding to the arms, connected with each other by intercommunicating cords. Each arm is symmetrical in itself. Now this figure may be divided into two symmetrical halves by a line drawn across it in either of five different diameters. What is to decide which of these is to be regarded as the mesial line ? For- tunately there is, on the side which is the reverse to that on which the oral orifice is placed, a peculiar spot, the remains of an embryonic structure, which is not in the centre, and will therefore serve for a datum. In certain other echinoderms the anus is situ- ated eccentrically, in which case it also may be taken as a datum. But still a line drawn through either of these, the number of the arms not being an even number, will divide one of them in its middle on one side, and pass through the interspace between two of them on the other. This, as the arms are exact repetitions of one another, seems an unnatural and arbitrary proceeding. Still, though it possesses no natural middle line, and consequently is not bilateral, yet is the star-fish a symmetrical animal, for the idea of bilateralism is by no means included in our definition of symmetry. Whenever a number of exactly similar parts symmetrical in themselves are arranged around a centre, whether their number be two, as in bilateral forms, or five, as in the star-fish, the whole figure is symmetrical. Abandoning then the idea of bilateralism, we may look upon the star-fish as composed of five repe- titions arranged around a centre. Regarding it in this manner, we are able to institute a comparison between the form of the star-fish and that of the segmented vertebrates and articulates. The star-fish may be regarded as analogous to one segment of a vertebrate or articulate — an animal with one vertebra. I use the term " analogous," and not " homologous," because the relation called special homology cannot be demonstrated, in any instance, between animals belonging to different sub-kingdoms. The head, the legs, the brain of an articulate, are only function- ally the head, legs, or brain. They perform the same function as, but they cannot be shown to be homologous with, the head, legs, or brain of a vertebrate. Indeed I have long held that the sub-kingdoms should be limited by refer- ence to special homology : all animals among which homologies can be pointed out—which all conform to the same type — should be grouped together to form a sub-kingdom. The view of the analogy of a radiate animal to a vertebrate or articulate animal just given, is considerably strengthened by the manner of development of the common medusa. The larva of the medusa is a polypiform living thing, anchored by one end and tentaculated at the other. This, after a while, becomes marked with numerous constrictions, like a segmented animal, which constrictions become more and more deep until they completely divide the quondam polypiform being into a number of pieces, each of which becomes a perfect medusa. Here is a segmented animal, each of whose joints becomes an independent radiate individual; ergo, each individual is analogous to one segment of a vertebrate or articulate. Towards a different view tends the fact, that though five, or a multiple of five, is usually the number of the rays of the star-fish, yet there are some members of the same group the number of whose arms are neither the one nor the other; for instance, there are eleven and twelve-armed asterias. Now there is such perfect constancy in the number of the parts of vertebrate and articulate segments, that that constancy seems an integral element of the idea of an archetype. There is, however, no constancy in the number of the vertebrate or articulate segments that go to constitute an animal, and therefore some may regard each arm of an asteria as analogous to a vertebra ;—■ the common star-fish, as composed of five analogues of vertebral archetypes arranged in a circle, — as a segmented animal bent upon itself, with its anteriorand posteriorextremities adherent to one another. Which of these two views is the correct one — whether either is correct — can be decided then only when the true import of serial homology and of sym-SYMMETRY 851 3 i 2 metry is definitely ascertained ; when it is de- termined what is due to division, what to radiation, or whether division and radiation, one, or both, or neither, are concerned in their causation. The skeleton of the VclcUa presents an in- stance of departure.from symmetry, mainly in the oblique set of its vertical plate. The common medusa has a circular outline, and exhibits four quarters, which repeat one another exactly, so that it seems to be marked with a right-angled cross. The horizontal plate of the skeleton of Velella is distorted to a sub-rhomboid form, and marked with two diagonal seams that cross one another obliquely. The longer one of these diagonals is produced upwards so as to form the oblique sail-supporting vertical plate, which also pre- sents a seam continued up from the point of crossing of the diagonals, indicating that it is composed of two parts uniting at this central point. This de facto unsymmetrical radiate is therefore easily reduced in idea to its pri- mordial symmetry. Infusoria. — Out of the vast number of various forms met with amongst these animal- cules the greater number are symmetrical. This symmetry is usually not bilateral, but that of the star-fish. There are, however, some forms which are quite irreconcilable with sym- metry, which no line can divide into two similar halves, which are one, and present no repetitions of parts ; except, indeed, when they are undergoing fissiparous generation. Anteroposterior (Symmetry. — By re- ference to the diagram at page 824. Vol. III. Fig. 433,, representing the abstract notion or type of a vertebral segment, it will be seen that the upper or posterior half is a reverse of the lower or anterior. Referring to what really exists in nature, we find, in the caudal vertebrae of fish, that their dorsal and ven- tral halves are counterparts tolerably exact, yet that exactness is not nearly what exists between the lateral halves. If an antero- posterior as well as a lateral symmetry be admitted, then we have four repetitions ar- ranged around a centre. At all events there is here, in the Vertebrata, some amount of evidence of radiation or divergence from a central axis comparable in some degree to what we see in the Radiata. The anterior and posterior parts of vertebral segments, as | found in nature, are usually extremely dissimilar. The rays of the dorsal and ab- dominal (anal) azygos fins of fishes are an- tero-posterior repetitions, but the fan-like tail fin, which in most fishes seems to be remarkably symmetrical antero-posteriorly, half of it apparently belonging to the dorsal and the other half to the abdominal moiety of the fish, usually belongs, as I have ob- served in the typical fishes, cyprinoid, &c, in reality, entirely to the abdominal or under moiety. The embryo of these fishes at first has a tail like an eel, into which the spinal column is continued nearly to its tip. A little way from the extremity of this, on the abdominal aspect, a group of fin rays are soon observed to sprout out meanwhile that the end of the vertebral co- lumn shrinks and turns up. The group of fin rays grows, and the vertebral column shrinks, so that in time the former is brought to form the fan-like extremity of the animal ; but even then the atrophied end of the verte- bral column may be detected occupying the upper edge of the fan. Even in the adult fish some trace of this original relation of the tail fin can be detected. If the tail of an adult homocercal fish be macerated or boiled, and all the pieces which are not an- chylosed to it be removed, what remains will not be symmetrical, but will terminate by turning or cocking up. Even in the Pleuro- nectidae, whose tails seem to be remarkably symmetrical, and where the spinal column seems to terminate in a flat triangular piece, it will be found that the lower half of this piece can be easily removed, whilst the upper half forms one piece with the body of the last vertebra, with which, in fact, it forms a coccyx composed of numerous degenerated and consolidated vertebrae. Symmetry' of Disease.—This subject has been most ably treated by Dr. W. Budd * of Bristol. Those local diseases, the cause of which is in the blood, usually affect the solids of the body symmetrically. This can be often well observed in lepra, psoriasis, se- condary syphilis, gout, and rheumatism, and in the eruption caused by taking the iodide of potassium. It is due, no doubt, to the symmetrical disposition of those tissues for which the morbid poisons have a peculiar affi- nity. It proves,.moreover, that there is more of peculiarity in certain parts of organs than what meets the eye, which peculiarity is sym- metrical. For, though the tissue of all parts of a bone, for instance, shall be exactly the same, it shall be diseased at a certain part only, and the disease shall be repeated in ex- actly the same part of the corresponding bone of the opposite side. Connected with this is the observation made above, that the corre- sponding points of both sides of the body are exactly of. the same age — have reached a cer- tain stage of development at exactly the same time. But the force of this observation in explaining the symmetry of disease is consi- derably weakened by another fact noticed by Dr. W. Budd, namely, that the diseases above named are apt also to localise themselves in parts that are serially homologous, or corre- sponding in the upper or lower limbs, as the knee and elbow, wrist and ankle; for these parts, though homologous, are not of the same age. It is well known that the development of the upper and lower limbs does not pro - ceed pari -passu. There is here, at least, some determining agency more mysterious than mere age. Still more curious and mysterious is the relation of the eruption called shingles to the bilateralism of the body. It often ex- tends zone-like around one half, stopping exactly at the median line before and behind, * Medico-Chirurgical Transactions for 1842.852 SYMPATHY. and thus seemingly affording evidence of that individuality of one half of the body which was spoken of as a feasible opinion above. Plants. — The leaf of the higher plants, which is the unit or individual of botanists, is bilateral and symmetrical — always in idea, generally in fact. These leaves are associated together to form buds, branches, flowers, or fruits, in whorls. Symmetrical figures are often produced by these associations, but yet the pattern is spiral. In watching the develop- ment of spores of conferva, they are seen, whilst still but single cells, to shoot out in various manners, the majority of which are quite irre- concilable with symmetry, either bilateral or ra- diating. Whatever may be its import," it is quite certain, from the very nature of symmetry, that the cause of it must be internal, that is to say, within the body in which it is mani- fested. But it has been conclusively deter- mined, byexperiments.that external influences, acting upon them in certain directions only, such as light, heat, and gravitation, exert a considerable power in determining the form of vegetable productions. Animals, doubt- less, are also greatly affected by these agencies, yet, as they enjoy the faculty of locomotion whereby all parts of them are successively turned towards the directions from which these forces emanate, the form impressed upon them by internal causes, suffers little or no distortion therefrom; but plants, being destitute of locomotion, continually receive these influences in a partial manner, and con- sequently we the less expect to meet with symmetry among them. Whenever their in- ternal forces tend to make them symmetrical, the partial action of external agents is apt to disturb their symmetry. It is this, probably, that renders the germinating conferva cell unsymmetrical. Cr ystals of unorganised matter are spoken of as symmetrical. The symmetry, however, which they exhibit .is not a bilateral sym- metry. It consists of the repetition of the same angles and facets at the poles of an axis, but the repetitions are not reverses. The reader may illustrate my meaning by cut- ting a rhomboid in paper, when he will observe that each of its angles and sides are twice re- peated, but he will find it impossible to fold it so that one half shall coincide with the other. The precise import of the symmetry of or- ganised bodies is, as repeatedly indicated above, as yet involved in mystery. Albeit a fact so evident, so constantly obvious to our senses, as often, like gravitation, to pass unheeded, it is a great and an important fact, — a fact of the same order with those which have already led to the establishment and demonstration of grand, comprehensive, and unassailable theo- ries—the blight triumphs of the human intel- lect, that have reduced to order, simplicity, and connexion, what before was all confused, complicated, and disjointed, — a fact, there- fore, that inspires us with hope for our, as yet, imperfect science of anatomy. It seems to tell of radiant forces, of certain, definite, mathematical, and inexorable laws, concerned in the production of animals. Taken with the other important fact — serial homology, it seems to suggest for the development of Vertebrata and Articulata the multiplica- tion of centres in a serial line — of centres of radiant force, that then proceed to in- duce the surrounding particles to arrange themselves in a symmetrical figure. In truth, as the mind contemplates this fact, various theories pass before it, yet shadowy, change- able, and indistinct as a phantasmagoria. One day, perhaps, some one of these shall meet with definite enunciation and clear demon- stration ; at present we must be content with putting the fact of symmetry prominently forward and exhibiting it in various points of view, with declaring it an important fact, and not a matter of course. (S. R. Pittard.) SYMPATHETIC NERVE.—(See Sup- plement.) SYMPATHY (W-7ra0os).—Sympathy may be defined as the assumption by different individuals, or by different parts of the same individual, of the same or an analogous physio- logical or pathological state at the same time, or in rapid succession. It is popularly known that the act of yawning, performed by one individual in a company, is apt to induce in many of the others an irresistible tendency to the same act. In a similar manner, the excite- ment of certain emotions (mirth or sadness, laughter or tears) is apt to spread through an assemblage of persons with extraordinary rapidity. The power of eloquence, of music, or of spectacle,toproduce such effects,is witnessed every day in places of public resort, whether for devotion, business, or amusement. Many instances are known in which con- vulsions have been excited in persons not previously subject to them, by the sight of a patient in an epileptic fit. And peculiar ner- vous disorders, of a convulsive kind, have been found to affect nearly all the members of a community without the slightest evidence of their being contagious or infectious. An impression upon an organ of sense may pro- duce effects very different in their nature to any thing which could be anticipated ; and these many be purely of a physical kind, or they may act primarily upon the mind. Thus certain odours will induce syncope in some people; and the smell of a savoury dish to a hungry person, or even the mention or the thought of a meal, will excite a flow of saliva. The emotion of pity excited by the sight of some object of compassion, or by a narrative of a mournful kind, will produce a copious flow of tears. All such phenomena are said to result from Sympathy. When one yawns, immediately in consequence of another's yawning, the former evidently and truly sympathises with the latter ; and the convulsions which are induced by the sight of another in a fit, are not less sympathetic. The individual in whom the convulsions are induced, sympathises with the other. Such obvious instances of sym- pathy between different individuals led to theSYMPATHY. 853 3 I 3 supposition of some such similar consent between different or even distant parts in the same person. Motions or sensations caused in certain parts, in consequence of a primary irritation of other and distant parts, are of the sym- pathetic kind. These motions or sensations are produced in, as it were, an indirect or circuitous manner, or one different from that in which they are ordinarily excited. Thus a stimulus to the olfactory membrane causes a peculiar affection of the sense of smell, and occasions that depression of the heart's action, from which results a state of syncope. Or another affection of the same sense causes a suddenly increased action of the salivary glands. If we analyse any one of these examples of sympathetic actions, it will appear that three circumstances may be noticed in the produc- tion of the phenomena: 1st, the primary exciting cause, which may be an object pre- sented to the mind through one of the organs of sense, or causing an impression upon any sensitive nerve, and therefore upon some part of the centre of sensation;. 2ndly, the part affected directly by this primary stimulus ; and, 3rdly, the action or sensation resulting from the affection of this part. Many other sensations or motions may he enumerated besides those above referred to, whether occurring in health or in disease; and we shall give examples of these before we discuss this subject further. The examples of sympathetic sensations which may be adduced are chiefly of the mor- bid kind. Pain is felt at a certain part, in consequence of an irritation in another part distant from it, and apparently altogether unconnected with it. A familiar instance of this is pain in the knee from disease of the hip-joint. So marked in some instances is the pain in the knee, and so much has it ab- sorbed the patient's attention, that the real seat of the disease has been overlooked, and the remedies been applied exclusively to the knee. Pain in the right shoulder, from disease of the liver, is a sympathetic sensa- tion of similar kind; and sometimes the hepatic irritation causes pain over a more extensive surface. Whytt mentions, that, in two cases of suppuration of the liver, he had seen the patients " affected with a numbness and debility of the right arm, thigh, and leg." Sometimes both shoulders are the seat of pain, from hepatic irritation. The peculiar sensations felt in the teeth from a noise which grates upon the ears, is sympathetic of the irritation of the auditory nerve. Practitioners are well aware how many morbid sensations in parts remote from the intestinal canal may be cured by the removal of scybala cm- other accumulations from it. Painful affections of the nerves of the face, and of other parts, are often due to a cause of this kind. The irritation of a stone in the bladder gives rise to pains in the thighs, or to itching at the end of the penis ; and uterine irritation, whether from disease or from the enlargement of that organ in con- nection with the early stage of pregnancy, causes similar pains in the nerves of the thighs. Headache and defective vision are fre- quently produced by disordered stomach. A draught of very cold water, or ice, taken quickly into the stomach, may occasion acute pain in the course of either frontal nerve. This same nerve on one side is frequently the seat of pain after the imprudent use of acid wines or other fermented liquors. Movements, excited by the operation of a stimulus applied at a distance, form a large proportion of the instances of sympathetic phenomena. All the ordinary physical ner- vous actions in which motions are excited by stimulating a sentient surface, may be regarded as examples of sympathetic actions.* The contraction of the iris upon the application of the stimulus of light to the retina, or of the pharyngeal muscles by stimulating the mucous membrane of the fauces, are instances in point where the stimulus acts indirectly upon the contracting fibre. Nothing is more sure than that in these instances the change wrought by the stimulus in certain sentient nerves, travels by a circuitous route through a nervous centra to the muscles which are called into action. Akin to these actions are the forcible respira- tory movements which may be excited by ir- ritation of the tracheal membrane, as coughing ; or sneezing, by stimulating the nasal mem- brane ; or vomiting, by irritating the fauces. Spasmodic affections are often instances of morbid actions in sympathy with intestinal irritation, or the irritation of teething in chil- dren. Partial or general convulsions are very frequently due to either or both these causes. We have known the most violent opisthotonos co-existing for a considerable time w ith the pre- sence of lumbricoid ascarides in the intestine; but ceasing immediately on the removal of the worms. Vomiting is commonly sympathetic of diseased kidney, or of the passage of a calculus along the ureter; or of the passage of a gall-stone along the gall duct; or it may be induced by the introduction of a catheter into the urethra. The consentaneous action of symmetrical parts is no doubt due to a similar cause to that by which most of the sympathetic actions are excited, and more especially in those parts where symmetry of action is constant, al- though liable to be interrupted by the influence of the will. A distinct class of sympathetic actions con- sists of those in which certain parts enlarge or become developed simultaneously with, and to a certain extent in effect of, the increase * It has been remarked, that the term " sympa- thetic actions" involves a contradiction. But it may be observed, that the contraction of the mus- cles, on which the action depends, is only the natural mode in which that class of vital organs can manifest their consent with certain states of nervous centres, or of sensitive nerves. The action is the result of the state which the muscle assumes in sympathy with the stimulated nerve. The con- tradiction is therefore apparent, not real.854. SYMPATHY. of others. The penis, the beard, the vocal organs, experience a marked increase of de- velopment at the adult period of life simul- taneously with the enlargement of the testes; and, it may be added, in effect of their increase, because the early removal of these organs pre- vents the growth of the others. And so like- wise as the ovaria are developed, the uterus, the vulva, the mammae, increase in size; the ovarian and uterine irritation which accom- panies the menstrual flux causes enlargement of the breasts, which subsides as soon as that period has gone by. The various examples enumerated in the preceding paragraphs may be classed under three heads: first, sympathies between dif- ferent individuals ; secondly, those which affect the mind, and, through it, the body; and, thirdly, those which are strictly organic, and therefore physical. Of the first class of sympathies we can offer no physical explanation. Whether the ner- vous system of one individual can directly affect that of another, or whether the effect is produced on the imagination, and after- wards on the nervous system, are questions still sub Judice. The serpent fascinates his prey, apparently by the power of his eyes, and it is well known that one man can exert a marked control over another by a mere look; and in the same way man can control other animals, even the fiercest carnivora, by a firm and decided glance of the eyes. It is no explanation of sympathetic phenomena of this kind to ascribe them to the effect of a tendency to imitation. Imitation is voluntary; these actions are involuntary, or take place even in despite of the will.* In the second class of sympathetic pheno- mena, an affection of the mind is a necessary link. But why that affection of the mind should produce its peculiar effect is a question difficult to solve. Why should the perception of certain odours produce in one case in- creased action of the salivary glands, and in the other case cause syncope ? The only reply which can be made to this question is, that in these instances the impression on the senso- rium causes a change there analogous to that which an original affection of the mind of similar kind would produce, and therefore gives rise to effects of the same nature as those resulting from that mental change. Thus the smell of savoury food excites in the mind the idea of food, which in a hungry man would, if it occurred spontaneously, occasion a flow of saliva. And the odour which oc- casions syncope, creates in the mind an emo- tion of disgust, which, if it arose independently of the physical impression, would affect the heart through the centre of emotion. It is plain, however, that that portion of the ner- vous centre which is affected in such cases, must have a direct influence upon the parts in which the sympathetic phenomena appear; and this through commissural fibres, or the continuity of its gray matter with that of the centre from which its nerves immediately spring; thus, in the instances referred to, the * Bostock's Physiology, vol. iii. p. 227. centre of sensation, which is first affected, is, through the medulla oblongata, connected with the salivary glands by the fifth nerve, and with the heart by the vagus. We derive an explanation of the third class of sympathetic phenomena from the known laws of sensitive and motor nerves. It is known that stimulation of a sensitive nerve at its origin, or in any part of its course, will give rise to a sensation which will be re- ferred to the peripheral extremity of the sti- mulated fibres ; and that a stimulus applied to a motor nerve causes a change in it which spreads peripherad from the point stimulated, and therefore affects the muscular parts with which it is connected. It is known also, that a sentient nerve may excite a motor or sensi- tive nerve which is implanted near to it in the nervous centre — doubtless through the change which it produces in that centre ; nor can it be doubted that a sensitive nerve may receive such a powerful stimulus as to exalt the polar force of a large portion of the nervous centre in the neighbourhood of its insertion, and thus to excite a similar change in all the nerves, whether motor or sensitive, which are connected with it. Thus, ac- cording to the intensity of the original stimu- lus, there will be a radiation of nervous force from the centre, either in one or two motor or sensitive nerves, or in several such ; and the number and variety of the sympathetic phenomena will thus depend on the intensity and extent of the change in the nervous centre excited by the primary stimulus. To explain, then, the phenomena of sensa- tion and motion under consideration, we must determine the individual nerves affected in each instance, and ascertain what con- nexions they have with each other. We learn from anatomical investigation, that, al- though nerves anastomose with each other in their distribution, this anastomosis is by no means of that kind which would justify the supposition that an irritation could be com- municated from one to the other in their course. The nerve-fibres only lie in juxta- position, but do not communicate ; and there is an evident provision in the tubular mem- brane and white substance of Schwann for the insulation of the central axis, which is probably the effective substance in the nervous action. We must seek, therefore, in the nervous centres for such a communication be- tween these nerves as may explain the excita- bility of one by the other. In the present state of our knowledge we can do no more than state it as in the highest degree pro- bable that nerves implanted in the centre im- mediately contiguous to each other can exert an influence upon the vesicular matter of the centre, and upon each other. But there are certain facts which demon- strate beyond all doubt, that, in such actions as we refer to, the integrity of the centre forms a necessary condition. First, in many of the instances it is plain that there can be no connexion between the affected nerves elsewhere than in the centre, for they are so distinct from each other that there is not even855 SYMPATHY. 3 i i that apparent connexion which results from the anastomosis of a fasciculus of fibres of the one with a portion of the other. Secondly, the removal of the portion of the nervous centre with which any one of the nerves concerned in the sympathetic action is connected, will prevent the development of the phenomenon, although the nerves themselves remain un- injured in their peripheral distribution, or in their connexion with each other. Thirdly, if there were any peripheral communication be- tween nerves, it would be most likely to take place in the plexuses. Experiments, how- ever, upon the nerves which lead to these show that each nerve-tube, in its passage through them, retains its isolation as dis- tinctly as in any other part of its course. The three nerves which supply the lower extremity in the frog, says Miiller, form a plexus from which two nervous trunks issue: if one of these latter be divided and isolated from all its connexions with muscles, and the portion of it connected with the plexus irri- tated, the impression will be transmitted in the centripetal direction by the sensitive fibres of nerve; but the motor fibres of the other nerve arising from the plexus are not affected, and excite no contractions in the muscles to which they are distributed.* In applying these principles to the expla- nation of the instances which we have quoted, we shall find it difficult to determine the cen- tral connexion in some, although in others such a connexion is highly probable. It re- mains, therefore, for future anatomical re- search to ascertain what that connexion is which enables one nerve to sympathise with another. In the instance of pain in the shoulder in sympathy with irritation of the liver, the hepatic irritation excites a change in some sensitive nerves, which is propagated to the centre, and there affects some of the sentient fibres distributed in the region of the shoulder. The phrenic and the external tho- racic nerves are both or either of them, but more especially the former, favourably situ- ated to constitute the excitant of such a sympathetic sensation. The phrenic nerve of the right side is largely distributed upon the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm, and upon the inferior vena cava, and forms many connexions with the hepatic plexus in the substance of the liver. It may therefore readily participate in any irritation of that organ. Now, the phrenic nerve is implanted in the spinal cord on a level with the third or fourth cervical nerves ; and the nerves of the shoulder form their connexion with this cen- tral organ about the same level. The origins of these nerves, therefore, are sufficiently contiguous to each other to warrant the be- lief that an irritated state of one may be pro- pagated to the other through the vesicular matter of the centre. But it may be inquired why the irritation is limited to sensitive nerves of the shoulder ; and why movements are not excited by the stimulation of the motor fibres of the phrenic itself, or of other * Baly's Miiller, vol. i. p. 7oG. nerves. The limitation of the irritation to one or two nerves depends on the degree of the stimulus, and the absence of any move- ments is due to the disposition of the phrenic nerve on the surface being unfavourable for the excitation of motions by irritation of its peripheral branches. And the experiment cited from Miiller, in the last paragraph, shows that simple irritation of the trunk of a compound nerve in connexion with the centre is not sufficient to produce motion ; which requires probably either a more prolonged and violent irritation of the nerve, or a polar state of the centre in which it is implanted. Some of the instances of sympathetic sen- sations, referred to above, do not admit of an explanation so obvious. The pain over the brow from ice or cold water in the stomach may be referred to irritation of the gastric branches of the vagus, communicated in the medulla oblongata to the fifth ; but why the irritation should be limited to the ophthalmic division of the fifth cannot be accounted for in the present state of our knowledge. In those sympathetic movements which are of ordinary and normal occurrence, two pro- visions seem to be secured, namely, a certain peripheral organisation of the excitor nerve, and a certain central relation between it and the motor nerve. But in those which are of a morbid kind, it is necessary to suppose the existence of a more or less exalted polarity of the centre in order to explain the pheno- mena fully. This polar state will continue in many instances even after the primary peri- pheral irritation has been removed, as in te- tanus, or in the convulsions from intestinal irritation ; and we learn from this fact the importance in practice of attending to the state of the nervous centre, as well as to the removal of the irritating cause. There are other sympathetic phenomena, of the physical kind, in which, however, the nervous system does not appear to take a prominent part. Such are the changes which occur in different and distant organs in con- nexion with a particular period of life, or the development of a particular function. Among these are the phenomena of puberty in both sexes; the enlargement of the mamma? in pregnancy. Whatever part the nervous sys- tem may take in such changes, it is impos- sible to account for them by reference to that system only ; they must rather be regarded as phenomena of nutrition occurring in har- mony with the laws of growth, and there- fore affecting the vital fluid more particularly than any part of the system of solid parts. Continuity of texture disposes, as is well known, to the extension of a diseased state originating at some one point. So also does contiguity. Phlegmonous inflammation of the areolar tissue, and erysipelas in the skin, spread with great rapidity. Inflammation arising in one of the opposed surfaces of a serous membrane readily attacks the other. These effects have been vaguely assigned to sympathy (the continuous and contiguous sym- pathy of Hunter). But it cannot be supposed856 TASTE. that the nervous system takes part in the pro- duction of such phenomena, which ought ra- ther to be ascribed, in the one case, to the continuity of blood-vessels, and, in the other, to contamination either by effused fluids or by morbid blood. (i?. B. Todd.) SYNOVIA is that fluid which exists within the membrane lining joints, to assist motion by lubrication ; as also in the bursce. The membranes generally, which line the various cavities of the body, are lubricated by fluid. This varies in character according to circum- stances ; and among these perhaps none more tend to the requirement of especial conditions than that of active and frequent motion, in- volving friction of the surfaces so lubricated. Thus we find that the fluid of the peri- cardium differs essentially from that of the ventricles of the brain ; while again the synovia, supplying moisture to the joints, varies greatly from the fluid of the pericardium, probably in order to assist the opposed surfaces in bearing friction in an exaggerated degree. The word attrition appears, indeed, the most appropriate to the conditions relieved by the presence of synovia, placed as it is between surfaces oc- casionally strongly approximated either by superincumbent weight or muscular contrac- tion. Synovia was chemically examined by Mar- gueron.* The specimen he analysed was viscid, and became gelatinous soon after it was obtained. It then deposited a fibrous matter, and became clear above. Though the analysis of Margueron was not conducted on the more exact principles characterising those of the present day, it still serves to show that the specimen was peculiar as an animal fluid, and differed in one respect from the fluids generally, which lubricate surfaces. Thus it appears that as much as 11 '86 per cent, was composed of fibrinous matter (fibrin), which coagulated, as stated before, soon after the fluid was obtained. Margueron's analysis is as follows: — Fibrin - - - - 11-86 Albumen - - 4-52 Chloride of Sodium > 1-75 Soda - - 0 71 Phosphate of'Lime - 0-70 Water - - 80-46 100- Synovia has of late years been examined by John.-f- It is described as a viscid transparent yellowish or reddish fluid, resembling in its odour the serum of the blood. The analysis is stated as follows : — Water 92-80 Albumen 6-40 Extractive Matter, Chloride of Sodium,, and Carbonate of Soda ^ 0-60 Phosphate of Lime - 0-15 * Ann, de Chimie, xiv. f Simon's Animal Chemistry. Trans. Sydenham Society. It will be seen that these two analyses vary greatly — they were not made, it must be recollected,at the same date; and the methods of animal analysis are greatly improved since Margueron published. There is, however, an important point in which both analyses agree, viz. in stating phosphate of lime among the constituents of the fluid. John makes no mention of the existence of a coagulable fibrin- ous matter ; a fact of much importance, which it appears desirable carefully to inquire into, insomuch as it is very possible the analyst may have extracted the synovia after coagulation had occurred within the membrane, and so obtained the clear fluid only; while Mar- gueron may have been fortunate enough to secure it before such change had taken place, and in its natural condition. With regard to this subject, on which our knowledge is but scanty, it appears still of importance to reflect on the material before us ; and it is matter of no small interest to •consider how far the results of peculiar me- chanical conditions are modified by variations in the character of lubricating fluids, know- ing, as we do, that, while the ventricles of the brain, subject to agitation only, contain no albumen in their lubricating fluid, the liquor of the pericardium contains that principle in abundance; and that in the synovial fluid adapted to the lubrication of the joints, we have, in addition to albumen, not only a con- siderable proponion of phosphate of lime, but probably fibrin also, as a necessary consti- tuent. (G. Owen Rees.) TASTE.—The sense by which we distin- guish the sapid properties of bodies. The term, as commonly understood, includes much more than this ; being usually employed to desig- nate the whole of that knowledge of the qualities of a body (except such as is purely tactile), which we derive through the sensory apparatus situated within the mouth. But it will be hereafter shown tnat a considerable part of this is dependent upon the assist- ance of the olfactive sense; which is affected, through the posterior nares, by the odorous emanations of all such bodies as are capable of giving them off; and the indications of which are so combined with those of the true gustative sense, as to make an apparently single impression upon the sensorium. More- over, there are certain sensorial impressions received through the organ of taste, which are so nearly allied in their character to those of touch, as to render it difficult to specify any fundamental difference between them : such are the pungent sensations produced by mus- tard, pepper, the essential oils, &c. ; all of which substances produce a sensation when applied for a sufficient length of time to any part of the cutaneous surface, which can scarcely be distinguished from that excited through the organ of taste, in any other way than by its inferior intensity, and by the ab- sence of the concurrent odorous emanations. The taste of such substances might, perhaps, be considered, therefore, as the composite re-TASTE. 857 suit of the impressions made upon the scnso- rium through a refined and acute touch, and by the effect of* their odorous emanations upon the organ of smell. After making full allow- ance, however, for all such as can be thus ac- counted for, there remains a large class of pure sapors, of which we take cognizance without the assistance of smell, and which are alto- gether dissimilar to any tactile impressions : such are the bitter of quinine, the sour of tar- taric acid, the sweet of sugar, the saline of common salt, &c. The smell can give us no assistance in distinguishing small particles of these bodies, since they are either entirely inodorous, or so nearly so as only to be recognizable through its means when in large masses ; and the most refined touch cannot afford any indication of that kind of difference among them, of which we are at once rendered cognizant by taste. Still the gustative sensa- tions scarcely differ more from the tactile than some of these last differ among each other,— the sense of heat and cold, for example, from the simple sense of contact or resistance ; and we shall find that the analogy between these two senses is so strong, both as to the con- ditions under which they are respectively ex- ercised, and the structure of the apparatus through which the impressions are received, that they must be regarded as much more nearly related to each other than either of them is to the other senses, or than the latter are amongst themselves. The seat of the sense of taste is always at the entrance to the alimentary canal; and its purpose is obviously to afford a means of dis- crimination among the substances introduced into the mouth as food. The surface of the tongue is undoubtedly the special organ of taste in the higher animals ; but there is ade- quate evidence that the sense is not entirely restricted to that organ, even in man ; and it would seem improbable, considering the ob- vious purpose of the sense, that it should be wanting in that very large proportion of the animal kingdom in which no tongue exists, or in which the surface of that organ is so hard and horny as to forbid our attributing to it the possession of gustative sensibility. Without affirming (with Magendie) that the specific gustative sensibility extends over the teeth, the gums, the palate, and the pharynx, we feel justified in stating that in most persons it is distinctly present on the surface of the soft palate, especially in the neighbourhood of the uvula, and on that of the arches of the palate and of the fauces; and in a less degree on the surface of the anterior part of the soft palate. In making experiments upon this point, as well as upon many others connected with the sense of taste, it is important to bear in mind that if aromatic substances be em- ployed, the impressions derived through the sense of smell may confuse the result; and also that if the sensory surface be too much exposed to cold air, its sensibility will be greatly diminished. Further, it should be borne in mind that a considerable amount of individual difference may not improbably exist, both as to the extent of the gustative surface, and the relative acutcness of the sense in different parts. Conditions of the Sense of Taste. — In order that gustative impressions may be communi- cated to the sensorium, the first requisite is an afferent nerve, endowed with the power of receiving and transmitting them. The gusta- tive surface in man and the higher animals being supplied by two afferent nerves, — the glosso-pharyngeal, and the lingual branch of the fifth pair,— we shall have to inquire whether both of these are subservient to the sense of taste, as well as to that of touch ; or whether, as in the case of the organs of smell, sight, and hearing, there is one nerve of special and another of general sense. The peripheral extremities of both these nerves are in relation with a papillary apparatus, in which they are elevated above the general surface, and come into close proximity with capillary loops ; and here, as elsewhere, it appears certain that the neighbourhood of cir- culating blood is an essential condition for the reception of sensory impressions. For the gustative nerve-fibres to be impressed by the distinctive properties of sapid substances, it would further seem requisite that these sub- stances should be brought into immediate relation with them, and that they should pene- trate, in the state of solution, through the investments of the papillae, into their sub- stance. This would seem to be proved by the two following facts : first, that every sub- stance which possesses a distinct taste is more or less soluble in the fluids of the mouth, whilst substances which are perfectly insoluble do not make their presence known in any other way than through the sense of touch ; and, second, that if the most sapid substance be applied in a dry state to the papillary sur- face, and this be also dry, no sensation of taste is excited. Hence it may be inferred that, in the reception of gustative impressions, a change is produced in the molecular condi- tion of the nerve-fibres, or, to use the lan- guage of Messrs. Todd and Bowman, their polarity is excited, by the direct agency of the sapid matter itself. This change may be in- duced, however, both by electrical and mecha- nical stimulation. If we make the tongue form part of a galvanic circuit, a peculiar sen- sation is excited, which is certainly allied rather to the gustative than to the tactile, and which does not seem to be due (as at one time supposed) to the decomposition of the salts of the saliva. And, as Dr. Baly has pointed out*, "if the end of the finger be made to strike quickly, but lightly, the surface of the tongue at its tip, or its edge near the tip, so as to affect not the substance of the organ, but merely the papilla;, a taste some- times acid, sometimes saline, like the taste produced by electricity, will be distinctly per- ceived. The sensation of taste thus induced will sometimes continue several seconds after the application of the mechanical stimulus." * Translation of Mailer's Physiology, p. 1062, note.TASTE. 858 On the other hand, as Wagner has truly re- marked, if the surface of the tongue near the root be touched with a clean dry glass rod, or a drop of distilled water be placed upon it, a slightly bitterish sensation is produced ; and this, if the pressure be continued, passes into that of nausea, and if the pressure be increased even excites vomiting. The feeling of nausea may be excited by mechanical irritation of any part of the surface of the fauces and soft palate ; and this feeling is certainly much more allied to that of taste than to that of touch. Further, it has been observed by Henle, that if a small current of air be di- rected upon the tongue, it gives rise to a cool saline taste like that of saltpetre. Thus we find that the peculiar effects of sapid substances upon the nerves of taste may be imitated to a certain extent by other agencies ; and it also appears that the sensations excited by these vary according to the part of the gustative surface on which they operate; me- chanical or electrical stimulation of the front of the tongue giving rise to a kind of saline taste, whilst mechanical stimulation applied to the back of the tongue and fauces excites the feelings of bitterness and nausea. One of the conditions requisite for the due exercise of the gustative sense, is a tempera- ture not departing far on either side from that which is natural to the body. It appears from the recent experiments of Prof. fi. H. Weber *, that if the tongue be kept immersed for nearly a minute in water of about 125°, the taste of sugar brought in contact with it, either in powder or solution, is no longer perceived ; the sense of touch, usually so delicate at the tip of the tongue, being also rendered imperfect. A similar imperfection of taste and touch was produced by immers- ing the tongue for the same length of time in a mixture of water and broken ice. Nerves of Tasle. — Much controversy has taken place upon the question whether or not there be a special nerve of taste ; and whether the lingual branch of the fifth pair, or the glosso-pharyngeal, possesses the best claim to this title. The principal points of this con- troversy have been already noticed [See Fifth Pair and Glosso-Pharyngeal] ; a short review of it, however, with a notice of the most recent inquiries on the subject, will be here desirable. That the glosso-p/iaryn- geal is the special nerve of taste, and that its complete section on both sides destroys the sensibility to gustative impressions, was first affirmed by Panizza; and his conclusions, adopted by Dr. M. Hall and Mr. Broughton f, have been since, to a certain extent, sup- ported by the experiments of Valentin J and Bruns.$ The grounds on which this doc- trine rests are briefly as follows: — After re- * Miiller's Archiv. 1847, S. 342. f Sixth Report of British Association; p. 125 of Transactions of Sections. % De Fuuctionibus Nervorum Ccrebralimn, &c, 1849, p. 41. § De Nervis Cetaceorum, Tub. 1830; quoted by Mtiller. covering from the depression which is the immediate consequence of the operation, a dog whose glosso-pharyngeal nerves have been divided is said to eat pieces of meat rendered bitter with colocynth, and to drink milk and water dosed with the same drug, without any repugnance; whereas if the lingual nerves be divided and the glosso-pharyngeals left entire, the bitter morsel is rejected as soon as it reaches the back of the mouth, although it may have been at first seized very hastily. But, on the contrary, it has been affirmed by Kornfeld *, with whom Miiller and Gurlt were associated, by Dr. Alcock-p, by Dr. John Reid J, by Guyot and Cazalis §, by Magendie||, by LongetIF, and by Volkmann and Bidder **, that distinct indications may be obtained of the persistence of the sense of taste, after complete section of the glosso- pharyngeal nerves on both sides. Of a dog in which the nerve had been divided before giving off a single filament, Dr. J. Reid states : — "I have repeatedly fed that dog with morsels of animal food from my hand ; and after he had taken several morsels in this way, which he readily swallowed, I then pre- sented a morsel similar in size to the others, and with the colocynth, concealed in a way that he could not see it ; but no sooner was it taken into the mouth than it was rejected with evident symptoms of disgust. This was repeated more than once." Bidder found that although two dogs whose glosso-pharyn- gei had been divided, swallowed pieces of flesh soaked in an infusion of colocynth, which another dog whose nerves were uninjured at once rejected, yet certain movements of the lips and tongue were observed, which showed that these were not altogether relished. It is obvious that, in such an inquiry, positive evidence of the continuance of the sense of taste is more conclusive than the negative evidence from which its ahsence may be in- ferred. It is right to bear in mind that, as Wagner has pointed out, dogs when they are hungry will devour meat however strongly seasoned with bitter drugs, though all their nerves be entire. Dr. Reid makes the re- mark, in explanation of the results of Panizza, that one of the dogs on which he had divided the glosso-pharyngeal nerves, would eat the morsel of meat containing colocynth, rather than lose it, when very hungry ; though he refused it, if he saw any prospect of procuring another free from the bitter. Wherever any such evidence of the persistence of the sense of taste was obtained, this appeared specially to exist in the anterior portion of the mouth. * De Fuuctionibus Nervorum Lingure Experi- menta.

The ex- periments of Dr. Alcock and others, however, appear to show that very distinct indications of gustative sensibility are presented by ani- mals in which this nerve has been divided, the sense being merely deficient in the anterior part of the tongue. On the whole, then, it may be concluded from experiment, that the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and the lingual branch of the fifth pair minister alike to the sense of taste; the for- mer being concerned in the transmission of gustative impressions from the fauces and the posterior part of the tongue, and the latter from the anterior portion of the tongue ; and the former being the special recipient of the impressions which produce the sense of nau- sea. This inference is so completely in har- mony with the results of anatomical inquiry, that it may be considered as having a very strong claim to reception as a physiological truth. The branches of the glosso-pharyn- geal appear to constitute the sole nervous supply of that region at the base of the tongue, of which the circumvallate papillae form the centre, and also of the sides of the tongue near the base. As it is universally admitted that these parts are acutely endowed with gustative sensibility, we cannot help re- garding the glosso-pharyngeal nerve as its instrument. On the other hand, the middle and anterior parts of the dorsum of the tongue appear to be solely supplied from the fifth pair, — the tip, however, receiving a branch from the glosso-pharyngeal, which runs towards it, along the under surface. It has been denied by some physiologists that the central por- tion of the upper surface possesses the proper gustative sensibility ; but we fully coincide in the statements of those who maintain the affirmative: and although it must be admitted that the sense is not so acute as it is at the base, sides, and apex of the tongue ; yet this may be fairly attributed to the greater thick- ness of the epithelial investment, and to the predominance of the conical papilla? over the fungiform in the central region. On turning to the pathological evidence which bears upon this question, we find an apparent contradiction in the phenomena re- corded by different observers; but this is in a great degree removed by a more careful ex- amination ; and the evidence on the whole preponderates in favour of the preceding con- clusions. We shall make use of the excellent summary recently put forth by Dr. J. Reid* : — " In the single cases observed and recorded by Mayo, Serrcs, Romberg, Mr. Bishop, and Todd and Bowman, and in the two cases by * Physiological, Pathological, and Anatomical Researches, p. 2G8. Mr. Dixon, both common sensation and the sense of taste were annihilated in those parts of the tongue supplied by the fifth pair ; while in one case related by Mr. Noble, and ano- ther by Vogt, common sensation was lost in the parts of the tongue supplied by the third branch of the fifth pair, yet the sense of taste remained in these parts; and in a second case related by Mr. Noble, there was loss of taste with maintenance of feeling." In some of these cases the loss of the sense of taste ap- peared to extend to the base of the tongue; but there was evidence that in these the glosso-pharyngeal nerve was also involved in the paralysis. " We have no proof," con- tinues Dr. Reid, " that in the cases related by Mr. Noble and Vogt, the whole of the fila- ments of the fifth pair sent to the tongue were affected; and in the case of Vogt the derangement of the nerve was only tempo- rary, for the patient recovered the sensation of the part paralysed after the end of six weeks. We believe that these cases, when examined more closely, will rather be regard- ed as affording arguments in favour of the opinion, that the same nervous filaments do not convey inwards the impressions which excite pain and touch and the impressions which excite taste ; and that different fila- ments for conveying inwards the impressions that excite these sensations are bound up in the lingual branch of the fifth pair." There is believed to be no case on record, in which the whole of the fifth pair, or of the third branch of it, was found to be diseased after death, and in which, during life, the sense of taste had been retained in the anterior and middle parts of the tongue. The evidence of pathology, therefore, is in favour of that con- clusion, as to the participation of the fifth pair with the glosso-pharyngeal in the sense of taste, at which we had arrived on other grounds. The question still remains, however, as to the speciality of the nervous fibres which con- vey the gustative impressions ; that is, whether they are the common sensory fibres, whose peculiarity of function depends on the nature of the papillary apparatus at their peripheral origin; or whether they are incapable, like the fibres of the olfactive, optic, and auditory- nerves, of conveying impressions of the ordi- nary sensorial kind, being adapted exclusively to receive and transmit the peculiar impres- sions made by sapid bodies. Now, in favour of the first view, it may be urged, that the conditions of the sense of taste are so nearly allied to those required for the exercise of touch, that the two can scarcely be dis- tinguished on this ground, and that the fifth pair and the glosso-pharyngeal are both nerves of common as well as of gustative sensibility ; neither of which can be affirmed in regard to the three other senses, or of the nerves which minister to them. But, on the other hand, it must be remarked, that these nerves do not seem to be endowed with gustative and com- mon sensibility in equal proportions ; for the glosso-pharyngeal, which is decidedly moreTASTE. 860 susceptible than the lingual to gustative im- pressions, far less readily excites manifesta- tions of pain when subjected to mechanical irritation. Hence, it would seem not im- probable, that there may be in each a mixture of the fibres which minister to the sense of taste with those of tactile sensibility; and that the former may be so far special in their endowments, as to be capable of receiving only the peculiar impressions made by sapid bodies, to which the latter may be insensible. Such a view would seem to be supported by the cases of Vogt and Noble just referred to ; and it is in harmony with the views to which we are led from the consideration of the diversities manifested between the sense of heat and cold and that of simple contact. [See Touch.] Gustative Papilla;.—The tongue is copiously furnished with a papillary structure, bearing a close resemblance to that of the skin, but in many respects more complicated. Re- ferring to the article Tongue for a more par- ticular anatomical description of these papillae, we have now to inquire into their connexion with the sense of taste. According to the recent investigations of Messrs. Todd and Bowman, the lingual papilla? are either simple or compound ; the former, which do not differ from those of the cutaneous surface in any other obvious character than the nature of their epithelial investment, are scattered over the whole surface of the tongue, in parts where the others do not exist, but they also par- ticipate in the formation of the compound papillae ; the latter are of three kinds, the cir- cumvallate or calyciform, the fungiform, and the conical.—The civcumvaUatc papillae, which are only eight or ten in number, and are restricted to a small space at the base of the tongue, consist merely of groups of simple papilla;, arranged in a peculiar manner, and separated from those of the adjacent mucous membrane by a circular fissure. Into these simple papillae it has not yet been found possible to trace any distinct nerve-fibres, though there can be little doubt that it is penetrated by at least the essential part of them.—The fungiform papillae are scattered singly over the surface, chiefly about the sides and apex, and but very sparingly in the middle of the dorsal region, though they are abundant in front of the cir- cumvallate papillae. These are composed^ of aggregations of simple papillae, which rise, however, considerably above the surface, and are covered with an epithelium so thin that they are distinguished by their blood-red colour. Fasciculi of nerve-tubes may be dis- tinctly traced into them ; but of the nature of their termination it would be unwise to give a positive statement. Some of the ap- pearances presented by them favour the idea that they form loops at their peripheral ex- tremities ; whilst, in other instances, the tu- bular portion of the fibre, with the white substance of Schwann, seems to terminate somewhat abruptly, whilst the central axis is continued onwards into the substance of the enveloping t'ssue, in which it loses itself. —The conical or filiform, which are the most numerous of the compound papillae, are dif- fused over the whole surface of the tongue, though most largely and numerously de- veloped in its central part. They consist of clusters of simple papillae of a peculiarly elongated form, containing tubular nerve- fibres, which may frequently be seen to form distinct loops in their interior; but their chief peculiarity consists in their epithelial invest- ment, which forms about two-thirds of their length, and gives to them their whitish tint. This investment consists of a tuft of long pointed processes, some of which present a near approach in their dense texture to hair ; whilst others may be regarded as soft or un- condensed hairs. These processes are sent off from the sides and summits of the secondary papillae, and are usually inclined backwards, lying buried in the recesses of the mouth. The foregoing description applies, however, only to the conical papillae of the human tongue ; and there is a considerable diversity in their structure in other animals. Thus, in the Ruminants, each conical papilla is ter- minated by a long, slender, flexible, horny filament, curving backwards ; and in the Fe- lines some of them are furnished with a brush- like tuft of slender horny filaments, like those of man*, whilst others are encased by firm horny sheaths, which are prolonged backwards as stiff spines. It is to this arrangement that the peculiar roughness of the tongue of the cat is clue ; the organ being thus enabled to act as a flexible rasp, whereby the bones which they lick may be effectually cleaned of the smallest particles of flesh that may adhere to them ; and a single stroke of the tongue of a lion is said to be capable of abrading the whole thickness of the human skin. After what lias been already said of the conditions essential to the exercise of the sense of taste, there is no occasion to do more than point out the evident fact, that, if some of the papillae be covered with an epi- thelial investment so dense as to resemble horn, and offering an effectual barrier to the penetration of fluids, these cannot be sup- posed to have much participation in the sense, if they possess any. It is obvious that in the Felines the function of the spiny pa- pillae must be purely mechanical; and it seems probable that the brush-like papillae which lie among them, in common with those of man, possess simple tactile sensibility, serving to direct those muscular actions of the organ, which so remarkably adapt it to deal with minute particles of food. On the other hand, the thinness of the epithelial investment on the simple papillae which are scattered over the surface of the tongue, and which form the circumvallate and fungiform papillae by their aggregation, indicates their special adaptation to receive gustative impressions ; and this must be admitted to be more especially the case with the fungiform papillae, which often * By Cuvier these filaments are supposed to lie the ultimate fasciculi of the fibres of the gustative nerve; but this is certainly an error.801 TASTE. undergo a kind of erection when sapid sub- stances are brought into contact with them. This inference is in complete harmony with the relative acuteness of the senses of taste and touch, in the portions of the surface on which the one or the other class of papillae is most abundant; thus the sides and back part of the tongue are unquestionably the parts where the gustative sensibility is the greatest, and it is there that the fungiform, circumvallate, and simple papillae are most thickly set; whilst the apex and central part of the dorsum, over which the tactile sensi- bility is predominant, is that on which we meet with the largest number of filiform papillae. Whether there be any difference among the simple isolated papillae, and among those which are aggregated into the com- posite bodies that are termed fungiform and circumvallate, we are scarcely in a con- dition even to form a guess, until it shall have been determined whether the gustative and tactile nerve-fibres are identical or diverse in their endowments. If the former, it will be reasonable to suppose that every papilla through which a gustative impression can be made in virtue of the penetration of sapid matter into its tissue, may also be subservient to the reception of tactile impressions from mechanical stimulation. On the other hand, if it should be proved that the gustative sense depends on a special set of fibres, we should still have to inquire whether the same papilla may not contain fibres of both classes, so as to minister to both functions ; or whether some of the papillae are purely gustative, whilst others are purely tactile. At present there is no adequate reason to suppose that there is any essential difference of function among the papillae covered with a soft thin epithelium, whether these be solitary or aggregate. An attempt was made by Horn * to establish some such diversity ; but the results of his experiments would rather lead to the supposition that there is a dif- ference in the gustative sensations excited by the same substance, according as it is applied to different regions of the tongue, than to different papillae. Thus he found that more than three-fourths of the substances which he applied to the circumvallate papillae excited a bitter taste, or one in which a bitter was associated with some other flavour, especi- ally an alkaline or saline ; whilst the majority of the substances applied to the filiform papillae tasted acid, or acid with a mixture of bitter and sweet. But since, as we have seen, mere mechanical stimulation produces different gustative sensations according to the part of the tongue to which it is applied, it is probable that the difference in Horn's results is not to be set down to the account of the papillae, but rather to that of the nerves by which they are respectively supplied. Exercise of the Sense. — The simple appli- cation of a sapid substance to the gustative surface is usually sufficient to excite the sen- * Ueber den Geschmacksimi des Menschen. Hei- delberg, 1825. sation ; and if this application be restricted to one particular spot, we are able to recog- nise its place more or less distinctly. In this respect, then, the gustative impression resem- bles the tactile ; for whilst we cannot, by our own consciousness, distinguish the parts of the retina or of the auditory apparatus on which visual or auditory impressions are made, we can make this distinction in regard to the surface which is supplied by the nerves of general sense. This determination is most precise when the impression is made on the parts of the tongue of which the gus- tative sensibility is most acute ; namely, the apex, sides, and posterior part of the dorsum; being probably aided, however, near the tip, by the acuteness of its tactile sensibility. The impressibility of the middle portion of the dorsum is greatly inferior; but still, when the gustative sensation has been excited there, it is referred to the spot on which the sapid substance was laid. The contact of sapid substances much more readily excites a gustative sensation, when it is made to press upon the papillae, or to move over them. Thus there are some substances whose taste is not perceived when they are simply applied to the central part of the dorsum of the tongue, but of whose presence we are at once rendered cognizant by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth. The full flavour of a sapid substance, again, is more readily perceived when it is rubbed on any part of the tongue, than when it is simply brought in contact with it or pressed against it. Even when liquids are taken into the mouth, their taste is most completely discri- minated by causing them to move over the gustative surface: thus the "wine-taster" takes a small quantity of the liquor into his mouth, carries it rapidly over every part of its lining membrane, and then ejects it. It is not improbable that this exaltation of the usual effects is simply due to mechanica causes ; the sapid particles being brought by the pressure or movement into more rapid and complete operation on the nerve-fibres than they would be if simply placed in con- tact with the papillae. As in the case of the other senses, so do we find with regard to that of taste, that continual attention to its indications greatly increases its acuteness. Thus the "tasters" of wine, tea, &c., acquire a power of discrimi- nation which is truly wonderful to those who have not exercised themselves in the same manner. Thus we have been informed that the "taster" to one of the extensive cellars of sherry wines at Cadiz or Seville has not the least difficulty in distinguishing the butt from which a given sample may have been drawn, although the number of different va- rieties of the same kind of wine under his keeping may not be less than five hundred. So we are informed by Dr. Kitchener that many London epicures are capable of saying in what precise reach of the Thames the salmon on the table has been caught; and the Parisian gourmet is said to be able to distin-TASTE. 862 guish by the taste, whether the birds on which he is dining are domesticated or wild, male or female, or to give an exact determination of the spices, &c, that are combined in a parti- cular sauce. On the other hand, the power of distin- guishing sapors is for a time suspended, when several substances of very decided but dif- ferent tastes are taken into the mouth in quick succession : thus, if sweet, sour, salt, or bitter substances be applied to the tongue, or if different kinds of wine be taken, one after another, the sense is so much blunted after a short time, as to impair or destroy the power of discrimination between them until after an interval of rest. So, again, when two sub- stances of very different flavours are mingled together, the stronger will frequently mask the presence of the weaker: thus we often find it advantageous, in prescribing nauseous medicines, to combine with them aromatics, whose stronger impression shall take posses- sion (so to speak) of the sense for a time ; and the object may be still more completely attained by giving the aromatic a moment or two previously, instead of simultaneously with the disagreeable substance. The influence of habit in blunting the sen- sibility to particular tastes, is as remarkable as it is in the case of other sensations. Still more extraordinary, however, is the degree in which the taste may be educated to approve savours which are in the first instance most disgusting. "Thus," says Dr. Dunglison*, " the Roman liquamen or garum, the most celebrated sauce of antiquity, was prepared from the half-putrid intestines of fish : and one of the varieties of the Ottoq at\tt>tov, or laserpitium, is supposed to have been the assafbetida. Even at this time, certain of the Orientals are fond of the flavour of this nauseous substance. Putrid meat is the de- light of some nations ; and a rotten egg, es- pecially if accompanied with the chick, is highly esteemed by the Siamese. In civilised countries, we find game, in a putrescent state, eaten as a luxury ; this, to those unaccus- tomed to it, requires a true education. The same may be said of the pickled olive, and of several cheeses ; the jromage de Gruyere, for example, so much esteemed by the inhabitants of continental Europe." Very extraordinary appetencies for particular flavours are some- times morbidly developed; as in the case of chlorotic girls, pregnant women, and insane patients. The latter will sometimes even devour their own excrement. Independently of the changes produced by the education of the taste, we find great al- terations in the likes and dislikes connected with it, taking place in accordance with the development of the body, or with other changes in its physiological conditions. Thus to the infant there is obviously nothing so agreeable as milk ; in more advanced child- hood there is almost invariably a fondness for sweets ; whilst after adult age this is usually in a great degree superseded by a preference * Human Physiology, vol. i. p. 116. for other savours. It sometimes happens that articles of diet which were peculiarly agree- able to us in childhood, become positively disgusting to us in later life; whilst, on the contrary, many things to which we feel a strong distaste in childhood, are relished when we come to be men, and this by a sponta- neous change in our own appetencies. We fully believe with Wagner that these altera- tions are in some way connected with the physical condition of the nutritive functions ; for we have other examples in which this connexion is very evident. Thus, we may continually remark that articles of food for which we have the keenest relish when we commence a meal with a good appetite, be- come positively distasteful when we have al- ready satisfied it. Again, we have known per- sons who have a positive repugnance to fatty or oleaginous matters of almost any description, so long as they reside in temperate climates, but who eat them with avidity when exposed to the severe cold of the arctic winter. And even in our own country we may frequently remark that the taste for such articles varies with the temperature; a cup of sweet olea- ginous cocoa, which would be almost loathed on a hot summer day, being very palatable on a cold winter night j whilst ascescent drinks, such as would be greatly relished in the former season, are altogether discarded in the latter, except when a heated atmosphere brings back the physical condition of the system which renders them palatable. So, again, we often observe in illness that an alteration in the physical conditions of the system so far affects the sense of taste, as to produce a great alteration in the usual appe- tencies. These alterations may probably be due in some instances to the depravation of the buccal secretions, so that the gustative papillae are constantly surrounded with a sub- stance possessing a certain taste of its own, which of course affects their impressibility by other savours. But there can be little doubt that they are more commonly occasioned by alterations in the condition of the gustative apparatus itself, which becomes the exponent (so to speak) of the wants of the system, and which may be trusted, to a very considerable extent, as indicating what is really most de- sirable for it. Thus Dr. Holland remarks * : —" In the majority of instances of actual illness, provided the real feelings of the pa- tient can be safely ascertained, his desires as to food and drink may be safely complied with. But undoubtedly much care is need- ful that we be not deceived as to the state of the appetites by what is merely habit or wrong impression on the part of the patient, or the effect of the solicitation of others. This class of sensations is more nurtured out of the course of nature than are those which relate to the temperature of the body. The mind becomes much more deeply engaged with them ; and though in acute illness they are generally submitted again to the natural law, there are many lesser cases where * Medical Notes and Reflections, p. 85.TASTE. 86'3 enough remains of the leaven of habit to render every precaution needful. With such precautions, however, which every physician who can take schooling from experience will employ, the stomach of the patient becomes a valuable guide ; whether it dictate abstinence from a recurrence to food ; whether much or little in quantity; whether what is solid or liquid; whether much drink or little; whe- ther things warm or cold ; whether sweet, acid, or saline; whether bland or stimulating to the taste." Further, Dr. Holland remarks : " It is not wholly paradoxical to say that we are authorised to give greatest heed to the stomach when it suggests some seeming ex- travagance of diet. It may be that this is a mere depravation of the sense of taste ; but frequently it expresses an actual need of the stomach either in aid of its own functions or indirectly (under the mysterious law just re- ferred to) for the effecting of changes in the whole mass of blood. It is a good practical rule in such cases to withhold assent till we find after a certain lapse of time that the same desire continues or strongly recurs ; in which case it may generally be taken as the index of the fitness of the thing desired for the actual state of the organs. In the early stage of recovery from long gastric fevers, I recollect many curious instances of such contrariety to all rule being acquiesced in, with manifest good to the patient. Dietetics must become a much more exact branch of knowledge, before we can be justified in opposing its maxims to the natural and repeated sugges- tions of the stomach, in the state either of health or disease." In regard to the use of wine in fever, it is universally admitted by prac- tical physicians that very important indica- tions may frequently be drawn from the appe- tency or dislike manifested towards it by the patient; this being often exhibited when there is an almost entire obtuseness of the mind in regard to all other external impressions. In such circumstances these dormant instincts seem to manifest themselves, which are kept under by the intelligence in the normal con- dition; instincts akin to those which guide the lower animals in their choice of food. There is probably not a plant, however poisonous to most, which has not one or more species of animal specially adapted to derive from it wholesome nutriment, and which is obviously drawn to it by its odour or savour ; whilst the most omnivorous feeders, such as the monkey, are usually restrained by dislikes, excited through these same senses, from touching fruits which would be noxious to them. It cannot be doubted that, in all persons of ordinary aptitude for the discrimination of flavours, there are certain natural harmonies and discords among these, as among colours and sounds ; so that particular substances of very different flavours taste agreeably in com- bination, whilst others are mutually repug- nant. Thus every body likes sugar in combi- nation with the acid of fruits ; and the sugar is popularly believed to neutralise the acid, which (as we need scarcely say) is not at all the case. On the other hand, sugar and oysters are said to form one of the most nauseous combinations possible. So, again, the flavour of many wines is improved by being tasted simultaneously with cheese, whilst it is injured by fruits.—The art of cookery is founded upon a knowledge of these facts, which have not yet perhaps received from the scientific physiologist the systematic atten- tion they deserve. Attempts have been made by Linnseus, Boerhaave, and others, to form a classification of savours ; but no such clas- sification has come into general use, although there are certain savours which all agree to consider primary; such as the aromatic, the sweet, the acid, the bitter, the saline, the astringent, and the pungent. By the first of these the sense of taste is connected with that of smell; by the last two with that of touch. The impressions made upon the sense of taste seem to remain longer after the with- drawal of the body that excited them, than those which are received through most of our other senses. This is not surprising, when it is considered that particles of the sapid sub- stance, which have once penetrated the pa- pillae, may linger there in contact with the sentient extremities of the nerves, for some little time after they have passed away from the external surface. In many cases, how- ever, the substance leaves an after-taste which is different from that which it first excited. It is difficult to say how much of this may be due to the difference of the impression which is made upon the sensory papilla at the front of the tongue and upon those at its base, and also to the admixture of the olfactive sense, which will be most actively called into play as the sapid body is passing the fauces; and how much to the exhaustion of the nerves conse- quent upon their previous stimulation, so that the after-taste is complementary to that first received. It certainly appears to confirm the former explanation, that the after-taste is generally of that bitterish character which we have seen to be produced by the mere me- chanical stimulation of the papilla? at the base of the tongue. On the other hand, the fact that tannin, one of the bitterest substances known, has a sweetish after-taste, seems to favour the latter view. Probably both causes may participate in the production of the re- sult. It is not very common to find the sense of taste excited in a purely subjective manner; since many of the tastes which are experienced in disease are probably due, as already re- marked, to the depravation of the buccal secretions. Nevertheless, we occasionally meet with instances in which some peculiar gustative sensation, usually of a disagreeable nature, is constantly experienced without being traceable to any such cause; and in which, therefore, we must seek for its occasion in some disordered functional condition of the sensorium. The purpose °f the sense of taste is obviously to serve as the guide and attraction towards864 TEETH. wholesome food, and to afford pleasure in the reception of it, whilst it deters from the use of such as would be deleterious. This is more obvious in the lower animals than it is in man, who is frequently led by habit and fashion to a preference for substances which are high- flavoured over those which are most whole- some, and who is still more frequently induced to gratify his gustative sense by the reception of an amount of food which appetite alone would not incite him to take in. Of the pernicious results of such excess, this is not the place to speak. The only ulterior purposes which the sense of taste appears to perform in the economy, are to aid in exciting the flow of saliva, and in certain cases to excite the act of vomiting. Although the secretion of saliva is greatly affected by other causes, — as, for example, by the movement of the jaws, tongue, &c,—yet it is much influenced by the sapid qualities of the food introduced into the mouth, being greatly increased by the taste of savoury food. It is also augmented by the sight or odour of such food ; but it is probable that the latter sensations influence it not so much directly as indirectly, namely, through the ideas which they call up, for the idea alone, if called up with sufficient vividness, is sufficient to make " the mouth water." The sense of nausea, as already remarked, seems intermediate between taste and touch; but it is connected most closely with the former. We experience more or less of difficulty in swallowing all substances whose taste is peculiarly repugnant to us, and we find ourselves compelled to regurgitate them when the impression becomes of a certain intensity. This is one of the auto- matic actions in which it appears requisite that a sensation, not a mere impression, should participate. ( William B. Carpenter?) TEETH.—Comparative Anatomy.(Sing. a tooth ; Tunth, Teut.; Dens, Lat.; Dente, Ital.; Dent, Fr.; Tand, Dan. ; Tain, Old English ; Zahn, Germ. ; Hard, Welsh ; Dend, Erse; odovg-oSovrog, Gr.; Dantis, Lithuanic; Dantas, Sanscrit.*) A tooth is a hard body attached to the mouth or commencement of the alimentary canal, always exposed, save where its develop- ment is permanently arrested, as in the rudi- mental tusk of the Narwhal; commonly cal- cified, the exceptions being few, e. g., the horny teeth of the Lamprey and Platypus. Teeth vary not only in their tissue, but still more in number, size, form, structure, position, and mode of attachment, in different animals : they are principally adapted for seizing, tear- ing, dividing, pounding, or grinding the food ; in some they are modified to serve as wea- pons of offence and defence; in others as aids in locomotion, means of anchorage, instru- * These synonyms are cited as illustrative of the coincidence in one of the primary words of a natural class of languages that prevails from the East Indies, through the west of Asia and across Europe, and as indicative of the unity of stock of the great Indo- European family of mankind. ments for uprooting or cutting down trees, or for transport and working of building materials; they are characteristic of age and sex; and in man they have secondary rela- tions subservient to beauty and to speech. Teeth are always most intimately related to the food and habits of the animal, and are therefore highly interesting to the physiolo- gist : they form for the same reason most important guides to the naturalist in the classification of animals ; and their value, as zoological characters, is enhanced by the facility with which, from their position, they can be examined in living or recent animals ; whilst the durability of their tissues renders them not less available to the palaeontologist in the determination of the nature and affi- nities of extinct species, of whose organisation they are often the sole remains discoverable in the deposits of former periods of the earth's history. Although there are many analogous struc- tures in the inverterbrate classes, true calcified teeth are peculiar to the Vertebrata, and may be defined as bodies primarily, if not perma- nently, distinct from the skeleton, consisting of a cellular and tubular basis of animal matter containing earthy particles, a fluid, and a vascular pulp. In general, the earth is present in such quantity as to render the tooth harder than bone, in which case the animal basis is gela- tinous, as in other hard parts where a great proportion of earth is combined with animal matter. In a very few instances among the vertebrate animals, the hardening material exists in a much smaller proportion, and the animal basis is albuminous ; the teeth here agree, in both chemical and physical qualities, with horn. True teeth consist commonly of two or more tissues, characterised by the proportions of their earthy and animal constituents, and by the size, form, and direction of the cavities in the animal basis which contain the earth, the fluid, or the vascular pulp. The tissue which forms the body of the tooth is called "dentine," (Dentinum, Lat.; Zahnbein, Zahnsubstanz, Germ.; VIvoire*, Fr.) The tissue which forms the outer crust of the tooth is called '' cement" (ccementum, crusta jietrosa, Lat.). * The learned author of the article " Secretions," in the " Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Naturelle," 8vo, 1848, adopts the term " Dentine " in preference to Cuvier's name " ivoire," and after denning its properties, observes, " Sur ces divers rapports, le mot dentine, par lequel M. E. Owen les de'signe, me parait tres heureux." The term " ivory " unavoid- ably recalls the idea of the peculiar modification of " dentine," which characterises the tusks of the ele- phant, mammoth, and mastodon; but, besides this objection to its more general application, the word is used in a still wider sense in the " Leeons d'Ana- tomie Comparee: " " Les unes (dents), en effet, ont la partie enfoncee dans l'alve'ole de'nuee d'email; cette partie, ou la racine, ne se compose ge'ne'ralement que de Vivoire interieure, recouvert tres rarement (Vivoire exterieure (les dents de cachalot) ;" torn. iv. Ed. posth. 1836, p. 200. The example cited of the tissue here denominated " ivoire exte'rieure " is the " cement." See my " Odontography," p. 355, pi. 89.865 TEETH. The third tissue, when present, is situated between the dentine and cement, and is called " enamel" (encaustum, adamas, Lat.). "Dentine" consists of an organised animal basis disposed in the form of extremely minute tubes and cells, and of earthy particles : these particles have a twofold arrangement, being either blended with the animal matter of the interspaces and parietes of the tubes and cells, or contained in a minutely granular state in their cavities. The density of the dentine arises principally from the proportion of earth in the first of these states of combination, the tubes and cells contain, besides the granular earth, a colourless fluid, probably transuded " plasma" or "liquor sanguinis," and thus re- late not only to the mechanical conditions of the tooth, but to the vitality and nutrition of the dentine. This typical structure of dentine is well illustrated in the article Tooth : such " true dentine "has no canals large enough to ad- mit capillary vessels with the red particles of blood, and it has been therefore called "un- vascular dentine." The simplest modification of dentine is that in which capillary tracts of the primitive vas- cular pulp remain uncalcified, and permanently carry red blood into the substance of the tissue. These so-called " medullary canals " or " vascular canals " present various disposi- tions in the dentine which they modify, and which I have proposed to call " vaso-dentine." It is often combined with true dentine in the same tooth ; e.g. in the scalpriform incisors of certain Rodents*, the tusks of the Ele- phant f, the molars of the extinct Iguanodon.J A third modification of the fundamental tissue of the tooth is where the cellular basis of the dentine is arranged in concentric layers around the vascular canals, and contains " ra- diated cells " like those of the osseous tissue : it is called " osteo-dentine." The transition from dentine to vaso-dentine, and from this to osteo-dentine, is gradual, and the resemblance of osteo-dentine to true bone is very close. "Cement" always closely corresponds in texture with the osseous tissue of the same animal ; and wherever it occurs of sufficient thickness, as upon the teeth of the horse, sloth, or ruminant, it is also traversed, like bone, by vascular canals. In reptiles and mammals, in which the animal basis of the bones of the skeleton is excavated by minute radiated cells, forming with their contents the " corpuscles of Purkinje," these are likewise present, of similar size and form, in the " cement," and are its chief characteristic as a constituent of the tooth. The hardening ma- terial of the cement is partly segregated and combined with the parietes of the radiated cells and canals, and is partly contained in disgregated granules in the cells, which are thus rendered white and opaque, viewed by reflected light. The relative density of the dentine and cement varies according to the * Odontography, 4to, p. 405. t lb. p. 043. t lb. p. 251. VOL. IV. proportion of the earthy material, and chiefly of that part which is combined with the- animal matter in the walls of the cavities, as compared with the size and number of the cavities themselves. In the complex grinders of the elephant, the masked boar, and the capybara, the cement, which forms nearly half the mass of the tooth, wears down sooner than the dentine. The "enamel'" is the hardest constituent of a tooth, and, consequently, the hardest of animal tissues; but it consists, like the other dental substances, of earthy matter arranged by organic forces in an animal matrix. Here, however, the earth is mainly contained in the canals of the animal membrane; and, in mammals and reptiles, completely fills those canals, which are comparatively wide, whilst their parietes are of extreme tenuity. The hardening salts of the enamel are not only present in far greater proportion than in the other dental tissues; but, in some animals, are peculiarly distinguished by the presence of fluate of lime. The following are characteristic examples of the above defined tissues, and their different combinations, in different teeth. The examples are extremely few, and, as far as I know, are peculiar to the class Pisces, of calcified teeth which consist of a single tissue, and this is always a modification of dentine. The large pharyngeal teeth of the Wrasse (Labriis) consist of a very hard kind of unvascular dentine. .Fig. 544. shows aver- Fig. 544.

The next stage of complexity is where a portion of the dentine is modified by vascular canals. Teeth, thus composed of dentine and vaso-dentine, are very common in fishes. The hard dentine is always external, and holds the place, and perforins the office, of enamel in the teeth of higher animals ; hut it is only analogous to enamel, not the same 3 KTEETH. 866 tissue.* Fig. 545. illustrates this structure in a longitudinal section of a tooth of a shark of Fig. 545.

The molars of the Dugong are examples of teeth com- posed of dentine and cement, the latter tissue forming a thick external layer. Fig. 546.

In the great teeth of the lower jaw of the Cachalot, the pulp-cavity of the growing tooth becomes filled up by osteo-dentine, the result of a modified calci- fication of the dentinal pulp ; and the full- grown tooth presents three tissues, as shownTEETH. 8G7 3 k 2 in Jig. 5V/., in which c is the thick external cement, d the hard dentine, and o the osteo- dentine ; sometimes developed in loose stalac- titic-shaped nodules. In the teeth of the Sloth, and its great extinct congener, the Megatherium, the hard dentine is reduced to a thin layer, and the chief bulk of the tooth is made up of a central body of vaso-dentine, and a thick ex- ternal crust of cement.

The hard dentine is, of course, the firmest tissue of a tooth so composed, and forms the crest of the transverse ridges of the grinding surface, like the enamel plates in the elephant's grinder. It has, consequently, been described to be enamel *, but its relation to that tissue is only one of analogy or function. The human teeth, ami those of the carni- vorous mammals, appear at first sight to be composed of dentine and enamel only, as they were described to be by the Cuviersf, who * Cuvier, Ossemens Fossiles, 4to, t. v., pt. 1., p. 172.; and Clift, Transactions of the Geological Society, 1835, p. 438. t F.

There is also commonly a small central tract of osteo-dentine in old teeth. In Jig. 7, pi. 122, of my Odontography is given a longitudinal section of a human molar tooth, in which d is the dentine, c the enamel, and c the cement. The teeth, called by Cuvier compound or complex in Mammalia, differ, as regards their composition, from the preceding, only by the different proportion and disposition of the constituent tissues.

Section of incisor of a Home (JSquus), A very complex tooth may be formed out of two tissues by the way in which these may be interblended, as the result of an original complex disposition of the constituents of the dental matrix. Certain fishes, and a singular family of gigantic extinct Batrachians, which I have called " Labyrinthodonts,"* exhibit, as the name implies, a remarkable instance of this kind of complexity. Fig. 551. is a view of a canine tooth of the Labyrinthodon salaman- droides, of the natural size : and Jig. 552. is a slightly magnified view of a transverse section across the part of the crown marked a. At first view, the tooth appears to be of the simple conical kind, with the exterior surface merely striated longitudinally, but every streak is a fissure into which the very thin external laver of cement (c) is reflected into the body* of * Proceedings of the Geological Society, Jan 20. 1841, p. 257.TEETH. 868 Fig. 550.

The inflected fold of cement c runs straight for about half a line, and then becomes wavy, the waves rapidly increasing in breadth as they recede from the periphery of the tooth ; the first two, three, or four undulations are simple; then their contour itself becomes broken by smaller or secondary waves ; these become stronger as the fold approaches the centre of the tooth, when it increases in thickness, and finally terminates by a slight dilatation or loop close to the pulp-cavity, from which the free margin of the inflected fold of cement is separated by an extremely thin layer of dentine. The number of the inflected converging folds of dentine is about fifty at the middle of the crown of the tooth figured, but is greater at the base. All the inflected folds of cement at the base of the tooth have the same complicated disposition with increased extent; but, as they approach their termination towards the upper part of the tooth, they also gradually diminish in breadth, and consequently penetrate to a less distance into the substance of the tooth. Hence, in such a section as is delineated (fig- 552.), it will be observed that some of the convoluted folds, as those marked cc, extend near to the centre of the tooth; others, as those marked c', reach only about half-way to the centre; and those folds, c", which, to use a geological expression, are " cropping Fig. 551. £ Tooth of a Labyrinthodon, natural size. out," penetrate to a very short distance into the dentine, and resemble, in their extent and Fig. 552. Transverse section of tooth of Labyrinthodon. (Magnified.') simplicity, the converging folds of cement in the fangs of the tooth of the Ichthyosnurus. The disposition of the dentine is still more complicated than that of the cement. It con- sists of a slender, central, conical column, excavated by a conical pulp-cavity for a cer-869 TEETH. tain distance from the base of the tooth; and this column sends radiating outwards, from its circumference, a series of vertical plates, which divide into two once or twice before they terminate at the periphery of the tooth. Each of these diverging and dichotomising plates gives off'throughout its course smaller processes, which stand at right angles, or nearly so, to the main plate ; they are gene- rally opposite, but sometimes alternate; many of the secondary plates or processes, which are given off'near the centre of the tooth, also divide into two before they terminate; and their contour is seen, in the transverse section, to partake of all the undulations of the folds of cement which invest and divide the den- tinal plates and processes from each other. The dental pulp-cavity is reduced to a mere line about the upper third of the tooth, but throughout its whole extent fissures radiate from it, corresponding in number with the radiating plates of dentine. Each fissure is continued along the middle of each plate, dividing where this divides, and extending along the middle of each bifurcation and pro- cess to within a short distance of the line of cement. The pulp-fissure commonly dilates into a canal at the origin of the lateral pro- cesses of the radiating plates, before it divides to accompany and penetrate those processes. The main fissures or radiations of the pulp- cavity extend to within a line or half a line of the periphery of the tooth, and suddenly dilate at their terminations into spaces, which, in transverse section, arc subcircular, oval, or rally smaller spaces. All these spaces, or canals, in the living tooth, must have been occupied by corresponding processes of the vascular pulp : they constitute so many cen- tres of radiation of the fine calcigerous tubes, which, with their uniting clear substance, constitute the dentine.* An analogous complexity is produced by numerous fissures radiating from a central mass of vaso-dentinc, which more or less fills up the pulp-cavity of the seemingly simple conical teeth of the extinct family of fishes which I have called " Dendrodonts."f Fig. 553. is one of these fossil teeth, of the natu- Tooili of a Dendrodus, natural size. ral size ; a a transverse section ; and fig. 554 a reduced view of a portion of the same section, enlarged twenty diameters.

In the transverse section these processes are seen to be connected together by a net-work of smaller medullary canals belonging to a coarse osseous texture into which the pulp has been converted, and this structure occupies the middle half of the section. All the medullary canals were filled by the opaque matrix. From the circumference of the central net- work, straight medullary fissures radiate at pretty regular intervals to the periphery of the tooth : most of these canals divide once, rarely twice, in their course; the division taking place sometimes at their origin, in others at different distances from their termi- nations, and the branches diverge slightly as they proceed. Each of the above medullary fissures is continued from a short process of the central structure, which is connected by a concave line with the adjoining process, so that the whole periphery of the transverse section of the central coarse reticulo-medul- lary body of the tooth presents a crenate out- line. From each ray and its primary dicho- tomous divisions, short branches are sent off at brief intervals, generally at right angles with the trunk, or slightly inclined towards the periphery of the tooth. These subdivide into a few short ramifications, like the branches of a shrub, and terminate in irregular and somewhat angular dilatations, simulatingleaves, but which resolve themselves into radiating fasciculi of calcigerous tubes. There are from fifteen to twenty-five or thirty-six of these short and small lateral branches on each side of the medullary rays. A third kind of complication is produced by an aggregation of many simple teeth into a single mass. The examples of these truly compound teeth * are most common in the class of Fishes, but the illustration here selected is from the Mammalian class. Each tooth of the Cape Ant-eater (Orycteropus) presents a simple form, is deeply set in the jaw, but without dividing into fangs; its broad and flat base is porous, like the section of a com- mon cane. The canals to which these pores lead contain processes of a vascular pulp, and are the centres of radiation of as many indc- * In the " Lemons d'Anatomie Comparee" of Cuvier, the teeth, in which folds of enamel and cement penetrate the entire substance of the crown, are called " compound:" " Nous appellons ' dent compose'e' celle dont les diff'e'rentes substances forment des replis tellement profonds, que dans quelque sens qu'on coupe la dent, on coupe plusieurs fois chacune des substances qui la composent: telles sont les dents molaires de VElephant." The teeth of the " Labyrinthodonts " would come under this definition more truly than those of the elephant, although they differ from them in having no enamel; for a molar of an elephant might be bisected, verti- cally and transversely, without cutting the tissues across more than once. pendent series of dentinal tubules. Each tooth, in fact, consists of a congeries of long and slender prismatic denticles of dentine, which are cemented together by their ossified capsules, the columnar denticles slightly de- creasing in diameter and occasionally bifur- cating as they approach the grinding surface of the tooth. A figure of a longitudinal section of the molar teeth is given in PI. 76, Jig. 10. of my " Odontography," and a magnified view of a similar section in PI. 77. ; jig. 555. gives a magnified view of a portion of the transverse Fig. 555.

The pectinated incisors of the flying Lemur of the Indian Islands (Galcopit/iecus) are ex- amples of teeth, the crowns of which are composed of denticles consisting of hard den- tine, with a covering of true enamel. The layer of cement over this is too thin to show its characteristic structure, and does not fill up the intervals of the denticles, which stand out as free processes from the base of the crown. Tubular prolongations of the pulp- cavity are continued up the centre of each denticle. Fig. 556. exhibits a longitudinal section, magnified, of this kind of compound tooth; d is the dentine; e the enamel; p the pulp- cavity. The originally detached summits of the crown of the human incisor are homo- logous with these columnar processes, or denticles of the incisor of the Galeopithecus. In the compound molars of the great Afri- can wart-hogs (Phacochcvrus) the columnar denticles are in three rows, and their inter- spaces are filled up by cement: each denticle consists of a slender column of hard dentine inclosed in a thick sheet of enamel, the whole being bound together by the cement; and theTEETH. 871 3 K 4 denticles, as in the Galeopithecus, blending long diameter of the tooth.

When a vertical and longitudinal section is made of one of these upper pharyngeal compound teeth, each denticle is seen to be composed, as in fig. 558., of a body of very hard and unvascular dentine d, with a thick sheath of enamel e, the denticles being united together by the cement c, and supported and further united together, and to the pharyngeal bone, by a basal mass of vascular osteo-dentine. Such are some of the prominent features of a field of observation which comparative anatomy opens out to our view ; — such the varied nature, and such the gradation of complexity of the dental tissues, which, up to December 1839*, continued, notwithstanding successive approximations to the truth, to be described in systematic works as a " pha- neros," or " a dead part or product exhaled from the surface of a formative bulb!" The truth may be slowly but is surely established, subject to the usual attempts to mask or detract from the merit of the discovery. By no systematic authors has the hypothesis of the formation of dentine by transudation or secretion been more frequently or more ex- plicitly enunciated than by the Cuviers. Baron Cuvier repeats, in both editions of his elaborate work — the " Ossemens Fossiles " — " C'est dans ce vide confevable que se de- poseront les matieres qui doivent former la dent, savoir: la substance vulgairement ap- pelee osscusc, qui sera transudee par des pro- ductions gelatineuses venant du fond de la ' capsule, et l'email qui sera depose par les cloisons membranenses," t.ii. p. 61., ed. 1812.; t. i. p. 33., ed. 1821. See, also, M. F. Cuvier, " Dents de Mammiferes,'' 8vo, 1825. " L'ivoire se depose par couches concentriques," p. xxvii. ; " L'email se depose dans un sens contraire a l'ivoire," ib. p. xxviii. And Baron Cuvier again, in the second edition of his "Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee," t. iv. 1836, p. 214 : "L'ivoire se depose par couches, par une sorte de transudation." In the first edition of this classical work, Cuvier had illustrated the peculiarity of the teeth of certain fishes, which are at first detached and afterwards united to the jaw-bone, by com- paring their growth to that of the epiphyses of the long bones: " Mais les dents qui ne tiennent qu'a la gencive seulement, comme celle des Squales, croissent a la maniere des epiphyses des os, c'estVa-dire que toute leur substance osseuse est d'abord tendre et po- reuse, et qu'elle se durcit uniformement, et finit par devenir entierement dure comme de l'ivoire," t. iii. 1805, p. 112. "Whether the great anatomist meant to imply that the * See the Fasciculus of M. de Blainville's great ■work, " Osteographie et Odontographie d'Animaux Vertebras," which he submitted to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France on the same day, December 16th, 1839, on which I communicated, on the occasion of my election as corresponding member of that body, my " Theory of the development of dentine by centripetal calcification and conversion of the cells of the pulp." osseous tissue of the epiphyses of bones was developed differently from osseous tissue in general, e. g. by the uniform and simultaneous hardening or calcification, obscurely referred to in the above quotation, may be questioned, for such is not the way in which the teeth of the shark are calcified. But this is certain, that the idea, whatever it might have been, had no influence on the fixed belief of the developement of the dental tissue by trans- udation expressed in their later and more elaborate works by Baron Cuvier and his ac- complished brother ; and, in point of fact, the passage which I have quoted is expunged from the second edition of the " Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee," 1835: the successive stages of calcification in the different teeth of the same vertical series in the jaw of the shark, having probably been noticed in the interim by Cuvier. The author of the article " Secretions " in the "Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Na- turelle," has, however, reproduced Cuvier's ob- scure comparison of certain fishes' teeth to the epiphyses of bone, as evidence of the need- lessness of any ulterior researches for the demonstration of the theory of dental de- velopement by conversion and calcification of the pulp. The passage from the third vol. of the old edition (1800) of the " Lecons d'Anat. Comp.," p. 112, is cited to show that it naturally conducts to the knowledge of such mode of developement of dentine : " En 1840 et 1841 (the ' Comptes Rendus del'Acad. des Sciences' give the true date) l'etude des dents de Squale par M. R. Owen, lui a de- montree leur accroissemcnt par intussuscep- tion, comme elle avait ete a G. Cuvier trente- cinq annees auparavant." How or why G. Cuvier came to abandon the theory so demon- strated, and how it happened that none of his contemporaries adopted it, M. Duvernoy does not explain. He does give a reason for the omission, in the second edition of the " Lecons d'Anat. Comp." of the passage which he affirms to contain the demonstration : " Malheureuse- ment, le copiste de cet ancien texte pour la 2de edition a omis ce passage, par oubli." It was natural to conclude that its obscurity and seeming contradiction to the theory of dental developement, formally propounded by Cuvier, as well as to the facts shown by nature in the sharks, had been the cause of its omission ; but even had the misfortune to which M. Duvernoy now attributes that omission (for in the copious list of addenda and corrigenda to the fifth, 1837, and final, 1846, volumes it is not noticed) not occurred, the coincidence of such passages as the fol- lowing would still have been inexplicable and irreconcilable with the deductions that M. Dumeril is now enabled to draw from the comparison of the shark's tooth with the epiphyses of long bones. " L'ivoire se depose par couches, par une sorte de transudation." Lecons d'Anat. Comparee, t. iv., 1836, p. 214. To which proposition Cuvier has himself added a note : " Je me suis assure recemnient, sur des germes de dents d'elephanf, que la substance osseuse de la dent se forme comme873 TEETH. Ics coquilles." And the editor (M. Duvernoy), in order to obviate any possibility of miscon- ception, has himself subjoined a note to that passage, as follows: " L'ivoire a ete aussi appelle substance osseuse, a cause de son analogie de composition chimique et de durete avec les os. Mais la nature inerte et inorganique de cette substance, mieux appreciee dans ces derniers temps, surtout par les travaux de M. Cuvier, ne permet plus de la designer, avec justesse, par cette seconde expression. Uu moins est-il necessaire de premunir le lecteur contre l'idee fausse qu'il pourrait en tirer, qu'elle serait organisee, qu'elle se develop- (>erait a la maniere des os."—Tom. cit. p. 201, (1836). In the same spirit in which M. Du- vernoy sees (in 1848) that a true idea, instead of a false one, may be drawn from casual expres- sions and similies loosely applied in the old Le- cons of 1800 and 1805 ; others have sought to depreciate the value of the establishment of the truth by citing the doubts, or tentative approxi- mations made by Purkinje and Schwann to my theory, interpreting such approximations by the light of the established truth. So far from finding such a resting-place for doubt in Cuvier's early simile, cited by M. Duvernoy in 1848, or in the interrogatories of Schwann, nothing short of the investigation of the whole of this vast subject, zootomically, develop- mentally, and microscopically, as narrated in my " Odontography," sufficed to settle my own doubts ; and nothing short of the evidence and illustrations given in that work appeared to me adequate to convert anatomists from the excretion-hypothesis to the intussuscep- tion theory. That the dentine is the ossified pulp is an older notion than that it is an inorganic secretion from such pulp. But an hypo- thesis, to be of any value in science, must be proved. .Almost every true theory has been indicated, with various degrees of approxi- mation, before its final establishment : but he has ever been held, in exact philosophy, to be the author of a theory, by whom it has been first rightly enunciated and satisfactorily established. When time has dissipated the mists of individual or national rivalries and jealousies, the name of the true discoverer is clearly seen by the inextinguishable light of true and impartial history : and to that period I look forward with calm and confident hope. I proceed now to briefly point out the leading characteristics of the teeth in the dif- ferent classes of the vertebrate animals. Dental System of Fishes. The teeth of fishes, whether we study them in regard to their number, form, substance, structure, situation, or mode of attachment, offer a greater and more striking series of varieties than do those of any other class of animals. As to number, they range from zero to countless quantities. The Lancelet, the Am- mocete, the Sturgeon, the Paddle-fish, and the whole order of Lophobranchii, are eden- tulous. The Myxinoids have a single pointed tooth on the roof of the mouth (Jig. 559., a), and two serrated dental plates (b) on the Fig. 559. Myxinc. (Midler.) tongue. The Tench (Jig. 514. Vol. III. p. 979. art. Pisces)* has a single grinding tooth on the occiput (<•), opposed to two denti- gerous pharyngeal jaws below (dd). In the Lepidosiren a single maxillary dental plate (Jig. 560., a) is opposed to a single mandibular Fig. 560. Lepidosh one (b), and there are two small denticles on the nasal bone (c). In the extinct Sharks with crushing teeth, called Ceratodus and Cte- nodus, the jaws were armed with four teeth, two above and two below.f In the Chimcerce, two mandibular teeth are opposed to four maxillary teeth.J From this low point the number in different fishes is progressively multiplied until, in the Pike, the Siluroids (Jig. 561.), and many other fishes, the mouth becomes crowded with countless teeth. With respect to form, 1 may first observe, that as organised beings withdraw themselves more and more, in their ascent in the scale of life, from the influence of the general polarising forces, so their parts progressively deviate from geometrical figures: it is only, therefore, in the lowest vertebrated class that we find teeth in the form of perfect cubes, and of prisms or plates with three sides (Myletes), four sides (Searus), five or six sides, Alylio- bates (Jig. 562.). The cone is the most com- mon form in fishes : such teeth may be slender, sharp-pointed, and so minute, numerous, and closely aggregated, as to resemble the plush or pile of velvet; these are called "villiform teeth" (dentes vilUformes, dents en velours^); all the teeth of the Perch are of this kind : * And Odontography, pi. 57.

" setiform" (denies setiformcs, dentes en brossc) : conical teeth, as close set and sharp pointed as the villiform teeth, but of larger size, are called " rasp-teeth " (dentes radu/iformcs, dents en rape or en cardes,fig. 561.) ; the Pike pre- sents such teeth on the back part of the vomer : the teeth of the Sheat-fish (Si/urus glanis) present all the gradations between the villi- form and raduliform types. Setiform teeth are common in the fishes thence called Chae- todonts* ; in the genus Citharina they bifur- cate at their free extremities ; in the genus Platax they end there in three diverging points (fig. 563.), and the cone here merges into the long and slender cylinder. Some- times the cone is compressed into a slender trenchant blade : and this may be pointed and recurved, as in the Mureena; or barbed, as in Trichiurus, and some other Scomberoids ; or it may be bent upon itself, like a tenterhook, as in the fishes thence called Goniodonts.* In the Bonito may be perceived a progressive thickening of the base of the conical teeth : and this being combined in other predatory Fis. 563.

Such dental plates (denies lamelMormes) may be found, not only circular, but elliptical, oval, semilunar, sigmoid, oblong, or even square, hexagonal, pentagonal, or tri- angular ; and the grinding surface may present various and beautiful kinds of sculpturing. The broadest and thinnest lamelliform teeth are those that form the complex grinding tubercle of the Diodon.* The front teeth of the Flounder and Sargus present the form of compressed plates, at least in the crown, and are true denies incisivi. Numerous wedge- shaped dental plates (denies cuneati) are set vertically in the upper pharyngeal bones of the Parrot-fish (Scants, fig. 565.). A thin Fig. 505. Superior pharyngeal bones and teeth (Scants). lamella, slightly curved like a finger-nail, is the singular form of tooth in an extinct genus of fishes, which I have thence called Petalodus. Sometimes the incisive form of tooth is notched in the middle of the cutting edge, as in Sargus unimaculatus. Sometimes the edge of the crown is trilobate (Aplodactylus, fig. 566.). Fig. 566. Front teeth o f Aplodactylus. Sometimes it is made qninquelobate by a double notch on each side of the large middle lobe (Buops). In the formidable Sea-pike t Odontography, pi. 38, fig. 2; and art. Pisces, Vol. III. p 980,^. 617. (Sphyrcena Barracuda) the crown of each tooth, large and small, is produced into a compressed and sharp point, and resembles a lancet. Sometimes the edges of such lancet- shaped teeth are finely serrated, as in Priodon, and the great Sharks of the genus Carcharias, the fossil teeth of which indicate a species (Carch. Megalodon) sixty or seventy feet in length. The lancetted form is exchanged for the stronger spear-shaped tooth in the Sharks of the genus Lamna ; and in the allied great ex- tinct OloduSj as in the small Porbeagle, simi- larly shaped, but stronger, piercing and cut- ting teeth were complicated by one or more accessory compressed cusps on each side their base, like the Malay crease. With respect to situation, the teeth, in Sharks and Rays, are limited to the bones (maxillary and mandibular), which form the anterior aperture of the mouth : in the Carp ami other Cyprinoids the teeth are confined to the bones (pharyngeal and basi-occipital) which circumscribe the posterior aperture of the mouth. The Wrasses (Labrus) and the Parrot-fishes (Scarus) have teeth on the pre-maxillary and pre-mandibular, as well as on the upper and lower pharyngeals ; both the anterior and posterior apertures of the mouth being thus provided with instruments for seizing, dividing, or comminuting the food, the grinders being situated at the pha- rynx. In most fishes teeth are developed also in the intermediate parts of the oral cavity, as on the palatines, the vomer, the hyoid bones, the branchial arches; and, though less commonly, on the pterygoids, the entopterygoids, the sphenoids, and even on the nasal bone (fig. 560, c). It is very rare to find teeth developed on the true superior maxillary bones ; but the Herring and Salmon tribes, some of the Ganoid Fishes, and the great Sudis, are examples of this approach to the higher Vertebrata. Among the anoma- lous positions of teeth may be cited, besides the occipital alveolus of the Carp *, the mar- ginal alveoli of the prolonged, depressed, well ossified rostrum of the Saw-fish, Pristis. In the Lampreys and in Hclostomus (an os- seous fish), most of the teeth are attached to the lips. Lastly, it is peculiar to the class Pisces, amongst Vertebrata, to offer examples of teeth developed in the median line of the mouth, as in the palate of the Myxines (Jig. 559, a.) ; or crossing the symphysis of the jaw, as in Notidanus, Scymnus, and jMyliobatcs. Nor is the mode less varied than the place of attachment. The teeth of Lopkius, Pee- cilia, Anableps, are always moveable. In most fishes they are anchylosed to the jaws by continuous ossification from the base of the dental pulp; the histological transition being more or less gradual from the structure of the tooth to that of the bone. Sometimes we find, not the base, but one side of the tooth anchylosed to the alveolar border of the jaw; and the teeth oppose each other by * Odontography, pi. 8; and art. Pisces, "Vol. III., p. 980, fig. 518.TEETH. 876 their sides instead of their summits (Scants*); in Pimelodus, however, where the teeth are thus attached, the crown is bent down in the upper teeth, and bent up in the lower ones, at right angles to the fang, so that they oppose each other by the normal surfaces. Certain teeth of recent and fossil cartilagi- nous fishes have their base divided into processes like fangs, but these serve for the attachment of ligaments, and are not set in bony sockets like the true fangs or roots of the teeth of the Mammalia. Some Sharks have two divaricating fangs ; some fossil teeth referred to my genus Petalodus by Agassiz, with the specific name " radicans" have the base divided into several fangs or processes, indicating a generic distinction. The base of anchylosed teeth is, at first, attached to the jaw-bone by ligament; and in the Cod- fish, Wolf-fish, and some other species, as calcification of the tooth progresses towards its base, the subjacent portion of the jaw- bone receives a stimulus, and developes a process corresponding in size and form with the base of the tooth : for some time a thin layer of ligamentous substance intervenes, but anchylosis usually takes place to a greater or less extent before the tooth is shed. Most of the teeth of the Lophius retain the primitive ligamentous connection; the ligaments f of the large internal or posterior teeth of the upper and lower jaws, radiate on the corre- sponding sides of the bone, the base of the tooth resting on a conformable alveolar pro- cess. The ligaments do not permit the tooth to be bent outwards beyond the vertical posi- tion, but yield to pressure in the contrary direc- tion, by which the point of the tooth may be directed towards the back of the mouth ; the instant, however, that the pressure is remitted, the tooth returns through the elasticity of the bent ligaments, as by the action of a spring, into its usual erect positions (Jig- 512, c.c. Vol. III. p. 978. art. Pisces) ; the deglutition of the prey of this voracious fish is thus facili- tated, and its escape prevented.% The broad and generally bifurcate bony base of the teeth of Sharks is attached by ligament to the semi- ossified crust of the cartilaginous jaws §; but they have no power of erecting or de- pressing the teeth at will. The small and closely crowded teeth of Rays are also con- nected by ligaments to the subjacent maxillary and mandibular membranes. The broad tes- selated teeth of the Myliobates have their attached surface longitudinally grooved to afford them better hold-fast, and the sides of the contiguous teeth are articulated together by serrated or finely undulating sutures, a structure unique in dental organisation.|| The teeth of the Sphyrcena are examples of the ordinary implantation in sockets, with the addition of a slight anchylosis of the base of the fully-formed tooth with the alveolar pa- * Odontography, pi. 49; and art.

Pisces, Vol. III., fig. 510, p. 976. || Odontography, p. 46. pi. 27 c. rietes ; and the compressed rostral teeth of the Saw-fish are deeply implanted in sockets. In the latter the hind margin of their base is grooved, and a corresponding ridge from the back part of the socket fits into the groove, and gives additional fixation to the tooth. Some implanted teeth in the present class have their hollow base further supported, like the claws of the feline tribe, upon a bony process aris- ing from the base of the socket ; the incisors of the Balistes, e.g., afford an example of this double or reciprocal gomphosis. In fact, the whole of this part of the organisation of fishes is replete with beautiful instances of design, and instructive illustrations of animal me- chanics. The vertical section of a pharyngeal jaw and teeth of the Wrasse (Labrus *) would afford the architect a model of a dome of unusual strength, and so supported as to re- lieve from pressure the floor of a vaulted chamber beneath. The base of the dome- shaped tooth is slightly contracted, and is implanted in a shallow circular cavity; the rounded margin of which is adapted to a cir- cular groove in the contracted part of the base; the margin of the tooth which imme- diately transmits the pressure of the bone, is strengthened by an inwardly projecting con- vex ridge. The masonry of this inner but- tress, and of the dome itself, is composed of hollow columns, every one of which is placed so as best to resist or transmit in the due direction the external pressure. The floor of the alveolus is thus relieved from the office of sustaining the tooth : it forms, in fact, the roof of a lower vault, in which the germ of a successional tooth is in course of develop- ment ; had the crushing tooth in use, rested, as in the Wolf-fish, by the whole of its base upon the alveolus, the supporting plate, gra- dually undermined by the growth of the new tooth, must have given way, and been forced upon the subjacent delicate and highly vas- cular and sensitive matrix of the half-formed tooth. But the superincumbent pressure is exclusively sustained by the border of the alveolus, whence it is transferred to the walls dividing the vaulted cavities containing the germs of the new teeth ; the roofs of these cavities yield to the absorbent process consequent on the growth of the new teeth without materially weakening the attachment of the old teeth, and without the new teeth being subjected to any pressure until their growth is sufficiently advanced to enable them to bear it with safety ; by this time the sus- taining borders of the old alveolus are under- mined, and the old worn-down tooth is shed. The singular and powerfully developed dental system of the Wolf-fish (Anarrhi- chas Lupus) has been a subject of interest to many anatomists. The general character and physiological relations of the teeth in this species had not escaped the attention of Hunter. In his paper on the Gillaroo trout, read before the Royal Society in 1774, he ob- serves that " the teeth of fishes which subsist * Fig.544; andart.Pisces, Vol. III., fig. 513, p. 978,877 TEETH. chiefly on animal matter must vary according as their food may be common salt fish, or shell-fish." " Such fish as live on the first kind have, like the carnivorous quadrupeds and birds, no apparatus for mastication, their teeth being intended merely for catching the food and fitting it to be swallowed. But the shells of the second kind of food render some de- gree of masticatory power necessary to fit it for its passage either into the stomach or through the intestines : and accordingly we find in certain fish a structure suited to the purpose. Thus the mouth of the Wolf-fish is almost paved with teeth, by means of which it can break shells to pieces, and fit them for the oesophagus of the fish, and so effectually disengage the food from them, that though it lives upon such hard food, the stomach does not differ from that of other fish." But in order to secure the capture of the shell-fish, the teeth of the Wolf-fish arc not all crushers ; some present the Ianiary type, with the apices more or less recurved and blunted by use, and consist of strong cones spread abroad, like grappling hooks, at the anterior part of the mouth.* The premaxillary teeth are all conical, and arranged in two rows; there are two, three, or four in the exterior row, at the mesial half of the bone, which are the largest ; and from six to eight smaller teeth are irregularly arranged behind. There are three large, strong, diverging laniaries at the anterior end of each premandibular bone, and immediately behind these an irregular number of shorter and smaller conical teeth, which gradually exchange this form for that of large obtuse tubercles ; these extend backwards, in a double alternate series, along a great part of the alveolar border of the bone, and are termi- nated by two or three smaller teeth in a single row, the last of which again presents the conical form. Each palatine bone supports a double row of teeth, the outer ones being conical and straight, and from four to six in number; the inner ones two, three, or four in number, and tuberculate. I have seen a spe- cimen where the inner row was wanting on one side. The lower surface of the vomer is covered by a double irregularly alternate series of the same kind of large tuberculate crushing teeth as those at the middle of the premandibular. All the teeth are anchylosed to more or less developed alveolar eminences, like the anterior teeth of the Lophius. The periphery of the expanded circular base of the large anterior grappling teeth is divided into processes indicative of the original ligamen- tous fasciculi at the base of the pulp by the ossification of which their anchylosis is ef- fected. When such anchylosed teeth and the sup- porting bone are divided by a vertical sec- tion, as in Jig. 2, pi. 66, of my " Odonto- graphy," there may be generally discerned a faint transverse line indicating the original separation between the tooth and the bone, * Odontography, pi. CO, Gl. and more clearly defining the dental from the osseous structure, than in the anchylosed teeth of other fishes. From the enormous develop- ment of the muscles of the jaws, and the strength of the shells of the whelks and other tcstacca which are cracked and crushed by the teeth, their fracture and displacement must obviously be no unfrequent occurrence ; and most speci- mens of the jaws of the Wolf-fish exhibit some of the teeth either separated at this line of imperfect anchylosis, or, more rarely, broken off above the base, or, still more rarely, de- tached by fracture of the supporting osseous alveolar process. With regard to the substance of the teeth of fishes, the modifications of dentine, called vaso-dentine and osteo-dentine *, predomi- nate much more than in the higher Verte- brata; and they thus more closely resemble the bones which support them. There is, however, great diversity in respect of sub- stance. The teeth of most of the Chneto- donts are flexible, elastic, and composed of a yellowish subtransparent albuminous tissue ; such, likewise, are the labial teeth of the He- lostome, the premaxillary and mandibular teeth of the Goniodonts, and of that percoid genus thence called Trickodon. In the Cy- clostomes the teeth consist of a denser albu- minous substance. The upper pharyngeal molar of the Carp consists of a peculiar brown and scmitransparent tissue, hardened by salts of lime and magnesia. The teeth of the Fly- ing-fish (E.voccetus), and Sucking-fish (Nc- mora), consist of osteo-dentine. In many fishes, e.g. the Aeanthurus, Spliyrccna, anil certain Sharks (Lamna, Jig. 545.), a base, or body of osteo-dentine is coated by a layer of true dentine, but of unusual hardness, like enamel: in Prionndon this hard tissue predo- minates. In the Labrus the pharyngeal crush- ing teeth consist wholly of hard or unvascular dentine (Jig. 544.). In most Pycnodonts and Cestracionts, and many other fishes, the body of the tooth consists of ordinary unvascular dentine, covered by a modification of that tissue which I have called " vitro-dentine" from its clear, polished, enamel-like character: but this is not enamel, nor the product of a dis- tinct organ from the dentinal pulp : it differs from ordinary dentine in the greater propor- tion of the mineral particles, their more mi- nute diffusion through the gelatinous basis, in the straighter course and more minute size of the calcigcrous tribes ; it results from the calcification of the external layer of the den- tinal pulp, and is the first part of the tooth which is formed. In Sargus and Batistes the body of the tooth consists of true dentine, and the crown is covered by a thick layer of a denser tissue, developed by a distinct organ, and differing from the " enamel" of higher animals only in the more complicated and or- ganised mode of deposition of the earthy salts. The ossification of the capsule of the complex matrix of these teeth covers the enamel with a thin coating of " cement." In the pharyngeal * Odontography, Introduction, p. lxxii.878 TEETH. teeth of the Scams a fourth substance is added by the ossification of the base of the pulp after its summit and periphery have been converted into hard dentine ; and the teeth {fig. 558.), thus composed of cement (e), enamel (e), dentine (d), and osteo-dentine, are the most complex in regard to their sub- stance that have yet been discovered in the animal kingdom. The tubes which convey the capillary ves- sels through the substance of the osteo- and vaso-dentine of the teeth of fishes* were early recognised, on account of their com- paratively large size ; as by Andre, e.g. in the teeth of Acanthurus, and by Cuvier and Von Born in the teeth of the Wolf-fish and other species. Leeuwenhoek had also detected the much finer tubes of the peripheral dentine of the teeth of the Haddock. These " den- tinal tubuli" are given off from the parietes of the vascular canals, and bend, divide, and subdivide rapidly in the hard basis-tissue of the interspaces of those canals in osteo-den- tine ; the dentinal tubuli alone are found in true dentine, and they have a straighter and more parallel course, usually at right angles to the outer surface of the dentine. Those conical teeth which, when fully formed, con- sist wholly or in great part of osteo-den- tine or vaso-dentine, always first appear with an apex of hard or true dentine. In some fishes the simple central basal pulp-cavity of such teeth, instead of breaking up into irregu- _ar or parallel canals, sends out a series of vertical plates from its periphery, which, when calcified, give a fluted character to the base of the tooth, e. g. in Lcpidosteus oxyurus. f Sometimes such radiating vertical basal plates of dentine are wavy in their course, and send off narrow processes from their sides; and, as a thin layer of the outer capsule interdigi- tates with the outstanding plates of the den- tinal pulp, and becomes co-calcified with them, a transverse section of such a tooth presents a series of interblended wavy or labyrinthic tracts of thick dentine radiating from the cen- tre, and of thin cement converging towards the centre of the tooth.\ An analogous but more * The vaso-dentine of Pristis and Myliobates is like that of the teeth of the Cape Anteater ( Orycte- ropus): the vaso-dentine of the Psammodonts re- sembles that which forms the base of the tooth of the Sloth and Megatherium: the vaso-dentine of Mammals differs from the osteo-dentine in the absence of the radiated " Purkinjian;" cells. f Wyman, American Journal of Natural Sciences, Oct. 1843. Cuvier has given an accurate view of the plaited structure of the base of the Wolf-fish's teeth in pi. 32, Jig. 7. of his Lecons d'Anatomie Compare'e, 1805; where it is described at the base of the osseous tubercle, which supports the true tooth. { This remarkable structure attains its highest complication and forms the largest proportion of the tooth in the gigantic extinct labyrinthodont Batra- chia, and from which, therefore, I have taken the illustrations of that complex modification of dental structure (Jig. 552 .). I had discovered in 1841 the more simple modification of this structure " at the base of the tooth in a few fishes " (Geol. Trans., 2d series, vol. vi., p. 507), but had not then seen so complex an example in that class as Dr. Wyman complicated structure obtains when the ra- diating, wavy, vertical plates of dentine dicho- tomise, and give off from their sides, through- out their course, numerous branch plates and processes, which are traversed by medullary sinuses and canals with their peripheral ter- minations dilated, and becoming the centres of lobes or columns of hard dentine. The transverse section of such teeth gives the ap- pearance of bl anches of a tree, with leaf-stalks and leaves, radiating from the central pulp- cavity to the circumference of the tooth ; and I have called the fossil fish in which this structure was first detected, Dendrodus. Thus, with reference to the main and funda- mental tissue of tooth, we find not fewer than six leading modifications in fishes; — hard or true dentine {Sparoids, Labroids, Lophius, Ba- tistes, Pi/ciwdonts, Prionodon, Sphyrcena, Mega- tich'hys, Rhizodus, Diodon, Scarus) ; osteo- dentine (Cesfracion, Acrodus, Lepidosiren, Ctenodus, Hybodus, Percoids, Sciceuoids, Cot- toids, Gobioids, and many others); vaso-den- tine (Psammodiis, Chimceroids, Pristis, Mylio- bates) ; plici-dentine (Lophius, Holoptychius, Lcpidosteus oxyurus, at the base of the teeth) ; labyrintho-dentine (Lepidosteus platyrhinus, Bothriolepis); and dendro-dentine (Dendro- dus') ; besides the compound teeth of the Scarus and Diodon. One structural modification may prevail in some teeth, another in other teeth of the same fish ; and two or more modifications may be present in the same tooth, arising from changes in the process of calcification and a persis- tency of portions or processes of the primitive vascular pulp or matrix of the dentine. The dense covering of the beak-like jaws of the Parrot-fishes (Scari), consists of a stratum of prismatic denticles, standing al- most vertically to the external surface of the jaw-bone. An account of the structure and development of this peculiar armature of the jaws is abridged from my " Odontography " (pp. 112—416.), in the article Pisces ( Vol. 111, p. 979.). It is peculiarly adapted to the ha- bits and exigencies of a tribe of fishes which browse upon the lithoph}tcs that clothe, as with a richly tinted carpet, the bottom of the sea, just as the Ruminant quadrupeds crop the herbage of the dry land. The irritable bodies of the gelatinous polypes which constitute the food of these fishes retract, when touched, into their star- shaped stony shells, and the Scari conse- quently require a dental apparatus strong enough to break oft' or scoop out these cal- careous recesses. The jaws are, therefore, prominent, short, and stout, as shown in fig. 515. p. 979. Vol. HI.; ami the exposed portions of the premaxilliaries and premandibulars are encased by the complicated dental covering represented in figs. 515 and 516. Vol. III. The polypes and their cells are reduced to a pulp by the action of the pharyngeal jaws and M. Agassiz (Recherches sur les Poissons Fos- siles, " Sauroides," 1843) subsequently described and figured, in teeth of the genus Lepidosteus.879 TEETH. and teeth, that close the posterior aperture of the mouth. The superior dentigerous pharyngeals (figs. 5.58. and 565.) present the Ibrm of an elon- gated, vertical, inequilateral, triangular plate ; the upper and posterior margin is sharp and concave; the upper and anterior margin forms a thickened articular surface, convex from side to side, and playing in a corresponding groove or concavity upon the base of the skull ; the inferior boundary of the triangle is the longest, and also the broadest; it is convex in the antero-posterior direction, and flat from side to side. It is on this surface that the teeth are implanted, and in most species they form two rows ; the outer one consisting of very small, the inner one of large dental plates, which are set nearly transversely across the lower surface of the pharyngeal bone, and are in close apposition, one behind the other : their internal angles are produced beyond the margin of the bone, and interlock with those of the adjoining bone when the pharyngeals are in their natural position ; the smaller denticles of the outer row are set in the ex- ternal interspaces of those of the inner row. The single inferior pharyngeal bone con- sists principally of an oblong dentigerous plate, of the form represented in fig. 3, pi. 51, of my "Odontography;" its breadth somewhat exceeds that of the conjoined dentigerous surface of the pharyngeals above, and it is excavated to correspond with their convexity. This dentigerous plate is prin- cipally supported by a strong, slightly curved, transverse, osseous bar, the extremities of which expand into thick obtuse processes for the implantation of the triturating muscles. A longitudinal crest is continued downwards and forwards from the middle line of the inferior pharyngeal plate, anterior to the transverse bar, to which the protractor mus- cles are attached. A longitudinal row of small oval teeth alternating with the large lamelliform teeth, like those of the superior pharyngeals, bounds the dentigerous plate on each side; the inter- mediate space is occupied exclusively by the larger lamelliform or wedge-shaped teeth, set vertically in the bone, and arranged trans- versely in alternate and pretty close set series. The dental plates are developed in wide and deep cavities in the substance of the posterior part of the lower, and of the an- terior part of the upper pharyngeal bones. Each denticle is developed in its proper cap- sule, which contains an enamel-forming pulp and a dentinal pulp, in close cohesion with each other and with the thin external capsule. The teeth exhibit progressive stages of form- ation as they approach the posterior part of the upper and the anterior part of the lower pharyngeal bones : as their formation advances to completion they become soldered together by ossification of their respective capsules into one compound tooth, which soon be- comes anchylosed by ossification of the den- tinal pidp to the pharyngeal hone itself. The dentine of the pharyngeal teeth of the Scarus consists of calcigerous tubes and a clear intermediate substance. The calcigerous tubes average a diameter of ^o-.tjott °' an i'1L'h, and are separated by interspaces equal to twice their own diameter. The course of these tubes is shown in fig. 558, d., in which they are exposed by a vertical section through the middle of two of the superior denticles. They all, on leaving the pulp-cavity, form a curve with the convexity turned towards the base of the tooth, and then bend slightly in the opposite direction; the sigmoid curve being most marked in the calcigerous tubes at the base of the denticles, whilst those to- wards the apex become longer and straighter. Besides the primary curvatures exemplified in the figure, each calcigerous tube is minutely undulated ; it dichotomises three or four times near its termination, sends off many fine lateral branches into the clear uniting substance, and finally terminates in a series of minute cells and inosculating loops at the line of junction with the enamel. This substance (fig. 558, <?.) is as thick as the dentine, and consists of a similar combination of minute tubes and a clear connecting sub- stance. The tubes may be described as com- mencing from the pheripheral surface of the tooth to which they stand at right angles, and, having proceeded parallel to each other halfway towards the dentine, they then begin to divide and subdivide, the branches crossing each other obliquely, and finally terminating in the cellular boundary between the enamel and dentine. The teeth which present this complex structure are successively developed at one extremity of the bone, in proportion as they are worn away at the other ; not, however, as Cuvier describes, from behind forwards, in both upper and lower pharyngeal bones, but in opposite directions in the opposite bones, the course of succession being from before backwards in the upper, and from behind forwards in the lower pharyngeal bones. In the progress of the attrition to which they are subjected, the thin coat of cement result- ing from the ossification of the capsule is first removed from the apex of the tooth, then the enamel constituting that apex, next the den- tine, and, finally, the coarse central cellular bone, supporting the hollow wedge-shaped tooth ; and thus is produced a triturating surface of four different substances of different degrees of density. The enamel, being the densest element, appears in the form of ellip- tical transverse ridges, inclosing the dentine and central bone ; and external to the enamel is the cement which binds together the dif- ferent denticles. There is a close analogy between the dental mass of the Scarus and the complicated grinders of the elephant, both in form, struc- ture, and in the reproduction of the compo- nent denticles in horizontal succession. But in the fish, the complexity of the triturating surface is greater than in the Mammal, since, from the mode in which the wedge-shaped denticles of the Scarus are implanted upon,880 TEETH. and anchylosed to, the processes of the sup- porting bone, this likewise enters into the formation of the masticatory surface when the tooth is worn down to a certain point. The proof of the efficacy of the complex masticatory apparatus above described is afforded by the contents of the alimentary canal of the Scari. Mr. Charles Darwin, the accomplished naturalist and geologist, who accompanied Captain Fitzroy, R. N., in the circumnavigator}' voyage of the " Beagle," dissected several Parrot-fishes soon after they were caught, and found the intestines laden with nearly pure chalk, such being the nature of their excrements ; whence he ranks these fishes among the geological agents to which is assigned the office of converting the skeletons of the Lithophytes into chalk. Development.—As might have been antici- pated from the discovery of the varied and pre- dominating vascular organisation in the teeth of fishes, and the passage from non-vascular dentine to vascular dentine in the same tooth, the true law of the development of dentine "by centripetal metamorphosis and calcifica- tion of the cells of the pulp," was first defi- nitely enunciated and illustrated from observ- ations made on the development of the teeth of fishes.* It is interesting to observe in this class the process arrested at each of the well-marked stages through which the development of a mammalian tooth passes. In all fishes the first step is the simple production of a soft vascular papilla from the free surface of the buccal membrane : in Sharks and Kays these papilla? do not proceed to sink into the sub- stance of the gum, but are covered by caps of an opposite free fold of the buccal membrane ; these caps do not contract any organic con- nection with the papiliiform matrix, but, as this is converted into dental tissue, the tooth is gradually withdrawn from the extraneous protecting cap, to take its place and assume the erect position on the margin of the jaw (Jig. 510, b, a, art. Pisces, Vol. III. p. 976.). Here, therefore, is represented the first and transitory " papillary " stage of dental develop- ment in Mammals ; and the simple crcscentic cartilaginous maxillary plate, with the open groove behind containing the germinal papillae of the teeth, offers in the Shark a magnified representation of the earliest condition of the jaws and teeth in the human embryo. In many fishes, e. g. Lojihius, Esox, the dental papillae become buried in the membrane from which they rise, and the surface to which their basis is attached becomes the bottom of a closed sac : but this sac does not become inclosed in the substance of the jaw ; so that teeth at different stages of growth are brought away with the thick and soft gum, when it is stripped from the jaw-bone. The final fix- ation of teeth, so formed, is effected by the * In my Hunterian Lectures, delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons, May, 1839. See also, Compte Rendu de PAcademie des Sciences, Dec. 1839, p. 784.; and Odontography, Introduction, and part i. passim. development of ligamentous fibres in the sub- mucous tissue between the jaw and the base of the tooth, which fibres become the medium of connection between those parts, either as elastic ligaments, or by continuous ossifi- cation. Here, therefore, is represented the "follicular" stage of the development of a mammalian tooth ; but the " eruptive " stage takes place without previous inclosure of the follicle and matrix in the substance of the jaw-bone. In Balistes, Scants, Sphyrcena, the Sparoids, and many other fishes, the formation of the teeth presents all the usual stages which have been observed to succeed each other in the dentition of the higher Vcrtebrala: the papilla sinks into a follicle, becomes surrounded by a capsule, and is then included within a closed alveolus of the growing jaw (fig- 516. c, Vol. HI. p. 979. art. Pisces), where the de- velopement of the tooth takes place and is followed by the usual eruptive stages. A distinct enamel-pulp is developed from the inner surface of the capsule in Balistes, Scams, Sargus, and Chrysophrys, The most formidable dentition exhibited in the order of osseous fishes, is that which cha- racterises the Sphyrcena, and some extinct fishes allied to this predatory genus. In the great Barracuda of the southern shores of the United States (Sphyrcena Barracuda, Cuv.), the lower jaw contains a single row of large, compressed, conical, sharp-pointed, and sharp- edged teeth, resembling the blades of lancets, but stronger at the base. The two anterior of these teeth are twice as long as the rest, but the posterior and serial teeth gradually increase in size towards the back part of the jaw ; there are about twenty-four of these piercing and cutting teeth in each preman- dibular bone. They are opposed to a double row of similar teeth in the upper jaw, and fit into the interspace of these two rows when the mouth is closed. The outermost row is situated on the intermaxillary, the innermost on the palatine bones ; there are no teeth on the vomer or superior maxillary bones. The two anterior teeth in each premaxillary bone equal the opposite pair in the lower jaw in size: the posterior teeth are serial, numerous, and of small size ; the second of the two an- terior large premaxillary teeth is placed on the inner side of the commencement of the row of small teeth, and is a little inclined backwards. The retaining power of all the large anterior teeth is increased by a slight posterior projection, similar to the barb of a fish-hook, but smaller. The palatine bones contain each nine or ten lancet-shaped teeth, somewhat larger than the posterior ones of the lower jaw. All these teeth afford good examples of the mode of attachment by im- plantation in sockets, which has been denied to exist in fishes.* The loss or injury to which these destruc- tive weapons are liable in the conflict which the Sphyrcena wages with its living and * Cuvier, Ilistoire Katurcllc des Poissons, torn. i. p 492.TEETH. 881 struggling prey, is repaired by an uninter- rupted succession of new pulps and teeth. The existence of these is indicated by the foramina, which are situated immediately posterior to, or on the inner margin of, the sockets of the teeth in place ; these foramina lead to alveoli of reserve, in which the crowns of the new teeth in different stages of de- velopment are loosely embedded. It is in this position of the germs of the teeth that the Sphyraenoid fishes, both recent and fossil, mainly differ, as to their dental characters, from the rest of the Scombcroid family, and proportionally approach the Sauroid type. The base or fang of the fully-developed tooth of the Sphyrcena is anchylosed to the parietes of the socket in which it is inserted. The pressure of the crown of the new tooth ex- cites absorption of the inner side of the base of the old, which thus finally loses the requi- site strength of attachment ; and its loss is followed by the absorption of the old socket, as in the higher animals. It is interesting to observe that the alter- nate teeth are, in general, contemporaneously shed ; so that the maxillary armour is always preserved in an effective state. The relative position of the new teeth to their predecessors, and their inflnence upon them, resembles, in the Sphyrcena, some of the phenomena which will be described in the dentition of the cro- codilian reptiles. To the crocodiles the pre- sent voracious fish also approximates in the alveolar lodgment of the teeth ; but it mani- fests its ichthyic character in the anchylosis of the fully-developed teeth to their sockets, and still more strikingly in the intimate struc- ture of the teeth. In all fishes the teeth are shed and re- newed, not once only, as in Mammals, but frequently, during the whole course of their lives. The maxillary dental plates of Lepi- dosiren, the cylindrical dental masses of the Chimaeroid and Edaphodont fishes, and the rostral teeth of Pristis (if these modified dermal spines may be so called) are, perhaps, the sole examples of "permanent teeth" to be met with in the whole class. When the teeth are developed in alveolar cavities, they are usually succeeded by others in the vertical direction, as in the pharyngeal bones of the Labroids (fig. 513., art. Piscks, Vol. IK. p. 978.) ; but sometimes they follow one after the other, side by side, as in the Scaroids (Pisces, fig. 516. c, p. 979.). The successional teeth owe the origin of their matrix to the budding out from the capsule of their predecessors of a caecal process, in which the papillary rudiment of the dentinal pulp is developed according to the laws explained in the Introduction to my " Odontography," and the article Tooth. But, in the great majority of fishes, the germs of the new teeth are developed, like those of the old, from the free surface of the buccal membrane through- out the entire period of succession ; a cir- cumstance peculiar to the present class. The Angler, the Pike, and most of our common fishes, illustrate this mode of dental repro- VOL. IV. duction ; it is very conspicuous in the carti- laginous fishes, in which the whole phalanx of their numerous teeth is ever marching slowly forwards in rotatory progress over the alveolar border of the jaw, the teeth being successively cast off as they reach the outer margin, and new teeth rising from the mucous membrane behind the rear rank of the pha- lanx. This endless succession and decadence of the teeth, together with the vast numbers in which they often coexist in the same fish, illustrate the law of Vegetative or Irrelative Repetition, as it manifests itself on the first introduction of new organs in the animal kingdom, under which light we must view the above-described organised and calcified preparatory instruments of digestion in the lowest class of the vertebrate series. At the extreme limit of the class of fishes, and connecting that class with the reptiles, stands the very remarkable genus, the dental system of which is figured in cut 560. This consists of two small, slender, conical, sharp- pointed, and slightly recurved teeth, which project downwards from the nasal bone (t), and of strong trenchant dental plates anchy- losed with the alveolar border of the upper (a) and lower (b) jaws, in each of which the plate is divided at the middle, or symphysial line, so as to form two distinct lateral teeth. The office of the two laniariforin teeth is to pierce and retain the nutritive substance or prey which is afterwards divided and com- minuted by the strong maxillary dental plates. The upper pair of these plates is supported by the anterior part of a strong arch of bone, which combines the characters of the su- perior maxillary, palatine, and pterygoid bones; the superior maxillary is represented by the median and anterior bar, passing- in front of the dental plate of the lower jaw when the mouth is shut, terminating on each side in a process which projects outwards and back- wards, as in fig. 560 , a., on each side of the an- terior part of the arch ; the palatine portion constitutes the median part of the roof of the mouth behind the foregoing ; the pterygoid portion is indicated by its fulfilling the usual function of an abutment extended between the palatine portion of the upper jaw and the ar- ticular pedicle of the lower jaw; the upper dental plates are confined to the first two parts of the arch (maxillary and palatine), and do not extend upon the pterygoid portion ; the lower dental plates (b) are anchylosed to the premandibular bone. Viewing the upper pair of plates as a single tooth, it may be described as indented at its outer surface by five vertical angular notches, penetrating in- wards through half the breadth of the sup- porting bone, and dividing the plate into six angular processes, which, from the direction and varying form and breadth of the entering notches, radiate from the posterior part of the median line or division of the tooth. The inferior dental plate is similarly notched on itsjouter side, but the proportions of the an- gular indentations are such, that they receive 3 L882 TEETH. all the processes of the upper dental plate when the mouth is shut, whilst only the four anterior processes are reciprocally received into the notches of the upper dental plate, this, with the supporting arch, being anterior to the lower plate, — a position which is deci- sive in favour of its maxillary character, and against its homology with the vomer. The dental plate consists, as in the Cod and Sphyrcena, of a central mass of coarse osseous substance, traversed by large and nearly parallel medullary canals, and an ex- ternal sheath of very hard " vitro-dentine." The medullary canals are continued from a coarse reticulation of similar but wider canals in the substance of the supporting bone, and advance forwards, nearly parallel with each other and with the plane of the upper surface of the tooth ; they anastomose together by short, curved, transverse canals, which inter- cept spaces increasing in length as the canals recede from the osseous basis. The canals themselves diminish in size in the same ratio; and when they have arrived near the dense outer layer, their divisions and inosculations become again more frequent, the peripheral loops forming a well-marked line of demarca- tion between the coarse-tubed and the fine- tubed dentine. The interspaces of the medullary canals are occupied by a clear sub- stance, and by moss-like reticulations of fine dentinal tubes, which appear to be more sparing in number than in the teeth of the Sphyrcena or Shark. The dentinal tubes of the vitro-dentine run nearly parallel to each other, and vertically to the external surface of the dental plate through about two-thirds of the thickness of that tissue ; they then bend and cross each other in a manner very similar to those of the vitro-dentine in the teeth of the Lepidotus, Phyllodus, ike* In the process of attrition this external dense substance is worn away from the upper surface of the dental processes in the lower jaw, exposing the softer vaso-dentinal sub- stance of the tooth ; in this state the den- tal plate offers an analogy to the incisors of the Rodents, a posterior softer substance being sheathed by an anterior denser layer; and an external sharp edge is similarly kept up by the unequal wearing away of the two substances. The progressive waste at the upper surface of the dental plate would appear to be met by a corresponding additon of new material to its lower part. In the structure here presented we have a condition of the dentine which has hitherto been met with only in the class of fishes. The test of the affinities of the present paradoxical genus, afforded by the micro- scopic examination of the teeth, gives addi- tional confirmation to the view to which I have been led, from arguments drawn from the rest of its organisation, that the Lepido- siren is in every essential point a member of the class of fishes.-j- * See Odontography, pp. 70. 1G6, pi. 59, fig. 4. \ Linnean Transactions, vol. xviii. 1839. p. 350. That the large size, or elliptical form of its blood- Dentnl System of Reptiles. If we compare the dental system of the foregoing Batrachoid fish with that in the true Batraehia, it is only to the larval state of the Anourans that an analogy can be found; the tadpole of the frog having its maxilla and mandibula each sheathed with a single and continuous horny dental trenchant covering. Were this sheath actually dentinal in tissue and united to the jaw-bone, the re- semblance to the Lcpidosiren would be closer ; but in point of fact the analogy is very remote; the horny beak of the tadpole is never calcified or anchylosed, but is shed during the progress of the metamorphosis.* The Siren alone, among the larval-like pe- rennibranchiate reptiles, retains the sheath upon the extremity of the upper and lower jaws ; it consists of a firm albuminous tissue, and becomes harder than horn. But these trenchant mandible?, which play upon one another like the blades of a pair of curved scissors, are associated with numerous small but distinct true teeth, which are grouped together to form a rasp-like surface on each half of the divided vomer, and which beset the alveolar border of the splenial element of the mandible below. In the class Reptilia, the whole order of Chelonia is edentulous, as well as the whole family of Toads (JBufonidae) in the order Balrachia; certain extinct genera of Sau- rians were likewise edentulous, e.g. the re- markable " Rlu/nchosaurus" of the new red sandstone of Shropshire, and some of the extinct Saurians of South Africa. In the tortoises and turtles the jaws are covered by a sheath of horn, which in some species is of considerable thickness and very dense ; its working surface is trenchant in the carnivorous species, but variously sculptured, and adapted for both cutting and bruising in the vegetable feeders ; it may be said that the transitory condition of the mandibles of the Batrachian larvae is here persistent. The development of the continuous horny maxillary sheath commences, as in the parrot tribe, from a series of distinct papillae, which sink into alveolar cavities, regularly arranged (in Trionyx) along the margins of the upper and lower jaw-bones: these alveoli are in- dicated by the persistence of vascular canals long after the originally separate tooth-like cones have become confluent, and the horny sheath completed. The teeth of the dentigerous Saurian, discs should outweigh the cumulative evidence esta- blishing the piscine nature of the Lepidosiren could only be surmised by those who are ignorant of the variation in size and shape which the blood-discs present in the class of fishes, and the consequent unimportance of those particles as a character of the class. As well might the Petromyzon be deemed a mammal because its blood-discs are circular and comparatively small, as the Lcpidosiren be held to be a Batrachian because its blood-discs are elliptical and comparatively large. * The large dental plates of Lepidosiren have their nearest homologues in those of the extinct iish called Ceratodus (Odontography, pi. 22, fig. 2.).TEETH. 883 Ophidian, and Batracliian reptiles, are, for the most part, simple and adapteil for seizing and holding, but not for dividing or masticating their food. The Siren alone combines true teeth with a horny maxillary trenchant sheath, like that of the Chelonian reptiles. With respect to number, in no existing rep- tile are the teeth reduced so low as in certain mammals and fishes ; nor, on the other hand, are they ever so multiplied as in many of the latter class. The extinct Dicynodont reptiles of South Africa had but two teeth, which were long tusks implanted in the upper jaw.* Some species of Amphhbcena (A. alba), with fifteen teeth in the upper jaw and four- teen in the lower jaw, and certain Monitors (Varanus), with sixteen teeth in the upper and fourteen in the lower jaw, afford examples of the smallest number of teeth amongst existing reptiles ; and certain Batracbians, with teeth "en cardes " at the roof of the mouth, or which have upwards of eighty teeth in each lateral maxillary series, present the largest number. It is rarely that the number of the teeth is fixed and determinate in any reptile so as to be characteristic of the species, and still more rarely have the individual teeth such characters as to be determined homo- logically from one species to another. With respect to situation, the teeth may be present on the jaws only, i.e. the maxillary, pre- maxillary, and mandibular bones, as in the croco- diles and many lizards : or upon the jaws and roof of the mouth ; and here either upon the pterygoid bones, as in the Iguana and Mosa- saur, or upon both palatine and pterygoid bones, as in most serpents, or upon the vomer, as in most Batrachians, or upon both vomerine and pterygoid bones, as in the Axo- lote; or upon the vomerine and sphenoid bones, as in the Salamandraglutinosa, Maclure. With respect to the marginal or jaw teeth, these may be absent in the intermaxillary bones, as in many serpents; or they may be present in the upper and not in the lower jaw, as in most frogs ; or in both upper and lower jaws, as in the tailed Batrachians ; and among these they may be supported, upon the lower jaw, by the premandibular or den- tary piece, as in the Salamanders, Menopome, Amphiume, Proteus ; or upon the splenial piece, as in the Siren ; or upon both splenial and premandibular bones, as in the Axolotl. The palatine and pterygoid teeth may, in the Batrachians, be arranged in several rows, like the " dents en cardes " of fishes. The sphe- noid and splenial teeth are always so ar- ranged in the few species that possess them. The intermaxillary, maxillary, and preman- dibular teeth are uniserial, or in one row, with the exception of the Cascilia and the extinct Labyrinthodonts, which have a double row of teeth at the anterior part of the lower jaw. The teeth of reptiles, with few exceptions, present a simple conical form, with the crown more or less curved, and the apex more or * Transactions of the Geological Society, 2d series, vol. vii., 1845, p. 50. less acute. The cone varies in length and thickness ; its transverse section is sometimes circular, but more commonly elliptical or oval, and this modification of the cone may be traced through every gradation, from the thick, round, canine-like tooth of the croco- dile, to the sabre-shaped fang of the Varanus, the Megalosaur, and the Cladeiodon.* Some- times, as in the fully formed teeth of the Megalosaur, one of the margins of the com- pressed crown of the tooth is trenchant, sometimes both are so ; and these may be simply sharp-edged, as in the Varanus of Timor, or finely serrated, as in the great Va- ranus, the Cladeiodon, and the Megalosaur.-j- The outer surface of the crown of the tooth is usually smooth ; it may be polished, as in the Leiodon, or impressed with fine lines, as in the Labyrinthodon {fig. 551.), or raised into many narrow ridges, as in the Pleiosaur and Poiyptychodon, or broken by a few broad ridges, as in the Iguanodon { 'fig. 571.), or grooved by a single longitudinal furrow, as in some serpents (fig.,5(59, A).t The cone is longest and its summit sharpest in the serpents : from these may be traced, chiefly in the lizard tribe, a progressive short- ening, expansion of the base, and blunting of the apex of the tooth, until the cone is reduced to a hemispherical tubercle, or plate, as in the Thorictes and Cyclodus (fig. 570.). In the Pleiosaur the dental cone is three- sided, with one of the angles rounded off. The posterior subcompressed teeth of the alligator (Jig. 573.) present anew modification of fornix here they terminate in a mammillate summit, supported by a slightly constricted neck. In the tooth of the Hylceosaur the expanded summit is flattened, bent, and spear- shaped, with the edges blunted. But the expansion of the crown is greatest in the sub- compressed teeth of the extinct Cardiodon and the existing Iguanas, the teeth of which are farther complicated by having the margins notched. The great Iguanodon had the crown of the tooth expanded both in length and breadth, and combining marginal dentations with longitudinal ridges : this tooth (fig. 571.) presents the most complicated external form as yet discovered in the class of reptiles. In no reptiles does the base of the tooth ever branch into fangs. Attachment. — As a general rule, the teeth of reptiles are anchylosed to the bone which supports them. When they continue distinct, they may be lodged either in a continuous groove, as in the Ichthyosauri, or in separate sockets, as in the Plesiosaur and Crocodilians (fig. 573.). The base of the tooth is anchy- losed to the walls of a moderately deep socket in the extinct Megalosaur and Theocodon. In the Labyrinthodonts and Caecilia;, among the Bratrachians ; in most Ophidians ; and in the Geckos, Agamians, and Varanians, among the Saurians, the base of the tooth is * Odontography, pi. 62 A, fig. 4. f lb. fit/. 6c. % lb. pi. 65; vol.iv.,^6-. 200, 210. § lb. pi. 13, fig. 9. 3l 2TEETH. 884 imbedded in a shallow socket, and is confluent therewith. In the Scincoidians, the Safeguards {Tejus), in most Iguanians, in the Chameleons and most other Lacertian reptiles, the tooth is anchylosed by an oblique surface extending from the base more or less upon the outer side of the crown to an external alveolar plate of bone*, the inner alveolar plate not being developed. In the frogs the teeth are simi- larly but less firmly attached to an external parapet of bone. The lizards which have their teeth thus attached to the side of the jaw are termed Pleurodonts. In a few Igua- nians, as the Istiures, the teeth appear to be soldered to the margins of the jaws, these have been termed " Acrodonts." In some large extinct Lacertians, e. g. the Mosasaur and Leiodon, the tooth is fixed upon a raised conical process of bone, as shown in my " Odontography," Plate 68. fig. 1., and Plate 72. fig. 2. These modifications of the attachment of the teeth of reptiles are closely adapted to the destined application of those instruments, and relate to the habits and food of the species ; we may likewise perceive that they offer a close analogy to some of the transitory' con- ditions of the human teeth. There is a period, for example-f-, when the primitive dental papilla; are not defended by either an outer or an inner alveolar process, any more than their calcified homologues which are confluent with the margin of the jaw in the Rhynchocephalus.'\. There is another stage§, in which the groove containing the den- tal germs is defended by a single external cartilaginous alveolar ridge ; this condition is permanently typified in the Cyclodus (fig. 570.) and most existing lizards. Next there is developed in the human embryo an internal alveolar plate, and the sacs and pulps of the teeth sink into a deep but continuous groove, in which traces of transverse partitions soon make their appearance ; in the ancient Ichthy- osaur the relation of the jaws to the teeth never advanced bejond this stage. Finally, the dental groove is divided by complete partitions ||, and a separate socket is formed for each tooth ; and this stage of developement is attained in the highest or- ganised reptiles, e.g. the crocodiles (fig. 573.). Substance. — This may be four-fold, and a single tooth may be composed of dentine, cement, enamel, and bone; but the dentine and cement are present in the teeth of all reptiles. In the Batrachians and Ophidians a thin layer of cement invests the central body of dentine, and, as usual, follows any in- flections or sinuosities that may characterise * Odontography, pi. G7. f At the sixth week of gestation : see Prof. Good- sir, " On the Development of the Human Teeth," Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, No. 138. % See Geological Transactions, 2d series, vol. vii. pt. 2, pi. G,fgs. 5 & G, p. 83. § At the seventh or eighth -week: Ibid. || At the sixth month: Ibid. the dentine. Besides the outer coat of cement, which is thickest at the base of the teeth, a generally thin coat of enamel defends the crown of the tooth in most Saurians, and the last remains of the pulp are not unfrequently converted into a coarse bone, both in the teeth which are anchylosed to the jaw, and in some teeth, as those of the Ichthyosaur, which remain free. The only modification of the dentine, which could at all entitle it to be regarded in the light of a new or distinct substance, is that which is peculiar in the present class to the teeth of the Iguanodon, and which will be described in the following section. Structure. — The varieties of dental structure are few in the reptiles as compared with either fishes or mammals, and its most com- plicated condition arises from interblending of the dentinal and other substances rather than from modifications of the tissues themselves. In the teeth of most reptiles the intimate structure of the dentine corresponds with that which has been described as the type of the tissue, e.g. the hard or unvascular dentine, and which is the prevailing modification in Mammalia, viz., the radiation of a system of minute plasmatic tubes from a single pulp- cavity, at right angles to the external surface of the tooth. The most essential modification of this structure is the intermingling of cylin- drical processes of the pulp-cavity in the form of medullary canals, with the finer tubular structure.* Another modification is that in which the dentine maintains its normal struc- ture, but is folded inwardly upon itself, so as to produce a deep longitudinal indentation on one side of the tooth ; it is the expansion of the bottom of such a longitudinal deep fold that forms the central canal of the venom- fang of the serpent; but a glance at 7%. 568. will show that, notwithstanding the singularly modified disposition of the dentine (b), its structure remains unaltered ; and although the pulp-cavity (p) is reduced to the form of a crescentic fissure, the dentinal tubes continue to radiate from it according to the usual law. By a similar inflection of many vertical longi- tudinal folds of the external cement and ex- ternal surface of the tooth at regular intervals around the entire circumference of the tooth, and by a corresponding extension of radiated processes of the pulp-cavity and dentine into the interspaces of such inflected and con- verging folds, a modification of dental struc- ture is established in certain extinct reptiles, which, by the various sinuosities of the inter- blended folds of cement and processes of dentine, with the partial dilatations of the radiated pulp-cavity, produces the compli- cated structure which is described at p. 868. and figured in cut 552. But this compli- cation is nevertheless referable to a modi- fication of form or arrangement of the dental tissues, rather than of the structure of the tissues themselves: the calcigerous tubes in each sinuous lobe of dentine, in the most * Odontography, pi. 71, Iguanodon.885 TEETH. complex tooth of the Labyrinthodon, exhibit the same general disposition and course as in the fang of the serpent and in the still more simple tooth of the Saurian. Development. —The teeth of reptiles are never completed, as in certain fishes, at the first or papillary stage; but the pulp sinks into a follicle, and becomes inclosed by a cap- sule; and in certain reptiles this becomes more or less surrounded by bone ; but the process of development never offers the erup- tive stage, in the sense in which this is usually understood, as signifying the extrica- tion of the young tooth from a closed alveolus. The completion of a tooth, with the extinct exception of the Dicynodont Reptiles, is soon followed by preparation for its removal and succession: the faculty of developing new tooth-germs seems to be unlimited in the pre- sent class, and the phenomena of dental deca- dence and replacement are manifested at every period of life; the number of teeth is gene- rally the same in each successive series, and the difference of size presented by the teeth of different and distant series is considerable. The new germ is always developed, in the first instance, at the side of the base of the old tooth, never in the cavity of the base ; the crocodiles form no exception to this rule. The poison-fangs of serpents succeed each other from behind forwards; in almost every other instance the germ of the successional tooth is developed at the inner side of the base of its predecessor. In the frog the dental germ makes its appearance in the form of a papilla developed from the bottom and towards the outer side of a small fissure in the mucous membrane or gum that fills up the shallow groove at the inner side of the alveolar parapet and its adherent teeth: the papilla is soon enveloped by a capsular pro- cess of the surrounding membrane : there is a small enamel pulp developed from the cap- sule opposite the apex of the tooth ; the de- position of the earthy salts in this mould is accompanied by ossification of the capsule, which afterwards proceeds £>a?i passu with the calcification of the dentinal papilla or pulp; so that, with the exception of its base, the surface of the uncalcified part of the pulp alone remains normally unadherent to the cap- sule. As the tooth acquires hardness and size, it presses against the base of the contiguous attached tooth, causes a progressive absorp- tion of that part, and finally undermines, dis- places, and replaces its predecessor. The number of nascent matrices of the successional teeth is so great in the frog, and they are crowded so close together, that it is not unusual to find the capsules of contiguous tooth-germs becoming adherent together, as their ossification proceeds. After a brief ma- ceration, the soft gum may be stripped from the shallow alveolar depression, and the younger tooth-germs in different stages of growth are brought away with it. The mode of development of the teeth of serpents does not differ essentially from that of the teeth of the Batrachian above described except in the relation of the papilla? of the successional poison-fangs to the branch of the poison-duct that traverses the cavity of the loose mucous gum in which they are deve- loped. Batrachian modifications.— Some of the pe- culiarities of the dentition of the Batrachians have already been noticed, as in the compa- rison of the Siren with the Lepidosiren, in which the true amphibian was shown to have numerous teeth on the palate and lower jaw.* The piscine character of rasp-like teeth aggregated in numerous series, is manifested also in the Axolotlf, upon the palatal region of the mouth, and upon the splenial or oper- cular element of the lower jaw ; but the superior maxillary bones are here developed, and also support teeth. The premandibular and the premaxillary bones, instead of pre- serving the larval condition of the horny sheath, have their alveolar border armed with a single row of small, equal, fine and sharp- pointed denticles, which are continued above, along the maxillaries; thus establishing the commencement of the ordinary Batrachian condition of the marginal teeth of the buccal cavity. The dentigerous bones of the palate consist of two plates on each side, as in the Siren ; the anterior pair, or vomerine bones, converge and meet at their anterior extre- mities ; the minute denticles which they sup- port are arranged quincuncially ; the posterior pair of bones are continued backwards ac- cording to the usual disposition of the ptery- goids, to abut against the tympanic bones ; the denticles are confined to the anterior part of their oral surface, and resemble in their arrangement and anchylosed attachment those of the vomerine series, of which they form the posterior termination. The frogs (Rana) J have no teeth on the lower jaw ; but in some species the alveolar edge of this bone is finely notched or dentated, as in the horned frogs {Ceratophrys). The in- termaxillary and maxillary bones support a long, close-set, single series of small, conical, hollow teeth, of which the apices only project beyond the external alveolar ridge to which they are attached. A short transverse row of similar but smaller teeth extends along the posterior border of each vomer, except in the slender-armed frogs (JLeptobrachiuni), and in some of the tree frogs (e. g. JEuc7inemis), in which the roof of the mouth is edentulous. Amongst the most extraordinary examples of extinct reptiles are those w hich are charac- terised by the labyrinthic modification of the dental structure above described, and which with some affinities to Saurians, combine characters which are essentially those of the order Batrachia. I have ascertained by fossil portions of the upper jaw of the Labyrinthodon leptognathus that the maxillary or facial divi- sion of the skull was broad, much depressed, and flattened, resembling the skull of the * Odontography, pi. 62, figs. 5 & G t lb. pi. 62,fig. 4. t lb. pi. (X,fi(/. 10. 3 L 3886 TEETH. gigantic Salamander anil of the Alligator; and the outer surface of the bones was strongly sculptured, as in the Crocodilian family, but of a relatively larger and coarser pattern. The upper jaw contains a single row of small teeth, about sixty in number, anterior to which are three or four large conical tusks. The bases of the serial teeth project directly from the outer wall of the shallow socket, there being no alveolar ridge external to it. The second large anterior tusk is three times the size of the first of the serial teeth, and the size of these teeth gradually diminishes as they are placed further back ; the length of the common-sized teeth being about two lines, and the greatest breadth one-third of a line. The apical two-thirds of each tooth is smooth, but the basal third is fluted and anchylosed to the outer wall of the socket. The osseous roof of the mouth is principally composed of a pair of broad and flat bones, homologous with the divided vomer in Batrachia, but of much greater relative extent, approaching, in this respect, those of the Menopome, and de- fending the mouth with a more extensive roof of bone than exists in any Lacertian reptile ; physiologically, therefore, the La- byrinthodon, in this part of its structure, comes nearest to the Crocodile; but the structure itself, morphologically, is essen- tially Batrachian.* In the Menopome f and gigantic Salamander, a row of small teeth ex- tends transversely across the anterior extre- mity of the vomerine bones; and the occur- rence in the Labyrinihodon of a similar row, consisting in each palatine bone of three median small teeth and two outer larger ones, marks most strongly its Batrachian nature; and from the outermost tooth a longitudinal row of small and equal-sized teeth is con- tinued backward along the exterior margin of the palatine bone. The whole of this series of palatal teeth is nearly concentric with the maxillary teeth. In Lacertine reptiles the examples of a row of palatal teeth are rare, and, when pre- sent, it is short, and situated towards the back of the palate, upon {he pterygoid bones, as in the Iguana and Mosasaur.J In Batra- chians the most common disposition of the palatal teeth is a transverse row placed at the anterior part of the divided vomer, as in Frogs, the Menopome and gigantic Salamander, and at the posterior part in certain toads. In the Amphiume, on the contrary, the palatal teeth form a nearly longitudinal series along the outer margin of the palatine bones. The Labyrinihodon combines both these disposi- tions of the palatal teeth. The lower jaw, like the upper, contains a series of small teeth, with a few larger tusks anterior to them, the serial teeth are long and slender, gradually diminishing in size towards the anterior por- tion of the jaw; the largest fossil portion which I have obtained presents a linear series of not less than fifty sockets, placed alter- * Odontography, pi. 63. A, fig. 3. t lb. pi. 62. figs. 1 & 2. % lb. pi. 68. nately, one nearer the inner, the next nearer the outer side of the jaw. The sockets of the teeth are shallower than in the upper jaw ; the outer wall is more developed than the inner, and the anchylosed bases of the teeth more nearly resemble, in their oblique position, those of existing Batrachia. With regard to the modification of the microscopic structure of the teeth, I may observe that, between the apex and the part where the inflected vertical folds of the cement com- mence, the tooth resembles, in the sim- plicity of its intimate structure, that of the entire tooth of ordinary Batrachia and most reptiles ; and in the lower or basal half of the tooth the labyrinthie structure above de- scribed commences, and gradually increases in complexity. In the genus Deirodon*, the teeth of the ordinary bones of the mouth are so small as to be scarcely perceptible ; and they appear to be soon lost, so that it has been described as edentulous, and has been called " Anodon." An acquaintance with the habits and food of this species has shown how admirably this apparent defect is adapted to its well- being. Its business is to restrain the undue increase of the smaller birds by devouring their eggs. Now if the teeth had existed of the ordinary form and proportions in the maxillary and palatal regions, the egg would have been broken as soon as it was seized, and much of the nutritious contents would have escaped from the lipless mouth of the snake in the act of deglutition ; but, owing to the almost edentulous state of the jaws, the egg glides along the expanded opening unbroken ; and it is not until it has reached the gullet, and the closed mouth prevents any escape of the nutritious matter, that the egg becomes exposed to instruments adapted for its perforation. These instruments consist of the inferior spinous pocessess (hyp- apophyses) of the seven or eight posterior cer- vical vertebrae, the extremities of which are capped by a layer of hard cement, and pene- trate the dorsal parietes of the oesophagus. They may be readily seen, even in very small subjects, in the interior of that tube, in which their points are directed backwards. The shell being sawed open longitudinally by these vertebral teeth, the egg is crushed by the contractions of the gullet, and is carried to the stomach, where the shell is no doubt soon dissolved by the acid gastric juice. In the Boa Cunstrictor, the teeth are slender, conical, suddenly bent backwards and inwards above their base of attachment; the crown is straight or very slightly curved, e. g. in the posterior teeth. The inter- maxillary bone supports four small teeth ; each maxillary bone has eight much larger ones, which gradually decrease in size as they are placed further back. There are eight or nine teeth of similar size and proportions in each premandibular bone. These teeth * The Coluber scaber of Linnaeus ; an arboreal serpent of South Africa.887 TEETH. are separated by wide intervals, from which other teeth, similar to those in place, have been detached. The base of each of the above teeth is extended transversely, com- pressed antero-posteriorly, and anchylosed to a shallow alveolus, extending obliquely across the shallower alveolar groove. An affinity to the lizard tribes is manifested by the greater development of the outer, as compared with the inner wall of the alveolar furrow. The palatine teeth, of which there are three or four in each palatal bone, are as large as the superior maxillary, and are similarly attached. The pterygoid teeth, five or six in number, which complete the internal dental series on the roof of the mouth, are of smaller size, and gradually diminish as they recede backwards. In the interspaces of the fixed teeth in both these bones, the places of attachment of the shed teeth are always visible ; so that the dental formula, if it included the vacated with the occupied sockets, would express a greater number of teeth than are ever in place and use at the same time.* In the smaller species of Boa, the intermaxillary bone is edentulous. The Colubers, like other true serpents, have two longitudinal rows of teeth on the roof of the mouth, extending along the palatines and pterygoids. The genus Oligodon appears to form the sole exception to this rule. In the Drybius nasulus, a few small teeth are present on the ecto-pterygoid as well as on the pterygoid. In certain genera of non-poisonous ser- pents, as Dryophis, Dipsas, and Bucephalus, in which the superior maxillary teeth increase in size towards the posterior part of the bone, the large terminal teeth of the series are traversed along their anterior and convex side by a longitudinal groove. In the Bu- cephalus capensis, the two or three poste- rior maxillary teeth present this structure, and are much larger than the anterior teeth, or those of the palatine and premandibular series. They add materially, therefore, to the power of retaining the prey, and may conduct into the wounds which they inflict an acrid saliva ; but they are not in con- nection with the duct of an express poison- gland. The long-grooved fangs are either firmly fixed to the maxillary bones, or are slightly moveable, according to their period of growth. They are concealed by a sheath of thick and soft gum, and their points are directed backwards. The sheath always contains loose recumbent grooved teeth, ready to succeed those in place. In most of the C'olubri, each maxillary and premandibular bone includes from twenty to twenty-five teeth. They are less numerous in the genera Tortrix and Homahpsis, and are reduced to a still smaller number in the poisonous serpents, in the typical genera of which the short maxillary bone supports only a single perforated fang. * Odontography, pi. Go,fys. G & 7. Poisonous Serpents. — The transition to these serpents, which was begun in the Bueephali and allied genera with grooved maxillary teeth, is completed by the poisonous serpents of the genera Pclamis, Hydrophis, Elaps, Bongarus, and Hamadryas. The superior maxillary bone diminishes in length with the decreasing number of teeth which it supports. The eeto-pterygoid bone elongates in the same ratio, so as to retain its position as an abutment against the shortened maxillary, and the muscles implanted into this external pterj'goid bone communicate through it to the maxillary bone the hinge-like movements backwards and forwards upon the ginglymoid articulations connecting that bone with the prefrontal and palatine hones. As the fully-developed poison-fangs are at- tached by the same firm basal anchylosis to maxillary sockets, which forms the charac- teristic mode of attachment of the simple or solid teeth, they necessarily follow all the movements of the superior maxillary bone. When the external pterygoid is retracted, the superior maxillary rotates backwards, and the poison-fang is concealed in the lax mucous gum, with its point turned backwards. When the muscles draw forward the external ptery- goid, the superior maxillary bone is pushed forwards, and the recumbent fang withdrawn from its concealment and erected. In this power of changing the direction of a large tooth, so that it may not impede the passage of food through the mouth, we may perceive an analogy between the viper and the Lophius; but in the fish the movement is confined to the tooth alone, and is depen- dent on the mere physical property of the elastic medium of attachment; in the serpent the tooth has no independent motion, but rotates with the jaw, whose movements are governed by muscular actions. In the fish the great teeth are erect, except when pressed down by some extraneous force. In the ser- pent the habitual position of the fang is the recumbent one, and its erection takes place only when the envenomed blow is to be struck. A true idea of the structure of a poison- fang will be formed by supposing the crown of a simple tooth, as that of a boa, to be pressed flat, and its edges to be then bent towards each other, and soldered together so as to form a hollow cylinder, or rather cone, open at both ends. The flattening of the fang and its inflection around the poison-dutt commences immediately above the base, and the suture of the inflected margins runs along the anterior and convex side of the recurved fang, as shown in fig. 567, a. : the poison- canal is thus in front of the pulp-cavity, as shown in the longitudinal section of the fang b. The basal aperture of the poison-canal v is oblique, and its opposite outlet v' is still more so, presenting the form of a narrow elliptical longitudinal fissure terminating at a short distance from the apex of the fang. The relative position of the two apertures of the poison-canal is shown in the figure of 3i, 4TEETH. 888 the fang of the large Cobra in my " Odonto- graphy " (pi. 65. fig. 9., and in Vol". IV. p. 290. Jig. 210., art. Reftilia), where a fine hair is represented as passing through the poison- canal. The poison-glands occupy the sides of the posterior half of the head ; each gland con- sists of a number of elongated narrow lobes, extending from the main duct, which runs along the lower border of the gland upwards and slightly backwards: each lobe gives ofF lobules throughout its extent, thus presenting a pinnatifid structure; and each lobule is subdivided into smaller secerning caeca, which constitute the ultimate structure of the gland. The whole gland is surrounded by a double aponeurotic capsule, of which the outermost and strongest layer is in connection with the muscles by whose contraction the several caeca and lobes of the gland are compressed and emptied of their secretion. This is then con- veyed by the duct (see Reptilia, Vol. IV. p. 291., Jig. 211. e) to the basal aperture of the poison-canal of the fangj£ We may suppose, that as the analogous lachrymal and salivary- glands in other animals are most active during particular emotions, so the rage which stimu- lates the venom-snake to use its deadly weapon must be accompanied with an increased secre- tion and great distension of the poison-glands ; and as the action of the compressing muscles is contemporaneous with the blow by which the serpent inflicts the wound, the poison is at the same moment injected with force into the wound from the apical outlet of the per- forated fang. The duct which conveys the poison, al- though it runs through the centre of a great part of the tooth, is really on the outside of the tooth, the canal in which it is lodged and protected being formed by a longi- tudinal inflection of the dentinal parietes of the pulp-cavity. This inflection com- Fig. 567. A B Poison-fangs of Serpents. {Magnified.') mences a little beyond the base of the tooth, where its nature is readily appreciated, as the poison-duct there rests in a slight groove or longitudinal indentation on the convex side of the fang; as it proceeds it sinks deeper into the substance of the tooth, and the sides of the groove meet and seem to coalesce, so that the trace of the inflected fold ceases, in some species, to be perceptible to the naked eye ; and the fang appears, as it is commonly described, to be perforated by the duct of the poison-gland. In the Hydrofhk the groove remains permanently open, as in fig 567. c. From the real nature of the poison-canal it follows that the transverse section of the tooth varies in form in different parts of the tooth ; at the base it is oblong, with a large pulp-cavity of a corresponding form, with an entering notch at the anterior surface; farther on the transverse section presents the form of a horse-shoe, and the pulp-cavity that of a crescent, the horns of which extend into the sides of the deep cavity of the poison- fang : a little beyond this part the section of the tooth itself is crescentic, with the horns obtuse and in contact, so as to circumscribe the poison-canal; and along the whole of the middle four-sixths of the tooth, the section, of which a magnified view is given in Jig. 568., Fig. 568. Section of poison-fang of Serpent. {Magnified.) shows the dentine of the fang inclosing the poison-canal, and having its own centre or pulp-canal (p,p), in the form of a crescentic fissure, situated close to the concave border of the inflected surface of the tooth. The pulp- cavity disappears, and the poison-canal again resumes the form of a groove near the apex of the fang, and terminates on the anterior surface in an elongated fissure. The venom-fangs of the viper, rattle-snake, and the Fer-de-lance are coated only with a thin layer of a subtransparent and minutely cellular cement. The disposition of the den- tinal tubes is obedient to the general law of verticality to the external surface of the tooth ; it is represented as seen in the transverse sec- tion from the middle of the fang mfig. 568. Since the inflected surface of the tooth can be exposed to no other pressure than that ofTEETH. 889 the turgescent duct with which it is in con- tact, the tubes which proceed to the surface d, while maintaining their normal relation of the right angle to it, are extremely short; and the layer of dentine separating the poison- tube from the pulp-cavity is proportionally thin. The calcigerous tubes that radiate from the opposite side of the pulp-cavity to the exposed surface b of the tooth are dispropor- tionally long. The teeth of Ophidians are developed and completed in that part which forms the ori- ginal seat of the tooth-germs in all animals ; viz. the mucous membrane or gum covering, the alveolar border of the dentigerous bones. This germ presents the same lax tissue, and is as abundantly developed, as in the Pike, Lophius, and many other fishes ; in which it likewise serves as the nidus and locality for the complete development of the teeth. The primitive dental papillae in the common harm- less snake very soon sinks into the substance of the gum, and becomes inclosed by a cap- sule. As soon as the deposition of the cal- careous salts commences in the apex of the papilla the capsule covering that part becomes ossified and adherent to the dentine, and the tooth begins to pierce and emerge from the gum before its mould, the pulp, is half com- pleted. Fresh layers of cells are successively added to the base of the pulp, and converted, by their confluence and calcification, into the tubular dentine, until the full size of the tooth is attained, when its situation in the gum is gradually changed, and its base becomes anchylosed to the shallow cavity of the alve- olar surface of the bone. In the posterior part of the large mucous sheath of the poison-fang, the successors of this tooth are always to be found in different stages of development ; the pulp is at first a simple papilla, and when it has sunk into the gum the succeeding portion presents a depression along its inferior surface, as it lies horizontally, with the apex directed back- wards; the capsule adheres to this inflected surface of the pulp ; and the base of the groove of the loose, growing, poison-fang is brought into the same relation with the duct of the poison gland as the displaced fang, which has been severed from the duct. Saurians. — The existing species of lizards difFer from those of the crocodile in the anchy- losed condition of the teeth, which present few modifications of importance ; those that yield most fruit to physiology, and which have most expanded our ideas of the extent of the re- sources of Nature and the exceptional devi- ations from what was deemed the rule of structure in the Saurian dentition, have been discovered by the study of the fossil teeth of extinct forms of the order. Amongst these the most extraordinary in respect of their dental system have been recently discovered in aform- ation in South Africa, which seems nearly as ancient as our own coal-seams. I have called them " Dicynodonts,"* from their dentition being reduced to one long and large canine tooth on each side of the upper jaw. As these teeth give, at first sight, a character to the jaws like that which the long poison-fangs give, when erected, to the jaws of the rattle- snake, I shall briefly notice their characters before entering upon the description of the more normal Saurian dentition. Fig. 509. gives a reduced side view of the skull of the species of Dicynodon called D. la- certiceps. The cranial cavity (8, 8) is extremely contracted, as in all the cold-blooded quad- rupeds : it is bounded on each side by wide and deep temporal fossae (7) indicating power- ful muscles for the action of the lower jaw. The orbits (o) are large and round ; the nos- trils (n) are divided by the junction of the nasal bones (15) with the premaxillaries (22), as in lizards ; there is not a single median external nostril, as in Chelonian and Croco- dilian reptiles. The alveolar border of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary part of the * From iii, two, and xmilov;, the name given by Hippocrates to the canine teeth, and signifying the same idea as their common English denomination. Fig. 569. Skull of Dicynodon lacerticeps, one-third natural size.890 TEETH. upper jaw is trenchant, and seems to have been sheathed with horn. The maxillary bone (21) is excavated by a wide and deep alveolus, with a circular area of half an inch, and lodges a long and strong, slightly curved, and sharp-pointed, canine tooth or tusk, which projects about two-thirds of its length from the open extremity of the socket. The direction of the tusks is forwards, down- wards, and very slightly inwards ; the two converging, as they descend along the outer side of the compressed symphysis of the lower jaw (c). The tusk is principally composed of a body of compact unvascular dentine. The base is excavated by a wide conical pulp-cavity (p) with the apex extend- ing to about one-half of the implanted part of the tusk, and a linear tract is continued along the centre of the solid part of the tusk. From this central line the dentinal tubes radiate, with a gentle curve at the beginning, convex towards the point of the tusk, and then proceeding straight to the periphery of the tooth, but inclining towards the apex. They present parallel secondary curves, divide di- chotomously twice or thrice near their begin- ning, and send off numerous small lateral branches, chiefly from the side next the apex. At their primary curve the dentinal tubes are T5-l_th of an inch in diameter, and their intervals are g0o0th of an inch across. The dentinal cells are most conspicuous near the periphery of the tooth, and vary in diameter from -g^th to 1„1uuth of an inch. The enamel, at least at the middle of the tusk, is thinner than in the teeth of the cro- codile. It presents only a finely lamellated texture, the layers being parallel with the surface of the dentine on which it rests. There is only a fine linear trace of cement on the exterior of the sections of the implanted base of the tusks ; and here it is too thin to allow of the development of the radiated cells in its substance. There is no trace of teeth or their sockets in the lower jaw (25, 23); so much of the alveolar border as is exposed pre- sents a smooth and even edge, which seems to have played like a scissor-blade upon the inner side of the corresponding edentulous border of the upper jaw ; and it is most probable, from the analogies of similarly-shaped jaws of existing Reptilia, that the fore part of both the upper and under jaws were sheathed with horn. Until the discovery of the Rhynchosaurus*, this edentulous and horn-sheathed condition of the jaws was supposed to be peculiar to the Chelonian order among reptiles; and it is not one of the least interesting features of the Dicynodonts of the African sandstones, that they should repeat a Chelonian character, hitherto peculiar, amongst Lacertians, to the above-cited remarkable extinct edentulous genus of the new red sandstone of Shrop- shire : but our interest rises almost to as- tonishment, when, in a Saurian skull, we find, superadded to the horn-clad mandibles * Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, vol. vii. part iii. of the Tortoise, a pair of tusks, borrowed as it were from the mammalian class, or rather foreshadowing a structure which, in the actual creation, is peculiar to certain members of the highest organised warm-blooded animals. In the other Reptilia, recent or extinct, which most nearly approach the Mammalia in the structure of their teeth, the difference characteristic of the inferior and cold-blooded class is manifested in the shape, and in the system of shedding and succession, of the teeth : the base of the implanted teeth seldom becomes consolidated, never contracted to a point, as in the fangs of the simple teeth of Mammalia, and at all periods of growth one or more germs of teeth are formed within or near the base of the tooth in use, prepared to succeed it, and progressing towards its dis- placement. The dental armature of the jaws is kept in serviceable order by uninterrupted change and succession ; but the matrix of the individual tooth is soon exhausted, and the life of the tooth itself may be said to be com- paratively short. The Dicynodonts not only manifest the higher type of free implantation of the base of the tooth in a deep and complete socket, common to Crocodilians, Megalosaurs, and Thecodonts, but make an additional and much more important step towards the mammalian type of dentition, by maintaining the service- able state of the tusk by virtue of constant renovation of the substance of one and the same matrix, accordingly to the principle manifested in the long-lived and ever-growing tusks of the Walrus, and the scalpriform in- cisors of the Rodentia. The genera of the typical family of the squamate Lacertians are arranged in two sub-families, the chief characteristics of which are derived from the dental system. In the first group, the teeth are solid, or without any permanent internal cavity, and are very firmly anchylosed by their base to the alveolar groove upon the inner side of the jaw ; so that the extremity of the tooth is slightly directed outwards. The species which present this character are called Pleo- donts. In the second group, the teeth are ex- cavated, or retain the pulp-cavity, and are less firmly fixed to the jaws, being applied vertically, like piles or buttresses, against the outer alveolar parapet, but not adhering by their base. This group is called Coelodonts. The Monitor Lizard of S. America is an example of the Pleodont group, in which the premaxillary teeth are ten in number. The maxillary teeth vary from ten to fifteen on each side, and increase in size as they are placed farther back: the hindmost teeth are tricuspid in young individuals, and present the form of simple tubercles in the old Mo- nitors. The mandibular teeth, fifteen to eighteen in number in each ramus, correspond in size and form with those above. In the Ccelodont group, the "Swift lizards" (Tachy- dromus) have the pterygoid bones armed with minute teeth. The teeth on both upper andTEETH. 891 lower jaws are of larger size, and the hinder ones are tricuspid. The true lizards (La- certa) have two kinds of teeth quoad form ; the anterior small, conical, and recurved ; the posterior larger, and bi- or tri-cuspid. Some species have also pterygoid teeth; as the common Laccrta agilis. In the Gigantic fossil Monitor of Maes- tricht, the teeth combine the Pleodont with the Acrodont* characters. The true affinities of the Mosasaur, which was at least twenty-four feet in length, and the remains of which characterise the chalk- formations, were first determined by Cuvier, who places it in the Lacertian group of Saurians, between the Iguanae and Monitors. Its dentition exhibits in an eminent degree the Acrodont character; the teeth being sup- ported on expanded conical bases anchylosed to the summit of the alveolar ridge of the jaw: no existing Saurian exactly parallels this mode of attachment of the teeth, either in regard to the breadth of the alveolar border, or in the relative size of the osseous cones to the teeth which they support. A shallow socket is left where the tooth and its supporting base are shed. The form of the teeth is likewise different from that hitherto observed in any existing Saurian : the crown is pyramidal, with the outer side nearly plane, or slightly convex, and separated by two sharp ridges from the remaining sur- face, which forms a half-cone. All the teeth account of the Mosasaurus, " has no true root, but it adheres strongly to that pulp which has secreted it, and it is further held in connection with it by the remains of the capsule which has furnished the enamel, and which, by becoming ossified also, and uniting itself to the maxillary bone and the ossified pulp, implants or rivets the tooth with addi- tional force." The necessity under which Cuvier felt himself compelled to regard the crown and the base of the tooth of the Mosasaur as two distinct parts, is at once banished by the recognition of the principle, that the processes of calcification are essentially the same at every part of a tooth, whether it be free or anchylosed ; and that they are modified only, as 1 have shown in my Memoir on the Formation of the Teeth of the Shark*, ac- cording to the density of the part to be pro- duced. Scincokl Lizards.—Most of these smooth- scaled lizards have small mouths and slender sharp teeth, fitted best for insect food ; they are usually confined to the upper and lower jaws ; but the medicinal Scink of ancient pharmacy (Soincus officinalis) has four or five small obtuse teeth upon each pterygoid bone. The chief exception to the typical dentition of the present family is made by the large scincoid lizards of Australia, which, on that account, have received the generic name of Cj/c/odus.f Fig. 570. Lower jaw and teeth of Cyelodus niaro/uteus. are slightly recurved, and their peripheral surface is smooth. The teeth are implanted upon the premaxillary, maxillary, and pre- mandibulary bones ; a series of similarly shaped but much smaller teeth are placed upon the pterygoid bones. The gradual transition from the simple structure of the compact dentine to theosteo- dentine of the anchylosed base of the tooth was not known to Cuvier; otherwise he could not have supposed that the crown and the base of the tooth of the Mosasaurus were formed by vital processes of so dissimilar a nature as to forbid him considering them as parts of one and the same body. Cuvier had originally described the expanded base of the tooth of the Mosasaur as the root of the tooth ; but afterwards, observing that the corresponding base became anchylosed by ossification of the remains of the pulp to the jaw, he conceived it to be incorrect to regard it as a part of a body which he believed to be an inorganic product, and the result of excretion. " The tooth," he observes, in correcting his first * Odontography, pp. 241. 258. The dentition of the Cycl. nigrohdeus is exemplified in the lower jaw, fig. 570. In the upper jaw, the single premaxillary bone has depressions for twelve teeth, of which only the alternate ones are usually in place ; they are of very small size, with the fang com- pressed laterally, and the crown antero- posterior]}', so as to resemble a true incisor in form, the summit sloping to an edge from behind forwards, with the middle of the cut- ting surface a little produced. Each superior maxillary bone has depressions for fourteen teeth ; they quickly increase in size, and exchange their conical for a sub-hemispherical crown; the eighth to the thirteenth inclusive are the largest teeth ; they are set obliquely, and pretty close together. In the lower jaw there are two small incisors, at the anterior part of each premandibular bone correspond- ing with those of the premaxillary ; these are succeeded by five or six conical teeth, and the rest correspond in size and form with the tuberculate molars of the upper jaw. * Compte Rendu de l'Aeademie des Sciences, Deoembre, 1839. ■f Kouud-toothed : zvxXvs, round; <,l<w;, tooth.TEETH. 892 All the teeth are attached, after the Plenro- dont type, by their base and outer margin to shallow depressions on the outer side of the external alveolar parapet. The germs of the successional teeth, c. fig. 570., are developed at the inner side of the base of their predecessors, a, which they excavate, undermine, and displace in the usual manner. Iguanas.—Certain genera of this family of lizards, e. g. Istiurus, Lophyrus, Calotes, and Otocryptis, have the teeth soldered, like those of Mbsasaurus, to the summit of the alveolar ridge, and thence are called " Acrodonts : " in all these lizards the maxillary and mandibular teeth may be divided into anterior laniary, and posterior molary teeth. In most of the Iguanians the teeth are lodged in a common shallow oblique alveolar groove, and are soldered to excavations on the inner surface of the outer wall of the groove : these are called Pleurodonts. Most of them possess pterygoid as well as maxillary teeth; but the following genera, Hyperanodon, Tropido- lepis, Phrynosoma, and Callisaurus, are excep- tions. In the Pleurodont Iguanians, the teeth never present the true laniary form ; and if simply conical, as at the extremes of the maxillary series, the cone is more or less obtuse ; but, in general, it is expanded, more or less trilobate, or dentated along the mar- gin of the crown. The Amblyrhynchus, a genus which is some- what remarkable for the marine habits of at least one of the species {Amblyrhynchus ater'), whose diet is sea-weed*, has the tricuspid structure well developed in the posterior teeth. The typical genus of the present family of Saurians {Iguana tubercidala), is characterised by the crenate or dentated margin of the crown of the maxillary and premandibular teeth, a few of the anterior small ones ex- cepted. The pterygoid teeth are arranged in two or three irregular rows, resembling somewhat the " dents en cardes " of fishes. In the full-grown Iguana tubcrcidata there are from forty-seven to forty-nine teeth in both upper and lower jaws. The number is less in young subjects. The double row of pterygoid teeth are in close order on each side. In the horned Iguana (MetopocLros cor- nutus), there are about fifty-six teeth in the upper and lower jaws, of which the four first are conical and slightly recurved. The twelve succeeding teeth are somewhat larger in size, with more compressed and expanded crowns ; the rest are triangular, compressed, with dentated margins. The inner surface of the crown of the tooth is simply convex and * This species, and probably all the known Am- Uyrhynchi, or blunt-nosed Iguanoe, inhabit the islands in the Galopagos group; their habits have been well elucidated by Mr. Darwin (Voyage of the Beagle, vol. iii. p. 466.). In specimens which he dissected, he found the stomach loaded with minced sea-weed. smooth ; the outer surface traversed by a me- dian, longitudinal, broad, obtuse ridge. There is a single row of small teeth implanted in each pterygoid bone. No Iguanian lizard has teeth on the palatine bones. The teeth of the Iguanodon, though re- sembling those of the Iguana, do not present an exact magnified image of them, but differ in the greater relative thickness of the crown, its more complicated external surface, and, still more essentially, in a modification of the internal structure, by which the Iguanodon equally deviates from every other known reptile. As in the Iguana, the base of the tooth is elongated, contracted, and subcylindrical ; the crown expanded, and smoothly convex on the inner side. When first formed, it is acu- minated, compressed, its sloping sides ser- rated, and its external surface traversed by a median longitudinal ridge, and coated by a layer of enamel, but, beyond this point, the description of the tooth of the Iguanodon indicates characters peculiar to that genus. In most of the teeth that have hitherto been Fig. 571. Unworn tootii of Iguanodon. found, three longitudinal ridges (fig. 571.) traverse the outer surface of the crown, one on each side of the median primitive ridge ; these are separated from each other, and from the serrated margins of the crown, by four wide and smooth longitudinal grooves. The relative width of these grooves varies iii different teeth ; sometimes a fourth small lon- gitudinal ridge is developed on the outer side of the crown. The marginal serrations, which, at first sight, appear to be simple notches, as in the Iguana, present, under a low magnifying power, the form of trans- verse ridges, themselves notched, so as to resemble the mammilated margins of the un- worn plates of the elephant's grinder: slight grooves lead from the interspaces of these notches upon the sides of the marginal ridges. These ridges, or dentations, do not extend beyond the expanded part of the crown: the longitudinal ridges are continued further down, especially the median ones, which do not subside till the fang of the tooth begins to assume its subcylindrical form. The tooth at first increases both in breadth and thick- ness ; it then diminishes in breadth, but its thickness goes on increasing ; in the larger and fully formed teeth, the fang de-TEETH. 893 creases in every diameter, and sometimes tapers almost to a point. The smooth un- broken surface of such fangs indicates that they did not adhere to the inner side of the maxillae, as in the Iguana, but were placed in separate alveoli, as in the Cro- codile and Megalosaurj such support would appear, indeed, to be indispensable to teeth so worn by mastication as those of the Igu- anodon. A fracture of this tooth shows that the pulp was not entirely solidified, but that its cavity had continued open at the thickest part of the tooth. The apex of the tooth soon begins to be worn away, and it would appear, by many specimens that have been found, that the teeth were retained until nearly the whole of the crown had yielded to the daily abrasion. In these teeth, however, the deep excavation of the remaining fang, represented in profile in the figure fig. 571., plainly bespeaks the pro- gress of the successional tooth prepared to supply the place of the worn-out grinder. At the earlier stages of abrasion, a sharp edge is maintained at the external part of the tooth by means of the enamel which covers that surface of the crown. The prominent ridges upon that surface give a sinuous contour to the middle of the cutting edge, whilst its sides are jagged by the lateral serrations. The adaptation of this admirable dental instrument to the cropping and com- minution of such tough vegetable food as the ClathraricB and similar plants, which are found buried "with the Iguanodon, is pointed out by Dr. Buckland, with his usual felicity of il- lustration, in his " Bridgewater Treatise," vol. i. p. 246. When the crown is worn away beyond the enamel, it presents a broad and nearly hori- zontal grinding surface, and now another dental substance is brought into use to give an inequality to that surface ; this is the ossified remnant of the pulp, which, being firmer than the surrounding dentine, forms a slight transverse ridge in the middle of the grinding surface. The tooth in this stage has exchanged the functions of an incisor for that of a molar, and is prepared to give the final compression, or comminution, to the coarsely divided vegetable matters. The marginal edge of the incisive condition of the tooth and the median ridge of the molar stage are more effectually established by the introduction of a modification into the texture of the dentine, by which it is rendered softer than in the existing Iguanse and other reptiles, and more easily worn away : this is effected by an arrest of the calcifying process along certain cylindrical tracts of the pulp, which is thus continued, in the form of medullary canals, analogous to those in the soft dentine of the Megatherium's grinder, from the central cavity, at pretty regular intervals, parallel with the calcigerous tubes, nearly to the surface of the tooth. The medullary canals radiate from the internal and lateral sides of the pulp-cavity, and are confined to the dentine forming the corre- sponding walls of the tooth; their diameter is 1555th of an inch ; they are separated by pretty regular intervals, equal to from six to eight of their own diameters ; they some- times divide once in their course. Each medullary canal is surrounded by a clear sub- stance ; its cavity was occupied in the section described by a substance of a deeper yellow colour than the rest of the dentine. The calcigerous tubes present a diameter of j^00th of an inch, with interspaces equal to about four of their diameters. At the first part of their course, near the pulp-cavity, they are bent in strong undulations, but after- wards proceed in slight and regular primary curves, or in nearly straight lines, to the periphery of the tooth. When viewed in a longitudinal section of the tooth, the concavity of the primary curvature is turned towards the base of the tooth; the lowest tubes are inclined towards the root, the rest have a general direction at right angles to the axis of the tooth ; the few calcigerous tubes, which proceed vertically to the apex, are soon worn away, and can be seen only in a section of the apical part of the crown of an incompletely developed tooth. The secondary undulations of each tooth are regular and very minute. The branches, both primary and secondary, of the calcigerous tubes are sent off from the concave side of the main inflections; the minute secondary branches are remarkable at certain parts of the tooth for their flexuous ramifications, anastomoses, and dilatations into minute calcigerous cells, which take place along nearly parallel lines for a limited extent of the course of the main tubes. The ap- pearance of interruption in the course of the calcigerous tubes, occasioned by this modi- fication of their secondary branches, is repre- sented by the irregularly dotted tracts in the figure of the dental structure of this ancient reptile given in my " Odontography." This modification must contribute, with the me- dullary canals, though in a minor degree, in producing that inequality of texture and of density in the dentine, which renders the broad and thick tooth of the Iguanodon more efficient as a triturating instrument. The enamel which invests the harder dentine, forming the outer side of the tooth, presents the same peculiar dirty brown colour, when viewed by transmitted light, as in most other teeth : very minute and scarcely per- ceptible undulating fibres, running vertically to the surface of the tooth, is the only struc- ture I have been able to detect in it. The cement is simply and minutely cellular upon the crown of the tooth, but it exhibits the radiated cells at the base of the tooth. The remains of the pulp in the contracted cavity of the completely formed tooth arc converted into a dense but true osseous substance, characterised by minute elliptical radiated cells, whose long axis is parallel with the plane of the concentric lamellae, which surround the few and contracted medullary canals in this substance.TEETH. 894 The microscopical examination of the struc- ture of the Iguanodon's teeth thus contributes additional evidence of the perfection of their adaptation to the offices to which their more obvious characters had indicated them to have been destined. To preserve a trenchant edge, a partial coating of enamel is applied; and, that the thick body of the tooth might be worn away in a more regularly oblique plane, the dentine is rendered softer as it recedes from the enameled edge by the simple contrivance of arresting the calcifying process along certain tracts of the inner wall of the tooth. When attrition has at length exhausted the enamel and the tooth is limited to its functions as a grinder, a third substance has been prepared in the ossified remnant of the pulp to add to the efficiency of the dental instrument in its final capacity. And if the following reflections were natural and just after a review of the external characters of the dental organs of the Iguanodon, their truth and beauty be- come still more manifest as our knowledge of their subject becomes more particular and exact: " In this curious piece of animal mechanism we find a varied adjustment of all parts and proportions of the tooth, to the exercise of peculiar functions, attended by compensations adapted to shifting conditions of the in- strument, during different stages of its con- sumption. And we must estimate the works of nature by a different standard from that which we apply to the productions of human art, if we can view such examples of me- chanical contrivance, united with so much economy of expenditure, and with such anti- cipated adaptations to varying conditions in their application, without feeling a profound conviction that all this adjustment has re- sulted from design and high intelligence."* Varanians.—In the great Crocodilian Moni- tor (Varanus crocodilinus), the large fixed com- pressed teeth, of which there may be about seven in each upper maxillary bone and six in each premandibular, are anchylosed by the whole of their base and by an oblique surface leading upwards on the outer side of the tooth to a slight depression on the oblique alveolar surface, as in the Var. striatus. The base of the tooth is finely striated, the lines being produced by inflected folds of the external cement, as in the Ichthyosaur and Labyrinthodon, but they are short and straight, as in those of the former genus. The alveolar channel or groove has scarcely any depth; but the anchylosed base of the tooth is applied to an oblique surface, terminating in a sharp edge, from which the outer side of the free crown of the tooth is directly continued. The great Varanus, like the variegated species manifests its affinity to the Crocodilians in the number of successive teeth which are in progress of growth to replace each other ; but from the position in which the germs of the successional teeth are developed, the more * Buekland's Bridge-water Treatise, vol. i. p. 249. advanced teeth in this species, as in the Var. varicgatus, do not exhibit the excavations that characterise the same parts of the teeth of the Enaliosaurs and Crocodiles. Thecodonts. —We have seen that among the inferior or squamate Saurians there are two leading modifications in the mode of attach- ment of the teeth, the base of which may be either anchylosed to the summit of an alveolar ridge, or to the bottom of an alveolar groove, and supported by its lateral wall. These modifications are indicated respectively by the terms " Acrodont" and " Pleurodont." A third mode of fixation is presented by seme extinct Saurians, which, in other parts of their organisation, adhere to the squamate or Lacertine division of the order, the teeth being implanted in sockets, either loosely or confluent with the bony walls of the cavity ; these I have termed the " Thecodont"* La- certians : the most ancient of all Saurians belong to this group ; viz. the Thuringian Monitor, or Protorosaurm, and the Paloeo- saurus of the dolomitic conglomerates near Bristol. The compressed Varanian form of tooth, with trenchant and finely dentated margins, which characterised the ancient Pa- lceosaur and Chadeiodon, is continued in the comparatively more recent and gigantic species of terrestrial lizard, of which the remains were discovered by Dr. Buckland in the oolite of Stonesfield, by whom the peculiarities of the jaws and teeth have been accurately and gra- phically described in the following words : — " From these remains we learn that the animal was a reptile, closely allied to some of our modern lizards; and viewing the teeth as instruments for providing food to a carni- vorous creature of enormous magnitude, they appear to have been admirably adapted to the destructive office for which they have been designed. Their form and mechanism will be best explained by reference to the figures. " The outer margin of the jaw rises nearly an inch above its inner margin, forming a continuous lateral parapet to support the teeth on the exterior side, where the greatest support was necessary, whilst the inner margin throws up a series of triangular plates of bone forming a zigzag buttress along the interior of the alveoli. From the centre of each triangular plate, a bony partition crosses to the outer parapet, thus completing the successive alveoli. The new teeth are seen in the angle between each triangular plate, rising in reserve to supply the loss of older teeth, as often as progressive growth, or ac- cidental fracture, may render such renewal necessarj-, and thus affording an exuberant provision for a rapid succession and resto- ration of these most essential implements. They were formed in distinct cavities, by the side of the old teeth, towards the interior surface of the jaw, and probably expelled them by the usual process of pressure and absorption, insinuating themselves into the cavities thus left vacant. This contrivance * Odontography, part ii. p. 266.895 TEETH. for the renewal of teeth is strictly analogous to that which takes place in the dentition of many species of existing lizards. " In the structure of these teeth we find a combination of mechanical contrivances ana- logous to those which are adopted in the construction of the knife, the sabre, and the saw. When first protruded above the gum, the apex of each tooth presented a double cutting edge of serrated enamel. In this stage, its position and line of action were nearly vertical, and its form, like that of the two- edged point of a sabre, cutting equally on each side. As the tooth advanced in growth it became curved backwards in the form of a pruning-knife, and the edge of serrated enamel was continued downwards to the base of the inner and cutting side of the tooth, whilst on the outer side a similar edge descended but a short distance from the point, and the convex portion of the tooth became blunt and thick, as the back of a knife is made thick for the purpose of producing strength. The strength of the tooth was further in- creased by the expansion of its side. Had the serrature continued along the whole of the blunt and convex portion of the tooth, it would in this position have possessed no useful cutting power ; it ceased precisely at the point beyond which it could no longer be effective. In a tooth thus formed for cutting along its concave edge, each movement of the jaw combined the power of the knife and saw ; whilst the apex, in making the first incision, acted like the two-edged point of a sabre. The backward curvature of the full-grown teeth enabled them to retain, like barbs, the prey which they had penetrated. In these adaptations we see contrivances which human ingenuity has also adopted in the preparation of various instruments of art." * The teeth of the Megalosaur consist of a central body of dentine, with an investment of enamel upon the crown, and of cement over all, but thickest upon the fang. The marginal serrations are formed almost entirely by the enamel, and when slightly magnified are seen to be rounded, and separated by slight basal grooves ; the smooth and polished enamel upon the sides of the crown presents a finely wrinkled appearance; the remains of the pulp are converted into a coarse bone in the completely formed tooth. Enaliosaurs. — The teeth of the Ichthyo- sauri have a simple, more or less acutely conical form, with a long and, usually, ex- panded or ventricose base, or implanted fang. They are confined to the intermaxillary, max- illary, and premandibular bones, in which they are arranged in a pretty close and un- interrupted series, and are of nearly equal size. They consist of a body of unvascular dentine, invested at the base by a thick layer of cement, and at the crown by a layer of enamel, which is itself covered by a very thin coat of cement; the pulp-cavity is more or * Bridgewater Treatise, vol. i. p. 237; less occupied in fully-formed teeth by a coarse bone. The external surface of the tooth is marked by the longitudinal impressions and ridges, but the teeth vary both as to outward sculpturing and general form in the different species * The chief peculiarity of the dental system of the Ichthyosaur is the mode of the im- plantation of the teeth ; instead of being an- chylosed to the bottom and side of a con- tinuous shallow groove, as in most Lacertians, or implanted in distinct sockets, as in the The- codon, Megalosaur, or Pterodactyle, they are lodged loosely in a long and deep continuous furrow, and retained by slight ridges between the teeth, along the sides and bottom of the furrow, and by the gum and organised mem- branes continued into the groove and upon the base of the teeth. The germs of the new teeth are developed at the inner side of the base of the old ones. CrocodUia. — The best and most readily recognisable characters by which the existing Crocodilians are grouped in appropriate genera, are derived from modifications of the dental system. In the Caimans (genus Alligator) the teeth |g |g g9 90 vary in number from ——- to ——— : the J 18—18 22—22 fourth tooth of the lower jaw, or canine, is received into a cavity of the palatal surface of the upper jaw, where it is concealed when the mouth is shut. In old individuals the upper jaw is perforated by these large in- ferior canines, and the fossae are converted into foramina. In the Crocodiles (genus Crocodilus) the first tooth in the lower jaw perforates the palatal process of the premaxillary bone when the mouth is closed ; the fourth tooth in the lower jaw is received into a notch exca- vated in the side of the alveolar border of the upper jaw, and is visible externally when the mouth is closed. In the two preceding genera the alveolar borders of the jaw have an uneven or wavy contour, and the teeth are of an unequal size. In the Gavials (genus Gavialis) the teeth are nearly equal in size and similar in form in both jaws, and the first as well as the fourth tooth in the lower jaw, passes into a groove in the margin of the upper jaw when the mouth is closed. In the alligators and crocodiles the teeth are more unequal in size, and less regular in arrangement, and more diversified in form than in the Gavials: witness the strong thick conical laniary teeth as contrasted with the blunt mammillate summits of the posterior teeth in the alligator (fig. 573.). The teeth of the Gavial are subequal, most of them pre- sent the form of crown, shown in fig. 572., long, slender, pointed, subcompressed from before backwards, with a trenchant edge on the right and left sides, between which a few faint longitudinal ridges traverse the basal part of the enamelled crown. * Odontography, pi. 73.TEETH. 896 Fig. 572. Teeth in different stages of formation from one alveolus of the Gavial: a is the base partly absorbed by the pressure of b, the suecessional tooth ; below which is figured c, the germ of the next tooth to follow. Amongst the remains of Crocodilians which are scattered through the Tilgate strata, the most common ones are detached teeth, from the difference observable in the form of which, Dr. Mantell has observed, that " they appear referable to two kinds, the one belonging to that division of crocodiles with long slender muzzles, named Gavial, the other to a species of Crocodile, properly so-called, and resembling a fossil species found at Caen."* Dr. Mantell has obligingly communicated to me figures of well-preserved specimens of both the forms of teeth alluded to, the exact- ness of which I have recognised by a com- parison with the specimens themselves in the British Museum. The tooth which, from its more slender and acuminated form, approaches nearest to the character of those of the Gavial, presents a marked difference, however, from the teeth of any of the recent species of that sub-genus of Crocodilians, as well as from those of the long and slender-snouted extinct genera, called Teleosaurus, Steneosaurus, &c. I have described itf, therefore, as indicative of a distinct species, under the name of Crocodilus cultridens. The crown is laterally compressed, subincurved, with two opposite trenchant edges, one forming the concave, the other the convex, outline of the tooth. In the Gavial, the direction of the flattening of the crown and the situation of the trenchant edges are the reverse, the compression being from be- fore backwards, and the edges being lateral.J * Wonders of Geology, 1839, vol. i. p. 386. + Odontography, pi. lxii. A, figs. 9, 10. } The tooth attributed by M. Deslongehanips to the Poihilopleuron, agrees in form with those of The tooth of the Crocodilus cultridens thus re- sembles in form that of the Megalosaur, and perhaps still more those of the Argenton crocodile; but I have not observed any spe- cimens of the Wealden teeth in which the edges of the crown were serrated, as in both the reptiles just cited. The teeth of the Cro- codilus cultridens also present a character which does not exist in the teeth of the Megalosaur, and is not attributed by Cu- vier to those of the Crocodile a"Argenton. The sides of the crown are traversed by a few longitudinal parallel ridges, with regular intervals of about one line, in a crown of a tooth one inch and a half in length: these ridges subside before they reach the apex of the tooth, and more rapidly at the convex than at the concave side of the crown. Hitherto these teeth have not been found so associated with any part of the skeleton of the same species as to yield further cha- racters of the present extinct Crocodilian ; but from the above-mentioned well-marked differences between these teeth and those of all the existing species, it is most probable that the extinct crocodile formed the type of a distinct sub-genus, for which the term Su- chosaurus has been proposed. The second form of tooth having the gene- ric characters of those of the crocodile, which has been discovered in the Wealden and approximate strata, is as remarkable for its thick, rounded, and obtuse crown as the teeth of the preceding species are for their slender, compressed, acute, and trenchant character. It consequently approaches more nearly to the teeth which characterise the broad and comparatively short-snouted crocodiles; but it differs from these in one of the same cha- racters by which the tooth of the Suchosaurus cultridens differs from those of the Gavials, viz., in the longitudinal ridges which traverse the exterior of the crown. These are, how- ever, more numerous, more close-set, and more neatly defined than in the Suchosaurus cultridens. Two of the ridges, larger and sharper than the rest, traverse opposite sides of the tooth, from the base to the apex of the crown ; they are placed, as in the crocodile and Gavial, at the sides of the crown, midway between the convex and concave lines of the curvature of the tooth. These ridges are confined to the enamel ; the cement-covered cylindrical base of the tooth is smooth. The size of the teeth varies from a length of crown of two inches, with a basal diameter of one inch and a half to teeth of one-third of these dimensions. I have proposed to call this extinct crocodile, with biconcave vertebra;, Goniopholis crassidens. Development. — In the black alligator of Guiana the first fourteen teeth of the lower jaw are implanted in distinct sockets, the remaining posterior teeth are lodged close together in a continuous groove, in which the divisions for sockets are faintly indicated by vertical ridges, as in the jaws of the Ichthyo- the Gavial, and differs in the characters cited in the text from those of the Crocodilus cultridens.897 TEETH. saurs. A thin compact floor of bone separates this groove, and the sockets anterior to it, from the large cavity of the ramus of the jaw ; it is pierced by bloodvessels for the supply of the pulps of the growing teeth and the vas- cular dentiparous membrane which lines the alveolar cavities. The tooth-germ is developed from the membrane covering the angle between the floor and the inner wall of the socket. It becomes in this situation completely enveloped by its capsule, and an enamel-organ is formed at the inner surface of the capsule before the young tooth penetrates the interior of the pulp-cavity of its predecessor. The matrix of the young growing tooth affects, by its pressure, the inner wall of the socket, as shown in Jig. 573, and forms for Fig. 573. Section of lower jaw, with four alveoli and teeth, of the black Alligator. itself a shallow recess : at the same time it attacks the side of the base of the contained tooth ; then, gaining a more extensive attach- ment by its basis and increased size, it pene- trates the large pulp-cavity of the previously formed tooth either by a circular or semi- circular perforation. The size of the calcified part of the tooth-matrix which has produced the corresponding absorption of the previously formed tooth on the one side, and of the alveolar process on the other, is represented in the second exposed alveolus of Jig. 573., the tooth a having been displaced and turned round to show the effects of the stimulus of the pressure. The size of the perforation in the tooth, and of the depression in the jaw, proves them to have been, in great part, caused by the soft matrix, which must have produced its effect by exciting vital action of the absorbents, and not by mere mechanical force. The resistance of the wall of the pulp-cavity having been thus overcome, the growing tooth and its matrix recede from the temporary alveolar depression, and sink into the substance of the pulp contained in the VOL. IV. cavity of the fully-formed tooth. As the new tooth grows, the pulp of the old one is re- moved ; the old tooth itself is next attacked, and the crown being undermined by the ab- sorption of the inner surface of its base, may be broken off by a slight external force, when the point of the new tooth is exposed, as in the Jig. 573. b. The new tooth disembarrasses itself of the cylindrical base of its predecessor, with which it is sheathed, by maintaining the excitement of the absorbent process so long as the cement of the old fang retains any vital connection with the periosteum of the socket; but the frail remains of the old cylinder, thus re- duced, are sometimes lifted off the socket upon the crown of the new tooth, as in Jig. 573. b, when they are speedily removed by the action of the jaws. This is, however, the only part of the process which is immediately produced by mechanical force : an attentive observation of the more important previous stages of growth, teaches that the pressure of the growing tooth operates upon the one to be displaced only through the medium of the vital absorbent action which it has excited. Most of the stages in the development and succession of the teeth of the crocodiles are described by Cuvier with his wonted clearness and accuracy ; but the mechanical explanation of the expulsion of the old tooth, which Cuvier adopts from M. Tenon, is opposed by the disproportionate smallness of the hard part of the new tooth to the vacuity in the old one, and by the fact that the matter im- pressing— viz. the uncalcified part of the walls of the tooth-matrix—is less dense than the part impressed. No sooner has the young tooth penetrated the interior of the old one, than another germ begins to be developed from the angle between the base of the young tooth and the inner alveolar process, or in the same relative position as that in which its immediate pre- decessor began to rise, and the processes of succession and displacement are carried on, uninterruptedly, throughout the long life of these cold-blooded carnivorous reptiles. From the period of exclusion from the egg, the teeth of the crocodile succeed each other in the vertical direction ; none are added from behind forwards, like the true molars in Mammalia. It follows, therefore, that the number of the teeth of the crocodile is as great when it first sees the light as when it has acquired its full size; and, owing to the rapidity of the succession, the cavity at the base of the fully-formed tooth is never con- solidated. The fossil jaws of the extinct Crocodilians demonstrate that the same law regulated the succession of the teeth, at the ancient epochs when those highly organised reptiles prevailed in greatest numbers, and under the most varied generic and specific modifications, as at the present period, when they are reduced to a single family, composed of so few and slightly varied species as to have constituted 3 M898 TEETH. in the system of Linnaeus a small fraction of his genus Lacerta. Dental System of Mammals. The class Mammalia, like that of Rcptilia and Pisces, includes a few genera and species that are devoid of teeth : the true ant-eaters (Myrmecophaga), the scaly ant-eaters or Pan- golins {Mams), and the spiny monotrematous ant-eater (Echidna), are examples of strictly edentulous Mammals. The Ornithorkynchus has horny teeth, and the whales (Bahcna and BalcBnoptera) have transitory embryonic cal- cified teeth*, succeeded by whalebone sub- stitutesf in the upper jaw. Horny processes analogous to, perhaps homologous with, the lingual and palatal teeth in fishes, are present in the Echidna. The female Narwhal seems to be eden- tulous, but has the germs of two tusks in the substance of the upper jaw-bones; one of these becomes developed into a large and conspicuous weapon in the male Narwhal, and, accordingly, suggested to Linnaeus the name, for its genus, of Monodon, meaning single tooth : but the tusk is never median, like the truly single tooth on the palate of the Myxine ; and occasionally both tusks are developed in the Narwhal. In another Ceta- cean, the great Bottle-nose, or Hyperoodon, the teeth are reduced in the adult to two in number, whence the specific name H. bidens, but they are confined to the lower jaw. The sharp-nosed dolphin (Ziphius) has also but two teeth, one in each ramus of the lower jaw ; and this is, perhaps, a sexual character. The Delphinus griseus has five teeth on each side of the lower jaw ; but they soon become reduced to two. Amongst the marsupial ani- mals, the genus Tarsipcs is remarkable for the paucity as well as minuteness of its teeth. The elephant has never more than one entire molar, or parts of two, in use on each side of the upper and lower jaws ; to which are added two tusks, more or less developed, in the upper jaw. Some Rodents, as the Australian Water- rats (Hydromys), have two grinders on each side of both jaws; which, added to the four cutting teeth in front, make twelve in all : the common number of teeth in this order is twenty ; but the hares and rabbits have twenty- eight teeth. The sloth has eighteen teeth. The number of teeth, thirty-two, which cha- racterises man, the apes of the old world, and the true ruminants, is the average one of the class Mammalia ; but the typical number is forty-four. The examples of excessive number of teeth are presented, in the order Bruta, by the Priodont Armadillo, which has ninety-eight teeth ; and, in the cetaceous order, by the Cachalot, which has upwards of sixty teeth, though most of them are confined to the lower jaw ; by the common porpoise, which has between eighty and ninety teeth ; by the * Odontography, pi. 87 a,_fit/s. 1—G. t lb. pi. 7ii,Ji(js. 4. G; art. Cetacea, Vol. I. p. 572, fig. 259 b. Gangetic dolphin, which has one hundred and twenty teeth ; and by the true dolphins (Delphinus), which have from one hundred to one hundred and ninety teeth, yielding the maximum number in the class Mammalia. Form.—Where the teeth are in excessive number, as in the species above cited, they are small, equal, or subequal, and of a simple conical form ; pointed, and slightly recurved in the common dolphin ; with a broad and flattened base in the gangetic dolphin (Inia); with the crown compressed, and broadest in the porpoise ; compressed but truncate, and equal with the fang, in the Priodon. The compressed triangular teeth become coarsely notched or dentated, at the hinder part of the series, in the great extinct cetaceous Zeu- glodon. The simple dentition of the smaller Armadillos, of the Orycterope, and of the three-toed Sloth, presents a difference in the size, but little variety in the shape of the teeth, which are subcylindrical, with broad triturating surfaces ; in the two-toed Sloth, the two anterior teeth of the upper jaw are longer and larger than the rest, and adapted for piercing and tearing. In almost all the other Mammalia, particular teeth have special forms for special uses : thus, the front teeth, from being commonly adapted to effect the first coarse division of the food, have been called cutters or incisors ; and the back teeth, which complete its com- minution, grinders or molars; large conical teeth, situated behind the incisors, and adapted by being nearer the insertion of the biting muscles, to act with greater force, are called holders, tearers, laniaries, or more commonly canine teeth, from being well developed in the dog and other Carnivora, although they are given, likewise, to many vegetable feeders for defence or combat: e.g. Musk-deer (Jig. 580, VII.). Molar teeth, which are adapted for mastication, have either tuberculate, or ridged, or flat, summits ; and usually are either sur- rounded by a fence of enamel, or are tra- versed by enamel plates arranged in various patterns. Certain molars in the Dugong, the Mylodon, and the Zeuglodon, are so deeply indented laterally by opposite longi- tudinal grooves, as to appear, when abraded, to be composed of two cylindrical teeth ce- mented together, and the transverse section of the crown is bilobed. The teeth of the Glyptodon were fluted by two analogous grooves on each side. The large molars of the Capybara and Elephant have the crown cleft into a numerous series of compressed transverse plates, cemented together side by side. The teeth of the Mammalia have usually so much more definite and complex a form than those of fishes and reptiles, that three parts are recognised in them : viz. the " fang," the "neck," and the "crown." The fang or root (radix) is the inserted part ; the crown (corona) the exposed part; and the construe tion which divides these is called the neck (cervix). The term " fang " is properly given only to the implanted part of a tooth of re-TEETH. 899 3 M 2 striated growth, which fang gradually tapers to its extremity ; those teeth which grow un- interruptedly have not their exposed part se- parated by a neck from their implanted part, and this generally maintains to its extremity the same shape and size as the exposed crown, It is peculiar to the class Mammalia to have teeth implanted in sockets by two or more fangs ; but this can only happen to teeth of limited growth, and generally characterises the molars and premolars ; perpetually grow- ing teeth require the base to be kept simple and widely excavated for the persistent pulp. In no mammiferous animal does anchylosis of the tooth with the jaw constitute a normal mode of attachment. Each tooth has its particular socket, to which it firmly adheres by the close co-adaptation of their opposed surfaces, and by the firm adhesion of the alveolar periosteum to the organised cement which invests the fang or fangs of the tooth ; but in some of the Cetacea, at the posterior part of the dental series, the sockets are wide and shallow, and the teeth adhere more strongly to the gum than to the periosteum ; in the Cachalot I have seen all the teeth brought away with the ligamentous gum, when it has been stript from the sockets of the lower jaw. Teeth are fixed as a general rule in all Vertebrata, and the only known exceptions are those presented by certain species of fishes, e.g. the Sharks, Lophioids, Gonio- donts. In the higher Vertebrata the move- ments of the teeth depend on those of the jaw-bones to which they are affixed, but appear to be independent in the ratio of the size of the tooth to the bone to which it is attached. Thus the extent of rotatory movement to which the large perforated poison fangs of the rattle-snake are subject depends upon the rotation of the small maxillary bone. So likewise the seemingly individual movements of divarication and approximation observable in the large lower incisors of the Batliyergus and Macropus *, are due entirely to the yielding nature of the symphysis uniting the two rami of the lower jaw in which those incisors are deeply and firmly implanted. It is no more a property of the teeth themselves than is that alternate removal of the lower teeth from, and bringing of them in contact with, the upper teeth of the mouth, which one sees or feels in the act of mastication. True teeth implanted in sockets are con- fined, in the Mammalian class, to the maxil- lary, premaxillary, and mandibular, or lower maxillary bones, and form a single row in each. They may project only from the pre- maxillary bones, as in the Narwhal, or only from the lower maxillary bone, as in Ziphius; or be apparent only in the lower maxillary bone, as in the Cachalot ; or be limited to the superior and inferior maxillaries, and not pre- sent in the premaxillaries, as in the true Pecora, and most Bruta of Linnieus ; in * See Mason Good's Book of Nature, vol. i. p. 285. 182G. general, teeth are situated in all the bones above mentioned. In Man, where the pre- maxillaries early coalesce with the maxillary bones, where the jaws are very short and the crowns of the teeth are of equal length, there is no interspace or "diastema" in the dental series of either jaw, and the teeth derive some additional fixity by their close apposi- tion and mutual pressure. No inferior Mam- mal now presents this character; but its im- portance, as associated with the peculiar attributes of the human organisation, has been somewhat diminished by the discovery of a like contiguous arrangement of the teeth in the jaws of a few extinct quadrupeds : e. g. Anoplotherium, Nesodon, and Dichodon.* The teeth of the Mammalia usually consist of hard unvascular dentine, defended at the crown by an investment of enamel, and every- where surrounded by a coat of cement. The coronal cement is of extreme tenuity in Man, Quadrumana, and terrestrial Carnivora ; it is thicker in the Herbivora, especially in the complex grinders of the Elephant ; and is thickest in the teeth of the Sloths, Mega- therioids, Dugong, Walrus, and Cachalot. Vertical folds of enamel and cement penetrate the crown of the tooth in the Ruminants, and in most Rodents and Pachyderms, charac- terising by their various forms the genera of the last two orders ; but these folds never converge from equidistant points of the cir- cumference of the crown towards its centre. The teeth of the quadrupeds of the order Bruta {Edentata, Cuv.) have no true enamel; this is absent likewise .in the molars of the Dugong and the Cachalot.\ The tusks of the Narwhal, Walrus, Dinotherium, Masto- don, and Elephant consist of modified den- tine, which, in the last two great proboscidian animals, is properly called " ivory," J and is covered by cement. In the subjoined magnified view of a section of the molar of a Megatherium, t is the hard dentine, v the vaso-dentine, and c the cement (^.574). The teeth in the Mammalia, as in the fore- going classes, are formed by superaddition of the hardening salts to pre-existing moulds of animal pulp or membrane, organised so as to insure the arrangement of the earthy particles according to that pattern which characterises each constituent texture of the tooth. The complexity of the primordial basis, or matrix, corresponds, therefore, with that of the fully-formed tooth, and is least remark- able in those conical teeth which consist only * Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, Feb. 1848, p. 36, pi. iv. f M. Fr. Cuvier divides the teeth of Mammalia, according to their composition, into four classes: the first consists of ivory (dentine), enamel, and cement; the second of ivory and enamel; the third of ivory and cement; the fourth of ivory only. (Dents des Mammif eres, p. xxi.) I have met with no Mammalian teeth in which cement is absent, and believe that the second and fourth of the above- cited classes of teeth have no existence in nature.

The primary pulp, of the same form and diameter throughout, which first appears as a papilla rising from the except in the immature animal, when it widens Fig. 574. ree surface of the alveolar gum, is the part of the matrix which by its calcification consti- tutes the dentine; it sinks into a cell and becomes surrounded by a closed capsule in every mammiferous species, at an early stage of the formation of the tooth ; and, as the cement is the result of the ossification of the capsule, every tooth must be covered by a layer of that substance. In those teeth which possess enamel, the mould or pulp of that constituent is developed from the capsule covering the coronal part of the dentinal pulp. In the simple teeth the secondary or enamel pulp covers the crown like a cap ; in the complex teeth it sends processes into depres- sions of the crown, which vary in depth, breadth, direction, and number in the nu- merous groups of the herbivorous and om- nivorous quadrupeds. The dentinal pulp, thus penetrated, offers corresponding com- plications of form ; and as the capsule follows the enamel pulp in all its folds and processes, the external cavities or interspaces of the dentine become occupied by enamel and ce- ment ; the cement, like the capsule which formed it, being the outermost substance, and the enamel being interposed between it and the dentine. The dental matrix presents the most extensive interdigitation of the dentinal and enamel pulps in the Capybara and Ele- phant. The processes of formation and cal- cification of the several constituents of Mam- malian teeth will be found described in the Introduction to my " Odontography " * and in the article Tooth. The matrix of the Mammalian tooth sinks into a furrow and soon becomes inclosed in a cell in the substance of the jaw-bone, from which the crown of the growing tooth extri- cates itself by exciting the absorbent process, whilst the cell is deepened by the same pro- cess and by the growth of the jaw into an alveolus for the root of tne tooth. Where the formative parts of the tootn are repro- duced indefinitely to repair by their progres- sive calcification the waste to which the work- ing surface of the crown of the tooth has been subject, the alveolus is of unusual depth, and * P. xli. to its bottom or base. In teeth of limited growth, the dentinal pulp is reproduced in progressively decreasing quantity after the completion of the exterior wall of the crown, and forms by its calcification one or more roots or fangs, which taper more or less ra- pidly to their free extremity. The alveolus is closely moulded upon the implanted part of the tooth ; and it is worthy of special remark that the complicated form of socket which results from the development of two or more fangs is peculiar to animals of the class Mam- malia.* In the formation of a single fang the ac- tivity of the reproductive process becomes enfeebled at the circumference, and is pro- gressively contracted within narrower limits in relation to a single centre, until it ceases at the completion of the apex of the fang ; which, though for a long time perforated for the admission of the vessels and nerves to the interior of the tooth, is, in many cases, finally closed by the ossification of the remaining part of the capsule. When a tooth is destined to be implanted by two or more fangs, the reproduction of the pulp is restricted to two or more parts of the base of the coronal portion of the pulp, around the centre of which parts the sphere of its reproductive activity is progressively contracted. The intervening parts of the base of the coronal pulp adhere to the cap- sule, which is simultaneously calcified with them, covering those parts of the base of the crown of the tooth with a layer of cement. The ossification of the surrounding jaw being governed by the changes in the soft, but highly organised, dental matrix, fills up the * On the strength of this generalisation, I have established the Mammalian nature of the huge extinct animal called Basilosaurus by Dr. Harlan, and have advocated the claims of the diminutive Ampliitherium and Pliascolotherium of the oolitic slate of Stonesfield to be admitted into the same high class, against the objections raised by M. de Blainville. See " Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. des Sciences," Oct. 22, 1838.

The matrix of certain teeth does not give rise during any period of their formation to the germ of a second tooth, destined to suc- ceed the first ; this, therefore, when com- pleted and worn down, is not replaced: all the true Cetacea are limited to this simple provision of teeth. In the Armadillos, Me- gatherioids, and Sloths, the want of gcrmi- native power, as it may be called, in the matrix is compensated by the persistence of the matrix, and by the uninterrupted growth of the teeth. In most other Mammalia, the matrix of the first developed tooth gives origin to the germ of a second tooth, which sometimes dis- places, sometimes takes its place by the side of, its predecessor and parent. All those teeth which are displaced by their progeny are called temporary, deciduous, or milk teeth ; the mode and direction in which they are displaced and succeeded,— viz., from above downwards in the upper, from below upwards in the lower, jaw ; in both jaws vertically—are the same as in the Crocodile; but the process is never repeated more than once in any mammiferous animal. A con- siderable proportion of the dental series is thus changed; the second, or permanent teeth, having a size and form as suitable to the jaws of the adult, as the displaced tem- porary teeth were adapted to those of the young, animal. The permanent teeth, which assume places not previously occupied by deciduous ones, are always the most poste- rior in their position, and generally the most complex in their form. The successors of the deciduous incisors and canines differ from them chiefly in size ; the successors of the deciduous molars may differ likewise in shape, in which case they have always less complex crowns than their predecessors.* The " bicuspids," in Human Anatomy, and the corresponding teeth, called " pre- molars," in the lower Mammals, illustrate this law. The first true molar owes the germ of its matrix to a vegetation or bud, separated by the fissiparous process from the matrix of the last deciduous tooth; but the backward elongation of the jaw affords space for its development by the side of its progenitor, during which process it may in like manner give origin to a second, and this to a third, molar, succeeding each other from before backwards or horizontally. In this successive germ-production, we find repeated the multiparous property of the dental matrix of the crocodile; but the * " C'est une regie generate, que les molaires de remplacement ont une couronne moins compliquee que celles auxquelles elles succedent; mais cette couronne compliquee se trouve reportee sur les mo- laires permanentes qui viennent plus en arriere." This generalisation was established by Cuvier, in his Lemons d'Anat. Comp., ed. 1805. vol. in. p. 135. concomitant growth of the jaw allows the second, third, and sometimes fourth genera- tion of true molars to co-exist, and come into place side by side. In the Ungniculate, and most of the Ungulate, species of the placental division of the Mammalian class, the fissiparous reproduction of horizontally succeeding teeth stops at the third genera- tion ; in other words, they have not more than three true molars on each side of the upper and lower jaws. In the Marsupial series, the same process extends to a fourth generation of true or horizontally succeeding molars*; and in most of the species, the four true molars are in use and place at the same time; but in certain Kangaroos, the anterior ones are shed before the posterior ones are developed. This successive de- cadence is still more characteristic of the grinding teeth of the Elephant, which are finally reduced to a single molar tooth on each side of both jaws. Thus the class Mammalia, in regard to the times of formation and the succession of the teeth, may be divided into two groups : — the " Hlonop/ii/odonts," f or those that generate a single set of teeth ; and the " Di- phyodonts" % or those that generate two sets of teeth. The Monophyodonts include the orders Monotremata, Brida {Edentata, Cuv.), and Cetacea (Cetacea vera, Cuv.) : all the rest of the order are Diphyodonts. In these, the first set of teeth are called the milk or de- ciduous teeth : the second set, the adult or permanent teeth ; although the teeth of this set are for the most part, like those of the first set, of limited growth, contracting to a root or roots, and being shed in greater or less proportion during the life-time of the species ; which life-time, in wild Carnivora and Herbivora, is dependent on, and would seem, indeed, to be determined by, the dura- tion of the adult teeth. The particulars of the Monophyodont dentition will be found under the Articles Monotremata, Vol. III. p. 387.; Cetacea, Vol. I. pp. 563. 571. 573.; (see my Odonto- graphy, p. 345. pis. 87—91.); and Eden- tata, Vol. II. p. 53.; (see also Odontography, p. 317. pis. 76—86.) Examples of some of the striking modifications of dental structure pre- sented by recent or extinct animals of the order Bruta, are given in Jigs. 548. and 574. of the present article. It will be observed that I have qualified the generalisation as regards the Monophyodont character of the Cetacea, by citing only that part of Cuvier's order which he termed " true or carnivorous Ce- tacea." The animals of the order Sirenia * This characteristic extension of the reproductive power of the matrices of the true molars in the Marsupials, is an approximation to the peculiar activity and persistence of the same power in the vertically succeeding teeth of the cold-blooded Ovi- para, and is associated with many other instances of the same affinity in more important parts of the organization of the implacental Mammals. f tJLmo;, once; tpCu, I generate; oiovs, tooth. j Slf, twice; <pv» and clovs-902 TEETH. (herbivorous Cetacea of Cuvier) differ in has been called in question.* I have, how- many organic particulars from the Cetacea ever, discovered in specimens of the Malayan Dentition of the Dugong (Halicore indicus). Dugong which I have dissected at the Zoological Society, the true deciduous in- cisors of the upper jaw (fig. 575, d i) co- existing with the permanent ones (i). They are much smaller than the permanent tusks of the female, and are loosely inserted by one extremity in conical sockets immediately an- terior to those of the permanent tusks, ad- hering by their opposite ends to the thick tegumentary gum, which presented no out- ward indication of their presence. When this gum was stripped off the bone, the deciduous tusks came away with it; and this may account for their usual absence in dried crania of immature Dugongs, in which, nevertheless, their alveoli are generally suffi- ciently conspicuous. True permanent in- cisors are not developed in the lower jaw of the Dugong ; those which are occasionally found there are abortive remnants of the first or deciduous series, which are not destined at any time to rise above the gum (fig. 575, d i 3.). The molar teeth of the Dugong resemble those of the order Bruta in the total absence of enamel, and of any constriction defining the crown from the fangs. In the Malayan species, only five molars (fig. 575, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) are developed on each side of both jaws : in the Australian Dugong six are developed ; i. e. the Halicore ivdicus is characterised by the molar formula m. -—-=20, whilst the o—5 Halicore australis has m. -—-=24.f But in 6—6 both species, the number is progressively re- duced, by the shedding of the anterior and o 9 smaller molars, to m. -—-=8. The struc- ture of these molar teeth is illustrated in * Dr. Knox, Edinburgh Philosophical Transac- tions, torn. xi. p. 389. t See my appendix to Juke's " Voyage of the Fly.' proper*, and in none, perhaps, more strikingly than in having both deciduous and permanent teeth; this succession takes place, at least, with regard to the upper incisors of the Du- gong, fig. 575. These teeth project from the gum in the male sex; but neither upper nor lower in- cisors are visible in the female.f The supe- rior incisors are but two in number, in both sexes ; in the male, they are moderately long, subtricdral, slightly and equally curved, of the same diameter from the base, and deeply excavated to near the apex, which is obliquely bevelled off to a sharp edge, like the scalpriform teeth of the Rodentia. The form and extent of the persistent pulp-cavity of this tooth are shown in the figure of its longitudinal section, in my " Odontography," pi. 93. fig. 4.; it becomes longer and more pointed than in the permanent incisor of the younger male (fig. 575, i). When fully de- veloped, only the extremity of this tusk pro- jects from the jaw, at least seven-eighths of its extent being lodged in the socket, the parietes of which are entire ; and the exterior of the great premaxillary bones presents an unbroken surface. In the female Dugong, the growth of the permanent incisive tusks of the upper jaw is arrested before they cut the gum, and they remain through life concealed in the premaxillaries; the tusk is solid, is about an inch shorter and less bent than that of the male ; it is also irregularly cylin- drical, longitudinally indented, and it gradually diminishes to an obtuse rugged point ; the base is suddenly expanded, bent obliquely outwards, and presents a shallow excavation. These were conjectured by Home to be the " milk-tusks ; " they are, however, character- istic of sex, not of age ; and the existence of deciduous tusks at any period in the Dugong * Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1838, p. 40. t Proceedings of the Zool.

Owing to there being but one set of molars in the Dugong, those teeth cannot be divided into true and false molars, any more than in the Sloths or Armadillos. In the true Di- pliyodonts, in which each kind of teeth have deciduous predecessors, those grinders which succeed the deciduous ones vertically, and displace them, are called " premolars," or " false molars," and those that come into place behind these, without pushing out vertically any predecessors, are the " molars proper," or " true molars." In this article, as in my " Odontography," the two sorts of grinders are called respectively " premolars " and "molars." In the Marsupial order the normal number of molars is four in each 4 4, dental series, i.e. m. \ in the placental 4-—4 Diphyodonts their normal number is three, 3 3 i. e. m. -—- ; the normal number of prc- 3 3 molars in the Marsupialia is -—but in the Placentalia, it is : in both the numerical 4—4 character of the canines is one, i. e. — -; that 3 3 of the incisors three, i. e. As regards 3—3 the latter teeth, however, the number of exceptions in the Marsupialia is considerable, and the incisors are sometimes in excess; whilst in the placental Diphyodonts, the in- cisors never exceed the typical number, but frequently depart from it by suppression or arrest of development. In fishes and reptiles, certain teeth might be called " incisive," " laniary," or " molar" teeth, in reference to the special adaptation of their form for cutting, tearing, or bruising; but such terms, in the cold-blooded classes, imply no- thing more than those modifications of form; they are not significative of constant and well- defined groups of teeth, and could not become the names of definite parts or organs determin- able and traceable from one species to another. In the Mammalian orders, with two sets of teeth, these organs acquire fixed individual characters, receive special denominations, and can be determined from species to species. This individualisation of the teeth is emi- nently significative of the high grade of organ- isation of the animals manifesting it ; espe- cially when we consider the great proportion of mineral substance which enters into the composition of those parts ; in the number and nature of which the principle of vegetative repetition, and the power of the general polarising forces, have been most controlled in the Mammalia. Originally, indeed, the name " incisors," "laniarics" or "canines," and "molars" were given to the teeth, in Man and certain mammals, as in reptiles, in reference merely to the shape and offices so indicated ; but they are now used as arbitrary signs, in a more fixed and determinate sense. In some Carnivora, e.g., the front teeth have broad tuberculate summits, adapted for nipping and bruising, while the principal back teeth are shaped for cutting, and work upon each other like the blades of scissors. The front teeth in the elephant project from the upper jaw, in the form, size, and direction of long pointed horns. In short, shape and size are the least constant of dental characters in the Mam- malia ; and the homologous teeth are deter- mined, like other parts, by their relative position, by their connections, and by their development. Those teeth which are implanted in the premaxillary bones, and in the corresponding part of the lower jaw, are called " incisors," whatever be their shape or size. The tooth in the maxillary bone, which is situated at, or near to, the suture with the premaxillary, is the " canine," as is also that tooth in the lower jaw which, in opposing it, passes in front of its crown when the mouth is closed. The other teeth of the first set are the " de- ciduous molars ;" the teeth which displace and succeed them vertically are the " pre- molars;" the more posterior teeth, which are not displaced by vertical successors, are the " molars " properly so called. When the premolars and the molars are below their typical number, the absent teeth are missing from the fore-part of the pre- molar series and from the back part of the molar series. The most constant teeth are the fourth premolar and the first true molar ; and, these being known by their order and mode of development, the homologies of the remaining molars and premolars are deter- mined by counting the molars from before backwards, e.g. "one," " two," "three;" and the premolars from behind forwards, e. g. " four," " three," " two," " one." The incisors are counted from the median line, commonly the foremost part of both upper and lower jaws, outwards and backwards. The first in- cisor of the right side is the homotype, trans- versely, of the contiguous incisor of the left side in the same jaw, and, vertically, of its opposing tooth in the opposite jaw ; and so with regard to the canines, premolars, and molars; just as the right arm is the homo- type of the left arm in its own segment, and also of the right leg of a succeeding segment. It suffices, therefore, to reckon and name the teeth of one side of either jaw in a species with the typical number and kinds of teeth ; e.g. the first, second, and third incisors,— the first, second, third, and fourth premolars, — the first, second, and third molars; and of one side of both jaws in any case. The homologous teeth being thus deter- minable, they may be severally signified by a symbol as well as by a name. The incisors, e.g., by their initial letter i., and indivi- dually by an added number, i. 1, i. 2, and i. 3 ; the canines by the letter c.; the pre- molars by the letter p.; and the molars by 3 m 4904 TEETH. the letter m.; these also being differentiated by added numerals. Thus, the number of these teeth, on each side of both jaws, in any given species, Man e.g., may be expressed 2 2 by the following brief formula: — i. > 2—2 ] [ 2 2 3 3 c- yzz\'P- 2^2'm' 3—3=32; an^ t,ie nomo" logies of the individual teeth, in relation to the typical formula, may be signified by i. I., i. 2.; c. ; p. 3., p. 4.; m. 1., m. 2., m. 3.: the suppressed teeth being i. 3.*, p. 1., and p. 2. Examples of the typical dentition are ex- ceptions in the actual creation; but it was the rule in the forms of Mammalia first introduced into this planet; and that, too, whether the teeth were modified for animal or vegetable food. Fig. 576., e. g., shows the dental series The true molars in the one are tuberculate, indicating its tendency to vegetable diet; in the other, they are carnassial, and betoken a peculiarly destructive and bloodthirsty spe- cies.

The premolars in the human subject have been called " bicuspids."

The canines of the Baboons are deeply grooved in front, like the poison-fangs, " denies cana/icula/i," of some serpents. The compressed conical crowns of the molar teeth of the small clawed seals (Stcnor/iynchus') are divided either like a trident, into three sharp points, or like a saw, into four or five points ; the molars of the great extinct Zeuglodon had a similar form ; such teeth have been called dentes serrati. But the philosophical course of the knowledge of nature tends to explode needless terms of art, invented for unimportant vari- eties, and to establish and fix the meaning of those terms that are the signs of determinate species of things. The Cuviers divided the molar series of teeth, according to their form, into three kinds: "false mo- lars," " carnassials," and " tubercu- lar molars ; " and, in giving the ge- neric characters of Mammalia, based the dental formulas on this system : thus the genus Felis is characterised 2 2 as having " fausses molaires ' ° 2—2 1—1, Fig. 580. carnassieres 1 — 1 tuberculeuses 1-1 _ 8„# 0—0' ~~~ 6 The uninterrupted line marked "Cuvier" in V.

Most Zoologists, both at home and abroad, have adopted the Cuvierian system of formalising the molar teeth.

And, perhaps, the close observer might notice that, whilst the upper canine, c, glides behind its homotype be- low, the first upper false molar (p. 2) passes anterior to the crown of the first false molar (p. 3) below; and that the second false molar and carnassial of the upper jaw are also a little in advance of those teeth in the under jaw when the mouth is shut. In passing to the dentition of the Dog (Jig. 580, III.

Cuvier there- fore leaves us to conclude that the tooth which had no homotype or answerable op- ponent above was either the fourth " fausse molaire " below, or else the first. How un- important size and shape are, and how sig- nificant relative position is in the determina- tion of the homologies of teeth as of other parts, may be learnt before quitting the na- tural order of Carnivora ; e. g. by the condi- tion of the dental system in the Bear (Jig. 580, II. Ursus). Here the lower tooth, m. 1, instead of presenting the carnassial character, and resembling in form the upper tooth (p. 4), which is the homologue of the upper car- nassial in the dog, has a tubercular crown, and corresponds in size as well as shape with the upper tooth m. 1, to which it is almost wholly opposed, and with the same slight advance of position which we observe in the lower canine as compared with the upper one, and in the four lower premolars (p>. 1, p. 2, p. 3, p. 4) as com- pared with their veritable homotypes above. F. Cuvier divides the molar series of the cenus Ursus into " fausses molaires ■; r, ° 4—4 1 — 1 . , 2—2 12 „ carnassieres ^, tuberculeuses ^ ^ = j^- The tendency in every thinker to generalise and to recognise Nature's harmonies, has led him here to use the term " carnassiere " in an arbitrary sense, and to apply it to a tooth above (p. 4), which he owns has such a shape and diminished size as would have led him to regard it as merely a false molar, but that the upper carnassial would then have entirely dis- appeared ; and it has also led him to give the name "carnassiere" to a tooth below, m. 1, which he, nevertheless, describes as having a tubercular and not a trenchant crown. In so natural a group as the true Carnivora it was impossible to overlook the homologucs of the trenchant carnassials of the lion, even when they had become tubercular in the omnivo- rous bear ; and Cuvier therefore, having de- termined and defined the teeth so called in the feline genus, felt compelled to distinguish them by the same names after they had lost their specific formal character. And if, indeed, he had succeeded in discovering the teeth w hich were truly answerable or homotypal in the upper and lower jaws, the term " carnassial " might have been retained as an arbitrary one for such teeth, and have been applied to their homologues in Man, the Ruminant, or the Pachyderm, where they are as certainly de- terminable as in those aberrant Carnivores, in which they have equally lost their sectorial shape. But the inconvenience of names in- dicative of such specialties of form will be very obvious when the term " tuberculeuses" comes to be applied to the three hindmost teeth in the Hyanodon {Jig. 577.), which teeth answer to the broad crushing teeth, m. 1, m. 2, and m. 3, in the bear and some other existing Car- nivora. The analogous term " molar," having a less direct or descriptive meaning, is there- fore so much the better as the requisite arbi- trary name of a determinate species of teeth. Had Cuvier been guided in his determina- tions of the teeth by their mutual opposition in the closed mouth, and had studied them with this view in the Carnivora, with the dentition most nearly approaching to the typical formula, viz. the bear, he could then have seen that the three small and inconstant lower premolars (p. 1, p. 2, p. 3) were the homotypes of the three small and similarly inconstant premolars above; that the fourth false molar (p. 4) below, which, as he observes, " alone has the normal form," * was truly the homotype of the tooth above (p. 4), which he found himself com- pelled to reject from the class of " fausses molaires," notwithstanding it presented their normal form; that the tubercular tooth, m. I, which he calls " carnassiere" in the lower jaw, was the veritable homotype of his first " molaire tuberculeuse " above (m. 1), and that the tooth in the inferior series which had no answerable one above was his second '' tuber- * Dents des Maromiferes, p. 111.TEETH. 908 culeuse" (my m. 3), and not any of the four false molars. The true second tuber- cular above (/«. 2) is, however, so much de- veloped in the bear as to oppose both m. 2 and m. 3 in the lower jaw, and it might seem to include the homotypes of both those teeth coalesced. One sees with an interest such as only these homological researches could ex- cite, that they were distinctly developed in the ancient Amplncyon {Jig. 576.), which ac- cordingly presents the typical formula. Thus, I repeat, the study of the relative position of the teeth of the bear might have led to the recognition of their real nature and homolo- gies, and have helped to raise the mask of their extreme formal modifications, by which they are adapted to the habits of the more blood- thirsty Carnivora. But the truth is plainly and satisfactorily revealed when we come to trace the course of development and succes- sion of these teeth. The weight which must ever attach itself to an opinion sanctioned by the authority of both the Cuviers, demands that a conclusion contrary to theirs, and which seems to be opposed by Nature herself in certain instances, should be supported by all the evidence of which such conclusion is susceptible. I proceed, therefore, to show how, in the bear, my determinations of the teeth are es- tablished by their development, as well as by their relative position. As the question only concerns the molar series, the remarks will be confined to these. In the jaws of the young bear, figured in cut 581., the first premolar, p. I, is the only one of the permanent series in place; similarity to p. 4 in the lower jaw (.fig. 581, Ursus), to be veritably the last of the pre- molar series, and to agree not in shape only, but in every essential character, with the three preceding teeth called by Cuvier "fausses molaires." So, likewise, in the lower jaw, we see that the primitive deciduous series, d. 1, d. 2, d. 3, and d. 4, will be displaced by the corresponding premolars,/). I,p. 2,p. 3, and p. 4 ; and that the tooth m. 1, called car- nassiere by Cuvier, in the lower jaw, differs essentially from that p. 4, so called in the upper jaw by being developed without any vertical predecessor or deciduous tooth. The same law of development and succes- sion prevails in the genus Cams {fig. 582.). Although the tooth m. 1 in the lower jaw has exchanged the tubercular for the carnassial form, it is still developed, as in the bear, behind the deciduous series, and indepen- dently of any vertical predecessor; and the tooth p. 4 above, although acquiring a relative superiority of size to its homologue in the bear, and more decidedly a carnassial form, is not the homotype of the permanent carnas- sial below, but of that premolar (p. 4) which is destined to displace the deciduous carnassial d. 4. The symbols sufficiently indicate the relations of the other teeth, and the conclu- sions that are to be drawn from them as to their homologies. It is interesting to observe in the deciduous, as well as in the permanent series, that the lower carnassial d. 4 is not the homotype of the upper one d. 3, but of the tooth which Cuvier calls the " tuberculeuse du lait," d. 4 in the upper jaw. Deciduous and permanent dentition of the Bear (Ursus). the other grinders in use are the deciduous molars, d. 2, d. 3, and d. 4; d. 2 will be displaced by p. 2, d. 3 by p. 3, and (/. 4 by the tooth p. 4, which, notwithstanding its size and shape, Cuvier felt himself compelled to discard from the series of false molars, but which we now see is proved by its developmental relations to d. 4, as well as by its relative position and In the genus Felts {fig. 580.), the small per- manent tubercular molar of the upper jaw, m. 1, has cut the gum before its analogue d. 4 of the deciduous series has been shed ; but though analogous in function, this is not ho- mologous with, or the precedent tooth to m. 1, but, as in the dog, to the great carnassially modified premolar, p. 4.

That the student may test for himself the demonstration which the developmental cha- racters above defined, yield of the true nature and homologies of the feline dentition,— the most modified of all in the terrestrial Carnivora, he is recommended to compare with nature the following details of the appearance and formation of the teeth in the common cat. In this species the deciduous incisors d.i. begin to appear between two anil three weeks old ; the canines d. c. next, and then the molars d. m. follow, the whole being in place before the sixth week. After the seventh month they begin to fall in the same order; but the lower sectorial molar m. 1, and its tubercular homo- type above (m. 1) appear before d. 2, d. 3, and d. 4 fall. The longitudinal grooves are very faintly marked in the deciduous canines. The first deciduous molar (d. 2), in the upper jaw is a very small and simple one-fanged tooth ; it is succeeded by the corresponding tooth of the permanent series, which answers to the second premolar ( /). 2) of the hyasna and dog. The second deciduous molar (d. 3) is the sectorial tooth; its blade is trilobate, but both the anterior and posterior smaller lobes are notched, and the internal tubercle, which is relatively larger than in the permanent sectorial, is continued from the base of the middle lobe, as in the deciduous sectorial of the dog and hyasna; it thus typifies the form of the upper sectorial, which is retained in the permanent dentition of several Viverrine and Musteline species. The third or internal fang of the deciduous sectorial is continued from the inner tubercle, and is opposite the interspace of the two outer fangs. The Musteline type is further adhered to by the young Feline in the large proportional size of its deciduous tubercular tooth, d. 4. In the lower jaw, the first milk- molar (d. 3) is succeeded by a tooth (p. 3) which answers to the third lower premolar in the dog and civet. The deciduous sectorial (d. 4), which is succeeded by the premolar (p. 4), an- swering to the fourth in the dog, has a smaller proportional anterior lobe, and a larger pos- terior talon, which is usually notched ; thereby approaching the form of the permanent lower sectorial tooth in the Mustclidce. In the article Carnivora (vol. i. p. 478.), the remarks on the teeth are limited chiefly to their physiological adaptations. A description of some of their more remarkable structures will here be given, according to the idea of the nature of the teeth above developed. The dental formula of the dog, jackal, wolf, and fox, is illustrated in Jig. 580, III. Canis. * 3Iachairodns, from /^xxcci^a, a sabre; and o5»i?, a tooth. This generic name was imposed by Dr. Kaup on the extinct animal which was armed with canine teeth, like that figured in fig. 580, VI. Such teeth, long, compressed, falciform, sharp- pointed, and with anterior and posterior finely- serrated edges, were first discovered in tertiary strata in Italy and Germany, and were referred by Cuvier to a species of bear, under the name of Ursus cultridens. Fossil canines of this genus have been found in Kent's Hole cave, Torquay. In the Megahtis, or Long-eared Fox (Oto- ci/on, Licht.), the deviation from the typical dentition of the Canidce is effected by excess of development; two additional true molars being present on each side of the upper, and one on each side of the lower jaw, in the permanent series of teeth ; and an approach is made by the modified form of the sectorial molar and of some of the other teeth to the dentition of the Viverridce. This family of Carnivora, which comprehends the Civets, Genets, Ichneumons, Musangs, Surikates, and Mangues, is characterised, with few exceptions, 3 3 j i by the following formula : — i. =—g ; c. ,—~; o—3 I — I 4, 4, 2 2 P- I—I > m' 2~2 : = ^ differs from that of the genus Canis by the absence of a tubercu- lar tooth (in. 3) on each side of the lower jaw ; but, in thus making a rearer step to the typical carnivorous dentition, the Viverridae, on the other hand, recede from it by the less trenchant and more tubercular character of the sectorial teeth, as is shown in the figures of the teeth of the Viverra indica, in my " Odon- tography," pi. 126. figs. 1, 2, and 3. The canines are more feeble, and their crowns are almost smooth; the premolars, however, assume a formidable size and shape in some aquatic species, as those of the sub- genus Cynogale, in which their crowns are large, compressed, triangular, sharp-pointed, with trenchant and serrated edges, like the teeth of certain sharks, (whence the name Sqtududvn, proposed for one of the species), and well adapted to the exigencies of quad- rupeds subsisting principally on fish: the op- posite or obtuse, thick form of the premolars is manifested by some of the Musangs, as Paradoxurus auratus. The upper sectorial tooth, p. 4, is characterised by having its inner tubercle larger, the middle conical division of the blade thicker, and the posterior one smaller than in the genus Canis. This tooth advances to beneath the ant-orbital foramen in the Mu- sangs (Paradoxiiras) : it is situated farther back in the Civets and Genets, in which the blade of the sectorial is sharper. This shows that relative position to the zygomatic or molar process of the maxillary is not a good cha- racter. In the lower jaw the sectorial tooth (m. 1) manifests its true molar character by the pre- sence of an additional pointed lobe on the inner side of the two lobes forming the blade at the fore-part of the crown : the posterior, low, and large lobe of the tooth being also tri-tuberculate, as in the dog. The last molar (m. 2) has an oval crown with four small tubercles, resembling the penultimate lower molar in the clog, with which it corresponds. The deciduous dentition consists, in the 3 3 Viverrine family, of: incisors ; canines J 3—3 ]—1 , 3—3 „ , j j ; molars g g: = 28. If the first per- manent premolar has any predecessor, it must be rudimcntal and disappear early inTEETH 911 both jaws; the second premolar displaces the first normally developed deciduous molar; the third upper premolar displaces and suc- ceeds the deciduous sectorial, which has a sharper and more compressed blade, and a relatively smaller internal tubercle, than the permanent sectorial. This tooth displaces the last deciduous molar, which is a tubercular tooth, resembling in form the first of the two upper permanent tuberculars ; these coming into place without pushing out any prede- cessors, enter into the category of true molar teeth. In the lower jaw the third premolar displaces the deciduous sectorial, which has three trenchant lobes and a relatively smaller posterior talon than the permanent sectorial. The fourth premolar displaces the third or tubercular milk-molar. The permanent sectorial and tubercular molars displace no predecessors, and are therefore m. 1 and m. 2. The first premolar, 1, is net developed at any period in the Mangues (Crossarchus), the Suricates (Eyzcena), or the Mangusta ■paludinosa ; these Viverrines, therefore, retain throughout life more of the immature cha- racters of the family, and in the same degree approach in the numerical characters of their dentition to the more typical Carnivora. The alternate interlocking of the crowns of the teeth of the upper and lower jaws, which is their general relative position in the Carnivora, is well marked in regard to the premolars of the Fiverridee (fig. 580, IV.) : as the lower canine is in front of the upper, so the first lower premolar rises into the space between the upper canine and first upper premolar ; the fourth lower premolar in like manner fills the space between the third upper premolar (p. 3) and the sectorial tooth (p. 4), playing upon the anterior lobe of the blade of that tooth which indicates by its position, as by its mode of succession, that it is the fourth premolar of the upper jaw. The first true molar below, modified as usual in the Car- nivora to form the lower sectorial, sends the three tubercles of its anterior part to fill the space between the sectorial (p. 4) and the first true molar (m. 1) above. In the Mu- sangs the lower sectorial is in more direct opposition to its true homotype, the first tubercular molar in the upper jaw ; and these Indian Vivcrrida: (Paradoxur'i) are the least carnivorous of their family, their chief food consisting of the fruit of palm-trees, whence they have been called " Palm-cats." Hycena.— The dentition of this genus pre- sents a nearer approach to the strictly car- nivorous type by the reduction of the tuber- cular molars to a single minute tooth on each side of the upper jaw, the inferior molars being all conical or sectorial teeth : the molar teeth in both jaws are larger and stronger, and the canines smaller in proportion than in the Feline species, from the formula of which the dentition of the hyasna differs numerically only in the retention of an additional pre- molar tooth, p. 1 above and p. 2 below, on each side of both jaws. The dental formula of the genus Hycena is: — in. -—-, 1—1 4—4 1 — 1 °~ iZTf pvu 3H3' m- tztt : = 3*- Tllc crowns of the incisors form almost a straight tranverse line in both jaws, the exterior ones, above, being much larger than the four middle ones, and extending their long and thick inserted base further back: the crown of the upper and outer incisor (i. 3.) is strong, conical, recurved, like that of a small canine, with an anterior and posterior edge, and a slight ridge along the inner side of the base. The four intermediate small incisors have their crown divided by a trans- verse cleft into a strong anterior, conical lobe, and a posterior ridge, which is notched ver- tically; giving the crown the figure of a trefoil. The lower incisors gradually increase in size from the first to the third ; this and the second have the crown indented ex- ternally ; but they have not the posterior notched ridge like the small upper incisors ; the apex of their conical crown fits into the interspace of the three lobes of the incisor above. The canines have a smooth convex exterior surface, divided by an anterior and posterior edge from a less convex inner side: this surface is almost flat and of less relative- extent in the inferior canines. The first premolar above (p. 1) is very small, with a low, thick, conical crown : the second presents a sudden increase of size, and an addition of a posterior and internal basal ridge to the strong cone. The third premolar exhibits the same form on a still larger scale, and is remarkable for its great strength. The pos- terior part of the cone of each of these premolars is traversed by a longitudinal ridge. The fourth premolar is the carnassial tooth, and has its long blade divided by two notches into three lobes, the first a small thick cone, the second a long and compressed cone, the third a horizontal sinuous trenchant plate : a strong triedral tubercle is developed from the inner side of the base of the anterior part of the crown. The single true molar of the upper jaw (in. l) is a tubercular tooth of small size : transversely oblong in the Hycena vulgaris and H.fusca; smaller and sub-cir- cular in the Hycena crocuta ; still smaller and implanted by a single fang in the Hycena spelcca : in all the existing species of Hyaena it has two fangs. The first premolar of the lower jaw (p. 2) fits into the interspace between the first and second premolars above, and answers, therefore, to the second lower premolar in the Viverridce: it is accordingly much larger than the first (;;. 1) above; it has a ridge in the fore-part of its cone, and a broad basal talon behind. The second (p. 3) is the largest of the lower premolars, has an anterior and a posterior basal ridge, with a vertical ridge ascending upon the fore as well as the back part of the strong rounded cone : the third premolar (p. 4.) is proportion ably less in the Hycena crocuta than in the H. vulgaris: its posterior ridge is developed into a smuli cone; the last tooth (m. \) is the sectorial,TEETH. 912 and consists almost entirely of a blade divided by a vertical fissure into two sub-equal com- pressed pointed lobes: the points are less produced than in the Felines, but the lower sectorial of the hyaena is better distinguished by the small posterior basal talon, from which a ridge is continued along the inner side of the base, and is slightly thickened at the fore-part of the crown. According to the relative po- sition of the crowns of the premolars the third below ought to be the last, being analogous to the fourth in the Viverridce, and the sec- torial should be first true molar : we shall find this view confirmed by the test of the mode of succession of the permanent teeth. But the mode of implantation of the premolar and molar teeth may first be noticed. The first upper premolar has but one fang; the second and third have each two ; the sectorial tooth has three, the two anterior ones on the same tranverse line, the inner one supporting the tubercle. The lower premolars and sectorial have each two fangs, there being none truly answering to the first above : the anterior root of the lower {p. 1) sectorial tooth is very strongly developed in the great extinct Cave-Hyaena. 3 3 The deciduous teeth consist of:—i. g g 1 i 3 3 c. -—-, m. g g, = 28. The figure of the skull of the young Hycena crocuta in the posthumous edition of the " Ossemens Fos- siles," 8vo. 1836, pi. 190, fig. 3, shows that stage when the correspondence with the formula of the genus Felis is completed by the appearance, in the upper jaw, of a small pre- molar in the interspace between the canine and first molar of the deciduous series : but this appearance is due to the apex of the first permanent premolar which cuts the gum before any of the normal deciduous teeth are shed : whether it is preceded, as in the dog, by a deciduous germ-tooth in the foetus, I know not. The first normal deciduous molar is two-fanged, and has a more compressed and consequently more carnivorous crown than that of the second permanent premolar by which it is succeeded. The second deci- duous molar is the sectorial tooth : the inner tubercle is continued from the base of the middle lobe, and thus resembles the permanent sectorial of the Glutton (Gulo) and many other Mustetidce; the deciduous tubercular molar is relatively larger than in the adult Hyana, and offers another feature of resem- blance to the permanent dentition of the Glutton. It is also worthy of remark that the exterior incisor of the upper jaw is not only absolutely, but relatively smaller in the immature than in the adult dentition of the hyaena, and again illustrates the resemblance to the more common type of dentition in the Carnivora. The first and second deciduous molars be- low have more compressed conical crowns than their successors : the third deciduous molar is the sectorial tooth, and, again, as in Gulo, has a better developed hinder tu- bercle than the permanent sectorial; it is not displaced by this tooth, but, as in other Car- nivora, by a premolar of more simple cha- racter. The permanent sectorial is deve- loped posteriorly, and rises, like other true molars, without displacing a deciduous pre- decessor. The permanent dentition of the Hycena, as of other genera or families of the Carnivora, assumes those characteristics which adapt it for the peculiar food and habits of the adult, and mark the deviation from the common type, which always accompanies the progress to maturity. The most characteristic modifi- cation of this dentition is the great size and strength of the molars as compared with the canines, and more especially the thick and strong conical crowns of the second and third premolars in both jaws, the base of the cone being belted by a strong ridge which defends the subjacent gum.* This form of tooth is especially adapted for gnawing and breaking bones, and the whole cranium has its shape modified by the enormous development of the muscles which work the jaws and teeth in this operation.-f- Adapted to obtain its food from the coarser parts of animals which are left by the nobler beasts of prey, the hyaena chiefly seeks the dead carcass, and bears the same relation to the lion which the vulture does to the eagle. In consequence of the quantity of bones which enter into its food, the excrements consist of solid balls of a yellowish white colour, and of a compact earthy fracture. Such specimens of the sub- stance, known in the old Materia Medica by the name of " album graecum," were dis- covered by Dr. Buckland in the celebrated ossiferous cavern at Kirkdale. They were recognised at first sight by the keeper of a menagerie, to whom they were shown, as resembling both in form and appearance the foeces of the spotted Hyaena; and, being analysed by Dr. Wollaston, were found to be composed of the ingredients that might be expected in foecal matter derived from bones, viz. phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, and a very small proportion of the triple phosphate of ammonia and magnesia. This discovery of the coprolites of the hyaena formed, perhaps, the strongest of the links in that chain of evidence by which Dr. Buckland proved that the cave at Kirkdale, in York- shire, had been, during a long succession of years, inhabited as a den by hyaenas, and that they dragged into its recesses the other animal bodies, whose remains, splintered and bearing marks of the teeth of the hyaena, were found mixed indiscriminately with their own. * An eminent civil engineer, to whom I showed the jaw of a hyaena, observed that the strong conical tooth, with its basal ridge, was a perfect model of a hammer for brealdng stones for roads. f " The strength of the hyasna's jaw is such that, in attacking a dog, he begins by biting off his leg at a single snap." Buckland," Eeliquia; Diluvianae," p. 23.TEETH. 9i3 The dentition of the Weasel tribe (Muste- lidce) is illustrated (in/g. 580, IV.) by that of the Otter, Musiela Lutra of Linnaeus, and which is essentially a great aquatic Weasel or 3 3 i i Polecat; its dental formula is i. ^—^, c. -—j, 4, 4, ] ] p. -—-, m. -—g : = 36. In the Martin cats (Mustela monies, L.), the little homotype of p. 1 above is present in the lower jaw ; in the bloodthirsty stoats and weasels, 1 is absent in both jaws ; as it is likewise in the great sea- otter {J£riHydra)r in which also the two middle incisors are wanting in the lower jaw. In this animal the second premolar (p. 3) has a strong obtuse conical crown, double the size of that of p. 2 ; the third premolar (p. 4) is more than twice the size of p. 3, and represents the upper carnassial or sectorial strangely molli- fied; the two lobes of the blade being hemi- spheric tubercles. The last tooth, m. 1, has a larger crown than the sectorial, and is of a similar broad crushing form. In the lower jaw the molar series are not separated by any interspace: the first and second premolars have oblique obtuse conical crowns. The third premolar (p. 4) is more than twice the size of the second (p. 3) and supports a large anterior hemispheric protuberance with a small internal tubercle and a posterior basal ridge. The first true molar has an oblong quadrate crown with an anterior small tubercle, a larger and more prominent inner one, and the rest of the broad horizontal surface un- dulating. The second true molar has a trans- versely elliptical crown depressed in the centre. When the teeth are in apposition, the anterior third of the first true molar below is applied to the inner tubercle of the last premolar above ; the rest of its crown plays upon that of its homotype, the first true molar in the upper jaw, leaving a small part of that tooth to receive the appulse of the second true molar below, which has no corresponding tooth in the upper jaw. The Mustelidee present great constancy in regard to the number of their true molar teeth; with one exception, the Ratel (Melli- vora), in which »/. 2 is absent below, they have one true molar on each side of the upper jaw, and two on each side of the lower jaw; the second of these has always a broad tubercular crown, like the one above. The upper true molar is supported by one inner, and sometimes by one (JPutorius, Gulo), sometimes two (Mustela, Lutra, Melphiiis), outer fangs. The second true molar below is also tubercular, but has a single fang. The crown of the first true molar below offers many gradations from the sectorial type, as manifested in Putorius and Gulo, to the tuber- cular type, as in the Taira, Ratel, and sea- otter. The principal varieties occur, as usual, in the comparatively less important premolars : in the Martins and Gluttons, they are as numerous as in the dog; the first, in both jaws, being implanted by a single fang ; the rest by two, with the exception of VOL. IV. the last above, which has three roots. In the otter, we find the first premolar removed from the lower jaw; and the second (now the first) shows its true homology by its double implantation, as well as by the position of its crown behind the first in the upper jaw (/j. 1). In the Stoats, Skunks, and Ratels, the premolar series is further reduced by the loss of the anterior tooth (p. 1) in both jaws, and by the diminution of the size of p. 2, which thus becomes the first in both jaws, and which is also now implanted by a single fang. In a South American Skunk, the second premolar disappears in the upper jaw, leaving there only the homologues of the third and fourth of the typical formula, /;. 4 being always the sectorial in the Mustelidee, as in other terrestrial Carnivora. This tooth, under all its modifications, retains the blade with the lobe, corresponding to the middle one in the feline sectorial, generally well developed and sharp-pointed ; the differences are principally manifested by the proportions of the inner tubercle, and the relative size of the third root supporting it. But the upper sectorial, being a premolar, and therefore requiring less modification of the crown to adapt it for its special functions, manifests a more limited extent of variety than the lower sectorial, which, being a true molar, requires greater modification of the typical form of its crown to fit it for playing upon the sectorial blade of p. 4 above. Melidce.-~-ln this sub-family I comprise the European Badger (Meles), the Indian Badger (Arctont/x}, and the American Badger (Taxidca) ; which, with respect to their den- tition, stand at the opposite extreme of the Mustelid(B to that occupied by the predaceous Weasel, and manifest the most tuberculate and omnivorous character of the teeth. The , . . 3—3 1—1 3—3 lormula is: — i. ^—c. • r ; p. -.—-. : 3—3 * 4—4 1—1 m. : = 30. The canines are strongly developed, well pointed, with a posterior trenchant edge ; they are more compressed in Avctonyx than in Meles. The first lower premolar {p. 1) is very small, single-fanged, and, generally, soon lost. The first above, corresponding with the second in the dog, is also small, and implanted by two connate fangs. The second upper premolar (p. 3) has a larger, but simple, sub-compressed conical crown, and is implanted by two fangs: the third (p. 4) re- peats the form of the second on a larger scale, with a better developed posterior talon, and with the addition of a tri-tuberculate low flat lobe, which is supported by a third fang : the outer pointed and more produced part of this tooth represents the blade of the sectorial tooth and the entire crown of the antecedent premolars. The true molar in Meles (m. ]) is of enormous size compared with that of any of the preceding Carnivora: it has three external tubercles, and an extensive horizontal surface traversed longitudinally by a low 3jsTEETH. 914 ridge, and bounded by an internal belt, the cingulum of Illiger: this tooth has a similarly shaped, but relatively smaller, crown in Arc- tonyx* The second premolar below (p. 2) is commonly the first, through the early loss of the minute one in front ; its fangs are usually connate, as in its homotype above. The third and fourth premolars slightly in- crease in size, have simple compressed conical crowns, and two fangs each. The first true molar below (m. 1) now retains little of its sectorial character, the blade being represented only by the two anterior small, compressed pointed lobes; behind these, the crown ex- pands into an oval grinding surface, narrower in Arctonyx than in Meles, supporting three tubercles and a posterior tuberculate ridge: it has generally two principal roots and a small intermediate accessory fang, as in the otter. The second molar (m. 2), which ter- minates the series below, is of small size, and has a rounded flat crown, depressed in the centre, and with two small external tubercles; its two short fangs are connate. In the Labrador Badger, the last premolar has a larger relative size, the part corresponding with the blade of the sectorial, is sharper and more produced, and the internal tu- bercle has two lobes; the succeeding molar tooth is reduced in size, and its crown pre- sents a triangular form. The first true molar below has its sectorial lobes better developed : these differences give the North American badgers a more carnivorous character than is manifested by the Indian or European species. Sub-UrsidcB.—In other allied genera, which, like the badgers, have been grouped, on ac- count of the plantigrade structure of their feet, with the bears, a progressive approxi- mation is made to the type of the dentition of the Ursine species. The first true molar below soon loses all its sectorial mollification, and acquires its true tubercular character: and the last premolar above becomes more directly and completely opposed to its homo- type in the lower jaw. The Racoon (Procyon f) and the Coati (Nasua) present good examples of these transitional modifications ; they have the complete number of premolar teeth, the 3—3 1 — 1 4—4 dental formula being, i. c- P' 4=4' m. 2 2 : = 40. The development of the in- ner part of the crown of the last upper pre- molar, which constitutes the tubercle of the sectorial tooth, now produces two tubercles on a level with the outer ones which represent the blade; and the opposite premolar below (p. 4), which is the true homotype of the modified sectorial above, begins to acquire a marked increase of breadth and accessory basal tu- bercles. All the lower premolars, as well as the true molars, have two fangs; the three first premolars above have two fangs, the fourth has three, like the two true molars above.

In the family of true seals, the incisive formula is further re- duced, in some species even to zero in the 3 3 lower jaw, and it never exceeds ^. All the Phocidce possess powerful canines ; only in the aberrant walrus {Trichechus) are theyabscnt in the lower jaw, but this is compensated by the singular excess of development which they manifest in the upper jaw. In the pinnigrade, as in the plantigrade, family of Carnivores we find the teeth which correspond to true mo- lars more numerous than in the digitigrade species, and even occasionally rising to the typical number, three on each side ; but this, in the seals, is manifested in the upper and not, as in the bears, in the lower jaw. The entire molar series usually includes five, rarely six teeth on each s'de of the upper jaw, and five on each side of the lower jaw, with crowns, which vary little in size or form in the same individual ; they are supported in some genera, as the Eared Seals (Otarice) and Elephant Seals (Cystojihora*), by a single fang; in other genera f by two fangs, which are usually connate in the first or second teeth ; the fang or fangs of both incisors, canines and molars, are always remarkable for their thickness, which commonly sur- passes the longest diameter of the crown. The crowns are most commonly compressed, conical, more or less pointed, with the " cin- gulum " and the anterior and posterior basal tubercles more or less developed; in a few of the largest species they are simple and ob- tuse, and particularly so in the walrus, in which the molar teeth are reduced to a smaller number than in the true seals.J In these the line of demarcation between the true and false molars is very indefinitely in- dicated by characters of form or position ; but, according to the instances in which a deciduous dentition has been observed, the first three permanent molars in both jaws succeed and displace the same number of milk molars, and are consequently premolars ; occasionally, in the seals with two-rooted molars, the more simple character of the premolar teeth is manifested by their fangs being connate, and in the Stenorhynchus serri- dens the more complex character of the true molars is manifested in the crown. There is no special modification of the crown of any tooth by which it can merit the name of a * Odontography, pi. 132, fig. 7. f lb. figs. 1—4. j The relation of Trichechus to the Phocidce is analogous to that of Machairodus to the Felida; and also, in the simplification of the molars, to that of Proteles to Canidce.915 TEETH. 3 N 2 "sectorial" or " earnassial; " but we may point with certainty to the third molar above and the fourth below as answering to those teeth which manifest the sectorial character in the terrestrial Carnivora. The coadaptation of the crowns of the upper and lower teeth is more completely alternate than in any of the terrestrial Car- nivora, the lower tooth always passing into the interspace anterior to its fellow in the upper jaw. In the genus Plwca proper (Ca- locephalus, Cuv.) typified by the common seal 3 3 {Ph. vilulina), the dental formula is, i. -— 1 i 3 3 9 2 c- fZ-i' P- 3Z^j> m- : = 341- Tlle forms and proportions of these teeth are shown in PI. 132, Jig. 1., of my "Odontography," The first tooth above and below presents a complete confluence of the fangs; they are separated from the second above ; but be- low they sometimes do not become free before the fourth, and sometimes the two roots are distinct in the third and second molars. In the P/ioca anettata Mills., the principal cusp of the molar teeth is com- plicated with anterior and posterior smaller cusps, sometimes one in number in the upper molars ; the anterior accessory cusp is some- times wanting in the first, and is rudimentary in the rest; but usually there are two small cusps behind the principal one, and in the three or four posterior molars in the lower jaw there are sometimes two small cusps be- fore and two behind the principal one.* In the Phoca caspica the upper molars have commonly one accessory cusp before and one behind the principal lobe; the lower molars have one accessory cusp before and two be- hind. In the Phoca grmnlandica the upper molars have no anterior basal cusp and only one be- hind ; the lower molars have two cusps behind and one in front, except the first, which re- sembles that above, and, like it, has connate fangs. The condition of the molar teeth is nearly the same in the Phoca barbata, but the crowns are rather thicker and stronger, and the three middle ones above have two posterior basal cusps feebly indicated, the same being more strongly marked in the four last molars below. The following genera of seals with double- rooted molars (Pelagius and Stenorhynchus) have four incisors above as well as below, i. c. 2 2 -—-. An upper view of the molar teeth in the Hooded Seal of the Mediterranean (Pc/a- gius monachus) is given in my Odontography, PI, 132. Jig. 3., as when they are worn down in an old specimen ; the crowns are thick, obtuse, sub-compressed, with a well developed * Nillson, in Wiegmann's Archiv. 1841, 313. I notice these varieties of the crown, in connection with analogous ones in the fang's of the teeth of the same species, to show the inadequacy of such cha- racters as marks of subgeneric distinction. cingulurii, a principal lobe and an anterior and posterior accessory basal lobule ; the fangs are connate in the first tooth both above and below. The allied sub-genus (Ommatopkoca) of seals of the southern hemisphere has six molar teeth on each side of the upper, and five on each side of the lower jaw, with the principal lobe of the crown more incurved. The two first molars above are closely approximated, but this may prove to be a variety. In the Stenorhynchus the jaws are more slender and produced, and the molar teeth are remarkable for the long and slender shape of the principal lobe, and of the accessory basal cusps. The incisors have sharp conical re- curved crowns, like the canines, and the ex- ternal ones in the upper jaw are intermediate in size between the canines and the middle in- cisors. In the Stenorhynchus leptonyx each molar tooth in both jaws is trilobed, the anterior and posterior accessory curving towards the principal one, which is bent slightly back- wards ; all the divisions are sharp-pointed, and the crown of each molar thus resembles the trident or fishing-spear ; the two fangs of the first molar in both jaws are connate. In Stenorhynchus serrideiis the three anterior mo- lars on each side of both jaws are four-lohed, there being one anterior and two posterior accessory lobes ; the remaining posterior molars (true molars) are five-lobed, the prin- cipal cusp having one small lobe in front, and three developed from its posterior margin; the summits of the lobes are obtuse, and the posterior ones are recurved like the prin- cipal lobe. Sometimes the third molar be- low has three instead of two posterior acces- sory lobes. Occasionally, also, the second, as well as the first molar above, has it fangs con- nate ; but the essentially duplex nature of the seemingly single fang, which is unfailingly manifested within by the double pulp-cavity, is always outwardly indicated by the median longitudinal opposite indentations of the im- planted base. These slight and unessential varieties, presented by the specimens of the Saw-toothed Sterrink {Stenorhynchus serridens) brought home by the enterprising Naturalist of Sir J. Ross's Antarctic expedition, accord with the analogous varieties noticed by the best observers of the seals of our neighbour- ing seas, as, for example, Nillson. The Grey Seal {Halichcerus gryphus) of our own seas begins, by the extension of the connate condition of the two roots through a greater proportion of the molar series, to manifest a transition to the family of seals with true single-rooted molars ; the formula of this genus is. i. 3 3 c ■ -, P. 3~3 2—2' 1—1^ 3—3 2—2 m- : = 3*- T"e f°ur noddle upper in- cisors are close set, with pointed recurved crowns ; the lateral ones are much larger and laniariform : the canines have moderate crowns, with a sharp ridge before and behind. The916 TEETH. crowns of the molar teeth arc conical, sub- compressed longitudinally and finely grooved, with an anterior and posterior edge ; those below have generally a slight notch at the fore and back part of the base. The first molars, both above and below, are the smallest, with a simple crown and a single ventricose fang ; the second and third above, and the second, third, and fourth below, have two connate roots ; the two roots are commonly distinct in the remaining posterior molars : all the roots are very thick. In the genus Otaria the dental formula is, ■ 3—3 1—1 3—3 3—3 „„ rp, 2. , c. , p. , m. — 36. The 2—2' 1—1 1 3—3 2—2 two middle upper incisors are small, sub-com- pressed, with the crown transversely notched ; the simple crowns of the four incisors below fit into these notches : the outer incisors above are much larger, with a long pointed conical crown, like a small canine. The true canine is twice as large as the adjoining incisor, and is rather less recurved. The molars have each a single fang ; the crown is conical, sub- compressed, pointed ; in the two last recurved, with a basal ridge or " cingulum," broadest within : but, in the Otaria jubata, the molars have a pointed cusp developed from the fore- part, and in the last two molars also from the back part of the crown. In some species, as the Otaria lobata (Phoca lubata, Fischer), the 6ingle molar is not developed in the upper jaw, and the outer incisors above are not so large : in this species a thick plicated cingulum belts the base of each molar and developes a small tu- bercle from its fore-part in the molars of the lower jaw ; the crown of the last molar above is notched. In the great proboscidian and hooded Seals (Cystopkora), the incisors and canines still more predominate in size over the molars ; but the incisors are reduced in number, the formula here is; i. ^ ^ c. ^ ^, p. 2 2 m. -—-: = 30. All the molars are single- rooted, and all the incisors are laniariform. The two middle incisors above and the two below are nearly equal ; the outer incisors above are larger. The canines are still more formidable, especially in the males ; the curved root is thick anil subquadrate. The crowns of the molar teeth are short, sub-compressed, obtuse; sometimes terminated by a knob and defined by a constriction or neck from the fanir ; the last is the smallest. In the Walrus (Tric/iechus rosmarus), the normal incisive formula is transitorily re- presented in the very young animal, which lias three teeth in each intermaxillary hone ami two on each side of the fore-part of the lower jaw ; they soon disappear, except the outer pair above, which remain close to the intermaxillary suture, on the inner side of the sockets of the enormous canines, and seem to commence the series of small and simple molars which they resemble in size and form. In the adult there are usually three molars or premolars on each side above, behind the per- manent incisor, and four similar teeth on each side of the lower jaw ; the anterior one passing into the interspace between the upper incisor and the first molar, and therefore being the homotype of the molar. In a young walrus's skull with canine tusks eight inches long, I have seen a fourth upper molar, (fifth includ- ing the incisor), of very small size, about a line in breadth, lodged in a shallow fossa of the jaw, behind the three persistent molars. The crowns of these teeth must be almost on a level with the gums in the recent head; they are very obtuse and worn obliquely from above clown to the inner border of their base. The molars of the lower jaw are rather narrower from side to side than those above, and are convex or worn upon their outer side. Each molar has a short, thick, simple and solid root. The canines are developed only in the upper jaw, but are of enormous size, de- scending and projecting from the mouth, like tusks, slightly inclined outwards and bent backwards; they present an oval transverse section, with a shallow longitudinal groove along the inner side, and one or two narrower longitudinal impressions upon the outer side; the base of the canine is widely open, its growth being uninterrupted. The food of the walrus consists of sea- weed and bivalves ; the molars are well adapted to break and crush shells ; and fragments of a species of Mya have been found, with pounded sea-weed, in the stomach. The canine tusks serve as weapons of offence and defence, and to aid the animal in mounting and clambering over blocks of ice. For their composition and microscopic structure I must refer to my " Odontography," p. 511, et seq. The precise determination of the teeth in the walrus and some other kinds of seals, still awaits the opportunity of examining very young specimens with the deciduous series, which is very early lost. When the clew is afforded by the opportunity of studying the development and succession of the teeth, it infallibly conducts us to the true knowledge of the nature, both of the teeth which are retained, and of those that are wanting to complete the typical number. We have availed ourselves of this in deciphering the much modified dentition of the genus Felis ; and the same clew will guide us to a similar satisfactory knowledge of the nature and homologies of the teeth in the human species. The discovery, by the great poet Oothe, of the limits of the premaxillary bone in man leads to the determination of the incisors, which are reduced to two on each side of both jaws: the contiguous tooth shows by its shape, as well as position, that it is the canine, and the characters of size and shape have also served to divide the remaining five, teeth in each lateral series into two bicuspids and three molars. In this instance, as in the dentition of the bear, the secondary characters conform with the essential ones. But since we have seen of how little value shape or size are, in the order Carnivora, in the deter-TEETH. 917 3 N 3 initiation of the exact homologies of the teeth, it is satisfactory to know that the more constant and important character of develop- ment gives the requisite certitude as to the nature of the so-called bicuspids in the human subject. In fig. 584., the condition of the Fig. 584. Deciduous and permanent teeth of a Child (Homo). teeth is shown in the jaws of a child of about six years of age. The two incisors on each side (di.) are followed by a canine, dc, ami this by three teeth having crowns resembling those of the three molar teeth of the adult. In fact, the last of the three is the first of the permanent molars ; it has pushed through the gum, like the two molars which are in advance of it, without displacing any previous tooth, and the substance of the jaw contains no germ of any tooth destined to displace it : it is therefore, by this character of its de- velopment, a true molar, and the germs of the permanent teeth, which are exposed in the substance of the jaw between the diverging fangs of the molars, (/. 3 and d. 4, prove those molars to bo temporary, destined to be replaced, and prove also that the teeth about to displace them are premolars. According, therefore, to the rule previously laid down, we count the permanent molar in place the first of its series (m. 1), and the adjoining premolar as the last of its series, and consequently the fourth of the typical dentition, or p. 4. We are thus enabled, with the same scien- tific certainty as that whereby we recognise in the middle toe of the foot the homoloiiue of that great digit which forms the whole foot and is encased by the hoof in the horse, to point to 4, or the second bicuspid in the upper jaw, and to m. 1, or the first molar in the lower jaw of man, as the homo- logues of the great carnassial teeth of the lion and tiger. We also conclude that the teeth which are wanting in man to complete the typical molar series, are the first and second premolars, the homologues of those marked p. 1 and p. 2 in the bear. The characteristic shortening of the maxillary bones required this diminution of the number of their teeth, as well as of their size, and of the canines more especially ; and the still greater curtailment of the premaxillary bone is attended with a diminished number and an altered position of the incisors. One sees, indeed, in the car- nivorous series, that a corresponding decrease in the number of the premolars is concomitant with the shortening of the jaws. Already in the Muste/idce, (fig. 580., IV), p. 1 below is abrogated; in JFV/walso above, with the further loss of;;. 2 in the lower jaw ; the true molars being correspondingly reduced in these strictly flesh-eating animals, but taken away from the back part of iheir series. If we were desirous of further testing the soundness of the foregoing conclusions as to the nature of the teeth absent in the reduced dental formula of man, we ought to trace the mode in which the type is progressively resumed in descending from man through the order most nearly allied to our own. Through a considerable part of the Qua- drumanous series, e. g. in all the Old World genera above the Lemurs, the same number and kinds of teeth are present as in man ; the first deviation being the disproportionate size of the canines and the concomitant break or "diastema" in the dental series for the reception of their crowns when the mouth is shut. This is manifested in both the Chimpanzees and Orangs, together with a sexual difference in the proportions of the canine teeth. As the precise characteristics of the human dentition are best demonstrated by comparison with that brute species which is most nearly allied to Man, and makes the first step in the descending scale, I here subjoin the details of such a comparison, which is the more required since it is not touched upon in the article Qua drum an a, and will be the more acceptable as one of its subjects is a species of Chim- panzee (Troglodytes Gorilla) *, unknown to science when that article was written, and which, so far as its organisation is known, is more anthropoid than even the docile and smaller species of Chimpanzee (Troglodytes nigcr). A side view of the teeth of a male, full-grown, but not aged, specimen of the great Chimpanzee is given of the natural size in fig. 585., and a view of the working surface of the whole series of the upper jaw in fig. 586. This dentition, though in all its principal characters strictly quadrumanous, yet, in the * Drs. Savage and Wyman, Boston Journal of Natural History, 1847; Owen, Transactions of the Zoological Society, vol. iii. p. 381 (February, 1848). M. F. Cuvier has not given a figure of the dentition of any species of Chimpanzee (Troglodytes). Be- lieving with his brother, that the Orang (Pithecus, Geoffr.) made the nearest approach to man, the dentition of an immature Pithecus Wurmbii with one of the characteristically large permanent molars (m. 1) in place, immediately follows the plate of the human dentition in the " Dents des Mammiferes," 8vo. pis. i. & ii.918 TEETH.

In the upper jaw the middle incisors (jig. 586, I 1) are smaller, the lateral ones (ib. i. 2 ) larger than those of the Orang *; they are thus more nearly equal to each other; nevertheless the proportional superiority of the middle pair is much greater than in Man, and the proportional size of the four incisors both to the entire skull and to the other teeth is greater. Each incisor has a prominent posterior basal ridge, and the outer angle of the lateral incisors, i. 2, is rounded off as in the Orang. The incisors incline forwards from the vertical line as much as in the great Orang. Thus the characteristics of the human incisors are, in addition to their true incisive wedge-like form, their near equality teeth " *, when the mouth is closed, is appli- cable only to the female, and does not distin- guish the Chimpanzees from the Orangs. In the male of the smaller Chimpanzee {Troglody- tes niger) the upper canine is conical, pointed, but more compressed than in the Orang, and with a sharper posterior edge ; convex ante- riorly, becoming natter at the posterior half of the outer surface, and concave on the corre- sponding part of the inner surface, which is traversed by a shallow longitudinal impres- sion ; a feeble longitudinal rising and a second linear impression divide this from the convex anterior surface, which also bears a longitu- dinal groove at the base of the crown. The canine is rather more than twice the size of that in the female. In the male Gorilla {figs. 585, 586.), the crown of the canine is Fis. 587.

The diastema be- tween the incisors and the canine on each side is as well marked in the male Chim- panzee as in the male Orang.f The crown of the canine (ib. <\), passing outside the in- terspace between the lower canine and pre- molar, extends in the male Troglodytes Gorilla a little below the alveolar border of the under jaw when the mouth is shut ; the upper ca- nine of the male Troglodytes niger likewise projects a little below that border ; the seventh character, therefore, which I had formerly assigned to the genus, " apices of canines lodged in intervals of the opposite * Compare fig. 586. with pi. xxxii. {Pithceus Wurmbil) ami pi. xxxiv. {Pith.

Both premolars {fig. 586. p. 3 and p. 4) are bicuspid ; the outer cusp of the first and the inner cusp of the second being the largest, and the first premolar consequently appearing the largest on an external view {fig. 585.). The difference is well marked in the female (Jig. 587, p. 3, p. 4). The anterior ex- ternal angle of the first premolar is not pro- duced as in the Orang, which in this respect makes a marked approach to the lower Qua- drumana. In Man, where the outer curve of the premolar part of the dental series is greater than the inner one, the outer cusps of both premolars are the largest ; the alternating su- periority of size in the Chimpanzee accords * Zool. Trans, vol. i. p. 372.TEETH. 920 with, and contributes to, the straight line which the canine and premolars form with the true molars. Thetruemolars (_/%.586.,in. l,jn.2,m.3)are quadricuspid, relatively larger in comparison with the bicuspids than in the Orang. In the first and second molars of both species of Chimpanzee a low ridge connects the antero- internal with the postero-external cusp, cross- ing the crown obliquely, as in Man. There is a feeble indication of the same ridge in the unworn molars of the Orang ; but the four principal cusps are much less distinct, and the whole grinding surface is flatter and more wrinkled than in the Chimpanzee. In the Troglodytes niger the last molar is the smallest, owing to the inferior development of the two hinder cusps, and the oblique connecting ridge is feebly marked. In the Troglodytes Gorilla this ridge is as well developed as in the other molars, but is more transverse in position ; and the crown of m. 3 is equal in size to that of m. 1 or m. 2, having the pos- terior outer cusp, and particularly the pos- terior inner cusp, more distinctly developed than in the Troglodytes niger. The repe- tition of the strong sigmoid curves which the unworn prominences of the first and se- cond true molars present in Man, is a very significant indication of the near affinity of the Chimpanzee as compared with the ap- proach made by the Orangs or any of the inferior Quadrumana, in which the four cusps of the true molars rise distinct and indepen- dently of each other. A low ridge girts the base of the antero-internal cusp of each of the upper true molars in the male Chimpan- zee: it is less marked in the female. The premolars as well as molars are severally im- planted by one internal and two external fangs, diverging but curving towards each other at their ends as if grasping the substance of the jaw. I have found the two outer fangs of the second premolar connate in one female specimen of the Troglodytes niger. In no variety of the human species are the premo- lars normally implanted by three fangs ; at most the root is bifid, and the outer and inner divisions of the root are commonly connate. It is only in the black varieties, and more particularly that race inhabiting Australia, that I have found the wisdom tooth, m. 3, with three fangs as a general rule ; and the two outer ones are more or less confluent. In the lower jaw of the great Chimpanzee the lateral incisors are broader than the middle ones, although they are smaller rela- tively than in the Troglodytes niger; they are larger and less vertically implanted than in Man. The lower canines are two inches and a half in length, including the root ; the enamelled crown is an inch and a quarter in length, and nearly an inch across the base; it is conical and trihedral ; the outer and ante- rior surface is convex, the other two surfaces are flattened or subconcave, and converging to an almost trenchant edge directed inwards and backwards; a ridge separates the convex from the antero-internal flat surface; both this and the posterior surface show slight traces of a longitudinal rising at their middle part. The lower canine of the male shows the same relative superiority of size as the upper one compared with that in the female in both species of Chimpanzee. The canine almost touches the incisor, but is separated by a diastema one line and a half broad from the first premolar. This tooth (p. 3) is larger externally than the second premolar, and is three times the size of the human first premolar (p. 3); it has a subtrihedral crown, with the anterior and outer angle produced forwards, slightly indicating the peculiar fea- ture of the same tooth in the Baboons, but in a less degree than in the Orang. The summit of the crown of p. 3 terminates in two sharp trihedral cusps, the outer one rising highest, and the second cusp being feebly indicated on the ridge extending from the inner side of the first ; the crown has, also, a thick ridue at the inner and posterior part of its base. The second premolar (p. 4) has a subquad- rate crown, with the two cusps developed from its anterior half, and a third smaller one from the inner angle of the posterior ridge. Each lower premolar is implanted by two antero-posteriorly compressed divergent fangs, one in front of the other, the anterior fang being the largest. The three true molars are equal in size in the Troglodytes Gorilla ; in the Troglodytes niger (Jig. 588.) the first (in. 1) is a little larger than the last (m, 3), which is the Fie. 588. ■Dental series, lower jaw, adult male, Troglodytes niger.

The four principal cusps, especially the two inner ones, of the first molar of both species of Chimpanzee are more pointed and prolonged than in Man ; a fifth small cusp is developed behind the outer pair, as in the Orangs and the Gibbons, but is less than that in Man. The same additional cusp is present in the second molar, which is seldom seen in Man. The crucial groove on the grinding surface is much less distinct than in Man, not being continued across the ridge connecting the anterior pair of cusps in the Chimpanzee. The crown of the third molar is longer antero-posteriorly from the greater development of the fifth posterior cusp, which, however, is rudimental in comparison with that in the Semnopitheques and Macaques. All the three true molars are supported by two distinct and well developed antero-pos- teriorly compressed divergent fangs, longitu- dinally excavated on the sides turned towards each other ; in the white ami yellow races of the human subject these fangs are usually connate in m. 3, and sometimes also in in. 2. The molar series in both species of Chim- panzee forms a straight line, with a slight ten- dency in the upper jaw to bend in the opposite direction to the well-marked curve which the same series describes in the human subject. This difference of arrangement, with the more complex implantation of the premolars, the proportionally larger size of the incisors as compared with the molars ; the still greater relative magnitude of the canines ; and, above all, the sexual distinction in that respect, illus- trated by Jigs. 585. 587., stamp the Chimpan- zees most decisively with not merely specific but generic distinctive characters as compared with Man. For the teeth are fashioned in their shape and proportions in the dark re- cesses of their closed formative alveoli, and do not come into the sphere of operation of external modifying causes until the full size of the crowns has been acquired. The formid- able natural weapons, with which the Creator has armed the powerful males of both species of Chimpanzee, form the compensation for the want of that psychical capacity to forge destructive instruments which has been re- served as the exclusive prerogative of Man. Both Chimpanzees and Orangs differ from the human subject in the order of the de- velopment of the permanent series of teeth ; the second molar (»;. 2) comes into place before either of the premolars has cut the gum, and the last molar (tn. 3) is acquired before the canine. We may well suppose that the larger grinders are earlier required by the frugivorous Chimpanzees and Orangs than by the higher organised omnivorous spe- cies with more numerous and varied resources, and probably one main condition of the earlier * See my Odontography, pi. 110,^. 2, m. development of the canines and premolars in Man may be their smaller relative size. In the South American Quadrumana, the number of teeth is increased to thirty-six (art. Quadrumana,Vol. IV. p.210.; Cebince*), by an addition of one tooth to the molar series on each side of both jaws. It might be concluded, a priori, that as three is the typical number of true molars in the placental Mam- malia with two sets of teeth, the additional tooth in the Cebince would be a premolar, and form one step to the resumption of the normal number (four) of that kind of teeth. The proof of the accuracy of this inference is given by the state of the dentition in the young Cebus in fig. 589., which corresponds with that of the human child in fig. 584., i. e. the whole of the Fig. 589. Deciduous and permanent teeth of Cebus. deciduous dentition is retained, and the first true molar {»/. 1) is in place on each side of both jaws. The germs of the other teeth of the permanent series are exposed in the upper jaw ; and the crown of a premolar is found above the third molar in place, as well as above the second and first. As regards number, therefore, the molar series, in Cebus, is interme- diate between that of Musteta {fig. 5S0., IV.) and Felis (ib. V.) ; the little premolar p.i. in Alustcla tells plainly enough which of the four is wanting to complete the typical number in the South American Monkey, and which is the additional premolar distinguishing its dental formula from that of the Old World monkeys ami man. By reference to Prof. Vro- lik's article (Quadrumana) it will be seen that the eighth genus, including the little Marmoset monkeys {Hapale, Ouistiii), " have only the same number of teeth as the monkeys 4 1—1 of the Old World, viz. 32, i. r, c. -—- m. * I — 1 5 5 -—-." But the difference is much greater than this numerical conformity would intimate. In a young Jacehus penicillatus I find that there are three deciduous molars displaced by three premolars, as in the other South Ame- rican Quadrumana, and that it is the last true molar, in. 3, the development of which is sup- pressed, not the premolar p. 2, and thus these diminutive squirrel-like monkeys actually differ * The dental series seems, unluckily, not to have been complete in either of the skulls represented by the distinguished author of that aide article ( fin's 132, 133).TEETH. 922 from the Old World Quadrumana more than the CebidcB do; i. e. they differ not only in having four teeth (p. 2 |—^), which the monkeys of the Old World do not possess, but also by wanting four teeth (m. 3 j j), which those monkeys, as well as the Ccbkkc, actually have. It is thus that the investigation of the exact homologies of parts leads to a recognition of the true characters indicative of zoological affinity. 3—3 Most of the Lemurincc have p. 3—m' 3 3 , together with remarkable modifications 3—X ° of their incisive and canine teeth, of which an extreme example is shown in the pectinated tooth (fig. 550.) of the Gakupitlwcus. The inferior incisors slope forwards in all, and the canines also, which are contiguous to them, and very similar in shape. In the Chirogaleus these canines are entered as in- cisors in the dental formula of the genus (Vol. IV. p. 215), and the laniariform premolar (p. 2) is entered as a canine : M. Vrolik also describes four teeth on each side of the upper jaw, and four on each side of the lower jaw, as true tuberculated molars. They have tuber- culated crowns, but the value of shape as a character is too small to permit our accepting so great an anomaly without the requisite proof of their order of development and suc- cession. Even in the hoofed quadrupeds with toes in uneven number (Perissodactyhi), whose premolars, for the most part, repeat both the form and the complex structure of the true molars, such premolars are distinguished by the same character of development as those of the Artiodactyla, or Ungulates with toes in even number ; although in these the premolars are distinguished also by modifications of size and shape. The complex ridged and tuber- culate crowns of the second, third, and fourth grinders of the Rhinoceros, Hyrax (fig. 590.), Fig. tooth be determined, and its proper symbol applied to it. In pi. 136, fig. 5, of my Odontography, the three posterior teeth of the almost uniform grinding series of the horse's dentition are thus proved to be the only ones entitled to the name of " true molars;" and, if any one should doubt the certainty of the rule of count- ing, by which the symbols, /;. 4, p. 3, and p. 2, arc applied to the three large anterior grinding teeth (ib. fig. 19), which are commonly the only premolars present in each lateral series of the horse's jaws, yet the occasional retention of the diminutive tooth,/;. 1 (ib.fig. 6), would establish its accuracy, whether such tooth be regarded as the first of the deciduous series unusually long retained, or the unusually small and speedily lost successor (p. 1) of an abortive d 1. The law of development, so beautiful for its instructiveness and constancy in the pla- cental D'vphyodonts, is here illustrated in the little Hyrax (fig. 591.), in which the d. 1 is Fig. 591.

The elephant, which by its digital characters belongs to the odd-toed, or perissodactyle, group of Pachyderms, also resembles them in the close agreement in form and structure of the grinding teeth representing the premolars, 590. Molar series, upper jaw (Hyrax). and horse, no more prove them to be true molars, than the trenchant shape of the lower carnassials of the lion proves them to be false molars. It is by development alone that the primary division of the series of grinding teeth can be established, and by that character only can the homologies of each individual with those that answer to the true molars of the Hyrax, Tapir, and Rhinoceros. The gi- gantic Proboscidian Pachyderms of Asia and Africa present, however, so many peculiarities of structure, as to have led to their being located in a particular family in the Systematic Mammalogies. And this seems to be justified293 TEETH. * Loc, cit, p. 212. in plate 5. by no character more than by the singular seeming exception which they present to the Diphyodont rule which governs the dentition of other hoofed quadrupeds. In fact, the elephant, like the Dugong, sheds anil replaces vertically only its incisors, which are also two in number, very long, and of constant growth, forming tusks, with an analogous sexual dif- erence in this respect in the female of the Asiatic species. The molars, also, are suc- cessively lost, are not vertically replaced, and are reduced finally to one on each side of both jaws, which is larger than any of its pre- decessors. These analogies are interesting and suggestive in connection with the other approximations in the " Sirenia" to the pa- chydermal type, which I have pointed out in the " Proceedings of the Zoological Society." * The dentition of the genus E/cphas, the sole existing modification of the once numerous and varied Proboscidian family, includes two long tusks (Jig. 592.), one in each of the Intermaxillary bones, and large and complex molars (ib. m. 3, 4, and 5) in botli jaws : of the latter there is never more than one wholly, or two partially, in place and use on each side at any given time; for, like the molars of the Mastodons, the series is continually in progress of formation and destruction, of shedding and replacement ; and in the ele- phants all the grinders succeed one another like true molars horizontally, from behind forwards. The total number of teeth developed in the , • 2—2 6—6 elephant appears to be i. ^—m. g—g = 28.

The permanent tusks cut the gum when about an inch in length, a least six, of which the last three may, by analogy, be regarded as answering to the true molars of other Pachyderms. I have shown in my Odontography that : — " The deciduous tusk makes its appearance beyond the gum between the fifth and seventh month ; it rarely exceeds two inches in length, and is about a third of an inch in diameter at its thickest part, where it protrudes from the socket ; the fang is solidified, and con- tracts to its termination, which is commonly a little bent, and is considerably absorbed by the time the tooth is shed, which takes place between the first and second year.f * 1838, p. 40. t See Mr. Corse's " Memoir on the Teeth of the Elephant," in Philosophical Transactions, 1799, p. 211: a good figure of the deciduous tusk is given Section of cranium and tush of the Elephant. month or two, usually, after the milk-tusks are shed. At this period, according to Mr. Corse *, the permanent tusks are ' black and ragged at the ends. When they become longer, and project beyond the lip, they soon are worn smooth by the motion and friction of the trunk.' Their widely open base is fixed upon a conical pulp, which, with the capsule sur- rounding the base of the tusk and the socket, continues to increase in size and depth, ob- literating all vestiges of that cf the deciduous tusk, and finally extending its base close to the nasal aperture (fig. 592.). The tusk is formed by successive calcification of layers of the pulp in contact with the inner surface of the pulp cavity ; and, being subject to no habitual attrition from an opposed tooth, but being worn only by the occasional uses to which it is applied, it arrives at an extraor- dinary length, following the curve originallyTEETH. 924 impressed upon it by the form of the socket, and gradually widening from the projecting apex to that part which was formed when the matrix and the socket had reached their full size. " These incisive teeth of the elephant not only surpass other teeth in size, as belonging to a quadruped so enormous, but they are the largest of all teeth in proportion to the size of the body; representing in a natural state those monstrous incisors of the Rodents, which are the result of accidental suppression of the wearing force of the opposite teeth." The tusks of the elephant, like those of the Mastodon, consist chiefly of that modifi- cation of dentine which is called " ivory," and which shows, on transverse fractures or sec- tions, striae proceeding in the arc of a circle from the centre to the circumference, in op- posite directions, and forming by their decus- sations curvilinear lozenges. This character is peculiar to the Proboscidian Pachyderms. In the Indian elephant the tusks are always short and straight in the female, and less deeply implanted than in the male : she thus retaining, as usual, more of the charac- ters of the immature state. In the male the}' have been known to acquire a length of nine feet, with a basal diameter of eight inches, and to weigh one hundred and fifty pounds ; but these dimensions are rare in the Asiatic •species. Mr. Corse, speaking of the variety of Indian elephant, called "Dauntelah" from its large tusks, which project almost horizontally with a slight curve upwards and outwards, says," The largest I have known in Bengal did not exceed seventy-two pounds avoirdupois; at Tiperah they seldom exceed fifty pounds." There are varieties of the Dauntelah in which the large tusks of the male are nearly or quite straight ; and in a more marked breed called " Mooknah," the tusks are much smaller, are straight, and point directly downwards. These ascertained varieties in an existing species ought to weigh with the observers of analo- gous varieties in the teeth of fossil Probos- cidians, before they pronounce definitely on their value as characters of distinct species. More anomalous varieties occasionally pre- sent themselves in the Indian Elephant, as when one tusk is horizontal, the other ver- tical; or when, from some distortion of the alveolus, a spiral direction is impressed upon the growth of the tusk, as in that specimen figured by Grew in the " Rarities of Gresham College," Tab. 4., and which is now in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The tusk of the elephant is slightly moveable in its socket, and readily receives a new direction of growth from habitual pres- sure ; this often causes distorted tusks in captive elephants, and Cuvier * relates the mode in which advantage was taken of the eame impressibility, in order to rectify the growth of such tusks in an elephant kept at the Garden of Plants. The tusks of the extinct Elephas primi- * Ossemens Fossiles, 4to. 1821, torn. i. p. 47. genius, or Mammoth, have a bolder and more extensive curvature than those of the Elephas indicus: some have been found which describe a circle; but, the curve being oblique, they thus clear the head, and point outwards, downwards, and backwards. The numerous fossil tusks of the Mammoth which have been discovered and recorded, may be ranged under two averages of size: the larger ones at nine feet and a half, the smaller at five feet and a half in length. I have elsewhere * as- signed reasons for the probability of the latter belonging to the female Mammoth, which must accordingly have differed from the exist- ing elephant of India, and more resembles that of Africa in the development of her tusks ; yet manifesting an intermediate cha- racter by their smaller size. Of the tusks which are referable to the male Mammoth, one from the newer tertiary deposits in Essex, measured nine feet ten inches along the outer curve, and two feet five inches in circum- ference at its thickest part; another from Eschscholtz Bay was nine feet two inches in length, and two feet one and a half inches in circumference, and weighed one hundred and sixty pounds. A Mammoth's tusk has been dredged up off Dungeness which measured eleven feet in length. In several of the in- stances of Mammoth's tusks from British strata, the ivory has been so little altered as to be fit for the purposes of manufacture ; and the tusks of the Mammoth, which are still better preserved in the frozen drift of Siberia, have long been collected in great numbers as articles of commerce.-j- Cuvier \ states that the elephant of Africa, at least in certain localities, has large tusks in both sexes, and that the female of this species, which lived seventeen years in the menagerie of Louis XIV., had larger tusks than those in any Indian elephant, male or female, of the same size which he had seen. The ivory of the tusks of the African ele- phant is most esteemed by the manufacturer for its density and whiteness. The molar teeth of the elephant are re- markable for their great size, even in relation to the bulk of the animal, and for the extreme complexity of their structure. The crown, of which a great proportion is buried in the socket, and very little more than the grinding surface appears above the gum, is deeply di- vided into a number of transverse perpen- dicular plates {Jig. 557), consisting each of a body of dentine (a), coated by a layer of enamel (<?), and this again by the less dense bone-like * History of British Fossil Mammalia, 8vo. 1844, p. 244. f In the account of the Mammoth's bones and teeth of Siberia, published in the " Philosophical Transactions " for 1737 (No. 446), tusks are cited which weighed two hundred pounds each, and " are used as ivory, to make comhs, boxes, and such other things; being but little more brittle, and easily turning yellow by weather and heat." Prom that time to the present there has been no inter- mission in the supply of ivory, furnished by the tusks of the extinct elephants of a former world. % Loc. cit., p. 55.925 TEETH. substance (c) which fills the interspaces of the enamelled plates, and here more especially merits the name of " cement," since it binds together the several divisions of the crown before they are fully formed and united by the confluence of their bases into a common body of dentine. As the calcification of each plate begins at the summit, they remain de- tached from each other and like so many se- parate teeth or denticules, until their base is completed, when it becomes blended with the bases of contiguous plates to form the common body of the crown of the complex tooth from which the roots are next developed. The plates of the molar teeth of the Si- berian Mammoth (Elephas primigenius) are thinner in proportion to their breadth, and are generally a little expanded at the middle ; and they are more numerous in proportion to the size of the crown than in the existing species of Asiatic Elephant. In the African Elephant, on the other hand, the lamellar divisions of the crown are fewer and thicker, and they expand more uniformly from the margins to the centre, yielding a lozenge-form when cut or worn transversely, as in masti- cation. The horizontal as well as vertical course of development of the elephant's grinder is well illustrated by the Mammoth's molar, the last of the lower jaw. The separate digital processes of the posterior plates are still distinct, and adhere only by the re- maining cement ; a little in advance we see them united to form the transverse plate ; and, at the opposite extremity of the tooth, the common base of dentine is exposed by which the plates are finally blended into one individual complex grinder*; this never takes place simultaneously along the whole course of the tooth in the larger molars of the existing Indian elephant, or its extinct congener, the Mammoth. The African ele- phant, and some of the extinct Indian species, as the El. planifrons, manifest their affinity to the Mastodon by the basal confluence of the hindmost plates before the foremost ones are worn out. The formation of each grinder begins with the summits of the anterior plate, and the rest are completed in succession ; the tooth is gradually advanced in position as its growth proceeds; and, in the existing Indian elephant, the anterior plates are brought into use before the posterior ones are formed. When the complex molar cuts the gum the cement is first rubbed off the digital summits: then their enamel cap is worn away, and the * Some anatomists describe the divisions of the crown of the elephant's grinder as so many " distinct teeth;" and Mr. Corse (loc. cit. p. 213,), who first propounded this view, calls each complex grinder " a case of teeth," and states " that these teeth are merely joined to each other by an intermediate softer substance, acting like a cement." But this description applies only to the imperfectly-formed tooth; and the detached eminences of the crown of any complex tooth, at that stage of growth when they are held together only by the still uncalcified supporting matrix, might with equal justice be regarded as so many distinct teeth. central dentine comes into play with a promi- nent enamel ring ; the digital processes are next ground down to their common uniting base, and a transverse tract of dentine with its wavy border of enamel is exposed ; finally, the transverse plates themselves are abraded to their common base of dentine, and a smooth and polished tract of that substance is pro- duced.* From this basis the roots of the molar are developed, and increase in length to keep the worn crown on the grinding level, until the reproductive force is exhausted. When the whole extent of a grinder has successively come into play, its last part is reduced to a long fang supporting a smooth and polished field of dentine, with, perhaps, a few remnants of the bottom of the enamel folds at its hinder part. When the complex molar has been thus worn down to a uni- form surface it becomes useless as an instru- ment for grinding the coarse vegetable sub- stances on which the elephant subsists ; it is attacked by the absorbent action, and the wasteil portion of the molar is finally shed. The grinding teeth of the elephant pro- gressively increase in size, and in the number of lamellar divisions, from the first to the last; and, as the rate of increase in both respects is nearly identical in both jaws, I shall describe them chiefly as they appear in the lower one. The first molar, which cuts the gum in the course of the second.week after birth, has a sub-compressed crown, nine lines in antero- posterior diameter, divided by three trans- verse clefts into four plates, the third being the broadest, and the tooth here measuring six lines across f ; the first and second plates have two mammilloid summits ; the third and fourth have three or four such; there is a sin- gle and sometimes a double mammilloid sum- mit at the fore and back part of the crown : the base slightly contracts, and forms a neck as long as the enamelled crown, but of less breadth, and this divides into two, an anterior and posterior, long, sub-cylindrical, diverging, but mutually incurved fangs ; the total length of this tooth is one inch and a half. The corresponding upper molar, which Mr. Corse describes as cutting the gum a little earlier than the lower one, has the anterior single digital process or mammilla, and the pos- terior talon developed into a fifth plate, smaller than the fourth, with which its middle part is confluent; the neck of this tooth is shorter, and the two fangs are shorter, larger, and more compressed than those of the lower first molar. This tooth is the homologne of the probably deciduous molar ((/. 2) in other * In the fossil specimen figured in plate 147, of my " Odontography," the left molar 7, exhibits all the above-described gradations of use ; but the right molar, r, through some accident to the opposing tooth in the lower jaw, has not been so worn, but projects beyond the level of the left molar, with the mammillated margins of the plates en- tire. t Those are also the dimensions of the first lower molar figured by Mr. Corse, loc. cit. pi. vi.Jig. 1, d, and /fy. 3 ; but I have seen the first lower molar of smaller dimensions.92G TEETH. Ungulates; it is not a mere miniature of the great molars of the mature animal, but re- tains, agreeably with the period of life at which it is developed, a character much more nearly approaching that of the ordinary Pa- chydermal molar, manifesting the adherence to the more general type by the minor com- plexity of the crown, and by the form and relative size of the fangs. In the transverse divisions of the crown we perceive the affinity to the Tapiroid type, the different links con- necting which with the typical elephants are supplied by the extinct Lophiodons, Dino- theriums, and Mastodons. The sub-division of the summits of the primary plates recalls the character of the molars, especially the smaller ones, of the Phacochere in the Hog- tribe. As the elephant advances in age the molars rapidly acquire their more special and complex character. The first molars are completely in place, and in full use at three months, and are shed when the elephant is about two years old. The sudden increase and rapid develop- ment of the second molar may account for the non-existence of any vertical successor to the former tooth, or "premolar," in the elephant. The eight or nine plates of the crown are formed in the closed alveolus, behind the first molar by the time this cuts the gum, and they are united with the body of the tooth, and most of them in use, when the first molar is shed. The average length of the second molar is two inches and a half; ranging from two inches to two inches and nine lines. The greatest breadth, which is behind the middle of the tooth, is from one inch to one inch three lines. There are two roots : the cavity of the small anterior one expands in the crown, and is continued into that of the three anterior plates. The thicker root supports the rest of the tooth. The second molar is worn out and shed before the beginning of the sixth year. The third molar has the crown divided into from eleven to thirteen plates ; it averages four inches in length, and two inches in breadth, and has a small anterior, and a very large posterior root; it begins to appear above the gum about the end of the second year, is in its most complete state and exten- sive use during the fifth year, and is worn out and shed in the ninth year. The last rem- nant of the third molar is shown at vi. 3, fig. 592. It is probable that the three teeth above de- scribed are homologous with the deciduous mo- lars, d. 2, d.3, and d. 4. in the Hyrax and horse. The fourth molar presents a marked supe- riority of size over the third, and a somewhat different form : the anterior angle is more obliquely abraded, giving a pentagonal figure to the tooth in the upper jaw (fig. 592. m. 4). The number of plates in the crown of this tooth is fifteen or sixteen : its length between seven and eight inches; its breadth three inches. It has an anterior simple and slender root supporting the three first plates; a second of larger size and bifid, supporting the four next plates; and a large contracting base for the remainder. The fore-part of the grinding surface of this tooth begins to pro- trude through the gum at the sixth year: the tooth is worn away, and its last remnant shed, about the twentieth or twenty-fifth year. It may be regarded as the homologue of the first true molar of ordinary Pachyderms (in. 1). The fifth molar, with a crown of from seventeen to twenty plates, measures between nine and ten inches in length, and about three inches and a half in breadth. The second root is more distinctly separated from the first simple root than from the large mass behind. It begins to appear above the gum about the twentieth year : its duration has not been ascertained by observation ; but it probably is not shed before the sixtieth year. The sixth molar appears to be the last, and has from twenty-two to twenty-seven plates; its length, or antero-posterior extent, following the curvature, is from twelve to fifteen inches : the breadth of the grinding surface rarely exceeds three inches and a half. The reproductive power of the matrix in some cases surpasses that of the formative development of the cavity for lodging the tooth, and the last lamellse are obliged to be folded from behind forwards upon the side of the tooth. Fig. 99, p. 233. of my " History of British Fossil Mammals," shows this condition in the last lower molar of the Mammoth. One may reasonably conjecture that the sixth molar of the Indian elephant, if it make its appearance about the fiftieth year, would, from its superior depth and length, continue to do the work of mastication until the pon- derous Pachyderm had passed the century of its existence. Mr. Corse has figured the sixth molar, (which he calls the seventh or eighth,) with twenty-three plates, in tab. x. of his Memoir, and a small cavity, c, is marked as an in- cipient alveolus for a succeeding grinder. Had it actually been such, it might have been expected to contain some calcified portions of the anterior plates of such succeeding grinder. The molar teeth, in all the species of elephant, succeed each other from behind forwards, moving, not in a right line, but in the arc of a circle, shown by the curved line in fig. 592. The position of the growing tooth in the closed alveolus (m. 5) is almost at right angles with that in use, the grinding surface being at first directed backwards in the upper jaw, and forwards in the lower jaw, and brought, by the revolving course, into a horizontal line in both jaws, so that they oppose each other, when developed for use. The imaginary pivot on which the grinders revolve is next their root in the upper jaw, and is next the grinding surface in the lower jaw ; in both, towards the frontal surface of the skull. Viewing both upper and lower molars as one complex whole, subject to the same revolving movement, the section dividing such whole into upper and lower portion runsTEETH. 927 parallel to the curve described by that move- ment, the upper being the central portion, or that nearest the pivot, the lower, the pe- ripheral portion : the grinding surface of the upper molars is consequently convex from behind forwards, and that of the lower molars concave: the upper molars are always broader than the lower ones. The bony plate forming the sockets of the growing teeth is more than usually distinct from the hotly of the maxillary, and participates in this re- volving course, advancing forwards with the teeth. The partition between the tooth in use and its successor is perforated near the middle; and, in its progress forwards, that part next the grinding surface is first absorbed ; the rest disappearing with the absorption of the roots of the preceding grinder. There are few examples of organs that manifest a more striking adaptation of a highly complex and beautiful structure to the exigencies of the animal endowed with it, than the grinding teeth of the elephant. We per- ceive, for example, that the jaw is not en- cumbered with the whole weight of the mas- sive tooth at once, but that it is formed by degrees as it is required ; the division of the crown into a number of successive plates, and the subdivision of these into cylindrical pro- cesses, presenting the conditions most favour- able to progressive formation. But a more important advantage is gained by this sub- division of the tooth ; each part is formed like a perfect simple tooth, having a body of dentine, a coat of enamel, and an outer in- vestment of cement: a single digital pro- cess may be compared to the simple canine of a Carnivore ; a transverse row of these, therefore, when the work of mastication has commenced, presents, by virtue of the different densities of their constituent sub- stances, a series of cylindrical ridges of ena- mel, with as many depressions of dentine, and deeper external valleys of cement : the more advanced and more abraded part of the crown is traversed by the transverse ridges of the enamel inclosing the depressed surface of the dentine, and separated by the deeper channels of the cement : the fore-part of the tooth exhibits its least efficient con- dition for mastication ; the inequalities of the grinding surface being reduced in proportion as the enamel and cement which invested the dentinal plates have been worn away. This part of the tooth is, however, still fitted for the first coarse crushing of the branches of a tree: the transverse enamel ridges of the succeeding part of the tooth divide it into smaller fragments, and the posterior islands and tubercles of enamel pound it to the pulp fit for deglutition. The structure and pro- gressive development of the tooth not only give to the elephant's grinder the advantage of the uneven surface which adapts the mill- stone for its office, but, at the same time, secure the constant presence of the most efficient arrangement for the finer comminu- tion of the food, at the part of the mouth which is nearest the fauces. With regard to the microscopic structure of the peculiar modification of dentine called " ivory," this is characterised partly by the minute size of the tubes, which, at their origin from the pulp cavity, do not exceed TTi__th of an inch in diameter, in their close arrangement at intervals scarcely exceeding the breadth of a single tube, and, above all, on their strong and almost angular gyrations, which are much greater than the secondary curvatures of the tubes of ordinary dentine. The dentinal tubes of ivory, as they radiate from the pulp-cavity, incline obliquely towards the pointed end of the tusk, and describe two slight primary curves, the first convex towards that end, the second and shorter one concave ; these curves in narrow sections from near the open base of the tusk are almost obscured by the strong angular parallel secondary gyrations. The tubes divide dicho- tomously, at acute angles, and gradually de- crease in size as they approach the periphery of the tusk. The characteristic appearance of decussating curved stria?, with oblique rhomboidal spaces, so conspicuous on transverse sections or frac- tures of ivory, is due to the refraction of light caused by the parallel secondary gyrations of the tubes above described. The strong con- tour lines observed in longitudinal sections of ivory, parallel with the cone of the pulp-cavity, and which are circular and concentric when viewed in transverse slices of the tusk, are commonly caused by strata of minute opaque cellules, which are unusually numerous in the interspaces of the tubes throughout the sub- stance of the ivory, and by their very great abundance and larger size in the peripheral layers of cement. The close-set lateral branches of the ealcigerous tubes unite with the tubuli of the cells. The decomposition of the fossil tusks into superimposed conical layers takes place along the strata of the opaque cellules, and directly across the course of the ealci- gerous gyrating tubes. The radiated cells of the true cement are larger and more uniform in size and shape; many of them approach nearer the circular figure than in ordinary teeth ; the long axis of the more elliptical ones is parallel with the plane of the stratum of cement; their average diameter is ^^L^th of an inch, and their interspaces sometimes do not exceeel that dimension. The cemental tubuli appear from their course, and sometimes from the overlapping of the substances in the sections examined, to be directly continued from the tubuli of the ivory ; but Retzius expressly denies the continuation, and states that the cemental tubes at both the outer and the inner surface of the cement have terminations of less diameter than their middle part. This is exact with respect to the major part of the cement. In that near the base of the tusk I have seen a few vascular canals. The contour lines of the cement are usually wavy, and not parallel with the line of the outer surface of the ivory. In the tusks of the Mastodon giganlcus theTEETH. 928 outer layer of cement is relatively thicker than in the tusks of the Mammoth or in those of the Indian elephant. The general cha- racter of the microscopic structure of the ivory of the Mastodon's tusk is the same as that of the elephant. The peripheral ex- tremities of the dentinal tubes are, in some parts of the tusk, straighter than in the rest of their course; the straighter extremities were those which were first formed in the calcification of the peripheral part of the pulp, and this first-formed ivory is accordingly, in such parts, more like the ordinary dentine, and is analogous to the thin peripheral cap of such substance in the teeth of the Sloth and of some fishes. The pulp soon, however, becomes subject to that modification of the calcifying processes by which the more tortuous disposition of the tubuli and the more frequent interposition of opaque cellules are produced ; modifications which, in establishing the characters of ivory, present a step in the transition from true dentine to osteo-dentine. By the minuteness and close arrangement of the tubes, and especially by their strongly undulating secondary curves, a tougher and more elastic tissue is produced than results from their disposition in ordinary dentine ; and the modification which distinguishes " ivory" is doubtless essential to the due degree of coherence of so large a mass as the elephant's tusk, projecting so far from the supporting socket, and to be frequently applied in dealing hard blows and thrusts. The central part of the tusk, especially near the base of such as have reached their full size, is occupied by a slender cylindrical tract of modified ivory, perforated by a few vascular canals, which is continued to the apex of the tusk. It is not uncommon to find processes of osteo-dentine or imperfect bone-like ivory, projecting in a stalactitic form * into the interior of the pulp-cavity, apparently the consequence of partial inflam- mation or malformation of the vascular pulp. The musket-balls and other foreign bodies which are occasionally found in ivory, are immediately surrounded by osteo-dentine in greater or less quantity. It has long ceased to be a matter of wonder how such bodies should become completely imbedded in the substance of the tusk, sometimes without any visible aperture, or how a leaden bullet may have become lodged in the solid centre of a very large tusk without having been flattened. Such a ball, aimed at the head of an elephant, may penetrate the thin bony socket and the thinner ivory parietes of the wide conical pulp-cavity occupying the inserted base of the tusk ; if the projectile force was there spent, the ball would gravitate to the opposite and lower side of the pulp-cavity, as indicated in fig. 592.f The presence of the foreign body * Haller seems to have been the first to notice these irregular internal deposits in the pulp-cavity of the elephant's tusk.

The pulp then resuming its healthy state and functions, coats the inner surface of the osteo-dentine in- closing the ball, together with the rest of the conical cavity into which that mass projects, with layers of normal ivory.* The portion of the cement-forming capsule surrounding the base of the tusk, and the part of the pulp, which were perforated by the ball in its passage, are soon replaced by the active reparative power of these highly vascular bodies. The hole formed by the ball in the base of the tusk is then more or less completely filled up by a thick coat of cement from with- out and of osteo-dentine from within. Traces of such a cicatrix closing the entrance have been more than once noticed : and Blumen- bach deduced, therefrom, a property in the elephant's tusk to pour out bony matter in order to heal such wounds. The reparation is however effected by the calcification of the reproduced parts of the capsule and pulp. By the continued progress of growth, the ball so inclosed is carried forwards, in the course indicated by the arrow in Jig. 592., to the middle of the solidified exserted part of the tusk, as in the example in Blumenbach's collection which he considered so curious. Should the ball have penetrated the base of the tusk of a young elephant, it may be carried forwards by the uninterrupted growth of the tusk until that base has become the apex, and be finally exposed and discharged by the con- tinual abrasion to which the apex of the tusk is subjected. Yet none of these phenomena prove the absolute non-vascularity of the tusk, but only the low degree of its vascularity. Blood circulates, slowly no doubt, through the minute vascular canals which are con- tinued through the centre of the ivory to the very apex of the tusk : and it is from this source that the fine tubular structure of the ivory obtains the plasmatic colourless fluid by which its low vitality is maintained. Development.—The matrix of the tusk con- sists of a large conical pulp, which is renewed quicker than it is converted, and thus is not only preserved, but grows, up to a certain period of the animal's life: it is lodged in the cavity at the base of the tusk ; this base is surrounded by the remains of the capsule, a soft vascular membrane of moderate thickness, which is confluent with the border of the base of the pulp, where it receives its principal vessels. pliant Male," fol. p. 54.

Although the pulp could be easily detached from the inner surface of the pulp-cavity, it was not without a certain resistance, and when the edges of the co- adapted pulp and tooth were examined by a strong lens, the filamentary processes from the outer surface of the pulp could be seen stretching, as they were withdrawn from the dentinal tubes, before they broke. They are so minute that, to the naked eye, the detached surface of the pulp seems to be entire, and Cuvier was thus deceived in concluding that there was no organic connection between the pulp and the ivory.* As the learned professor who has contributed the article " Paciiyder- mata " adopts Cuvier's description of the formation of the teeth of the elephant by deposition and transudation of the tissues from free surfaces of the formative organs, I have the more valued the rare opportunity of testing and confirming, by examination of the recent animal, the account of the processes of conversion of those organs into the dental tissues, which I gave in my " Odontography." Each molar of the elephant is formed in the interior of a membranous sac—the capside, the form of which partakes of that of the future tooth, being cubical in the first molar, oblong in the last, and rhomboidal in most of the intermediate teeth ; but always decreasing in vertical extent towards its posterior end, and closed at all points, save where it is penetrated by vessels and nerves. It is lodged in an osseous cavity of the same form as itself, and usually in part suspended freely in the maxillary bone ; the bony case being destined to form part of the socket of the tooth. The exterior of the membranous capsule is simple and vascular, as shown at m. 5, fg. 592. ; its internal surface gives attachment to numerous folds or processes, as in most other Ungulate animals. The dentinal pulp rises from the bottom of the capsule, or that part which lines the deepest part of the alveolus, in the form of transverse parallel plates extending towards that part of the capsule ready to escape from the socket. These plates adhere only to the bottom of the capsule ; their opposite extremity is free from all adhesion. This summit is thinner than the base ; it might be termed the edge of the plate: but it is notched, or divided into many digital processes. The tissue of these digitated plates is identical with that of the dentinal pulp of simple Mammalian teeth ; it becomes also highly vascular at the parts where the formation of the dentine is in active progress. Processes of the capsule descend from its summit into the interspaces of the dentinal pulp-plates, and consequently resemble them in form ; but they adhere not only by their * Annales du Museum, torn. viii. (1806), p. 94. The account is repeated verbatim in the posthumous edition of the "Ossemens Fossiles," 183G. VOL. IV. base to the surface of the capsule next the mouth, but also by their lateral margins to the sides of the capsule, and thus resemble partition-walls, confining each plate of the dentinal pulp to its proper chamber ; the margin of the partition opposite its attached base is free in the interspace of the origins of the dentinal pulp plates. The enamel organ, which Cuvier appears to have recognised under the name of the internal layer of the capsule, is distinguishable by its light blue sub-transparent colour and usual microscopic texture, adhering to the free surface of the partitions formed by the true inner layer of the capsule. Although the enamel-pulp be in close contact with the dentinal pulp prior to the commencement of the formation of the tooth, one may readily conceive a vacuity between them, which is continued uninter- ruptedly, in many foldings, between all the gelatinous plates of the dentinal pulp, and the partitions formed by the combined enamel- pulp and the folds of the capsule. According to the excretion-view, this delicate apparatus must have been immediately subjected to the violence of being compressed in the unyielding bony box, by the deposition of the elense matters of the tooth in the hypothetical vacuity between the enamel and dentinal pulps; a process of absorption must have been con- ceived to be set on foot immediately that the altered condition of the gelatinous secreting organs took place ; and, according to Cuvier's hypothesis, the secreting function must be supposed to have proceeded, without any ir- regularity or interruption, while the process of absorption was superinduced in the same part to relieve it from the effects of pressure produced by its own secretion. The formation of the dentine commences immediately beneath the membrana prriprla of the pulp: a part which Cuvier distinctly recognised, and which he accurately traced as preserving its relative situation between the dentine and enamel throughout the whole formation of the dentine, and discernible in the completed tooth i£ as a verv fine greyish line, which separates the enamel from the in- ternal substance " or dentine. The calcification and conversion of the cells of the dentinal pulp commence as usual at the peripheral parts of the lamelliform pro- cesses furthest from the attached base. It may readily be conceived, therefore, that, at the commencement, there is formed a little cap upon each of the processes into which the edges of the pulp-plates are divided. As the centripetal calcification proceeds the caps are converted into horn-shaped cones ; when it has reached the bottom of the notches of the edge of the pulp-plate all the cones be- come united together into a single transverse plate ; and, the process of conversion having reached the base of the pulp-plate, these plates coalesce to form a common base to the crown of the tooth, which would then present the same eminences and notches that charac- terised the gelatinous pulp, if, during the period of conversion, other substances had 3 o930 TEETH. not been formed upon the surface and in the interspaces of the pulp-plates. Coincident, however, with the formation of the dentine, is the deposition of the hard- ening salts of the enamel in the extremely slender prismatic cells, which are for the most part vertical to the plane of the inner surface of the folds of the capsule to which they are attached ; these cells or moulds give a sub- transparent bluish tint to the enamel pulp. The true inner part of the capsule forms those thick transverse folds or partitions which support the enamel organ, and with it fill the interspaces of the dentinal pulps. With re- gard to the formation of the cement, Cuvier, alter citing the opinion of Tenon — that it was the result of ossification of the internal layer of the capsule, and that of Blake — that it was a deposition from the opposite surface of the capsule to that which had deposited the enanael, states his own conviction to be that the cement is produced by the same iayer and by the same surface as that which has produced the enamel. The proof alleged is, that so long as any space remains between the cement and the external capsule, that space is found to contain a soft internal layer of the capsule with a free surface next the cement. The phenomena could not, in fact, be otherwise explained according to the " ex- cretion theory " of dental development. To the obvious objection that the same part is made, hi this explanation, to secrete two different products, Cuvier replies, that it un- dergoes a change of tissue : " Whilst it yielded enamel only it was thin and transparent; to give cement it becomes thick, spongy, and of a reddish colour." * The external characters of the enamel organ and cement-forming cap- sule are correctly defined; only, the one, in- stead of being .converted into the other, is in fact changed into its supposed transudation : the enamel fibres being formed, and properly disposed in the direction in which their chief Strength is to lie, by the assimilatiye proper- ties of the pre-arranged elongated prismatic non-nneleated cells, which take from the sur- rounding plasma the required salts and com- pact them in their interior. Whilst this process is on foot, and before the enamel fibres are firm in their position, the capsule begins to undergo that change which results in the formation of the thick cement; the calcifying process commences from several points, and proceeds centrifu- gaily, radiating therefrom, and differing from the ossification of bone chief!)' in the number of these centres, which, though close to the new-formed enamel, are in the substance of the inner vascular surface of the capsular folds. The cells arrange themselves in con- centric layers around the vessels, and act * " Seulement elle change de tissue: tant qu'elle ne dounait que de l'email, elle etait mince et fcransr parents; pour doaner du cortical elle devient epaisse, spongieuse, opaque et rougeatre." — Annales du Museum, torn. viii. p. 99; Ossemens Fossiles, ed. 1S;J4, 8vo. torn, i p. 514.

The in- terspaces of the concentric series of confluent cells become filled with the calcareous salts in a rather more opaque state, and the con- version of the capsule into cement goes on, according to the processes more particularly described in the Introduction to my " Odon- tography," until a continuous stratum is formed in close connection with the layer of enamel. The uncalcified part of the capsule, always much softer than cartilage, is very readily detached from the calcified part, and to the naked eye the separated surface seems entire, and might readily pass, as with Cuvier, for a secreting surface. But the fine vascular processes which have been torn from the medullary canals of the calcified part are conspicuous, and resemble villi, when the detached surface is examined, even with a moderate magnifying power, under water. Calcification extending from the numerous centres, the different portions coalesce and progressively add to the thickness of the ce- ment until all the interspaces of the coronal plates and the whole exterior of the crown is covered with the bone-like substance. The enamel-pulp ceases to be developed at the base of the crown, but the capsule continues to be formed pari passu with the partial formation of the pulp, as this continues, pro- gressively contracting, from the base of the crown, to form by its calcification the roots. The calcification of the capsule going on at the same time, a layer of cement is formed in immediate connection with the dentine. The circumscribed spaces at the bottom of the socket to which the capsule and dentinal pulp adhere, where they receive their vessels and nerves, and which are the seat of the progres- sive formation of these respective moulds of the two dental tissues, become gradually con- tracted, and subdivided by the further localis- ation of the reproductive forces to particular spots, whence the subdivision of the base into roots. The surrounding bone undergoes cor- responding modifications, growing and filling up the interspaces left by the dividing and contracting points of attachment of the re- siduary matrix. All is subordinated to one harmonious law of growth by vascular action and cell-formation, and of molecular decre- ment modifying form by absorption. Me- chanical squeezing or drawing out have no share in these changes of the pulp or capsule ; pressure at most exercises only a gentle stimulus to the vital processes. Cuvier be- lieved that there were places where the den- tinal pulp and the capsule were separate from each other. I have never found such except where the enamel-pulp was interposed be- tween them in the crown of the tooth, or where both pulp and capsule adhered to the periosteum of the socket, below the crown.TEETH. 931 3 o 2 Cuvier affirms that the number of fangs of an elephant's molar depends upon the number of points at which the base of the gelatinous (dentinal) pulp is attached to the bottom of the capsule; and that the interspaces of these attachments constitute the under part of the crown or body of the tooth, the attachments themselves forming the first beginnings of the fangs. True to his hypothesis of the forma- tion of the dental tissues by excretion, he says * that the elongation of the fangs is pro- duced by two circumstances : first, the pro- gressive elongation of the layers of osseous substance (dentine) which force the tooth to rise and emerge from its socket; secondly, the thickening of the body of the tooth by the addition of successive layers to its inner sur- face, which, filling up the interior cavity, leaves scarcely room for the gelatinous pulp, and forces it down into the interior of the roots. This pulling up of the fang on the one hand, and squeezing down the pulp on the other, are forces too gross and mechanical to be admitted in actual physiology to explain the growth of the root of a tooth or of any other organised product; such modes of explanation were, however, inevitable in adopting the excretion theory of dental development. With regard to the homologies of the com- plex molars of the Proboscidian quadrupeds, a species of insight whieh may come to be deemed, in the course of anatomical science, as of equal import to the knowledge of the formative processes of parts, I must admit that the mere fact of the marked and dispro- portionate increase of size of the first of the three last molars over its predecessor — the last of the first three that are developed — may appear but a feeble support to the analogical evidence on which, chiefly, I have classed the three last developed molars of the elephant, in a category distinct from that of their smaller predecessors. But the value of such indica- tion and analogy will begin to be apparent when we examine the condition of dental development in the primeval forms of Pro- boscidians. I have already shown that the typical character of the Diphyodont dentition was more closely anil generally adhered to in the genera that existed during the oldest ter- tiary periods in geology than in their actual successors : it became of course highly inter- esting to inquire whether the miocene Mas- todons, the earliest of the great Proboscidian quadrupeds of which we have any cognizance, manifested any analogous closer adhesion to type than their elephantine successors, and whether they would afford any actual proof of the true deciduous nature of the first, * " Ces racines et les pe'dicules qui lour servent de noyaux s'alongent ensuit.e par deux raisons: d'abord les progres des lames de substance osseuse qui, s'alon- geant toujours, forcent la dent a s'e'lever et a sortir de l'alveole; ensuite l'epaississement du corps de la dent par la formation des couches successives qui, en remplissant le vide intc'rieur, n'y laissent presque plus de place pour le noyau gelatineux, et le refoulent vers l'interieur des tubes des racines." Annales du Museum, viii. 1807, p. 108; Ossem. Fossiles, 1834, p. 527. second, or third molars, by the development of a vertical successor or premolar. Cuvier first ascertained the fact, though without ap- preciating its full significance, in a specimen of the upper jaw of the Mastodon angustidens from Dax, in which the second six-lobed deciduous molar was displaced by a four- lobed or quadricuspid premolar developed above it and succeeding it vertically.* The same important fact was subsequently con- firmed by Dr. Kaup in observations of the Mastodon longirostris of the miocene tertiary deposits of Eppelsheim.f This satisfactorily proves the true deci- duous character of the first and second molars ; and that the third molar in order of appear- ance J, is also one (the last) of the de- ciduous series, is indicated by the contrasted superiority of size of the ante-penultimate tooth, which I regard as the first of the true molar series. The great extent and activity of the pro- cesses of dental development required for the preparation of the large and complex true molar teeth would seem to exhaust the power, which, in ordinary Pachyderms, is expended in developing the vertical successors of the deci- duous teeth. In the primeval Mastodons above cited, this normal exercise of the reproductive force was not, however, wholly exhausted, and one premolar, of more simple form than its deciduous predecessor, was developed on each side of both jaws. But even this trace of ad- herence to the archetypal dentition is lost in the more modified Proboscidians of the pre- sent day. Another and very interesting mark of adhe- sion to the archetype is shown by the deve- lopment of two incisors in the lower jaw in the young of some of the Mastodons, by the retention and development of one of these inferior tusks in the male of the Mastodon giganteus of North America, and by the reten- tion of both in the European Mastodon longi- rostris. No trace of these inferior homotypes of the great premaxillary tusks have been detected in the fcetus or young of the existing elephants. In the gigantic Ilinotherium the upper in- cisors were suppressed, and the two lower incisors were developed into huge tusks, which curved down from the symphysis of the massive under jaw. Most of the grinders had two transverse ridges on the crown, as in the Tapir ; two deciduous molars, if not three, were succeeded vertically by two premolars, the second of which (p. 4 of the typical series) closely resembles the true molars, as in other Peiissodactyles. The typical dentition is departed from in the existing Hippopotamus by the early loss of p. 1, and the reduction of the incisors to -—- in both jaws : in the extinct Hippopota- mus of India p. 1 was longer retained, and the * Ossemens Fossiles, 4to.; Divers Mastodontes, pLiii.J%f. 2. f Ossemens Fossiles de Darmstadt, 1835, pi.

I have before remarked that the even-toed or artiodactyle Ungulate superadd the cha- racters of simplified form and diminished size to (he more important and constant one of vertical succession in their premolars. These teeth in the Ruminants, e. g. (Jig. 580., VII., Moscnus,/). 2, 3,4), represent only the moiety of the true molars,oroneof the two semi-cylin- drical lobes of which those teeth consist, with at most a rudiment of the second lobe, as Cuvier very accurately describes *, and F. Cuvier figures in pi. 94. of his useful work, " Dents des Mammiferes." An analogous morphological character of the premolars will be found to distinguish them in the dentition of the genus Sus (figured in my " Odontography," pi. \±0.,fgs. 1 and 2), in the Hippopotamus (ib. pi. 143.), and in the Phacochoerus (ib. pi. 141.), where the premolar series is greatly reduced in number: yet this instance of a natural affinity manifested in so many other parts of the organisation of the artiodactyle genera has been overlooked in F. Cuvier's work above cited, although it is expressly designed to show how such zoological relations are illus- trated by the teeth. Oonfiding in the accuracy of the Baron Cuvier's division of the hoofed quadrupeds into " Pachyderms " and " Rumi- nants," M. F. Cuvier separates the non-ru- minant Artiodactyles from the ruminant ge- nera of the same natural division by interposing the Tapir, Hyrax, Rhinoceros and Elephant ; whilst the horse, which, in the size and com- plexity of its premolars, as well as in many other characters, agrees closely with the other perissodactyle Pachyderms, is placed in close juxtaposition with the Puminants.-)- Most of the deciduous molars of the Rumi- nants resemble in form the true molars; the last, e.g. (Jig. 593., d. 4), has three lobes in the owerjaw | like the last true molar (m. 3.).

J When, therefore, the third grinder of the lower jaw of any new or rare Ruminant shows three lohes, the crowns of the premolars should be sought for in the substance of the jaw below these, and above but there is a rudiment of d. 1 in the embryo fallow-deer, and in one of the most ancient of the extinct Ruminants (Dorcatkerium, Kaup) the normal number of premolars was fully de- veloped. Sufficient, it is hoped, has been adduced to prove that the molar series of the Diphyo- donts is naturally divisible into only two groups, premolars and molars ; that the ty- 4, 4, 3 3 pical number of these is ; and that 1 4—4' 3—3 each individual tooth may be determined and symbolised throughout the series, as is shown in the instances under cut 580. If anything were wanting to prove the artificial character of a three-fold division of these teeth, and the futility of any other classification than that founded upon development, it would be af- forded by the attempt to determine the homo- logous teeth which is exemplified by the dotted line which traverses the series, and which crosses the teeth distinguished by the name " principales" in the great " Osteo- graphie and Odontographie" now in course of publication by Prof, de Blainville. This author abandons the classification of the molar series adopted by the Cuviers, without assigning his objections to it ; and proposes another, in which he divides the series into " avant-molaires, principales, and arriere-molaires;" he exemplifies this division by the human dentition, in which the five grinders on each side of both jaws are for- mulised as " deux avant-molaires, une princi- pale, et deux arriere-molaires."* With regard to the characters of these kinds of teeth, the avant-molaires are " simple or complex," the principale is " trenchant," and the arriere-molaires are " tuberculous." f But as shape is not a constant character, especially in the "principale," the author pro- poses another from its position, describing it as " being implanted below the root of the zygomatic process of the maxillary bone " in the upper jaw ; and stating that the tooth which opposes it below, and is in advance of it, or crosses in front of it, is the lower " principale." In defining the dentition of the genus Felis%, M. de Blainville accordingly assigns 1 "avant- molaire," 1 " principale," and 2 " arriere- molaires" in the upper jaw ; and 1 "avant- molaire," I " principale," and 1 " arriere-mo- laire " in the lower jaw. In another part of the same work §, he, however, proposes another formula, viz., 2 " avant-molaires," 1 " princi- pale," and 1 " arriere-molaire " above ; 1 " avant-molaire," 1 " principale," and 1 " ar- riere-molaire " below; but, taking either of these determinations, or the dental formula; which he assigns to other carnivorous genera, and comparing them with his formula of the their opponents in the upper jaw; and thus the true characters of the permanent dentition may be ascertained. * Oste'ographie, torn. i. p. 43. t Ib. p. 43. 1 Oste'ographie des Carnivores, p.

I may refer to my Paper on the Classification of the Molar Teeth in the " Annates des Sciences,"* and to the concluding pages of the chapter on the teeth of the Carmvora in my " Odontography " (p. 514), in proof that a " molaire principale " does not exist in nature ; that the characters by which it is defined by M. de Blainville are artificial; and that they fail in their application to determine the teeth in the series of pla- cental Mammalia with deciduous and perma- nent teeth. In the series of figures, Jig. 580., the continuous line traverses the tooth or its homologue, in Man and the Ruminant, which Cuvier distinguished as the " molaire carnas- siere:" the dotted line traverses that tooth which M. de Blainville distinguishes as the " molaire principale :" the letters and numbers symbolise the teeth and indicate their indi- vidual homologies, and the binary division of the molar series, which it has been one object of the present Article to illustrate. I shall conclude it by showing how these symbols may be applied to the exposition of tacts in the comparative anatomy of the teeth, and for that purpose select the complex and intricate subject of the succession of the teeth in the kangaroo.. The chief modifications of the marsupial dentition are described and illustrated in the article Marsupialia (Vol. III.pp.258—298.). When that volume was published I had not had the means of tracing the period and order of the development and succession of the entire series of teeth in any of the marsupial genera. The first of the five grinding teeth on each side of the jaws of the wombat had shown, by its displacing a milk-tooth vertically, that it was a premolar ; and the adjoining molar, by its earlier development and use, was plainly the first of the four true molar teeth. In the carnivorous anil insectivorous families, the marked difference of form and size of the last four teeth from those intervening between them and the canines, had also induced me to class them as true molars, although I had not got the developmental evidence of the fact, except in the case of the Kangaroos and Potoroos (Macropus and Hypsiprymnus). The analogy, however, seemed to be sufficient to justify the generalisation that the Marsupial differed from the Placental Diphyodont mam- mals in having four true molars, i. c, m. 4—4 4—4 3—3 instead of m. r—- ; and also that the)' differed in Inning only three premolars, i. s. p. - Tom. iii.

The probably marsupial Thyld- cotherium or Amphitherium from the Oxford oolites —the most ancient of all known mam- mals— had as many as twelve teeth in each molar series, besides a canine and three incisors, and by their form I have grouped . 3—3 1 — 1 6—6 6—6 them as: *. —, c. —, p. —, m. — .* An interesting field of observation still re- mains open in regard to the period and order of developement of the deciduous and permanent teeth, in the different carnivorous, omnivorous, insectivorous, and frugivorous Marsupials. At present I have ascertained the required facts only in the herbivorous family (Poep/iaga). The permanent dental formula of both the Macropodid<z and Hypsiprymnidce is, i. j—jr 1 — 1 4—4 = 30. The canines, c-^T0'^-T=T'W-4=4 which are confined to the upper jaw, are small or minute when retained ; and disappear after being represented " en germe" in most of the true kangaroos. The deciduous dentition of the great Kan- ,. v . . 3—3 1 — 1 garoo {Macropus major) is, 2—2 1 — 1 0—0" ire rudimental, 18. The canii and are absorbed rather than shed. The deciduous incisors are shed before the young animal finally quits the pouch : when this takes place, the dentition is : — 1—1 2—2 the upper incisors being i. 1, the molars </. 3 and d. 4 of the typical dentition. This stase is exemplified in the lower jaw at a, Jig. 594. The next stage shows the acquisition of i. 2 in the upper jaw, and m. 1 in both jaws, and the formula is: — = 18.

The next stage is the shedding of d. 3, and the acquisition of m. 3 (d, Jig. 594.). Then d. 4 is shed by the ascent of p. 4 into its place (e, Jig. 594.). Afterwards m. 4 is acquired, and, in the Macropus gigas, p. 4 is simultaneously pushed out {y,fig. 594.). Thus, four individuals of this species may be found to have the same number of molars, 4, 4, i. e. ; two of these may seem, on a cur- 4—4 ' sory comparison, to have them of the same shape, e.g., like C and E, Jig. 594.; or like t> and f. In fact, to determine the identity or difference in such instances, it requires that the substance of the jaws be examined to see if the germs of successional teeth he present, as at p. 4, c and d, or at m. 4, E. The result of such examination may be to show that not one of the four kangaroos with 4—4 the in. had the same or homolosous 4—4 0 teeth. The four grinders, e.g., may be — d. 3, d. 4, m. 1, vi. 2 ; as in c : or, d. 4, in. ]. m. 2, m. 3 ; as in d : or, p. 4, m. I, m. 2, m. 3 ; as in e : or, m. 1, m. 2, m. 3, and m. 4 ; as in F. But the change does not stop here : as age advances, m. 1 is shed, and the molar series is reduced numerically to the condition of b ; but, instead of m. 1, d. 4, and d. 3, it consists of m. 2, m. 3, m. 4. Finally, m. 2 is shed, and the dentition is re- duced to the same numerical state as at a, Jig. 594.: the teeth, however, being m. 3 and m. 4. The order here described is not precisely that which is followed in some of the smaller species of kangaroo. In Macropus Bcnettii, e. g., the acquisition of m. 3 is not accom- panied by the shedding of d. 3, but the molar 5 5 series is numerically -—-r : so, likewise, in this species, the acquisition of m. 4 is not accompanied by the displacement of p. 4 ; 5 5 and a molar series of is long retained ; 5—5 but, at the earlier period cited, the teeth are :—• d. 3, d. 4, m. 1, m. 2, and m. 4: and, at the later period, they are: — p. 4, vi. 1, in. 2, 7>i. 3, and m. 4. These symbols, it is hoped, are so plain and simple as to have formed no obstacle to the full and easy comprehension of the facts explained by means of them. Had those facts been described in the ordinary way, by means of verbal phrases or definitions of the teeth, — e.g., "the second deciduous molar, representing the fourth in the typical den- tition," instead of d. 4, and so on,—the de- scription would have occupied much more space, and have levied such a tax upon the attention and memory, as must have tended to enfeeble the judgment, and impair the power of seizing and appreciating the results of the comparisons. Each year's experience strengthens my conviction that the rapid and successful pro- gress of the knowledge of animal struc- tures, and of the generalisations deducible therefrom, will be mainly influenced by the determination of the nature or homology of the parts, and by the concomitant power of condensing the propositions relating to them, and of attaching to them signs or sym- bols, equivalent to their single substantive names. In my work on the " Archetype of the Skeleton," I have denoted most of the bones by simple numerals, which, if generally adopted, might take the place of names; and all the propositions respecting the centrum of the occipital vertebra might be predicated of 1 as intelligibly as of " basioccipital." The symbols of the teeth are fewer, are easily understood and remembered, render unnecessary the endless repetition of the ver- bal definition of the parts, harmonize con- flicting synonyms, serve as a universal language, and express the author's meaning in the fewest and clearest terms. The entomologist has long found the advantage of such signs as $ and J , signifying male and female, and the like ; and it is time that the anatomist should avail himself of this powerful instrument of thought, instruction, and discovery, from which the chemist, the astronomer, and the mathematician have obtained such important results. (R. Owen.) TEMPERAMENT. Although all indivi- duals of the same species are composed of the same tissues, consisting of the same elements both proximate and ultimate, and agreeing in all essential points of chemical constitution, yet there exist between certain groups of them, sometimes in the most striking degree, differences not only in the pkysical powers and actions of their frames, but also in their mental qualities. These differences are refer- rible only to peculiarities in the constitution of an individual, or in other words, to pecu- liarities in the quality of his solids and fluids, which are of a nature so recondite that we cannot detect them by any chemical or ana- tomical means, and we appreciate them only by the character with which they impress the physical and, to a certain extent, mental actions of the individual in which they exist. To ex- press this character in one word physiologists employ the term temperament. The use of this word is of very ancient date. We trace it as far back as the time of Galen, who broached the doctrine that the blood consisted of four humours, correspond- ing to the four elements; these were respec- tively designated bMis, sanguis, atra bilis, phlegma. Nunc, says Haller, ex ejusmodi quatuor humoribus sanguinem aiebant tempc- rari, justamque omnium principiorum cominis- tionem perfectissimum tcmpcramentum efficere; si vero aut sanguis supra legitimam suam quasi dosin abundaret, sive bilis, sive terra atrave bilis, sive phlegma, quatuor tune sim- plicia et praecipua temperamenta aiebant oriri, a bilis abundantia cholericum, ah aquas uber- tate pldcgmaticum, a sanguinis aucta portionc,TEMPERAMENT. 936 sanguineum, et denique a copia atrae bilis me- lancholicum* This view of the doctrine of temperaments prevailed in the schools down to the time of Cullen, and we find that able and thoughtful physician thus expressing himself upon the subject : " The ancients very early established a distinction of temperaments which the schools of physic have almost universally adopted ever since, and appears to me to be founded on observation. I am very much of opinion, that we can perceive a combination of a particular state of the chief circumstances of the economy to take place very steadily in certain persons, and thereby to form at least two of the temperaments assigned by the an- cients." f The temperaments, the existence of which seems most consistent with observation, are those admitted by Cullen, namely, the sanguis- neons and the melancholic, the phlegmatic being a degree or modification of the sanguineous, and the choleric of the melancholic. It is reasonable to expect an infinite variety as regards the extent to which the character- istic marks of the temperaments are manifested in \arious individuals. Taking examples which afford good indications, the two temperaments above referred to may be described as follows, after Cullen. Individuals of the sanguine temperament have the quantity of fluids in the body large in proportion to the solids, the habit of body soft and plump, after the period of manhood disposed to obesity, and at all times, readily sweating upon exercise, the skin smooth and white, the hair soft, generally of a pale colour or from thence passing through different shades to a red ; the complexion ruddy, the eyes com- monly blue; the strength of the whole body is moderate, and the mind sensible, irritable, cheerful, and unsteady. The most exquisite examples of this temperament are found in men from the time of puberty to that of man- hood, and in women. In both sexes the cha- racteristics of the temperaments are far less manifest in old age. In persons of the melancholic temperament the habit of the body is rather hard and mea- gre, the quantity of fluids in the whole system moderate in proportion to the solids, the sim- ple solids firm and dense, the hair hard, black, with a tendency to curl, the skin coarse, of a dun colour, with a corresponding complexion, the eyes very constantly black, the strength considerable, the mind slow, disposed to gra- vity, caution and timidity, with little sensibi- lity or irritability, but tenacious of all emotions once excited, and therefore of great steadiness. This temperament is most completely formed in advanced life, but the characters of it ap- pear often very early.\ By some writers a nervous temperament is admitted, the prominent characteristic of which consists in a great excitability of the nervous system, and a predominance of * Iialler, El. Physiolog. lib. v. sect. 4. t Mat. Med. X Cullen, loc. cit. emotional impulses over the influence of the will. Individuals of this temperament are generally fidgetty and restless, take but little sleep, and are anxious about trifles; they are called " creatures of impulse ;" their emotions are easily excited, and often not readily sub- dued. In persons of this temperament, when labouring under disease, phenomena referrible to the nervous system are very apt to compli- cate and often to obscure the morbid actions. This temperament, however, cannot be said to exist apart from the sanguineous or me- lancholic : it always accompanies either one or the other, most frequently the former, and the most exquisite examples of it are found in the female sex. In looking at the physical conditions of the best-marked examples of the sanguine and melancholic temperaments, it is im- portant to ascertain whether any one pro- perty or quality stands out more prominently than the rest, which might seem to give to the whole economy of the individuals its peculiar cast. It appears to me that there is no single physical property which is so closely associated with difference of temperament as variety in the quantity, and perhaps also in the kind, of colouring matter or pigment, evinced by the colour of the hair and skin, and influ- encing also the colour of the eyes, and of the blood, and of the nervous centres. Individuals of the melancholic temperament exhibit in their various tissues a considerable amount of pigment, as shown by the dark co- lour, generally black, of the hair and eyes, while on the other hand those of the san- guine temperament are deficient in colour, having light hair, blue or grey eyes, and fair or white skins. Observations are yet wanting, in sufficient number, to determine the relative amount of colouring matter in the blood of individuals of each of these temperaments, or to ascertain whether it is characterised by any peculiar chemical qualities. It seems highly probable that the amount and kind of colouring nutter in the skin, hair, and eyes, as well as of that in some of the secretions, as bile, urine, &c. is influenced by the amount and kind of the hsematine. The xanthous and leucous races of man in- habiting for the most part cold or temperate climates, afford the most numerous examples of the sanguine temperament, while the me- lano-comous or dark races found chiefly in warm climates are mostly of the melancholic temperament. And those individuals of the xanthous and leucous races, which in physical characters approach most nearly to the dark races, as by the existence of a large quantity of dark pigment in their tegumentary tissues, are of the melancholic temperament, whilst the light-coloured members of the xanthous races are prone to exhibit the characters of the sanguine temperament. If it be admitted that a constant connection exists between colour and temperament, as I think is sufficiently obvious, it would follow that the nature of the temperament is deter- mined by certain peculiarities in the physicalTEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. 937 condition of the frame. These peculiarities react to a certain extent upon the mind, and more or less aid or clog its workings, but cer- tain powers and modes of action of the mind are by no means so constantly associated with certain states of body, as to connect the men- tal and bodily states as cause and effect. It is true that the sanguine temperament is ge- nerally accompanied by a mind exhibiting certain characters, but the exceptions to this are so numerous that we cannot assign the corporeal state as the cause of the mental — nor vice versa. Bodily peculiarities are in- finitely more frequently inherited than mental, — the powers and activity of the mind are greatly determined by education and training; but those qualities of body which give a cha- racter to its temperament are born with it; and although they may be modified by exter- nal influences, they are yet at all times suf- ficiently distinct to prove them to be inherent physical properties of the entire organism. At the same time it seems reasonable to admit that the mind has its temperaments, as the body has, and in a great measure inde- pendently, and the terms, sanguine, melan- cholic, phlegmatic, and choleric, may be severally applied to them, according as the emotions and feelings, and the intellectual actions vary in their modes and degrees of developement, and in their rate of working. (R. B. Todd.) TEMPORO-M AXILLARY ARTICU- LATION.—Under this heading I propose to give a brief account of the jointing of the lower maxilla to the cranium. This joint can- not, of course, be identified out of the verte- bruta. The mandibles and maxillae of the ar- ticulata are not homologous with the jaws of vertebrate animals, and the slit of their mouths is placed vertically not horizontally. In the human subject, as in all mammalia, this articulation takes place between the squamous portion of the temporal (squamosal) and the inferior maxillary bones. The description of the anatomy of the human temporo-maxillary joint comprises, therefore, that of the diarthro- dial articular surfaces of those bones, and also of the following parts : viz., the interarticuiar fibro-cartilage, the two synovial sacs, the ex- ternal and internal lateral and other liga- ments, and part of the insertion of the external pterygoid muscle. Bones. — The articular condyle of the lower jaw is sub-cylindroid in form, its length from side to side being greater than its antero-pos- terior measurement. The axis of this cjlinder, however, is set neither directly from side to side, nor yet exactly level, its inner part being posterior to and below its outer; so that if the axes of the two condyles were produced inwards till they met, they would form an angle in doing so, which would point down- wards and backwards, — reaching the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. The carti- lage that encrusts this condyle extends further down behind than in front. The surface to which this condyle is (mediately) articulated forms a part of the glenoid fossa, and is situated just below the base of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, between its roots. It has such form as, in respect of the set of its axis, and its tranverse measurement, pretty accurately fits the condyle. It has, however, a greater antero-posterior extent, in accordance with the capability which this joint normally pos- sesses, in addition to the usual ginglymoid motion, of an antero-posterior gliding to and fro of the condyle — a kind of normal disloca- tion. The glenoid fossa of the temporal bone contains a portion of the parotid gland, as well as the condyle of the inferior maxilla ; the former occupies that portion of it which is posterior to the glasserian fissure, whilst that part which is anterior to the glasserian fissure, is lined with cartilage for the articulation of the latter. In man there is usually no bony ridge bounding this articular surface pos- teriorly, such as is generally found in the lower mammalia. The ridge that bounds it anteriorly is formed by the inferior root of the zygoma, and the cartilage is continued some way on to this ridge. Externally it is limited by a tubercle on the zygoma, which serves for the attach- ment of the external lateral ligament of the joint. Interarticuiar fibro cartilage. — This is a thin disc or meniscus, oval or sub-oblon? in form, concave below and convex above, thus capping the condyle, thicker at the edges than in the middle, where it is not unfrequently thinned away even to perforation. It differs from all the other fibro-cartilages in having muscular fibres inserted into it; namely, a portion of those of the external pterygoid. This insertion takes place along its anterior border, and by it the fibro-cartilage is made to join in that normal amount of dislocation for- wards, which as above stated, the condyle of the lower maxilla is capable of, as well as in the abnormal accidental dislocation of the jaw. It is further held in its place by the fibres of the external lateral ligament, and by the synovial bursa; of the joint. Synovial Bursa.— These are two in num- ber, one above the interarticuiar fibro-carti- lage and the other below it. The upper one is the larger and slacker, for it alone is con- cerned in the antero-posterior gliding of the joint. The two sacs, of course, communicate and are reduced to one when the interarti- cuiar fibro-cartilage is perforated in the centre. Ligaments.—There is only one ligament in immediate relation with the temporo-maxil- lary joint, namely, the external lateral. This is a small ligament, broader above than below, situated at the outside of the joint; attached above to the tubercle situated at the point of divergence of the roots of the zygoma ; and directed downwards and backwards to the outside of the neck that supports the condyle of the lower jaw. Midway in its passage from the one to the other it is attached by its inner aspect to the interarticuiar fibro-cartilage.TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. 938 The internal lateral ligament is a long thin slip extending from the spinous process of the sphenoid, and the neighbouring parts of the temporal bone to the fore part of the lip of the inferior dental canal. It lies behind the external pterygoid muscle, by the origin of which its cranial attachment is concealed, and it is separated from the temporo-maxillary joint by a considerable space through which pass the internal maxillary artery and vein, giving off' their middle meningeal and inferior dental branches, which indeed are conducted, the former to the foramen spinosum of the sphe- noid, the latter to the inferior dental canal, by the ligament in question. Numerous stray fibres of ligamentous tissue strengthen the synovial sacs of the temporo- maxillary joint, forming a kind of capsular ligament. That process of the cervical fascia, which is called the stylo-maxillary ligament, is gene- rally enumerated as one of the ligaments of this joint. It extends from the styloid process to the lower part of the ramus of the jaw, separating the parotid from the submaxillary gland, and affording attachment to the stylo- glossus muscle. The condyle of the lower jaw depends for the maintenance of its normal apposition to the temporal bone much more upon the masseter, temporal and pterygoid muscles than upon these small ligaments ; by these, however, its astero-posterior gliding is indifferently tethered. Muscles. — The external pterygoid-muscle, proceeding backwards and outwards from its origin, is mainly inserted into the front of the neck that supports the maxillary condyle, the upper part of it, however, is inserted into the interarticular fibro-cartilage, which thereby is drawn forward along with the condyle when ■this muscle acts. This insertion is tendinous. Motions of the jpint.— The temporo-maxil- lary joint admits of a ginglymoid motion in the vertical direction, by which the mouth is opened and shut. This motion must of ne- cessity always take place in the joints of both sides at the same instant. It also admits of a horizontal antero-posterior gliding motion, in which the joint of one side only may be mainly concerned. In the human subject the front teeth of the lower jaw, in most cases, are not ex- actly opposed to those of the upper jaw—that is, the summits of the one set are not applied to the summits of the other — in the ordinary position of the mouth, either when at rest or engaged in mastication. The lower incisor teeth are usually posterior to the upper. But when we bite with the front teeth we bring the upper and lower set into apposition by thrusting forward the lower jaw : in this act both joints are similarly concerned. We can also execute a grinding motion from side to side, and this is done by thrusting forward one condyle whilst the other merely revolves on the axis of its neck. The jaw is elevated or closed by the tem- poral, masseter, and pterygoid muscles. The pterygoid, chiefly the external, are the agents in protruding it. These latter are antagonised by the elevating and also by the depressing muscles. The chief depressor of the lower jaw is the digastric, as is clearly shown by its comparative anatomy, but all those which ex- tend from the chin to the hyoid bone are capable of, and occasionally do assist in per- forming this act. The majority of the muscular fibres that elevate the jaw arrive at their insertion into it from before backwards ; thus the masseter has a kind of twist in the arrangement of its fibres, so that those which arise most anteriorly are inserted very conspicuously furthest back, whilst the remainder proceed directly downwards or slightly forwards ; a considerable portion of those of the temporal, namely, those which arise from the anterior part of the temporal fossa, run backwards to their insertion into the coronoid process. The use of this arrangement seems, upon a careful consideration of the mechanics of the question, to be the application of the elevating or closing force in a more favourable direc- tion, not, as might seem at first sight, the protrusion of the lower jaw — that is amply effected by the pterygoideus externus. Abnormal conditions of the temporo- maxillary joint.—Accidents.— The condyle of the lower jaw can only be dislocated in one direction, namely forwards. In this accident the condyle slips forward over the inferior root of the zygoma, and is then drawn somewhat upwards within the zygomatic arch. The inter- articular cartilage is carried with it. Thisusually happens to the joints of both sides, but occa- sionally one condyle only is dislocated. It is usually produced by the action of the muscles when the mouth is very widely opened, as in yawning, or more especially in biting a very large object, such as a large apple. When both the condyles are dislocated, the lower jaw is thrust forwards and cannot be re- tracted. The mouth is widely open and the patient is unable to close it. The power of swallowing is lost, and the saliva, the secretion of which is probably increased, flows from the mouth involuntarily. Articulation is difficult, owing to the impossibility of making the labial sounds. There is a conspicuous depression beneath the zygoma just in front of the ear, and a flatness in the masseteric region. The coronoid process is much depressed, and forms a visible protuberance beneath the zygoma, and, as first observed by Mr. Adams of Dub- lin, there is a prominence in the temporal re- gion between the eyebrow and the ear, pro- duced by the posterior fibres of the temporal muscle being pushed up by the condyle in its new position. If this dislocation remains unreduced, the parts, as in most other dislocations, gradually accommodate themselves to their new position, so that the pow er of articulation and deglu- tition is re-acquired, the mouth can be closed, and a considerable amount of motion is re- gained, but the chin remains abnormally thrust forwards, and there is always a depression in the position normally occupied by the con- dyle.939 TEMPORO-MAXILLARY articulation. When one condyle only is dislocated, the chin is thrust forwards and towards one side —that, namely, on which the condyle remains in place. The coronoid process of the dis- located side forms a prominence even more conspicuous than when both condyles are displaced, but the mouth is not so wide open. There is, of course, the same depression in front of the ear, and the same flatness of the masseteric region. Congenital malformation. Dr. R. W. Smith of Dublin, in his Treatise on Fractures and Dislocations,* gives a detailed account of the dissection of a highly interesting case of " Con- genital luxation of the inferior maxilla." The malformation affected one side only, — the right,— and consisted mainly of an absence, or arrest of development of the condyle, the only vestige of which was a small process hooked inwards at its apex. This process did not touch the temporal bone by a quarter of an inch, and neither it nor the surface oppo- site to it presented any articular cartilage, but were both simply invested with periosteum. There was no trace of an interarticular fibro- cartilage, nor of a synovial sac, and the ex- ternal lateral ligament sloped downwards and forwards instead of downwards and backwards. The glenoid cavity did not exist, or rather the inferior root of the zygoma, which really forms the glenoid cavity, was not developed. There was conspicuous atrophy of the whole of this side of the face in respect of the bones — temporal, right half of the body and right ramus of the inferior maxilla, malar, su- perior maxillary, and even the right half of the sphenoid, — and muscles, but the nerves were as large as their fellows. The most re- markable of the peculiarities of the surround- ing parts, and that which clearly demonstrated the abnormal condition not to be the result of injury or disease, was an extreme shortness of the zygomatic process of the the temporal and a compensatory unusual length of that of the malar bone. The former was only half an inch long, whilst the latter was nearly twice as long as that of the other side. During the lifetime of this patient, who was an idiot, it was observed that one side of his countenance did not match the other, and that the dis- parity was much increased when he opened his mouth. He was often observed to have spasmodic twitching of the abnormal side of his face. Disease. — Chronic rheumatic arthritis occa- sionally affects this articulation. Both joints are usually affected by it, but sometimes it attacks the joint of one side only. It is most common in elderly subjects. When it attacks the young or middle aged, it is more rapid, accompanied with more pain, and more likely to involve the neck of the condyle and the ramus of the jaw. The pain is often very severe but varia- ble, apparently influenced by meteorological changes. The lymphatic glands in the neigh- bourhood of the diseased joint are much prone * A Treatise on Fractures in the Vicinity of Joints and on Certain Forms of accidental and congenital Dislocations. Dublin, 1847. 8vo. to enlargement; and sometimes the enlarged condyle can be felt as a bony tumour just in front of the ear. The chin is thrust forward, mesially when both joints are affected, and towards the healthy side, as well as forwards, when only one is diseased. The motion of the jaw is considerably impaired. On dissection, the condyle, in cases of this affection, is gen- erally found to be large and broad, but some- times conical, rough, and devoid of cartilage. Ivory or porcellanous deposit, so common in other joints when affected with chronic rheu- matic arthritis, is but rarely met witli in this; those abnormal ossific concretions in and around the joints, which are so constantly met with in the disease in question in other situations, have also never been found in the temporo-maxillary joint. The interarticular fibro-cartilage had disappeared in every case of this affection which has been dissected and published. The glenoid cavity is enlarged, divested of its articular cartilage, and presents a roughened, abnormal surface. All indica- tion of the disease stops suddenly at the glas- serian fissure, and at the spheno-temporal suture, and the enlargement of the glenoid cavity takes place at the expense of the lower root of the zygoma which generally becomes entirely absorbed. In the report of the proceedings of the Pathological Socety of London in the Medical Gazette of November 30. 1849, there is an account of a highly interesting case of necrosis of the condyle, back part of the ramus, and angle of the lower jaw in a scrofulous boy. The portion of necrosed bone, which was ex- hibited to the society, was removed many years before, by Mr. Keate, who also had examined the patient, grown to a healthy man, two years before the date of the com- munication. As far as could be ascertained by external investigation, the lost portion of bone had been perfectly restored. There was no deformity, and no impairment of motion. There are two other similar cases on record ; one by Desault, in which the whole ramus, with the condyle and coronoid process, were removed, the other by Mr. Syme, in which the condyle and ramus were necrosed. In both these cases, also, the lost bone was per- fectly restored to all external appearance, but there is no record of a dissection of such a case. In some cases which are on record, where the whole of the lower jaw, with both its condyles, has been removed, its place has been supplied by condensed fibrous tissue, but there has been no reproduction of bone. Anchylosis of the temporo-maxillary joint is a very rare occurrence. There is, however, one specimen of it in the Pathological series of the Museum of the London College of Surgeons. The fusion of the two bones is complete, as is shown in the preparation by a vertical, side to side, section through the situation of the quondam joint. This section shows that a perfectly normal-looking cancel- lous structure, shelled over by a layer of dense osseous tissue, is continued from the temporal to the inferior maxillary bone, and exhibits no940 TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. manner of trace to indicate where the joint once was. In fact this anchylosis had existed for fifty years before the death of the patient. No record is preserved of the cause of it. The joint of one side only is anchylosed, but that of the other side is much altered in form. An abnormal tubercle of bone projects down- wards from the middle of the glenoid cavity and is received into an abnormal excavation or alveolus in the middle of the condyle. The lower jaw is much wasted in size, and has lost all its teeth save the two front incisors. The upper jaw bones are thin and light. The motion of the lower jaw is often lost owing to an affection not immediately con- nected with the joint itself. When, as often happens in scarlatina, cancrum oris, &c. there is extensive sloughing of the inside of the cheeks, the cicatrices resulting from the heal- ing of the great wounds contract, and form bands, extending from the upper to the lower jaw, so strong and unyielding that the muscles which open the mouth are unable to antago- nise them. Comparative Anatomy.—If a palaeonto- logist were asked what fragment of a verte- brate skeleton, speaking generally for all ver- tebrata, would give him most information as to the status and affinities of the animal to which it belonged, he would most probably answer — the articular portion of the lower jaw or the articulation that receives it. Of the convex and concave surfaces which go to form this articulation, in all the mammalia the convexity is on the inferior maxilla, and the concavity on the squamosal bone, whilst in the three other vertebrate classes the re- verse is invariably the case — the concavity is on the inferior maxilla, the convexity on the bone that articulates with it. The under jaw does not articulate with the same, or to speak more accurately, with the homologous bone in all vertebrate animals. In all the mammalia it articulates, as in man, with the squamous element of the temporal •— the squamosal bone. In birds, reptiles, and osseous fishes it articulates with bones which are clearly the special homologues of the tym- panic ring of the human subject. In cartila- ginous fishes its articulation is with the ptery- goid bone, the hoinologue of the human internal pterygoid plate. The Lepidosiren, in which so many other characters of the osseous and cartilaginous fishes are so curi- ously blended together, in strict accord with this circumstance, presents an instance of the pterygoid and tympanic bones contributing each a part — the former the inner, the latter the outer part, of the articular surface for the reception of the lower jaw.* It is well worth while to stop here and review what is stated in the two preceding paragraphs. What is said is, really, this ; — every animal that suckles its young has a convex articular surface to its lower jaw, whilst every vertebrate that lays eggs has a concave sur- face. Or this—every vertebrate animal that * Owen. has hair upon it, that has a diaphragm, or an epiglottis, has a convex articular surface to its lower maxilla, whilst all vertebrates that are destitute of these have a concave surface. Or, again, all animals that suckle their young, and have diaphragms, hair, and epiglottides, present their squamosal bones for the articu- lation of their inferior maxillae, whilst all in which the possession of these characters is negatived present for this articulation their tympanic, or, rarely, their pterygoid bones. Can any physiological reason be assigned for this ? Can any final purpose, holding good in all, or in the majority of, instances, be shown to be served by this difference ? I think none can. One cannot conceive but that it is a matter of perfect indifference whether the convexity is on this bone or that. Let us look once more to the facts. The bat that flies, but not the swallow, the whale that swims but not the cod-fish, the camel that walks the desert, but not the ostrich, the carnivorous lion, seal, and weasel, but not the eagle, penguin, crocodile, and shark, have convex articulations to their lower jaw and present to them their squamosal bones. Here then is a caveat for the physiologist. A character found in an animal may have no physiological signification,—no relation to external circum- stances, nor even a functional connexion with, or dependence on other characters wherewith it coexists, perhaps invariably. It may be due to the status only of the animal. Physiolo- gically independent it may exist in an animal only because other independent characters co-exist. It may be a Syneilogy, not a Teleo- logy. That certain independent characters in- variably go together, which was so elaborately illustrated by Cuvier, is a fact of a high order, perhaps the twilight of some great truth. If future investigations should prove that truth to be progressive developement, towards which hypothesis the inquirer is, even now, tempted by so many striking facts, as well as by the admirable use that can be made of it as a scaffold theory, then we should say, and as making use of a scaffolding we may say it now, that certain characters are attained to at a cer- tain stage in the chain of development, and, therefore, those are found coexisting which are proper to the degree of development to which the animal has arrived. Such characters I have been accustomed to call Syneilogies *, a word which at all events has the merit of re- ferring only to a well known fact, without in- volving any hypothesis. To the palaeontologist this " correlation of independent characters " f is, of course, invaluable, and for the purpose of arranging natural groups in the animal kingdom, these, so to speak, useless,or Syneilogical, cha- racters are immeasurably more valuable than those modifications to meet special exigencies which are called teleologies. Mammalia. — In all mammalia, except man, the articular surface on the squamosal bone is bounded posteriorly, or, in the rodents, inter- * o-'vv, Ei/Ui, \oyt><;. f Cuvier.911 TEMPORO-M AXILLARY ARTICULATION. rally, by a prominent ridge or process. This is the case in the higher Quadrumana, and there is an indication of it even in the lower races of mankind. In the Carnivora the con- dyle is in general extremely long, cylindroid, and its length is set, almost or quite directly from side to side, whilst the surface to which it is opposed is bounded by a very salient ridge fore and aft. This condition attains its acme in the Badger, where the salient ridges, especially the posterior, even arch over and surround the cylindroid condyle so much, that in the dry skull the lower jaw remains at- tached to the cranium without any artificial contrivance, and can be removed only by slipping each half out sideways when the sym- physis has been disjoined. Witli such a joint there cannot, of course, be the usual lateral motion of the jaw. In the Rodentia, on the contrary, the long diameter of the con- dyle is directed antero-posteriorly, and is ad- apted to an antero-posterior groove, mostly bounded, internally and externally, by salient ridges. Hence that nibbling, antero-posterior motion of the jaw, which is so conspicuous in these animals, and with which their teeth and masticatory muscles are in such admirable relation. This only holds good in respect of the placental rodents. In that great marsupial rodent, the Wombat, the saliently arched, cylindroid condyles have the usual side to si le and converging-behind set of their long diameters. The articular surface which is opposed to this condyle is placed, as in the placental rodents, on the zygomatic process, which in both runs almost directly outwards; instead, however, of being an antero-posterior groove it is a transverse convex cylindroid, describing a retreating curve ; so that in the tcmporo-maxillary joint of the wombat a cylin- droid ridge is opposed to another cylindroid ridge, the one describing a salient, the other a retreating arch.* The articular facets of the tetnporo-maxillary joint in the Ruminantia approach more nearly to plane surfaces than in any other animals. The squamosal facet is bounded by a ridge posteriorly, but has no bony limitation in front. This is in re- lation with the extensive lateral movement of the jaw which these animals use in chew- ing the cud, and with the limited power of gaping which they possess. The rest of the mammalia present varieties in this joint w hich are extremely interesting, but an account of them would occupy more space than the limits of this work permit. Aves.— In birds, as above stated, the arti- cular surface of the lower mandible is con- cave, and is adapted to the tympanic bone, or, as the older ornithologists called it, the os quadratum.f The articular surface of the lower jaw presents two concave depressions. The tympanic bone is itself moveable, being articulated to the cranium by two diarthrodial joints, so that a bird's lower jaw is swung to the head by two moveable jointings. * See Art. Marsupialia, tig. 94. t See Art. AviiS. Rcptilia. — The evenly concave articular surface of a reptile's lower jaw is often con- tributed to by more than one of the osseous pieces which compose the inferior maxilla of the oviparous vertebrates. In the crocodile by two, in some chelonia by three of these pieces. The tympanic bone is articulated with the other cranial bones by suture, anil is therefore immoveable, in the Crocodilia and Chelonia, but it is articulated with them by diarthrosis, and therefore moveable, in the Lacertia, Opliidia, and Balrachia. In some ophidia, as the Python, there being, properly speaking, no symphysis of the lower jaw, but instead of it an elastic ligament, holding the two halves together at the chin, one temporo- maxillary joint is capable of movement inde- pendently of the other. In the Batrachia, among their many fish-like characters is that of a dismemberment of the tympanic bone, which consists of an upper and a lower piece. Pisces. — In the majority of fishes, the tympanic bone is represented by four separate pieces called epi-, hypo-, meso-, and prae- tympanic bones. These, further, bear upon their posterior edge three opercular bones, which were considered by Geoffroy St. Hilaire to be the homologues of the ossicula auditus, but are regarded by Prof. Owen as append- ages, serially homologous with the costal appendages. The uppermost piece, the epi- tympanic, articulates by a diarthrodial joint with the mastoid, and the lowermost, hypo- tympanic, presents a diarthrodial convexity to the lower jaw. The four tympanic pieces arti- culate with one another, and with the oper- cular bones by the interposition of ligament, or rather membrane, connecting their thin ad- jacent edges together, so that the whole appa- ratus is capable of bilging outwards in the movements of respiration. In the eel tribe (Mtincnidce) the number of tympanic bones is reduced to three, which is obviously an approach towards the two tympanic pieces of the Batrachia. The formation of the cranial part of the joint in question by the pterygoid and tympanic bones conjointly, in the Lepido- siren has been mentioned above. In the Sharks and Rays the tympanic pedicle descends upon that part of the pterygoid which forms the joint, but does not actually reach the articula- tion, the pterygoid being interposed. In these fishes, the super-maxillary and pterygoid pieces being confluent, and both bearing teeth, it ap- pears at first sight that the whole upper jaw is formed by the former alone, consequently that the inferior maxilla is articulated directly with the super-maxillary ; such an articulation, however, never takes place in any animal. The inlerarticular fibro-cartilage is con- stantly met with in Mammalia, but in neither of the other vertebrate classes. Homology of the joint. — The joint in ques- tion is the articulation between the pleura- pophysis and the hamapopliysis of the frontal vertebra. It is therefore serially homologous with the joint between the rib and the costal cartilage of mammalia, or the vertebral and sternal ribs of birds and reptiles.TERATOLOGY. 942 The joints connected with the maxillary apparatus of some of the animals belonging to the three lower sub-kingdoms are, as was stated in the beginning, not homologous with this joint, although identical in function. For description of these parts see the articles Annelida, Arachnida, Cephalopoda, Cir- riiopeda, Crustacea, Eciiinodermata, Entozoa, Insecta, Myriapoda, and Roti- fkra. (S. Ii. Pittard.) TERATOLOGY. — Under this name, which we owe to Geoffroy St. Hilaire, we un- derstand the doctrine of congenital deformi- ties* In a scientific sense, it constitutes a part of Pathological Anatomy, and demands our interest as much as the knowledge of those other deviations from the normal state, which is ordinarily regarded as constituting that science. In fact, pathological anatomy comprises all the anomalies of the organiza- tion ; those which occur during intra-uterine life are called congenital, and those which arise during extra-uterine life acquired. We refer to the former the imperfections of the primitive formation, or what we call mon- strosities. They are those deviations of the organism which can be formed only in the earliest periods of gestation, or, at least, pre- viously to the teumination of the feetal con- dition. The opinions now held with respect to these malformations differ widely from the absurd notions which influence the descrip- tions given of them by Aldrovandi, Ambrose Pare, Licetus, Palfin, and Rueff. Formerly, indeed, each monstrosity was considered as the presage of some misfortune, the warrant of divine vengeance, the effect of witchcraft, &c. Lycosthenes used to go so far as to add to the description of each monster the picture of some calamity which was to be its sequel. To that opinion they owe their name, derived from the Latin verb monstrare. Their aetiology was not less strange and in- correct. Rueff, in 1580, devoted a whole chapter to the inquiry, " An homines ex dse- monibus et rursus daemones ex hominibus in- fantes concipere possunt?" and Casparus Schottus treated the subject in about the same style.f They both give negative answers to the ques- tion, trusting to have proved by this means that monsters are not procreated by sexual intercourse of women with the devil. Other writers have endeavoured to explain the cause from copulation with brute animals, or with pregnant or menstruating women. Notwith- standing our more enlightened modern ideas on this subject, the origin of monstrous births remains still very mysterious. The opinions concerning it may be reduced to two main * From monster; and ^w>s, science. + I. Rueffus de Conceptu et Generatione Hominis. Francof ad M. 1580. P. Casparus Schottus e Societate Jesu, Physica curiosa, aucta et eovrccta, sive Mirabilia Naturae et Artis. Lib. i. § xxii. points: 1. To the original malformation of the germ ; 2. To the subsequent deformation of the embryo by causes operating on its development. I. Original malformation of the germ. — If, according to the opinions generally adopted at the present time, the germ may be considered as a product of secretion by the female organ- ism, upon which the male sperm acts with its material and vital influence, we may suppose that this germ may be originally malformed, owing to some influence proceeding cither from the female or from the male sex. 1. Such a primitive malformation of the germ seems to exist in those cases in which the same kind of monstrosity is repeatedly procreated by the same parents. The cause may be ascribed : — a. To the mother. — It is a very important fact that, in such cases, various degrees of the same species of deformity are fre- quently produced in successive progression, so that the first born child is the most de- formed; and in the following children the deformity progressively decreases, and finally disappears in the last born (G. Vrolik, Vering). Sometimes a deformity of the mother is com- municated to her offspring ; for instance, con- genital luxation of the fem ur. b. To the father. — Experience proves that a well-formed man may procreate with dif- ferent women children with the same mal- formation (Meckel, Luber), and that a de- formity of the father may be transmitted to the child (Burdach, Osiander). The last is however rare. 2. A second proof in support of the pro- bability of an original malformation of the germ is found in hereditary deformities ex- tending over more than one generation, viz. hare-lip, excessive number of fingers, hypo- spadias, &c. 3. A third proof may be deduced from the possibility that the ovarian ova in man and in the lower animals may be already mal- formed (Bischoff). II. Deformation of the. originally well-formed germ.— 1. It is said that this may be produced by mental impression of the pregnant woman, or what the German authors call das Versehen. But for this opinion no positive proof can be afforded. According to the observations pub- lished thereupon, and of which a great deal may be found in the learned article Generation of this Cyclopaedia, all the supposed mental impressions, which have been considered as the cause of malformations, took place, with few exceptions, in the last stage of preg- nancy.* And even in those cases in which an earlier period may be certified, we could object that the post hoc must not always lead to the conclusion ergo propter hoc. It is of some im- portance to appreciate the correctness of this * See my publications in Tijdsehrift v. Natuur- lyke geschiedenis en Physiolog-ie, d. iv. bl. 221, en tolgy. en Handb. d. Ziehtch. Ontlurh. d. i. bl. 339.94.3 TERATOLOGY. reasoning, for the theory of the mental im- pressions, which was so readily adopted in the barbarous middle ages, as a mode of saving poor and innocent women from torture and stake, finds even in the present day more ad- vocates than might have been expected. Of this I was convinced at the Congress of Naturalists at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1847, and in the Report of the Transactions of the Sckwei- zerischen Naturf. Gesellschaft zu Chur, 29, 30, 31 Juli, 1844, in which the affected mind of the pregnant woman is said to produce a mysterious effect on the foetus, and that the medium by which this influence is com- municated may be the hearing as well as the sight! To crown all these absurdities, we see mentioned in Rust, Magasin, B. xxi. S. 201., that a woman gave birth to a child with im- perfect bones, which is attributed to her having been present, before her pregnancy, at the execution of a criminal by breaking on the wheel. To all these fantastical considera- tions I oppose the following arguments : — a. That malformations seldom, or perhaps never, agree with apprehensions or fears d priori of pregnant women (G. Vrolik, T. Zimmer, J.J. Flenck, and Burdach). On the contrary, it often happens that a woman who has once procreated a malformation, and is continually troubled by the fear of another similar sad occurrence, may become the happy mother of a second well-formed child. b. That the foetus, even when a germ, is quite independent; transferred from the ovary into the uterus, it needs for its developcment a material intercourse with the maternal body, but no organic connection ; for which reason it can be formed as well without as within the uterus, as in extra-uterine pregnancy ; that it stands in no connection, either vascular or nervous, with the body of the mother, and that therefore it is improbable that her mental condition can have any influence whatever upon the form of the foetus. c. That malformations occur likewise among the inferior animals, — insects, testaceous ani- mals, echinodermata,—in which the developer ment of psychical life is very imperfect, and the oviparous generation of which must pre- serve the young from the influence of dis- ordered maternal imagination. cl. That in the case of twins, as the ace- phali specially show, one child may be mal- formed and the other in perfect condition, notwithstanding they were both exposed to the same influences. e. That more deeply situated organs, the very existence of which may be unknown to the pregnant woman, may be malformed ; as for instance, the heart, the intestinal tube, &c. If now, on all these grounds, I exclude the mental impressions of pregnant women from the aetiology of malformations, I do not mean to deny the influence which by her somatic condition the mother may exercise upon the foetus. Thus, if in consequence of mental agitation, her body were to suffer a violent shock, this might have a prejudicial influence on the material transmission which takes place between her and the foetus, and the latter might thereby become morbidly affected. There are instances ofits being the subject of intermittent fever (P. Russell) ; of sudden death occa- sioned by frightful agitation of the mother (Wienholdt) ; of jaundice communicated by the mother (Kerckring) ; of small-pox (Jen- ner, Montgomery, Friedlander) ; of syphilis and scarlet fever (R. Lee), all derived from the mother. But all this is entirely different from the effect of mental impressions. It is a material result, easily conceived, and of which physiologists need no further explanation. 2. A second cause of malformation of the foetus is sought in external injury suffered by women during their pregnancy. Meckel goes so far as to reject this entirely. In some de- formities, for instance, in hydrops ventriculo- rum cerebri, the effect of external injury is easily proved. 3. A third cause is attributed to diseases of the ovurn and of the foetus. Simpson (Edinburgh Med. and Surg. Journal, No. 127., April, 1836, and Gazette Medicale de Paris, Nov. 183G, p. 393.) has described an acute and chronic form of placentitis, to which ought to be ascribed all those singular ex- udations which attach themselves to the foetus as pseudo-membranes. Fig. 595. gives a spe- cimen of adhesion of the placenta to the head of a foetus deformed by urania. Fig. 595. Ectopia cordis and adliesion of the Placenta. In fig. 59G. a pseudo-membrane passes toTERATOLOGY. the forehead, round which is twisted the um- bilical cord. Fig. 596. In some, but very rare, cases, the coats of the ovum are destroyed, and the fetus is im- mediately attached to the inner surface of the uterus (Steinmetz). It is not to be denied, that through these pseudo-membranes some mal- formations of the fetus may be occasioned, as Montgomery has proved, such as the truncation of the extremities, which he names self-ampu- tation. Further than this, however, we may net go, for the brides placcnlaires of Professor St. Hilaire are certainly not a universal cause of monstrosity. They are too accidental and unstable to be such. The existence of mal- formations in eggs which Geoff'roy St. Hilaire coated over with varnish or wax, affords no proof of the possibility of a mechanical origin of monstrosities. The exclusion of the air pre- vents, in such a case, the necessary material change in the ovum, in consequence of which the perfect developement of the fetus is im- paired. The morbid state of the coats of the ovum may likewise cause the so-called molcc, which, according to their consistency, are divided into mohs fungosa, carnoscc, cruentce, and tendinosce. Valentin* distinguishes in the san- guineous mass oi niola carnosa a net of vessels, from which the blood issues. It is the vas- cular net of the chorion, in which the mass of blood has been collected, in consequence of too great a supply from the uterus. By these means the villi are distended and removed. The ovum being thus degenerated, occasions defective respiration and nutrition of the fetus, which in consequence soon dies. The ovum, however, may still continue to grow, and is finally expelled. In this manner these molce are frequently the cause of miscarriage. * Eepert. Anat. u. Physiol., Berlin, 1837, B. i. S. 127. Kerckring* inveighed in a spirited and in- genious manner against the strange accounts which were formerly given of these moles. To the diseases of the placenta are referred enlargement (Kyll, Pierrard, Devilliers), con- gestion and apoplexy (J. Clarke, Darigan), calcareous concretions (Hannover). For the aetiology of malformations, this pathological anatomy of the placenta is, however, very un- productive. None of these can be explained by it, nor were any accompanied by these pla- cental diseases. Nor does the nosology of the fetus afford us much more information, notwithstanding the monograph given by J. Gmesser.-j- It cannot, however, be denied, that some of its diseases may give rise to deformities ; for in- stance, chronic inflammation of the brain to hi/drops ventriculdrum cerebri, and this again to Acrania. Perhaps also, as Rokitansky states, a morbid condition of the valves may be the cause of some congenital abnormities of the heart. Yet, notwithstanding all this, the diseases of the fetus can only, in a very limited sense, be assigned as the cause of its malformation ; and hence the opinion of Otto, who ascribes to this source a great many malformations, ought to be rejected. 4. A fourth, and assuredly very general, cause of malformation, consists in impeded de- velopement of the fetus by some remote and un- known cause. It is matter of dispute whether this deforming cause operates on the fetus in its totality, or whether it affects originally only one system, which spreads its deforming influence over all the others. This last idea was embraced by Tiedemann, who at first de- duced all monstrosities from some defect of the vascular, and later from the nervous system. In opposition to this hypothesis, I suggest the following considerations. a. It is opposed to anatomical evidence. The cyclopia, whose nature consists in a more or less simplified eye and a displaced or absent external nose, is attributed by Tiede- mann to the original absence of olfactory nerves, producing the deformation of the nasal cavity, and the original fusion of the optic nerves, and of the thalami nervorum opticorum effecting the simplification of the eye. I have found, however, in ci/clopes, more than once, olfactory nerves, and have likewise seen that there was no constant con- currence between the simplified form of the eye and of the optic nerve. A double optic nerve may be found with a single eye-ball (Eller, Henermann). With complete dupli- cation of the internal parts of the eye, and even with two separate eyes, I found a single optic nerve, and likewise a double, though not complete, as well as a single eye-ball, notwithstanding the entire absence of the optic nerve. Similar facts are quoted by Haller and G. F. Wolff. Hare-lip with cleft * Specil. Anat. Amstelodami, 1670, Observ. 38 et 95. t Die Krankheiten des Foetus. Breslavi, 1827. 8voTERATOLOGY. 9i5 palate is attributed by Tiedemann to the original absence of olfactory nerves. G. Vrolik found them, however, in children with hare-lip. The nerves of organs may exist, although the organs themselves may be ab- sent (Seller, W. Vrolik); and inversely, the nerves may be wanting, while the organs are present (0. G. Buttner). In anencephali the body is very massive, notwithstanding the imperfect condition of the nervous centres. In double monsters there is no definite corre- spondence between the condition of the nerv- ous system and the duplication of the body (W. Vrolik).* I). Embryogenesis teaches that the forma- tion of the several parts of the body is not essentially the result of that of the nervous system, but that, on the contrary, each part is formed and developed independently. I refer to what I have already said, in 1830 (in my treatise on Cyclopia}, and am happy to find J. Muller, Rathke, Bischoflf, Burdach, and Stannius, with me on this sul ject. What is now proved for the nervous system, may equally be applied to the system of blood- vessels; and hence I presume to conclude, that no malformation whatever proceeds from a central system, but is occasioned merely by impeded developement, the cause of which remains concealed. This impediment may be confined to one part, or may be extended over more. This extension may sometimes stand either in causal connexion with an original malformation, as for instance the dis- placing of the nose in cyclopes ; or may take place in an entirely independent manner. In the latter case, it is a complication of mal- formation, which proves that it may extend itself to more than one region of the hotly, and to more than one apparatus. I have met with an instance of this, in which to acrania, cyclopia, and absence of the lower jaw, was added ectopia of the intestines. If the origin of the malformation is derived from impeded developement, the so-called monstra per defectum are the result, and from excessive formation arise the monstra per excessum. The malformations occasioned by impeded developement may, for the most part.be com- pared with the natural forms through which the foetus passes in its normal developement. On this is founded the ingenious idea of Meckel, previously suggested by Wolff, that most malformations are caused by arrest of developement (bi/dungshemmung), for which reason they must be said, according to Bischoflf", to be formed through arrested de- velopement (liemmungsbildungcn). They, how- ever, never give us a perfect representation of the form at which the foetus has been arrested in its developement, because the in- creased growth and the progressive nutrition of the foetus cannot but make an important * On this subject I have given copious elucida- tion in the Treatise on Cyclopia in Transactions of the First Class of the Royal Netherland Institute, 1836, vol. v. p. 25.; on Double Monsters, ibid. 18-iO, vol. ix.; and Handbuch, vol. i. 1840. VOL. IV. modification therein. As the transient forms of the human foetus are for the most part comparable to the persistent forms of the lower animals, the malformations occasioned by impeded developement often acquire a brute appearance ; and thus a reason is at the same time given why they exhibit, in dif- ferent animals, the form of the lower, but not of the higher classes. A consequence of this mode of origin is, that they never deviate so much from the normal form as would exclude them from the rank of organized beings; and that the devia- tions from the natural form are confined within definite limits, so that they always re- remind us more or less of the regular form. Fixed laws of organization prevail in them, by which they exhibit a certain fitness of organization, and a tendency to render the capacity for life as great as possible, not- withstanding the malformation. Peculiar vi- tal relations are hereby produced adapting them for uterine lite, and many are brought forth well nourished and at full time. Most, however, are unfit for life after birth, though for very different reasons. The following remarks may serve for the elucidation of these peculiar vital accommo- dations : — 1. We never see in malformed births, dis- similar parts fused or united with each other, such as the intestinal tube with the aorta, the arteries with the nerves, &c. Each part, therefore, retains, to a certain degree, its own independence, according to what Fleisch- mann denominates lex proprietatis. The gullet sometimes coalesces with the larynx, and the bladder with the rectum ; but these parts are not originally dissimilar, being developed from a common mass. 2. The malformed parts are restricted to their determinate place, according to what Fleischmann denominates lex topicorum. 3. No malformed organ loses entirely its own character, and no malformed animal loses its generic distinction. It is, therefore, justly observed by Soemmering, that nature does not deviate ad infinitum, and that even in mon- strosities a distinct gradation and natural or- der are observable. An immediate consequence of this must be, that in one arid the same sort of monstrosity, there are different degrees of malformation, varying from the greatest possible degree to the very least. We might thus consider the different monstrosities as so many genera, and their varieties as so many species, where- by, according to J. T. Meckel, a new or- ganic kingdom is constituted, differing only from the others by less constancy of form. Consequently a definite type prevails in the generation of monstrosities, and they are subjected to fixed organic laws. This order appears even—1. In the number in which they occur within a certain space of time. In 3000 births in Paris, there occurs about one monster (J. Geoffroy St. Hilaire). 2. In the sex. In impeded developement, the mal- formed children are more frequently female, 3 PTERATOLOGY. in some sorts of double monsters, male. 3. In a definite proportion between the species of the animals, and the most frequent monstrosities in them. Cyclopes, for instance, especially with a snout,occur most frequently in swine ; double monsters in man. 4. In the constant form of monsters, even amongst the most heteroge- neous animals. Cyclopia, double monsters, acrania, have in Birds precisely the same cha- racters as in the Mammalia. 5. In the greater predisposition to monstrosity among some animals. This is greater among domestic than among wild animals; greater among the more perfect, than among the less perfect; three-fourths of the monstrosities occur among Mammalia, one- fourth among Birds (J. Geoffroy St. Hi- laire). They happen seldom among Reptilia, still less frequently among Fishes, Mollusca, Articulata, and Radiata. From these premises the consequence is easily derived, that monstrosities do not take place by chance, and therefore do not by any means deserve the so very general appellation of caprices of nature (lusus nalurce). The result of this is, that they often present a quantitative antithesis, according to what Geotfroy St. Hilaire denominates loi de ba- lanconent. According to this law, the ex- cessive developement of one part of the body is often connected with checked formation of another. To anencepha/ia, cyclopia-, spina bifida, are often joined fingers and toes in ex- cessive number ; to sireno-melia superfluous vertebrae and ribs ; and frequently there occur in double monsters malformations of the head. Meckel saw, in one single instance, this an- tithesis extend itself over different children of one and the same mother. A girl had on each extremity a superfluous digit, and one hand of her sister wanted four fingers, being the number of digits which her sister had in excess, reckoning the four extremities together. I have now arrived to the classification of monstrosities ; but in order to prevent all unnecessary waste of time, I shall avoid entering into a full critical examination of the systems propounded by Licetus, Huber, Wigtel, Malacarne, Buffon.Blumenbach, Brcs- chet, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Gurlt, Otto, and Bischoff. Concerning these I refer to Bis- choft'*, from whom Rokitansky has chiefly borrowed what he gives in his manual. Ac- cording to my conviction, no suitable clas- sification of monstrosities can be given, and the efforts employed to this end may be re- garded as failures. I confine myself, therefore, to a simple grouping, taking embryogenesis as my basis, without presuming on any further classification, and I thus avoid a barbarous nomenclature, which, in my opinion, is at- tended with no advantage. My object is simply to make the doctrine of malformations useful for physiology and for medical practice, nearly in the same manner as was done, almost * Entwickelungs Geschiehte mit besondere Be- rilcksichtigung tier Missbildungen, in K. Wagner Handwiirterbueh d. Physiologie, B. i. S. 887. simultaneously with me, by the excellent F. A. von Amnion.* Malformations of the Ovum. 1. Mo/a botryoides or hydatica, — Hydromctra aquatica,—is a degeneration of the chorion into vesicles of different sizes, filled with a serous liquor, which were erroneously taken for hy- datids. They cover the surface of the en- larged ovum, and are the villi of the chorion, which, as no formation of vessels took place, retained their original vesicular form (Ruysch, Albinus, Sandifort, Cruveilhier, Velpeau). Sometimes a foetus is found in it, which, how- ever, in relation to the ovum may be said to be small. The small embryo most probably dies in the early period of pregnancy, and the degenerated ovum continues to grow till a later period, when it is evacuated. In most cases abortion is the consequence of this condition of the ovum. Sometimes, nevertheless, the pregnancy lasts till the full time (Gregorini), or sometimes longer, as happened in a case observed by Lossius, in which it lasted six years. Sometimes the foetus disappears, and then this degenerated vesicular mass is evacuated alone, with ex- cessive haemorrhage and great pain. This is the last period of what is called false preg- nancy. The vesicles are inclosed in a kind of de- cidua ; they are fixed on pedicles, from which arise other vesicles with smaller stems, so as to give to the whole the appearance of the chorion, in an earlier period of its existence, when the villi still preserve their original vesicular form. The accurate observations of Boeck show that, in most cases, these vesicles contain blood, which sometimes can be dis- placed by pressure from the one to the other vesicle, or is coagulated. The internal sur- face of the membrane which forms the vesicle is smooth, the external interwoven with fibres. A thus degenerated ovum has not the power of bringing the foetus to a state of perfect maturity. The death of the foetus anil mis- carriage are its consequences. Sometimes the Mola botryoides is accompanied by malfor- mation of the foetus ( Valisnieri). From this degeneration ought to be distin- guished : 1st. The vesicular degeneration of the placenta, when retained after a natural parturition in the womb (Gregorini) ; 2nd. The Polypi fugaces or vesiculates evacuated in the anni climacterici by elderly women (Lev- ret) ; 3rd. Those after suppressed menstrua- tion in unpregnant women (Schleierbach, Watson, Sporing, Lisfranc). As I have no ob- servations of my own of any of these cases, 1 dare not pronounce any opinion about the affinity of these vesicles to the Mola botryoides. 2. Separation of the placenta into lobes or cotyledons. — This is without doubt to be attributed to an arrest at a lower degree of developement, and it offers some resemblance * Die atigeborenen Chirurgischen Kranklieiten des Mensclieii. Berlin, 1842.947 TERATOLOGY. 3 P 2 to the placenta of the Ruminants. The smallest amount of deviation is a division into two coherent lobes, which are separated only by a small constriction (J. F. Meckel, Ebert). Such a placenta has an oblong form. Sometimes there is a single lobe adjoined to the placenta (placenta sucecnturiata) ; it is of much smaller dimensions than the placenta itself, and united to it by vessels, without a cord. The placenta may also be divided into three (Rohault, Schvvencke), four (Hoboken), five (Meckel), or seven lobes (Kerckring, Wrisberg). In the observation of Kerckring, the arrest at a lower stage of development is clearly shown by the presence of the Vena omphalo-mesenterica. 3. The vessels of the umbilical cord are sepa- rated near the placenta, and meet at a con- siderable distance from it (Sandifort, Wrisberg, Adolph). In one of the published cases, this disposition of the vessels was the cause of their rupture, which produced the child's death by haemorrhage. Sometimes they were ob- served to run separately from the placenta to Fig. 597. the abdomen of the foetus, into which they penetrated through separate openings. In most cases they meet each other just at the umbilicus (Gavel, Van Solingen). 4. The umbilical cord loo long. — The com- mon length of the cord is twenty inches (Roederer, Wrisberg), but it may be Ibrty- eight inches (Wrisberg), sometimes even five feet (Morlanne). The usual effect of such an abnormal length of the cord is a circumvolu- tion of it round the body of the foetus. An example of it is given in a very misformed foetus in fig. 597. A circumvolution of this kind may some- times become dangerous : 1. By acting as a ligature round the neck, and producing stran- gulation of the foetus (Buchanan, Hebenstreit); 2. By constricting one of the extremities, and producing the spontaneous amputation of Montgomery (Art. Fcetus,^. 157. Vol. 11.) 3. By forming single or compound knots. Although these are in general not dangerous, while the vessels are sufficiently protected against pressure by the Whartonian gelatine, they may nevertheless in some cases be drawn so tight as to obstruct the communication between mother and child (Sandifort, Irvets, D. W. H. Busch) ; and sometimes the um- bilical cord breaks off near the knot when the vessels have become obliterated by the pres- sure. Fig. 598. gives an example of this in an acephalus. Fie. 598. Malformed Fat us, showing the cord entwined around the neck and part of the boily. (After Bonn.~) 5. The umbilical cord too short. — Wrisberg gives as a minimum a measure of seven inches. It may, however, be much less. This short- ness of the cord is in general accompanied by a deformity of the foetus, usually by ectopia of the abdominal viscera, by which it indi- dicates an arrest of developement at an earlier period of embryogenesis. In this way we should interpret the accounts of absence of the umbilical cord. 6. Absence of one of the umbilical arteries, is even observed in double monsters, but occurs principally in ectopia viscerum abdomi-948 TERATOLOGY. nalium, and in defective formation of the infe- rior part of the body. Serres hence derived the conclusion, that this malformation is the con- sequence of the want of one of the umbi- lical arteries ; which is however wrong, as the evolution of the whole body may be complete, even when one of the umbilical arteries is wanting. Fig. .599. represents a specimen of this kind. Fig. 599. a, aorta; b, b, spermatic arteries; c, superior mesen- teric ; d, d, common iliacs; e, the single umbilical artery; vena cava. Mende even observed in a very well formed child absence of one of the umbilical arteries, together with an unusual course of the umbi- lical vein, which, instead of communicating with the vena portas, opened immediately into the right auricle of the heart. 7. Increased number of the vessels of ihe cord. — A double umbilical vein is constantly to be found in the Quadrumana of the New World (Rudolphi). In Man the unusual plurality of the umbilical vessels is but ap- parent, as it is produced by the persistence of the vasa omphalo-mescnterica. 8. Persistence of the umbilical vesicle, is a natural condition in the Onistiti (Rudolphi), and occurs as a deviation in Man. Sometimes it is only its duct that remains united with the small intestine, forming what we call a diverticulum. 9. Constriction of the umbilical cord occurs at the point where the cord penetrates into the abdomen. In the constricted part the vessels, although remarkably narrowed, still allow in some measure the circulation of the blood. The cord is thereby contorted into a spiral. The death of the foetus is its usual effect (Landsberger). Fig. 147. of the second volume of this Cyclopaedia gives a represent- ation of this constriction of the umbilical cord. 10. The umbilical cord too thick. — Its dia- meter varies from 1 \—2\ inches. This is, in general, the consequence of an uncommon accumulation of the Whartonian gelatine, or of an (Edematous conditon. In one of the recorded cases, the superior extremities were wanting, and the anus was closed. In other cases it is occasioned by an enormous quan- tity of the liquor amnii, which is usually accompanied with an abnormal developement or impeded growth of the foetus. Malformations of the Fcetus. It is impossible to give in a concise article, such as is suited to a cyclopaedia, a complete description of all the various malformations of the foetus. I must refer to my manual, published in Dutch, under the title De mens- chelyJce Vrucht beschouwd in hare regelmatige en onrcgelmalige ontwikkeling, Amsterdam, 1840 en 1842, and to my Tabula; ad illustran- dam Fmbryo-genesin Hominis et Mammalium, where a more full and accurate description of the various kinds of malformations of the foetus is to be found. I can give here only a short description of the principal groups, as an introduction to the doctrine of the malfor- mations of the foetus. A. Monstrosities produced by an Arrest of Developement. I. Non-closure of the anterior Part of the Body. Embryogenesis teaches us, that the tho- racic and abdominal cavities are originally open, and close themselves by degrees at a later period of uterine life. The late ossifica- tion of the sternum and of the pubic bones is the result of this original disposition. The points of ossification are not formed in the broad cartilaginous basis of the sternum be- fore the fourth or fifth month of pregnancy ; they are in the beginning widely separated from each other by broad intervals in the middle, and approach later to fuse into one central osseous piece. This mode of formation explains some of the original malformations of the sternum; namely,its abnormal breadth, the openings which are found in it, and its separation into two parts. These two last conditions denote, that the sternum is the compound of two lateral halves fused together (Rathke). The separation of the sternum into two parts usually accompanies ectopia of the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Sometimes, although the thoracic viscera are enclosed in their cavity, the original divi- sion of the sternum remains, and is covered up by the skin ( Picker, Serres, Winslow). In some rare cases, the whole or the largest part of the sternum is absent in individuals with no other deformity (Von Amnion). In most of these cases the manubrium alone is present (Wiedemann). In some, but very rare, cases the anterior wall of the thoracic and abdomi- nal cavity is only closed by the skin, and its osseous and fleshy parts are completely defi- cient (R. G. Mayne). The linea alba is, as well as the sternum, the cicatrix of a cleft existing at an earlier period. This explains its abnormal breadth, obvious in those cases in which the wall of the abdomen has been919 TERATOLOGY. 3 p 3 closed at a later period than usual. An ex- ample of it is given in my Tabula XXIV. Jig. 4. Sometimes the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall are wanting, in which case the convolutions of the intestines may be .seen and felt through the skin (Von Amnion). The thoracic and abdominal cavities being open in the first periods of embryogenesis, if this condition persists abnormally, it produces ectopia of the thoracic and abdominal viscera. The aperture through which the ectopia takes place has a constant tendency to close; it shrinks therefore sometimes to a very small opening (Hammer). Sometimes it is closed in the middle, by a band which separates the uncovered viscera into two portions (Hiihner, Wolff). Its principal forms arc : — 1. Fissure of the whole anterior Wall of the Body. a. Complete ectopia of the thoracic and abdo- minal viscera, which lie bare upon the anterior surface of the body, to which is generally added a cloaca. {Fig. COO.) Fig. GOO. Child with ectopia viscerum. a, liver; b, heart; c, c, lung ; d, stomach ; e, spleen ; f,f, intestinal canal; g, kidney ; h, chorion; i, am- nion ; k, umbilical cord; in, placenta. The skeleton is very imperfect, in this com- plete ectopia ; the thorax open, and the ver- tebral column misformed by scoliosis.— This may produce, as often met with in calves, a complete inversion of the body, so that through distortion of the spine, the head is placed between the hind feet. This is what (iurlt calls sehistozomus rcjiexus, and what I represent in Jig. 601. Fig. GO). Sehistozomus rcjiexus (Gurlt). 2. Fissure of the Thorax. Ectopia of the heart. — In the regular evo- lution of the foetus, the opening on the anterior wall of the body closes itself, first at its superior part, so as to cover the thoracic viscera, while a part of the abdominal intes- tines still remain out of their cavity and in the sheath of the umbilical cord. Thus the thoracic cavity is in general already closed, whilst the abdominal is yet open. Neverthe- less, it sometimes happens that the abdominal cavity is completed, and that its viscera are perfectly enclosed, whilst the thorax remains open, and the heart is placed on its anterior surface. In this malformation, called ectopia coi-dis, the heart has no pericardium, and is situated on the median line of the anterior wall of the thorax ; it is more or less rounded, ami in general well formed, as may be seen in Jig. 595. The sternum is wanting (Tournelle, Norand, Sandifort) ; divided into two parts (Buttner, Martinez) ; or formed only by the manubrium (Manchardt). It is rarely com- plete ; but this is often the case when the heart protrudes at the neck (Muse, Bubon- nais, Breschet), or in the epigastric region (Wilson). During foetal life, the ectopia of the heart is immaterial, but soon after birth it causes the death of the child. Cruveilhier published some interesting observations on the move- ments of the heart in a case in which life was protracted for a longer time than usual.* * British and Foreign Review, No. XXVI. October. 1841, p. 533.950 TERATOLOGY. 3. Fissure of the anterior abdominal Wall. a. Complete ectopia of the abdominal viscera. —The abdominal cavity is in general the last closed. When it alone remains open, the abdominal viscera only lie out of the body. The fissure is mostly extended from the ensi- form process of the sternum to the pubic bones. One of the umbilical arteries is in ge- neral wanting. Commonly this malformation is complicated with adhesion of the membranes of the ovum or of the placenta to the divided integuments of the abdomen, with a cloaca, with defective generative or uropoietic organs, and with an incomplete pubic articulation. b. Congenital umbilical hernia. — In a less degree of deformity, the fissure is limited to the epigastric region, above the insertion of the umbilical cord, because this part of the abdomen remains longest open. This gives origin to congenital umbilical hernia. — The umbilical cord passes under the viscera, which lie exposed, or are only covered by the peri- toneum. In the last case a sort of hernial sac is formed, which has a cylindrical or glo- bular form, and is produced by the two coats of the ovum. The external coat is that part of the amnion which is the covering of the umbilical cord; the internal, the peritoneum, which is con- sidered by Meckel as a continuation of the chorion from the umbilical cord. All these facts prove that congenital umbilical hernia is caused by an arrest of developement at that stage, in which a part of the abdominal viscera are contained in the sheath of theumbilical cord. The size of the tumor is variously modified by the number and by the volume of the viscera contained in it. When it contains the liver, it is of a bluish colour. The viscera lying in it, are always in an imperfect con- dition. Only four cases are known, in which the life of the malformed child lasted for any time after birth (Meckel, Cruveilhier, Ribke, Van der Voort) ; in the case of Van der Voort for eight, in that of Ribke for twelve months. In all these cases the external coat of the hernial sac has mortified, and the tu- mor has become gradually covered by the skin. An accurate diagnosis of this malformation is of great value. In two cases, in which it was rot accurately recognised, a ligature was put round the tumor, and it was cut off. One of these cases was the subject of an interesting law proceeding. c. Congenital ventral hernia. — The abdo- minal cavity may also remain open, below the umbilical cord (Fried, Hasenest, Bouchard). This produces congenital ventral hernia. The viscera lie exposed, or are covered by the peritoneum. d. Acquired umbilical hernia. — Hernia in the umbilical cicatrix ought to be distinguished from all these forms of ectopia. It is not a congenital deformity, but is produced after birth by an expansion of the umbilical cicatrix to a globular, a cylindrical, or a conical tumor. It is often observed in adults. If we adopt f or these the name of acquired, and for those of new-born children that of congenital hernia, it would be better to give to the true con- genital umbilical hernia the name of hernia funiculi umbilicalis (Seiler). 4. Fissure of the pubic and ht/pogastric Regions. It sometimes happens that the pubic region alone remains open. For a correct idea of the malformations produced by it, it should be borne in mind that in the Mammalia, and, as re- cent observations teach, also in Man (BischofF, Wagner, A. Thompson, Coste, Sevres, Ar- nold), the urinary bladder is formed by the allantois. This is originally in communication with the inferior part of the intestinal canal, so as to form for both a common outlet, called a cloaca, from which are evolved at a later period the peripheral openings of the in- testinal tube, and of the uropoietic and ge- nerative organs. The pubic bones are formed later than the iliac (Meckel) and the pre- viously existing ischiatic bones. Their forma- tion proceeds from the outside to the inside ; therefore they are at first separated from each other by a large interval, and subsequently ap- proach each other, in a gradual manner, for the formation of an amphiarthrosis. The foetus may be arrested at this period of incomplete pubic articulation. In an observation of Walter, there was a fissure in the pubic region, though the genital and uropoietic organs were not malformed. This is the normal condition of some mammalia, and of the majority of birds. An arrest of developement may also take place at the period when there exists a fusion between the rectum and the allantois. Of this various forms occur. a. Formation of a cloaca.— A cloaca is said to exist, when the generative and urinary organs and the rectum have a common outlet. This is often complicated with ectopia of the tho- racic and abdominal viscera. The cloaca may also exist alone. In its highest degree, the ureters, the imperfect organs of generation, and the opening of the rectum, are situated close to each other in a circular depression (Petit). In other cases, which approach more to the natural condition, there is a primordial urinary bladder, formed of two se- parate parts (Mery), or merely constituted by its bare posterior wall. Fig. G02. shows how the fissured urinary bladder may be complicated with the formation of a cloaca. In most of the cases which I have pub- lished, the opening through which the faeces are evacuated, is formed by the ileum, and the rectum is closed or wanting. This con- firms the original formation of the intestinal tube by a mouth- and anus-gut. In a case men- tioned by Jung these two portions are quite separate, and have each its separate open- ing on the prolapsed posterior wall of the urinary bladder. When these two openings are fused, the cloaca persists, but approaches more to the natural condition. This may take place in different ways:— 1. The orifices of the ureters only may be found on the posterior wall of the bladder, or in the so-called in- verted bladder, while the rectum still coheresTERATOLOGY. 9M 3 P 4 with the genital organs, just as in the cases of imperforate anus just mentioned (Meckel, Burns), or with an open anus, as in the cases of Zhryham, Oliver, and Bonnet; this condi- tion approaches the nearest to the natural state, Fig. 602.

The rectum may be separate, while the uri- nary bladder remains fissured and fused with the genital organs (Meckel, Gross); 3. The fissured urinary bladder may be separated from the anus, without taking up the ureters, which then open themselves into the rectum (Meckel, OberteufFer). In some cases the outlets of these three apparatus are found not on a flat surface, but in a cavity. The cloaca, existing previously on the surface of the body, is then removed from it and folded in, so as to form a cavity. In another degree of malformation the cavity is formed, and the uropoietic and generative organs are completely separated from each other; but the rectum, being a distinct organ, is nevertheless in connection with one of the said parts, by means of a sort of canal. In the female sex this communication is found between the rectum anil vagina (fistula ani vaginalis congenita); in the male sex between the rectum and urinary bladder (fistula ani vesicalis congenita). The transition towards the natural state is nearest when the rectum opens into the urethra ; to this condition, when it is complicated with an imperforate anus, Papendorp has given the name of atresia ani urethralis. h. Congenitalfissure of the urinary bladder.— Without a cloaca, and with a perforate anus, the interior surface of the posterior part of the bladder may lie exposed on the hypogas- tric region (■prolapsus, invcrsio, fissio vesica1). It then forms a red, spongy tumor, situated somewhat above the separated pubic bones, and involving the umbilicus, so as to give the appearance of a deficiency of the um- bilical cicatrix. In male children the ori- fices of the vasa deferentia are to be found on the inferior part of the tumor. The ure- thral orifices are papillary eminences on the naked internal surface of the bladder. The urine drops continually out of them, but may sometimes be seen to issue in a small stream. The pubic bones are widely apart, sometimes with an interspace of four inches. They have no intermediate cartilage, but are merely united together by a ligament, without form- ing a synchondrosis. The consequence of this is a very peculiar reeling in the walk of the malformed subject, and a great disposition to inguinal hernia, due to the absence of suf- ficient support at the interior surface of the body. The penis is fissured on its superior surface (epispadias). The testes are, even in adults, very small, and often retained in the abdomen or in the inguinal canals. The seminal vesicles, the prostate and the vasa deferentia, offer various deviations. In the female sex the labia majora and minora are separated and without a commissure at their upper part. The vagina is often closed or very narrow. The anus is more protruded than in the natural condition. Sometimes the penis is epispadiac, with a well-formed urinary bladder. In such a case, Bonn found, nevertheless, the pubic bones apart, but united by a ligamentous texture. Although the continual dropping of the urine is a very annoying disturbance, which I contrived to remove by the means illustrated in Jigs. 603 and 004 , and although the generative organs are very incomplete, this malformation is not dangerous to life, which in several cases has been remarkabiy protracted.

Ectopia vesica; urinaria?. — The smallest degree of deformity is when the urinary blad- der remains intact, but lies in an opening in the wall of the hypogastric region. It is ecto- pia vesica; urinaria?, of which a representation is given in Jig. 605.; and for more details I refer to my " Tabulae ad illustrandum embryo- genesin,'' etc., Tab. xxx. Fig. 605.

(/. Invcrsio vesica: urinaria?. Pro/apsus ve- sica; urinaria? inverse.— If the urachus re- mains open after birth, the urinary bladder may be expelled, and thereby inverted through it. R. Fronep(C/iirnrg. Kupfertafeln, Heft 67. Taf. cccxl.) has given an example of this malformation. It ought to be distinguished from the inversion of the bladder through the urethra, which is possible even in adult women (Voigtel). If. we take a general survey of all these cases of non-closure of the hypogastric region, it is evident that they are intimately connected with one another. The cloacal disposition is the highest, the ectopia of the urinary bladder the lowest, de- gree of malformation, and therefore the latter is a distinct transition towards the natural con- dition. The inversion of the urinary bladder observed by Froriep has, as to its origin, no direct relation to the other forms. It is but an accidental effect of the remaining open of the urachus, through which the bladder chanced to become inverted, and the urine flowed away through the urethra if the child was held up- right. From the gradual transition of one form into the other, I conclude that the origin of this malformation cannot well be attributed to a mechanical cause, as Duncan and Bonn have asserted nearly at the same time. They both consider it the effect of a preternatural accumulation of urine, causing a violent dis- tension, and later a rupture of the bladder, of the urethra, of the hypogastric region, and of the pubic articulation. This theory had already, in the year 1816, a very strong oppo- nent in my father (Verh. d. le kl. van het Koninkl. Nederl. Instit. I). II. B. 88). His chief arguments against it, to which I add my own, are: I. That, if the urinary bladder bursts,as may happen in adults, the urine will be evacuated into the abdominal cavity, without Assuring the anterior wall. 2. That it is improbable that in some cases such an accumulation should fissure the whole apparatus, and in others re- strict its effect to the corpora cavernosa, penis, and the urethra, as may be seen in simple epispadias (W. Vrolik, Bosson, Sals- mann, Morgagni, and Oberteuffer). 3. That by an observation of Baillie is proved, that in fissure of the urinary bladder the posterior part of the urethra may remain intact and closed, while the corpora cavernosa are fissured at the anterior part of the penis. 4. That I have often found in the fcetus atresia urethra; com- plicated with an unusual expansion of the urinary bladder and of the ureters, but with- out the least sign of bursting or of producing the malformation in question. 5. That ectopia of the urinary bladder demonstrates that the anterior wall of the abdomen may be open, the urinary bladder remaining intact; or the sup- posed effect may exist, when the cause is absent. From all these and other remarks and observations I conclude that the origin of this malformation is not to be found in a mechanical cause, neither internal nor external (Roose). I am much more inclined to ascribe all its different forms to arrest of develope- ment. My chief grounds for this opinion are the frequent coexistence of: — 1. The want of arteries Iii/pogaHrica? (G. Vrolik) ; 2. Ab- normal condition of the kidneys and the ure- ters (Pinel, Cooper, Isenflamm); 3. Fis- sured dorsal vertebra? (Littre, Revolat, Delfin, G. Vrolik); and many other malformations, as labium leporinum (Dupuytren, Meckel), con- fluent toes (Saxtorph). The only question which remains is, what is the cause of this imperfect developement ? As to the cloacal953 TERATOLOGY. formation, it is certain that it may be said to be an arrest at an earlier period of evolu- tion ; but this is not certain with regard to the vesica fissa. The origin of this can only be explained by an imperfect developemeut of the urinary bladder from the allantois. It is not improbable, as my drawing of the cloacal formation shows also, that the urinary bladder is formed by two half-parts, which approach each other anteriorly and posteriorly on the mesial line. If this junction does not occur, the different forms of vesica inversa will be formed. Atresia ani is, in the cloacal dis- position, without doubt, an arrest of deve- lopement at an early period of embryoge- nesis; for previously the anus is closed. And epispadias shows that the penis is formed by two parts, which may remain separated from each other on the superior surface. Con- sequently it appears, that the name of vesica inversa is as improper as that of vesica fissa. But I shall propose no other name, because we know sufficiently the meaning of it. 5. Cervical Fissure (Fistula colli congenita). Recent observations teach us that the ori- ginal branchial fissures may persist in the neck even in adults. Hyrtl mentioned this malformation in a man of twenty, in whom the external cervical opening was small and com- municated with the pharynx close to the epi- glottis. Among 34,000 young men, Riecke found a fistula colli congenita twice. G. Fissure of the Face. In order to obtain a correct notion of the different forms under which fissure of the face may occur, it will be necessary to know the gradual metamorphoses of the face during its developement. Originally there is a common oral and nasal cavity. The place of the nose is occupied by two fissures, which extend from the internal angles of the eyes to the superior margin of the oral cavity. There is at this period not the least indication of a palate, so that the mouth and the nose form one common cavity. In a human foetus of less than an inch in length, Meckel found the first rudiment of a palate, in the form of an arc or a horse-shoe shape. On each side this arc is gradually completed, so as to be at first open at its posterior part, but closed afterwards, and forming a complete trans- verse plate, se[wating the nasal from the oral cavity. Rathke examined this more in de- tail, in foetuses of the sheep : — 1. He learned that the supermaxillary ca- vity is formed on each side from the lateral walls of the cranium. 2. That between those two parts grows out of the frontal wall of the skull a third eminence, which forms the basis for the sep- tum of the nose, that is, for the formation of the vomer, of the septum of the ethmoid bone, ami of the intermaxillary bones. 3. That the two psrts, quoted under No. 1., are bent inwards, and coalesce with the mesial part. 4. That the nasal cavity is at first a groove, and has originally a form which persists through their whole life in fishes. 5. That the oral and the nasal cavity form originally a common cavity. 6. That the palate is originally a fissure. By arrest of developement in these different stages of embryogenesis, are formed the dif- ferent species of facial fissure. a. Complete fissure of the face. -— The high- est degree of malformation is, when the fissure is extended from the angle of the mouth to the internal angle of the eye, the orbits, the nose, and the mouth forming but one cavity. J. S. Meckel, Van Doeveren, and myself have published examples of this malformation com- plicated with acraina. The fissure sometimes extends onl y over one lateral part of the face (Leuckart), and in the greatest transition to the natural condition it is but a shallow groove, as is represented in fig. 596. A fissure sometimes extends in a transverse direction over the head. C. Meyer observed this twice in new-born sheep. In both the palate had a double fissure, and the normal opening of the mouth reached as far as the ear, which in one of these lambs presented a trans- verse fissure. b. Double labium leporinum. — A transition to the normal condition, yet a very imper- fect one, is when the fissure is not extended over the whole surface of the face, but is re- stricted to the upper jaw. The highest de- gree of deformity is double hare-Hp with fissured palate (Labium leporinum duplex cum pa/a/o fisso). On each side of the upper lip a fis- sure extends from the angles of the mouth to the al(E nasi. Between these is a protube- rant tubercle, covered by a separate part of the upper lip, and consequently by the external skin and the gums. The tubercle is connected with the septum of the nose, generally obliquely distorted, and is filled up with the germs of the incisors. By the confusion of the oral and nasal cavities, the true nasal ori- fices are wanting, the osseous palate is defec- tive, the soft palate and the uvula are fissured, anil the vomer united anteriorly with the pro- tuberance, hangs in the midst of the fissure. In a lesser degree of malformation, the alveolar margin of the upper jaw is alone fissured, and in the least degree the palate is complete. c. Single hare-lip. — This name is adopted for the malformation when it is limited to one lateral part of the face. It may be complicated with fissured palate. The lip is then, on one side, fissured to the nostril, so as to form there an immediate communication between the oral and nasal cavity. The direction of the fissure is seldom accurately in the mesial line. If this occurs, it is the result of defective in- termaxillary bones. The palate offers either a simple or a double fissure. In a less degree of malformation only the alveolar ridge is cleft, and, in the least, the palate is complete. In such a case the fissure of the upper lip is merely a small incision. d. Fissure of the palate without a hare-lip. — The alveolar margin is in this case quite complete, but the palatine and the supermaxil-954 TERATOLOGY. lary bones are largely separated from each other posteriorly, so as to form a fissure, more or less extensive, of the bony and of the soft palate. Sometimes there is only a fissure of the uvula (Von Amnion). The nearest ap- proach to the natural state is, when the planes of the palatine bones form with each other an acute angle rising high upwards in the nasal cavity (Himly, W. Vrolik). In some cases, the palate is fissured at its anterior part, close to the foramen palatinum anticum (hiatus fora- minis palatini antici, Von Amnion). En re- sume, it appears that fissure of the palate and hare-lip are independent of each other. But it may happen that, originally, the fissure of tiie palate coexists with the hare-lip and closes itself later. The indentation which is ob- served in hare-lip without fissure of the palate, between the external incisive and the canine tooth, makes it probable that nature proceeds in this manner. It is also not improbable that hare-lip may sometimes be cured spontane- ously in the womb. The gradual transition of the various forms of this malformation into each other, shows that its cause is not external and accidental, and that it is produced, neither by blows which the child inflicts upon itself with its fists (Jourdain), nor by a mechanical im- pediment preventing the union of the palatine laminae (Pinnder). Complete fissure of the face and the palate is rather to be considered as an arrest of developement at an early period of formation. Hare-lip conforms with the foetal condition in that period of develope- ment which I have called the third. If the original intermediate protuberance does not unite itself with the lateral parts, double hare- lip is formed. The protuberance obvious in it is formed by the intermaxillary bone either in its totality, or only by a part of it. If it unites itself with only one lateral part, single hare-lip is formed. The intermaxillary bone is composed of four separate parts, of which each contains an alveolus. The result of this is, that each of these parts may be united, separately, with the supermaxillary bones ; which fact explains clearly why only three or two incisive teeth are sometimes to be found in the protuberance. The fissure of the upper lip sometimes occupies the mesial line, passing through the middle of the inter- maxillary bone. This is also the case when the intermaxillary bone is wanting. In this way, all the various forms of fis- sure of the face can be reduced to an arrest of developement, which explains in the mean- time the constant tendency of the fissure to close itself, as may be observed in children having this malformation. Fissure of the palate and lip does not endanger the life of children, and union of the separated parts in hare-lip and cleft palate can be obtained by a surgical operation. e. Fissure of the under Up. — The under lip is very seldom cleft (J. F. Meckel, Von Amnion, Nicati, Bonisson). It is equally rare for the under jaw to remain after birth separated into two parts. II. Fissure of the Skull (Acra7iia). Many forms of this monstrosity are known, to which different names have been given, as acephalia spuria, microcephalia, anencephalia, hemiccphalia. But, for its shortness and ety- mological sense, I prefer the name of acrania, which was introduced by J. F. Meckel. Un- der this name I comprehend all the different forms in which this malformation occurs, and also, with Himly, the hernia cerebri. Accord- ing to my opinion, the division into different families and genera, and the nomenclature of J. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, ought to be rejected. I, for my part, am always inclined to simplify science as much as possible, and to be succinct in its exposition; and I propose, therefore, the following types. First Type. — Want of the brain, and ex- posure of the whole basis of the skull. — The superior surface of the cranium is flat, and not formed by the bones of the skull, but only by a membrane, of which the margin is very un- equal, hard, and formed by bones. The external integuments extend over this margin, and terminate there in an unequal line, which is distinctly circumscribed by the thick hair of the head. With this cutaneous border is connected the slightly vaulted membrane, of a red, somewhat bloody colour, which imme- diately covers the periosteum that invests the more or less convex surface of the basis of the skull. The brain is wanting, but the central terminations of the cerebral nerves are in most cases present, yet sometimes these also are wanting (J. F. Meckel). The forehead is flat, and directed forwards in an oblique direction. The eyes protrude on its anterior or orbital margin, covered with swollen superior eyelids, and directed more or less upwards. The face is flat, and nearly horizontal ; the upper, and still more so the under jaw are comparatively longer than those of a well-formed subject ; the tongue is in general prominent, because the mouth cannot be shut on account of the Fig. GOG.965 TERATOLOGY. length of the under jaw. These distortions give to such monstrosities a certain brute-like aspect which induced the Germans to call them KatzerJcopfe and the French tctes de crapaud. If" the cervical part of the spinal column is in the meantime cleft, the cervix is so shortened, that the head seems to be fixed on the shoul- ders, and the chin rests on the breast, as is represented in fig. 606. The malformation of the bones of the skull and of the face is very great; but as its de- scription would take too much room here, I refer the reader to my handbook and my plates, and also to fig. 007., which will give a clear idea of it.

Second Type.— The denuded surface of the basis cranii occupied by a spongy substance, instead of brain. — In most cases vesicles, filled with a serous liquor, were observed to occur in this spongy substance, and with these occasionally also medullary corpuscles, which may be considered as rudiments of brain. There is sometimes a rudiment of the cerebellum, together with a rudiment which is continued into the spinal medulla, as though it were a medulla oblongata. The cerebral nerves are sometimes quite separated from, sometimes united with, the spongy substance. Sometimes they have the form of complete or lacerated bags, which extend along the superior surface of the skull and the posterior surface of the spinal column. The spinal co- lumn is either perfect, or partially, and some- times entirely, cleft. The last of these con- ditions is represented vnjig. 608. Fig, 608. To this form of monstrosity Geoffroy St. Hilaire gives the name of anencephalns. Spe- cimens of it were found amongst the Egyptian mummies in the sacred sepulchres of the Cy- nocephali and Ibis, which is a very interesting fact as regards monstrous births in these times. Third Type.— The surface of the basis cranii only partially denuded, — a spongy tumour occupying the place of the brain. The skull may be closed at its posterior part, and remain open at its summit. A more or less malformed cerebral substance appears on the summit of the skull, just as if it were Fig. 609. Section o f the Head of a Child with Acrania, to show the union of the malformed brain icilh the spinal cord. a, I', cellular sacs, taking the place of the brain ; c, occipital bone; d, spinal cord.956 TERATOLOGY. a hernia. The parietal hones are sometimes present, together with flat frontal bones, and a perpendicular occipital bone, so that the summit of the skull is quite closed, with the exception of a small opening. Fig. 609. shows how the malformed cerebral substance is applied to the medulla spinalis. All the cerebral nerves are present. This form of monstrosity has in general a less brute-like aspect; the trunk is more evolved, and the whole body in general very heavy. Fourth Type.—The skullflat, more evolved, but having an opening, through which the brain protrudes as a hernia.—This is what we call a cerebral hernia {hernia cerebri, encephalocele), viz. a tumour covered with the external integu- ments arising from some part of the surface of the skull, and containing a part of the brain. It has commonly the form of a bag, appended to the posterior part of the skull, and resting on the neck. The head is never turned with the face upwards ; the ears do not rest on the shoulders ; the neck is not wanting. The summit of the skull is flat and closed, and its cavity is too small to include the brain, which for this reason is placed on its outside, and backwards. The occipital bone has the form of a vertebral arc, which surrounds the brain, lying at the outside. Fig. 610. shows the external appearance of Fig. 610. this monstrosity, Jig. 611. the structure of the skull. Fig. 611. a, frontal; b, parietal; c, occipital, bones. In many of the published observations, a collection of serous fluid accompanied the hernia cerebri, by which a hydro-encephalocele was formed. The situation of the cerebral hernia is in general on the occiput, but sometimes on both sides of the root of the nose (W. Lyon, Kelch) ; above the eye (Adams); on the forehead (Beclard, Saxtorph, Niemeyen, Bredon, Guyenot) ; on the fontanella magna (Held) ; in the parietal bone (Le Dran, Stein, Tren) ; on the glabella, between the orbits (Otto). On a survey of these various types, it ap- pears that they all belong to the same class of monstrosities. The nature of the malform- ation is in all the same, namely a defective de- velopement of the skull and of the brain. This takes place in different degrees, so as to convey us gradually from the complete want of brain to those cases in which it is nearly perfect, and differing from the natural condition only in situation. The constancy of form is very interesting in this monstrosity, so that the malformed children resemble each other nearly in every museum, and the pub- lished observations are quite accordant with the cases now occasionally occurring. This proves that the origin of the malformation cannot be accidental. The want of the neck, which is the reason why the ears rest on the shoulders and the chin on the breast, and which gives to this form of monstrosity such a pecu- liar character, is often the consequence of the want of some of the cervical vertebra; (Rathke, Haller, Otto), or of their mutual coalition (Rathke, W. Vrolik), or of their shortness (Sandifort.) As a transition to the brute form, this shortness of the neck is interest- ing, reminding us of the condition of the Cetacea. The prominence of the eyes is oc- casioned by the flatness of the orbits, and by the backward direction of their superior margin. It differs from the manner in which the eyes are prominent in children with internal hydrocephalus. A rich growth of hair is common to all the forms of acrania. Is not this, and likewise the abundance of areolar tissue, to be attributed to a vicarious nutritive function ? The frequent absence of the suprarenal glands (Otto), or at least their imperfection and smallness (Morgagni, Hewson, F. Meckel, Soemmering, W. Vrolik) in all acranial foetuses is remarkable. The capacity for persistent life after birth differs according to the different forms of this monstrosity. Acrania does not seem to in- terfere with uterine life. The children who are affected with it are all well nourished, and some of them even very large, at the moment of their birth. Nevertheless, they rarely live longer than a few hours. During this short life they offer some symptoms which are attributable to the reflex action of the nervous system ; such as, for instance, mus- cular contractions when the skin is touched, rejection by the mouth of the recently ex- pressed juice of Pelargonium tomcntosum, and the attempt to suck a finger introduced intoTERATOLOGY. 957 the mouth. In cerebral hernia the chance for the prolongation of life is greater. Some cases are known in which life lasted 20, 30, and even 60 years. When complicated with hydrocephalus, puncture has sometimes been instituted, but without success (Earle). Extirpation produced, in another case, in- stantaneous death. What are the causes of acrania ? From some of its forms, it is clear that there has been hydrocephalus followed by disruption (Morgagni, Penada, Sandifort, Klein, Otto). In an embryo figured by M. Schroeder Van der Kolk, the summit of the head is extended by hydrocephalus, and has on its superior surface a black gangrenous spot which seems to prognosticate a rupture. In another fcetus I observed a fissure in the midst of an analogous spot. According to my opinion, the lacerated bags, which are sometimes found on or in the summit of the naked internal surface of the basis cranii, or at the back part of the more developed skull, are caused by such ruptures. Tiedemann gives a description of such a bag, filled with serous fluid, but not yet burst, and situated upon the head of a foetus, which has the ex- ternal appearance of acrania. {Fig. 012.) Fig. 012. But in those cases in which the flat basis of the skull is only covered with a membrane and with cerebral nerves, in those in which there is a spongy substance upon it, and in those in which the skull, although flat, is otherwise complete, not the least probability exists of the rupture of a cerebral vesicle at an early period of formation. I am able to prove this, I think, by a small fcetus of two months, in which the superior part of the skull is wanting, and in which a spongy mass occupies the place of the brain. It shows that acrania may also be a pri- mitive malformation, occasioned by the simul- taneous malformation of the brain and of the skull. Why I do not impute these malforma- tions to external injury, such as the leaping of a monkey on the belly of a pregnant woman (Sandifort), to a fall down stairs (Pauli), or to the influence of imagination, needs not be demonstrated. III. Fissure of the Bach Part of the Body. Hydrorachis and Spina bifida. —■ Fissure of the spinal column (.spina bifida'), and dropsy of the spinal medulla, occur each separately,or connected together. In the highest degree of fissure, the vertebral bodies even are cleft (J. T. Meckel, Tnlp, Fleischmann). Fig. G13. represents such a case, after Cruveilhier. Fig. 613. In a less degree, the vertebral bodies are complete, but their arcs very defective, being completely wanting, or laterally incurved and fused together. In the lowest degree, the two halves of the vertebral arcs are completed, but not united together, so that posteriorly an open space remains between them, and a fis- sure occupies the place of the processus spinosi, which are separated into two lateral and equally incurved parts. When this form of fissure of the spinal column is not accompanied by hydrorachis, both parts of the vertebral arcs are not bent laterally, but meet each other so ex- actly, that no open space remains between them. Sometimes the fissure is extended over the whole vertebral column (spina bifida totalis), sometimes it is but partially cleft (spina bifida partialis). The partial fissure occurs more frequently in the lumbar than in the cervical region of the column. The cause of the greater frequency of the partial fissure in the lumbar region is to be im- puted to the termination of the spinal me- dulla in this region; to its expansion thereTERATOLOGY. 958 under the form of cauda equina; to the larger sheath formed there by the dura mater ; and to the very limited tendency which the osse- ous nuclei of the lumbar and sacral vertebrae show to unite themselves into an arc, which therefore remains always open at the inferior part of the sacrum. Although it occurs some- times alone, this sort of fissure is generally accompanied with dropsy of the spinal medulla (hydrorachis), that is to say, with a sac of a red- dish-violet colour, in which fluctuation is easily discerned. Its external covering is sometimes formed by the skin, and then it has the usual colour of the body ; the skin, however, does not in most cases cover the whole surface of the tumour, but ceases at its circumference, and the rest of its surface is only covered with the dura mater. When the child lives, the dura mater becomes, after some time, thicker, harder, and more solid. When the tumour is covered with the skin, the dura mater is to be found under it. These membranes become often so thick, and so intimately united to- gether, that it is nearly impossible to separate them from each other. The serum contained in the tumour is of a very variable quality, principally composed of albumen, mucus, ge- latin, and muriate of soda (Bostock). It is effused between the pia mater and the arach- noidea, or between this and the dura mater, or in the primitive canal of the spinal me- dulla. If this canal remains open, the hydro- rachis is in general accompanied with hydro- cephalus interims. Sometimes these sacs are found on more than one spot of the spinal medulla, or divided into two by a septum. The size of the sac varies, and the complication with hydrocephalus is very dangerous. If this is the case, the artificial opening of the sac has a very injurious effect. Convulsions and exu- dative inflammation are in most of the cases excited by it. In some very rare cases the operation was attended with success. Sir Astley Cooper healed hydrorachis by reiterated puncturing with a thin needle and by com- pression of the tumour. Dubourg is said to have treated it with success by means of ex- cision of the tumour and bringing together the lips of the wound with needles, in the same man- ner as in the operation for hare-lip. Beynard tied a ligature round the sac. E. de Thine- court compressed the tumour, after having opened it, with two small rods, which he connected and pulled together by means of ribbons. The noxious effects of hydrorachis after the child's birth make it necessary to try an operation. Before birth this mal- formation seems not to have the least in- fill' nee upon the health of the child : it is well nourished and duly constituted. After birth the noxious effect is modified by the different seat of the tumour. When seated in the lumbar and sacral region, it is the least dangerous. It is known that some indi- viduals have lived with it twenty-eight years. In most cases, however, paralysis of the in- ferior part of the body is its consequence. Hydrorachis in the cervical region is much more dangerous. One case of this is men- tioned in my " Tabula?," in which death sud- denly occurred on opening the tumour. Besides hydrorachis, some other malforma- tions of the spinal medulla are observed some- times to accompany fissure of the spinal column: 1. Complete want of the spinal medulla, com- monly connected with acrania ; 2. Its appear- ance under a cylindrical form, with persistants of the primitive medullary canal (Morgagni, Santorini), which is sometimes double (Gall, Von Ammon) ; 3. Fissure of the spinal me- dulla into two juxtaposed cords; so that it seems to be double, which is occasioned by an arrest of developement at that period of its evolution in which the two halves, of which it is formed, are as yet separate ; 4. The pre- sence of a simple nervous expansion instead of spinal medulla; 5. The lamellar form of the medulla ; 6. A too great length. By all this it is proved, that fissure of the spinal column may be accompanied with hydrorachis, and with an imperfect deve- lopement of the medulla. They are totally independent of each other, and each is pro- duced by its own cause. It is, however, not very improbable that a voluminous sac on the medulla may prevent the union of the points of ossification, by which the vertebral arcs are to be formed ; but we are not, I think, justified in concluding from this that hydro- rachis is the cause of the fissure of the vertebral column. For it may exist without fissure of the spinal column, if it has not acquired the form of a hag ; and the spinal column may be cleft although the spinal me- dulla is intact. This leads me to the con- clusion, that malformation of the spinal me- dulla, hydrorachis, and fissured spinal column, do not essentially go together. IV. Hydrocephalus congenitus. Congenital dropsy of the brain. —Under this name we understand such a great volume of the head in a full-grown foetus that it opposes in general a mechanical impediment to partu- rition, which can only be removed by an arti- ficial diminution of the volume of the head. Its forms are — 1. Hydrocephalus in tenuis; 2. Hydrocephalus extcrnus. 1. Hydrocephalus interims is said to exist when the abnormal serous secretion occurs in the ventricles of the brain, wherefore it has also acquired the very rational name of hydrops vcntriculorum cerebri. It may be an altogether primitive malformation, when the brain is arrested at that period of its de- velopement in which it has the form of a very thin vesicle, filled with a serous fluid. I have observed this condition principally in Cyclopes, and give an example of it in ^.6i4. _ In such case there is no indication of the hemispheres, nor of the convolutions of the brain, and, in general, no difference to be seen between the white and the grey cerebral substance. In small foetuses of two months, in which the bones of the skull could not yet be discerned, this form of hydrocephalus hasTERATOLOGY.

Vrolik, Rudolphi). See fig. 615. Fig. 615. {Alteredfrom Rudolphi by W. Vrolii.) Human Ovum, with an Embryo of two months, affected with hydrocephalus. 959 Internal hydrocephalus is, however, not always occasioned by arrest of develope- ment in an early period of formation, but may lie produced by chronic inflammation, (G. Vrolik), to which the child is, without doubt, as much subject during uterine life as after its birth. The principal causes of it seem to be external injuries suffered by the pregnant woman, and sometimes even reite- rated contact by the act of copulation, if the pelvis is large, and the womb seated very low. Pseudo-membranes are on this ac- count often found on the internal surface of tiie expanded ventricles (G. Vrolik), by which the deposition of the serous liquor may be limited to one or more of the cerebral ven- tricles, so as to produce an a-symmetrical expansion of the head ; this is, on the con- trary, symmetrical, if both the lateral with the third and fourth ventricle are equally and universally extended by the fluid. The head acquires, in such case, an enormous, but sym- metrical, volume (E. Sandifort, W. Vrolik). The slower such a secretion of fluid takes place, the slower the head increases in volume and the less it endangers life, and the less' the free evolution of the mental faculties is interfered with. Some cases are men- tioned, in which life lasted sixty years (G. Vrolik), thirty years (Michaelis), and fifty- four years (Gall). It is remarkable that in many of these cases, neither the senses nor the intellectual faculties were in the least im- paired. This proves that the substance of the brain is not altered by it, and that the form only of the brain is changed by the unfolding of its convolutions. This unfolding is the consequence of the pressure which the fluid exercises from the inside towards the outside, and of the thereby augmented volume of the ventricles (Hunauld, Gall). Those who presume that through the influ- ence of the serum exudated in the ven- tricles the dissolution and even the total de- struction of the cerebral substance may be effected, go evidently too far (Cruveilhier). However large may be the surface into which the hemispheres of the brain have been un- folded, the white medullary substance can always be distinguished from the grey (G. \rohk). The parts contained in^the ventricles are sometimes intact (G. Vrolik) but sometimes incompletely developed, and what we should call depressed (Aurivillius Buttner, Malacarne, Klein). The corpus callosum assumes a thin lamellar form- the septum pelhicidum and the fornix become thinner; the glandula pituitaria and pinealis deviate in general from their natural condition (Friend, Malacarne, Wrisberg). The cerebral nerves are in general not changed, and the cerebellum is in most cases natural. The lumen of the cerebral arteries is commonly very large (Buttner), and Friend saw two in- ternal carotids passing through the carotid canal of the right side. In a few cases there was observed a degeneration of the cerebral substance, which resulted in a deranged and feeble state of the mental faculties (filittner)960 TERATOLOGY. Internal hydrocephalus has always a pre- judicial influence upon the condition of the rest of the body, principally upon its nutrition and upon the osseous system, which it pre- disposes to emollition. It has a very great influence on the bones of the skull. Its effects are : — a. A large expansion of the skull, whilst the face preserves its common shape, and is in great disproportion to the enormous cir- cumference of the skull. This disproportion is the most significant symptom of hydroce- phalus, and distinguishes it from simple am- plification of the head. b. A protuberance of the frontal tubero- sities, which is to be considered as an arrest at an early period of developement, occasion- ing an enormous augmentation of the facial angle, which greatly exceeds a right angle. c. A pushing downwards of the orbital parts of the frontal bone, which makes the superior orbital margins to disappear totally, and to form a protuberance with the frontal part of the frontal bone. The eyes thence acquire a strange direction, their axes being turned upwards. d. A-symmetry of the hydrocephalus head, which is always more or less oblique. This is the effect of the unequal expansion of the brain. To this may also be ascribed the strange form which the skull acquires when it is regularly extended and developed on its fore and lateral parts, whilst the occiput has a very singular prominence. Such a form is, without doubt, occasioned by a regular expansion of both the hemispheres of the brain up- and sidewards, whilst their posterior lobes and the cerebellum have preserved their regular form. The parietal bones are thereby expanded and augmented in circumference, whilst the occipital bone, not participating in the expansion, is disproportioned to the rest of the skull. The parietal bones are removed from it, so that, during the primitive ossifica- tion, an interval is formed, which is after- wards filled up with Wormian ossicles. .Not less singular is the form of the head and skull, when, probably on account of the position of the head in the womb (as is the case in a partus pedibus presviis)', the pressure of the fluid has been exerci>.ed principally downwards, so as to extend chiefly the lateral parts of the head. e. An abnormal disposition of the cranial bones. The fontanella? acquire, in the first instance, a very large dimension, and some parts of the cranial bones remain cartila- ginous, which parts are, in a more advanced period, filled up with Wormian ossicles. Baillie asserts, that sometimes the already formed sutures are opened by the serum exuded in hydrocephalus internus. In other cases, the want of closure of the sutures is to be imputed to a too great thinness of the bones. 2. Hydrocephalus externus is by some ( Mon ro, Wrisberg, Hartell) erroneously considered as the result of hydrocephalus internus, followed by laceration of the cerebral hemispheres. It is proved, by a great many observations, that such a laceration occurs very seldom. The fluid is, in most cases of hydrocephalus externus, exuded on the surface of the brain. This may be the consequence of an arrest of developement,-as I observed in a cyclopic lamb, but it may also be produced by inflamma- tion. The serum is accumulated between the dura mater and the skull, or between the two layers of the arachnoid membrane, but in most cases its situation is between the dura mater and the arachnoid membrane. In all these cases the brain is strongly compressed, shrunken, and hard (Kaltschmidt). Dullness and somnolence are, according to Frank, the consequences of hydrocephalus externus, and convulsive affections those of hydrocephalus internus. V. Accphali, or Fcetus ivitliout a Head. When we observe the fcetus in its first periods of developement, the head is not yet clearly distinct from the trunk. From the third ;o the fifth week of gestation, the head, not previously discernible, grows so rapidly, that it has in the fourth week acquired the same volume as the trunk. Now the de- velopement of the fcetus is sometimes arrested at that early stage when the head is not yet distinguishable ; the result of such an arrest must manifestly be an acephalus. This de- nomination is, again, as erroneous as many others ; for not only the head, but many other parts, are wanting. The question re- mains whether a more appropriate name could be given. Gurlt tried to do so, but, I fear, not with good success. He calls the lowest form of acephali amorphics globosus, which is a true contradictio in adjeclo, I think it there- fore proper to preserve the old name of accphali, to which I refer, as has been done by Tiedemann and G. Vrolik, nine types, for which I think it not necessary to give special names. First Type. — Acephali in the form of a rounded mass, without any indication of extre- mities,— Examples have been given by G. Vrolik, Bland, and W. Vrolik, all of twins. The rounded mass is covered with the skin ; it contains an intestinal fold, and receives the insertion of the umbilical cord. In general there is found in it the rudimental indication of vertebra? and of spinal medulla. Second Type. — Acephali in the form of a rounded mass, with indication of feet. — The chief observations of this form have been given by G. Vrolik and Clarke, in cases of twins. They have an umbilical cord, rudi- mental external genital parts, and an anal orifice, with an imperfect abdominal cavity, in which are contained an intestinal loop formed by a colon and caecum, and kidneys. Conse- quently all the thoracic viscera, the liver, the spleen, pancreas, stomach, and the small in- testines, are wanting; but there is a rudiment of a nervous system, a tolerably complete right inferior extremity, a pelvis, and a left separate foot, without femur and crus. {Figs. 616, 617.)TERATOLOGY. 9G1 Fig. 616.

Third Type.—Accphali in which the trunk is more developed, without a head and thoracic or superior extremities, but composed of an in- complete trunk, with an imperfect inferior extre- mity.— In the lowest grade of this monstrosity may be ranked an acephalus observed by Ruysch, consisting only of a leg. Somewhat more perfect is the acephalous inferior ex- tremity of a goat, mentioned by Hayn. It consisted of a pelvic bone, with the other bones of the inferior extremity, some muscles, the vessels and nerves of the femur, which were probably connected with the umbilical cord of the perfect goat born at the same time as the acephalus. Fourth Type. — AccphaJi in which the trunk is more developed, without a thorax and 'without superior limbs, and composed of an ab- domen, genital organs, and two inferior limbs. — The hypogastrium and the two inferior limbs are, then, more or less completely formed parts. With exception of one, all VOL. IV. the observations which we know of it are ot twins, and in one case of three children born at one birth. In many it is proved that the mother of the acephalus has been often fecun- dated. They are rarely full-grown at birth, and they have in most instances a placenta common to them and the well-formed child, but with a separate cord ; the foetal membranes also appear to be common to both. The cord of the acephalus contains sometimes two, sometimes three or four vessels (T. H. Kalck). The integuments of the monster, truncated at its upper part, are irregularly tumified, by a large quantity of thick, pale, or yellowish subcutaneous cellular tissue. Interiorly there are lumbar vertebrae, with a pelvis, and the bones and muscles of inferior limbs, besides the spinal marrow and its nerves; the lumbar and sacral parts of the sympathetic nerve ; blood-vessels without a heart, of which the arteries are connected with the umbilical ar- teries, and the veins with the umbilical vein ; a loop of intestines ; uropoietic, and genital parts. All the other parts are wanting. Fifth Type. —Acephali in which the trunk is much more developed, with an impetfect tho- rax, composed of some dorsal vertebra; and ribs. 7'hc superior limbs are wanting.— The only difference between this and the preceding type is in the more complete trunk, there bL-ing a thorax superadded to the abdomen. In all the other points the structure re- sembles that of the fourth type; they are Fig. G18.

Fig. 619. The skeleton of the foregoing Acephalus. a, mobile bone connected with the single cervical vertebra. always twins, and not full grown. As far as it has been mentioned by different obser- vers, there is either a common placenta, with two cords (Ponjol), or with one cord split into two (Mery) ; or there are two placentae connected together (Herholdt); or there are two totally separate ova, with a double placenta (Monro). The external appear- ance differs from that of the fourth type, by greater length, and less truncated upper part of the body, in which a feeble indication of head may sometimes be visible (Ponjol, I'rocliaska). The integuments are as in the fourth type ; the toes are generally mal- formed ; the arms and the external genital organs are often abnormal. To the lumbar part of the spinal column is joined an imper- fect osseous thorax, sometimes with cervical vertebrae (Hevermann), but without thoracic viscera. The diaphragm exists in most cases. There are vessels without a heart, which cohere with the umbilical vessels. The viscera of the epigastric region are commonly want- ing ; Atkinson mentions only a liver. In some intestines can be recognised either as inteslina tenuia or crassa. The uropoietic organs, and the internal parts of generation are commonly present. There is in all a spinal marrow. The observations as to the nervous system are verv incomplete. (SeeJigs. 618, 619.) Sixth Type. — Acephali ivith a Irunlc com- posed of a thorax and an abdomen, and ivith two superior and two inferior limbs. — When the trunk is more developed, the thorax becomes more convex, is more distinct from the abdo- men, and supports two superior limbs. These acephali, too, are twins, at least in the greater number of the cases. They are often not full-grown, and borne by women who have frequently been pregnant. The placenta is in general common to the two foetuses, but with two cords. The thorax is more perfect than in the fifth type; the upper part of the bodv terminates not in an obtuse end, but in a broad and flat surface, havir g a fissure in the midst, with an indication of a head. The sternum is often rudimentary, and the osseous frame of the superior limbs is very incom- plete. To the spinal column are added cervical vertebrae, and sometimes a confused indication of cranial bones. There is usually a dia- phragm, but neither heart nor lungs. There are commonly two vascular trunks, an arte- rial and a venous. With the venous is con- nected the umbilical vein ; and from the in- ternal iliac arteries arise the umbilical arteries. There are uropoietic organs, and an intestinal canal, with a caecal termination ; and some- times a liver. This latter is, however, some- times wanting, together with the spleen and the par creas. In the intestinal tube there is no meconium, but only a mucous substance. The nervous system is very incomplete; but there is constantly a spinal marrow with the abdominal part of the sympathetic. I have observed distinct muscles, of which the pre- sence has been denied by others. Seventh Type.—Acephali in which some cranial bones are found. — This has been observed by Herholdt, in a monster, born twin with a well-formed child, of a mo- ther who had five other children. There was an amorphous head, with an indication of eyes and nose, but without ears and mouth : the rest of the body was much de- formed. Of the cranial bones, the condyloid and vertical portions of the occipital only could be distinguished. There was no trace of facial bones. Analogous observations have been made by Curtius and Otto. Eighth Type. — Body and extremities per- fectly well developed, and having a neck, which is wanting in the other types. The neck is sur- mounted and terminated by the ears. — This is the form to which Gurlt gives the name of perocephalus aprosopus. I have met with it in the lower animals only. The body and the limbs are perfectly well developed ; on the perfect neck are placed two coalesced ears, behind which there is an imperfect cranium, composed principally of the cranial, minus the facial, bones. In all this the deformity makes a transition towards an imperfect formation of the face. (Figs. 620, 621.) Ninth Type. — Acephali which are composed of the trunk only, without the least indication of superior or inferior limbs. — Only one case of this monstrosity is known, observed by Vallis- neri. In a foetus of a very mature period of963 TERATOLOGY. Fie. 620. The superior cervical part of a peroeephalous lamb, terminated by the cars which are coalesced with each other.

There existed only a trunk, which contained a tolerably large heart, imperfect lungs, a malformed liver, a stomach, and an intestinal canal. From this survey of the characteristics which distinguish the acephali, we learn that they are born with two, three, or four other foe- tuses at one birth. Can this quantitative multiplication of the children be the cause of the qualitative malformation of one of them ? This is probable by the great fertility of the mothers of acephali, which also indicates that these monsters are produced by an arrest of developement. It is very easy to reduce their external appearance to the early periods of developement, in which the head is not yet distinct from the trunk, and in which the limbs are not yet protruded. It is worth mentioning that the abdominal cavity, with the kidneys and a part of the intestinal canal, are the most constant organs, which is very interesting with reference to the genesis of the intestinal tract. In the monstrous births of the second, third, and fourth type, there is only a colon, while in those in which a tho- rax is superadded (as in the fifth and sixth types), there is also an intestinum tenue with the csccum. I regard this as a confirmation of the statement, that the formation of the intestinal canal commences at the two ex- tremes, and proceeds from these to the mid- dle part. In the same manner the uniformity of cir- cumference of the whole intestinal tube is an arrest of developement at an early period of embryogenesis, to which may also be referred the cajcal beginning, and in many cases even thecaeeal termination of the intestine. Thefre- quent deficiency of the liver is the consequence of the absence of the stomach and duode- num, and therefore a sign that the liver is a protrusion of the mucous membrane of the in- testinal tube. The connexion between the con- taining and the contained parts is also very dis- tinctly proved by the acephali. The very gene- ral presence of the lumbar part of the spine determines the existence of kidneys ; that of the pelvis, the existence of the urinary-bladder and of the genital organs. The very imper- fect condition of the thorax is in relation with the absence of the heart. The pre- sence of vessels without a heart demonstrates that the circulation of the blood can be car- ried on by these alone, and that the forma- tion of vessels is quite independent of that of the heart. The profusion of cellular tissue, by which the swollen appearance of the acephali is produced, may be formative sub- stance, which has not been employed in the production of the other parts of the body, and which has therefore grown rather abundant. In this manner many of the peculiarities of the acephali can be reduced to fixed principles. VI. Want and defective Formation of tltc Trunk* (Aconnia'f). The highest degree of this kind of mon- strosity is where neither trunk nor limbs are formed. Lycosthenes, Rudolphi, and Nichol- son describe monstrous births, in which the head is the only part formed. nr. Sometimes only a part of the head is ormed, of which I saw an example in a mon- strous foetus born with a well-formed calf. The tongue was the only well-developed part in it. This shows that in the absence of all the central organs, heart, lungs, skeleton, and brain, there may be a well-constituted skin * The word trunk is here used to include the ex- tremities. f From a, privativum, and icoofxbs truneus. 3 o. 2964 TERATOLOGY. surrounding an amorphous mass of cellular tissue, and only a single well-formed organ. I have given a fuller account of this case in my Tab. Ixii. Jigs. 4, 5, 6. Therefore we may conclude that each part is formed sponte sua, and that it is in its evolution quite indepen- dent of the rest of the body. b. A Jess degree of malformation is when the superior part of the body is formed without the inferior limbs. Fig. 597. gives a represen- tation of this monstrosity, of which a succinct account is to be found in my Handbook, D. ii. Bl. 100, and Tab. Ixiii. c. In a more perfect developement of the trunk one of the extremities may be wanting. We call this malformation monopodia; in it one of the inferior half-parts of the body has not been formed. It makes a transition to those monsters, in which the inferior ex- tremity of the body tapers gradually into a tail-like form, which has given to them the name of monstra Sireniformia. d. Sympodia or Siren-like form is the fourth species of defective formation of the trunk. The single inferior extremity is com- Fig. 622. Fig. 623. Sympodu posed of the elements of two, and arti- culates with a pelvis, which is not formed, as in monopodia, by one bone, but by a coalescence of two. In most of them the partially double, partially single inferior ex- tremity terminates in a caudal point ; on account of which the name of Sirenes has been adopted. To this imperfection are added closed anus, defect of external genital parts, and the existence of but one artery in the umbilical cord. The malformed inferior ex- tremity has not always the same form. There- fore we admit three varieties:—1. Without a foot, Sirenomielia of J. G. St. Hilaire; 2. With a single foot, more or less complete, Uromelia of J. G. St. Hilaire; 3. With a double foot. Fig. 622. represents the second, and Jig. 623. the third variety. By this survey of the four types of de- fective formation of the trunk is proved that they form a very natural series, in which we are gradually inducted, from the total want of a trunk to monsters in which inversion of the inferior extremities is the only deviation from the natural form. The same regularity is here to be observed as in every other class of monstrosities. It is therefore impos- sible to ascribe their origin to accidental ex- ternal causes. Meckel has opposed his own9G5 TERATOLOGY. peculiar and sarcastic wit to this absurd aetiology, and gives the very ludicrous ac- count of a surgeon who supposed that the Sireniform monster had been formed during a very difficult delivery. If it is, on the contrary, an original malformation, it may be asked, what can be its remote cause ? Is it the original want of one of the umbilical ar- teries ? I should not think so ; for one of these arteries is also wanting in the variety in which all the parts of the two extremities are present, and we know that one of them may be wanting in a completely well-formed child. (See p. 948.) Another question is, whether sj/mpodia can be attributed to the coalescence of the inferior extremities (Meckel, Karam, Boerhave, and Cruveilhier). Neither am I in- clined to adopt this cause. 1. I cannot imagine a coalesence of bones so complete, that through these could be formed one single extremity. 2. It is impossible to explain by it the im- perfect condition of the leg and of the foot in the majority of cases. 3. From such a fusion or coalescence can- not be derived the imperfect state of the rectum, antl of the sexual and uropoietic or- gans. It seems to me more probable that gym- podia is due to some original malformation of the pelvis and its viscera, of which the cause remains unknown. The formation of a head solely, of an incomplete trunk without the lower limbs, or of a single inferior ex- tremity, is certainly to be attributed to nothing else but impeded developement. It shows, moreover, that the different parts of the body are quite independent of each other in their original formation. e. Original defective formation of the pelvis. In a well constituted body the pelvis may be originally malformed, as is proved by the ob~ liquely narroio pelvis of Nazele, and by the transversely narrow pelvis of Robert; of which malformation the cause is to be found in the imperfect formation of the sacrum. f. Defective developement of the spinal column. This has been principally observed in calves. It is too short, defective, more or less incurvated, and some of the vertebrae fused together. The head is situated at a short distance from the thorax ; the tail and the anus are reflected to the dorsal surface; the pelvis is too narrow, and turned upwards at its posterior part. VII. Defective Formation of the Extremities. The origin of many malformations of the limbs may be referred to the early periods of embryogenesis. But for some of them this is impossible. 1. Want of all the extremities is an arrest of developement at that period, in which the limbs are not yet formed, and in which small tubercles occupy their places. Sometimes the superior extremities only are wanting, which urges the inferior extremities to acquire a sort of dexterity by which they may in some mea- sure supply the place of the superior limbs. Of all the examples which are known of it, that of Thomas Schwcicker is the most me- morable. The inferior limbs only are rarely Fig. G24. 3ii 3TERATOLOGY. wanting, and the cases few in which there is but one superior or inferior extremity. 2. Want of the intermediate parts in the extremities, so that the hand is attached im- mediately to the shoulder, and the foot to the hip. — This may happen in one or in more extremities. Of the last, a very interesting example occurred in the person of a certain Marco Catonze, of whom I represent the ex- ternal appearance and the skeleton in Jigs. f>2-t, 625., referring for more details to my Tab. lxxvii. 3. Limbs too short.—All their parts exist in such case, but are too short, as if they were not full-grown. The malformation is however not limited to the extremities, but extends over the trunk and the head. The head has in all the known cases the aspect of hydrocephalus. The neck is short and broad, the trunk short and swollen, and the limbs short, broad, and thick. Soemmering and Otto ascribe this to congenital rachitis. But according to my opinion it ought to be attributed to defective developement, which is confirmed by the dissection, performed by (J. Mayer, of such a monstrosity. 4. Limbs which seem to be truncated.— Some- times the fore-arm and the leg terminate abruptly like stumps, and present the appear- ance of cicatrices. I saw this on the four extremities of a calf, of which i have repre- sented the external form anil the dissection in my Tabula? lxxviii. and lxxix. In many of the known cases this defective condition of the limbs seems to be the result of arrested developement. In some others, however, it is the effect of mutilation produced by the con- striction of the umbilical cord, or by pseudo- membranes. Montgomery has given many examples of it in his article FaiTUs in this Cyclopaedia. It is an interesting fact that from these stumps may grow rudiments of fingers, as Dr, Simpson showed me during the visit which I paid him at Edinburgh. 5. Diminished number of fingers and toes.— The highest degree of this malformation is the existence of but one finger or toe. Sometimes there are only the thumb and the little finger, as may be seen in a preparation in the mu- seum of Ilovius at Amsterdam. The greatest transition towards the natural condition is the presence of four fingers or four toes. 6. Coalesced fingers and toes. — In other- wise perfect limbs it is possible that hands and feet may be arrested at that inferior de- gree of developement, in which they are not yet separated into fingers and toes. The child is then born with fingers or toes, which seem to be coalesced ; but that is nothing more than a fallacious appearance. The malformation con- sists really in absence of fission. Of tins there are different degrees: a, complete absence of fingers and toes, instead of which there is a common mass ; b, connection of the fingers and toes by means of a membrane ; c, the adhesion limited to the posterior parts of the fingers and the toes, while their anterior parts are completely free. All this may be seen in figs. 620, C27, 628 Fig. 626. {After Otto.) 7. To all these malformations of the limbs ight to be added the abnormal direction of e foot; but this is fully considered in the907 TERATOLOGY. 3 Q 4 article Abnormal Conditions ov the Foot in this Cyclopaedia. VIII. Cyclopia. Upon this interesting malformation, which for many years was the object of my own inves- tigations, I should have much to say; but my friend Paget has already given a succinct survey of its different forms in his learned Article Nose, to which, therefore, I refer. I beg leave here to add to the observations which I have published in my former works upon the origin of Cyclopia, a few additional remarks on the subject. Is it an arrest of developement ? It cannot be denied that many deviations of the parts in Cyclopes may be referred to a previous natural form. For example, in one of my published cases the optic lobe and the brain formed one continu- ous part, which is certainly an early natu- ral condition. It is also certain that the disposition of the hemispheres of the brain in Cyclopes, which appear to be a single vesicle, accords with the vesicular state of the brain in the first period of its develope- ment, and that the unprotected situation of the ganglia of the brain, of the cerebellum, and of the medulla oblongata, may be con- sidered as a foetal condition. But, as to the eyes, it is not so certain that their single- ness is the result of an arrest of develope- ment. E. Huschke has, however, main- tained the opinion, that the eyes are formed by a single vesicle, which becomes sepa- rated into two ; but from the more recent and accurate investigations of Bischoff, we must conclude that the optic lobes are from the beginning separated and double, taking their origin from the anterior cerebral vesicle, and that from an abnormal condition of this last, by which the rudiments of the eyes approach each other and fuse together, may be derived the cause of Cyclopia, If this observation is true, of which it is difficult to retain the least doubt, Cyclopia really ap- pertains to the Verschmelzungs Bildungcn of Meckel in an early period of developement. Perhaps it may be compared with the meta- morphosis of the eyes in Daphnia, Cypris, Polyphemus, and Cyclops, in which there are originally two vesicular bulbs, which subse- quently coalesce into one. But however this may be, it remains certain that the malforma- tion of the cranial and facial bones in Cyclopes is the consequence of the abnormal condition of the brain and of the visual and olfactive apparatus. IX. Deficiency of ike Underjaw (JMonotia). Want of the under jaw often coexists with Cyclopia. By this complication is formed a peculiar series of monsters, which make a gradual transition to those in which, notwith- standing the presence of two eyes, the under jaw is absent. I refer to this the following species. 1. Total defect of the opening of the month,— as observed by me in a lamb, in which also the ears were removed to the basis of the head and coalesced. The under jaw was totally absent; and behind the coalescent cars there was an osseous vesicular cavity, formed by the bulbous tympanic cavities, united to- gether. 2. The opening of the mouth represented by a fissure at the inferior surfaee of the face. — The rest of the external appearance is similar to the first species. The under jaw is want- ing, but there is a rudiment of a tongue. 3. Too short an under jaw. In man and the lower animals the under jaw is sometimes incompletely developed, and more depressed posteriorly than it ought to be. This original brevity of the undcr-javv is the cause of a great many ulterior deformities. Without doubt, these three forms of mon- strosity make a continuous series. They consist, as Bischoff' says, in an imperfect developement of the first visceral arc, by which the under jaw and the bones connected there- with are either wanting or defectively formed, the result of which is, that the ears are re- moved to the basis of the head, and there become fused together. The toial defect of the opening of the mouth is the highest, the too short under jaw the least degree of mal- formation. Herewith I conclude my brief account of the monstrosities resulting from arrest of de- velopement. The description of the congenital abnormal condition of the different apparatus would oblige me to surpass the due limits of an Article for this Cyclopaedia, which already, 1 fear, may be considered rather too long ; and I think this the less necessary, because a great deal of information about them may be found in the Articles Anus, Diaphragm, Fcetcs, Hermaphroditism. I therefore pass on to a succinct description of a second group of monstrosities. B. Monstrosities produced by Excess of Developement. I. Feet us in Fee tu. The human fetus may be included in an- other fetus, or adhere to its body. This may happen in two different manners : — 1. A fetus more or less perfect contained in the cavity of the body of its twin-brother or sister. a. In the uterus. — The fetus would be pregnant in such a case at the moment of its birth. The observations given of it are, however, somewhat apocryphal. b. In the abdomen. — In a case recorded by Fattow, there are, in a fetus of seven months, two rudiments of fetuses contained in its abdomen. Such observations are also given by Reiter, Heminger, Pacini, and E. Philips. In general, the rudiments of a second fetus are very imperfect, and included in a sac. Sometimes, however, they are more Complete, which was, for example, the case in an observ- ation of Youngj of which the preparation is9G8 TERATOLOGY. preserved in the splendid Museum of the London College of Surgeons. c. In the anterior mediastinum. — As in a case recorded by Gordon, in a female of twenty- one years. d. In the scrotum and the testes. — Such cases have been noticed by Rosenberger, Ilartmann, D S.J. Wendt, Velpeau. Some- times the rudiments of a second foetus are found in the interior of the testis, sometimes at its exterior surface. e. In the stomach. f. In the intestinal canal. — Hi»hrnore has given such a case in a youth of fifteen or six- teen years, in the gut of whom an acephalus was found. g. In the orbit. — According to Barnes. h. /// the tentorium of the dura mater. i. At the palate. — It is then in the form of a fungous excrescence, consisting of the rudiments of a second foetus (Otto, Sandi- fort, Ehrman, Stadenski). 2. The more or less developed rudiments of a foetus adhere, in the form of a tumour, to the external surface of a second body, and aie covered by the external integu- ments. a. To the cheek. — G. Vrolik observed in a new-born male child, a sac of large circum- ference, covered by the external skin, anil ad- hering to the region of the left cheek, but without communication with the mouth. In this sac there were tuberculous cartilages, os- seous nuclei, and organised parts of indefinite form and composition. b. To the neck.— According to Joube. c. To the epigastric and umbilical region. — As recorded by E. B. Gaither. d. To the sacral and perineal region.—This is the most frequent mode of adhesion, as is proved by a great many observations, among which those of Himly and of Fleischmann deserve special mention. This adhesion takes place in different manners: 1. by external cellular tissue ; 2. by internal union with the abdominal and pelvic cavity (Himly, Schau- mann, and Stanley); 3. by communication with the spinal canal. There is sometimes no vascular communication between the foetus and its appendix (W. Vrolik) ; and in other cases there are large branches going from the arteria sacra media of the foetus to the sac. In general, the sac has its own integuments, over which passes the skin of the foetus. The genital parts and the anus are always quite separate from the sac, which merely lies in apposition with them. In the majority of the known cases, the rudiments of a foetus contained in the sac are but confused and ill-determined organic substances, intermin- gled with a few osseous and cartilaginous nuclei. In one case it was possible to recog- nise the cranium with the face and the naked encephalous masses (Wedemeyer) ; Mayer and Blizard found an intestinal loop ; Himly saw distinct super-maxillary bones, and ru- diments of temporal, frontal, and sphenoid bones, &c. If we take a survey of all the cases which are designated as foetus in fietu, it is clear that some may be compared with parasitical dis- eases formed in the interior of the body of the foetus. I presume that this is the case, when the mass which is found consists only of hair, fat, teeth, and some osseous nuclei, contained in a cystic tumour. In other cases the rudiments of a foetus are included with a more or less perfect indication of an ovum in the body of a second foetus, or adhere exter- nally to it. The large number of theories on the origin of this monstrosity have been criti- cised by Himly. It is certain that none of them can be maintained. It is most pro- bable that the fcetus in fectu is an incomplete effort to form a double monster. In this sense, some cases of fcetus in fcetu make a transition towards that form of double mon- sters which is named heteradelph, II. Double Monsters, in which one of the Foe- tuses is more or less perfect and the other merely an Appendix to it (Heterudelphi). Under this name of heteradelphs, which we owe to Geoffroy St. Hilaire, we understand that species of double monsters of which one foetus is large and perfect, and another, or part of another, adheres to it like a para- site. They should be considered as twins, of which one has been developed at the expense of the other, which other sometimes becomes partially included in its body. According to the more or less perfect state of the appen- dix, they are reduced to different species. First Species. — The appendix consisting of a head only. — This may be connected : — 1. With the epigastric region (VVinslow, Hesse), 2. With the cranium (E. Home), 3. With the back (Chabelard), 4. With the palate (Hofmann), or 5. With the under-jaw of the perfect foetus (Geoffroy St. Hilaire, G. Sandifort). Second Species. — The appendix consists of more or less developed extremities only. — Supernumerary extremities, more or less deve- loped, are connected with some part of the body of a perfect foetus, as : 1. Pelvis and two inferior extremities con- nected with the epigastric region of the per- fect foetus (Serres, E. Sandifort, Trombelli, Mayer, Winslow, Reschel, Buxtorff, Cantwell, Lycosthenes). The appendix is sometimes more, sometimes less perfect; sometimes connected with the sternum, sometimes with the epigastric region or in communication with them by a cylin- drical cutaneous prolongation. In the appen- dix are regularly formed organs of generation, kidneys, an intestinal loop in communication with the intestinal canal of the supporting fcetus, and vessels which anastomose with those of the latter. The adhering parasite is therefore one with its supporter. 2. Pelvis and the two inferior extremities connected with the lateral wall of the abdo- men of the perfect foetus (W. Vrolik). 3. Pelvis and two inferior extremities con-TERATOLOGY. 9(39 nected with the pelvis of the perfect fetus (Numan, Osiander, Haller). 4. Separate anterior or posterior extremi- ties connected with some part of the perfect foetus (W. Vrolik, Von Baer). All these varieties are indicated under the names of gastromele, pygomele, and melomele. Third Species. — The appendix is an acc- phalus with four extremities. — The union has as yet been observed only at the epigastric re- gion of the supporting fetus, through which the abdominal cavity was common to the two bodies. In the appendix the genital organs existed, but the anus was closed. In many cases, the evacuation of urine has been ob- served; the appendix showed circulation of blood; it had its own temperature, and was dependent for nutrition on the chief or perfect body. In the interior were found uropoietic organs, vessels connected with those of the chief body, and an imperfect intestinal canal (Otto, Serres). In the supporting fetus are sometimes found traces of double organs (Otto, Serres, Rosenstiel). Fourth Species. — The appendix a com- plete body with a head and four extremiti; s (Bartholinus). — This form of heteradelph makes the transition to anterior duplicity. The appendix has but to be more equally pro- portioned to the chief body, and a completely double monster is formed. The best ex- ample of this occurred in the person of a cer- tain Lazarus Colloredo, who lived for some length of time. His portrait is given by Bar- tholinus. This very peculiar appendix never took food, nor had it evacuations of faeces. But the organic and the animal life appeared to be very well developed, as its cutaneous ex- halation, its movements of different parts of its body, and the fact of its sleeping, showed. The common character, by which this whole class of heteradelphs is distinguished, consists in the comparatively smaller size, and, in ge- neral, the defective developement, of the part which is termed the parasite. Imagine this difference removed by the fuller developement of the parasite, by its obtaining all its own organic apparatus, and by its growing pari jiassu with the other, and an exact idea of complete duplicity will be formed. It will be observed also, that in the several members of this class there is a regularly graduated series, from those in which the superfluous part is only an ill-developed limb, to those in which the parasite differs from the chief in nothing but its inferior size and its depend- ence for nutrition. The cases of the last kind are, however, rare. I know but three, of which that of the said Lazarus Colloredo, de- scribed by Bartholinus, is the most remarkable. Much more commonly the parasite, even when it possesses its full numerical complement of parts, bears many signs of defective develope- ment ; it is hare-lipped, or a cyclops, or has atresia am, or some other malformation from arrest of developement. All this seems to me to [irove, that in heteradelphs there are always the rudiments of two bodies, though one or both may be defective. The beings thus formed have rarely lived man}' years after birth, and the histories of the few that have survived are, for the most part, well known in the records of medicine. Perhaps the most remarkable is that of the Chinese A-ke, of whom and his parasite little models are to be found in most of the anatomical museums of Europe. The para- site's life is, in general, only vegetative. In one of the three cases, indeed, in which it possessed all the constituent parts of a body, it moved its limbs, and appeared to have its own sensations ; but in the others, less per- fectly formed, even these signs of individual life were absent ; and in only one, that of the Chinese A-ke, had the man who bore the parasite any voluntary power over its limbs. The nutrition of the parasite appears to depend entirely on the body to which it is fixed, and through which it both receives its nutritive materials and discharges its excre- tions. The one increases and decreases in size with the other; and, of course, the para- site dies with the individual to which it is attached. The influence which, in its turn, it exercises on its supporter is not always important. In the heteradelphs that die early, death commonly ensues from the mal- formation of the main bod}'; if they survive, the parasite seems to do harm only, as an ordinaiy tumour would, by its weight, and by abstracting a certain amount of nourishment, so that those who, thus burdened, have grown up to childhood or manhood have usually been thin and delicate, like men subject to some unnatural waste. But, nevertheless, it will always be better to tolerate this evil than to risk an operation of removal, when the re- sults of all the examinations yet made prove that the parasite is deeply and by important organs connected with its supporter. The only exception which I know to the correctness of my opinion is the case in which Mr. Blizard removed, with complete success, from the sacrum of a child, a congenital tumour, which seems to have been a parasite. III. Doable Monsters. 1. Anterior duplicity. It has been already said that some of the rarer kinds of heteradelphia approximate closely to the double monsters. In all the cases that stand nearest to the transition, the parasite has been found adherent to the epi- gastric region ; and the kind of duplicity which is most closely related to them, is therefore that in which the two bodies adhere by their anterior surfaces, or what we call anterior duplicity. The most complete examples of duplicity yet known are found in this class, whose dis- tinctive characters are, that two bodies, in a state of nearly equal developement, are placed exactly opposite to one another, with their sterna connected together, and with their abdominal cavities either partially or com- pletely coalesced. Here, however, as in allTERATOLOGY. 970 the other classes, examples are found of gra- dations towards a state of singleness. For instance, the upper parts of the body being completely double, the lower are united, so that there are but three limbs, or only two lower or posterior limbs. And, in like manner, although in many cases the bodies are alike in size and other characters, yet there are many more in which one has so far surpassed the other, both in size and in stage of develope- ment, as completely to fill up the series be- tween this class and the decided heteradelphs. Whilst in the latter case we find close approxi- mations to duplicity, there are even among the most perfect double monsters peculiarities which constantly recall to mind the parasitic attachment of the heteradelphs. With this nearly perfect external duplicity there sometimes, but not always, corresponds an equal duplicity of organs. The umbilical cord may be single (Parsons, Otto), notwith- standing the heart is perfectly double. The two umbilical arteries belong but to one child ; the umbilical vein bifurcates and enters both bodies. In another case (Cruveilhier), the single umbilical cord had two veins and four arteries, and the heart was externally single, and in its internal parts imperfectly double. In a third double monster (Otto), the umbili- cal cord had five vessels, two umbilical veins, and three arteries, and in this there were two hearts. In a fourth double monster the heart and umbilical cord were single. The bond of union, as far as the skeleton is concerned, is commonly a tough fibrous connection between the lower extremities of the sterna and the ensiform cartilages, which are set directly opposite to one another. The rest of the sterna and the ribs are usu- ally distinct, and the thoracic cavities are thereby separated. In this case there are commonly two separate and perfect hearts; but in the cases in which the sterna are more completely fused, or (as happened in one case) entirely absent {Comm. Lift. 2Vo- rimberg.~), only a single heart, or one partially double, with, for instance, two ventricles and four auricles, or otherwise malformed, is Ibund. But it is particularly remarkable that in these, as in all other kinds of double monsters, there is no constant relation whatever between the respective states of the external and the in- ternal organs, for the condition of the two digestive canals, even in those which are ex- ternally almost alike, is subject to still greater varieties than the condition of the heart. The abdominal organs are always in some degree connected ; — the two livers are usually con- tinuous. A spleen, pancreas, and stomach are com- monly found in each body, and each stomach has its own duodenum, which, after some length (being continued into the jejunum) unites with the other to form a single tract of small intestine, which again divides into two canals, leading respectively to the large intestine of each body. The lungs, the urinary, and the genital systems are always double. The most remarkable example of this class was the well- known Siamese twins. When exhibited, they were not exactly opposite to each other, but stood side by side, or, rather, obliquely one by the other ; but this position, there can be little doubt, was acquired by the attempts which they had instinctively made to separate from each other in walking, or in lying and sitting down, and by the extension they had thus effected in their bond of union, which was considerably more slender than in any other yet described. It was quite impossible for them to remain always face to face; there- fore their bodies acquired an oblique direction, in which they also moved. The consequence of this was, that the right limbs of the one and the left of the other individual were the prin- cipal organs of movement; and that the inter- mediate limbs, that is to say, the left of the one and the right of the other, remained merely passive (Dubois). The one individual was stronger than the other, and seemed to over- rule him. But, nevertheless, in organic and animal relation of life they seemed to be inde- pendent of each other. Each had his own circulation of blood, his own respiration, and digestive functions. There did not seem to be a large anastomosis of vessels between the two bodies. But, by analogy with the fore- said cases, we may conclude that these twins are connected by the ends of their sterna, and by some of their abdominal organs. As a proof of this connection, may be adduced the result of the observations of Mr. Mayo, communicated at the Conversazione of the College of Physicians March 8th, 1831, that when either of the youths coughed, the bond of union swelled up in its whole length, proving that they had but one peritoneal cavity, of which a trans- verse prolongation passed through the con- necting medium. And, therefore, I should conclude, that an attempt at separation could not be made with probability of success. The probability of having to cut through a piece of liver, or a peritoneal canal, must render an operation unwarrantable, unless, indeed, after the death of one of the bodies during the healthy state of the other. The case reported by Konig has scarcely authority enough to support a contrary opinion. 2. Lateral duplicity. The varieties of form in anteriorly duplex monsters are closely limited by the partial nature of the union of the sterna and the nearly complete distinctness of the thoracic cavities, and hence of the whole upper part of the hotly. In the next class, which 1 call lateral duplicity, there is no such limit; and between the highest degree of duplicity found in it and the lowest, or that in which the duplicity is most nearly reduced to singleness, there is a far more numerous series of intermediate forms than in any other of the types of double monsters. In lateral duplicity, the two bodies are not set opposite to one another, but are turned sideways from one another. They have a common thoracic cavity, for the forma- tion of which (at least, in the highest degree of duplicity,) the right ribs of one body, andTERATOLOGY. 971 the left of the other, proceed towards the an- terior and posterior aspects, and are there connected with an anterior and posterior sternum. The best idea of the construction of this osseous fabric may be formed by sup- posing the two complete chests of two bodies to be set one against the other, and that then the anterior extremities of the right ribs of the right body, and those of the left ribs of the left body, unite with one sternum and pull it forwards, while, in the same manner, the left ribs of the right body, and the right of the left, unite on the posterior aspect with the other sternum, and carry it back- wards. The consequence is, that the two vertebral columns are turned away from one another, and that the parts above and below the thorax are double. By the formation of this common thorax, the lateral is distin- guished from the anterior duplicity, in which the thoraces are commonly connected only by the points of the sterna, and, as to their cavities, are separate. And with these diffe- rences of external construction, others not less important, of internal arrangement, coin- cide, which fully justify the separation of the two forms, however similar the external ap- pearances of many of the examples of either may be. The numerous varieties of lateral duplicity may be divided into two principal sets. The first begins with the complete duplicity of the whole body, and ends with its perfect sin- gleness ; in the second, the duplicity of the body remains, but the head gradually becomes single. The forms included herein, of which 1 have given ample accounts elsewhere, may be briefly summed up as follows. 1. Complete duplicity: — all the external parts and sometimes the abdominal and pelvic viscera double, — one common double-sized thoracic cavity, formed in the manner just described, and containing four lungs, and (in all cases with which I have been acquainted) only one heart. The examples of this form are very numerous, and are to be met with in all the large museums of Europe. 2. In the examples of this second group, which exhibits the first step towards single- ness, one of the sterna may be traced in a succession of specimens, becoming gradually narrower, and permitting a closer approxima- tion of the two corresponding upper extremi- ties, till, in some examples, they are com- pletely united, and there are found only three limbs above, with three or four below. The two juxtaposed scapula, for example, are merged into one, or they remain separate, but have only one humerus between them, and this splits below, to articulate with two fore-arms ; or there is but one fore-arm, and this bears supernumerary fingers. In short by a great variety of modes there is a general tendency towards union of two of the upper extremities. 3. In the third group we have a repetition of the same series of changes in the lower limbs, as in the second was traced in the upper ; here, as there, presenting numerous varieties, in the last and lowest of which only three lower limbs, and the third of these ill- formed, are found. 4. The third limb has now gradually disap- peared, and, with a complete duplicity above the pelvis, there are but two limbs below it, anil these well formed. In this class is placed, with many others, the Ritta-Chrhtina monster, described by Serres, which lived to eight months, and the still more remarkable ex- ample mentioned by Buchanan, of a two- headed man, 28 years old, who lived in the reign of James 111. of Scotland. 5. The union proceeding, and this simpli- city of the lower part of the body being re- tained, examples come next in which the upper parts also are united ; the two super- fluous upper limbs being united into one, pre- senting a single upper-arm, with a double fore-arm and hand, or a single upper-arm, fore-arm, and hand with ten fingers, or only a mal-formed limb, or a mere projection, occu- pying the place of the superfluous limbs. 6. Even this last indication of duplicity of the upper parts ceases, a scapula only remains, or this also is absent; and next, one of the sterna having disappeared, and the vertebral columns having been connected on the corre- sponding side by their respective ribs united into single arches, these now become gradually shorter, and the columns approach each other more and more nearly, till they are connected by only a cartilaginous substance in the place of ribs, or are at some part fused together. 7. In this next group both the upper and lower parts of the body are single ; the ver- tebral column is single below the cervical region, or exhibits only a trace of duplicity (to which something similar is often presented by the sternum), but at the cervical region becomes double, and on each portion bears a head. Of this also I have published many examples. 8. In the eighth group the extent of that cervical part of the column which is double becomes less and less. 9. In the ninth group, the two heads are seated on an apparently single neck, in which all the cervical vertebrae are single, or only bear traces of duplicity, except the first two, or the first alone. 10. Hitherto the duplicity of the head was perfect ; in this group the two heads also begin to coalesce, and, in a considerable num- ber of cases, gradations are traced in which the adjacent ears are very closely approxi- mated, and the heads are united behind. Then there are cases in which one ear only is placed between the adjacent surfaces of the two heads, and this disappears gradually, and at last totally. Next in order are the cases in which the adjacent ears being lost, the two adjacent and middle eyes first become very close, and then occupying one orbit finally coalesce. Next come those cases in which there is such a union of the heads, that the two upper jaws are articulated with one lower jaw; and, lastly, those in which the head is doubled only in individual parts or in whichTERATOLOGY. 972 there is one perfect heart, with some imperfect part or parts of another attached to it. 11. The eleventh group of this division includes the cases of lateral duplicity, in which the body is single in the middle, but doubled above and below (or in brutes ante- riorly and posteriorly). In these, which are of rarer kinds, a single neck bears two more or less completely separated heads. The vertebral column is for a considerable length single, but at its lower part again divides, and bears two sets of lower extremities. 12. In the twelfth group the body is single above and doubled below. 13. In this there is a tendency towards singleness, or even complete singleness, of the head, but all parts of the trunk and all the limbs are doubled, an arrangement by which, as al- ready stated, these form a series entirely dis- tinct from the rest. In some of these cases the two heads are found coalesced below ; in others, to which the name of janiceps has been given, one face is directed backwards and the other forwards, the remainders of the two heads being merged into one ; in others, one face is perfectly, the other very deficiently, developed ; in others there are only the indis- tinct traces of a second head presented in the existence of one or two ears on the posterior aspect of the more perfect one ; in others, this trace of duplicity is still less evident; and, lastly, in the remainder of the group, it is entirely lost, and one head only, which may be well or ill formed, is found upon the double body. 3. Inferior duplicity. My third division of double monsters in- cludes the cases in which there are two com- plete bodies with the lower portions of their respective trunks united, so that there is a head with upper extremities both above and below (the bodies being placed in the same straight line) and on either side of the part at which they meet two lower limbs. One may best conceive this arrangement by sup- posing two children stuck together by theii buttocks, and so fixed with wide-spreading lower limbs, as may be seen in^g. 146. of the second volume of this Cyclopaedia. A com- mon body is thus formed with a head at each end, with two upper limbs both above and below, and with two lower limbs, one belong- ing to each foetus on the right and two on the left of the united portions. A few cases only of this remarkable monstrosity are recorded ; and in these the duplicity was not always complete, but exhibited in some the same tendency towards singleness as was noticed in the others. Thus in some there were but three lower extremities; in others there were but two, or two with a third ill-developed on the other side: and, again, in other groups there were those which have a perfect head at one end of the trunk, but an imperfect one or none at all at the other. These monsters have been known to live a considerable time, their capacity for life being probably owing to the separation of the hearts and the absence of malformation in the more important organs of the body. The umbilical cord is single, and never has a double set of vessels ; an apparent proof (confirmed by si- milar examples in other classes) that the one body is not formed of the materials of two ; a conclusion which is supported by the coinci- dent singleness of the anus and urinary blad- der, and the union of the intestinal canals. 4. Posterior duplicity. The fourth chief form is posterior duplicity, in which two bodies are united by their backs, or a part of them. The union may be at the pelvis (which is most common), and occurred in the well-known Hungarian sisters, who lived to their twenty-second year ; or at the back of the vertebral column, or at the back part of the heads. 5. Superior duplicity. The fifth is the superior duplicity, in which the two children are connected by their skulls, the bones of which are united so as to form a single skull. In these also the place of union varies greatly. The frontal bone of one coa- lesces with the parietal or the occipital of the other, or the foreheads are attached to one another, or the side of one head to the front of the other. But all these are very rare, and of each kind only one or two examples can be found on record. All these are true double monsters. Of tripled-bodicd monsters but one instance is known in the human subject (Atti dell' Accide- ntia de Cattania, t. viii. p. 203., 1834). To conclude the description of duplicity, those which occur in individual parts of the body, the rest being single, viz. in the head, chest, abdomen, and limbs, ought to be re- corded ; such as, for example, two mouths, su- pernumerary teeth and horns, two oesophagi or duodena, double hearts, or supernumerary cavities in one heart otherwise well formed, a double penis and urethra, a double clitoris, supernumerary breasts, kidneys, vertebra, ribs, fingers, toes, or whole limbs. 13ut for all these I refer to my monograph. At present I prefer to give all those con- siderations upon the origin of double mon- sters, of which this highly interesting subject is capable. From all the facts I have published, I point out the following generalisations: — The double monsters form collectively one class of organic beings, which, however dif- ferent in their several degrees of malforma- tion, may be arranged in one continued series. As the lowest degree of duplicity, may be mentioned that of a single part of the body; for example, a double or supernumerary fin- ger; as the highest, a complete double mon- ster with two heads, four upper and four lower limbs, and two trunks, such as the Siamese twins. And between these two ex- tremes there are different forms of duplicity, which gradually run one into the other. There is no positive or constant relation between the external and the internal organs as to their degrees or modes of duplicity. In the completest duplicity of the exterior, forTERATOLOGY. 973 example, the heart is often single, or even shows signs of having been arrested in its developement; and, on the other hand, in the more nearly single forms, the heart is usually either partially or completely double. The histories of the cases of anterior and lateral duplicity, which I have given in my mono- graph, furnish abundant proofs of this. Nor is there any closer relation between the con- dition of any other internal organ and that of the exterior, than there is between it and the heart; for in nearly complete external dupli- city any of the internal organs may be single ; when there are two trunks indeed, the urinary and genital organs are commonly double ; but as for the stomach, the liver, and the lungs, the correspondence between them and exter- nal duplicity follows no other rule than that where there are two necks there are two tracheas and two oesophagi, and as a con- sequence the lungs and stomach are also dou- bled. When in like manner the stomach is double, each has its spleen and pancreas; but the state of the liver is very variable ; some- times there are two, sometimes but one with a single or double gall-bladder; and these differences often occur in the same form of external duplicity. Parts placed on the surface of the body are more liable to multiplication than the internal organs, and duplicity of a single part is there- fore much less rare than the formation of a complete double body. The upper half of the body is more frequently doubled than the lower, probably in consequence of its earlier developement and the admitted preponderance of the upper parts of the body. The union of the two bodies takes place only between similar parts. The more each of the bodies is developed, the less is the bond of union between them, as the examples of the Siamese twins and the Hungarian sisters sufficiently prove. And with this law is connected an- other, namely, that the probability of grow- in" up is greater in the same proportion as the b-ond of union is smaller, and the coin- cident fusion of internal organs less, as these two and other double monsters prove. So also the further the several organs are from the situation at which the bodies are united, the more perfect they are, — one body is almost always less developed than the other: in the heteradelphs this is al- ways the case, and in others the difference between the two bodies, though less evident, is scarcely less constant than in them. There are not commonly any signs of a double monster having been at first two individuals. For except in the cases of posterior and supe- rior duplicity, and some singular examples of attachment of the umbilical cord of one foetus to the head or the body of the other, there is never more than one placenta and one cord, and the latter usually contains only a single set of vessels, which divide when they reach the abdomen. And even in the posterior and superior varieties of duplicity it is not yet certain that there are two placenta?; in some cases the placenta was positively single, and in the remainder it has very rarely been ex- amined. A last general rule is that in double monsters the twins are of the same sex. There is no well proved exception to this important rule. What explanation can be given, after all these facts, of the origin of double monsters ? On this subject, three hypotheses ought to be mentioned : 1. The double monster has been supposed to have proceeded from two distinct embryos, which have become united in the course of development; 2. It has been held to have originated in a single germ, which has become double, or has been subdivided ; and 3. The germ has been regarded as abnormally compound from the first, implying that the organs and parts composing the double mon- ster are at once produced irom this germ, without either separation or coalition of its parts other than belong to the natural process of developement. On the comparative merits of the first and second hypotheses, as parts of the general doctrine of monsters, one of the most interesting physiological discussions extant is recorded in the Memoires de I'Aca- demie des Sciences de Paris, between 1724 and 1743. The chief disputants were Lemery and Winslow ; the contest lasted nineteen years; it engaged the attention of all anato- mists, and called forth writings by Haller and a crowd of authors of less note, and was only terminated by the death of Lemery. Every argument that could be founded on the know- ledge of those days was brought forward, and the subject was, for the time, utterly exhausted; but the facts accumulated in later years have furnished such volumes of additional evidence, that the same question, between original and acquired monstrosity, as far as it relates to double monsters, may even now claim to be discussed. It is certain that two ova may be formed in one Graafian vesicle (Von Baer, Bischoff, Bidder). The equally well-known fact, that the common fowl sometimes produces double- yolked eggs, naturally led at one time to the opinion that the formation of double monsters might be attributed to the developement and subsequent union of the embryo in each yolk ; an opinion which has been adopted by some on very insufficient grounds, as it does not appear to be warranted by any direct observ- ations made upon the result of the incubation of double-yolked eggs, and is at variance with much of what is known of the structure and mode of union of the two embryos composing a double monster.* * I have here made use of the words of Professor Allen Thompson, who, in a remarkable memoir upon double monsters, published July, 1844, in the London and Edinburgh Montldy Journal, full}' entered into the topic, and illustrated the genesis of double mon- sters by some very interesting observations. I lament that he was not acquainted with my mono- graph upon the same subject, nor with the succinct account which Mr. Paget has given of it in the British and Foreign Medical Review for October, 1841. He would have found in it a great deal in corroboration of his own opinions, in which I uni- versally agree with him.974 TERATOLOGY. C. F. Wolff has distinctly affirmed, that a double-yolked egg is equivalent to a double ovum; that the produce of its incubation would be twins ; and that a double monster can only proceed from a single yolk contain- ing a double germ. Examples of double em- bryos of birds sometimes occur at the full period of incubation, in which both are com- plete, and there is no union, excepting at the umbilicus. It is barely possible that each of these embryos may have been developed from a separate yolk, and that in the course of incubation the two yolks have come to coa- lesce, in consequence of external pressure, or other causes. Towards the conclusion of the period of incubation, when the yolk usually enters the abdomen of the fcetus, we may suppose, in the case before us, a partial en- trance of the common yolk into the abdomen of each embryo, and thus, upon the subse- quent contraction of the umbilical aperture, the union of the two embryos may be effected. We learn, from the accurately-detailed ob- servation of C. F. Wolff, previously referred to in my monograph, that two completely separate foetuses may be formed in the bird's egg upon a single yolk, and within a single germinal and vascular area. The egg, in this instance, had been incubated six days, and both the embryos were at once so com- plete and so distinct, that there is no reason to believe they would have been united till the period when the entrance of the yolk into the abdomen of both, and the contraction of the umbilical apertures, had brought them together. In a dozen double-yolked eggs, which Prof. Allen Thompson brought to incubation, he never succeeded in obtaining a double mon- ster, nor even two embryos, at the full period, from any of them. In several instances he found that one yolk only had been productive. All this proves that such double-yolked eggs may produce twins, but that the forma- tion of a double monster is not dependent on them. It is highly probable that in the same manner, in Mammalia, the arrival in the uterus of two impregnated ova, in close proximity with one another, will be attended with the production, not of a double monster, but of twins. The complete fusion of these twins seems to me quite impossible. One of my chief arguments against the hypothesis of fusion of originally separate germs is the important fact, which I derive from my own investi- gations and from those of others, that double monsters form one series, among whose seve- ral members the degrees and modes of devia- tion from singleness gradually increase, and pass, without one abrupt step, from the ad- dition of a single ill-developed limb to the nearly complete formation of two perfect beings. Now if this be true, no hypothesis can be acceptable if it do not plausibly ex- plain the origin of the whole series of double monsters, or if, though it may suffice to ex- plain the facts in one part of the series, those in another part are opposed to it. And here is a fair objection against the hypothesis of fusion of two originally perfect and separate embryos. Grant that we might explain by it the formation of several of the more perfect instances of duplicity; still, if the same hypo- thesis is altogether opposed by the simpler forms of duplicity, it is surely not tenable. For example, it cannot account for the exist- ence on a child's sacrum of a shapeless mass, containing an isolated portion of intestine, as in Mr. Hanley's case. And still less can it explain the existence of a superfluous limb ; for the limbs are mere off-shoots, and are produced at so late a period, that if we could imagine two embryos to come in contact by their shoulders or pelvis, and a fusion of those parts to take place, we should still have to explain how one of them, leaving only an arm or a leg behind him, could for the rest of his substance, head, trunk, and all, wholly dis- appear. It was a main objection against the doctrine of Lemery, that if two germs came in contact by accident (as he supposed), they could not exhibit any regularity in their mode of attach- ment, but faces would be forced into chests, abdomens into spines, and so on. The mo- derns, who adopt the same hypothesis, sup- pose that the ova come in contact not by ac- cident, but by an attraction de soi jjour soi, of which the influence is, that the two ova being by accident set face to face or back to back, or in any other way similia similibus, will be drawn to each other, and will unite by similar parts. But, with all respect for the authority of M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire and his disciples (as Mr. Paget elegantly said in his abstract of my monograph upon double monsters), who regard this as " la regie supreme de tous les arrangements et de toutes les mo- difications organiques chez les etres com- poses," I confess that I can find no good evidence that such an attraction exists. I can see in it nothing more than a very happy expression of a fact, which it in no wise ex- plains. *The extraordinary notion of MM. Delpech and Coste, that such an attraction may be the result of electric currents, is certainly no evidence of its existence, this being entirely imaginary. And the reasoning in its favour seems no better than the facts, for I can find nothing but this kind of circle: monsters adhere by similar parts, therefore there is an attraction de soi pour soi; there is then such an attraction, and therefore double monsters so adhere. I believe, therefore, that such an attraction is hypothetical; and if it be so, surely the hypothesis which involves it and an accident as essential elements is less probable, as well as less sufficient, than that which I maintain. It is scarcely better than Lemery's, of mere accident; for it requires not only the accident of a particular position of the ova, but that of their being of the same sex, which has been said previously to be the general rule for double monsters. After all this, we conclude with the words of the learned Wolff, published in 1773 : — " Patet, igitur, monstra composita non sic oriri, ut975 TERATOLOGY. aliqiiando duo separati integri embryones fue- rint, qui dein contingentes et compressi, par- tibus eorum nonnullis destructis, aliis coalitis et commixtis, concrescerent in unum novum cornpositum corpus; ea vero, quae vel defectu partium vel insolita structura monstra sunt, non ita fieri ut |)rius integri et naturales em- bryones fuerint, qui deinde per causas acci- dentals ad generationem non pertinentes mutilati vel transmutati fuerint; sed necesse esse, ut utraque monstrorum genera a pr'unis suis initiis jam ejusmodi monstra fuerint." If we are right in not admitting the exist- ence and the" fusion of two distinct germs, we necessarily adopt the opinion that only one germ has been formed, and that in this excess of formative power lies the cause and origin of every monstrous duplicity. Mr. Allan Thompson demonstrated, in coincidence with Wolff', Von Baer, and Reichert, as may be seen in the wood-cut (Jig. 029.), that From a fowTs egg after sixteen or eighteen hours' in- cubation. Magnified four times, a, the germinal area of the cicatricula ; b, the transparent area, containing two primitive traces of embryos; e e, primitive grooves of the double embryonic trace, on each side of which are seen the laminae dorsales. (After A. Thompson.) upon one yolk, and in one germinal mem- brane or blastodermatic vesicle, there may be formed, in birds, two primitive grooves, which, in their ulterior increment, shall probably form a double monster, as may be seen in a goose's egg, after five days' incubation, represented after Allan Thompson, in^. 630. By the for- mation of such a double primitive groove in a single ovum, we may explain the origin of the principal types of double monsters; and on this point a recent observation of Valentin seems particularly worthy of notice, viz. that in which an injury, inflicted on the caudal ex- tremity of an embryo on the second day, was found, on the fifth, to have produced the rudiments of a double pelvis and four in- ferior extremities. But if we admit this cause for those large and principal types, we must acknowledge that it is insufficient for the heteradelphs, and for all those cases in which, the body remaining single, some parts are Fig. G30. i_J_ h k i ' /' Double embryo removed from a goose's egg after five days' incubation.

For these the excess of formative power is the only explanation we can give. We understand, under this name, not the nisun formativus of the ancient physiologists, working as a Deus ex machina, but the physical and vital metamorphoses materia?, to which the formation of a new being ought to be attri- buted. Those who are fond of the modern nomenclature may name it, if it pleases them, typical or organic power. But enough, we admit such a power, of whatever name it may be, and contend further, that different degrees or quantities of excess lie at the origin of all the cases of double monsters, the degree of excess determining in each the degree of duplicity. If a certain excess of power be admitted capable of producing any one case of duplicity, other amounts of excess may be believed capable of producing all the other cases which differ from it only in degree ; and I meant to have proved, in my monograph, and in the succinct survey I have given of double mon- sters in this Article, that all double monsters may be referred to differences in degree of deviation from the normal singleness. But in many double monsters we see excess in one part and defect in another, so that we must suppose, in our hypothesis, that in these cases the power, more or less excessive in quantity, is also wrongly distributed. Nor is this inconceivable; for since, in the normal devt'lopemental power, we must imagine at least two elements, quantity and distribution, and must acknowledge that, for the attain- ment of a perfect result, the quantity must be distributed in definite proportions to each part, so it is not improbable that, in certain circumstances of fault in the ovum, a normal or an excessive power may be distributed dis- proportionately in the several parts. To sum up, therefore, our reasons for re- jecting the hypothesis of fusion of ova inTESTICLE (NORMAL ANATOMY). 976 favour of that of excess or irregular distri- bution of developemental power, for preferring to regard them as examples rather of single- ness tending to duplicity than of duplicity tending to singleness, are briefly these: that it is probable that the whole class of monsters by excess owe their origin to different de- grees of one common fault, and consequently that the explanation of their origin ought to be the same for all; that no kind of fusion can account for the production of super- numerary individual organs, the rest of the body being single; but that it is not impos- sible that excess of power in the ovum, which all admit can alone explain the lower degrees of duplicity, may, in proportionally higher degrees, perhaps by the formation of two primitive grooves, produce the more complete double monsters, or even two such separate individuals as are sometimes found within a single amnion.

Vrolik.) TESTICLE. — (Human Anatomy). Gr. opx's 5 Latin, Testis — Tcsticuhts; French, Tcslicule ; German, Hode ; Italian, Testicolo. The testicle is the gland by which the semen or spermatic fluid is secreted. Two in number, and contained within the scrotum, these organs are suspended at a variable and unequal distance from the abdominal rings, one testicle, generally the left, hanging a little lower than the other. This arrangement pre- vents collision between these organs when the thighs are suddenly approximated ; one tes- ticle slipping above the other, and thus elud- ing violence. In cases of transposition of the viscera and blood-vessels, it has been observed that the right testicle hangs lower than the left. The shape of the testicle of an adult is that of an oval with flattened sides. The organ has two extremities, an antero-superior, and a postero-inferior ; and two lateral surfaces. Its position in relation to the body is rather oblique, its long axis or antero-posterior di- ameter passing from above downwards and a little inwards. Its edges and sides are convex. Its upper extremity is rounded and capped by the epididymis, which rises above the body of the gland like the crest on a helmet. Ac- cording to Cruveilhier the testicle measures two inches in length, one inch in breadth, and eight lines in thickness. Sir Astley Cooper makes its long diameter two inches ; its trans- verse, an inch and a half; and its lateral, one inch and one eighth. I have found the mean dimensions of the testicle to be one inch and three quarters in length, one inch and a quarter across or in breadth, and one inch in thick- ness or from side to side. Meckel states its average weight to be four drachms, and Sir A. Cooper about an ounce. I have found the mean of these two estimates, viz. six drachms, to be the ordinary weight of the sound testicle of a healthy adult.* There are few organs subject to greater variations in size and weight than the testicle, even in men of the same age and constitution. The testicles also of the same individual rarely agree, the volume and weight of the left being, in general, greater than those of the right. I weighed the tes- ticles of six men, two of whom were killed by violence, and found the left gland heavier than the right in five; in neither of these instances, however, was the difference more than a drachm. The organ feels tense, compact, and slightly elastic. Its degree of consistence depends more on the tension of the tunica albuginea than on the proper substance of the gland. It is a good deal influenced by the quantity of seminal fluid contained in the tubular structure, and its state of activity or rest; the gland being tense and tumid when the organ is exercised and the tubuli are dis- tended, and soft and flaccid, when they are empty and the gland inactive. The parts composing the testicle may be described under four heads: — 1. The protective parts or tunics ; 2. The proper glandular or secreting structure ; 3. The excretory parts; 4. The vessels and nerves. 1. The Protective Parts or Tunics. — The Tunica Vaginalis. — This is a delicate serous membrane in the form of a shut sac, which consists of two portions ; an outer one, the parietal, which is free and loose ; and an inner, reflected, visceral or testicular portion, which closely invests the gland. The two portions are connected and continuous with each other. The outer one loosely invests the whole of the testicle except its posterior edge and inferior extremity, parts where the membrane becomes attached to the gland. It is connected with the testicle at about five lines from the lower extremity, and the junc- tion of the two portions is marked by a white and rather irregular line. The uncovered por- tion of the organ corresponds to the original attachment of the gubernaculum. On the inner side of the gland the membrane, after investing the lower part of the cord to a greater or less extent, is reflected to the epi- didymis just below its head, and to the pos- terior edge of the body of the testis, being there separated from the epididymis by the vas deferens and blood-vessels of the gland. On the outer side the membrane entirely covers and closely invests the epididymis, and forms a cul-de-sac, which isolates its mid- dle from the posterior border of the testicle, and in cases of hydrocele is often distended into a pouch. At the bottom of this sac the tunica vaginalis on the two sides comes into close contact, and sometimes there is a com- munication at this spot between the two. The smooth and polished surface of the shut sac thus formed by the tunica vaginalis is lubri- * This nearly accords with Krause's estimate (Midler's Archiv. 1837.) — who found the mean weight in five instances to be 354-4 grains, or five drachms, two scruples and fourteen grains.TESTICLE (NORMAL ANATOMY). 977 cated by an albuminous fluid, having the ordinary properties of the secretions of the other serous membranes. The office of this membrane is to facilitate the movements of the gland, so as to enable it to elude pressure and escape violence. In some adult subjects the tunica vaginalis, which was originally a process from the serous lining of the abdomen, still retains its con- nexion with that cavity. When the com- munication is free, the sac is very liable to receive a protrusion of some of the contents of the abdomen, and become the seat of con- genital hernia. Sometimes the communica- tion continues through a contracted tubular canal, which, though too narrow to admit the transit of any of the viscera, is open to the passage of fluid. In other cases the oblitera- tion is partial, one or more isolated serous sacs being left along the cord. It more often happens, however, that after the upper aper- ture of this process has closed a considerable part of it below remains unobliterated, so that the tunica vaginalis extends for some distance upwards in front of the cord. Frequently, also, although the obliteration is complete, remains of the prolongation may still be found in the form of a slender whitish filament, or fibrous process, which is lost in the areolar tissue in the anterior part of the cord, but may sometimes be traced as far as the tunica vaginalis. A small body of an irregular shape and variable size, and of a pale red or pinkish hue, is commonly found attached, often by a thin pedicle, either to the upper extremity of the testicle, or at the angle where the tunica vaginalis passes from the body of the gland to the epididymis. It is composed of a dupli- cative of this membrane, containing some fine areolar tissue and a number of small vessels. It occasionally contains a little fat. I have seen this little body in the testicle of the foetus whilst in the abdomen, and, in early life, it is often of proportionally larger size, and of a deeper red colour than in the adult. It is quite distinct from the pedunculated cysts often found attached to the head of the epididymis. This little appendage to the tunica vaginalis seems to correspond with, and to be a type of, the remarkable omental process attached to the superior part of the testicle in the Rodentia and other animals. That it is an unimportant structure in the adult, is shown by its being frequently want- ing. It may be of use, however, by slightly increasing the secernent serous surface. The tunica Albuginea, or Tunica Propria, is a dense, tough, inelastic membrane, composed almost solely of white fibrous tissue, analogous to the sclerotic coat of the eye. It completely invests the body of the testicle, but not the epididymis. Its external surface is covered by the tunica vaginalis reflexa, to which it intimately adheres. This tunic is divisible into two layers, which can be separated only by a tedious dissection, but w hich in certain animals may be detached without difficulty. The branches of the spermatic artery and VOL. IV. veins ramify in the substance of the tunica albuginea, in canals bearing in their arrange- ment some analogy to the sinuses of the dura mater, which membrane the outer layer is supposed to resemble. The smaller vessels are chiefly distributed on the inner layer, which owing to its vascularity has been com- pared to the pia mater investing the brain. At the postero-superior border of the testicle, and a little to its outer side, the tunica albu- ginea forms an internal projecting body or process, which lodges the blood-vessels and a portion of the glandular structure of the tes- ticle, called the re/e testis. This body is named, after the anatomist who first described it, the Corpus Highmori. It has since, how- ever, been called by Sir A. Cooper the medi- astinum testis, and he describes it as being formed by the tunica albuginea, which at that part is divisible into three layers. The first layer turns upon the spermatic cord, and unites with the sheath which covers the ves- sels. The second layer unites with a similar layer on the opposite side, and forms a thick substance, between the fibres of which inter- stices are left for blood-vessels and absorbents, whilst the internal layer, uniting with that on the opposite side, as well as with the preced- ing layer of the tunica albuginea, forms the process called mediastinum, which projects into the testicle between the tubuli, and it is in this substance that the seminal canals of the rete are placed. The mediastinum is therefore composed of two bodies ; the upper placed towards the spermatic cord, the lower towards the centre of the testicle : in the upper are placed the blood-vessels ; in the lower, the canals of the rete. Its length varies from six to eleven lines- II. Glandular or Secreting Structure.— The glandular part of the testicle is very simple, and its tissue is more easily demonstrated than the structure of most other glands. It consists of numerous seminiferous vessels or tubes, supplied with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. Its colour is a greyish yellow or brown, more or less tinged with blood, and is paler in infants and old men than in adults. The tubes are collected into numerous lobes or lobules, invested by a fine areolar tissue, w hich, detached from the interior of the tunica albuginea, penetrates the gland, and sends out lateral processes forming septa, which separate and sustain the lobules. These septa at their origin partake of the fibrous character of the tunica albuginea, but as they converge towards the superior border of the testicle, occupied by the corpus Highmori, they become finer, and are gradually resolved into a delicate areolar tissue. The septa are traversed by numerous blood-vessels, which minutely divide in them before being distributed on the semi- niferous tubes. Sir A. Cooper states, that the inverted portion of the tunica albuginea, forming the mediastinum testis, sends forth numerous ligamentous cords, some of which pass to the anterior edge of the testis ; whilst others form shorter processes to support and invest the lobes, being met by similar liga- 3 RTESTICLE (NORMAL ANATOMY). 978 mentous cords from the inner surface of the tunica albuginea. I have not been able to make out any such ligamentous processes passing into the substance of the testis, as are represented in Sir A. Cooper's work (part i. pi. 2. fig. 3), which I have no doubt is an ex- aggerated view of the preparation from which it was taken. The cords described appear to me to consist chiefly of blood-vessels sup- ported by slight fibrous processes from the tunica albuginea and areolar tissue. In a well- injected testicle very little tissue of the nature of ligament can be found between the lobes. The secreting structure of the testicle, like the texture of many other glands does not possess much common sensibility. When exposed in disease it may be probed and injured with the forceps without pain. Tubuli Seminiferi. — These tubes, which form by far the greatest part of the bulk of the glandular structure of the testicle, are very numerous, and radiate from all parts of the circumference of the organ towards the mediastinum, making numberless con- volutions which progressively diminish as they approach the rete testis. Two or more of the tubuli, being collected together and invested by a common tunic of con- densed areolar tissue, form a lobe or lobule of a conical form, its apex terminating at the corpus Highmori. The lobes thus formed are Fig. 631. Tlie lobes attached to the mediastinum, but artificially separated from each other. (From a preparation in the Hunterian Museum, formerly in Sir A. Cooper's collection.) not entirely distinct, but communicate with neighbouring lobes : the processes investing them are therefore incomplete, and the lobes cannot be separated from each other without division of some of the seminiferous tubuli. Krause estimates the number of the lobes as varying from 404 to 484.* The tubuli are of a white colour and uniform size, but their calibre differs in different subjects, and varies a good deal according to the age of the subject and the state of activity of the testicles, being larger in young adults and when distended with semen, than in old persons and when the gland is in a state of rest. The size of the ducts also often differs in the two testicles of the same subject. In general the calibre of the tubuli corresponds to the size of the tes- * Miiller, Archiv. fur Anatomie, 1837, s.22. tide. Observers do not exactly agree in their estimates of the diameter of the tubuli. The average diameter of the uninjected canal is estimated by Miiller at of a line; by Lauth* at yl^of an inch. Krause found the tubuli, when filled with semen, to measure about -Jg. of a line, and in old men and youths ■jij. Huschkef estimated the ordinary thick- ness of the whole tube from -L to of a line, and that of the walls from to -j-iT. Owing to the stoutness of the basement membrane, the thickness of the walls of the tubes is con- siderable as compared with the secreting ducts of other glands, and this accounts for the tubes being able to resist the pressure of a column of mercury in injections. Monro reckoned the number of the seminiferous tubes at 300; Lauth made the average num- ber 840, and he estimated the mean length of all the ducts united at 1750 feet. He found the individual ducts to vary in length, the mean being 25 inches. Krause estimated their entire length at 1015 feet. The mem- brane composing the tubuli is continuous with the mucous surface of the genito-urinary system. It is lined with epithelium, and the spermatozoa are developed from the epi- Fig. 632.

There is no appearance of an inteitubular substance ; the ducts are merely connected by a loose network of vessels, and consequently readily admit' of being sepa- rated and unravelled. The tubes, when suc- cessfully injected with quicksilver, form a beautiful anatomical preparation. Sir A. Cooper succeeded in filling the tubes with size injection ; but he has not described the mode in which it was effected, and other anatomists have failed in similar attempts.* When the tubuli seminiferi are unravelled, they are found to divide and form numerous anastamoses, which increase in frequency to- wards the circumference of the testicle. (See diagram, fig. 633. a1 a1). The tubuli thus form one vast network of communication, so that it is impossible to isolate completely either a duct or a lobule. The credit of making this interest- ing discovery of the anastamoses of the se- minal tubes is due to Lauth. In only one instance did he succeed in finding a duct, ter- minating in a blind pouch, and this he regarded as exceptional. Blind ends have been found, however, more frequently by Krause. The anastamoses of the tubules have been observed in the rat and other animals as well as in man. The convolutions of the seminal tubes di- minish in number as they approach the me- diastinum, and cease altogether at a distance of from one to two lines, where two or more unite to form a single straight duct, termed vas rectum, which joins the rete testis at a right angle (a1 a2). The vasa recta are very slender, and easily give way when injected : their calibre, which is greater than that of the seminal tubes, is estimated by Lauth at -j^th Fig. 633.

Haller reckoned their number at twenty, which is, however, too few. Rete Testis, as its name implies, consists of a plexus of seminal tubes, which occupies the corpus Highmori, or mediastinum testis. The vasa recta, after penetrating the walls of this body, terminate in from seven to thirteen ves- sels which, running parallel to each other in a waving course, and frequently dividing and anastomosing, form the rele testis, (b). Lauth found the mean diameter of the vessels of the rete in injected preparations TV of an inch. According to Prochaska, these vessels are supplied with valves, but such is not the case. Small dilatations, however, are often found in different parts of the plexus. III. The Excretory Parts.—The epididymis, a continuation of the testicle, is a body of a crescentic form, divided into an anterior and upper extremity, called head, or globus major, which is firmly attached to the testicle ; a middle part or body, which is less in size, and separated from the gland by a pouch of the tunica vaginalis; and a tail or globus minor, connected to the testicle by areolar tissue. The volume and weight of the epididymis vary in different subjects, but are proportionate to the size of the testicle. It is longer than the testicle, measuring about two inches in length and four or five lines in width. Its name (from eVl upon, and 5'iSv/j.os testis,) indi- cates its position, which is along the postero- superior border of the gland. The epididy- mis is chiefly made up of seminal canals connected and supported by a firm resisting areolar tissue. The ducts which spring from the upper part of the rete testis to form the epididymis are termed vasa effercntia. They are usually about twelve or fourteen in num- ber, but vary from nine to thirty. The inflec- tions of each of these efferent ducts are so arranged as to form in the head of the epidi- dymis a series of elongated conical figures called coni vasculosi. These ducts, at their commencement, run straight for a distance of about one or two lines, when they form con- volutions which become more numerous and close as the ducts recede from the testicle. Their length varies, the upper being the shortest. Lauth found their average length to be seven inches four lines, and calculating their number at thirteen, he makes the united length of the vasa efferentia nearly eight feet. He states that the efferent ducts diminish in size from their commencement to their ter- mination in the canal of the epididymis, where they are less than the seminiferous ducts of the testicle. (Fig. 634.) As in the rete, round dilatations of variable size are often met with in these ducts. (Fig. 632., e e.) The efferent ducts, after forming the coni vasculosi, successively join a single duct, the canal of the epididymis, at irregular distances, the intermediate portions of the duct varying in length from half an inch to six inches. The efferent ducts are more slender than the canal of the epididymis, and frequently give way under the pressure of the column of mer- cury when injected.

Monro described this canal as gradually increasing in size from the head to the tail, and he estimated its calibre about its middle at of an inch. Lauth states that its size is subject to great irregularities in different parts and in different subjects. This anatomist has particularly described the con- volutions of this duct, and has shown that they are regularly arranged in four series, which successively increase in size ; the first being the smallest, and the fourth the largest. The arrangement will be understood by reference to the subjoined figure. Monro estimated the length of the canal at thirty feet eleven inches. Lauth found its mean length to be nineteen feet four inches eight lines. The parietes of the canal are strong, and bear considerable resistance. The canal of the epididymis ter- minates in the excretory duct of the testicle, the vas deferens, and is usually contracted at the part where the two join, which accounts for the mercury when forced into the vas de- ferens being often arrested at this point. It was calculated by Monro that the semen, be- fore arriving at the vas deferens traverses a tube forty-two feet in length. Lauth, how- ever, makes the whole distance but little more than twenty-two feet. Vasculum aberrans.— This name was given by Haller to a blind duct or ccecal appendage Canal of the epididymis partly unravelled, to show the four series of inflections which the duct undergoes in the several divisions of the epididymis. o, o, first series of inflections; p, p, second series; q, q, third series ; r, r, fourth series. {After Lauth). termination of the former in the latter. (Figs. 632., and 633, h.) It forms a convoluted duct as large as the canal of the epididymis, which is contracted at its insertion, and ter- minates in a blind and often dilated extremity. Sometimes after being dilated for a certain distance it diminishes, and becoming very minute, is lost in the areolar tissue of the cord. It usually passes up the cord for about two or three inches, but has been found to extend as far up as the brim of the pelvis. The length of this appendage when unravelled varies from one to twelve or fourteen inches. The vasculum aberrans is not constantly pre- sent ; indeed, Monro found it only four times in sixteen ; but I believe, with Lauth, that it exists more frequently. Occasionally there is more than one, and as many as three have been found both by Lauth and Sir A. Cooper. Hunter regarded these ducts as supernumerary vasa deferentia, of a nature similar to the double ureters.* Muller states that their office is evidently the secretion of a fluid which they pour into the epididymis, f We have no evidence, however, that the duct serves any particular office. Vas deferens,— the excretory duct of the testicle, commences from the tail of the epidi- dymis, and terminates in one of the ejacu- latory canals behind the bladder, being in length from fifteen to sixteen inches. Arising * Works by Palmer, vol. iv. p. 24.981 TESTICLE (NORMAL ANATOMY). 3 R 3 from the contracted part of the canal of the epididymis at an acute angle, it ascends along the inner side of this body, from which it is separated by areolar tissue and the spermatic arteries and veins. A right or left testicle may thus always be distinguished by the circum- stance that when the testicle is in position, the vas deferens is situated on the inner or mesial side of the organ. In this part of its course, for the distance of about an inch and a half, or more, the vas deferens forms numer- ous convolutions, (Jig*- 632., and 633, i), which gradually cease as the duct mounts above the testicle. The inflected part of the vas deferens, when unravelled, was found by Lauth to measure six inches and a half. It afterwards takes a direct course (Jc) up the spermatic cord to the inguinal canal, passing behind and at a short distance from the spermatic arteries and veins. On entering the abdomen at the internal ring, it quits the spermatic vessels and descends into the pelvis, passing at first by the side of, and afterwards behind and below the bladder, on the inner side of the corresponding vesicula seminalis, the excretory duct of which it joins at an acute angle, to form the ejaculatory canal. The canal of the vas deferens is extremely fine, and its walls are nearly uniform in thick- ness until it reaches the vesicula seminalis. It is lined by a fine membrane of a mucous character, which is continuous with the urethra. This membrane forms longitudinal folds. The vas deferens is round and in- durated,— harder than any other excretory duct in the body, by which character it is easily distinguished, when handled, from the other parts constituting the spermatic cord. Many anatomists have entertained the opinion that the parietes of this duct are muscular. It is distinctly so in the bear, bull, and other animals. On careful examination, however, of sections of the human vas deferens with the microscope, I could discover nothing more than simple fibrous tissue. Huschke makes three layers of fibres ; two longitudinal, and one circular, situated between them ; the latter being the thickest. The duct has an external investment of condensed areolar tissue. IV. The Vessels and Nerves. — Spermatic Vessels. ■— The spermatic arteries, the chief vessels supplying the testicles, arise in pairs, at a very acute angle, from the fore-part of the aorta, immediately below the renal ar- teries. Their origin is subject to consider- able varieties. The two seldom arise at the same level, and the right is often a branch of the right renal artery. Sometimes one or both come off from the superior mesenteric. Occasionally there are two spermatic arteries on one or both sides, arising in the regular way. All these deviations are more frequently met with on the left than on the right side of the body. Each artery pursues a tortuous course downwards and outwards, passing behind the peritoneum obliquely across the psoas muscle and ureter, to which, as well as to the surrounding areolar tissue, it gives off several branches. The artery then enters the inguinal canal through the internal ring, and emerging at the external, passes down the cord, being surrounded in its course by the spermatic veins. The further distribution of the artery is thus correctly described by Sir A. Cooper : " When the artery reaches from one to three inches from the epididymis, varying in different subjects, it divides into two branches, which descend to the testicle on its inner side, opposite to that on which the epididymis is placed; one passing on the anterior and upper, the other to the posterior and lower part of the testis. From the anterior branch the vessels of the epididymis arise: first, one which passes to its caput; secondly, another to its body, and, thirdly, one to its cauda and the first convolutions of the vas deferens, communicating freely with the de- ferential artery. The spermatic artery, after giving off branches to the epididj mis, enters the testis, by penetrating the outer layer of the tunica albuginea ; and dividing upon its vascular layer, they form an arch by their junction at the lower part of the testis, from which numerous vessels pass upwards ; and then descending, they supply the lubes of the tubuli seminiferi. Besides this lower arch, there is another passing in the direction of the rete, extremely convoluted in its course, and forming an anastomosis between the prin- cipal branches.'' The testis receives a further supply of blood from anothe1' vessel, the ar- tery of the vas deferens, or posterior spermatic artery, which arises from one of the vesical arteries, branches of the internal iliac. This artery divides into two sets of branches, one set descending to the vesicula seminalis and to the termination of the vas deferens ; the other, ascending upon the vas deferens, runs in a serpentine direction upon the coat of that vessel, passing through the whole length of the spermatic cord ; and when it reaches the cauda epididymis, it divides into two sets of branches, one advancing to unite with the spermatic artery to supply the testis and epi- didymis, the other passing backwards to the tunica vaginalis and cremaster. The spermatic veins spring in three sets from the testicle, one from the rete and tubuli, and another from the vascular layer of the tunica albuginea, and a third from the lower extremity of the vas deferens. The veins of the testicle pass in three courses into the beginning of the spermatic cord ; two of these quit the back of the testicle, one at its anterior and upper part, and a second at its centre; and these, after passing from two or three inches, become united into one. The other column accompanies the vas deferens. There is also a large vein, just above the testicle, which crosses to join the three columns. The veins of the epididymis are one from the caput, another from its body ; one from its cauda, and another from its junction with the vas deferens, besides some small branches ; they terminate in the veins of the spermatic cord. The veins, after quitting the testicle, become extremely tortuous, and frequentlyTESTICLE (NORMAL ANATOMY). 9S2 divide and inosculate in the cord, forming a plexus termed vasa pampiniformia. These communications cease as the veins approach the ring, which they enter, and ascending along with the psoas muscle in company with the spermatic artery, unite to form a single vein which usually terminates on the right side in the vena cava inferior, and on the left, in the renal vein ; though this is subject to some variety. The left spermatic veins pass under the sigmoid flexure of the colon. Many anatomists speak of the spermatic veins as being destitute of valves, which they assign as one of the reasons for the occurrence of varicocele. I have several times injected these veins with alcohol, and on laying them open have observed valves in the larger vessels, and I have also found injections thrown into the veins arrested by the valves. They are seldom seen, however, very near the testicle, or in the smaller veins forming the plexus; nor have 1 observed them within the ab- domen. Absorbents. — The absorbent vessels of the testicle are very numerous, and arise from every part of its internal structure and coats. They unite to form four or five trunks, which ascend along the cord, and traverse the in- guinal canal, without communicating with the glands in the groin, but pass upwards in front of the psoas muscle, behind the peritoneum, and terminate in the lumbar glands on the side of the aorta. Nerves. — The nerves of the testicle are derived chiefly from the renal plexus, but partly also from the superior mesenteric and aortic plexuses. These nerves descend in company with the spermatic artery to the cord, where, being joined by branches from the hypogastric plexus, which pass along the vas deferens, they form together the spermatic plexus, the branches of which are intermingled with the vessels of the cord, and ultimately terminate in the substance of the testicle. A few twigs from the external spermatic nerve may also be traced to the coverings of the gland. The Testicle in the Foetus, and its Passnge into the Scrotum. — The testicles are first de- veloped and situated in the abdomen. They originate from the lower part of the corpora Wolffiana, and may be detected at an early period of foetal existence immediately below the kidneys on the forepart of the psoas muscles, to which they are attached by a reflexion of peritoneum. This membrane closely invests the testicles in the same man- ner as it covers the other abdominal viscera. The position of the testicle in the abdomen is nearly the same as it maintains after its passage into the scrotum. The epididymis, however, is relatively of a larger size than in the adult, being about one-third that of the body of the organ. Attached to each testicle whilst in the abdomen is a peculiar body, which was termed by Mr. Hunter, who first described it, the gubcrnaculum, as it was sup- posed to serve as a guide to the testicle in its passage. It is a soft solid projecting body of a conical form, which varies somewhat in shape and size at different periods of transi- tion of the testes, becoming shorter and thicker as the gland approaches the abdo- minal ring. It is situated in front of the psoas muscle, to which it is connected by a reflexion of peritoneum. Its upper part is attached to the inferior extremity of the testicle, lower end of the epididymis, and commencement of the vas deferens. The lower part of this process passes out of the abdomen at the abdominal ring, and diminishing in substance and spreading, terminates in three processes, each of which has a distinct attachment. The central part and bulk of the gubernaculum is composed of a soft, transparent, gelatinous substance, which, on examination by the mi- croscope, is found to consist of nucleated cells, the primitive areolar tissue : this central mass is surrounded by a layer of well-deve- loped muscular fibres, which may be distin- guished by the naked eye, and which can be very distinctly recognised in the microscope to be composed of striped elementary fibres. These muscular fibres, which may be traced the whole way from the ring to the testicle, are surrounded by a layer of the soft elements of the areolar tissue, similar to that composing the central mass ; and, in the same way as the testicle, the whole process, except at its pos- terior part, is invested with peritoneum. On carefully laying open the inguinal canal, and gently drawing up the gubernaculum, the muscular fibres may be traced to the three processes, which are attached as follows : the external and broadest is connected to Pou- part's ligament in the inguinal canal; the middle forms a lengthened band which escapes at the external abdominal ring, and passes to the bottom of the scrotum, where it joins the dartos ; the internal takes the direction in- wards, and has a firm attachment to the os pubis and sheath of the rectus muscle. Be- sides these, a number of muscular fibres are reflected from the internal oblique on the front of the gubernaculum. It thus appears, that the attachments of the muscle of the guber- naculum, and those of the cremaster in the adult are exactly similar. I have succeeded in tracing out the former before the testicle has moved from its original position, at dif- ferent stages of the process of transition, anil immediately after its completion ; and of the identity of the two muscles no doubt can be entertained. Carus was of opinion that the cremaster does not exist before the transition of the testicle; but that it is formed mecha- nically, by the testicle pushing before it the lower fibres of the internal oblique, so as to form the loops of this muscle.* This view which has been adopted by M. Jules Cloquet, and after him by many of the anatomists of this country, is erroneous and inaccurate.f The vessels of the testicle in the foetus * Compartive Anatomy, by Gore, vol. 2. p. 347. t Vide Obervations on the Structure of the Gu- bernaculum, and on the Descent of the Testis in the Foetus, by the author, in Lond.

The artery of the vas deferens, from which the gubernaculum is chiefly sup- plied, is nearly as large as the spermatic. The long course taken by the arteries and veins of the testicle when in the scrotum is thus ex- plained by the original site of the organ, to which circumstance must also be ascribed the sharp turn upwards of the vas deferens from the epididymis, the two being continuous in a direct line, whilst the testicle is in the ab- domen.

Between the fifth and sixth month of fcetal existence, sometimes later, the testicle begins to move from its situation near the kidney towards the ring, which it usually reaches about the seventh month. During the eighth month it generally traverses the inguinal canal, and by the end of the ninth arrives at the bottom of the scrotum, in which situation it is commonly found at birth. The testicle, both during its passage to the ring and through the inguinal canal, carries along with it its original peritoneal coat, adhering by the reflexion of this membrane, during the whole of its course to the parts behind, in the same manner as whilst situated below the kidney. The testicle therefore does not pass directly and abruptly into a pouch prepared to receive it, but carries the peritoneum with it, con- tinuing to be connected to the parts behind by the reflexion of the membrane, between the folds of which the vessels and nerves join the gland. In the passage of the testicle from the abdomen to the bottom of the scrotum, the gubernaculum, including its peritoneal investment and muscular fibres, undergoes the same change as that which takes place in certain of the rodentia at the access of the season of sexual excitement; the muscle of the testicle is gradually everted, until, when the transition is completed, it forms a mus- cular envelope external to the process of peri- toneum, which surrounds the gland and front of the cord. As the testicle approaches the bottom of the scrotum, the gubernaculum di- minishes in size, owing to a change in the dis- position of its areolar elements ; the muscular fibres, however, undergo little or no diminu- tion, and are very distinct around the tunica vaginalis in the recently descended testicle. The mass composing the central part of the gubernaculum which is so soft, lax, and yield- ing, as in every way to facilitate these changes, becomes gradually diffused, and after the arrival of the testicle in the scrotum, contri- butes to form the loose areolar tissue which afterwards exists so abundantly in this part; the middle attachment of the gubernaculum, which may be traced to the dartos at the bottom of the scrotum, gradually wastes away and soon becomes indistinct, though slight traces of this process often remain to the latest period of life. Thus, after death, in dragging the testicle of an adult out of the scrotum by pulling the cord, the lower part of the gland, which is uncovered by serous membrane, is often found connected to the bottom of the scrotum by a band of firm and dense areolar tissue, which requires division with the scalpel. This band is the remains of the middle attachment of the gubernaculum. In cases in which the testicle has been re- tained in the groin, I have traced a cord of dense tissue from the gland to the lower part of the scrotum. After the arrival of the tes- ticle in the scrotum, the peritoneum with which it is closely invested, its original en- velope, becomes the inner layer of the tunica vaginalis ; whilst the pouch around, which is continuous with it, forms the outer layer, or vaginal sac. Immediately after the arrival of the testicle in the scrotum, this bag commu- nicates with the abdomen, and in quadrupeds continues to do so during life; but in the human subject it soon begins to close, and when the foetus is ushered into the world, the abdominal orifice is often shut, and the whole canal from the ring to the upper part of the gland is, in general, completely obli- terated in the course of the first month after birth. The obliteration is effected by an intimate union of the surfaces of the serous membrane. It sometimes does not take place at all*, or is delayed or only partially com- ing. 637.

Congenital hernia, or hydrocele is the result of a failure in this process ; and other forms of hydrocele are occasioned by imperfect obliteration of the canal. Much difference of opinion exists as to the immediate cause of the transition of the tes- ticle. Hunter, Meckel, and others came to the conclusion that the muscular fibres of the cremaster are insufficient to bring the testicle further than the abdominal ring and complete the passage. They were not, however, ac- quainted with the attachment of this muscle to the pubis external to the ring, or it would be difficult to understand why Mr. Hunter, after arriving at the conviction that the cremaster passes to the testicle whilst in the abdomen, chiefly from analogy, was not induced by the same process of reasoning to conclude, that a muscle capable of changing the position of the testicle in brute animals, would be ade- quate to accomplish the same office in the human foetus. The necessity for some active agent to effect this change in the latter would appear to be greater even than in the lower animals, since, in the usual position of the foetus in utero, the passage of the testicle is contrary to gravitation,* and unaided by the movements of respiration. Now, when we consider the attachments and connec- tions of this muscle in the foetus; the per- fect development of its fibres, as ascertained by microscopical examination ; and the circum- stance that there are no other means, no other motive powers, by which this change can be effected, or in any way promoted, 1 think there is no reason to doubt that the cremaster ex- ecutes the same office in the human embryo, as that which it undoubtedly performs in cer- tain brute animals at a particular season. The fibres proceeding from Poupart's liga- ment, and the obliquus internus, tend to guide the gland into the inguinal canal ; those at- tached to the os pubis to draw it outside the abdominal ring ; and the process extend- ing to the bottom of the scrotum, to direct it to its final destination. As the process ap- proaches completion, the muscular fibres which perform so important a part in it gra- dually become everted, and acquire the new functions of elevating, supporting, and com- pressing the gland. The Functions of the Testicle. — The sperm or fluid secreted by the testicle has been con- sidered in the article (Semen). On survey- ing the structure of this gland, we cannot fail to remark the great extent of secreting surface afforded by the numerous, long, and tortuous tubuli, and the length and complexity of the excretory duct through which the seminal fluid has to pass. The extent of this duct is, indeed, so remarkable, that many physiologists have been led to suppose that the semen is Owen, being the only brute animal in wliich the tunica vaginalis forms a shut sac. * For this reason I have departed from the usual custom of English anatomists, and avoided describ- ing the change in the position of the testicle, as the descent. further elaborated or perfected in its passage through the convolutions constituting the epididymis. An examination of the spermatic fluid taken from the testicle and its duct both in man and in the lower animals, under all circumstances and at all periods, and the varying state of the discharge in cases of spermatic fistula, leave little room to doubt that secretion takes place actively only dur- ing the periods of sexual excitement, or under the influence of sexual feelings and desires. From birth to the period of puberty the testicles remain small, and grow but little in proportion to other parts ; but as the body, on the arrival of puberty, becomes stamped with the characters of the male sex, they rapidly enlarge, their glandular structure becomes much more developed, and, being excited, these organs begin to exercise the office of secretion, no spermatozoa being founa in them until this period arrives. The age at which the testicles thus become developed varies in different climates, and in different constitutions, and is influenced by the mode of life and circumstances in which the indivi- dual is placed. The inhabitants of warm climates reach the age of puberty earlier than those of cold countries. In this part of Europe the change takes place from the age of fourteen to seventeen years, according to circumstances. Unlike the inferior ani- mals, the testicles in man are ready at all seasons to perform their office. The de- sires subside, and the secretion of semen be- comes languid as life advances, though they seldom cease entirely till the age of sixty-five or seventy. Indeed, I have several times dis- covered spermatozoa in the testicles of men upwards of seventy years of age, and once in the testicle of a tailor who died at the age of eighty-seven. There are instances on record of persons retaining the procreative faculty to the age of one hundred years ; but in these cases, as in the well-known instance of old Parr, the general bodily powers were also pre- served in a very extraordinary degree.* " To the use of the sexual organs for the continuance of his race man is prompted by a powerful instinctive desire, which he shares with the lower animals. This instinct is ex- cited by sensations, and these may either ori- ginate in the sexual organs themselves or may be excited through the organs of special sen- sation. Thus in man it is most powerfully aroused by impressions conveyed through the sight or the touch : in many other animals, the auditory and olfactive organs communi- cate impressions which have an equal power ; and it is not improbable that in certain mor- bidly excited suites of feeling, the same may be the case in ourselves. That local impres- * Old Parr, who lived to the great age of 152, was dissected by the celebrated Harvey, and it is stated, "Genitalibus erat integris, neque retructo pene neque extenuato, neque scroto distento ramice aquoso ut in decrepitis solet, testiculis etiam inte- gris et magnis." Bettus de Ortu et Natura San- guinis, p. 320.98j TESTICLE (NORMAL ANATOMY). sions have also very powerful effect in excit- ing sexual desire must have been within the experience of almost every one ; the fact is most remarkable, however, in cases of saty- riasis ; which disease is generally found to be connected with some obvious cause of irrita- tion of the generative system, such as pruri- tus, active congestion," &c. * The part of the brain which is the seat of the sexual appetite is supposed by the phrenolo- gists to be the cerebellum, between which and the genital organs a close sympathy is said to exist. The grounds for this assumption, and the objections which have been fairly urged against it by sound physiologists, have been stated in a preceding article. (Nervous Sys- tem, Physiology of, vol. iii. p. 782. s.) No doubt, however, can be entertained that the mind is intimately connected with the procre- ative faculty, and that the brain controls and animates the desire for sexual enjoyment. An affection of the brain, or the mind, as sudden disgust, arrests the secretion of the testicles and extinguishes all desire as quickly and effectually as a strong mental impression stops the secretion of the gastric juice, and takes away all appetite for food. The influence of the brain on the reproductive function is well illustrated by the occasional effects of injuries of the head. Hildanus mentions the case of a man accused of impotency by his wife, who sued for a divorce. Nothing external was de- fective ; but the man stated that eight years previously he had received a blow on his head by a stick. From that period, " confitebatur penem erigi non posse."-)- Dr. Fisher relates the case of a gentleman who, while looking out of the window of a railway carriage, which at that moment encountered a violent collision, received a blow on the head and neck, by which he was stunned. On the se- cond day after the accident he complained of a numbness in his right arm, and experienced difficulty in passing his urine. In the course of two weeks he was able to leave his bed, and walk in the street ; but his vision was defective. Between the fourth and fifth week after his injury he made the discovery that he had lost the desire and physical power for sexual intercourse, and that no amorous sentiment, or the approach of a female could excite it. Under appropriate treatment the bladder gradually recovered its power, and his vision became perfect; but the numbness of the right arm continued, and the generative functions remained partially impaired. His mental powers, particularly his memory of events, were also for a time seriously affected.£ Dr. Gall mentions that at Vienna he was con- sulted by two officers who had become im- potent in consequence of blows from fire-arms which had grazed the napes of their necks. One of the officers recovered his powers by * Dr. Carpenter's Principles of Human Physio- logy, p. 619. f Opera Observationura et Curatiouum Medico- Chirurgicarum, p. 574. X Case by L>r. Fisher. American Journal of the Medical Sciences, Feb. 1839. p. 857. degrees, married, and became the father of several children.* When treating of Atrophy of these glands, I shall have occasion to mention cases in which the genital function has been perma- nently annihilated, and complete wasting of the testicles has resulted from injuries of the head. In respect to the mode in which these organs are called into action, they bear consi- derable analogy to the lachrymal, salivary, and mammary glands, in which secretion is excited both by the influence of the mind and by me- chanical contact or local irritation of the ex- tremity of the excretory duct, the glans penis holding the same relation to the testicle as the mucous membrane of the mouth does to the salivary glands, or as the nipple does to the mamma. The influence of the testicles and brain upon each other appears, as has been already observed, to be reciprocal; for not only may desire be aroused by local irritation and ex- citing the testicles to secrete, but the passion itself never arises when these glands are re- moved before puberty and is extinguished by their extirpation afterwards. Nothing, indeed, illustrates more forcibly the intimate relation which the functions of the testicles bear to the mind and character of the individual, and the general organisation of the body, than the effects of castration. When it is performed in early life, the changes characteristic of puberty never ensue. There is a deficiency of the beard; the muscles do not acquire the manly tone and vigour ; the areolar and adipose tissues abound ; the voice retains the high and clear tones of infancy ; and the mind remains deficient in energy and strength. When the testicles are removed after the period of puberty, the eunuch loses in part, though not entirely, his former masculine character. His beard grows less abundantly; his voice becomes shrill; and there is di- minished energy and vigour in all his senti- ments and actions. These changes in the con- stitution, as well as the loss of the sexual instinct which occur in men thus degraded, do not immediately succeed the removal of the testicles, but take place gradually ; and there are well-attested cases in which desire has been experienced, and connection with emis- sion accomplished many months after the loss of these organs. This shows that the passion is not solely dependent on the secretion of semen, though it invariably declines when the power of procreation becomes lost. The emis- sions in such cases are imperfect and fruitless, consisting merely of the secretions of the vesiculse seminales anil prostrate. The testi- cles not being parts essential to life, are sub- ject to different laws from those which re- gulate the actions of the vital organs. Their functions may be suspended, or they may remain in abeyance for an indefinite period without injury to the glands or any material effect on the constitution. In persons of * On the Functions of the Cerebellum, tr. by Combe, p. 46.986 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). recluse and studious habits the functions of these organs often continue dormant for years. Like the mammae in the unmarried female, though inactive, they remain sound and competent for secretion when duly ex- cited and called upon to exercise their func- tions. It often happens that the passions are excited without an opportunity being afforded for their gratification. Under these circum- stances the testicles become encumbered with secretion which would prove injurious to them were they not relieved by occasional nocturnal emission, or ejaculations of the semen under the influence of dreams during sleep, which appear to be a salutary provision to obviate the inconveniences which might result as well from ungratified desires as from an accumulation of semen in the ducts. Envelopes of the testicle.—The scrotum, or pouch of integument containing the testicles, including the dartos, has already been de- scribed. (Article Scrotum). Superficial or external spermatic fascia. — Beneath the loose areolar tissue of the scro- tum is situated a delicate layer of fascia, which is continuous with the superficial fascia of the lower part of the abdominal parietes, and, descending so as to form a sheath to the spermatic cord and an envelope to the testicle, becomes continuous behind with the super- ficial fascia of the perineum. This fascia is usually very thick and distinct in cases of large and old scrotal hernia. Crcmaster muscle — Directly beneath the superficial fascia is found the cremaster muscle (so named from Kpzuaai to suspend), or, as it has been appropriately termed by Mr. Hunter, the musculus testis. (For description, vide, Abdomen, vol.i. p. 6.) The two attachments of this muscle, the external to Poupart's ligament, and the internal to the os pubis, correspond, as I have previously (p. 983.) shown, to those of the muscle of the gubernaculum, being indeed the same structure, with its relations altered. The actions of the cremaster, which, with a few exceptions, are involuntary, appear to be those of giving a tonic support to the testicles, retracting them to the abdominal rings, and compressing them during the sexual act. In some instances, in boys before the approach of puberty, this muscle has been capable of drawing the gland up into the in- guinal canal. Persons are occasionally met with who possess a voluntary power over its actions in various degrees of perfection. Some are able to elevate the testicle on one side but not on the other, whilst others can retract both testicles to the abdominal rings, and retain them there at will. A very remarkable instance of the cremaster muscle being com- pletely under the influence of volition is recorded by Mr. Hutchinson.* Deep spermatic fascia. — The tunica vagi- nalis and spermatic cord are invested by a thin delicate fascia, which is situated beneath the cremaster muscle, and forms a common * Practical Observations in Surgery, second edit, p. 13ft. fibrous envelope to the testicle, and spermatic cord. It is attached to the back part of the gland. This membrane may be traced as a prolongation of the fascia transversalis, and is probably formed in the process of transition of the testicle from the abdomen to the scrotum. The spermatic cord. — The parts composing the spermatic cord, are the vas deferens, the artery of the duct, the spermatic artery and veins, the lymphatic vessels, and the spermatic nerves. These parts are connected by loose areolar tissue. A fibro-cellular process, being the remains of the process of serous membrane originally connecting the tunica vaginalis with the peritoneum, may sometimes be perceived in the front part of the cord. The spermatic cord extends from the internal abdominal ring to the back part of the testicle. Its upper portion, therefore, lies in the inguinal canal. The coverings of the cord are the same as those of the testicle : viz., the inte- guments, superficial fascia, cremaster muscle, and deep spermatic fascia. For Comparative Anatomy, see the article Organs of Generation. Abnormal Anatomy of the Testicle.— Congenital imperfections and malformations.— Numerical excesses and defects. — Cases of su- pernumerary testicles are mentioned in the writings of the old authors, and persons have been described with four or five of them, ac- companied with a proportionate increase in the venereal appetite. Nearly all these cases are of a fabulous character. Such must be remarked of the case of TrevrSpxos, or man with five tes- ticles, mentioned by Schaarf*, and with that of a man with four testicles alluded to by Blegny.-|- Blasius, an old writer not un- worthy of credit, has, however, given an account of the examination of a man, thirty years of age, and otherwise well formed, who had two testicles on the right side, of the same size and shape as that on the left, which is illustrated by a small engraved figure re- presenting a distinct artery from the aorta, and vein from the vena cava proceeding to each of the two testicles on the right side.J This is the only case of supernumerary testicle recorded by the old authors, which has any semblance of authenticity. Neither Morgagni, Haller, nor Meckel met with a single exam- ple, and they questioned the existence of such a condition. Two cases have recently been recorded as examples of triple testicle, but they were not verified by examination after death. One is related by Bliimener, an army surgeon, in Rusts Magazin fur die Gesammte Heilkunde for 1824: the other by Dr. Macann, a British surgeon. $ An epi- plocele, a fatty or fibrous tumour in the scrotum, or an encysted hydrocele of the cord, * Eph.

Morgagni mentions that he was once deceived by a portion of omentum. In the pathological collection at St. Thomas's Hos- pital is preserved the testicle of the eccentric Dr. Monsey, who appeared during life to be supplied with three of these glands. The sup- posed additional testicle consists of an in- durated fibrous tumour attached apparently to the tunica vaginalis. Many instances of monorchides, or persons having only a single testicle are also mentioned by the old authors ; but as the data are very imperfect, and as little was known respecting the transition of the testicle at the time these cases were recorded, they must be viewed with great suspicion. They were most pro- bably cases in which one of the glands was either retained within the abdomen, or, from some cause had been completely atrophied. I know no satisfactory reason why a defici- ency of one or both testicles should not occasionally occur without any other mal- formation ; but they are anomalies of which there are few authentic examples in the annals of medical science. Mr. Paget has published the particulars of a case in which he believes one testicle was deficient at birth.* No account of the man is attached to the particulars of the dissection, and it is open to question whether the deficiency of the gland was not the result of atrophy. Dr. Fisher, of Boston f, has recorded a more satisfactory example of absence of both testicles. The de^ ficiency was remarked from birth, and the sub- ject of the malformation was regarded as a na- tural eunuch, and died at the age of forty-five. Mr. Thurnham has published an account of the dissection of an infant who died at the age of four months. In addition to an atrophied condition of the right kidney, and a remark- able malformation of the ureters.it was found that neither of the testicles had descended. The right lay in the abdominal cavity, just above the inguinal canal. On the left side no testicle would appear to have been formed; the spermatic vessels on this side terminated in a little mass of fat ; the vas deferens, how- ever, was present, and was apparently as well developed as that of the perfect testicle. J A case of monstrosity is related by Dr. Friese in Casper's Wochenschrift.$ The child lived only half an hour: in addition to the absence of the external genital organs, there were neither testes, vasa deferentia, nor vesicular seminales. Cases, however, in which the whole of the genital apparatus is deficient or irregularly formed, do not come within the scope of this article. Geotfroy St. Hilaire has recorded a remarkable, and so far as I know, unique case of union of the testicles in the abdomen. || * London Medical Gazette, vol. xxviii. p. 817. f American Journal of the American Sciences, vol. xxiii. p. 352. % London Medical Gazette, vol. xx. p. 717. § Dec. 25. 1841.

Deficiencies and imperfections of the vas deferens. — In Mr. Paget's case of supposed absence of the testicle it is stated, that the vas deferens terminated nearly opposite the external ring in a rounded cul-de-sac; and in Dr. Fisher's case of deficiency of both testicles, that the vasa deferentia, though properly formed and nearly of natural size, terminated in cul-de-sacs at the end of the cord. In the museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, there is a preparation taken from a man fifty years of age, who died of strangulated hernia. A piece of intestine was strictured by a band of adhesion connected with the mesentery, and the testicle was detained in the upper open- ing of the ring. On dissection of the parts, the vas deferens was found to terminate near the testicle in a cul-de-sac. The gland was very small, and its structure appeared granular like the undeveloped testicle of a youth. There was no trace of the epididymis. Mr. Hunter in dissecting a male subject found the vasa deferentia not only deficient near the testicles, but terminating below in a single irregularly formed vesicula seminalis, and having no com- munication with the urethra.* There are a few other cases on record, in which the vas deferens has been defective at the extremity which joins the ejaculatory canal. Thus, Tenon, in the dissection of an infant affected with extraversion of the bladder, found that the vasa deferentia terminated separately at the bottom of the pelvis, in two white tuber- cles : the scrotum, testes, and vesiculae semi- nales were in a natural state, f But besides these imperfections at its two extremities, this duct has been found wanting throughout nearly its whole extent. Brugnoni mentions, that in dissecting the parts of generation in a robust man, from twenty-six to twenty-seven years of age, he found the right epididymis almost entirely absent, the only part remaining being the head, which formed nodules filled with semen. The rest of the epididymis and the vas deferens were wanting, without any mark of disease. The testicle was perfectly sound, and nearly of the same size as the left one. On examining the corresponding vesicula seminalis he found at its anterior extremity a portion of the canal of the vas deferens about an inch in length, and properly formed. The vesicula seminalis itself was flaccid and quite empty ; whilst the left was full of semen. He remarks, that although this vicious conforma- tion was according to all appearances con- genital, nevertheless the vesicula seminalis and ejaculatory canal had preserved their natural cavities. J In a case related by Bosscha, the left vas deferens of a robust man terminated in a blind extremity near the testicle, the rest of the canal being wanting. There was the rudiment of a left vesicula seminalis in the * Works by Palmer, vol iv. p. 23. f Mem sur quelques Vices des Voies Urinaires, &c. n Mem. de l'Acad.

The left testicle was sound.* Mr. Paget has happily explained the origin of these several defects in the vas deferens, by reference to the mode of development of the special organs of generation. He observes+, after Muller and Valentin, that, in the normal course of human development the proper ge- nital organs are in either sex developed in two distinct pieces : namely, the part for the for- mation of the generative substance, the testicle or ovary, and the part for the conveyance of that substance out of the body, the seminal duct or ovi-duct. The testicle or ovary as the case may be, (and in their earliest periods they cannot be distinguished), is formed on the inner concave side of the corpus Wolffianum, and the seminal or ovi-duct, which is originally an isolated tube closed at both extremities, passes along the outer border of that body from the level of the formative organ above to the cloaca or common sinus of the urinary, genital, and digestive systems below. The perfection of development is attained only by the conducting tube acquiring its just connec- tions at once with the formative organ, and, through the medium of the cloaca, with the exterior of the body. The sexual character is first established, when, in the male, the for- mative and conducting organs become con- nected by the development of intermediate tubes which constitute the epididymis ; or when in the female, a simple aperture is formed at the upper extremity of the conducting tube, and is placed closely adjacent to the formative organ. In both sexes alike, the lower ex- tremities of the conducting tubes first open into the common cloaca, and subsequently, when that cavity is partitioned into bladder and rec- tum, or bladder, vagina, and rectum, they ac- quire in each their just connections, and become in the male the perfect vasa deferentia, and in the female the Fallopian tubes and uterus. The inquiry is not without interest, what influence have these deficiencies and imperfec- tions in the vas deferens on the evolution and subsequent condition of the testicle ? In the case of the adult which occurred at St. Bar- tholomew's Hospital, the testicle was small, and its structure appeared granular, like the undeveloped testicle of a youth, but as it had not descended into the scrotum, and was com- bined with hernia, there may have been other causes impeding its due evolution. In Mr. Hunter's case, the testicles which were in the scrotum were very sound. In the case of the man related by Brugnone, the testicle on the side corresponding to the defective vas de- ferens was perfectly sound, and nearly of the same size as the other. So also in Bosscha's case, it is stated, that the testicle was sound. Although either of these defects in the vas deferens renders the gland an useless organ, * Diss, sistens Obs. de vesieulaj seminalis sinis- tra defectu, integris testibus, vase vero deferente clauso, quoted by Dr. Vrolik, Handboek der Ontleed- kundige Ziektekunde, 1st Deel. p. 210. f Loe. cit. p. 818. and if it occurred on both sides of the body, would necessarily cause impotency, these cases, nevertheless, tend to shew that the absence or imperfection of the excretory duct does not prevent the development of the tes- ticle at the proper period, and has no direct influence in causing it to waste; and these inferences are fully confirmed by experiments on animals, performed by Sir A. Cooper and by myself.* These cases and experiments show, then, that the testicles maybe properly developed, though a physical obstacle to the elimination of their secretion is present from birth ; and that so long as the testicles exist entire, though to no purpose, the individual acquires and preserves all the marks of the male sex ; the secretory organ alone appear- ing to be that upon which the sexual charac- ters depend. The engorgement of the se- minal ducts with sperm is liable, it is true, to cause inflammation of the testicle, which may end in atrophy, but this is only a secondary and occasional effect of the interruption in the excretory duct. Imperfect transition. — It occasionally hap- pens that at birth one or both testicles have not passed into the scrotum, being detained either in the abdomen near the groin, in the inguinal canal, or in the groin, just outside the external ring. In a table of one hundred and three male infants, examined by Wrisbergat the time of birth, it appears that seventy-three had both testicles in the scrotum ; in twenty-one, one or both were in the groin. Of these, five had both, seven the right, and nine the left in the groin ; in twelve, four had both, three the right, five the left, only in the abdomen.f According to this table, the imperfection occurs rather more frequently on the left side than on the right, in the proportion of seven to five. In twenty-five cases examined at different ages, varying from five to sixty, — sixteen of which came under my own observation, the remainder being taken from the recorded experience of others, — in thirteen the imperfection was on the right side, and in twelve on the left. Dr. Marshall states, that in the examination of 10,800 recruits, he had found five in whom the right, and six in whom the left testicle was not apparent. In two of these cases there was inguinal hernia on the side where the tes- ticle had not descended. J He met with but one instance in which both testicles had not appeared. $ The testicle sometimes remains permanently fixed in the situation in which it is placed at birth || ; but in some instances the passage, though delayed, is completed at some period previous to puberty, and often within a few weeks after birth. Mr. Hunter was of opinion that this completion most frequently * Vide Sir A. Cooper on Anatomy of the Testis, p. 51., and my Treatise on the Diseases of the Testis, p. 64, and seq. f Commentatio Soc. Reg. Scient.

For the causes which operate at this late period tend as much to promote the formation of hernia as the transition of the testicle. In cases where the testicle makes no appearance before puberty, uneasiness is often experienced at that period, owing to the enlargement of the gland being restrained by the rings and parts composing the inguinal canal. At the same time also, it is often protruded outside the external ring by the movements of the abdomen in respiration. The causes of a failure in the transition of the testicle have not been much investigated, and as considerable doubt has long prevailed respecting the mode and agency by which this change is effected, no satisfactory explana- tion could be expected of the circumstances interrupting or preventing it. When we re- flect on the nature of that process, as my researches have led me to describe it, it is clear, that there must not only be a perfect adaptation of parts, a due relation between the body displaced and the structures which it traverses, but also corresponding power in the agent by which it is accomplished. There are few muscles in the human body whose development in different individuals varies in a greater degree than that of the cremaster. And if such be the case after birth, it is not unreasonable to presume that similar differ- ences exist in the foetus before the gland changes its position, and that a failure in the process may be the result of deficient power in the muscu/us testis to accomplish the pas- sage. It is not improbable that this muscle is sometimes paralysed, and that the faulty transition is owing to a want of a due supply of the nervous energy, which we know is often denied to other muscles during foetal exist- ence, and is the cause of deformities in the feet and otherparts, with which infantsare often ushered into the -world. I think, indeed, we may fairly enumerate paralysis and defective development of the cremaster amongst the presumed causes of the imperfect transition of the testicle. Peritonitis occasionally at- tacks the foetus in uteroj, and produces ad- hesions between the various abdominal viscera. It is well known that in congenital hernia the testicle is frequently united to a portion of * Lib. cit. p. 15. t Lib. cit. p. 203. % Vide Contributions to Infra-uterine Pathology, by Dr. Simpson, Ldinb. Med. and Surg. Journal, nos. cxxxvii. and cxl. intestine or omentum, and that the formation of these adhesions previous to the transition of the testicle is sometimes the cause of the displacement, the viscera being drawn, together with the gland, into the scrotum. Many facts seem to show that similar adhesions are, on the other hand, an occasional cause of the temporary and permanent retention of the testicle, the cremaster being insufficient to overcome this obstacle to its passage. In the examination of a man, age sixty, I found the right testicle just external to the abdominal ring ; it was small in size, and closely adherent to a portion of omentum. A young man was under my care for many months, on account of an imperfect transition of the testicle on the left side. The gland moved backwards and forwards through the external abdominal ring. By pressure above, it could be forced down sufficiently to admit of being examined. This testicle was much smaller than the right, which was in the scrotum, and I could distinctly make out a portion of intestine closely adherent, which accompanied the organ in all its movements. It is probable that the smallness of the opening in the internal abdominal ring is sometimes a cause of the detention of the testicle, especially in those cases in which the organ is retained within the inguinal canal. Mr. Wilson, an accurate anatomist, was of this opinion*, which is supported by the fact, that the testicle is oftener found in the groin than in the cavity of the abdomen. M. Dela- siauve mentions a case, in which, he states, the organ was retained by the border of the outer column of the ring.f Mr. Hunter was inclined to suspect that the fault originates in the testicles themselves. It is difficult to un- derstand how this can be, for as the gland is passive in this process, it can offer no obstacle, unless it grows too large to pass the opening in the abdominal parietes ; whereas, it is ad- mitted that the gland when retained is usually below the natural size. Nor does it appear, that the interruption is owing to any want of proper length in the vas deferens, for in a case of imperfect transition in a boy, whose body I examined, I particularly noticed that this duct was so long as to be doubled on itself, and tortuous, a circumstance which has been remarked in other cases by Mr. MayoJ, Rosen- merhel$, and others. It may be concluded then, that the causes of a failure in the pas- sage of the testicle are various ; that this imperfection may result from want of power, or paralysis of the cremaster muscle; from adhesions retaining the gland within the ab- domen ; and from a contracted state of the opening of the external abdominal ring. Mr. Hunter states, that when one or both testicles remain through life in the belly, he believes that they are exceedingly imperfect, * Lectures on the Urinary and Genital Organs, p. 405. f Revue Me'dicale, Mars, 1840, p. 363. i Human Physiology, 3d edit. p. 411. § Ueber die Radicalcur des in der Weiche liegen- den Testikels.990 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). and probably incapable of performing their natural functions ; and that this imperfection prevents the disposition for descent taking place. That they are more defective even than those which are late in passing to the scrotum, he infers from the circumstance, that in quadrupeds, the testicle that has reached the scrotum is considerably larger than the one which remains in the abdomen. Mr. Hunter had seen only one case in the human subject where both testicles continued in the abdomen, but this proved an exception to the above observation, since we are led to con- clude that they were perfectly formed, as the person had all the powers and passions of a man.* Professor Owen in commenting upon these observations, states, " It seems remark- able that with this experience Mr. Hunter should have formed from inconclusive analogy, and promulgated, an opinion tending to occa- sion so much unhappiness as that which attri- butes exceeding imperfection and probable incapacity of performing their natural func- tions to testes which in the human subject are retained within the abdomen. That there is nothing in such a situation which neces- sarily tends to impair their efficiency is evident, from the number of animals in which they constantly form part of the abdominal vis- cera ; and in those in which the testes na- turally pass into a scrotum, their continuance in the abdomen, ^according to our author's own observation, is accompanied only with a difference of size or shape; now we may readily suppose that this may influence the quantity, but not necessarily the quality, of the secretion." There are very few accounts * on record of the dissection of undescended testicles. In a case, in which M. Cloquet found the left testicle situated within the abdomen, the gland was well formed, and of the same size as the right, which had de- scended into the scrotum. The parts taken from an apprentice of Sir A. Cooper, who unfortunately committed suicide in conse- quence of the infirmity, are preserved in the Museum of Guy's Hospital. I have ex- amined the preparation ; and the testicles, which are both within the abdomen, close to the internal ring, appear to be nearly, if not quite, the natural size, and it is stated that the ducts contained semen. In a lad, aged nineteen, whose left testicle was found, by Dr. Bright, within the abdomen, near the brim of the pelvis, the gland was considerably smaller than natural, but the ducts and se- creting structure were quite perfect.")" These are the only cases of testicles situated within the abdomen in which we have any account of the anatomical condition of the gland. In addition to the evidence they afford of the ca- pability of testicles thus placed to exercise their functions, may be adduced the case of Mr. Hunter, just alluded to, in which a person, both of whose testicles continued in the ab- domen, had all the powers and passions of * Works by Palmer, vol. iv. p. 18. f Hospital Reports, vol. ii. p. 258. a man ; and a case recorded by Mr. Poland, of a man so formed, who was aged twenty- nine. He had all the signs of virility, had married twice, and was the father of two children.* On the other hand, Mr. Wilson mentions the case of a young man, twenty-five years of age, whose testicles never descended. He had some beard, and not an unmanly ap- pearance ; but although an imprudent, and in some things a dissipated person, he had never shown the least desire for women, or disposition for sexual intercourse.")" John West, a lad, aged sixteen, died in the London Hospital, in a state of universal anasarca. There was no appearance of beard, and only a few hairs were scattered over the pubes. My attention was particularly directed to the state of the genital organs, by observing that the scrotum, which was greatly distended with serous effusion, was not fully developed on the right side. I found the right testicle within the abdomen, about an inch and a half above the internal ring. It was very small, not larger than that of a child two years of age; and on cutting into it, the gland pre- sented the granular appearance usually re- marked at that early period. Passage of the Testicle into the Perineum. — Mr. Hunter first observed that the testicle in changing its situation does not always pre- serve a proper course towards the scrotum, there being instances of its taking another direction and passing into the perineum. How this is brought about, he remarks, it is difficult to say: it may possibly be occasioned by something unusual in the construction of the scrotum, or more probably, by a peculiarity in that of the perineum itself. For it is not easy to imagine how the testicle could make its way to the parts about the perineum, if these were in a perfectly natural state. He met with two instances of this imperfection. Many years ago a little boy, one of whose testicles had thus deviated from its proper- course was brought to the London Hospital. The gland was lodged in the perineum at the root of the scrotum. M. Ricord met with this singular anomaly in two instances. M. Vidal (de Cassis) observed it in two brothers : their father was exempt from it. The testicle abnormally placed was smaller than the other.\ The irregularity is exceedingly rare, and the above cases are all with which I am acquainted. Passage of the Testicle through the Crural Ring. — M. Vidal relates the case of a man, one of whose testicles, instead of passing out of the abdomen at the inguinal canal, made its exit at the crural ring. The organ was mounted upon the abdomen like a crural hernia. A portion of intestine traversed the inguinal canal, forming a rupture on that side. § I know of only one other instance of this * Guy's Hospital Eeports.

In this case, the testicle passed out at first through the inguinal canal, but having been returned by the patient into the abdomen, it subsequently escaped at the femoral ring.* Inversion of the Testicle.— It sometimes happens that the position of the testicle in the scrotum is reversed, so that the free sur- face presents posteriorly, and the epididymis is attached to the anterior part of the gland, instead of to the posterior. The first case that I met with was that of a man who had a swelling of the right testicle, which puzzled his medical attendant. On examination 1 found this to be the epididymis thickened from chronic inflammation. I was able clearly to trace the vas deferens proceeding to it along the front of the scrotum. The body of the testicle was unaffected, and its posterior edge was quite smooth and regular. The disposition of the left testicle was normal. On visiting the Hopital de Midi in Paris, in April, 1849, M. Ricord showed me a case of epididymitis on the left side, in which the gland was thus inverted. He informed me that he had often met with this arrangement. I have since had two patients under my care, one of whose tes- ticles was thus inverted. One was a lad in the London Hospital affected with epididymitis. The other was a gentleman who consulted me for chronic orchitis confined to the body of the testicle. The epididymis being unaffected, the inversion was less perceptible than in the three preceding cases. M. Maissonneuve, in a thesis published in Paris in 1835, I believe first called attention to this irregular disposition, which he states that he had met with many times upon the dead body, and upon the living, and he mentions what I remarked myself in the four cases just noticed, that the inversion was confined to one side. Surgeons should bear in mind the liability tojthis dis- position of the gland in making their diagnosis of the diseases affecting it. Atrophy of the Testicle. — The testicles, like other organs formed for the exercise of tem- porary functions, do not arrive at a perfect state of development until a certain period of life, after which their activity ceases, and they become gradually and imperceptibly diminished. Thus we find that in early life they are small in proportion to the size of the body as compared with their condition at puberty, and that as old age advances and the generative functions cease to be called into action, they undergo a diminution in size, their vessels grow less, the seminiferous tubes become small and contracted, and partially ob- literated. In the lower animals these changes are far more remarkable than in man, for as the functions of the testicle are exerted only at stated periods of the year, as the rutting or copulating season advances these organs rapidly increase in bulk, and in its decline undergo a proportionate degree of wasting. In man, it sometimes happens that the tes- * Loder's Journal fur die Chirurg. ii. Bd. 1 Stff. s. 187. tides do not acquire their proper size at the usual period, their development being from some cause or other arrested ; and also, after the organs have arrived at their full and perfect growth, that occasionally one or both suffer a premature decay. Under the head then of Atrophy of the Testicle I shall consider: 1. Arrest of Development; and 2. Wasting. Arrest of Development. — If the congenital lesions to which the testicle is liable had not been previously treated of, the cases of ab- sence of the organ already described, might be correctly referred to the present head, as the deficiency in these cases was no doubt the result of an arrest in the early development of the organ. But the cases that I am now about to consider are those in which the sub- sequent evolution which the testicles undergo at puberty is delayed beyond the usual period, or never takes place at all. Mr. Wilson relates a curious instance of his having been consulted by a gentleman, twenty-six years of age, on the propriety of entering the marriage state, whose penis and testicles very little ex- ceeded in size those of a boy of eight years of age. He had never felt the desire for sexual intercourse until he became acquainted with his intended wife; since that period he had experienced repeated erections, attended with nocturnal emissions. He married, be- came the father of a family ; and these parts, which at six and twenty years of age were so much smaller than usual, at twenty-eight had increased nearly to the usual size of those of an adult man.* Mr. Wilson mentions this singular case, as it will admit of questions whether the parts alluded to became properly formed as to size, and possessed of the power of secretion, in consequence of being, although so late in life, influenced by the passions excited by attachment to a particular female ; or whether the enlargement and proper action of the parts beginning, occasioned such passion first to exist. He thinks the probability in favour of the former supposition, in which opinion I certainly concur. Lallemand men- tions having seen a man about thirty years of age, extremely fat, and without a beard or hair on the pubes, whose penis and testicle ap- peared to belong to a child of from seven to eight years: he had never experienced erec- tions or venereal desires.f A young man died in the London Hospital of disease of the heart. He was seventeen years and nine months old : the body measured five feet five inches in height, and was plump and well formed. There was no appearance of beard, or whiskers, or of hair on the pubes. The penis and testicles were very small, not larger than they are usually found in boys of three or four years of age. The testicles were about equal in size, and one of them weighed only two scruples and one grain. Both organs were normal in structure, appearing like the glands in early life, when the tubular structure * Lectures on the Urinary and Genital Organs, p. 424. t Des Pertes Se'minales Involontaires, t. ii. p. 380.992 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). is very indistinctly developed. No sperma- tozoa could be detected. These were clearly instances of arrest of development of the tes- ticles. As these organs are chiefly excited to action by an operation of the mind, it is easy to understand that they may sometimes re- main undeveloped owing to defective organi- sation of the brain, an absence of sexual desires being invariably remarked in these cases. Cases of wasting of the testicles after injuries of the head, and the frequent absence of the venereal appetite in cretins and idiots, tend to strengthen this opinion. The follow- ing are marked examples of defective develop- ment of the sexual organs, accompanied with imperfection of the brain. An idiot, aged nineteen, subject to epileptic fits, died of typhus fever in the Hackney union. The youth was of short stature, and the form of the body was not indicative of either sex, but the contour was rounded as in the female. There was no appearance of hair about the face or pubes. The abdomen and other parts were covered with a thick layer of fat. The penis and scrotum were remarkably small, not larger than they are usually found in a child two or three years of age. Both testicles were in the scrotum, but they were of very diminutive size ; the right weighed less than a drachm, and the left not more than twenty three grains. The right gland had descended a very little way below the abdominal ring. The glandular structure and epididymis of both testicles were indistinct, and the vasa Sdeferentia also extremely small. Nothing re- markable was observed in the structure of the brain. Mr. Hovell, the surgeon of the union, also showed me another inmate of the same workhouse, a lad aged nineteen, and of weak mind, whose penis and testicles did not exceed in size those of a boy seven or eight years of age, and who had only a few scattered hairs on the pubes. In the museum at Fort Pitt, Chatham, are preserved two undeveloped testicles about the size of those of a child six months old, but healthy in structure, which were taken from a lunatic 58 years of age. His penis was small and he had never experienced any inclination for sexual inter- course. Wasting. — In investigating the alterations in the nutritive condition of the testicle, it is very desirable to fix, if possible, some standard by which they may be estimated. The size of the gland is neither uniform nor conveniently appreciated. Its weight, likewise, varies so much in different persons and in the same in- dividual at different periods, according as it has lately exercised its functions or remained inactive, and as it is full of semen or empty, that it is scarcely possible to determine on any accurate standard of this kind. (See p. 976.) I should consider the testicle of an adult weighing less than three drachms as in a state of atrophy. A testicle in an advaced state of wasting, not arising from disease of the gland, usually preserves its shape, but feels soft, having lost its elasticity and firm- ness. Its texture is pale and exhibits few blood-vessels, the tubuli and septa dividing the lobes are indistinct, and the former cannot be so readily drawn out into shreds as before. The epididymis does not usually waste so soon nor in the same degree as the body of the testicle. It sometimes however, loses its characteristic appearance, and I have even found it reduced to a few fibrous threads. The fluid pressed out of the wasted testicle and epididymis is entirely destitute of sper- matic granules and spermatozoa. In many- instances adipose tissue is deposited behind the tunica vaginalis, and encroaches on the epididymis and posterior part of the testicle. Fatty matter is also found in the glandular sub- stance of atrophied testicles, as in one taken from a man aged forty-six, who died of dropy consequent on disease of the kidneys, which was wasted to one fifth its natural size. In ad- dition to the presence of adipose tissue be- neath the visceral portion of the tunica vagin- alis, I recognised a quantity of yellow matter irregularly disposed amongst the wasted tu- buli. This matter on examination in the mi- croscope, proved to be oil globules, and readily dissolved on the application of ether. The structures composing the spermatic cord un- dergo a corresponding diminution ; the cre- master muscle disappears, the nerves shrink, and the vessels are reduced in size and num- ber. The vas deferens, though small, can ge- nerally be injected with mercury as far as the commencement of the epididymis. A testicle, atrophied from disease, is not only of dimin- ished size and weight, but is altered in shape, being uneven and irregular, and sometimes of an elongated form. The surfaces of the tunica vaginalis are adherent and its cavity is partly or entirely obliterated. There is no, or very little, trace of the proper glandular structure, the organ being converted into fibrous tissue of a firm texture. It loses its peculiar sensi- bility to pressure, but is sometimes the seat of morbid sensibility. All those causes which produce decay in other parts likewise occasion wasting of the testicle. Thus an impeded circulation, pressure, want of exercise, and loss of nervous influence, have been noticed as causes of atrophy of this gland. To these must be added certain causes which specially affect the testicle. The following case, related by Mr. Wardrop, is a good example of atrophy from defective nutrition. A person, both of whose testicles were completely absorbed, nothing being felt in the scrotum but a loose vaginal coat, died of an aneurism of the aorta, formed at the origin of the spermatic arteries, both of which were obliterated.* A ligature on the spermatic artery is sufficient to cause a total decay of the testicle, which induced the celebrated Harvey f to propose its ap- * Note to his edition of Baillie's works, vol. ii. p. 315. t Anatomical Exercitations concerning the Generation of Living Creatures.

J. Maunoir, of Geneva. The influ- ence of pressure in causing partial atrophy of the testicle, is somtimes remarked in old cases of hydrocele and hcematocele, in which the gland has been long subjected to com- pression from the retained fluid. It has been said that the testicles waste in those persons who strictly adhere to their monastic vows, but I am not aware that there is sufficient authority for this remark. In persons who marry, after many years of ab- stinence from sexual intercourse, the testicles undergo a certain degree of enlargement. It is a great error to suppose that sexual connec- tion in early life is essential for the preservation of these organs. In cases of enlargement of the prostate the ejaculatory canals sometimes become completely obstructed. Under these circumstances, the semen secreted under ex- citement having no means of escape, encum- bers the testicles for a time, but afterwards becomes absorbed, and it is said that atrophy of these glands sometimes follows; but I have never observed any instance of wasting of the organs from this cause. As examples of atrophy of the testicles from loss of nervous in- fluence, may be adduced cases of paraplegia, in which these organs have been known to waste. Portal mentions the case of a robust man, aged thirty-five, who was attacked with painter's colic, attended with great debility of the lower extremities. The testicles dimin- ished considerably ; and although he after- wards recovered from the paralysis of his limbs, these glands always remained wasted ; and the man was incapable of the act of gene- ration.* In the xxth volume of the "Medical and Physical Journal," there is an account of a case of recovery after fracture, with partial dislocation of the first and second lumbar vertebra;, followed by paraplegia, in which, three years afterwards, the testicles were found entirely obliterated. It has been stated that the testicles sometimes waste from in- juries, or from compression of the spine at the origin of the spermatic nerves. In a man who had received a blow on the lum- bar region, the testicles gradually wasted away. 7 The most common cause of atrophy of the the testicle is the disturbance in its organisa- tion consequent upon inflammation. As the inflammatory process ceases, the enlarged gland not only becomes reduced to its original size, but' it sometimes slowly but steadily diminishes, till at length very little vestige of it remains Mr. Hunter has related three cases in which the testicle decayed in this way.J 1 have met with several instances of atrophy arising from this cause, and there are few surgeons of experience who have not witnessed cases of the kind. Wasting of the * Cours d'Anatomie Medicale, t. v. p. 434. f Baillie's Works, by Wardrop, vol ii. p. 315. f Treatise on the Venereal Disease. VOL. IV. testicle has been observed to occur after an attack of orchitis in mumps, arising as it is supposed from the translation of inflamma- tion from the parotid to the testicle. Two cases of cynanche parotidea in the adult, in which atrophy took place in the gland chiefly affected, are related by Dr. R. Hamilton.* I have witnessed one case, in which the patient attributed the loss of the gland to an attack of mumps in his infancy. Wasting is more liable to occur after inflammation of the body of the gland than after consecutive inflamma- tion in which the epididymis is the part chiefly affected. One or both testicles have been found to waste in persons who have indulged too much in sexual intercourse or been addicted to onanism. Baron Larrey met with several cases of atrophy from excessive venery and abuse of strong drinks amongst the soldiers of the Imperial Guard.f Sir B. Broclie has recorded two cases in which wasting was occasioned by over-excitement; in one from onanism, in the other from sexual intercourse.J I have also witnessed an instance of total atrophy of the left testicle in a person addicted to excessive masturbation. In this case, and probably in the others just quoted, the wasting was preceded by an attack of inflammation induced by inordinate excitement. It is a common belief that wasting of the testicle is liable to be induced by the long- continued use of iodine. I have not met with any instance of it, and there are few cases in which the evidence is such as to render it at all clear that the decay of the gland was really occasioned by the remedy. M. Cullerier has published the case of a young man who took from twenty-five to thirty drops of the tinc- ture of iodine for a period of three months for the cure of an obstinate gonorrhaea. This was followed by a state of impotency and partial wasting of the testicles, which lasted a twelvemonth, and the organs never regained their former size and vigour. M. Cullerier mentions another case of temporary loss of virile power occurring from the use of the iodine of iron.$ I feel convinced, however, that if iodine produces wasting of the testicle at all, it does so so rarely, that the liability cannot be regarded as any objection to the free and long-continued use of this valuable remedy. Atrophy of the testicle has been remarked in elephantiasis of the Greeks, a disease in which tubercles are developed in various parts of the skin. Dr. Adams, in an account of the cases of that disease observed in Maderia, states that all those who were attacked with it before the age of puberty never acquired the distinguishing marks of that change in the constitution, and their testicles diminished in size, and that in those affected later in life the testicles became * Philos.

Wasting of the testicles is liable to occur after injuries of the head. Some years ago I saw a man who had met with an injury of this description, which had been followed by wasting of the testicles, and the development of tumours on each side of the chest, resembling mammas. He was about fifty-nine years of age, a married man, and the father of several children. He had belonged to the legion in the Queen of Spain's service. About two years and a half previously, in an at- tempt to jump over a trench, he fell backwards and injured the posterior part of his head. Whilst on the ground he received a bayonet wound on the side, and a sabre cut on the fore- head. He recovered from these injuries and returned to England. Since the accident he had completely lost his virility. He had no desire for sexual connection ; his penis had dwindled in size ; his right testicle had gradu- ally wasted, and was no larger than a horse bean, and the left gland was also a good deal diminished in bulk. The skull at the occiput seemed somewhat flattened. Baron Larrey records the case of a man who was wounded in the back of the neck by a musket ball which grazed the inferior occipital protuber- ance. He recovered from the injury, but the testicles were reduced to a state of atrophy, and the penis shrunk and remained inactive. He also relates the case of a man of strong constitution and vigorous passions who re- ceived a sabre wound which cut off all the convex projecting part of the occipital bone, and exposed the dura mater. The patient lost the senses of sight and hearing on the right side, and his testicles sensibly diminished, and in fifteen days were reduced, especially the left, to the size of a bean.|| Lallemand had under his care a man thirty years of age, who, in the expedition to Algiers had received a sabre wound at the nape of the neck. His testicles were wasted, and venereal desire as well as erections had entirely ceased.f We cannot doubt that in these cases the loss of sexual desire, and the wasting of the testicles were the direct results of the injury to the brain, and they go far to prove the essential dependence of the functions of these glands * On Morbid Poisons, p. 2C5. j- Edinb.

The physiologist cannot fail to notice the rapidity with which the atrophy is stated in some of the cases to have succeeded the injury and the extent to which it proceeded. The withering of the testicles, was, indeed, so remarkable, that it can only be attributed to the sudden and complete extinction of the sexual instinct resident in the brain, and (if I may so express myself) to the immediate impression on the system of the future uselessness of these organs. In old age and in lingering diseases the decay of the testicles is extremely slow and gradual, and is never carried to the extent observed in cases of injury to the brain. In fact, men have survived the power or desire of performing the sexual act many years without the testicles being materially reduced in size. We have seen, too, that in the lower animals the testicles have been rendered use- less by interrupting the vasa deferentia, with- out any such striking effect being produced on the glands as occurred in these cases of cerebral injury. Inflammation of the tunica vaginalis, or acute hydrocele. — The inflammatory changes of the tunica vaginalis resemble those of the other serous membranes. M. Roux injected a hydrocele in a middle-aged man : inflamma- tion was developed, but on the fourth day, gangrenous erysipelas attacked the scrotum, and caused the patient's death on the tenth day after the operation. On examining the tunica vaginalis, he found that it contained a large quantity of whitish serum, in the midst of which floated flakes of albumen ; other flakes of the same kind formed a thick coating over the testicle and internal surface of the membranous pouch. The serous membrane beneath appeared slightly thickened, and of a deep red colour. The epididymis and the lower part of the cord were swollen, and con- stituted the more solid part of the tumour produced by the inflammation. The body of the testicle was not increased in bulk, and it retained its natural consistence.* In the mu- seum of the College of Surgeons, there is a beautifully injected preparation of hydrocele, showing the effects of inflammation after the application of the caustic. It is represented in the annexed wood-cut, which exhibits the sac with part of it cut away to show the swollen state of the epididymis, and the aperture made by the caustic (1) ; the tunica vaginalis is coated with flocculi of lymph. The sac of an inguinal hernia is seen above the hydrocele. The sound state of the body of the testicle, though surrounded by an in- flamed serous tunic, whilst the epididymis partakes in the disease, has been accounted for by Gendrin. He says, when the sub- serous cellular tissue, which always partici- pates in the inflammation of a serous mem- brane penetrates into the interior of an organ, it becomes a ready means of communicating * Journal General de Medicine, &c. t. lviii. p. 25.; quoted from Gendrin, Histoire Anatomique des In- flammations, t. i. p. 143.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 995 3 s 2 the inflammatory action ; but when the con- tiguous organ or subjacent part is of a dif- Fig. 638. ferent structure from that of the cellular tissue, the extension of inflammation inwards is checked. Thus, in the case of the inflamed tunica vaginalis, the cellular tissue readily transmitted the morbid action to the epididy- mis, but the tunica albuginea arrested its progress to the body of the testicle ; and this explains the fact that after inflammation of the tunica vaginalis, excited by injection, the body of the gland is rarely found to suffer. On the other hand, the epididymis is seldom attacked with inflammation without the disease being quickly propagated to the tunica vagi- nalis. The lymph effused in inflammation very often forms adhesions between the opposed serous surfaces, and these after some time are rendered very firm and dense, and in old cases are often converted into a fibro-cartilaginous structure. In a testicle which I examined some little while after an "attack of acute in- flammation, I found the lymph on both sur- faces of the tunica vaginalis presenting a honeycomb or lace-like appearance, similar to that often met with on the pericardium. In- flammation, if violent, may end in the forma- tion of pus ; suppuration is, however, a rare occurrence, unless artificially excited, for the cure of hydrocele. Inflammation of the tunica vaginalis is not only the most frequent disease of the testicle, but it is also one of the most common affections to which the body is liable. In the different disorders of the gland this membrane usually becomes inflamed at some period or other, and adhesions between its opposed surfaces are scarcely less common than those of the pleura. In examining the testicles of twenty-four adults, I found ad- hesions of greater or less extent in one or both glands in as many as nine instances. Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, — The sac of the tunica vaginalis, like other serous ca- vities, is liable to dropsical effusion. The fluid effused is usually transparent, and of an amber, pale yellow, citron, or straw co- lour, and resembles the serum of the blood, but is occasionally thick. According to Dr. Marcet's analysis*", 1000 grains of this fluid of the specific gravity 1024'3 contained 80 grains of solid matter, of which 71'5 con- sisted of animal, and 8*5 of saline ingredients : hence it appears that this fluid only differs from the serum of the blood in possessing rather less animal matter. In an analysis of the fluid of hydrocele made by Dr. Bos- tockf, 100*00 parts of the specific gravity 102i were found to contain Water - - - 91'25 Albumen - 6*85 Uncoagulable matter - l'l Salts ... -8 100-00 A quantity of flakey matter or flocculent albumen is sometimes found floating in the fluid ; and it frequently contains, especially in old people, cholesterine in the form of a multitude of minute shining particles. The quantity of cholesterine contained in nine- teen ounces of dark fluid full of these shining particles, which I removed from an old hy- drocele, amounted to nine grains. In the examination of a testicle from a man of co- lour who died at an advanced age, I found the tunica vaginalis and its investing tissues very thick and firm, and the seat of cartilaginous and osseous deposits ; it contained about three drachms of a thick brownish substance, which was almost entirely composed of cholesterine. This was no doubt a very old case of hydro- cele, in which, the more fluid parts having been absorbed, the cholesterine was left be- hind within the indurated sac. The quantity of serum which is suffered to accumulate varies considerably. In this country it seldom exceeds twenty ounces, though it has been known to amount to several pints. The largest quantity which I have met with is forty-eight ounces. Mr. Cline is said to have removed from Gibbon the historian as much as six quarts.\ la simple hydrocele the testicle is usually found at the posterior part, and rather below the centre, of the sac : its situation however is subject to variations. Before the occur- * Medico-Chirurg. Trans, vol. ii. p. 372. t Ibid. vol. iv. p. 72. | Sir A. Cooper's Lectures, by Tyrrell, vol. ii. p. 92.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 996 rence of hydrocele the tunica vaginalis may have been inflamed and contracted adhesions, so that the testicle may be connected to the membrane in front; in which case the serum accumulates on each side of or above and below the organ. The position of the testicle in front may also be owing to an original inversion of the organ, in which the free sur- face presenting backwards, the fluid collects in that direction and presses the testicle to the front of the sac. Sometimes there are several adhesions producing a sacculated ar- rangement and forming what is termed a multilocular hydrocele. Occasionally the cysts thus formed have no communication with each other. In two instances I have seen a membranous partition in the sac of a hydro- cele, separating it into two distinct cavities, formed by a layer of false membrane. There is one kind of sac or pouch often met with in hydroceles which is not commonly de- scribed. It is situated on the inner side of the testicle, but the opening into it is always found on the outer side between the body of the gland and the middle of the epididymis. This sac, which varies very much in size, is formed by the distention of the cul-de-sac which I have described as existing naturally at this part. Two examples of this kind of pouch are contained in the Hunterian Mu- seum. One of them is represented in the accompanying figure. In large hydroceles Fig. 639. 1, aperture of the pouch between the body of the testicle and middle of the epididymis. the epididymis is usually elongated and dis- placed ; and instead of a pouch being formed, the central part of the epididymis is drawn to some distance from the body of the tes- ticle. In old hydroceles the sac is often a good deal thickened, the tissues enveloping it being condensed and converted into layers of dense fascia, such as are commonly observed investing only hernial sacs. The fibres, also, of the cremaster muscle, frequently become remarkably developed. This, however, is not constantly the case ; for in some instances of hydrocele of large size I have found this muscle atrophied. The thickened sac after many years acquires a cartilaginous cha- racter, and it sometimes even becomes os- sified. In cases which have been frequently tapped, the sac is often found closely ad- herent to the skin of the scrotum at the various points perforated by the trocar. In the Hunterian Museum there is a prepar- ation showing a long narrow band of ad- hesion passing from the anterior part of the testicle across the dilated sac of the tunica vaginalis to the membrane in front, which is supposed to have resulted from a wound of the testicle in the operation of tap- ping. In all large hydroceles the spermatic vessels are separated and displaced. The glandular structure of the testicle is sound, and the organ capable of exercising its func- tions. The disease is strictly confined to the investing serous tunic. The testicle is, how- ever, frequently somewhat altered in shape, being flattened by the pressure of the confined fluid ; and in some instances has been found partially atrophied. Hydrocele is generally single, but some- times occurs on both sides. It is commonly said to form more frequently on the left side than on the right. During the last few years I have registered the new cases of hydrocele coming under my notice in public and private practice. Of one hundred and ten cases of simple hydrocele, one hundred and four were single, and six double. Of the former sixty- two occurred on the right side, and forty-two on the left. This result, which gives a decided predominance to the right side, does not agree with the observations of Velpeau, Gerdy, and Dujat, who found the disease to be more frequent on the left side. Hydrocele in young infants is usually single, and in my experience, more common on the right side. I have seen, however, a few cases of double hydrocele at this early period. When the fluid collected in the tunica vaginalis is attended with en- largement of the testicle, the swelling is termed a hydro-sarcocele. This affection is generally consequent on chronic orchitis, but it is occa- sioned by other morbid changes, malignant as well as innocent. In these cases the disease of the testicle is the original complaint and source of the irritation that excites an undue secretion from the tunica vaginalis. Congenital hydrocele. — In simple hydrocele, the original communication between the ca- vities of the peritoneum and of the tunica vaginalis is permanently obliterated; but it sometimes happens that fluid accumulates around the testicle in cases in which the obliteration has not been completed, consti- tuting the variety termed congenital hydrocele. The opening of communication between the two cavities is usually small in size, about sufficient to admit a crow's or goose's quill. There is rather a rare variety of congenital997 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). hydrocele, in which the testicle is retained in the abdomen or inguinal canal, while the peritoneum, prolonged for a short distance into the scrotum, forms the cyst containing the fluid which is covered only by the inte- guments and superficial fascia. Encysted hydrocele of the testicle.— In this form of hydrocele, fluid is effused into an ad- ventitious cyst or cysts distinct from the sac of the tunica vaginalis. The cyst is composed of a thin delicate serous membrane, and may be developed in three situations: I, beneath the visceral portion of the tunica vaginalis in- vesting the epididymis ; 2. between the testi- cular portion of the tunica vaginalis and the tunica albuginea, which are thus separated from each other ; 3. between the layers of the loose or reflected portion of the tunica vaginalis. The first is by far the most com- mon situation, the two latter being very rare. These Cj'sts are composed of a delicate serous membrane lined with tesselated epithelium, and the fluid contained in them differs from that of simple hydrocele in being perfectly limpid and colourless, and nearly free from albumen. In the cysts formed on the epi- didymis, the fluid, instead of being limpid, often presents an opaline opacity arising from the presence of spermatozoa. 1. Small cysts not larger than a pea, and even smaller, may frequently be found beneath the serous membrane covering the head of the epididymis, in which they produce a slight depression. In several instances I have seen as many as five and six perfectly distinct cysts connected with this part. Sometimes one or two small cysts are so embedded in the substance of the epididymis, that they cannot be recognised without dis- section. Though these minute cysts generally contain a limpid fluid, I have sometimes found them filled with fluid of a milky hue, and I have even observed matter like pus tinged with blood. These accidental cysts some- times project the tunica vaginalis before them until they become so far separated from the epididymis, where they were originally deve- loped, as to be attached only by a narrow peduncle formed by a contraction of the con- necting tunica vaginalis. Such is the mode of development of those small pendulous pe- dunculated cysts containing a limpid fluid often found hanging from the head of the epi- didymis, which were erroneously supposed by Morgagni to be hydatids. I have on many occasions observed them in the different stages of their production. Thus I have seen a pedunculated cyst attached at one part, whilst close to it there was a cyst of a similar nature embedded in the substance of the epididymis. In other instances I have found the cyst very prominent, but still con- nected by a broad attachment to the tunica vaginalis reflected over it, the membrane not having as yet contracted to form the narrow neck. In all these cases the prolongation of the tunica vaginalis investing the cyst could always be demonstrated by cautious dissec- tion, and between the membrane and the cyst some minute red bloodvessels were generally seen ramifying. These pednuculated cysts never acquire a large size : I have seldom found them to exceed that of a currant. From the exposed situation of the testicle they are liable to be ruptured, the vestiges of them consisting of fimbriated folds of mem- brane ; but this is not a common occurrence. I have seen the delicate peduncle by which the cyst was attached to the epididymis as long as three quarters of an inch. M. Gosselin states that small cysts are sometimes deve- loped in the little appendage to the tunica va- ginalis so often found connected with the upper part of the testicle.* This I have never seen. So common are small cysts connected with the epididymis in the various states and stages I have described, that it is impossible to examine many testicles, especially of persons beyond the age of puberty, without finding them. According to M. Gosselin f, they are liable to be developed from the period of puberty to the age of thirty or thirty-five, but are rare at this period. After the age of forty they are very common, having been met with by him in at least two thirds of the testicles examined. Now when one or more of these cysts, instead of becoming pedunculated, en- large so as to form a tumour in the scrotum * Archives Ge'nerales des Mexlecine, 4e Se'rie, t. xvi. p. 27. f M. Gosselin has given an elaborate account of the cysts connected with the epididymis, in two pa- pers published in the 16th volume of the Archives Ge'nerales de Medicine. He makes two varieties of them, the small and large, and states that sperma- tozoa are found only in the latter. This distinction I consider to be unfounded, the smaller cysts being simply the early stage of the larger. M. Gosselin assumes the credit of being the first to describe the small cysts. They were, however, minutely de- scribed by me, and illustrated in my work on the Diseases of the Testis, published in 18-A3, of which M. Gosselin could scarcely have been ignorant, since he refers to my account of this form of hydrocele. 3 s"3998 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). they constitute the form of hydrocele, called from its original seat, encysted hydrocele of the epididymis. I have observed this description of hydrocele in all its various modifications, from the enlargement simply of a single cyst to the complication occasioned by the varied de- velopment of several. As a cyst enlarges the epididymis becomes flattened, and displaced to one side, whilst the testicle is found either in front or at the bottom. It is sometimes at the side, but rarely at the posterior part of the swelling. In the above woodcut {Jig. 640.) of a spe- cimen in the London Hospital Museum, the cyst is above the testicle, which is so dis- placed by it that its anterior edge is directed downwards. The tumour is generally of smaller size than a simple hydrocele, the fluid commonly not exceeding three or four ounces in quantity. I have, however, removed as much as thirty-two ounces from a single cyst. When the hydrocele is composed of several cysts, they are seldom of large size, but form a cluster more or less complicated and irre- gular, according to their size and number. A curious sacculated arrangement produced by the development of numerous contiguous cysts may be seen in the annexed figure, {Jig. 641.) taken from a preparation dissected by Fig. 641. myself: part of the walls of the cysts are cut away to exhibit their interiors. The cysts are liable to inflammation, which causes more or less alteration in the quality and appearance of the fluid contained in them. The fluid may become albuminous and assume the straw or amber colour of ordinary hydrocele; and the cyst may contain lymph, form adhesions, or be lined with a false membrane, the fluid being thick and turbid. The cysts sometimes also become filled with blood, constituting a variety of haematocele. 2. A cyst may form between the tunica albuginea and the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis, separating the two membranes which are naturally closely adherent to each other. This is a very rare form of hydrocele. A spe- cimen which I discovered accidentally in dis- section, is represented in the annexed wood- cut. {Jig. 642.) The cyst contained about two Fig. 642. drachmsof fluid, and is situated along thefront of the testicle; it is a little thickened. A sec- tion of it is preserved in the Hunterian Museum. Sir B. Brodie has described a very similar specimen.* Tn the museum of St. Thomas's Hospital there is a specimen of a small cyst apparently developed from the epididymis : in its subsequent growth it had extended on the fore-part of the testicle, separating the tunica vaginalis from the tunica albuginea. 3. In examining a healthy testicle I once found six or seven small cysts about the size of currants, studding the surface of the loose portion of the tunica vaginalis. Two of them were situated in a part of the membrane ex- tending up the cord. They projected in- ternally, and contained a limpid fluid. I have twice since seen a similar kind of cyst in the same portion of the tunica vaginalis. Similar adventitious cysts have also been observed on the internal surface of the sac of a simple hydrocele, and a preparation of the kind is contained in the Hunterian Museum. If a cyst developed in this membrane were to increase to any size, it would constitute a swelling which might be appropriately termed an cneijstcd hydrocole of the tunica vaginalis. A circumstance of much interest in con- nection with encysted hydrocele of the tes- ticle, is the occurrence of spermotozoa in the fluid contents of the cyst, a discovery made by the late Mr. Liston in 1843. During the last six years I have met with them in as many as twenty cases of encysted hydrocele : indeed, in the majority of instances in which * Lond. Med. and Phys. Journal, vol. lvi. p. 522.999 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 3 s 4 I have searched for them. They were found in had begun to enlarge subjects of various ages from 30 to 75, and in cysts of all sizes from that of a filbert to the largest which the hydrocele attains. The fluid in some instances contained these bodies in remarkable abundance; in others they existed sparingly. When very numerous, they give to the fluid an opaline opacity, or an appear- ance resembling cocoa-nut milk which is so characteristic as to enable the surgeon to pre- dicate their presence from the appearance of the fluid alone without minute examination. If the fluid be allowed to remain at rest in a glass vessel, the spermatozoa subside to the bottom, rendering the lower portion more opaque than the upper. The fluid also ex- hibits slight traces of albumen, when tested in the usual way, which is not the case with the ordinary pellucid colourless fluid of encysted hydrocele. The spermatozoa were often as lively as in fresh semen. They were observed more frequently in the larger cysts than in the smaller. I once found them in fluids removed from two distinct cysts connected with the epididymis of a man about sixty years of age. 1 have detected them in the'fluid from en- cysted hydroceles tapped for the first time, and also in the examination of small cysts connected with testicles removed after death. I removed from an old man aged 75, who had had encysted hydrocele for eight years, and which had never been tapped before, as much as thirty-two ounces of fluid, which contained an abundance of spermatozoa. They were also detected in fluid taken from a man aged 54, who stated that the tumour had existed for eight years, and had never been operated on. Various opinions have been broached to account for the existence of spermatozoa in the encysted form of hydrocele of the testicle. The explanation which seems to me the most reasonable and probable, is that which I offered shortly after the occurrence of sper- matozoa in encysted hydroceles was first dis- covered*, viz. that their presence is probably owing to the accidental rupture of a seminal canal, and the escape of its contents into the cyst of an existing hydrocele. The close proximity of the efferent tubes, the slight tex- ture of the ducts and delicate walls°of the cyst, and the liability of the part to contusion and injury, when a swelling even of moderate size exists, seemed to me to favour this view. The circumstance that spermatozoa are never found in very small cysts show that they are not originally formed there, but are a subsequent addition to their contents. Since my attention has been drawn to this subject I have investigated the history of the cases of encysted hydrocele containing spermatozoa, which came under my notice. In nearly all instances the patients assured me that the swelling had gradually formed after an injury to the tes icle ; and in two cases it was clear that a small cystic swelling had long existed in a stationary state, but after a slight blow I strongly suspect that, in these cases, a duct had been ruptured by the contusion, and that the irritation con- sequent on the injury, and perhaps on the addition of such lively bodies as spermatozoa to the fluid contents of the cyst, had led to its further development. I have, it is true, failed in establishing the fact of a communica- tion between the duct and the cyst by ana- tomical examination. In two instances of large encysted hydrocele containing sperma- tozoa, which I had an opportunity of examin- ing) I injected the vas deferens with coloured size, but the duct was so clogged with semen that the fluid could not be made to reach the head of the epididymis, to which the cyst was attached. In a preparation of large encysted bilocular hydrocele containing spermatozoa, shown me by Mr. Busk, the vas deferens had been injected with mercury, but none of the metal reached the upper part of the epididymis. The cyst evidently arose from the head of the epididymis, and was embedded a little in its substance. In these cases no opening com- municating with a duct could be discovered on examination of the cysts, but this is not surprising, since the communication must be extremely minute, so as readily to escape detection, or it may even have been obliter- ated. Spermatozoa are stated to have been found in some two or three instances in fluid re- moved from the tunica vaginalis. It is not improbable that these cases may have been encysted hydrocles mistaken for simple. The diagnosis is sometimes very difficult, and in the case of the cyst examined by Mr. Paget,* this error was made before death by a hospital surgeon. I have, however, found spermatozoa in the sac of the tunica vaginalis, and the fol- lowing case will account for their presence. A man aged fifty-four died in the London Hospital of disease of the kidneys, of one of the ureters, and of the bladder, which appeared to be consequent on a severe blow on the loins about six weeks before. The tunica vaginalis of one of the testicles contained two ounces and a half of slightly opaque fluid, in which a few spermatozoa were found. There were three small cysts containing fluid immediately connected with the epididymis, and also atone spot an irregular ragged membranous appear- ance, evidently caused by the rupture of a cyst. It is most probable that the spermatozoa had escaped from this cyst, which may indeed have been burst at the time of the injury. I have examined the fluid from the tunica "vagi- nalis in a large number of instances without finding these bodies, and I believe their occur- rence in the common form of hydrocele to be extremely rare. Diffused Hydrocele of the Spermatic Cord.— Mr. Pott has given an admirable account of this affection, under the denomination of hy- drocele of the cells of the tunica communis.\ It has likewise been particularly described by * Practical Treatise Appendix, p. 541. on Diseases of the Testis. * Medico-chirurgical Trans., vol. 2 f Vide his Treatise on Hydrocele. '. p. 398.1000 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). Scarpa.* The disease is of the nature of simple oedema, a watery fluid being diffused throughout the areolar tissue connecting the vessels of the spermatic cord, and enclosed in a sheath, which is invested by the museulo- aponeurotic structure of the cremaster muscle. When the complaint has lasted some time, the sheath is found more or less thickened. The areolar tissue within is infiltrated with a limpid albuminous serum of a white or yel- lowish colour, which flows out in the course of the dissection. The cells infiltrated with serum are converted into large vesicles, some of which are big enough to admit the tip of the finger. These cells are larger and more delicate towards the base of the swelling, where they sometimes disappear altogether ; so that there is only one considerable cavity at the lowest and more depending part. The base of the swelling corresponds to the point at which the spermatic vessels join the testicle, and at this part a dense septum cuts off all communication with the tunica vaginalis. Jn some instances the effusion extends along the cord into the abdomen, as in a remarkable case related by Mr. Pott. In the annexed figure of this affection, {fig. G43.), taken from Scarpa, the envelope of the cremaster is laid open, ex- posing the pyramidal swelling enclosed in its sheath of condensed areolar tissue. The tes- * Memoria sull' Idrocele de Cordone Spermatico. Bertrandi, an Italian surgeon, in a memoir pub- lished by the French Academy of Surgeiy, in 1778, has given an accurate description of this affection, ■which, however, he did not sufficiently distinguish from the encysted hydrocele of the cord. He dis- sected on the dead body a diffused hydrocele, which contained twenty ounces of fluid. tide and tunica vaginalis are seen below it. In general anasarca the areolar tissue of the spermatic cord, as well as of the scrotum, is frequently distended with serum; but cedema of the cord alone is a very rare affection. Sir A. Cooper makes no allusion to it, and Mr. Pott, to whom we are indebted for so good and accurate a description of this species of hydrocele, probably met with a greater num- ber of cases of it than have occurred in the practice of any surgeon since his day. Encysted Hydrocele of the Spermatic Cord.— A cyst containing fluid may be developed in the loose areolar tissue of the spermatic cord. The cyst is formed of a thin transparent membrane, possessing the ordinary characters of a serous membrane, and contains generally a limpid aqueous liquid, having little or no albumen, but sometimes a straw-coloured serum similar to the fluid of simple hydrocele. It is of an oval form, and its size, though variable, seldom exceeds that of a hen's egg, and is usually smaller. It is loosely attached by areolar tissue to the vessels of the cord which are situated at its back part, but be- come separated and displaced by it. The cyst is invested by the common integuments, super- ficial fascia, musculo-aponeurotic sheath of the cremaster muscle, and fascia transversalis. It may occur either immediately above the tes- ticle, in the middle of the cord, or just below the abdominal ring, and even within the in- guinal canal. Usually there is a single cyst, but occasionally several are developed, and a chain of them has been formed along the cord. The cyst anil its contents are liable to changes consequent upon inflammation. Encysted hydrocele of the cord appears to originate, in general, in a partial or imperfect oblitera- tion of the prolongation of peritoneum drawn down at the period of the transition of the testicle. I have already described the different appearances presented by the remains of this prolongation, which, it has been remarked, sometimes consists of a single cyst, or of two or more sacculi, moistened by a serous fluid. When this fluid accumulates in any quantity, an encysted hydrocele is the result. Such is obviously the mode of origin of this affection when occurring in infants, and no doubt in adults it generally originates in the same way. M. J. Cloquet has remarked that the remains of the peritoneal process accompanying the testicles in their descent were met with in male subjects of all ages, and he mentions as a singular circumstance, that they were nearly as frequently found in the old as in the young subjects.* My own dissections agree with the observations of this accurate anatomist. In the museum at the London Hospital there is a preparation showing the tunica vaginalis continued for about two inches up the cord, and, immediately above it, an encysted hydro- cele, which was taken from an adult subject. In dissecting the body of a man, aged eighteen, I found an encysted hydrocele of the cord * Description of the parts concerned in Inguinal and Femoral Hernia, tr. by McWhinnie, p. 26.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1001 above the testicle in close contact with the tunica vaginalis. Immediately above this cyst, but quite distinct from it, there was a narrow and empty serous sac three inches in length, with a contracted neck, and communicating with the abdomen. They are figured in the accompanying engraving, with the hernial sac Fig. 644. laid open, anil part of the parietes of the encysted hydrocele cut away to expose their interiors. The position of the testicle is so changed that its anterior border is directed downwards. In the examination of the body of a man who died of disease of the heart, I found on the right side a thickened and empty serous pouch, extending for about an inch and a half below the external abdominal ring. Directly below it was an independent cyst, capable of containing a walnut, similar in structure to the hernial sac, but lined by a thin false membrane. The tunica vaginalis, which was healthy in structure, extended up the cord as far as the cyst, from which it was separated by a thick and firm partition. In opening the body of a sailor who died with ascites, I noticed at the internal ring a small, delicate, transparent, pedunculated cyst, not larger than a nut, projecting into the cavity of the abdomen. In the spermatic cord, there was a large serous cyst, which extended into the inguinal canal, and contained a small quantity of transparent fluid. A small orifice at its upper part opened into the peduncu- lated cyst, which proved to be a process from the cyst in the cord. In fig. 644., I have given a representation of an inguinal hernia, combined with an elongated encysted hydro- cele of the cord; and in fig. 647 , a repre- sentation of an encysted hasmatoeele of the cord, in which the tunica vaginalis remained unobliterated as far up as the cyst, whilst a hernial sac is situated immediately above it. These dissections confirm the view taken by Sir A. Cooper, and now commonly adopted, of the mode of origin of encysted'hydrocele of the spermatic cord in the adult. Complications of hydrocele.— The following are the principal: 1. Simple hydrocele, com- bined with encysted hydrocele of the testicle. 2. Simple hydrocele, combined with encysted hydrocele of the spermatic cord. 3. Simple hydrocele, combined with diffused hydrocele of the spermatic cord. 4. Oscheo-hydrocele, including both simple hydrocele and encysted hydrocele, combined respectively with inguinal hernia. 1. The first is not an uncommon compli- cation. In the dissection of these parts, I have often found the tunica vaginalis distended with three or four drachms, and even an ounce or two of serum, two or more small distinct cysts being at the same time connected with the upper part of the epididymis ; and I have twice met with this complication in both sides in the same individual. The small adventi- tious cysts appear to be the original disease, the irritation produced by them being in all probability the cause of the increased quan- tity of fluid in the tunica vaginalis. 2. The second complication is somewhat rare. In the pathological collection at the London Hospital, there are two specimens of a collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis as- sociated with an encysted hydrocele of the spermatic cord. In one of them the tunica vaginalis is unobliterated for about two inches along the spermatic cord, and the encysted hydrocele is immediately above it. In the other preparation it is apparent that both sacs have been the seat of inflammation, false mem- branes being contained within them. This complication sometimes occurs in infants. 3. Simple hydrocele associated with dif- fused hydrocele of the cord is also rare. A good delineation of this complication is given in Scarpa's work. 4. Scrotal hernia may be combined with hydrocele. A voluminous hydrocele, if un- Fig. 645.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1002 supported, appears to be highly favourable to the occurrence of hernia and the extension of the sac, by dragging down the peritoneum. Oscheo-hydrocele is not an uncommon complication. In most of the cases which I have met with, the hydrocele was placed be- low and free of the rupture, and in a few only in front of it. I have never found the hernial sac covering the fore part of a hydrocele. The ordinary relations of hydrocele and scro- tal hernia may be seen in the accompanying woodcut. In figure 638., the sac of an in- guinal hernia is represented at some little distance above a small hydrocele. Dupuytren states that, when a hydrocele is placed in front of a hernia, a part of the omentum or intestine sometimes descends into a cyst, which projects into the hydrocele, and is formed of the hernial sac and serous fold of the tunic of the testicle.* This complica- tion is of the nature of the hernia infantilis, described by Mr. Key, and called by Sir A. Cooper encysted hernia of the tunica vaginalis. Hematocele. — This is a term applied to the swelling occasioned by effusion of blood in the sac of the tunica vaginalis, or in a cyst connected with the testicle; it is also applied to tumours produced by extravasation, either in the sub- stance of the spermatic cord, or in the sac of an encysted hydrocele of this part. Hcema- tocele of the testicle, in which blood is effused into the tunica vaginalis, is by far the most common form of this affection. The extra- vasation may take place in a healthy state of the parts, or it may succeed, or be combined with hydrocele. The first variety occurs from the accidental rupture of some blood-vessel, probably one of the vessels ramifying between the tunica albuginea and tunica vaginalis testis, owing either to a blow or a violent straining effort. The second variety, in which the extravasation takes place in combination with hydrocele, is of more frequent occur- rence than the first. It may also be produced by a blow, or by the wound of some vessel, in the operation of tapping. A blow occa- sions a slight rupture of the tunica vaginalis, and of some of the enlarged vessels ramifying outside it, and the blood which escapes passes into the sac and mixes with the fluid of the hydrocele, producing a sudden increase in the size of the tumour. The liability to this ac- cidental effusion of blood is increased by a diseased condition of the arteries, such as is commonly met with in old people. The quan- tity of blood effused under these circum- stances varies considerably. It may be merely sufficient to impart a red tinge to the serum. In general, however, it is greater in amount, and coagula are formed, which remain undis- solved in the fluid. A haematocele may be produced in the operation of tapping a hydro- cele, in two ways. It may be occasioned by the accidental wound of some vessel rami- fying over the tunica vaginals, which, instead of bleeding externally, or into the areolar tissue of the scrotum, pours its blood into * Lefons Orales. Brussels edit. t. iv. p. 233. the sac of the hydrocele ; or it may be caused by the trocar or lancet penetrating too far, and wounding the testicle or spermatic artery. In hematoceles which have existed for a long period, the blood becomes changed into a substance resembling coffee grounds, of a brownish-red, or chocolate colour, and more or less fluid. The coagula sometimes present a cellular or honeycomb appearance, the cells being filled with a reddish serum. Occasion- ally the blood is found converted into a solid fibrinous substance, of a yellow or fawn colour, arranged in firm layers, similar to the coagula lining the sac of an aneurism. In many in- stances the effused blood is felt as a foreign body, and produces inflammation in the tunica vaginalis, which becomes coated with lymph, and this mixing with blood and serum modi- fies the appearance of the contents of the cyst, rendering it turbid and of a lighter colour. Sometimes the inflammation goes on to suppuration, in which case pus is also found in the sac. The inflammation usually extends from the tunica vaginalis to the areolar tissue and fascia external to the sac, which in recent cases are found infiltrated with serum and lymph, and in cases of old standing be- come greatly thickened, indurated, and com- pacted. In a case of haematocele, occasioned by the wound of a vessel in tapping a hydro- cele in which I was consulted, the inflamma- tion which ensued caused, in the course of a fortnight, great thickening of the tissues ex- ternal to the sac, and the formation of an abscess in the scrotum on one side of the hematocele. I have found the tunica vagin- alis and tissues investing it as much as half an inch in thickness, and very firm and dense. These changes in the sac are produced by a more chronic form of inflammation of the fascia and areolar tissue investing the sac. In these old cases, the internal surface of the tunica vaginalis instead of presenting its na« tural smooth and polished surface, is rough, granular, and irregular, and feels as dense and tough as a piece of leather, having lost all the characters of a serous membrane. In haematocele, the testicle preserves the same relation to the remainder of the tumour as in simple hydrocele, being situated at the posterior part, and rather below the centre. Its position, however, is liable to similar al- terations as occur in hydrocele, and they are dependent upon the same causes. A young man had a hydrocele, which had succeeded to an attack of secondary orchitis, occasioning an adhesion of the gland to the front of the sac at its lower part. The case became con- verted into a hematocele by the wound of a vessel in the operation of tapping. Inflam- mation ensued, and it became necessary to lay open the sac. The surgeon, in carrying the incision to the lower part of the tunica va- ginalis, divided the vas deferens and severed the sound testicle nearly in two with his bis- toury, the thickening around the sac having prevented him from detecting the gland in its unusual situation. In hematocele, the1003 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). glandular structure of the testicle sometimes disappears in the same manner as in old cases of hydrocele, atrophy being occasioned by the long continued pressure arising from the ex- travasated blood. Sir B. Brodie has recorded two cases of old haematocele, in which the testicle was completely atrophied.* In the examination of a large haematocele which had existed for many years, and was removed by operation, under the impression that it was a solid enlargement of the testicle, I found the tunica vaginalis nearly half an inch thick, and full of a soft friable substance of a chocolate colour; the testicle, which was situated at the posterior part of the cavity, was some- what flattened, and partly imbedded in the thickened cyst; but the glandular structure was perfectly healthy, and the bulk of the organ scarcely less than natural The haema- tocele, with the sac and testicle laid open, is represented in the accompanying figure. The Fig. GiG. structure of the testicle is usually indeed sound in haematocele, but its nutrition becomes im- paired when the disease is of very old stand- ing. Encysted hematocele of the testicle, or effusion of blood in a cyst connected with the testicle, is an extremely rare affection. The following is the only case of the kind that I have met with. I was requested by one of my colleagues at the London Hospital to examine a case of painful tumour connected with the left testicle. The patient, aged eighteen, had injured the part three months before. The scrotum was much swollen at the time of the accident, and the tumour formed afterwards. It was about the size of a chesnut, quite moveable, but attached to the epididymis. The cyst was opened with a lancet, and exit given to a quantity of dark coagula lodged in a thickened cyst, the interior of which was lined by a rough false membrane. No doubt the cyst existed before the injury, which caused effusion of blood and inflammation, and thickening of the cyst. Hematocele of the sjiermatic cord is an affection which was first noticed by Mr. Pott. It is generally produced by the accidental rupture of a spermatic vein, during violent and sudden exertion, as in straining to life a heavy weight, when blood immediately es- capes into, and infiltrates the loose areolar tissue along the cord, where it accumulates, its further diffusion being prevented by the fascious envelope of this part. Mr. Pott has related three cases, all of which happened in this way. I have met with this variety of haematocele, coupled with extravasation in the scrotum, in two or three instances of contusion, of this part. In one case in which the effusion in the cord was on the left side the spermatic veins were varicose. Encysted hcematocele of the spermatic cord results from the effusion of blood into the cyst of a hydrocele of this part. But it is an affection only known to me from preparations. In the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hos- pital there is a specimen of the kind. The cyst is empty : but it is described to have contained blood, and its walls are deeply stained with the colour of partially decom- posed blood. Its lining membrane is wrinkled and coarsely granular, and the tissues around Fig. 647. * Lond. Med. and Phys. Journal, vol. lviii. p. 299. lj testicle; 2, hernial sac; 3, encysted ha-raatocele.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1004 it are thickened, brawny, and adherent toge- ther. In the Hunterian Museum there is a specimen (No. 2460.) of old encysted haema- tocele of the spermatic cord. A good-sized cyst, lined by a membrane, polished and a little wrinkled, is filled with a soft, tawny- looking granular matter, resembling the altered coagulum of blood observed in ordinary hasmatocele after long maceration in spirit. The tissues around the cyst are thickened and indurated, just like those around an old haematocele of the testicle. There is a hernial sac immediately above it, and a hydrocele below, with the sac open for some distance up the cord as far as the cyst of the hema- tocele. The latter does not communicate either with the tunica vaginalis, or the hernial sac. In the Musee Dupuytren at Paris, I also saw a preparation of this affection, which occurred in the practice of the late M. Blandin. Orchitis. — Inflammation of the testicle occurs in two forms, acute and chronic ; and it may commence either in the body or secre- ting part of the organ, or in the epididymis. Inflammation beginning in the body of the testicle may be idiopathic, or may be excited by external violence: the disease is at first confined to the interior of the organ, the epididymis and tunica vaginalis being affected only secondarily, and sometimes entirely es- caping. Orchitis is far more frequently a consecutive affection than a primary, the in- flammation being transmitted from the urethra along the vas deferens. In this latter form of orchitis, which is familiarly known by the term hernia humoralis, the epididymis is first attacked, and the tunica vaginalis generally participates in the disease. Acute Orchitis. — Few pathologists have examined a testicle in a state of acute inflam- mation, and I am unacquainted with any au- thentic account of the alterations in structure from inflammation originating in the body of the gland. I have twice had the opportunity of examining a testicle affected with acute se- condary orchitis ; and thefollowingdescription of the pathological appearances is drawn up from these investigations, and from the ac- count of the dissection of two testicles affected with gonorrhoea! inflammation recorded by M. Gaussail.* The tunica vaginalis is more or less distended with lymph or albuminous matter, infiltrated with reddish serum, which form loose adhesions between the opposed surfaces of the membrane ; these adhesions are so slight as easily to admit of being broken down with the finger. The membrane is in- jected with a multitude of minute red vessels which ramify in various directions and form a compact network. At a later period red ves- vels may be traced proceeding from the free surface of the tunica vaginalis to the false membranes forming the adhesions. The vo- lume of the testicle appears very little if at all increased, the great bulk of the tumour * Memoire sur l'Orcliite Blennorrhagique, Ar- chives Gene'ralcs de Me'decine, torn, xxvii. p. 210. being occasioned by the swollen epididymis and effusion into the serous sac. When cut into, the gland appears somewhat darker than natural, from a congested state of its vessels. The epididymis, particularly the lower part, is enlarged to twice and sometimes, thrice its natural size, and feels thick, firm, and in- durated. This enlargement is produced by the effusion of a brownish deposit in the areolar tissue between the convolutions of the duct. The coats of the vas deferens are thickened, and the vessels ramifying near them injected, sometimes along the whole extent of the duct. Albuminous deposit is found in the areolar tissue around the tortuous part of the vas deferens and tail of the epididymis, which frequently forms the bulk of the swelling ob- served in these cases. Owing to the epidi- dymis being the part chiefly and most con- stantly affected in consecutive orchitis, some of the modern French writers have denomin- ated the disease epididymitis. In treating of the acute inflammatory changes in the tunica vaginalis, I particularly remarked that the inflammatory action was very liable to extend to the substance of the epidi- dymis, but not to the body of the testicle, and I noticed the pathological law enunciated by Gendrin, by which the circumstance was ac- counted for. We find, too, that inflammation of the epididymis is much more readily pro- pagated to the tunica vaginalis than inflam- mation originating in the glandular structure of the testicle. When inflammation com- mences in the body of the gland, the enlarge- ment takes place slowly, and is seldom con- siderable until the disease has existed for some length of time, which is easily explained by the unyielding texture of the tunica albu- ginea, and the circumstance of the tunica vaginalis remaining unaffected. Suppuration occasionally takes place in this form of orchitis, whereas in consecutive inflammation the form- ation of pus in the substance of the gland is of rather rare occurrence. I do not mean, hovvever, to assert, that the glandular struc- ture of the testicle never suffers in consecutive orchitis, for I believe that it does so in some instances ; but, according to my observations, and I have paid some attention to the sub- ject, it very commonly escapes, the inflamma- tion not extending further than to the epidi- dymis. When inflammation terminates in suppuration, the matter is so slow in making its way externally, owing to the density, thick- ness, and low organisation of the tunica al- buginea, that it generally burrows in vari- ous directions, producing numerous sinuses throughout the gland, and disorganising its delicate structure. The matter sometimes be- comes encysted, forming a separate abscess. In these cases, when the matter effused is small in quantity, after all inflammation has subsided, the more fluid particles are absorbed, and the pus remains for a considerable time in the form of an indolent concrete mass, which has been mistaken, after death, for tu- bercular deposit. The pus when found in this concrete state appears at first sight veryTESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1005 like crude tubercular deposit; but on further examination it will be found to be contained in a distinct cyst, from which it may easily be separated, and the structure of the testicle will be perceived to be more or less altered from its healthy state; whereas in tubercular disease, the morbid deposit is in immediate contact with the tubular structure, which, though atrophied by pressure, is usually in other respects sound. Concrete pus may likewise be mistaken for the firm yellow mat- ter effused in chronic inflammation. It differs from it, however, in being friable and easily broken up, and also in being enclosed in a cyst, whereas the yellow fibrinous substance is homogeneous and consistent, and almost inseparably diffused amongst and connected with the convoluted tubuli around it. The distinctive characters just described will be easily recognised on comparing the accom- panying representation of concrete pus en- cysted in the testicle with fi^. 651. Fig. 648. I examined two enlarged testicles taken from a man who died suddenly. Both glands had formerly been attacked with acute inflammation, and for some months before death they had been the seat of chronic pain. In the left testicle, which was the larger of the two, from two to three drachms of thick yellow inspissated pus were contained in a distinct cyst, which occupied the centre of the gland. There was no trace of tubuli, but the remainder of the organ was composed of a fibrous tissue : the sac of the tunica vaginalis was obliterated by close ad- hesions. The tunica vaginalis of the right testicle contained about half an ounce of yellowish serum and in the centre of the gland there was a small concrete abscess, but the tubular structure was apparent and very little diseased. Pus existing in this concrete or in- spissated state often keeps up pain and irrita- tion for a long period, and renders the testicle liable to repeated relapses of inflammation. Suppuration occasionally takes place in the epididymis. In several cases of consecutive orchitis which have come under my care, at a late period of the disease an abscess formed in the areolar tissue around the termination of the epididymis and inflected portion of the vas deferens, and burst at the most depending part of the scrotum. In many instances, after acute orchitis has subsided, the testicle is restored to its natural condition j in other cases, permanent changes of a serious nature are the consequence. I have observed in testicles that have been affected with inflam- mation some time before, that the septa ap- pear to be more distinct, and to enter more largely into the composition of the gland than is natural; that the small seminal tubes are less numerous and apparent ; and that a great part of the organ is converted into a dense white fibrous tissue, without the presence of tubuli. In these cases the fibrinous matter effused in the areolar tissue connecting the tubuli, not having been absorbed after the cessation of inflammatory action, had occa- sioned partial atrophy of the proper structure of the organ, and been converted into the dense tissuejust described. Complete atrophy is one of the most serious results of acute inflammation of the testicle. I have already remarked that the disturbance in the organisa- tion of the testicle consequent upon inflam- mation is the most common cause of wasting. Consecutive orchitis, if not checked in the early stage, seldom subsides without leaving behind distinct traces of its existence, which never disappear entirely during the remainder of the patient's life. The epididymis fre- quently remains enlarged, presenting an in- durated irregular knotty swelling, seated usually at its lower part, which is occasioned by the presence of a dense hard deposit be- tween the convolutions of the duct and around the inflected portion of the vas de- ferens. On making a section of the epidi- dymis in this state, I have often observed not only a highly thickened condition of its duct, but also, in some instances, very considerable dilatation ; so that the point of a fine probe might be introduced into the canal without difficulty, its area being increased four or five times. These effusions about the duct rarely if ever produce its obliteration, the yielding nature of the tissues preventing this injurious result. In old cases the epididymis acquires the density and consistence of cartilage, and sometimes even of bone. These changes are rarely found without the presence of old ad- hesions, obliterating partially or completely the sac of the tunica vaginalis. The coats of the vas deferens are also found for some ex- tent thickened and indurated. The alterations noticed in the body of the testicle have been observed, in some instances, coexisting with those in the epididymis ; but in by far the majority of cases, the glandular structure is unimpaired. In only two cases in which the epididymis was thus diseased, have I remarked a decidedly atrophied condition of the organ. The absence of pressure, owing to the unre- sisting nature of the membrane investing theTESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1006 epididymis, appears to prevent the oblitera- tion of the duct of which it is composed, and thus accounts for atrophy occurring much more rarely after consecutive orchitis than after inflammation originating in the body of the gland, where the delicate seminal tubes are enclosed in the firm unyielding tunica albuginea. Chronic orchitis. — The testicle is liable to a form of inflammatory swelling of a distinct and chronic character, which occasionally succeeds acute orchitis but far more com- monly arises spontaneously. The disease is of importance ; for, if unchecked, it tends to disorganise and destroy the gland. The chief anatomical character of this form of inflam- mation is the deposit of a peculiar yellow, homogeneous, inorganic matter in the struc- ture of the testicle. This substance when first formed is of soft consistence, but after- wards becomes firm and solid, and so closely adherent and intimately blended with the proper structure of the organ as not to admit of separation without much difficulty. In some instances there is a single deposit of this substance in the centre of the glandular structure, as in the preparation from which the annexed woodcut was taken. In others several are interspersed throughout the tes- ticle, portions of sound gland intervening. In a case of chronic enlargement of both testicles taken from a patient who died of ramollissement of the medulla spinalis, I found six or seven separate deposits of this yellow matter in the substance of the right testicle, and a single one only in the body of the left. The small masses as they enlarge coalesce, or the single one increases, until the whole testicle presents an uniform yel- lowish-white appearance. The epididymis is frequently invaded at the same time by a similar kind of morbid deposit, which also tends to obliterate its tubular structure. This, however, is not, as some pathologists suppose, a constant occurrence; for in the majority of testicles thus diseased that 1 have examined, the epididymis had entirely escaped. I have never succeeded in injecting this deposit, or in tracing vessels into it. But the vessels of the testicle generally are enlarged. Patholo- gists have differed as to the particular tissue in which this yellow matter is deposited. Sir A. Cooper and Cruveilhier describes it to be seated in the areolar tissue between the tubuli; whilst Sir B. Brodie is of opinion, that it is secreted from their inner surface, as he discovered the yellow substance in the canal of the epididymis and also in the vas deferens which are continuous with the tubuli. I have had the opportunity of in- specting a testicle affected with this disease, in what seems to me to be its early stage from which examination I think I have been able satisfactorily to confirm this opinion. The testicle was injected with red size, and a section then made of it. The surfaces of the tunica vaginalis were partly adherent, and about three drachms of serum were collected in one part of the sac. The body of the tes- ticle was not much enlarged : it contained, however, an abundant deposit of a firm opaque matter. Near the anterior edge of the testicle this deposit appeared in the section like round isolated yellowish-grey bodies, separated from each other by portions of the sound structure of the gland : about the centre of the organ it assumed a beaded arrangement, and towards the mediastinum formed a number of closely- set yellow lines or processes, radiating towards the posterior part of the testicle, where they were amalgamated into one uniform mass. Further examination perfectly satisfied me that this matter was lymph deposited in the tubuli seminiferi. The isolated and beaded appearances in the section resulted from breaks in the lymph thus deposited. The real seat of the effusion was very evident, from the arrangement described near the mediastinum. With a good lens some of the convoluted tubuli could be distinctly seen, filled with and dilated by the morbid deposit. A portion was carefully examined in the microscope with a similar result. The epididymis was Fig. 650. 1, fistulous sinus leading to the suppurating ca- vity in the head of the epididymis; 2, concrete ab- scess in the tail of the epididymis.1007 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). much enlarged ; its head was filled with soft concrete matter, surrounding an irregular cavity with which a fistulous sinus com- municated ; its tail contained a similar sub- stance without any external opening. The various appearances described are depicted in the adjoining figure, which was taken from the recent specimen. Similar appearances to those noticed in this case have been described and figured by Cruveilhier, in his " Anatomie Pathologique." * He considers that the dis- ease proceeds from the head of the epidi- dymis towards the tail, and that the body of the testicle is affected only consecutively. I believe, myself, that the yellow deposit is the ordinary result of chronic inflammation of the testicle in whatever way produced ; but that the peculiar appearances noticed in the case just related and likewise described by Cru- veilhier, — I mean the small isolated masses in the substance of the gland, and radiating towards the mediastinum, — are only observed in those cases in which the disease originates in the epididymis, and thence spreads to the body of the testicle, and in which the part is examined before the organ has become ex- tensively diseased. These appearances are not often seen, because it is not often that it becomes necessary to remove a testicle in such a condition, which is indeed a curable one unless complicated with suppuration. Cruveilhier supposes that this matter is effu- sed in the areolar tissue of the testicle, and radiates along the fibrous prolongations from the corpus Highmori. I feel satisfied, however, from my own observations, that he is mis- taken, and that the interior of the tubuli is the original seat of the deposit. This yellow substance has been called the yellow tubercle of the testis ; but, as it differs from tubercular deposit, the term is objectionable and liable to lead to error. It is evidently coagulable lymph, which becomes more solid in the testicle than in most other parts, owing, per- haps, to the condensation consequent on the firm resistance offered to any enlargement of the gland by the unyielding tunica albuginea. This disease is often accompanied with effu- sion of serum into the tunica vaginalis, seldom amounting, however, to more than three or four ounces. Lymph also is sometimes de- posited, and the sac may become partially, or totally obliterated by adhesions. The peculiar matter effused in this disease under appropriate treatment undergoes com- plete absorption, the testicle being left in a condition to perform its natural functions. It sometimes happens, however, that ulcera- tion ensues in its tunics and integuments, and that a fungous-looking growth gradually pro- trudes through the opening which is thus formed. This fungous growth is sometimes termed granular sive/ling ; it has also received the name of liernia testis, being formed in a manner very analogous to that of a hernia cerebri, in which the substance of the brain is protruded through an ulcerated opening in • Liv. v. pi. b., and liv. ix. pi. i. the dura mater. It appears that the yellow deposit after some time excites ulceration in some part of the tunica albuginea. The tunica vaginalis, and afterwards the skin, become adherent at this spot, and likewise inflame and ulcerate. The resistance afforded by the dense unyielding tunica albuginea being thus removed, the adventitious deposit gradually presses out the tubular structure, which forms a projecting tumour consisting of the tubuli mixed up with this yellow substance, and also of ordinary granulations which spring up from the seminiferous structure. This projecting growth presents an ash or yellowish-white ap- pearance, varied by irregular patches of a pale red hue, and sometimes of black. It is closely girt by the scrotum, the ulcerated edges of which are often thickened and everted, {fig. 651.) Fig. 651. The mass often projects so much that scarcely any part of the organ is contained within the scrotum. Though this hernial growth occurs most frequently in an advanced stage of the chronic form of inflammation, it is developed in other diseases of the organ which occasion ulceration of the tunica albuginea, and thus afford an opening for the escape of its con- tents. It is occasionally the result of an attack of acute inflammation supervening upon the chronic disease, and terminating in suppuration in the substance of the gland. In a case of this kind, in addition to the glan- dular swelling, there are sinuses more or less numerous, which burrow in the interior of the organ, and discharge pus mingled with the yellow matter. An attack of orchitis, origin- ally acute, going on to suppuration, is also liable to be followed by a fungous protrusion of the secreting structure of the gland. In the latter case, the growth is not so exube- rant, and the seminiferous structure is more distinctly apparent, owing to the absence of the yellow matter ; but there are generally sinuses which furnish a purulent discharge, sometimes mixed with semen. Tubercular matter deposited in the testicle may also lead to suppuration, and the formation of a granu- lar swelling. A testicle after becoming somewhat en- larged from chronic inflammation, often con- tinues indolent and stationary for years, giving rise to very little inconvenience. On examining the organ in this state, the yellow adventitious deposit is found to possess con-1008 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). siderable firmness and consistency ; the tunica albuginea is thickened, and in some places as dense and indurated as cartilage ; and the surfaces of the tunica vaginalis are closely connected by old adhesions. The glandular structure is partly displaced and atrophied by the pressure of the yellow matter; and it often happens after some time, that both undergo a slow process of wasting, so that an enlarged and indurated gland is progressively reduced, until scarcely any thing remains beyond a mere nodule of the size of a nut at which the spermatic cord terminates. I found, on examination of the body of a man who some few years previously had suffered from chronic inflammation of the testicles, both glands much indurated, but about the natural size. In both, the tubular structure was very deficient, its place being supplied by a dense fibrous tissue. At the upper part of the right testicle there was a yellowish de- posit almost as dense as cartilage, and ex- hibiting very little trace of vascularity. In these indurated testicles the epididymis often escapes the morbid alteration affecting the body of the gland ; in other cases, however, the epididymis is also found nodose, irregular, and hard. It will be perceived, from the pre- ceding observations, that the tendency of this chronic disease is gradually to destroy the integrity of the testicle. If the inflamma- tion be checked in an early stage, the gland is left unimpaired ; if its course be not arrested until a later period, the secreting structure is partly disorganised and reduced in size ; but if the disease be allowed to continue un- checked by treatment, the organ is totally destroyed, either by ulceration of its tunics and the escape of the glandular structure in the shape of a fungous growth, or by the slower process of wasting and absorption. Syphilitic orchitis is essentially of the same nature as the chronic orchitis just described. It commonly commences in the body of the gland and rarely terminates in suppur- ation, or in the production of a hernial fungus. Sir A. Cooper states that in the majority of cases the disease attacks both testicles. The eight examples recorded in his work do not, however, bear out this remark; for in only two of them does it appear that both organs were attacked. According to my observation, the disease is more commonly confined to a single gland, though it occasion- ally affects both: this appears to be the opinion also of Ricord.* The appearances on dissection correspond with those observed in chronic inflammation. Tubercular Disease. — In the testicle," this deposit is met with in the crude state, form- ing a yellow caseous substance similar to the tubercular matter occurring in the lymphatic glands. It is sometimes developed in a single mass ; at other times several distinct deposi- tions are formed in different parts of the organ : in both cases at the expense of its glandular structure, which becomes atrophied * Traite Fratique des Maladies Ve'nc'riennes, p. G40. as the disease advances. The epididymis is more frequently affected than the body of the gland. In a specimen taken from a man who died of phthisis, I found the whole of the epididymis occupied by tubercular matter, with scarcely any trace of tubuli; whilst the body of the gland, though small, was perfectly sound and unaffected. (Jig. 652.) In some Fig. 652. cases I have seen two, three, or more distinct tubercular deposits, separated by portions of healthy gland. This was the case in both testicles removed from a middle-aged man who died of phthisis. In some instances these isolated masses appeared to be con- tained in cysts formed by the processes from the tunica albuginea which separate and sup- port the lobules. Sometimes the separate deposits seemed to be coalescing and joining together, so as to form one continuous mass ; and I have found a single mass of tubercular matter surrounded by glandular structure ex- panded into a thin layer. In other specimens the whole testicle was occupied by a homo- geneous cheesy mass, without any trace re- maining of the original structure of the gland. In some instances in which the disease was thus advanced, there was very little increase in the size of the testicle; it only felt heavier and harder than in the natural state. In others, again, there was either a general uni- form enlargement, or an irregular swelling at some part, commonly at the head of the epi- didymis. Some of these testicles, in which the disease was not much advanced, when injected made beautiful preparations, the yellow inorganic tubercular matter contrasting in a marked degree with the vermilion hue of the intervening sound portions of the organ. On several occasions I found a small quantity of serum in the tunica vaginalis, with partial adhesions and depositions of lymph. In a further stage of the disease, the characteristic deposit becomes softened down, and converted into a yellow pultaceous substance, evidently tubercular matter mixed with pus. The ab- scess extends to the scrotum ; and after it has burst and the matter has escaped externally, cavities and sinuses are left which may be said to resemble the tubercular cavities in the lungs. The course of the disease, however,TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1009 in the testicle, more nearly resembles the changes which ensue in tubercle of the ab- sorbent glands. It has been a question whether the tuber- cular matter is originally formed in the areolar tissue connecting the tubuli, or in the tubuli themselves. I have certainly seen this de- posit in the vas deferens near the testicle, and within the ducts of the epididymis. Dr. Carswell has given a representation of a tes- ticle containing a multitude of pale yellow- coloured granular bodies of various sizes, which, he says, were obviously formed by the accumulation of tuberculous matter in the tubuli seminiferi. The epididymis was as thick as the little finger, and its convoluted ducts were obviously filled with a similar deposit. I believe that tubercle may be de- posited in both situations, within as well as between the tubuli. Earthy matter is some- times found in the testicle, generally in the epididymis, the part most frequently the seat of tubercle. This substance is exactly si- milar to the putty-looking chalky matter often observed in the lungs and bronchial glands. It is highly probable that, in these cases, the gland had at some former period been the seat ol tubercular deposit, but I have not yet been able to establish this point satisfactorily. Carcinoma. — This disease occurs in the testicle under the four forms of Scirrhus, En- cephaloid, Colloid, and Melanosis. Carcinoma seldom occurs in the testicle in the dense form which it commonly assumes in the breast. Sir A. Cooper describes a scirrhous disease of the testicle, in which the gland is invaded by a large white mass in lobes or tubercles. The spermatic cord is affected with a similar disease, and the glands of the abdomen become converted into a white solid texture, very unlike that of the fungoid disease. I have a man, 52 years of age, under my care at the present time, with this disease of the testicle. It forms a tumour about three times the natural size, and is almost of stony hardness, especially at the back part. There is also a large indurated tumour in the spermatic cord. This affection of the testicle is very rare, and is charac- terised by its slow progress as well as by its great induration. Enccphaloid cancer is by far the most fre- quent form of malignant disease to which the testicle is liable. When first observed, it is found in one or two masses amongst the tubuli, which gradually become destroyed as the morbid deposit accumulates. The matter is very rarely infiltrated. The testicle at this early period is extremely firm and hard, owing, not to the solid nature of the sub- stance effused, but to the excessive distention of the unyielding tunica alhuginea by the morbid growth within. The glandular struc- ture soon entirely disappears, the whole organ being occupied by the new growth, inter- mixed with and sustained by the septa and fibrous processes from the mediastinum and tunica alhuginea. In some instances a thin VOL. IV. layer of the tubular structure is found ex- panded around a mass of encephaloid matter. At this stage the tunica vaginalis is often dis- tended with serum ; not, however, in any considerable quantity. The tunica alhuginea next gives way, and a portion of the morbid growth protrudes, forming a mass projecting from the body of the gland ; this sometimes occurs in more places than one. The epi- didymis remains for some time unaffected; but, as the disease increases, this part like- wise becomes implicated and destroyed. In one instance I found the tubes in the head of the epididymis (the only part of the gland not destroyed) filled with white matter which, on microscopic examination, proved to be carcinomatous. The scrotum in a short time becomes fully distended by the diseased mass, which presents the well-known appearance of encephaloid cancer , viz. a homogeneous substance of the consistence of brain, and easily broken down with the fingers, of an opaque white colour, and variegated with patches of a pinkish hue. It is sometimes mixed with small cysts containing serum ; at other times with yellow deposits of lymph, resembling that effused in chronic orchitis* These small depositions of yellow fibrine oc- casionally interspersed amongst the carcino- matous matter, are almost peculiar to this dis- ease in the testicle. I have only once observed them in cancer of other parts, and that was in the kidney. As the enlargement goes on, the scrotum becomes adherent to the tumour in one or more places, then ulcerates, and allows the protrusion of the morbid mass, which projects as an open fungus. The scrotum admits however of great distention before ulceration ensues. The mass then becomes less firm, and its consistence varies very much in different parts, the morbid matter being in some a mere pulp, or re- sembling a creamy fluid. It is interspersed with round or irregular patches of dark look- ing coagula, and, when incised, often presents in different places dark minute spots of va- rious sizes, produced by coagulation of blood in the vascular network usually mixed up with the morbid deposit. On macerating these tumours, or on pouring a stream of water on them for some time, a granular sub- stance, the cancerous matter, is washed away, leaving behind a filamentous shreddy tissue or meshes of a delicate areolar texture, w hich may often be found connected to a denser fibrous substance, the remains of the tunica alhuginea. The spermatic cord is often in- vaded by a similar substance; and in an ad- vanced stage of the complaint, large bodies of the same kind, originating in disease of the lumbar glands, are found on the sides of the vertebrae, reaching as high up as the dia- phragm. Masses of a similar kind are sometimes also found in the lungs. The carcinoma- tous matter is often deposited in such abun- dance as to form a tumour of very con- siderable size ; indeed, there is no other dis- ease of the testicle which occasions solid en- 3 TTESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1010 largements of so great a magnitude as ence- phaloid cancer. M. P. Boyer removed a testicle converted into an encephalotd tumour which weighed more than nine pounds.* The vessels of the cord undergo great enlargement in this disease. In one case which I examined, the spermatic artery was found as large as the radial artery at the wrist. Cancerous germs have also been found in the blood contained in the spermatic veins. Encepha- loid cancer of the testicle occurs at all periods of life: no age, indeed, can be said to be exempt from it. There are examples on record of operations for the removal of tes- ticles thus affected, within a twelvemonth after birth. On the other hand I have met with the disease as late in life as the age of sixty-four. It more commonly occurs, how- ever, in the middle period of life, or between the ages of twenty and thirty. Carcinoma has, in some few instances, been found to originate from the tunica va- ginalis, the glandular part of the testicle re- maining for some time unaffected. Cases of the kind have been recorded by Sir E. Homef and Sir A. Cooper. The other two forms of cancer, colloid and melanosis, have rarely been observed in the testicle. A preparation of the former disease is contained in the Museum of Guy's Hospital. The organ is enlarged to four or five times its natural size, but pre- serves its oval form : there is scarcely any trace of the natural structure remaining, its place being supplied by colloid matter. Cru- veilhier has related the case of a man who died of melanosis affecting the hand, lungs, heart, stomach, and other parts. There was a deposit of the same character in each tes- ticle. Cystic Disease. — The cysts developed in the substance of the testicle and constituting this disease vary very much both in number and size, and in the appearance of their con- tents. They may be only two or three in number, or they may exist in a countless multitude and occasion considerable enlarge- ment of the organ. They vary in size from that of a millet seed to the dimensions of a pigeon's egg. At an early period they gene- rally consist of smooth and slightly vascular cysts, closely adherent, and containing a transparent light-coloured fluid. In other cases the fluid is thick, viscid, and highly albuminous, and sometimes tinged with blood. I have never succeeded in detecting sperma- tozoa in the fluid. Sometimes a small ta- bulated growth arises from the walis of the cyst, and increases until it is partly or wholly fiiled and obliterated. The cysts usually in- crease at the expense of the secreting struc- ture of the testicle, which disappears or be- comes much displaced. In some instances the tubular structure forms an expanded layer over the morbid mass. When inflam- mation takes place, fibrine is effused be- tween as well as within the cysts, and be- * Revue Me'dicale. Nov. 1839. f Observations on Cancer, p. 125. Anatomic Pathologique, liv. xix. pi. 3, 4. comes organised; so that the tumour is partly solid and partly composed of cysts containing fluid. After some time, the sur- faces of the tunica vaginalis become more or less adherent, and in old cases the tumour is intersected with fibrous bands. In several specimens of the disease I have noticed small masses of enchondroma interspersed amongst the cysts. In sections the little pearly-looking masses appear as if contained within the cysts. They are however developed between them, and are closely connected with their walls. The occurrence of enchondroma in these cystic tumours has scarcely been noticed by pathologists. There are several specimens in the Museum of the College of Surgeons. Fig. 653. Portion of the section of a testicle in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, with numerous masses of enchondroma between the ci/sts, of the exact size. a. a. enchondroma. One of the specimens of cystic disease in this collection measures five inches in its largest diameter, and three inches in its smallest. Sometimes small tabulated growths arise from a part of the walls of the cyst, and in- crease until the cavity is partly or wholly filled and obliterated by them, in the same manner as in cystic disease of the mamma. The mode of origin of these cysts has not been satisfactorily made out. It has been supposed that they are formed of dilated and obstructed seminiferous tubes ; but as in cer- tain cases the tubular structure exists in the form of a layer spread over the morbid mass, it is clear that the disease could not have originated in this way. This morbid change is evidently quite distinct from the little cysts so commonly developed in the head of the epididymis : indeed this part is rarely affected in cystic affections of the testicle. The dis- ease is considered by some pathologists to be of a malignant character. After removal of a testicle thus diseased, tumours of a carci- nomatous character have afterwards appeared in the lumbar glands and other parts. Mr. Caesar Hawkins showed me several prepara- tions of cystic sarcoma of the testicle which had been removed by operation where this happened, and it occurred also in a case which came under my own observation. The unexpected result in this instance led me to pay attention to the matter, and I am now quite satisfied that the cystic disease may beTESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1011 3 t 2 developed under two forms. In one, it occurs in combination with carcinomatous deposit : Fig. 65L Section of a cystic tumour of the testicle, showing a multitude of cysts of various shapes and sizes, with solid matte)- interposed betwen them. The natural glandular structure is wholly destroyed. in the other and more common form, the tumour is of an innocent character, and free from the risk of disease attacking other parts after removal of the organ. In the former the cysts are larger and less numerous than in the latter. By careful examination and with the aid of the microscope the coexist- ence of the two diseases may generally be made out. Ossific deposits in the testicle. — Earthy matter occurs in the testicle under two forms : 1. Laminated, and often mixed up with car- tilage ; and 2., as an inorganic deposit. In the first form it is usually deposited between the tunica vaginalis and tunica albuginea, in little bony or cartilaginous patches, in which a fibrous arrangement may be recognised. I have frequently found one or two irregularly- shaped projecting ossific bodies scarcely larger than a pin's head attached to the upper part of the testicle. Ossific matter occurs also on the adherent surface of the tunica vaginalis in old cases of hydrocele, where it has been found so abundant as to form a complete ossific capsule. It has been said that the epididymis alone may be encased in bone, the testicle being free ; this I have never seen. Bony matter occurs, however, in the sub- stance of the epididymis as the result of ossi- fication of the product of inflammation. Earthy matter in this form is not often ob- served in the substance of the testicle. The gland, however, when atrophied and reduced to a mere fibrous tissue, occasionally under- goes both the cartilaginous and osseous trans- formation. The cysts developed in the tes- ticle, as I have already shown, are liable to similar changes. In the second form the earthy matter is deposited in an irregular mass, containing very little animal matter; in appearance re- sembling mortar, and very similar to the earthy substance found in the lungs and bronchial glands. It is generally met with in the head of the epididymis, and sometimes in the lower part, and but very seldom in the body of the testicle. As I have already stated, it is most probable that this earthy matter results from the transformation of tubercular matter deposited in the testicle in early life. Loose bodies in the tunica vaginalis. — Loose bodies are occasionally found in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. They are small in size, and of an oval flattened shape, and their sur- face is smooth and polished. Their texture is in most instances elastic and homogeneous, resembling the unattached cartilages found in joints, and points of ossification are often contained in their interior. In some speci- mens I have observed the cartilaginous matter to be arranged in concentric laminae. The loose body is sometimes entirely composed of bony matter. On examining a thin lamina of one in the microscope, I could distinctly see small oval corpuscules with a number of lines proceeding from them very similar to those of bone. They seldom exceed three in number, and they occur generally in combination with hydrocele, the loose bodies being the original disease. Faelal remains in the testicle. — The remains of a foetus have been found in some rare instances, in the scrotum, in connection with the testicle. Several examples of the kind have been collected by Ollivier (D'Angers).* In all these cases it was evident that the scrotal inclusion had succeeded to an inclusion origi- nally abdominal; that is to say, that the organic debris were first situated in the ab- domen in connection with the testicle, and had accompaniad the gland in its passage out of that cavity. In the cases in which the particular testicle was indicated, the right was the one affected. Varicocele is a term applied to a morbid dilatation of the spermatic veins. On dis- section they are found dilated, elongated, and more tortuous than natural, and apparently more numerous, owing to the enlargement of the smaller vessels. In an advanced stage of the disease, their coats are thick- ened ; so that when divided the vessels re- main patent, and thus present the appear- ance of arteries. The enlarged veins hang down below the testicle, and reach upwards into the inguinal canal; and w hen very volu- * Memoire sur la Monstruosite par Inclusion; Archives Ge'ne'rale de Medicine, t. xv. p. 540.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1012 minous conceal the gland, encroach on the septum, and extend to the other side of the scrotum. In a specimen which I carefully examined, the vessels were arranged in three clusters {fig. 655). One formed of the larger vessels proceeded from the inferior ex- tremity of the testicle ; the second, in which the vessels were less in size, but more numer- ous and tortuous, arose from the upper ex- Fig. 655. tremity of the testicle ; whilst the third and smallest cluster surrounded and accompanied the vas deferens (1). The dilatation is not con- fined to the veins exterior to the gland : even those in the organ itself are varicose, and enlarged veins may often be distinctly seen ramifying between the tunica vaginalis and tunica albuginea. The veins occasionally con- tain phlebolites which are lodged in dilatations of the vessels. The veins of the left testicle are more subject to varicocele than those of the right. In upwards of 120 operations per- formed by Breschet, in only one instance was the varicocele on the right side.* Pott met with this disease on both sides of the body in only one instance. The disease, however, is far from being so rare on the right side as is generally supposed, and often exists on both at the same time, although the varicose state of the right spermatic veins is always much less than that of the left. Of the causes of varicocele, some operate on both sides, others only on one. The most influential of the former is the hydrostatic pressure consequent Landouzy, Du Varicocele, p. 24. upon the depending position of these veins, which have to support the weight of a column of blood extending from the testicle to the second dorsal vertebra. The absence of valves is mentioned as a circumstance conducing to this disease ; but this is an error, for the larger spermatic veins are always furnished with valves, though the dilatation which takes place in varicocele prevents them per- forming their office. There are several anato- mical circumstances, which, taken together, are sufficient to explain the frequency of vari- cocele on the left side. On the right side the spermatic vein joins the vena cava nearly parallel to the axis of that vessel, so that the blood enters in the course of the circulation ; but on the left side the spermatic vein termi- nates in the emulgent vein at a right angle, and in a direction perpendicular to the venous current from the kidney, which is less favour- able to the return of blood from the testicle, since the two currents pursue a different di- rection. The left testicle hangs lower than the right, consequently the veins must be longer, and the pressure produced by the column of blood greater on the left side than on the other. The accumulation of the fseces in the sigmoid flexure of the colon previous to an evacuation tends to produce pressure on the spermatic vein, and impede the return of blood from the left testicle, especially in persons whose bowels are habitually con- stipated. Some persons subject to varicocele suffer from it only when the bowels are in this condition. But even the natural daily accu- mulation may be sufficient to produce ob- struction. To this cause, we must chiefly attribute the circumstance that a varicose di- latation of the veins of the ovary in the female is nearly always confined to the left side. In the slight degree and chronic state in which we most frequently meet with this affection, no injurious effect is produced on the testicle; but when highly or rapidly de- veloped, the dilatation of the veins interferes so much with the nutrition of the gland as to occasion wasting. A partial atrophy of the gland, coexisting with varicocele has come under my notice in more than twenty instances; indeed, in nearly all cases in which there was a decided dilatation of the spermatic veins on one side only, the testicle of that side was the smaller of the two. In a man, aged fifty-six, witli a varicocele on the left side, the testicle was so reduced that it scarcely exceeded the usual size of the organ in an infant. Some years ago, a tall sailor was under my care on account of a varicose ulcer on the left leg, who had a large varicocele on the left side, and a testicle so wasted, that it could scarcely be felt through the tunica vaginalis, which was loosely distended with fluid. The period of puberty is the time at which varicocele most cemmonly occurs. I have met with very few cases before that age. Adipose tumours. — The spermatic cord may be the seat of abnormal depositions of fat. They occur at different parts, as high up1013 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY}. 3 t 3 as the inguinal canal, and as low down as the epididymis. In examining the testicles of a young man who died of pleurisy, I found a quantity of fat along the cord, and around the epididymis, and some also beneath the tunica vaginalis covering the posterior part of the testicle. In another case I met with small isolated masses of fat, coupled with a small encysted hydrocele of the cord. When de- veloped in considerable abundance this de- posit sometimes forms a tumour either in the groin or in the scrotum. A tumour of this kind in the scrotum has been mistaken for omental hernia. I once dissected a lobulated fatty tumour, surrounded by the thickened sheath of the spermatic cord, on the body of a man upwards of eighty years of age, which was very similar in appearance to a portion of omentum contained in a hernial sac. A mass of fat, however, in the cord may form a more defined and distinct swelling. Such a tumour is preserved in the Museum of the College of Surgeons. (No. 2461.) It is em- bedded about an inch above the testicle, in the tissues of the spermatic cord and loosely connected with them. Its shape is oval ; it measures four inches in length, and consists of numerous lobes of soft fat, closely held together by their thin fibro-cellular par- titions. An interesting case of large fatty tumour in the scrotum, originating in the spermatic cord, was seen by several surgeons, in 1844, much difficulty having been ex- perienced in making out the nature of the swelling. The tumour, together with the testicle, was excised by Mr. Lawrence.* Another of the same character, but of smaller size, subsequently formed in the remains of the cord in the groin, and was excised by me in Ma}-, 184-9. Collections of fat in the scrotum have been known from the time of Galen by the term steafocele. I suspect that they all originated from the spermatic cord. Morbid anatomy of the scrotum.— The morbid appearances presented by the scrotum, when the seat of oedema, inflammation, and mortification, so closely resemble those of other parts where loose areolar tissue abound, that they require no particular description. Elephantiasis. — This disease of the scro- tum is rarely seen in Europe, but is of very common occurrence in many other parts of the globe. It consists in a morbid thickening, or hypertrophy of the tissues of which the scro- tum is composed. The epidermis becomes thickened, rough as in icthyosis, and inter- sected with fissures, or chaps. The corium is excessively consolidated, and often nearly an inch in thickness, and very dense. The chief bulk, however, of the tumour, is formed by the conversion of the loose areolar tissue of the scrotum into a large mass of fibrous tissue, infiltrated with a thick jelly-like fluid, evidently albumen, as it coagulates on the ap- * Vide accounts of this case by Lawrence, Me- dical Gazette, May 30. 1845; by Brodie, Lectures on Pathology, p. 271. ; by Edwards, and myself, in Provincial Med. and Surg. Journal, June 25. 1845. plication of heat, acid, or alochol, and some- times on cooling after its removal from the body. The areolae of this tissue vary a good deal in size, but some of them have been found large enough to admit the extremity of the little finger. Examined in the micro- scope this structure exhibits the white and yellow elements of the areolar tissue, in some instances mixed with fat cells. When the part is condensed by inflammation, there are often hardened masses in the substance of the tumour, which has a lardaceous appearance when cut, or resembles cartilage; they some- times undergo conversion into bone. The testicles are buried in the morbid mass to- wards its posterior part, but they are usually sound in structure. Occasionally there is a small quantity of serum in the tunica vagi- nalis. In a case operated on in Calcutta, there was a hydrocele on both sides imbedded in the diseased parts, the largest of which contained between five and six pints of fluid.* The spermatic cords are elongated several inches, owing to the testicles being gradually dragged downwards during the growth of the tumour, but the cords are not otherwise diseased. In the remarkable case of Iloo Loo, a native of China, operated on by Mr. Key, in Guy's Hospital, the cremaster mus- cles were nearly as thick as the finger. The morbid growth is not very vascular. Its arteries are derived chiefly from the external pudic and perineal vessels; but these, owing to the magnitude of the tumour, become greatly increased in size. The veins are numerous, large, varicose, and very tortuous. The integuments of the penis are often affected with a similar disease, and enlarge in the same ratio as the scrotum. In cases where the disease is confined to the scrotum, the penis becomes drawn in and ultimately disappears, being completely imbedded in the tumour ; whilst the prepuce being elongated, opens by a navel-like aperture on the anterior surface of the tumour, as may be seen in the subjoined woodcut. In confirmed cases of elephantiasis, the tumour increases until in the course of years it attains an enormous magni- tude. As this takes place, the skin is bor- rowed from the lower part of the abdomen, so that the hair on the pubes becomes thinly scattered on the front and upper part of the tumour. The tumour assumes an oval or pyramidal form, the apex being superior, and is attached to the body by a thick peduncle extending from the pubes, occupying the whole ot the perineum, and terminating pos- teriorly at the verge of the anus. There is scarcely any limit to the size which the tumour may attain. It has been known to acquire such a magnitude as to weigh mere than two hundred pounds-f-, exceeding the weight of the rest of the body. It has been found to measure more than four feet in cir- * Calcutta Quarterly Journal, Xo. 3. t Case cited from Eplie'me'rides d'Allemagne, by Larrey.

In a case operated on by Clot Bey in Eirypt, the morbid mass, which weighed one hundred and ten pounds, kept the patient's legs far apart, and obliged him to remain constantly on the ground ; it was so bulky that he could even sit upon it. In the accompanying figure Fig. 656. of a black man, affected with elephantiasis, taken from Dr. Titley's work on " Diseases of the Genitals, in the Male," the tumour de- scended nearly to the ankles. Elephantiasis of the scrotum is a morbid affection of the integuments, analogous to the enlargement of the extremities commonly known by the name of Barbadoes leg ; with which, indeed, in those countries where the disease is prevalent, it is liable to be com- bined. Elephantiasis of the scrotum, how- ever, grows to a greater size and makes more rapid progress tban the same disease in the leg, owing to the very loose texture and de- pending state of the parts. The labia pudendi of females in warm climates are subject to a similar change, though not to the same extent rior so frequently as the scrotum. This dis- ease appears to be the result of a low form of inflammation of the veins, and to be analogous to the affection termed phlegmasia du/ens. It is preceded by febrile attacks, attended with pain and heat in the part, and swelling and tenderness of the glands in the groin. After a time, the scrotum continues to enlarge, in- dependently of febrile attacks. In December, 1847, I saw a gentleman, from Barbadoes, who had this disease in the early stage. The whole scrotum was considerably enlarged, forming a doughy inelastic swelling, fissured in two or three places. A portion of skin at the root of the penis was a little red and puffy as if affected in a slight degree. The glands in the left groin were enlarged, but those on the right side were unaffected. The testicles were sound. Hypertrophy of the scrotum is an affection of the same nature as the knotty and lobulated growth of the skin occasionally observed on the nose and in other parts. In this disease the integuments appear as if composed of lobes divided by fissures. In the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital there is a pre- paration of this kind, but no history is at- tached to it. The hypertrophied scrotum appears to have been removed during life. Many years ago I saw a case of the kind at the hospital of La Charite in Paris. The patient was a young man whose scrotum was hypertrophied to about four times its natural size. This disease is liable to be confounded with elephantiasis, but differs from it in the circumstance that the morbid enlargement is entirely confined to the skin, the subcutane- ous areolar tissue being unaffected. Cancer Scroti, or, as it is commonly called, chimney sweeper's cancer, is a disease of the skin, which attacks the scrotum of persons who have been exposed to the contact of soot. It is originally developed in the form of a small pimple or warty excrescence, termed,soo/- wart, which often remains on the scrotum for months or even years without undergoing any change Usually, there is only a single wart at the lower part of the scrotum ; sometimes there are two or three of different sizes ; and occasionally they are so numerous and so abundantly and largely developed as to form a considerable cauliflower excrescence. After a time the wart becomes soft, excoriated and red, and exudes a thin irritating discharge, which becoming dry forms an incrustation over the excrescence. After the scab has been picked off) or rubbed off by friction against the dress, ulceration ensues, destroys the wart and produces a painful chronic sore, possess- ing the ordinary characters of a carcinomatous ulcer on the skin, — thick, indurated and everted edges, and an irregular excavated base, the surface of which discharges a thin sanious fluid. The ulcer, if suffered to proceed, in- Fig. 657. the wart.TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). 1015 3 t 4 creases widely, invading the whole scrotum to the perineum, and laying bare the crura penis. At the same time it penetrates deeply to the tunica vaginalis, which becomes firmly connected to the morbid scrotum and ad- herent to the testicle. This organ may also become involved in the disease, and be the seat of a deep excavated sore. The glands in the groin often enlarge at an early period from irritation ; but at length they become indurated and diseased. The inguinal glands sometimes suppurate, and form intractable ulcers in the groin similar in character to the sore on the scrotum. The ulcer spreads to- wards its circumference widely and super- ficially, whilst in the centre it burrows deeply until in many instances it reaches the great vessels of the thigh, destroys their coats, and causes death by haemorrhage. In other cases the glands remain unaffected, but ulceration advances slowly in the direction of the cord, and a frightful sore is produced. The small excrescence in which cancer scroti usually originates is soft, vascular, and sensitive ; and in many respects similar to the soft warts which occur on the internal membrane of the prepuce and on the glans penis. The soot-wart appears, in fact, to con- sist of a congeries of morbidly enlarged papilla?. The Museum of the London Hospital contains a remarkable specimen of chimney-sweeper's cancer, in which nearly the whole scrotum is occupied by a cauliflower excrescence, which exhibits these papilla? in a very ad- vanced state of developement. It was removed from an old man, about sixty-four years of age, who afterwards left the hospital cured. The morbid growth is composed of a number of projecting processes densely grouped to- gether, of variable size, but many very large, with their summits lobulated, expanded, and elevated on narrow peduncles, more or less flat- tened. _ They are represented in the subjoined engraving. The soot-wart is sometimes co- vered with a dense and thick concretion, formed Fie. 658. by successive layers of incrustation, the su- perficial still remaining attached, so as to form a projecting elongated conical process, which is not unlike the spur of the cock, and when very long is occasionally twisted like the horn of a ram. Some curious excrescences of this kind are represented in the clever etchings of Mr. Wadd.* The subjoined figure taken Fig. C59. from one of them, exhibits the process of its exact size. Upon dissecting a portion of scrotum af- fected with chimney-sweeper's cancer, the part is found to present very similar appearances to those of carcinoma of the lip. The tissue at the base of the ulcer is dense, indurated, and distinctly laminated, and possesses very little vascularity. On examining some matter scraped from the base of a soot-wart shortly after its removal from the body, I perceived a number of caudate and spindle-shaped nucleated cells. Epithelial cells have likewise been observed in several cases, and the dis- ease is regarded as belonging to the epithelial form of cancer. On examining some diseased glands in the groin in a case of scrotal cancer, I found them enlarged and indurated, and composed of a whitish brown or j ellowish white substance, mixed up in some places with a soft curd-like matter, or greyish pus, con- tained in thin w hite cjsts. Carcinoma scroti is, with few exceptions, confined to chimney-sweepers ; and the irrit- ating action of the soot on the skin of the scrotum is no doubt its exciting cause. A similar disease occasionally occurs in other parts of the skin, but the scrotum being sel- dom cleansed and well adapted to harboursoot * Cases-of Diseased Frepuee and Scrotum, pi. x. si. sii.1016 TESTICLE (ABNORMAL ANATOMY). seems more exposed to the disease. Sir James Earle has related the case of a man who had a large sore resembling chimney-sweeper's cancer which reached from the bend of the wrist to the knuckles, occupying almost the whole of the back of the left hand. The man was a gardener, and for several springs had been in the habit of strewing soot on the ground round the young plants to preserve them from slugs. He carried the soot in an old garden pot which hung on his left hand, while he strewed the soot with his right. The predisposition to cancer scroti appears in some instances to be hereditary. The late Mr. Earle extirpated the testicle and diseased integuments from a sweep aged thirty-five, a patient in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, whose grandfather, father, and one brother had all perished from the effects of the disease. A father and son were once in St. George's Hospital at the same time on account of it. Mr. Cusack mentions that he removed a soot-wart from the hand of a female who carried on the business of chimney-sweeping, and that he had previously excised an ex- crescence of the same nature from the ear of her son.* Cancer scroti occurs more commonly at the middle period than at any other time of life. In the majority of cases which I have met with the disease occurred between the ages of thirty and forty. Those exposed however to the action of soot may become affected at a much earlier period. Mr. Wadd has figured a diseased prepuce and soot-wart on the scrotum from a boy aged fifteen ; and Sir J. Earle witnessed a case of the disease as early as at eight years of age. It appears that the seeds of this malady are sown in early life, but in general do not germinate until they have remained for some time dor- mant in the system. What is the permanent effect on the scrotum produced by soot, which thus renders it in certain individuals so pecu- liarly susceptible of a cancerous action at some distant period, we cannot explain; but that the soot, though the exciting cause of the disease, may in some instances be a remote one, is shown by several striking facts. It is known that persons who have been sweeps when young, but have abandoned the occu- pation, have afterwards been attacked with chimney-sweeper's cancer, although they have long been removed from all contact with soot. A sailor between forty and fifty years of age, was admitted into the London Hospital, with an ulcerated sore on the scrotum, presenting all the characters of genuine chimney-sweeper's cancer. The inguinal glands were indurated and enlarged, and subsequently ulcerated. He had been brought up as a sweep ; but for the last twenty-two years, during which period he had served at sea, he had not been em- ployed amongst soot in any way whatever. The disease first appeared in the scrotum * Dublin Journal of Medical Science, vol. xxi p. 137. about three years before. In this case, there- fore, the injurious influence of soot must have been exerted nineteen years before the ap- pearance of disease, during which long period he was entirely removed from the effects of its exciting cause. It has sometimes hap- pened, after the morbid parts had been com- pletely extirpated, and the wound healed, the patient having avoided further contact with soot, that the disease has re-appeared as it were afresh, a second and even a third time ; not, however, in the cicatrix of the wound, but on a different part of the scrotum. These, and similar facts, lead to the conclu- sion that though abandonment of his occupa- tion may render the adult chimney-sweeper less liable to cancer, it by no means forms a satisfactory security against its occurrence. Cancer scroti chiefly extends its ravages by affecting the contiguous tissues, and has little disposition to contaminate the lymphatic glands or distant parts. An instance is on record of an old chimney-sweeper, who had been subject to this disease for forty years, and had undergone three operations for its removal, yet even then the glands in the groin were unaffected.* A man aged fifty-one who had been a chimney-sweeper ever since the age of seven years, was a patient of mine on account of this disease. He had been re- peatedly attacked with it during a period of twenty-two years, and had submitted to no less than five operations for its removal. The glands in one groin became affected only a few months previously. Ulceration took place, and the patient died from its irritative effects on the constitution. On a careful examina- tion of the body, no trace of internal disease could be detected. The cancer was strictly limited to the groin and scrotum. Mr. B. Cooper has likewise recorded a case of chim- ney-sweeper's cancer which ended fatally; and on examination none of the glands or viscera of the interior of the body were af- fected, f These cases show that, when the inguinal glands are indurated, they may be excised with a fair hope of a successful result. Melanosis. — Notwithstanding the dark co- lour of the skin of the scrotum, melanosis is an exceedingly rare affection of this part. Indeed, the only case of its occurrence there with which I am acquainted, is one that hap- pened in my own practice. The patient was a cabinet-maker, aged thirty-two, and the disease commenced as a small dark spot, ap- parently produced by some black deposit be- neath the epidermis, raising it a little above the surrounding surface. This spot increased until it formed a fungous growth. I excised the part, but the disease re-appeared in the scrotum and in the glands of the groin six months afterwards. It made, however, very slow progress, and did not destroy the patient for six years.J * Mr. Hawkin's Lecture on Tumours. Lond. Med. Gazette, vol. xxi. p. 842. f Lond. Med.

It may acquire the size of the testicle, and being firm and of an oval form, resembles a supernumerary gland. 1 have met with only one case of this form of tumour. Dr. Mott, of the United States, excised an enormous mass from the scrotum of a man about seventy-three years of age. The scrotum was twelve to fifteen times its ordinary bulk, and was filled with tumours of a stony hard- ness, from the size of a nutmeg to that of a large pea. The tumours had all a very white appearance, and the integuments over two or three of the largest, having been ulcerated for upwards of a year, poured forth a foetid discharge, together with a white substance resembling mortar. The disease was upwards of twenty years' duration. I have no doubt this disease was originally of a fibrous cha- racter. The calcareous matter and other changes resemble those occasionally observed in large fibrous tumours of the uterus. A tumour of a similar character and of great size was removed by operation from the scrotum of a man in St. Vincent's hospital, Dublin, by Dr. O'Ferrall* Bibliography.—Anatomy. — De Graaf, DeVir.

" The habitation of the breathing parts." — That part of the human body destined to contain the lungs * Dublin Hospital Gazette. Feb. 1845 and heart, and by its movements to maintain the function of respiration. Generally by the term thorax is understood a cavity set apart for the respiratory organs. Such a cavity, however, is not essential to respiration: a respiratory surface only is es- sential. This must exist in every animal, whilst a separate thorax is found perfect only in mammalia. The development of the respiratory surface may take place in three ways. 1st. Either towards the interior of the body, in the form of ramified or sacculated ca- vities ; or, 2ndly. Towards the exterior, in the form of lamellated, ramified, pectinated, tufted, cili- ated, or pinnated processes called " brcunchwe" in which Nature seems to have exhausted all imaginable varieties of form ; and, Srdly. By a system of tubes ramified to ex- treme fineness, either in an especial cavity or thorax, or in a cavity common to these organs and to others destined for the diges- tive function. The movements necessary to respiration, are modified according to the form of the re- spiratory apparatus and the nature of the medium to be respired, whether pure air or air contained in water. In some of the lowest animals, the respira- tory movements are the same as those of loco- motion, as in the monad and other infusorial animalcules. In all animals, even when the respiratory organs are contained in a true thoracic cavity, the frame-work serves other purposes besides that of drawing in and throwing out air ; it gives attachment to the largest muscles of the upper extremity, whe- ther prehensile or locomotive. In man parti- cularly, we find the respiratory muscles con- tribute to such acts as coughing, sucking, sneezing, yawning, sighing, singing, vomiting, as well as the innumerable articulate sounds of language. Distinct respiratory movements, as depen- dent upon alternate contractions and dilata- tions of a thoracic cavity, are most regular, or at least, they have been more noticed, in mammiferous animals. The thoracic cavities of mammiferous animals have much of the mechanism of respiration in common. Thev all possess a vertebral column or spine, and that peculiar frame-work of ribs, together with a sternum, so articulated together as to move in breathing. There is likewise a great similarity of mus- cular arrangement around the thoracic cavity; and consequently the respiratory movements closely resemble each other. Although the boundaries of the thorax are generally the parts which move in respiration, and these are generally composed of vertebras ribs and sternum, yet some animals may have either all of these, or they may lack some of them, or, if present, they may not move in the breathing function. Frogs have a ster- num, but no ribs ; serpents have ribs, but no sternum; tortoises have ribs, vertebra, andTHORAX. 1018 sternum in one mass, rigid and immoveable : the crocodile and lizard have perfect ribs, but their sternum is almost entirely cartilaginous; and, lastly, in man, the components of the thoracic cavity may have a mobility to com- mand or exceed a space equal to the whole cavity allotted for the respiratory organs. The relative quantity of air which he can respire for the aeration of his blood is probably greater than in any other animal, and his movements are more under the control of his will, and are greatly influenced by mental emotions. Classification of the Respiratory Movements in Animals. — It is not easy to name any particular part in the perfect thorax of the higher vertebrata, which is equally destined for respiratory motion throughout the class. Commonly with ribs and intercostal muscles, we connect the idea of a thorax, or a breathing chamber for re- spiration ; but a fish has ribs, and likewise intercostal muscles, yet not for any of the purposes of respiration, nor do we acknow- ledge them to belong to its thorax. A frog has a thorax for respiration with internal lungs, but no ribs, nor, consequently, any intercostal muscles. Nor is a diaphragm necessary to thoracic respiration ; for it is mostly absent in birds and reptiles, and quite rudimentary in the few instances (such as the ostrich, crocodile, and chelonia), in which it is met with. In the chelonia neither ribs, spine, nor sternum are concerned in the respiratory movements. The movements of respiration tend to bring before some surface, air or air contained in water ; or to bring a certain surface con- tinually into a fresh medium, In whatever way this may be accomplished, whether by moving the whole body, or part of the body to and fro, such movements, likewise, are not uniformly for the mere purpose of re- spiration, i. e. the mere purpose of aeration. All reptiles take more air into their capacious lungs than they require for oxygenating the blood, particularly in the aquatic kinds (as in the turtle), where the air serves to buoy up their heavy and slow-moving bodies in the dense element they inhabit. Serpents are provided with numerous highly-moveable ribs and powerful intercostal muscles, capable of rapid and extensive inspiration and expiration. Tney can perfectly distend their body with air. The same may be observed in the chameleon. These volumes of air cannot alone be subservient to respiration, as it cannot all come into contact with the simple undivided respiratory sacs. We see, therefore, there is no necessary rela- tion between the quantity of air an animal may inspire and the extent of respiratory surface. The long hissing sound which serpents pro- duce to alarm their prey, is effected by the expulsion of this great volume of air, by their ribs, through the narrow passages of the nos- trils. In the higher mammiferous animals, we find respiration more especially destined for the chemical purpose of oxygenating the blood. Hence a more limited quantity is taken in, and it is speedily thrown out again. Large animals make fewer respirations than small ones. Ac- cording to Scoresby*, the whale breathes four or five times a minute ; the dog, the cat, and rabbit, from twenty to thirty in the same period ; and in small birds the respirations are remarkably rapid. Whatever be the form of the aerating or- gan, " breathing" is accomplished either by, 1st, the weight of the atmosphere rushing into certain cavities, because certain parts of these cavities dilate and threaten a vacuum ; or, 2ndly, by the direct projectile or collapsing force of an organ throwing the ambient ele- ment onward. These two ways are generally more or less combined in the same animal. Nor does there appear to be any relation be- tween the grade of the animal and the order of respiratory movement obtained. We notice in the respiration of man a regular inspiration and expiration, two currents in different di- rections ; and in the lowest animal, the connecting link with the vegetable kingdom, the porifera, or sponge tribe, there are like- wise two respiratory currents by distinct channels, which are as regular as the motion of rivers from their source to the ocean, or any other movement depending upon the established order of things. In some spe- cies of medusas, there are peculiar sacs on the inferior surface of the body, which, during the expansion of the body, admit water through certain apertures, and again expel it during the succeeding contraction, re- presenting a perfect inspiratory and expi- ratory action. The complexity, therefore, of respiratory movements does not correspond with the increasing development of the breathing organs. Those animals which have an internal sacculated lung, always retain a certain quantity of the breathing element in " reserve " within their system ; whereas those animals which have external lungs, or gills, have no " reserve " respirable medium. They need none, because where there is an exter- nal lung, the ambient element answers the purpose of the "reserve"; it is always in contact with the breathing surface. This " reserve," in mammalia, &c, is not, pro- bably, so necessary to aeration as for the purpose of ejecting any matter which may obstruct the air passages — or, in more po- pular language, for " coughing " up any matter out of the throat. The different kinds of respiratory move- ment may be arranged as follows ; — 1. Infusorial Animalcules By projectile force. 2. Insects - Uncertain. 3. Fishes - - - By vacuum & pro- jectile force. 4. Amphibia - - do. do. 5. Birds ... do. do. 6. Mammalia - - do. do. Of the First Kind of Respiratory Movement.

Art. (Jilia.) Of the Second Species of Respiration. In- sects.— The breathing apparatus in insects generally reaches a high degree of develop- ment. Sometimes respiratory tubes or tra- cheae penetrate every part, in the form of mi- nute ramifying vessels conveying the included air to all the organs. The moving power or means of the renewal of the air in these tubes is at present little known. Some insects, al- though they live in water (as, for instance, the water beetles, and also water spiders), retain a bubble of air around them ; and, according to Nitzch*, they renew the air in the irtrachae by alternately elevating and depressing the an- tennae. Beetles, before flying, seem to inflate themselves with air, so as to unfold their wings, which, like other parts of their body, are supplied with air tubes. In this case an inspirative effort must be made by some cavity. Under certain circumstances, bees emit a voice, a shrill sound, which is indepen- dent of the motion of the wings, and which appears to be connected with the existence of a current of air through the respiratory tubes or tracheae; at least, such has been observed when the animal has been irritated and im- mersed in water, the surface of which, where it was in contact with the orifice of the stig- mata at the root of the wing, evidently vibrated at the moment the sound was produced.\ In the orthoptera particularly, there are distinct respiratory movements, alternate dila- tations and contractions of the abdomen ; in fact, respiratory motions are more distinctly perceptible in this division than in any other in- sects. In the locusta verrneivora particularly, it is easy to distinguish how the abdominal rings, which have smaller abdominal scuta between them inferiorly, are alternately elevated and depressed exactly like ribs. If we smear the great thoracic stigmata with oil, we find that numerous bubbles of air escape from it during these motions. The organs of respiratory motion, by means of which the supply of air is renewed, present many points of uncertainty. On the one hand, where large stigmata are placed opposite to each other, and connected by tracheae, it is easy to see that alternate opening and shutting of their valves may produce a current capable of renewing the supply of air. It is conceiv- able also, how, in the orthoptera, lepidoptera, anil others, the expansion and contraction of the body, and the elasticity of the air-sacs contained in it, may cause the ingress of air. It is less obvious, however, how the same effect is produced in caterpillars and the larvae of beetles, where a current of air cannot very easily arise from the opposite position of the stigmata, on account of the minute ramifica- tions of the tracheae ; and consequently we must look for some peculiar mechanism, pro- bably cilia, unless we are disposed to admit * On the Respiration of the Hydrophila}, in Red's Archiv. B. s. S. 440. t Hunter, Philosophical Transactions. 1792. p. 182. the stagnation of the air in its vessels. Hence it has been conjectured that the dilatation and contraction of the dorsal vessel contributes to this purpose. This, however, appears to be scarcely possible ; and it might be asked on the contrary, if the vermicular motion of the body itself, the sliding of its segments upon each other, are not the means of keeping up the constant ingress and egress of air.* In the lowest of the molluscous class, the external tunic with which they are covered is generally so elastic, that it is capable of dilating by its own properties, when it has been greatly contracted by the muscular coat that is within; and in forcible expirations, Dr. Grant has observed these animals to contract their muscular coat, and to retract the exterior covering, so as to propel, with considerable impetuosity, and to a distance, the water that fills their respiratory cavity. The elasticity of the tunic tends to over- come the resistance of the muscular coat, and to expand, to a certain extent, the respi- ratory cavity. Without, therefore, the existence of elastic ligaments, such as we find in conchi- fera, there is a partial means of enlarging the respiratory cavity given to these tunicated animals. This, however, is only in occa- sional, forced, respiration ; constant and al- ternate contraction and expansion of the ex- terior tunic is not met with in any known tu- nicated, nor in a conchifcrous animal, f The streams that enter the respiratory, and pass out of the anal aperture, are smooth, regular, and incessant, and are produced by ciliary movement. Of the Third Species of Respiration. Fishes. — It may be said that the thorax of fishes usually presents four elastic cartilaginous arches, which approximate and separate, open or close the gills, at the same time increasing or diminishing the capacity of the so-formed thorax. These ribs, or branchial arches, sup- port the gills, which are covered by a great flap (operculum) on each side of the base of the skull. The respiratory current enters at the mouth, passes through the fissures on each side of the fauces, and escapes through the branchial openings, placed laterally, covered by the moveable operculum. This stream is uniformly in one direction, — from before, backwards. It might be asked, why does not the water rush in by the branchial opening when the mouth "threatens" a vacuum ? It will be observed that the margin of the oper- culum, or great lateral flap, is edged with a delicate membrane, which acts as a valve, this, by the pressure of the water, is forced close round the lateral openings : thus, the water, upon the expansion of the jaws, is prevented entering behind, and consequently rushes in towards the gills by the mouth ; the jaws now close, the operculum immediately opens by the * Reimarcns, Ueber das Athmen. in Reil's Arehiv. B. xi. S. 2.; and Xitzsch, Comment, de Bespirat. p. 39. et seq. | Grant's Lecture " On the Respiratory Organs of Invcrtebrata." Lancet, 1833—1, vol. i. p. 964.1020 THORAX. force of the jaws contracting with the mouth full of water, which contraction, or expiration, forces the water through the branchial arches and ultimately out by the lateral openings. Thus the respiration is of a mixed order. The first stage by atmospheric and hydraulic pressure ; the second stage by direct muscular force, similar to that of swallowing. If we cut oft'the delicate fringe around the operculum the fish is suffocated, the opera- tion being analogous to puncturing the human thorax. Fishes also possess a power of regulating their respiration. We have watched fishes when in a quiescent state move their respi- ratory organs so gently that the motion was nearly imperceptible, and at times quite so ; but if at such times you alarm the animal, respiration becomes vigorous, and a compa- ratively vast body of water rushes past their respiratory organs. The same may be like- wise observed when fishes have remained long in a small quantity of water, as if the respira- tory movements became more and more vigo- rous with the deterioration of their element, but give them a fresh supply of water and re- spiration becomes quiescent again. Of the Fourth Species of Respiration. Ampin- Ha.— ln this class there is a gradual develop- ment of the animal formation from an aquatic to an aerial being; so likewise is the aqueous gradually converted into aerial respiration. The respiration of some of these animals is indeed most curious, — curious as to the very limited quantity of air necessary for their well- being, and curious as to whether they have this "limited quantity supplied regularly or otherwise. For instance, you may keep an aquatic turtle out of water for da3's, and it will keep constantly respiring air; immerse it in water, and it will remain below the sur- face for half an hour, or an hour, without any inconvenience, and some of these animals will breathe at the surface during the day, and- sleep at the bottom all night without once rising for air, while during the day the same animal cannot remain below above half an hour without showing signs of discomfort. And again, the common tortoise during hy- bernation breathes so small a quantity of air, that we have never been able to form any calculation of the quantity then respired. In frogs there are no ribs by which the lungs may be moved ; consequently there is no vacuum formed by their thorax dur- ing respiration ; they fill the lungs like the tortoise, the newt, the chameleon, &c, by the working of their jaws ; or, in other words, they swallow their air just as we swallow our food. In this respect their respiratory movements resemble those of fishes; the first process being through the agency of external pressure, by making a vacuum with the mouth ; the se- cond, that of forcing, by the operation of the pharynx. They resemble mammalia in having an internal lung, retaining the air for some time, and in expelling it through the same channel by which it entered. The respira- tion of the frog has gained attention, and is hence better understood than that of many other animals of this class. The following is the mechanism of its respiration, as described particularly by Townson *, though before no- ticed by Swammerdam and Malpighi. When the broad lingual bone which forms the floor of the mouth is drawn down from the pa- late by its muscles, the air of the mouth is rarefied, and an additional quantity enters by the nasal apertures, which admit of being closed by valves. The lingual bone is then raised, the nasal apertures are closed, and the air is now forced, or rather swallowed, through the rima glottidis into the pulmonary sacs, and can also fill the laryngeal pouches which open into the mouth. Expiration is produced partly by the pressure of the abdo- minal muscles, and partly by the peculiar mus- cular power of the pulmonary parietes. To the careless observer the frog does not appear to breathe : it is never seen to open its mouth ; there is no motion of its sides like breathing, and when it is provoked (or rather through fear), though it still keeps its mouth close shut, its sides and back rise, and it blows itself up ap- parently by some internal power. Upon observ- ing it more narrowly, that skinny and bag-like part of its mouth which is under the jaw, is seen to be in constant motion. While this bag is dilating and contracting, the mouth is never opened to take in new air, but it seems to live all the while on one mouthful of air, and seems to be playing it backwards and forwards between the mouth and lungs. If we now observe the nostrils, a twirling motion, which lets in air at each movement of the jaws, is apparent, corresponding to the quantity of air inspired. If we keep the mouth open we present!}' see the animal struggle for breath, for we by this means disable the forcing apparatus from pro- pelling the required air into the lungs. The newt breathes with the jaws and nos- trils like the frog. It has, like the frog, a constant motion, by short strokes of the bag under the jaw. This bag is formed by the membranes of the mouth, covered and moved by the genio-hyoid and mylo-hyoid muscles. Every minute, or less, it stops, as if intending some particular motion ; then gradually the bag swells out under the lower jaw to a great size; the contained air is then pressed down into the lungs, and in propor- tion as the jaws are emptied, the sides of the animal are swelled up. The toad, the chame- leon, and the green lizard breathe in the same way, propelling mouthfuls of air down into the lungs. The chameleon can force down a greater or smaller quantity of air, as its needs or fears prompt it. At times it seems to fill its body almost to bursting with air. The tortoise, like the frog, holds its jaws close, and swallows the air ; alternately depressing and elevating the hyoid bone. The first of these motions permits the air to enter the nostrils, when, the tongue immediately closing their internal aperture, the second motion forces the air into the lungs. It is not un- * Tracts and Obs. on Nat.

We are not prepared exactly to say how the tortoise and turtle expire ; but probably the expiration is performed by the contraction of (he abdominal muscles between the lower shield or plastron and the posterior extremi- ties ; for either of these animals can at will, when alarmed, forcibly expel air with a hiss- ing sound, although its shell is unyielding. The most remarkable respiratory move- ment we have noticed, has been in the com- mon turtle. Sometimes this animal will swell out his hard case, the sternum or plastron yielding to some internal force ; but it is diffi- cult to say by what means this is distended and kept distended. It is clear this animal can gorge itself with air until it cannot sink in water, and that at pleasure it can disgorge itself and fall to the bottom, where it lives upon only a fraction of the quantity of air it had just previously ex- pelled. Of the Fifth Species of Respiration. Birds. —Here we have a contracting and dilating thorax, with ribs and sternum. The cavity of the chest is not divided by a diaphragm, but is common to the whole digestive organs as well as the lungs; or, as is said, they are " all chest and no belly." They differ from all other animals in this respect, that the lungs do not hang in the cavity of the trunk as unat- tached sacs, but are attached in the form of flattened masses, of spongy, bright red, cellular texture, to the posterior side of the thorax, reaching to the pelvis. They have vesicles or air bags extending through the whole body ; and the cancellated structure of their bones is connected with the true lungs ; so that if we tie the trachea and amputate the wing, leaving the stump of the bone exposed, the bird can inspire and expire through the humerus. In the same manner that the diffusion of air through all parts of the body in insects makes the highest extent of respiration in invertebrata, so also is it with birds among the vertebrata. The sternum and ribs, together with the immoveable range of dorsal vertebrae, all con- tribute to dilate and narrow the thorax, after the manner of a bellows movement. This di- latation and contraction draws the air through the true lungs, which never move, and imme- diately the air cells are expanded. By this means two conditions are obtained; the air is drawn through the lungs for aeration ; and the air filling the cancellated structure, renders the bird specifically lighter. The high flying rapacious bird can thus by a respiratory movement attenuate the air in his body, when soaring in the atmosphere, and again at pleasure condense it in every inter- stice of his frame, when he drops like a can- non ball, to pounce on his pre) ; but imme- diately before seizing it, again he attenu- ates the airwithin him to break his fall ; o'her- wise he would be dashed to pieces upon the pointed crag, and die along with his victim. This beautiful provision is wholly due to his respiratory movement, at one time acting as a condensing, and at another time as an exhausting syringe. Of the Sixth Species of Respiration. Mam- malia.—In this class we first meet with a perfect muscular septum (diaphragm) forming the two cavities of the trunk ; the one for the lungs, and the other for the abdominal viscera. All animals which have a diaphragm, maintain respiration in a manner similar to each other ; for, indeed, it appears that the ouly use of this muscle is to maintain a movement of air —that unceasing pumping to and fro of inspi- ration and expiration. Their respiration, or at least their inspiration, is purely of the vacuum order. The diaphragm is the chief muscle of ordi- nary breathing. It can act with great power, protruding the viscera, by its descent, at each ordinary inspiration. This is strikingly seen in animals recumbent and at rest, as in the cow, horse, goat, dog, &c, when it ap- pears as if the animal was breathing with its abdomen. The ribs likewise in some degree maintain respiration in the lower mammiferous animals, particularly in disease. For instance, the respiration of the horse or dog, when the lung is emphysematous, or what is familiarly termed " broken-winded," is costal, and at such times the respiratory action of the ribs may be beautifully seen. It is most probable that in mammalian re- spiration we have the highest order of accom- modation for peculiar respiration, according to the condition of the animal ; i.e. an instinc- tive power to respire by different parts of the thoracic cavity, according to the needs of the animal, whether modified by health or disease. Nearly two hundred years ago, Lower changed the respiratory movements of the dog from diaphragmatic to costal, by paralysing the diaphragm through the medium of the phrenic nerve. {Phil. TV. Abr., vol. i. p. 179.) The respiration of mammalia is the bellows action — inflation of the lungs by expansion of the thorax, or inspiration by vacuum, and ex- piration by propulsion. The projectile force in the respiration of mammalia is nearly all due to mere elastic contractility ; i. e. ordinary expirations are produced by the elasticity of the lungs and ribs, returning backwards, or collapsing, after their distension by the inspiratory muscles. This nieredead and involuntary force performs one half of our respiration. Man is not distinguished either by the force, extent, or complexity of his respiratory move- ments ; he is exceeded in all these particulars by inferior animals. The roar of the lion gives the idea of an overwhelming expiratory power ; nor are his lungs less complicated ; anil the vibration of thousands of cilia, pro- moting currents around the monad, is more complex than the simple respiratory thoracic action of mammalia. The most striking dif- ference is that produced by mental influence, which appears to command the most delicate modifications of this movement, so indicativeTHORAX. 1022 of the passions of his mind, while in the lower animals we see none of these. Of the Thorax in Man. Anatomy of the framework of the Thorax.—A portion of the spine, the ribs, the sternum, together with numerous muscles, form the wall of the human thorax. The framework of bones is so ar- ranged as to admit of free mobility in various directions, so as to increase or diminish the cubic capacity of the thoracic cavity. Of theDorsal Vertebrce.—That portion of the spine which enters into the composition of the thorax consists of the dorsal vertebra;, which are 12 in number, intermediate in size and position, between the cervical and the lumbar vertebrae. They form the main pillar of support for the whole respiratory apparatus —the great fixed point for the chief respira- tory muscles to act against or draw upon. Their general appearance is that of increasing in size from above downwards ; but when carefully examined, they are as two cones, the apices of which touch at about the fourth or fifth vertebra, from which point, in either direction, they increase in their dimensions ; their breadth laterally exceeds their depth from before backwards. Their bodies are large and project deeply into the cavity of the tho- rax, diminishing greatly the antero-posterior diameter of the chest. Out of twenty cases, the average projection is 2§ of an inch, leaving little more than 4 inches for the heart and great blood-vessels. A deep sulcus is thus formed, which if a cast be taken of the cavity of the thorax, is very striking. In phthisis pulmonalis, the space between the bodies of these verte- bras and the sternum is sometimes less than one inch ! When the thorax changes its form by disease, this centre pillar is liable to wedge in or jam up the thoracic organs against the walls of the chest. The vertebrae are connected to each other by ligaments, and jointed beautifully into each other, so as collectively to admit of extensive motion, while there is but little movement between any two vertebrae. Of the bonds of union, the most remarkable are the inter-vertebral disks (ligamcnta inter- vertebralia—Weitbr.)—composed of fibro-car- tilage, and placed between the bodies of the vertebrae, each disk serving to unite two vertebrae, and yet to permit a motion in any direction, yielding on that side towards which the column inclines, while on the contrary side it expands with the increasing intervertebral space. This substance is to the brain what the cushion or " buffer " between each railway carriage is to the traveller; it breaks a sud- den jar from being transmitted from carriage to carriage. So does this intervertebral sub- stance soften down any sudden jerk received at the lower extremity of the spine, preventing its being transmitted to the brain in the varied actions of walking, running, and leaping. Of the Sternum (os pectoris : Xiphoidcs), so named from artpvor, the breast: is a kind of flattened bone, symmetrical in shape, which occupies the anterior and middle part of the thorax. It is supported by the ribs on either side ; it is broadest at its upper part, and then narrowed; it widens again, and finally becomes compressed and narrow where it joins the ensiform cartilage. (Fig. 6G0, e.) Its direction is oblique from above down- wards and forwards. This, with the curva- ture backwards of the spine opposite to it, increases the antero-posterior diameter of the thorax, as may be seen in a lateral view of a cast of the thoracic cavity. The length of the sternum, which is pro- portionably smaller in the female than the male, varies from 5 to 7i inches. At the upper part its breadth is from 1| to 2 inches. Its thickness above is about 6 lines ; at its lowest part it is much thinner, never exceed- ing three lines. The ancients compared the sternum to the sword of a gladiator ; and hence have arisen the denominations given to its various parts : as the handle (manubrium), the body (macro), the point, or xiphoid appendix, (ensiformis) ; but the last mention- ed part now only retains the designation grounded on this circumstance. This division of the bone into three parts has been retained by some modern anatomists, who describe the three pieces of the sternum separately, as so many distinct bones; we shall only adhere to this in speaking of the development of the bone. In anatomical language it is said, the ster- num presents two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. Of the anterior or cutaneous surface of the Sternum. — This is subcutaneous, slightly con- vex and affords attachment to the aponeurosis of the pectoralis major and the sterno-cleido- mastoid muscles. It presents three or four trans- verse projecting lines, which are traces of the original division of the bone into five pieces. The union between the 1st and 2nd pieces cor- responds to the insertion of the 2nd costal car- tilage, and is frequently cartilaginous even in the adult age. The line which marks the union of the first two pieces of the bone is the most remarkable : it causes a projection of variable size in different individuals, which has been sometimes mistaken for a fracture or exos- tosis. At the lower part we sometimes find a foramen ; sometimes in place of the foramen there is a considerable aperture, to which much importance has been attached, as afford- ing a proof of the primitive separation of the bone in the median line. (Fig. C60. d.) The existence of this opening explains how puru- lent matter deposited behind the sternum may, in certain cases, make its way outwards without any absorption of the bone. This bone is covered by a strong interlacement of very numerous aponeurotic fibres. Of the posterior (mediastinal or cardiac) sur- face.—This is slightly concave, and parallel in direction to the anterior surface. The con- cavity is directed downwards and backwards, towards the cavity of the thorax, and gives attachment superiorly to the sterno-hi/oideus and sterno-thuroidcus muscles, inferiorly to the triangularis sterni.THORAX. 1023 Along the middle line, this concavity cor- responds with the interval left by the diverg- ence of the two pleurae (anterior mediasti- num). In the young subject, transverse lines are seen corresponding to those which occupy the anterior surface ; all of these, except the two between the first and second pieces of the bone, are effaced at a more advanced age. This surface is in relation with many organs contained in the chest, and especially the heart, in front of which the sternum forms a kind of shield. This is exemplified, as al- ready noticed, in the frog, which is provided with a sternum, though it has no ribs. At the lower part of the sternum are many nutritient foramina. Of the borders of the Sternum. — These are thick and marked at each side by seven an- gular depressions for the reception of the cartilages of the first seven ribs, which gives this bone a notched and seriated appear- ance. These angular cavities are separated from each other by semilunar notches, which are longer above than below, where the facettes closely approach each other. The uppermost of these seven cavities is shallow, triangular, and at an early age becomes ingrained with the cartilage of the first rib ; those which follow are deeper, angular, and situated at the ex- tremities of each of the transverse lines. When examined in the dried specimen, they appear more angular and deeper in proportion to the youth of the subject. Of the clavicular extremity.—This is slightly convex, and is the broadest and thickest part of the whole bone. It is slightly excavated from side to side, and presents at each corner a depression for the reception of the sternal end of the clavicle, which bears the name fourchette; this is surrounded with irregula- rities for the insertion of ligaments. It fre- quently happens that the two clavicular arti- culations are not at the same height ; a fact which was noticed by Morgagni, and which Cruveilhier attributes to the unequal wearing of the two articular surfaces. We have once seen the clavicular articulation so low as to unite with the first costal cartilage. Of the inferior extremity of the Sternum.— This is formed by the xiphoid appendix ; or ensiform cartilage, for it often remains cartilaginous to adult age. In length, shape, and direction, it presents nume- rous varieties ; it is frequently bifid, some- times pierced by a foramen, and is occasion- ally bent forwards, or to one side, and in certain cases much depressed : its summit gives attachment to an aponeurotic structure, called the linea alba; behind, it indirectly corresponds with the stomach, which rests upon it when the body is placed in a prone position. Connections. — The sternum articulates with fourteen ribs through the medium of their cartilages, and more directly with the two cla- vicles. Structure of the Sternum. — This bone con- sists of two very thin compact lamina?, with an intervening cancellated structure, the cells of which are very large and have very delicate parietes. ,It is one of the most spongy bones of the body, and it is more than probable that to this circumstance the frequency of disease in it may be attributed. Absorption of this bone and great displace- ment by bending inwards is very common, particularly in women who wear tight stays. Under such circumstances, or by disease, we have witnessed the sternum so depressed in- wards that the depth, including all the thoracic integuments from the spinous processes of the dorsal vertebra? to the anterior surface of this bone, did not exceed three inches, in- stead of from seven to nine inches. Of the Development or Ossification of the Sternum. — As far as the middle of fcetal life or a little later, the sternum is altogether cartilaginous,as represented aXa,fig 660. This Fig. GGO. bone is one of the slowest in its ossification ; it exhibits no bony points or centres of os- sification up to the sixth month of foetal life. It is also of all bones the one in which the phenomena of ossification proceed with the least regularity. After the sixth month of fcetal life, ossification begins with the for- mation of osseous granules in the middle of the intervals between the points at which the cartilages of the ribs are connected. " There are five of these granules for the sternum, exclusive of the ensiform appendage, and they form as many pieces (e, fig. 660.). The process of ossification makes its appear- ance in the first between the fifth and sixth mouths; and, soon following in the second and third, it reaches the fourth at the end of foetal life. The osseous centre of the last varies considerably in the time of its appearance. It may be found soon after birth, and may not be visible for a considerable time (one or two years) after that period." " In many cases, one or more of the divi- sions of the sternum are formed from more nuclei than one, and there are peculiarities with respect to the number and position of these additional granules which require notice." Ossification of the 1st piece.— This some- times presents a single nucleus (fig. 660,6 1.), rounded and transversely strong ; sometimes it presents two nuclei, and in this case theyTHORAX. 1024 may be either placed one above the other, or side by side. In the former case the up- permost nucleus is the larger ; in the latter, both may be symmetrical and of equal size, or what is more common, they may be of un- equal magnitude. It may occasionally present more than two osseous points. Albinus found three in one subject, and four in another.* Mr.Quain has a preparation in Uni- versity College, where the very unusual num- ber of six {Jig. 660. c. V.) are to be seen. In this case, where there is a plurality of osseous points, the largest are generally situated alone; exceptions to this rule are very rare. Ossification of the body, or the 2nd, 3rd, Uh, and oth pieces. — The osseous nuclei which enter into the composition of the body of the sternum have generally a rounded form when they are single, and are situated in the middle line; where they are in pairs or are placed laterally, they are more elongated, but smaller, and appear to represent only the half of one of the single nodules. The second piece has not often more than a single granule (b. 2, c. 2'.), but the rest are frequently formed from two nuclei, which are placed laterally to one another (c 3', 4'.), and not vertically as occurs in the first piece. These different osseous points are always so arranged as to be situated between two costo-sternal articulations, so that a portion of the sternum is developed in each of the intervals comprised between the ribs. The last piece is the only exception, being com- mon to the articulation of the 6th and 7th ribs. There are, therefore, four primitive pieces of the body of the sternum (b. 1, 2, 3, 4.), and each of these is sometimes formed by one point of ossification; at other times by two lateral points. The first piece may be formed of one or many ossific points, which may be arranged vertically as well as laterally To the centres of ossification here described, M. Brechet f has added two small epi-sternal granules, whose position is sufficiently shown by the indication of them, Jig. 660. at d**. They occur only at rather advanced periods of life, but they do not appear to be constant. Union of the points of ossification of the body of the Sternum.—In considering the union of the different parts which compose the body of the sternum, it is necessary to make a distinc- tion between the lateral conjunction—that is, the union of the osseous points which are situated on each side of the median line— and the vertical conjunction, or the union of the pieces of the sternum properly so called. The lateral conjunction, or the union of these osseous germs, which form a pair in the same interval, always precedes the vertical conjunc- tion. The vertical conjunction, or the union of the different pieces of the body of the sternum * Cruveilhier, Descrip. Anat. 8vo. 1840. Lond. P- 87. . _ t Recherches sur Differentes Pieces du Sque- lette des Animaux Verte'bre's, &c. in " Annates des Sciences Naturelles." 2de Serie, t. 10. (Zootegie) p. 91. together, commences with the two inferior portions. After this union, the body of the bone consists only of three parts. The 2nd piece then unites with the lower: the sternal foramen is formed sometimes at the junction of these last mentioned parts, sometimes at the place where the two lateral points of the 4th and of the 3rd portions of the body are united. If the interruption to the progress of ossification should occur at the point where the lateral parts of two sternal pieces would meet, the foramen is likely to have con- siderable size ; for it may be the result of an "arrest of development" proceeding from four centres each constituting a part. (Fig.660. d.) The union of the divisions of the body of the sternum takes place precisely in the inverse order of their appearance In fact the appearance of the osseous points proceeds from above downwards, while their union proceeds from below upwards : a fact which verifies the assertion, that the order of development of osseous points is not always correlative to the order of junction. The lowest or 5th piece is joined to the 4th soon after puberty; the 4th and the 3rd are united, between 20 and 30 years of age; and the body of the sternum is usually not completed by the junction of the 3rd piece to the 2nd before 35 or 40 years. Lastly, the 1st division does not in general join the rest of the sternum at any period ; but should its union happen to take place, it is only to be met with in advanced age. Of the ossification of the appendix.—This is generally accomplished by one nodule. Some- times there are two ; and then they are rarely symmetrical. The process commences in the upper part of the cartilage, and very rarely extends through the whole. The time of ap- pearance of the osseous point is extremely variable. Sometimes it is visible towards the 3rd or 4th year; sometimes not until the 12th or even the 18tb year; according to the observation of Beclard, between the 2nd and 18th years. From the 40th to the 50th year, and some- times later, the appendix becomes united to the body of the sternum. From the varieties of ossification or development of the sternum, it will be evident that it is impossible to assign to it a limited number of osseous points. Of the Ribs.— The ribs (Cosfce from cus- todcs *) extend from the dorsal portion of the vertebral column to the sternum, form- ing arches which correspond to the lateral segments of the chest. About one sixth of the ribs are cartilaginous, and the rest os- seous. The osseous portion is the rib pro- perly so called ; the cartilaginous portion is named the costal cartilage. The ribs are 24 in number, 12 on each side ; but cases occasionally occur in which this number is augmented by the addition * As if they were guardians of those principal organs of the animal machine, the heart and lungs. —Munro: The Anatomy of the Human Bones, p. 234. Edingb. 1726.1025 THORAX. oF a pair of cervical or lumbar ribs: in this case the supernumerary ribs are formed from the anterior parts of the transverse processes of either the seventh cervical or first lumbar vertebra ; which affords a strong proof of the analogy existing between a transverse process and a rib. Sometimes the usual number is diminished to 22 : this is more rarely the case. When this occurs, we sometimes find two adjacent ribs united throughout their entire length. Sometimes the first rib is in a rudimentary state, being properly formed posteriorly, but having its an- terior extremity lost among the muscles, or united to the 2nd rib. Mr. Quain has lately seen an instance in which this diminution of the number of the ribs was accompanied with the absence of a dorsal vertebra.* Classification of the ribs.— The ribs are nu- merically designated 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on, counting from above downwards. In the living or in the undissected subject it is easier to count the ribs from below upwards. The seven superior ribs are united by means of their own cartilaginous prolongations (fig. 661. b, c, d, e,f, g, and h ; and/g. 662.) Fig. 661. to the sternum, and are called true ribs or sternal ribs, or vertebrosternal ribs; the re- maining five are not so immediately prolonged to the sternum, and are denominated fake ribs, or asternal ribs, or vertebral ribs. We think it would be more judicious to classify them otherwise, and consider the five superior ribs as sternal, true, or thoracic ribs; the five next inferior, as diaphragmatic ribs ; the two last, being floating or false ribs. Be- cause, the first five especially encompass the cavity of the thorax ; the five next a portion only of this space, together with a large por- tion of the abdominal viscera ; and, lastly, be- cause the two last do not touch the sternum through the medium of any cartilage. The transverse shade {Jig. 682.) represents the arch * Elements of Anatomy l>y Mr. Quain and W. Sharpey, M. D. London, 8vo. 1843, p. 105. VOL. IV, of the diaphragm, or the floor of the thorax. Every rib articulates with the dorsal vertebrae ; Fig. 662. Position of the ribs and spine after deep expiration. the spine is their fixed point, or centre of motion, — the main pillar upon which they act. The superior ten ribs articulate through the medium of cartilages, the first seven through the medium of their own, the next three through that of those of their superior neighbours, {fig. 661.) with the sternum. The ribs have certain general characters which distinguish them from all other bones; and likewise certain proper or special charac- ters, by which one is known from another. I. Of the general characters of the ribs.—The ribs resemble flattened bony hoops, varying in breadth from *4 to '7 of an inch, and from 'I to '4 of an inch in thickness; they once at- tain a maximum, and twice a minimum length (fig- 662.) Theyareof averyirregularshape. Their arch or curve is neither uniform relatively to each other, nor yet relatively to itself at different parts of the bone ; moreover they are twisted in different degrees upon themselves so that the two extremities of the same bone point in different directions, and cannot simulta- neously touch an horizontal surface. Surfaces.—These bones present two sur- faces : an external or cutaneous surface, which is convex and smooth ; and an internal or pul- monary surface, which is concave and likewise smooth. The anterior end is comparatively flat, the posterior is more cylindrical and truncated, and is rough, particularly at the extremity. Borders. — The ribs have two borders, the one superior, and the other inferior. The superior border is smooth and rounded, and gives attachment to the intercostal muscles ; 3 u1026 THORAX. the inferior border is more thin and sharp, particularly in the middle third, or body, of the bone. This thin or blade-like appearance is caused by a groove on its inner aspect termed sulcus costalis, which is commonly said to be for the lodgment of the intercostal vessels : this border also gives attachment to the intercostal muscles. The borders are irregular in their direction corresponding with the shape of the rib; which we shall presently notice. Fig. 663. a Fourth rib. Extremities. — (a) Posterior or vertebral extremity, {fig. 663. c).— This is rougher and somewhat thicker than the other parts of the rib, and is hence denominated its head (capitulum costa;). It presents, except in in- stances to be presently stated two articular facets, a superior and an inferior one, sepa- rated by a well-defined ridge. Each of these facets articulates with a corresponding small surface on the bodies of two vertebrae, the ridge just mentioned corresponding with the intervertebral substance. The head of the rib is supported by a narrow round part, somewhat constricted — the neck { fig. 663. /). This is flattened from before backwards and is the weakest part of the bone. Behind the neck there are some inequalities, which correspond to the trans- verse process of the dorsal vertebra below. Externally to the neck is an eminence known as the tubercle of the rib (tuberos- ity, tuberculum costce, fig. 663. g), which is smooth in one part for its articulation with the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebra; to which the head is connected, and rough in the other, which is posterior, and in some ribs superior to the above, for the inser- tion of the posterior costo-transverse liga- ment. The tubercles are most prominent in the four or five superior ribs. Anterior to the tubercle the rib suddenly bends forwards, leaving this part the most convex, making what is termed its angle, {fig. 663. //) The interval which separates the tuberosity from the angle, is the thickest, roundest, and strongest part of the bone. (b) Anterior, or sternal extremity {fig. 663. (•/). •—■ The anterior extremity of the ribs is broad, flat, and deeply hollowed out at its tip into an oval pit, into which is implanted the costal cartilage. This extremity of the rib is broader and thicker than it is an inch more posteriori}'. Body. — This may be described as that part intervening between the angle and the anterior extremity. We have stated that the posterior end is more round than the anterior ; the body, therefore, may be considered as of a transition form, passing from the cylindrical to the flat, blade-like, shape as it approaches towards the sternum. Curve. — The curve which the ribs follow is very irregular, and therefore not easy to describe. No doubt they are of the form best adapted to admit of a great increase of thoracic capacity at the expense of a remark- ably small movement. They appear to encom- pass the thorax in a somewhat spiral manner (see dark lines figs. 682 and 683.) ; to accom- plish which they have three curves, one the common general arch or bend of the bone ; the others the twist of the edges near the extremities termed the curve of torsion. (A) Arch or general bend of the ribs. — This is the most remarkable feature of a rib. What- ever be the curve of the 1st rib, it may be said that each inferior rib describes a curve " one size" larger ; so that one rib can be laid close within the other, like hoops of gradually increasing sizes. Two distinct curves will then be seen. It will be ob- served that the part extending between the head and the angle describes a larger cir- cle than the angle itself, which as the name im- plies, is the most acute turn in the bone. More anterior to this, the curve becomes remarkably large ; which Haller has so ex- pressively described as representing the tan- gent to the posterior curve. In connexion with the general curve of the rib should be noticed two linear measurements, viz., the chord and the versed sine. In fig. 604. is given Fig. 664. B 1> A C Second rib. the 2nd rib ; the line a b is the chord, and d c the versed sine, or a line extending from the chord to the most prominent part of the bend of the bone. The general curve regulates the length of the versed sine. This curve of the rib gives the sides of the chest a power of enlarging,— a lateral mobility, — according to the length of the versed sine, and quite distinct from the antero-posterior enlargement, which is according to the length of the chord. The ribs do not increase the lateral dimensions of the thorax by abduction, but solely by their rotation upon the line a b (B) Curves of torsion of the ribs.—If we take1027 THORAX. 3 u 2 the 7th rib and place it on a table it will be observed that the extremities cannot simul- taneously rest upon one plane, because it is twisted upon itself. This is due to what is called the curve of torsion. The rib is twisted at each end ; hence a posterior and an ante- rior torsion. The posterior torsion is most conspicuous, and is therefore more commonly noticed. (a) Posterior torsion. — This torsion is marked at the angle of the rib (h,Jig. CG3.), particularly upon the convex surface, by an oblique line or a series of faint lines directed from above downwards and forwards. Like other features of the ribs, it passes through gradations, being scarcely perceptible in the 2nd rib, more so in the 3rd, and in- creasing to the maximum in the 8th, in the 9th and 10th it quickly decreases, until it is lost in the 11th and 12th. The greater the torsion the more distinct is the angle ; where the angle is rudimentary the torsion is imper- ceptible, as in the 11th and 12th ribs. The degrees of this torsion as it passes through the ribs are most distinctly seen by having the ribs separate, and placing them on a flat surface with their superior edge upper- most, arranging them so that they do not quite touch each other, when the heads of the dif- ferent ribs will stand up at different heights from the table, forming a somewhat regular wave. This is solely produced by this posterior torsion. (b) Anterior torsion. — Near the anterior extremity, on the convex surface, in well- developed ribs, we observe an oblique line analogous to that at the angle of the rib, but much less distinctly marked. This line may be considered as forming the anterior angle and corresponding torsion of the ribs, which, like the posterior, is intended for more favour- able muscular insertions. Although the anterior angle is comparatively feebly marked, the anterior torsion of the ribs is as well defined as the posterior torsion. It will be seen in Jig. 667, that while the posterior extremity of the rib curls vpwards, the an- terior extremity curls downwards. In like manner as we notice the posterior torsion by placing the separate ribs on a table, so may the anterior torsion be as strikingly seen, taking care to place the ribs upon their superior edge so that the sharp inferior edge is turned upwards. The anterior ends will be seen to stand up in different degrees from the table according to their torsion, commenc- ing with the 3rd or 4th and terminating with the 10th rib. Articulations of the ribs. — The ribs are articulated behind with the dorsal vertebras, and in front with the sternum through the medium of the costal cartilages. This has already been noticed under Extremities of the ribs. Position of the ribs. — The ribs are arranged more or less obliquely, — about midway between the perpendicular and horizontal (Jigs. CG2. and G83.) ; — and they somewhat diverge from each other as they approach the sternum.(Jigs. 662. 680. and 681.) Not one of them is horizontal, though commonly re- presented as if they were. Their position is given injig. 662. This is important to remem- ber, because we shall see that costal breathing altogether depends upon their obliquity. Structure. — The compact and spongy sub- stances are so distributed throughout the whole length of the ribs that they possess a certain degree of flexibility, with great power of resistance. In young subjects the compact substance is in excess ; in the aged, and in certain diseases, the opposite is the case; hence the extreme fragility of these bones, which are then broken by the least effort. Development. — The ribs are amongst the earliest developed bones, ossification com- mencing in them even somewhat before it has made its appearance in the vertebra?. The deposition of osseous matter extends rapidly throughout them. Each rib (with exceptions to be noticed) is formed from one principal piece ; and two epiphyses. Of these two epiphyses, one forms the head of the rib, and the other the tubercle : their ossification commences between the sixteenth and twentieth years of age ; and they are united to the rest of the bone a few years after, — about the twenty-fifth year. II. Special characters of different ribs.—The differential characters of the ribs, when mi- nutely examined, are well marked ; for, strictly speaking, no two ribs on the same side are of the same shape and dimensions. Although the difference is very small between two con- tiguous ribs, as, for instance, between the cen- tral ribs, i. c. between the 6th, 7th, and 8th, yet it is very conspicuous between those of the top compared with those of the bottom of the thorax. Whatever be the peculiarity under examination, we find it most developed in the 6th or 7th rib; and below this it becomes less and less marked, until, in the 12th rib, it appears rudimentary. In fact, the 12th rib may be considered little more than a prolonged transverse process; but not so with the 1st rib, which possesses all the marks and uses necessary to the character of a rib. The ribs differ in their length, and in their chord and versed-sine measurements, and consequently in the area of thorax which they encompass. The thoracic dimensions vary considerably in different men and in the two sexes; yet the relative measurements and weight of the ribs will be found useful to our comprehending more perfectly the res- piratory movements. These relative measurememts are from a well-formed male thorax. The area-measure- ment is calculated from an internal cast of the thorax, cut up slice by slice through each intercostal space. These slices were traced upon paper and measured, giving the absolute area of thoracic cavity encompassed by each pair of ribs, their cartilages, and the sternum.

The perpendicular lines represent the ribs; and the curves the characters re- ferred to. By a general view it will be seen that all the lines curve upwards, and are at their highest at about from the 5th to the 9th rib. We shall not treat of particular ribs, but of certain characteristics as they run through the ribs. A knowledge of their shape is ne- cessary to comprehending the respiratory movements in diagnosing thoracic disease. I, Length. — The length of a rib may be taken in three ways, — its absolute length, chord length, and versed-sine length. (a) Absolute length.—In the length from the anterior to the posterior extremity, (a c b, fig. 664.) the 12th rib is the shortest. The 11th rib is nearly double the length of the 12th rib ; likewise the 2nd rib is nearly double the length of the 1st rib ; therefore the 1st and 2nd, and the 11th and 12th differ more re- markably in their length than do any of the other ribs. The length (curve a, fig. 665.) suddenly increases up to the 4th rib ; and then the difference is trifling to the 8th rib ; after this the shortening is as rapid as in the four superior ribs. (b) Chord length. —The dotted line b,fig. 665, represents this measurement. This length from tip to tip (a b, fig. 664.) of the rib is the chief modifier of the different apparent mobility of particular ribs. If we allow the range of costal movement to be the same in each rib, while each succeeding rib increases in its chord length, the apparent mobility in different ribs will increase exactly as their chord measurement increases. If a rib be three inches long, and if its free extremity by a given movement passes through one inch of space, the free extremity of a rib six inches long will, with the same absolute movement, pass through two inches. The chord length is an important element in modifying thoracic capacity. It is in this measurement that the 1st rib is the shortest and nearly one half the length of the 2nd rib, — as 2* is to 3-75. (Table A.) The chord length (line b, fig. 665, com- pare with line a,) increases and decreases less abruptly than that of the absolute length. If we were to admit that all the ribs at their fulcra possessed the same extent of mo- tion, still the antero-posterior length of the thorax would be unequally increased, and that exactly in relation to the chord measurement; Fig. 665. Absolute length a Chord ^ "Versed sine Area - Weight and hence the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs advances most, somewhat representing the would advance most. It is a fact that in deep curve line b,fig. 665. inspiration the lower part of the sternum (c) Versed Sine Length (d c, fig. 664.) —THORAX. 1029 3 U 3 As the chord length is to the antero-posterior movement, so is this measurement to the lateral movement of the thorax. This is the most uniform measurement in the ribs. If the 1st rib be 1-75, the 2nd rib is to that as 3; and from this rib to the 9th rib, the versed sine never exceeds 3'5 ; hence the curve c, Jig. 665. is more horizontal than any of the other curves. So likewise it will be found that the lateral enlargement of the thorax in deep breathing is more uniform than the antero-posterior enlargement. (See dotted line, Jiqs. 711, 712. compared with dotted line, Jigs. 713, 714.) The space gained by the ribs rotating must be strictly in relation to the length between the deepest part of the arch and the chord line, (d c, fig. 664.) This mea- surement is greatest relatively in the 2nd rib, and absolutely smallest in the 12th rib, the curve here being very small. The versed sine of the ribs corresponds with the great curve: if a rib were not curved at all, there would be no versed sine. The versed sine does not increase after the 4th rib; and the curvature of the first four ribs forms smaller circles than the rest. The 5th and 6th ribs, although rapidly increasing in absolute length (see Table A.), yet present nearly the same versed sine; and while the chord line increases up to the 9th rib, from the 6th to the 9th the versed sine decreases, showing that the circle or arch of the rib becomes larger as we descend, until the 12th rib, which describes the greatest curve and the shortest versed sine. In fact there is little difference in the versed sine length from the 3rd to the 10th rib, as described by the double line c,Jig. 665. This difference of arching of the ribs constitutes the conical form of the thorax, the smaller circles being at the apex, and the larger at the base of the cavity. (2) Weight. — The ribs increase not only in their various measurements but also in their weight up to the 7th or 8th where they attain their maximum development. The faint con- tinuous curve, c, fig. 665. is the line of the relative weight. (3) Torsion of the ribs (special diaraclcrsy. — SVe have already mentioned that the ribs have two torsions, an anterior and a pos- rerior. No rib is entirely free from this twist. It is incorrect to believe that the 1st rib is without any torsion, and therefore that the whole rib in its length cau touch the same plane. In fact the 1st rib may in one sense be looked upon as the most twisted of all the set, inasmuch as the flat sides which are internal and external in other ribs are in this rib inferior and superior. Like other features, the degree of torsion in the different ribs is progressive towards a maximum, and then towards a minimum. The 2nd, 11th, and 12th ribs are most devoid of torsion. In the last two ribs the torsion ap- pears less than it really is, because of their shortness and the large circle which they de- scribe. The two torsions in each rib are always in contrary directions, except in the 2nd rib, where they are both downwards, but the tor- sion is here very slight. In the 1st rib, as in the ten inferior ribs, they are in contrary di- rections to each other, so that its two ends cannot touch the same plane at the same time ; but its anterior and posterior torsions are respectively contrary to those of the ten in- ferior ribs ; its posterior torsion being, like that of the second rib, downwards, and its an- terior upwards. The relative torsion of the ribs may be ex- pressed by giving the respective elevations of each extremity from the plane upon which they rest. Thus the posterior torsion is seen when the rib rests upon its inferior edge, and the anterior torsion when it rests upon its su- perior edge. In this way the following table is calculated. Table B. — Torsions of the Ribs. Ribs. Posterior End Torsion Upwards. Anterior End Torsion Downwards. 1 6-0* 5-0f 2 2-5* 3-0 3 3-0 3-0 4 12-5 4-25 5 13-0 12-0 6 12-25 21-5 7 18-00 29-5 8 21-25 28-0 9 21-25 25-0 10 9-50 17-5 11 1-50 5-5 12 2-00 45 If the posterior twist of the ribs upwards be expressed conjointly as 114, the anterior tor- sion downwards is 153 ; therefore the anterior torsion is greater than the posterior. The torsions in the 2nd, 3rd, 11th, and 12th are the least; and they are the greatest in the 7th, 8th, and 9th ribs. Moreover as the tor- sion increases at one extremity of the rib, for the most part it increases at the other like- wise. The ribs of some persons are much less twisted than those of others. This is parti- cularly the case in young subjects before the age of puberty. In infants the torsions are imperceptible ; therefore they increase as we advance to maturity. These torsions afford more favourable traction for the muscles. Where the respiratory movement is most ap- parent, as from the 4th to the 9th rib, the torsion is highest. I The posterior torsion gives the ribs, when placed in their natural position, a very oblique direction with reference to the spine. This is very important to remember; for the more oblique, the more favourable are they for mo- bility or for increasing the thoracic cavity. For the same reason the anterior torsion, being in a contrary direction to the posterior, increases still more the obliquity of the rib with refer- * Downwards. { Upwards.1030 THORAX. ence to the spine. But the relation of these torsions to the spine are different: the pos- terior torsion is relative to the spine late- rally, while the anterior torbion relates to the spine more in the antero-posterior direc- tion: they both conspire to increase the obli- quity of the rib in one given direction,—from above downwards. The torsion of the 1st rib, we have noticed, is directed in a contrary direction to that of other ribs ; and we have observed that the presence of torsion in general favours muscular traction: but the 1st rib is an exception to this; here the torsion exists only between its two chief articulating pro- cesses, — the head and the tubercle : in the other ribs the torsion is between the tu- bercle and the body of the bone. The pos- terior torsion of the 1st rib appears to be merely destined to afford the head a more complete attachment to the body of the one vertebra (the 1st dorsal) to which that rib is fixed. A posterior torsion, in this short rib, is not needed for muscular traction, be- cause here the scaleni are placed in the most favourable position — nearly at an angle of 90° with reference to the body of the bone in question, while their other insertion into the cervical vertebra; facilitates the most ex- tensive and favourable means for its mobility, independently of any favouring twist in the rib for that purpose. (4) Surfaces (special differences). — The thorax being conical, or somewhat barrel- shaped, it follows that the surfaces of the ribs, like the hoops of a very spherical barrel, must gradually change their direc- tion ; thus the surfaces of the 1st rib are nearly superior and inferior, this bone forming the lid to the thorax, while the surfaces of the 6th or 7th rib are external and internal, and as we proceed downwards to the 10th, 11th, and 12th ribs, the surfaces are again slightly tending towards a superior and inferior po- sition, so that the internal surfaces of the 1st and 12th ribs are directed somewhat towards each other. The body of the rib, or that part which covers the lung laterally, and the anterior and posterior extremities, have also their surfaces inclined in different directions. Thus, take a perfect rib, say the 7th, laterally to the thorax the two surfaces are internal and external, while at the anterior end they are directed — external surface, forwards and downwards ; internal surface, upwards and backwards ; — at the posterior end, — external surface, upwards and backwards; internal surface, downwards and forwards. This is produced by their respective torsions. In some of the lower animals the ribs overlap each other like the tiles of a house; this sometimes threatens in man, particularly in diseases of the spine (Jig. 666.), when they closely approach each other. (5) Specific differences of the extremities of the ribs. — The greatest difference is in the posterior end of the rib. The anterior pre- senting little difference. (a) Anterior extremity.— These are all hol- lowed out for their cartilage. As the ribs become more perfectly developed, for in- stance, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th, the an- terior extremity is broader, but not more deeply hollowed out than some of the other ribs, which are less perfectly developed, as in the 2nd and 3rd, or 11th ribs. This extremity is most pointed in the 12th rib. Fig. 666. Relation of the ribs to the spine in angular curvature. (b) Posterior extremity. — The posterior ex- tremity of the rib is more complicated, and has certain named parts, as the head, neck, tubercle, and angle, all of which become modi- fied as we pass from above downwards. Their differences may briefly be noticed. 1st Of the head.— On the head of the rib, articulating with the vertebrae, a surface or facet is formed. The 1st, the 11th, and the 12th ribs articulate each with the body of one vertebra, and therefore they have one arti- culating surface. All the rest articulate each with the bodies of two vertebra;, and they consequently have two such articulating sur- faces as already described. The head of the 1st rib is relatively larger than that of the others. For the most part, as the ribs in- crease in size, the head likewise increases, so that in the best developed rib the head and its surfaces are most perfectly formed, dege- nerating again to the 12th rib. 2nd Of the neck. — The neck being that part of the rib between the articulation of the rib with the bodies of the vertebra, and that with the transverse process, and these points differing but little in their distance from each other in the dorsal vertebra;, it follows that the absolute length of the neck of the different ribs is nearly the same. The necks of the ribs differ in their thickness, ac- cordingly as their respective ribs increase or diminish in size ; therefore, in the middleTHORAX. 1031 3 u 4 set of ribs, the necks are the thickest and strongest. In the 11th anil 12th ribs, the neck, according to our definition, does not exist. 3rd Of the tubercle. — As the tubercle ar- ticulates with transverse processes, those ribs which have no such articulation have no tu- bercle; this is the case in the 11th and 12th ribs. The tubercles are most prominent in the superior ribs, gradually degenerating, or be- coming less apparent, down to the 10th, where it is almost rudimentary. Ath Of the angle. — In strict anatomical lan- guage, the 1st rib has no angle, but the tu- bercle is very prominent, and gives the bone a very angular appearance, likewise in the 2nd, 3rd, 11th, and 12th ribs the angle is almost imperceptible, whereas it is well marked in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th ribs. (6) Groove {specif'c differences). — The groove is not perceptible in the 1st, 11th, and 12th ribs, but distinct in all the inter- vening ones. The 1st rib has two depressions separated by a tuberosity. The anterior corresponds to the subclavian vein, and the posterior to the artery of the same name. Costal cartilages. — The flexibility and elas- ticity of the ribs is partly owing to their struc- ture, but more especially to the cartilages which prolong them in front, (figs. 661, 662.) There are twelve costal cartilages distinguished numerically, as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, &c. ; they are separated from each other by intervals which are very considerable at the upper part of the thorax, but gradually diminish as we proceed downwards. It is not very un- common to meet with thirteen cartilages on one side, and at other times there are only eleven. Sometimes two cartilages are joined, and so aticulate with the sides of the ster- num ; when there are thirteen cartilages, the supernumerary one generally exists be- tween the 3rd and 4th ribs ; it is thin, and as it were rudimentary; it does not form the continuation of any rib, and terminates insen- sibly in the muscles. The cartilages from the 1st to the 7th articulate immediately with the sternum ; and hence the name of sternal given to ribs with which they are connected. Of the other five cartilages, the last two have no connection with that preceding them ; and from this circumstance, the name floating has been given to the last two ribs. General characters of the costal cartilages. — All the costal cartilages are flattened like the ribs, and precisely resemble in breadth and thickness the bones to which they are attached. The external end is received into a cavity hollowed out in the anterior extre- mity of the rib; their internal or sternal ex- tremity, which is much narrower than the external, is angular and articulates with the corresponding angular surfaces of the ster- num, {fig. 661.) Their anterior or cutaneous surfaces are slightly convex, and covered by the muscles of the anterior region of the trunk, to many of which they give attach- ment. Their posterior or mediastinal surfaces are slightly concave. Their superior and inferior edges bound the intercostal spaces, and give attachment to the intercostal muscles. " They are," says Cruveilhier, " altogether distinct from articular cartilages, and have a peculiar tendency to ossify, this process taking place partly on the surface, and partly from within outwards." Differential characters of the costal carti- lages.— The costal cartilages, like the ribs, increase in length, from the 1st to the 7th, and sometimes the 8th, which in this case articulates with the sternum ; from this they diminish in length to the 12th rib When we recollect the conical shape of the thorax this difference is to be accounted for, and moreover, the osseous parts of the upper ribs terminate anteriorly in a line directed ob- liquely from above downwards and outwards. The sternum is only about half the length of the lateral pectoral space, so that only the first four or five cartilages could join this bone, did not the others turn upwards to reach its sides (fig. 661.), by joining the lower edge of the immediately superior cartilage. The first three cartilages alone, therefore, fol- low the same direction as the long rib to which they articulate. The first cartilage differs from all the others by its shortness, its thickness, and breadth, and its tendency to ossify ; it is often, but not always, continuous with the sternum. The 2nd and 3rd costal cartilages cannot be distinguished from each other, but they differ from the rest in being joined to the sternum at right angles, in not being bent, and in being as broad at their sternal as at their costal extremities. The 4th cartilage becomes bent upwards, after having followed the direction of the rib for a little way. (fig. 661. e.) The length and the curvature of the cartilages of the 5th, 6th, and 7th ribs progressively increase, and across their intercartilaginous spaces they fre- quently touch each other. Their inner ends become successively narrowed so as to cor- respond with the diminishing cavities on the edges of the sternum. The borders of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th costal cartilages ar- ticulate together, and present for this pur- pose articular facets supported by emi- nences. The cartilages of the Sth, <Jth, and 10th ribs gradually diminish in length. Ex- ternally they have the same breadth as the rib, and decrease as they pass inwards, so as to terminate by a pointed extremity, which is applied to the lower edge of the cartilage above. The cartilages of the 11th and 12th ribs are extremely short, particularly that of the 12th, which is only a mere tip to the bone, and seldom exceeds four or five lines in length ; their free extremity loses itself, so to speak, in the substance of the abdominal parietes; so that they are altogether uncon- nected with the other cartilages. Liabiliti/ of the costal cartilages to ossifi/. — The 1st cartilage usually becomes more or less ossified in adult age, and is often anchy- losed to the sternum. After the middle period of life, osseous matter is likewise deposited1032 THORAX. to a greater or less extent in the other car- tilages, and it is apparent in those of the false, later than in those of the true ribs. These observations apply to the male body; for in the female the process of ossification does not affect the cartilages until old age has arrived, and it always affects a comparatively small number of cartilages, even if it should happen to extend beyond the 1st, which com- monly is not the case. Of the ligaments of the ribs, — The liga- ments of the ribs may be divided into three sets, those which connect them, 1st, with the bodies of the vertebra?; 2ndly, with the trans- verse processes, and 3rdly, with the sternum. The rib is connected with the bodies of two vertebrae (excepting those specified above) forming with each a joint lined with synovial membrane, and held in place by the following ligaments: — 1st. With the bodies of Hie vertehrce.— Costo- vertebral ligaments, (lig. capitulorum costaruni). — These consist, 1st, of an anterior ligament ■which connects the head of each rib with the sides of the bodies of the vertebra;. Its fibres, fiat and radiated, are divided into three bundles, of which the middle one passes horizontallyifor- wards upon the corresponding inter-vertebral cartilage, whilst the superior ascends to the body of the vertebra above it, and the inferior descends to that below. From the divergence of its fibres this is usually called the stellate ligament. 2ndly, of an inter-articular ligament, a thin and short band of fibres which passes transversely from the ridge separating the two articular surfaces on the head of the rib, to the inter-vertebral substance, and divides the articulation into two parts, each lined by a separate synovial membrane. This ligament does not exist in the articulation of the 1st, 11th, and ]-2th ribs, and in consequence there is in them but one synovial membrane. 2ndly. With the transverse processes of two ■vertehrce. — The rib at its tubercle forms a joint, lined by synovial membrane, with one transverse process ; and to another (being separated from it by a considerable interval), it is connected by ligamentous structure of some length. The costo-transverse ligaments connect the tubercle and neck of the rib with the transverse processes of the vertebra; ; they are named from their position, posterior, mid- dle, and anterior. a. The posterior costo-transverse ligament— (lig. transversum externum costarum, Weitbr.) consists of a very short, thick fasciculus of fibres, which passes from the posterior surface of the summit of the transverse process, to the rough, inartieular part of the tubercle of the rib. Those of the superior rib ascend, those of the inferior rib somewhat descend. b. The middle, or interosseous costo-trans- verse ligament — consists of a series of very short parallel fibres, which unite the neck of the rib to the anterio surface of the con- tiguous transverse process. These fibres are best seen by removing horizontally a portion of the rib and transverse process, and for- cibly drawing one from the other. c. The anterior, or long costo-transverse ligament — (Jig. transversum internum seu cer- vicis costce internum, Weitbr.), is usually di- vided into two fasciculi of fibres nearly op- posite to one another, and on the same plane. They pass from the neck of the rib obliquely upwards and outwards to the lower, margin of the transverse process next above it. Characters peculiar to certain costo-vertebral articulations. — The articulations of the 1st, 11th, and 12th ribs alone present peculiarities. a. Costo-vertebral articulation of the 1st rib. — The rounded head of the 1st rib is received into a cavity on the side of the body of the ] st dorsal vertebra, the articulation is therefore a species of enarthrosis ; there is neither a costo-vertebral interosseous ligament, nor a superior costo-transverse ligament; the syno- vial membrane is much looser than in the cor- responding articulations of other ribs. b. Costo-vertebral, articulation of the 1 Ith and I2tk ribs. — These present the same cha- racters as the preceding, in this respect, that the anterior cavity for the head of the bone is situated upon a single vertebra. The head of the rib, however, is flattened, or very slightly convex. There is no interosseous costo- vertebral ligament. The superior costo-trans- verse ligament is much broader and stronger than in the other articulations. As the 11th and 12th ribs have no tubercles, and the transverse processes ©f the corresponding vertebrae are but little developed, it follows that there is no costo-transverse articulation ; but yet there is a costo-transverse interos- seous ligament. All these ligaments are much more loose than in the other articulations. Srdly. With the sternum (Chondro-sternal articulation). — The costo-stemal articulation is between the angular extremities of the car- tilages of the ribs and the corresponding fossae in the margins of the sternum ; these ar- ticulations are covered and supported by two sets of ligaments. 1st, by an anterior set of ligamentous fibres, thin, scattered, and radi- ated (Jigamenta radialim disjecta Weitbr.), passing from the extremity of the cartilage to the anterior surface of the sternum, where they interlace with those of the op- posite side, and are blended with the apo- neurosis of the pectoralis major muscle. 2ndly, by a posterior set of fibres similarly disposed, but not so thick or numerous, con- necting the thoracic surfaces of the same parts ; together with some ligamentous fibres placed above, and others below the joint. A synovial membrane is interposed be- tween the ends of each true rib, and the sternum. These membranes can be demon- strated by slicing off a little of the anterior surface of the sternum and cartilages. Cruveil- hier doubts the existence of such synovial membranes ; we are inclined to differ from him in this respect. Characters peculiar to chondro- or costo- stemal articulations. —The 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th chondro-sternal articulations present the following peculiarities : — 1st, The cartilage of the 1st rib is some-1033 THORAX. times continuous with the sternum, and is sometimes articulated like the cartilages of the other ribs. Cruveilhier found in one sub- ject the 1st rib excessively moveable, because its cartilage, instead of being continuous with the sternum, had its upper edge applied to the side of that bone to which it was united by ligaments, and was ultimately articulated by a narrow extremity immediately above the 2nd rib. 2ndly. The second cartilage is much more angular at its inner extremity than any of the others : it is received into the retreating angle formed by the union of the first two pieces of the sternum. Sometimes there is an inter- osseous ligament in this joint, running from the angle of the cartilage to the bottom of the cavity, and there are then two synovial cap- sules ; in other cases there is only one, but it is always more marked than in the other joints. The articulations of the Gth and 7th carti- lages, besides the anterior ligaments, have also a chondro- or costo-.viphoid ligament, more or less strong, which crosses with the ligament of the opposite side in front of the ensiform car- tilage, and the lower end of the sternum. Sometimes this ligament only exists for the 7th cartilage ; it is intended not only to strengthen the chondro-sternal articulation, but also to maintain the xiphoid appendix in its place. Connection of the ribs with their cartilages. — The cartilages are almost immoveably united to the ribs, being received into rounded depressions on the ends of the ribs, and their union is maintained only by periosteum, which may be considered to represent their liga- ments. Articulations of the costal cartilages one tvith Uie other. — Some of the costal cartilages articulate with each other by their edges. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th costal car- tilages do not articulate together, unless the aponeurotic lamella?, sometimes very strong, which form the continuation of the external intercostal muscles, and occupy the whole length of the cartilages, be considered as uniting media. The Gth, 7th, and 8th cartilages, frequently the oth, and sometimes the 9th, present true articulations with one another. Cartilaginous processes arise from the neighbouring edges and come in contact with each other : there are sometimes two articular faces between the Gth and 7th cartilages. The means of union are some vertical fibres united in bundles, so as to form two ligaments, the one anterior and thicker, the other posterior and thinner. The edges of the articulating surfaces, from the Gth to the 8th or 9th, are lined by sy- novial membrane. The 7th, 8th, and 10th cartilages have not always articular surfaces, but are simply united by vertical ligaments. Ligaments of the sternum {Membranes sterni, Weitbr.). — The pieces of the sternum are connected by a layer of fibro-cartilage, placed between their contiguous borders ; and, on the anterior and posterior surfaces, liga- mentous fibres may be observed running longi- tudinally, which serve to strengthen their con- nection. They are sometimes called the anterior and posterior sternal ligaments. The longitudinal fibres are mixed with those ra- diating from the costal cartilages, especially in front of the sternum, where likewise they blend with the aponeurosis of the pectoral muscles. The anterior portion has thus most of the accessory fibres, and is rough and irre- gular ; the posterior one is smooth and pearly in its aspect. The muscles of the thorax will be more con- veniently noticed hereafter. Of the Thorax in general. — The ster- num, the ribs and their cartilages, together with the dorsal vertebrae, are so united to- gether as to compose the frame-work of the thorax, (fig. G62.) Their arrangement is such as collectively to admit of great mobility, and at the same time to protect completely the or- gans of respiration and the heart. How well adapted this mechanism is for protecting those vital organs is well shown by the impunity with which the prize-fighter receives for many hours the trained blows of his antagonist. Although the range of motion between each vertebra and the ribs attached to it, is very limited, yet the whole frame-work of the chest enjoys such mobility, that, by a deep inspiration, its capacity is sometimes more than doubled. This bony frame-work is by no means destined solely to cover the respira- tory organs, for it extends considerably down- wards, composing part of the abdominal walls within which lie the liver, spleen, kidneys, stomach, duodenum, and part of the colon ; hence the distinction between thoracic and diaphragmatic ribs. In fact it will be found that about one half only of the costal surface is destined to compose the thorax. The shade running transversely across the ribs in Jig. G32. marks the bottom of the thoracic cavity. In each individual the thoracic cavity cor- responds exactly with the volume of the heart and lungs. But there is no relation between the volume of the lungs and the vigour of the constitution — nor between the size of the ca- vity of the thorax and the amount of air w hich can be respired, as will be hereafter shown. There is likewise no relation between the vo- lume of the thorax and that of the abdominal cavity. No doubt the vigour of aeration in the lungs is at all times exactly commensurate with the vigour of the alimentary canal, so that the one harmonises with the other; but this vigour bears no relation to space or size. A small thorax may in some individuals admit of the inspiration of a greater volume of air than a larger thorax in others. In fact it may be commonly noticed that where there is a large abdomen there is generally a small thorax, and that the volume of air which can be expelled at one effort from the lungs of those who have a large abdomen, is less than from those with a small abdomen. The alimentary canal receives at once a given quantity of food, and there it remains for an indefinite time, the thorax large or small, itTHORAX. 1031 matters not which, aerates the blood from this food by movements, quick or slow, long or short; therefore the respiratory movements only, need be relative to the abdominal cavity, in the same way as the volume of the blast from a pair of bellows is more dependent on their mobility than on their absolute size. The above remarks are applicable to the thorax of either male or female. I. Boundaries of the thoracic cavity.— The thoracic cavity, situated between the shoul- ders and below the neck, extends but a short way downwards, in the male about seven inches, and in the female about eight inches, beiow the clavicle, so that a horizontal line drawn about an inch below the axilla, corres- ponds (roughly) with its floor. The floor of the chest, therefore, is much higher up in the trunk of the body than is commonly supposed. The thorax is bounded anteriorly by the sternum and costal cartilages ; laterally by the bodies of the ribs and the intercostal muscles ; posteriorly by the vertebras and angles of the ribs, and inferiorly by a thin tendinous and fleshy floor— the diaphragm. The su- rior aperture of the chest is about sixteen inches in circumference, this is the smaller end, and thence called the apex of the tho- rax. It is bounded laterally by the two 1st ribs, anteriorly by the upper edge of the sternum and inter-articular ligament, and posteriorly by the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. The inferior aperture is about thirty or thirty-one inches in circumference, and forms the base of the chest. Anatomists describe this part as bounded in front by the cartilaginous extremity of the sternum or xiphoid cartilage, and the cartilaginous extremities of the last true and false ribs, and more laterally by the 11th and 12th ribs, pos- teriorly by the last dorsal and first lumbar vertebra;. But as they assume to themselves the privilege of giving a bone a surgical neck as well as an anatomical one, so may we take a similar liberty in describing the thorax for medical purposes. In the examination of the chest during life, too exclusive attention to anatomical boundary has probably led to the error, of regarding the chest as much deeper than it really is, and thence to examining for disease of the lung where really little or no lung exists. A sharp instrument, piercing the chest laterally, at the cartilaginous extremities .of the last true ribs, would most probably pene- trate no lung, for the liver, spleen, stomach, &c. are contained within these points. The bottom of the chest is so moveable and so much arched (See art. Diaphragm, fig. 3.), that in the different stages of inspiration, the lung assumes different positions This may be demonstrated by percussing over the 5th rib at its junction with its cartilage, first after a deep expiration and then after a deep inspira- tion ; in the latter the sound is " clear," in the former it is strikingly " dull." Therefore, instead of taking the insertion of the dia- phragm as the bottom of the thorax, it will be found more convenient for examining the chest to take the top of the arch of this muscle as the lower thoracic boundary, or the shaded line crossing the ribs in fig. 4., for the medical base. This may be described as corres- ponding in front with the xiphoid cartilage ; laterally to different osseous portions of the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and sometimes the 12th rib (fig. 682.), and posteriorly to the 8th and 9th dorsal vertebrae. This will place the bottom of the thorax in a very different posi- tion from what is generally supposed ; for, if we express the distance from the 1st rib, to the lowest point of the 10th rib as 13-5, that from the 1st rib to the arch of the diaphragm or medical boundary will be only G'25, less than one half the depth of the thorax as ana- tomically described. The medical base of the thorax forms a nearly horizontal plane, which extends between the sternum and the bo- dies of the 9th or 10th dorsal vertebrae, its posterior being somewhat higher than its an- terior. But on each side of the bodies of the vertebrae there is a deep groove formed by the angles of the ribs. In that part of this groove which extends below the above-mentioned in- clined plane, a wedge-shaped process of lung is lodged, which varies in size in different sub- jects, and consequently will be found to ter- minate at different points in the dorsal re- gion, as already noticed, sometimes hanging down like a broad, thick flap, and at other times forming only an insignificant process. In examining the chest, it is of paramount importance that the student should familiarly know this medical floor of the thorax. The sign laid down by the late Dr. Edwyn Har- rison, for marking this boundary, we have found strictly correct in every normal-shaped thorax. Namely, take the xiphoid cartilage as a point to start from, and pass the fiat hand horizontally from thence to the side of the chest, the index finger, when horizontal, will distinguish a slight depression or sulcus at the maximum lateral bulge of the thorax, then from this point slide the hand slightly upwards (perpendicularly), and it will pass over a bulge, about enough to fill the palm of the hand, into another sulcus, better defined than the former one ; this groove corresponds with the medical base of the thorax, and a probe passed in here would graze the arch of* the diaphragm after passing through the moveable inferior edges of the lungs. It is necessary that the hand be kept pertectly horizontal, or it will fall into an intercostal space, which does not correspond with the groove in question. With practice, the hand falls at once into the upper sulcus, without first searching for the lower one; indeed, latterly, Dr. Harrison allowed that the lower sulcus might be absent, and yet the upper one present. This groove is higher upon the right side than upon the left, corresponding to the height of the liver. By external observation, the medical base of the thorax may be known by the slight rota- tory motion made upon the diaphragm when a person is walking. A kind of great ball and socket-joint may be conceived to exist between the abdomen and thorax, and the1035 THORAX. outer garments even exhibit a correspondence to this base of the thorax. II. Contents of the thorax. — Not only does the thorax contain organs proper to itself, but it lodges and protects others passing to the abdomen; thus, the food we eat passes through the thorax to enter the stomach, while the eighth nerve both supplies the lungs and then passes onwards to the stomach. Like other cavities, the thorax is lined with a serous membrane {pleura costalis), which like- wise invests the lungs (pleura pulmonalis') (See Pleura). The heart and its blood- vessels, the trachea, and the lungs, almost completely fill the thorax. The remaining organs, viz., the origin of the sterno-hyoid and -thyroid muscles, remains of the thymus gland, lymphatic glands, mammary vessels, triangulares sterni muscles, the phrenic, the eighth pair, and the splanchnic nerves, the oesophagus, thoracic duct, vena azygos, and vense cavas, occupy very little space. Thus the thorax is completely filled. The older anatomists, however, even as late as Benj. Hoadley's time, considered that there was a considerable space containing air, between the lungs and the walls of the thorax. Now, we know that any considerable accumulation of air in this situation would be destructive to the respiratory function. III. Shape of the thorax.—The shape of the thorax is subject to many varieties which may be conveniently studied under the fol- lowing headings: External thorax. — The thorax in the perfect subject is somewhat conical, broader above than it is below ; but when deprived of the upper extremities and their appen- dages, the contrary obtains, for it is nar- rower above than it is below (see Jigs. 662. and 630. ct scq.). Therefore the notion we commonly connect with broad shoulders or broad back, has but a feeble relation with the absolute breadth of the thorax. In fact the diameter of the neck corresponds more correctly with the diameter of the upper part or true apex of the thorax. Freeman the American giant measured 26 inches from tip to tip of his shoulders, while the diameter at the lower part of his neck, in the same direction, was only 6 inches. In women the mammas materially add to the dimensions of the chest towards the apex. We have found the measure of a female round the thorax over the mamma? 45^ inches, while the root of the neck was 15 inches. Allowing two inches for muscle, &c, the true thoracic apex would not exceed 13 inches, whilst 45^ inches was the apparent circumference of the thorax. The true apex of the thorax is loaded with large muscles, sometimes a vast quantity of fat, the upper extremities, and in the female with large mammas besides. The true baseof the chestis comparatively little covered, particularly below the axilla, where the serrati are seen. This is the weakest and thinnest part of the thorax, but it is well protected by the arms. (a) The anterior or sternal region of the tho- rax.—In a well-developed thorax the sternum appears to lie in a fossa formed by the pecto- rales and mammae. This region assumes more or less of the perpendicular, according to the carriage of the person ; a perpendicular drawn to the external plane of the sternum would, however, be directed upwards. Laterally to this, the costal cartilages articulate with the sternum ; and, still more laterally, the ribs and their cartilages unite, forming an oblique ridge from above downwards. (See figs. 680. and 681. the line on each side of the sternum.) Still more externally, and parallel to this, may be noticed the projections formed by the anterior angles of the ribs, which bound the anterior region. (b) The posterior or vertebral region. — In the well-developed thorax the spines of the dorsal vertebras lie in a deep groove formed by the great mass of the erector spinas on either side. These masses extend outwards to about the posterior angles of the ribs, which are nearly in a plane with the spinous processes of the vertebras, and may be easily distin- guished, bounding the posterior region. (c) The lateral or costal region is composed of the bodies of the ribs and the intercostal spaces. Much difference has prevailed amongst writers upon various points con- nected with the ribs, and the spaces be- tween the ribs. Probably this may have arisen from their having made their observa- tions upon the dead subject, wherein the ribs have collapsed to their minimum, or the thorax of a thin subject with the ribs expanded by, perhaps, 200 cubic inches of air, or the ribs when artificially articulated in the clean skele- ton, wherein they are generally arranged too wide apart and too horizontal. In the collapsed state of the ribs, i. c. after the most ample expiration by death, we no- tice 1st, That the intercostal spaces are not of a uniform width from the vertebras to the ster- num. They are most narrow behind, and be- come wider as they approach the sternum (Jig. 680.). The 1st, 2d, and 3rd spaces upon the whole are broader than the five next in- ferior, and the 10th and 11th spaces are the widest (fig. 682.). 2dly, Their length differs with the length of the ribs; thus the two first and two last spaces are the shortest. 3dly, The position of the intercostal spaces is very oblique (fig. 6S4.), roughly speaking, about mid-way between the horizontal and the perpendicular. 4thly, They are moveable, and in the dif- ferent stages of respiration they can assume different positions and different perpendicular widths. It has been found necessary for the con- venience of auscultation, to subdivide the thorax more minutely. The subdivision pro- posed by Laennec has been generally adopted, although some of the terms, like those of the respiratory sounds, have been modified by writers of later date. The anterior anil lateral superior division,1036 THORAX. Table C. — Thoracic Regions. REGION.

Below Harrison's line, there is little or no evidence, from percussion, of the presence of lung, except in deep inspiration, and then the sound on per- cussion is mixed with other sounds from the abdominal organs. Only a small part of the mammary region covers lung, scarcely any being subjacent to the anterior parts of the 6th,°7th, and 8th ribs. (See fig. 4, wherein a transverse shading indicates the diaphragm.) Internal conformation of the thorax. — To comprehend clearly the internal shape of the thorax, it is necessary to take a cast of this cavity. This may be done by making an open- ing in the sternal region, just large enough to admit the hand to remove the heart and lungs, filling up the whole of the cavity with plaster of Paris and returning the sternum, then opening the abdomen, cutting away the diaphragm, and so removing the cast, which •nves us a clear knowledge of the internal conformation, and every kind of measurement correctly. (Fig. 667. is a cast from the cavity of figs. 680—685, — male subject.) We have stated that the perfect thorax viewed externally, and the same when the superficial muscles and upper extremities are removed, differ widely in their relative form. The tho- racic cavity likewise differs remarkably from either of these views. The general view is that of a cone, but broader from side to side than from before backwards : therefore the cone is somewhat flattened. (a) Anterior region. — This very closely re- sembles the anterior region of the external surface, being convex in its form, precisely corresponding with the concave sternum. The upper part, immediately behind the superior end of the sternum, is rather concave (fig. 667 ). At this part the cavity divides into two small cones, for the reception of the right and left apices of the lungs, which ascend upwards to a variable height, — an inch or an inch and a half. Both apices of the lungs are directed from below, upwards Fig. 667. a Cast of the cavity of the thorax represented in Jigs, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. and forwards; it is incorrect to consider them as directed backwards ( fig. 667, a, which is the left apex seen above the 1st rib.) In some cases, particularly where the lung presents a puckered appearance, the axis of the apex is inclined nearly to the horizontal, and at all times it is about per- pendicular to the sternum. These apice3, throughout advancing life, are tending to in- cline forwards ; it is this portion above the 1 st rib (fig. 667.), which is so vulnerable in phthisis pulmonalis. There is great difference in the precise character of these apices in different individuals; in fact we have seen no two the same ; some are remarkably truncated, and broad from before backwards ; others are thia in this direction, and pointed; some obtuse and low, others acute and high. They have the1037 THORAX. same characters In both sexes. There is little difference in the height of the two apices. The elevation of the liver on the right side does not necessarily cause the right apex to be the higher. The right lung is more shallow than the left; but this is not because it is " pushed up," but because, in order to ac- commodate the liver, there is less lung- substance on the right side. If the mean of a series of observations represents the right side of the thoracic cavity as equal to 151, the left may be given as 182. The same may be said of both sexes. (b) Posterior region. — If we examine this region upon a cast of the thoracic cavity, we observe in the middle line a deep fossa, formed by the projection, to the very centre of the thoracic cavity, of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae. This fossa is wider towards the base of the thorax, as may be seen by comparing the dif- ferent sections of the cast (compare the notches, 10, 11, and 12, with those of 3,4, and b in fig. 668.). Fig. 668. ; Sections of a cast o f the thorax showing the space encompassed by each pair of ribs respectively. The bodies of the thoracic vertebra, form almost a complete septum ; they are certainly a central column of support for the whole trunk of the body, bearing an equal distri- bution of the superincumbent weight in all directions. There is no part of the skeleton which more strikingly demonstrates that man was destined for the erect posture, than this central position, together with the increasing dimensions from above downwards, of the vertebral column. These conditions exist only in the human subject. The groove in the cast formed by the dorsal vertebra is directed upwards and forwards, so that at the apex of the thoracic cavity it completely divides the lungs, producing two little cones laterally for the lungs, forming the right and left apex. At the base of the thorax this perpendicular column again completely divides the lower lobes of the two lungs. The shape of the posterior part of the cast is that of a curve directed upwards, and sharply forwards, near the apex (fig.667.). This curve near the apex is, like the form of the apices, very various. An inflated lung assumes the same shape as this cast, giving even the marks of the ribs. The student, in order to have a correct idea of the lungs, should remove them from the body with the heart attached ; then inflate them to their utmost, when their shape, their lobes, and relative mass before and behind, are clearly seen. If now we inspect the cavity of the thorax itself, we find that the bodies of the vertebra by their projection as above described, divide the posterior portion of the chest into two vast lateral grooves, which lodge the posterior portions of the lungs; these two grooves, partaking of the form of the thorax, are consequently conical in their configuration. They lodge fully one half of the entire lungs. This is worthy of remembering in reference to diagnosis, particularly when pneumonia is sus- pected ; in such cases auscultation of the dorsal region demands as much attention as that of the anterior region. Though less vulnerable to phthisis pulmonalis, yet it may lodge disease in parts comparatively remote, and where in- flammation may insidiously gain serious ground upon the patient, particularly in children. (c) Lateral rcgio?i. — This precisely corre- sponds with the external lateral view of the thorax (compare fig. 667. with fig. 680.); it presents indentation of the ribs, resembling a diagonal, curved, grate. (d) The base of the thoracic cavity has been described above. Conformation as affected by age and sex. — Age alters the conformation of the chest. In the earlier periods of existence the thorax is the smallest of the three great cavities, probably from the inactivity of the lungs. In the fbetal thorax the antero-posterior dia- meter exceeds the transverse ' diameter, the sternum projecting forwards, and the heart and thymus gland filling up the middle of the cavity. The ribs in fetal life are less curved, and conse- quently those deep grooves, seen in the interior of the chest on each side the spine, formed by the angle of the ribs, so conspicuous in after life, are almost wanting ; the vertical depth also is much less at this period, because the lungs are unexpanded and unemployed, while the abdominal viscera, particularly the1038 THORAX. large liver, are in activity and pushing up the diaphragm. The superior opening or true apex is greater from before backwards than trans- versely, which is the very contrary to the adult conformation. The inferior or true base of the thorax is extremely wide in every direction, from the encroachment of the ab- dominal viscera. At birth the thorax sud- denly enlarges, by the air expanding the lungs to two or three times their previous cubic dimensions. As age increases, the curvatures of the ribs increase, and, with the vertebrae, running up through the very centre of the tho- rax, form the two great lateral grooves, peculiar to man, for lodging the chief bulk of the lungs. The depth of the thorax is diminished, while its breadth is increased, and this participates in that more perfect development of the system at the age of puberty. It is at this time that malformation of the chest fre- quently becomes obvious, particularly in females. In the adult age the thorax still grows, but in a degree less apparent, until it assumes the form of what is termed an open chest, capable of expanding in any di- rection, supplying us with air under violent exercise, and resisting severe blows. As age advances, through the decline of life, the thorax has a tendency to collapse ; the bony framework threatens to unite into one rigid cage, the true apex droops forward, the shoul- ders appear higher, and the round back of old age becomes apparent, so that we may make a tolerable guess at the age of an individual by the conformation of the back. The erect thorax is absolutely necessary to healthy vigour, while the drooping-forward chest is always accompanied with proportionate feeble- ness. gCXm — The chief difference of external conformation between the sexes is due to the largeness of the mamma;, and the less width across the shoulders in women than in men. There is no distinguishing the sexes by the internal form of the thorax, they so perfectly resemble each other. The chest of the female is only absolutely smaller, but not al- ways that, certainly not relatively so. The nipples are not uniformly in the same posi- tion ; those of the female are generally closer together than those of the male. Conformation of the thorax affected by disease and occupation. — The conformation of the thorax chiefly depends upon the healthy condition of the main pillar of support, the spine ; but not always so, for that deformity called " chicken breast" appears to be inde- pendent of the condition of the spine. And, again, emphysema of the lungs tends to pro- trude the ribs and advance the sternum. Disease, as caries of the vertebras, or an atonic condition of the thoracic muscles, owing to which the spinal column may yield, either laterally, producing " lateral curvature," or an- teriorly, giving " angular curvature," produces the most0 marked distortion of this pillar of support, and consequently of the whole thorax. In youth, particularly in females, (from the pre- sent system of education,) the spinal column, which is at all times sufficiently flexible, bends under the weight of the head and arms ; and for want of proper exercise the muscles of the back become enfeebled, and unable to restore it to the erect position. When " rickets" attack the spine, it may curve in any direction, com- pressing the ribs and projecting the sternum. It is surprising to witness to what an extent of deformity the thorax may attain, and yet life still remain (see fig. 6G6., where costal respiration could not exist ; and where all the abdominal viscera must have been forced up into the cavity of the thorax, for the 10th rib is nearly touching the crista of the ilium). We have noticed a case where such was the effort of nature to pre- serve the thoracic and spinal cavities, that life was maintained in a boy 14 years of age, though 7 bodies of dorsal vertebrae were com- pletely absorbed. In emphysema of the lungs, the sternum is protruded, and the antero-posterior diameter of the thorax is increased sometimes by an inch, the shoulders are raised, and the person assumes always the form of a man who has made the deepest inspiration. In phthisis pulmonalis, the thorax changes its form, which is manifested by the shoulders inclining forwards, the anterior and superior parts bending in the same direction; the otherwise round full apex becomes flattened, collapsing upon itself; and there is an in- capacity to extend the apex ; this is a sure and delicate test of that disease threatening, before any symptoms can be detected by au- scultation. In other stages there is a loss of symmetry in the sides. In pleuritic effusion or in empyema, one side may be full and immov- able, whilst the other has to perform the respiratory functions. In fact, disease of the respiratory organs may produce a change in the form of the thorax, either downwards, upwards, or outwards, or by collapse of the apex. Frequently repeated or permanent compres- sion, may produce many varieties of conforma- tion of the thorax. Cruveilhier observes that infants, in whom the thorax was perfectly well formed at birth, have become deformed and flattened on the sides of the thorax, by pres- sure from the hands of the nurse. Slight ex- ternal pressure in early life may be productive of permanent deformity of the thorax. The effect of strong and permanent constriction, as from tight stays, occasions a distortion in the form of the chest. This kind of com- pression principally affects the lower part of the thorax ; so that the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs are pressed forwards and in- wards, because the length of their cartilages allow them to yield readily : and the viscera corresponding to these ribs, also undergo alteration in their position and figure, en- croaching upon the thoracic cavity, com- pressing the lungs upwards, into the apices of the chest. The imprudent custom of females wearing a hard unyielding piece of wood, steel, or whalebone up the front of their corset, commonly produces a compression inwards of1039 THORAX. the sternum. We once noticed a case where the sternum was forced inwards to such an ex- tent, that the entire depth of the thorax, by external measurement, from the middle of the sternum to the corresponding part of the back, only measured 2 inches instead of 8 or 9 inches ! Occupation likewise modifies the form of -the thorax. The clerk who writes many hours at the desk, carries himself dif- ferently to the soldier. Coal-miners have stooping chests when they work in districts where the coal seam is thin, and the roof consequently low, as in the north of Eng- land. In fact, all trades or occupations which require stooping for many hours to- gether, tend to injure and malform the chest. Pigeon- or chicken-breast. —This is a mal- formation quite distinct from any of the above mentioned, always affecting the sternal region in particular. An explanation of this curious disease has attracted the attention of Mr. Shaw, to whom we are indebted for the following remarks.* He noticed the effects produced upon the thorax by violent efforts of breathing in a child with croup. If we watch, says Mr. Shaw, the motions of the thorax in a young patient who is in danger of suffocation from an obstruction in the wind-pipe, we shall perceive that at each inspiration, while the superior ribs and sternum are raised ami protruded as in com- mon costal breathing, the lower ribs are, at first, flattened, and then drawn inwards, so as to produce a deep indentation on both sides. The depression is greatest in the line of junction of the ribs with their cartilages; it is as if a band had been tied tightly round the waist, or resembles the indentation near the margin of the chest, often seen in women from tight lacing. The constriction lasts during inspiration; in expiration, the ribs by their elasticity flap out and recover their form. That the lower ribs should be drawn inwards in the act of inspiration, diminishing the area of the chest at a time when their natural motion should enlarge it, will be un- derstood by considering the relative conditions of the thorax and the lungs in the laboured respiration which arises from obstruction in the wind-pipe. Under the sense of impend- ing suffocation, the young patient instinctively struggles to enlarge the cavity of the chest to its greatest capacity ; but, while that effort is making, the quantity of air that passes into the lungs is very small, because of the obstruction in the larynx or trachea : a portion of air may reach the air-cells at the apex where the bronchial tubes are short, but little or none penetrates so far as the base of the lungs ; consequently the lungs are imperfectly dilated. If the child succeed in enlarging the area of the chest in proportion to its powerful efforts, while the lungs were at the same time but partially dilated, it would follow that a vacuum would be produced in the space between the * Deformity of the Chest from Dyspnoea, Oct. 1841. Loud. Med. Gaz. New Series, vol. i. 1S42. parietes of the thorax and lungs. But owing to the great flexibility of the ribs near the lower margin of the thorax in childhood, the atmospheric pressure overcomes the action of the muscles, and thrusts in the sides so as to preserve the balance of the air within and that without : in common language, the walls of the chest on each side are " sucked " inwards, like the valve in a pair of bellows. When we look at the general shape of the chest during the continuation of the con- striction, we perceive at once a resemblance to the pigeon-breast deformity ; there is in both the same protrusion of the sternum, and the same depression of the cartilages on each side. The question therefore arises, can the de- formity have a similar origin to the change in the figure of the chest which is caused by difficult respiration ? Dupuytren wrote a memoir upon this form of distortion, and he has shown that difficult respiration and pigeon- breast deformity are frequently associated to- gether, so that he has almost constantly found that patients who are pigeon-breasted have at the same time enlargement of the tonsils; but Dupuytren does not profess to explain why the two complaints should go together. Some years ago Mr. Shaw had under his care a little boy with greatly enlarged tonsils, which were very low down in the throat, owing, as it appeared, to their having got within the grasp of the constrictor muscles of the pharynx. He had constant dyspnoea, and occasional fits of suffocation, in one of which Mr. Shaw performed laryngotomy: on his admission into the hospital, and for several weeks afterwards, it was observed that he had the " pigeon-breast" form of chest ; but after his tonsils were excised, and his breathing had been perfectly free for some time, the sternum subsided to its proper level, and the thorax recovered its natural shape. These facts prove that a connection, like cause anil effect, exists between obstruction of the air passages and pigeon-breast de- formity. It is not necessary that such impe- diments should be so great as to produce strongly marked symptoms of dyspnoea ; for, while the distortion is being produced the child is growing,—both the size and shape of the chest are undergoing a natural change. Mr. Shaw justly considers it quite possible that a cause which may have very slight in- fluence in changing the figure of the thorax, if operating only for a week or a month, will, if continued longer, disturb and modify the pro- cess of growth ; so that after intervals of half- years or years, a decided effect will be exhibited in the form of the chest. It is not impossible that continued disease in the air passages of children, w hich may fail to attract much at- tention, or at least may not be thought capa- ble of producing distortion, may nevertheless gradually and insidiously give rise to the per- manent deformity of " pigeon-breast." Mr. Shaw particularly refers to enlargement of the tonsils, attended even with slight incon- venience; to enlargement of the lymphatic1040 THORAX. glands in the course of the trachea or bronchi; to pressure upon the trachea by the thymus gland, when later than natural in being ab- sorbed, or when hypertrophied ; and to mor- bid thickening of the mucous membrane of the larynx, or of the trachea and bronchi succeeding croup or cynanche pharyngea. We concur with these views upon this sub- ject, the more so as we likewise have noticed the pigeon-breast in children where enlarged tonsils have been present. We must not imagine from this that, where there is dyspncea, there we shall always find the deformity in question; for difficult breathing may be caused by other circumstances than those which dis- turb the counter-pressure of the atmosphere in the thorax. IV. Dimensions of the thorax.—The mea- surement of the thorax may be considered externally and internally; and, what is most remarkable, the one class of measurements may not have any relation to the other class. Moreover, the external measurements bear a certain proportion to the whole frame, whilst the internal do not. (a) External measurements of the thorax.— The external dimensions of the thorax differ much in different men ; this is obvious to all. There is the broad-chested and the nar- row-chested man. Mr. Brent has calculated, from an extensive number of observations, the following proportions, which we arrange thus:— Table D.—Relation of the External Chest to the Height, measured over the Nipples. Minimum chest : 4. of the stature — JT of the stature = circumference of chest. Medium chest: i of the stature + of the stature — circumference of chest. Maximum chest: \ of the stature = circumference of chest. For example, let us suppose a height of 61 inches, as follows,— Minimum chest: height 61 in., \ — 30"5 in. — Jj- = 29-5 in. circumference of chest. Medium chest: height 61 in., \ — 30\5 in. + ^ (= 4'07) = 34*57 in. circumference of chest. Maximum chest: height 61 in., f = 40"7 in. = circumference of chest. Thus, by taking the most perfectly propor- tioned chests, either from living figures or from the classical athletae of ancient sculptures, the following is the result. Table E. — External Thoracic Dimensions, (in three classes according to weight) in rela- tion to the height, obtained from calculation. MALES : CIRCUMFERENCE OF THORAX. Height.

We have found from observation, upon 1276 cases of all various classes conjoined, a re- gular arithmetical progression of the thoracic circumference over the nipples in relation to weight. By the total mean of our observations the chest increases exactly one inch for every 10 lbs. increase of weight, sinking the effect of height, which, however, cannot well be omitted, because, as a general rule, the height increases with the weight. Mr. Brent has found that twice the breadth of the shoulders equals the circumference of the thorax over the nipples — i. e. from point to point, or the caliber of the broadest part of the shoulders. Thus, if the caliber be 18 inches, the thorax will be 36 inches in circumference. Four times the distance between the nipples is equal to the circum- ference. Four times the antero-posterior diameter is equal to the circumference : there- fore the distance between the nipples is equal to the depth from before backwards of the ex- ternal thorax. At the height of 5 feet 9 inches this antero-posterior diameter varies from 1\ inch, to 12} inches. (b) Internal measurement of the thoracic cavity.—Before entering into details we may observe, that the thoracic cavity is much smaller than we might, perhaps, be led to expect; that the depth from above down- wards is, when compared with the body, very shallow. It is, however, capable of enormous dilatation or mobility, even to 100 per cent; 80 per cent is common. The absolute dimensions of the thoracic ca- vity of females are obviously smaller than those of males, because they are altogether of smaller conformation, both in stature and weight; but, relatively, the difference is probably little, Although the proportion of some of the diameters may differ, yet that of the total cubic measurements appears not to do so. A certain rude relation of necessity must exist between the size of a man and the dimensions of his thoracic cavity. A man 7 feet high will have a larger chest than one 5 feet or 6 feet high. But there is no constant and uniform relation of the size of the chest, either to the height or weight ofTHORAX. 1041 the body. The function of the chest, how- ever, as indicated by the quantity of air which we can expel, is in strict relation to the mi- nute difference of a single inch of stature, or to 10 lbs. of weight. It appears probable that the function of an organ may be exactly re- lative to the size of the body, increasing or decreasing with it, while the organ itself bears no visible relation of volume either to its own activity or to the dimensions of the body. The greatest perpendicular depth of the thoracic cavity, nearly corresponds with the greatest lateral measurement; or if the depth be 8-7 the breadth is 9"7, and allowing for the mobility of the base of the thorax, the depth may yet more closely correspond to the breadth. The average perpendicular depth of the female thorax exactly corresponds with the average breadth, being 8-l inches in both measure- ments. The greatest antero-posterior dia- meter in both sexes, i. e. from the sternum to the deepest part of the great lateral groove at the angle of the rib, is always less than the greatest lateral breadth, being as 6 to 9 in the male, and as 6 to 8 in the female. These diameters, however, in no way cor- respond to the stature. A man, 5 feet 4 inches high, measured from the apex of the chest to the base 10^ inches, whilst' a man of 5 feet 10 inches, only measured 7 i inches in the same direction, or the shorter man exceeded the taller by 3 inches in the per- pendicular depth of his thoracic cavity: — but the taller man could exceed the shorter by a volume of 77 cubic inches of air at one deep expiration. In fact, the whole of the Pis. G69. Area in Height. Sup. in. ft. in. 36 5 4 50 5 10 Height, ft. in. 5 6 Area in Sup. in. 36 5 10 63 Sections of the Cliest at the base.

If we take a cast of the thoracic cavity and view the base, it presents the shape of the figures in diagram fig. 669. which gives a mean measurement, in the males of forty-six, and in females of thirty-five, superficial inches In the diagram (reduced by scale), we affix the height of each case, and the area in su- perficial inches of such section. But the base of the thorax presents another measurement, that of the absolute area of the diaphragm. By the Jigs. 2. and 3., art.

The full measurement is nearly obtained, by slitting up the sides, as shown in figure A. and this condition gives it an increase of twenty-two superficial inches, making alto- gether 133 square inches; but even in this con- dition the entire arched muscle is not perfectly spread out. This was the diaphragm of a man five feet six inches high, with an exceedingly * By " vital capacity" is meant the measure of the mobility of the chest, as more fully explained hereafter. (P. 1056.) small chest, only twenty-nine inches in ex- ternal circumference, and whose vital capacity- was 188 cubic inches. The section, therefore, of the thorax to the area of the diaphragm is as 40 to 133, or 1 to 3'3. This renders the base of the thorax highly mobile. There is, perhaps invariably, a difference in the dimensions of the two sides of the thorax, in favour of the left side. The least difference which we observed was one cubic inch, but we think there must have been some error in this observation. Passing this over, we may say that the difference between the two sides varies from 10 to 77 cubic inches, and that, in all cases examined by us, the left side was larger than the right. This difference, also, we have found not to bear any relation to sex or stature. One female of 5 feet 4 inches in height had a difference of 77 cubic inches, which exceeds by 10 inches any of the males which we examined, up to 5 feet 10 inches high. Of the Respiratorv Muscles. — There are certain muscles especially destined to expand and contract the thoracic cavity, and there are others which act in different degrees as ac- cessories, they may be classed as direct and indirect respiratory muscles. The direct respirator}' muscles are, inter- costales externi and interni, levatores costarum, infra costa/es, triangularis sterni, and the dia- phragm. The indirect respiratory muscles are all those which straighten the spine or aid in fixing the whole body for the thoracic mus- cles to act from as a fixed point, whilst by their other attachment they elevate or depress the ribs; these are particularly the muscles of the neck and upper extremities, and those composing the walls of the abdo- men. More indirectly still, the muscles of the limbs assist in respiration; — in difficult respiration, the patient seizes hold of any fixed object, whilst he employs his whole muscular force to assist in inspiration, or, as Boerhaave has expressed it, " scarcely any particle remains in the body which is not more or less concerned in the business of respiration."* The indirect respiratory mus- cles, in fact, comprise nearly all the muscles of the body; therefore we shall only no- tice the direct respiratory muscles. The di- aphragm has already been described (art. Diaphragm). I. The intercostal muscles are arranged as two thin laminae between the ribs ; one lamella is external to the other, hence they are named external and internal. The fibres of each layer are oblique in their direction in reference to the ribs, and each layer has its fibres disposed in a contrary direction to those of the other; thus they are said to decussate. The twelve ribs form eleven intercostal spaces, conse- quently there are eleven such decussating lamellas on each side of the thorax, and twenty- two in all. Their attachments are to the in- ferior border of one rib, and to the superior * Prelect, ad Instit. 601. Morgagni. By Alex, ander, vol. i. p. 357.1043 THORAX. border of the next below. They do not ac- company each other throughout the entire intercostal space. These muscles, therefore, differ from each other in two ways, in the direction of their fibres, and in the extent of their attachment, for neither set are prolonged throughout the entire length of an intercostal space. (a) Intercostalcs externi.—These have their fibres running obliquely downwards and for- wards ; they are continued throughout the whole osseous intercostal space, i. e. from the tubercles of the ribs, to where the cartilages commence ; here they terminate. Haller once noticed these fibres " continued without interruption to the sternum, filling up the in- tercartilaginous spaces."* A thin aponeurosis is prolonged from the free anterior margin of this layer, up to the sternum, This muscular layer is thicker than the internal layer. Fig. 671. represents the anterior extremity of this Fig. 671. External intercostals. — Anterior view. layer, where it terminates with the osseous part of the rib, and Jig. 672. the posterior view, commencing at the vertebra. (b) Intercostales interni. — These, as their name implies, are internal to the above layer. Their fibres are likewise oblique, and have a contrary direction, downwards and backwards crossing the former layer. They commence at the sternum, fill up the intercartilaginous spaces, and part of the interosseous spaces, and terminate at the angles of the ribs. Fig. 671. represents them commencing at the sternum, and disappearing behind the ex- ternal layer. Figs. 673. and 674. show them for the remainder of their course ; in Jig. 673. they will be seen to terminate short of the verte- bral column. A thin aponeurosis is pro- longed from their free margin backwards, to the end of the intercostal spaces. All the intercostal fibres are oblique in their direction, with reference to the spine and ster- num. The fibres of one intercostal space differ * El. Phys. torn. iii. p. 29. Fig. 672. External intercostals. — Posterior view. in their degree of obliquity relatively to those of other intercostal spaces Thus, broadly, it may Fig. 673. Internal intercostals. — Posterior view. be stated that the external intercostal fibres in- crease in the degree of their obliquity as they Fig. 674. Internal intercostals. — Anterior view. proceed from the first to the last intercostal space; and that the Internal intercostal fibres, 3x21044 THORAX. on the contrary, decrease in the degree of their obliquity as they proceed in the same direc- tion. Moreover, for the most part the ex- ternal fibres increase in their obliquity in the same intercostal space as you proceed from the vertebras towards the sternum, and the internal intercostal fibres, on the contrary, increase their obliquity from the sternum towards the vertebrae, therefore they seldom decussate at right angles to each other, or form a perfect cross like the letter X. This is their general relative position at death, but, during life, in every stage of respiration, their degree of obliquity varies. The obliquity of the intercostal fibres should be viewed more with reference to the spine than to the ribs, because we shall show that their action is relative to the spine, and not to the ribs and that they may be perpendicular to two ribs, while they are oblique to the spine, because the ribs are themselves oblique. We have never seen any of the external intercostal fibres perpendicular to a rib, but we may see that arrangement in the internal layer of the lower intercostal spaces (fig. 673.). The omission of the relative posi- tion of the spine with reference to the ob- liquity of these muscles has led to many false conclusions as to their action in respiration. Let e e (fig. 675.) represent a spine or a rigid Fig. 675. body, and ac, bb two levers representing ribs, allowing of free rotation at their centres of motion a and b. These two bars are per- pendicular, or at 90°, with reference to the body EE; let l k represent a connecting tension or elastic fibre of any kind, this is oblique with reference to the two bars a c and bd, but move these bars down to the position of p 4, at an angle of 45° to the body e e, and the fibre l k becomes perpen- dicular to the two bars ; now move the bars up to p 3, also at an angle of 45° with e e, and the fibre l k becomes more oblique than at the position p 2. Therefore a tension may change from the oblique to the perperU- dicular relatively to the ribs; but it can never so change its relation to the spine. Thus if' k" and i/ k' between the bars at P 3 cross each other, in the same direc- tion, but in different degrees of obliquity; when the bars are at p 4., they decussate in directions contrary with reference to the bars, but not with reference to the body e e. The position of the ribs is similar to the bars at p 4, therefore the decussation of the inter- costal muscles must be viewed with reference to the spine. The intercostal fibres never cross each other like the lines i/k' and i/'k" (fig. 675.), nor can they, by any change of movement, ever assume thatposition ; i. e. if they do not decussate in a direction con- trary with relation to the spine, in no change of position, throughout the range of a semi- circle, can they ever become directly decus- sating fibres but when they directly cross each other as vd and v'b (fig. 676.) relative to e e, in every other position to which the bars Fig. 676. S can be moved, they will be seen still to main- tain the same decussation. Action of the intercostal muscles. — There is, probably, no subject in the whole range of science which has excited more violent con- tention and acrimonious dispute, than that of the action of the intercostal muscles. The illustrious and learned Haller could not enter this field of inquiry without pausing to ob- serve : " Let it be allowed me to deplore,THORAX. 1045 among the miseries of human life, that such anger and bitter quarrels should be forced upon us on account of matters wherein we are so little personally concerned."* Yet, strange to say, Haller opposed with extreme violence his contemporary Bamber- ger, whose investigations on this subject, though still extant, fell, consequently, into oblivion. We know not who discovered the two sets of intercostals. There appears to be no ac- count of them prior to Galen, a. d. 131. He observes, " the intercostal muscles help the midriff, that they might draw the chest in- ward."f Albinus (a.d. 1770) considered that both the internal and external layers " raise the ribs." J H. Cooke, a learned compiler of 1651, believed, they " constrained and dilated the chest," —" that the external layers bear down the ribs, and that the internal separate the ribs, so enlarging the thoracic cavity." (J Strange to say, after this Cooke divests these muscles of all thoracic motion whatever. In 1685 it was the received opinion that the external layer dilated, and that the inter- nal layer contracted the thorax. j| John Al- phonso Borelli led the way to a different opinion, which prevailed amongst most phy- siological writers. He believed, from mathe- matical reasoning, that " the fibres crossing each other produced only one effect, viz., the drawing of the ribs together,"—acting in the diagonal of the decussation. It is curious that he never considered the proba- bility of the two forces acting separately, as other antagonising muscles can do. W. Cheselden believed that both these muscles dilated the thorax, acting as elevators of the ribs, when the 1st rib was fixed by the scaleni and serratus posticus posterior.** Cooke follows the views of Cheselden and Borelli.ff Benjamin Hoadly takes another view ; and, in so doing, illustrates the subject with diagrams, and comes to the conclusion that the external layers elevate, and that the internal depress the ribs ; and that their com- bined action is to arrest the respiratory move- ment at will. He also says, " neither range can by their action push the ribs asunder."%% Winslow agrees with Borelli: presupposing, as usual, that the first rib is fixed. §§ Still the subject continued to be warmly dis- puted, when Haller published a controversial paper in 1746. In his "Elements "he treats the * El. Phys. vol. iii. p. 36. + De Usu Resp., ch. 15., 5 lib., De Usu Partium. J Tr., fol., ed. 1777. Tab. xvii. 9, 10, et seq. § Cooke's Descrip.

Franciscus Boissier de Sauvages agrees with him ; and the same is held by the majority, yet some doubt it. His opinion touching the internal layer is, that they likewise act as associates and ele- vators of the ribs with the external layer, be- cause " their superior attachment is nearer the sternum, and further from that bone in the lower ones ;" likewise, that " that por- tion of the internal layer placed between the bony parts of the ribs, cannot have a diffe- rent action from that portion placed between the cartilages." Joh. Swammerdam, Francis Bayle, J. Wilhelmus Pauli, Christianus Vater, Francis Nicholls, J. Fredericus Schreiber, differ from this, believing that the internal layers draw down the ribs. Now follows a sharp antagonist to Haller, viz. Hamberger, whose disputes with Haller we gather from Haller's writings, and not from Bamberger's writings. Hamberger breaks out with an entirely new view, which excites Haller to controversy.! Hamberger, says Haller J, believes that the external intercostal muscles have one action, — that they would raise the sternum: " that the internal layer would depress it." Ham- berger makes a machine " to demonstrate, that when the ribs are raised by these muscles their intervals are dilated ; when depressed, on the contrary, they are diminished." He furthermore gives, as his own discovery, that " the internal intercostals conjoining the os- seous portions of the ribs, and that portion which is between the cartilages, will raise them, and are therefore associated in action with the external layer." Hamberger was the first to assign a double action to the same class of muscles: he likewise believed that the whole ribs were lifted simultaneously^ Haller disputes the validity of Hamberger's experiments, upon the ground of his not con- sidering the relative mobility of the first and second rib ; because, says Haller, if the de- pressing power of the intercostal muscles is to the first rib as 20, the elevating power on the second rib, by reason of the difference of length and mobility, is as 380, nearly nine- teen times greater ; and the lower rib is to each superior rib, as far as the seventh, more moveable, in the ratio of 109 to 79. || We cannot see, with Haller, how the ten- * Vide Elementa Physiol. Corporis Humani, torn, iii., p. 28., et seq. Lausan. 4to., 1766. f Hamberger was bora 1697, and died in 1755. Haller's first anatomical paper upon respiration appeared in 1746, and his Elementa Physiol. Cor-, poris Humani, in 1757-66. J El. Phys. ib. p. 37. § Hamberger's writings on this subject were an essay De Respirationis Mechanismo, Jens, 1727, and also'Physiologia Medica, Jeme, 1751. — Ed. || Loc. cit. p. 39. et seq. 3x31046 THORAX. dencyof action of a muscle can be affected by the degree of mobility of a joint; for it is not necessary to the direction of the action of a muscle that a bone should move. Haller also denies that the two crossing fibres lengthen and shorten inversely to each other; or that the intercostal spaces widen by their action. Haller performed many experiments ; he ap- plied strings to the ribs of a wet preparation, representing the muscles, and pulled the strings, and the intercostal spaces diminished. By vivisections he determined, that in inspir- ation the internal intercostals, " simultane- ously with the external layer, contract, swell, and wrinkle, become perpendicular and hard, with united lifting of the ribs in rotation, the turning of the lower border forwards, the protrusion of the sternum, the descent of the diaphragm," &c. On the other hand, he observed in " expiration, relaxation of the whole series of intercostal muscles, increased lensth and obliquity, increased distance be- tween the spaces, relaxation of the diaphragm, repression of the sternum, the descent of the ribs, narrowing of the chest," &c* It is curious to see that he makes the cubic space of the thorax diminish with the inter- costal spaces widening. Nor do we wonder at his observing, in his vivisections, a contrac- tion of both sets of these muscles, for he not only skinned his animals, but " cut down and destroyed the external layers of intercostals, to lay bare the internal layer.' "Besides lap- plied (says Haller) pain and fear, being more efficient than mere pain itself," by puncturing the diaphragm to cause dyspnoea! Under such circumstances — an animal tied down, divested of all superficial muscles, with a pierced chest, — in '" pain and fear," — and writhing under the scalpel,—producing tetanic convulsions, and then a death-like relaxation from syncope, — surely in such a condition the action of the respiratory muscles, so sensitive to the least mental emotion, could not well be determined. Although Haller appears positive, yet he concludes his controversy with a brilliant question,—a vivid picture of his master mind, — " Why has nature made two, rather than one set of intercostal muscles, if, indeed, the function of each is the same?"f Haller's views have, however, prevailed to this day, and are still taught in our schools. „ Some authors have assigned but little to these muscles, counting them as mere associate muscles; others, that they are "wholly and solely " to form the thoracic parietes ; others that they are rather movers of the spine. Dr. John Barclay, a standing authority, observes, that the supposition of the two sets being antagonists in their actionr " is now ob- solete," and must " have been formed by the very witchcraft of imagination, in defiance of all observation and experiment." % Lastly, Dr. Sibson has made a commu- * El. Phya. ib. p. 43. t Ib. p. 44. % Barclay « On Muscular Motion," 8vo. Ed. 1808, pp. 533, 534. nication upon this subject. He observes, that " the scaleni invariably act during the whole time of inspiration ;" and that the function of the intercostal muscles is complicated ; thus, " the external intercostals,between the thoracic set of ribs, are throughout inspiratory ; those portions between their cartilages are expiratory, between the diaphragmatic set of ribs they are inspiratory behind, expiratory to the side and in front, and between their cartilages they are inspiratory ; between the intermediate set of ribs they are for the most part slightly in- spiratory between the ribs, and expiratory in front between the cartilages." " The internal intercostals of the thoracic ribs are expiratory behind and inspiratory in front, if the ribs approach there, and are in- spiratory between the costal cartilages. Be- tween the diaphragmatic and intermediate set of ribs, and between the cartilages, they are thought expiratory"* From this view of Dr. Sibson's, we venture to gather, that different fibres of the same la3er of intercostal muscle have diametrically opposite actions. We do not understand upon what ground it can be demonstrated that one muscle having a given action between two ribs, shall, between the same ribs, and observing the same obliquity and same attachments, present a directly con- trary action; the conditions are the same, and therefore the action must be the same. These views, however, of Dr. Sibson, in the paper in question, are not borne out by the narra- tion of any experimental facts. Insufflation on the dead body is not the movement of inspiration in the living subject. It is better to assign to these muscles the terms of ele- vators or depressors of the ribs, instead of inspiratory and expiratory muscles. All these observers, as far as we have seen, pre-suppose that the 1st rib is fixed by the scaleni (this is the view now taught) ; and that according to the fixing of the 1st rib, all the intercostal muscles are either elevators or depressors of the ribs. It is curious to contemplate that, out of elements so few, two ribs and two muscles, opinions so contrary should be held with regard to the action of these muscles. They have nevertheless an action as definite as any other muscle in the body. We may here observe, that, although the chest is conical, the ribs segments of circles, and the spine mobile, yet treating them as planes and lines will not lead to error. Two parallel bars, rotating on a centre, will increase and decrease the perpendicular distance be- tween them ; so they will, if curved like the ribs. This we have determined by experiment. Although the rib has two movements, ele- vation and rotation, yet these are associates, and do not obstruct each other. We shall employ the same diagrams as used by Dr. Barclay, when describing the same muscles. The intercostal muscles act as a force be- tween two moveable ribs or levers ; therefore let us consider — Tr. Phil., Pt. 4, 1846, pp. 543, 544.1047 THORAX. 1st. The movement of such levers, when rotating. 2nd. The effect of forces, oblique, perpen- dicular, and decussating, upon such levers. 1st. The movement of the levers. — Let fig. 677. a represent a series of parallel bars, Fie. 677. allowing of free rotation upon a rigid per- pendicular body a a ; let the free extremities of these bars be kept apart, so that the bars may at all times be parallel to each other. In this condition a certain distance exists between the bars, and a certain distance be- tween their free extremities and the perpen- dicular body a a. Let b represent the same bars moved into another position, resembling that of the ribs; in this position, the two conditions seen at a are altered. The perpendicular distances between the bars are diminished, and the distance between the free extremities of the bars and the body b b is likewise diminished. If the direction of this motion were still continued, the bars would ultimately touch each other, and their free extremities would be still nearer to the body b b. But let the bars be elevated, as in c c, and the same condition obtains as in the bars at b b, viz., they approximate each other, and the free ends come nearer to the body, c c. In this case the bars only have moved ; but the same effect can be obtained without moving the bars. Let A b {fig- 678.) be two bars at their maximum distance, while horizontal; at a b, and a' b', they have nearly attained their minimum perpendicular distances, though still hori- zontal, because the rigid bodies c c and c' c' have been moved respectively. Now, if we join these hree last figures into one, as in fig. 67 9., an then move the bars simulta- neously, some bars will approximate each other, whilst others will recede. The superior four are at their maximum perpendicular dis- tance from each other ; while the 4th, 5th, and 6[h are at a medium perpendicular dis- tance, and the 6th, 7th, and 8th bars at their minimum distance. The distances of these bars are regulated by the position of the rigid body representing the spine. If all of them were moved upwards Diagram representing the position of the ribs affected by the position of the spine. simultaneously, the first four would approxi- mate, whilst all the rest would recede from each other. Therefore the positions of the different parts representing the spine in fig. 679. command and regulate these changes. Fig. 679. Diagram as in fig. G78. with the three portions conjoined^ From this we learn, that the bars cannot rotate without changing their distances, and that when they are at 90° with reference to the body a a (fig. 677.), they are at their maximum distance from each other, and as they pass this position on either side, this dis- tance diminishes. In the human body the spine may represent the body to which the bars are attached (fig. 677.). The movement of the ribs will obey the same law in receding or approaching each other, and whether they increase or diminish their intercostal spaces, will depend upon the relation they bear to the spine. Fig. 682. is a cast, from a dissection of the thorax of a male subject, weight 107lbs., height 5ft. 4in. This correctly represents the natural position of the ribs, when the thorax is in a state of complete expiration, or with only the residual air in the lungs. The position of the 3x41048 THORAX. ribs is very oblique; the spine is curved ; therefore the relation of the ribs to the spine is different according to the curve, as are the bars to the body representing the spine {Jig. 679.). It will be seen that the inferior six or seven ribs are at a more oblique angle to the spine than the superior ribs. The spine does not curve sufficiently to bring the upper ribs to an angle of 90° with the spine; there- fore, if all the ribs were raised simultane- ously, they would all increase the breadth of their intercostal spaces, whilst their sternal end would recede from the vertebrae, and thus, by their elevation, the thoracic cavity would be enlarged, until they attained the angle of 90 ° to the spine. But if the elevation were carried beyond this point, the intercostal spaces would diminish, and thus the thoracic cavity would decrease. Fig. 684. is a pos- terior view showing the sloping position of the ribs more clearly. Now, if the spine were perfectly erect, the ribs would have a greater range, and consequently the upper ribs could be elevated higher, and thus still more increase the thoracic cavity. A man Fig. 680. Tliorax as at death. can expire a greater volume of air when perfectly erect, than in any other position. On the other hand, if we curve the spine, we limit the divergence of the ribs, because then we bring the ribs more into the po- sition of a b and a' b' (fig. 678.). Thus, in diseases of the spine, when angular cur- vature is extensive, the ribs are materially limited in their capability of increasing the perpendicular depth of their intercostal spaces, and consequently the perpendicular depth of the thorax. Fig. 666. is an instance of angular spine, reducing the ribs to their minimum distances without their moving. We have found by ex- periment, that the greatest volume of air which persons with angular spine can expire, is little more than equal to the volume of air of an ordinary respiration ; i. e. from 20 to 40 cubic inches, instead of 180 to 200 cubic inches. The following experiment proves that the ribs are all elevated when the chest is inflated, and that the spine is straightened. Into the thorax (Jig. 680. et seq.) we insufflated, or forced into the lungs 310 cubic inches of air, and a second cast was taken. The changed position of the ribs and spine is represented in figs. 681. 683. and 685. where it will be seen that all the ribs are raised ; their perpendicu- lar distances or intercostal spaces are all increased, and the spine is more erect. This experiment, therefore, demonstrates two things : 1st, that by artificially inflating the chest, the intercostal spaces are widened, and 2dly, that the spine becomes more erect. It is an experiment most unfavour- able for showing these two points, because the altered shape of the thorax by insufflation is not to be compared with the exceedingly enlarged condition produced by vital inspira- tion ; in which case the spine becomes more erect, and the intercostal spaces consequently wider. By placing the fingers in the inter- costal spaces of a living subject during deep inspiration and expiration, it may easily be perceived that in the former they widen, Tliorax artificially inflated with air. and in the latter they collapse. From 3000 observations we have found that, in deep in- spiration, the body becomes more erect, and less so in expiration. Insufflation is not the same, in effect, as inspiration. In the former we Jorce air into the chest, until the parts most yielding, as the diaphragm and abdominal parietes, are rendered so tense that their tension is suffi- cient to overcome the elastic force of the ribs, their cartilages, and the lungs ; then, and not until then, do we move the costal part of the thorax. On the other hand, in the living and deep inspiration, we lift the ribs and sternum, the most unyielding portions, first. These solely produce the threatened vacuum which inflates the lungs, whilst very little, if any, is accomplished by the diaphragm. The following table shows the measure- ments of the thorax, when expanded by in- spiration and insufflation.THORAX. 1049 Fig. 682. Fig 683. Thorax as at death. Thorax artificially inflated with air.

It should be constantly borne in mind, that to increase or diminish an intercostal space is to elevate or depress the ribs, and that to elevate or depress the ribs is to increase or diminish their intercostal spaces: the one cannot be accomplished without the other. Some au- thors have spoken of these as distinct; thus, that in inspiration the superior ribs ap- proximate each other, whilst they are raised, or that their rising or falling does not neces- sarily involve an increase or diminishing of the intercostal spaces ; but these two changes are simultaneous and cannot be done sepa- rately. 2nd. The effect of tensions, oblique, perpen- dicular, and decussating, between the moveable levers or ribs.—We employ a strip of vul- canised Indian-rubber for a force representing muscular contraction. A strip of this sub- stance, of uniform thickness, \ of an inch broad and 10 inches long, increased its length, with an increasing weight, as follows : — Weight Fig. 686. Increased length of Indian rubber, gr. inches. 1287i A ounces. 1 + the pan holding the weight = 850gr. : 2 do. = 1725" | 4 do. = 2600 1 8 do. = 4350 If 16 do. = 7850 4 32 do. = 14850 12i 04 do. = 28850 28| Although not exactly in accordance with the law of perfect elasticity, yet it is roughly so and enough for our purpose, viz. the tension is greatest when most stretched, and weakest when least stretched, corresponding with muscular contraction. Let e e (Jig. 686.) be fixed, a b and c d two moveable bars as before, t an oblique tension ; if t shortens, it has been supposed that the two bars would assume the position of a b' and C D ; but not so : they both rise like a b" and c d" until the two bars touch each other.* If we prevent this touching of the two bars by a rigid link, like that on parallel rulers, placed as at s Jig. 687., then the tension will still raise the bars to o o'. In this experiment three circumstances may be noticed. 1st, that the bars have been elevated ; 2dly, that the perpendicular distance between them has been diminished ; and 3dly, that the tension t has been shortened in attaining the position o o'. Place the tension in a contrary direc- tion, as between the bars \' b' and c'd', and the bars are brought into a contrary position, — drawn downwards to o' o'". This can be * This appears to have been known to Hamberger; but the author of this article was not aware of it until four years after he first introduced this move- ment to notice. (See Med. Chirurg. Trans, vol. 29, p. 213.) It is certain that Bamberger's views were not taught in any physiological school in this coun- try, Germany, or France, nor noticed in any of our philosophical works. Effect of oblique tension on separate bars. demonstrated by a model, using a spring or Indian-rubber as the tension, and may be Fig. 687. explained as follows. Let a Jt,fg. 688., repre- sent one bar, c d the perpendicular fixed body; b is the free extremity of the bar; k an axis from which a parallel bar has been re- moved. Let e, i, and o be other fixed points ; connect e to b by an elastic tension, and the bar b will be moved towards e. Let the ten- sion be fixed at i or o, still the bar b will be raised towards the respective points. Let the tension be fixed at k (the centre of mo- tion of the bar which we suppose is removed), and still the bar a b will be raised upwards towards k, and assume the position of a b, k l (fig. 689.) atM. But it is not necessary to this that the elastic force should extend from1051 THORAX. Fig. 688. Fib. 690. k to l in order to produce this motion : half of it might be wood, bone, or iron, provided the other half retained its elastic power. The effect would be the same, and the bar a b at N would be elevated by the tension between t l, Fig. 689. connecting the fixed point k with l by the rigid body k t. It is the omission of the fulcrum k, in calculating such oblique forces, which has hitherto obscured the explanation of the intercostal muscles. This may be illustrated in another way (fig. 690.). Let a b and CD represent bars as before upon \c ; t' the tension ; let c d and a c be fixed ; withdraw the pin at a, and the bar a b is drawn forwards into the position b', and the tension t becomes perpendicular to the two bars. On the other hand, reverse the experiment, as in Jig. 691.; supposing c d and the perpendicular body c a fixed, withdraw the pin at a, and the bar a b is drawn backwards to b'. This presupposes the bars kept apart, ~ i l_J otherwise the free bar would approximate the fixed bar c d. Therefore, one fulcrum is pushed upon by one bar, and pulled upon by the other. If the bars were kept fixed, and the body re- presenting the spine was left free, the tension would draw this last mentioned body into the Fig. 691. r i —.. S3 B lZ. • 1 •A —»-7) position of c c and c' c'fig. 678. Therefore, the element of the two fulcra is the chief agent for directing their upward or downward move- ment, under an oblique tension. If we arrange two bars with one fulcrum {fig. 692.), and allow Fig. 692. IB Id the tension to act as before, then the effect is only to draw the two bars together, as o b and o'd (fig. 693.). If we have an arrange- ment to substitute two fulcra at a a'fig. 692. and withdraw the centre fulcrum, then the two bars rise as before. Fig. 693. Now we shall suppose the bars at an angle of 90° to the body representing the spine. A perpendicular tension (l o,fig. 69-i.) ad- mits, of course, of no variation ; oblique ten- sions admit of two variations :1052 THORAX. a, obliquity in contrary directions. b, degrees of obliquity in each direction. Fig. 694. The perpendicular tension (l o, fig. 694.) produces but one effect, that of approxi- mating the two bars a c and b d, because the force of l o is acting upon a l and b o, levers of the same length, their movements being the same they would meet in the middle dis- tance at s. But if the bars are kept parallel by a rigid link like s, Jig. 687. the perpendicular ten- sion would produce no apparent effect upon the two bars. They might be rotated in any direc- tion, and the tension would remain of the same length ; for example, in Jig. 695. let t 2 be the perpendicular tension between the bars a b c d, move the bars to s or s', and the ten- sion is the same length, k k k, &c, may represent different places in the rotation, at each of which the tension t or k is the same length, although the bars at s, t 2, and s' are at different perpendicular distances from each other. A rigid connective, as wood or wire, may be substituted for the tension, an- this will equally allow of the bars being rod tated, and consequently changing their per- pendicular distances to each other. Hence it will be seen, that each of the lines k k k, are of the same length, although the two se- micircular lines describing the revolution of the bars are constantly changing in their re- lative distance to each othe We then seer, the possibility of having a rigid body connect- ing two bars, which shall nevertheless recede and approximate each other. From this we may gather, that though the sternum is rigid, and the cartilages, perhaps, ossified, the ribs may nevertheless maintain the capability of altering the breadth of their intercostal spaces. Perpendicular tension, therefore, like l o, (parallel to a b,) cannot rotate the bars, be- cause they never change their length. All tensions are oblique which have one of their attachments nearer to the spine than the other, therefore, in Jig. 694., l k and l t are oblique tensions. An oblique tension, hence, is acting on bars at dissimilar distances from their fulcra ; thus in Jig. 696., Fig. 695. Diii/ram showing that perpendicular fibres nevei alter their length. Fig. 696. / -A tension t' is oblique to the line a a, and the points on the lines ob, ad, to which the tension t' is attached, is represented by the lines a m and A M. And the law of action of such tension is, that it tends to move both bars or ribs towards that fulcrum which is near- est to one of its attachments. Therefore ten- sion l k (fig. 694.) would rotate the bars towards b, and tension L t towards A. The force of a given oblique tension between such bars is modified by two circumstances, — by the degree of obliquity, and by the obliquity of the bars in reference to the body which re- presents the spine. Of the degree of obliquity of a tension. — Let fig. 697. a b, c d, represent bars as before, the different connecting lines tensions of different degrees of obliquity, but of the same power of tension, l K is perpendicular, and has no rotating power. l k1 possesses a certain amount of power, l k2 more power, and l a the maximum power, or the power of rotating1053 THORAX. Fig. 697 the bars increases with the increasing obliquity of these tensions. By experiment we found that equal tensions at the following angles, pro- duced the following difference of power in rotating the bars : — Table H. — Power gained by a given Tension, as an intercostal Muscle, in relation to its Obliquity. Angle of tensioD. Tension. Resistance. At 90° 2-5 0 „ 75° 2-5 1-50 „ 46° 2-5 2-25 „ 15° 2-5 4-25 „ 7° 2-5 5-50 The power descreases as the tension ap- proaches the perpendicular l k', and increases as it approaches l a ; this is the maximum point: if the tension be attached to the body e e, either above a or below it, the system is changed into that of a single lever. From this we gather, that the power of an intercostal muscle, as an elevator and depressor of the ribs, increases with its obliquity; and that this movement entirely depends upon its obliquity. This is the only instance in the body where the power of a muscle increases with its obliquity. Of the obliquity of the ribs or bars with re- ference to the spine.— A given tension, say at the angle of 45°, will, when the lever is at 90° to the spine act more powerfully than when the lever is at an angle similar to that of the ribs. We found by experiment, that the bars in the following positions required an increased power to sustain them. The tension being uniform, and the resistance to be overcome acting from the same point. This gain of power is dependent upon the obliquity of the bars and change in the direc- tion of the tension, for in each of these posi- tions the tension was maintained the same. But if the tension be not kept uniform, still the resistance is increased as the bars rise ; thus, if the bars are at the angle of 50° {fig. 699. ?)(") somewhat similar to the position of the ribs, and these under a certain tension allowed to resist a power of 4, when they are moved upwards to 90°, through which revolution the tension has kept diminishing (because it has kept shortening), it will resist a power of 5. In this we see a beautiful compensation to the muscular contraction, viz. that while an in- tercostal muscle is losing power as it con- tracts, this loss is made up by the change in position of the ribs. We feel conscious that we can exert a retaining power at the ter- mination of a deep inspiration as great, if not greater, than at any other intermediate posi- tion of the ribs, at all of which the muscular power actually exerted is greater. All these remarks apply equally if the spine be curved ; for change of obliquity of the ribs, or change of curvature of the spine to the ribs, is the same thing. Table I. — Change of Power, from the Obli- quity of Bars or Ribs to the Spine. Angles of the Bars with the Body representing the Spine. Tension. Resistance. 30° 2-5 4 60° 25 12 90° 2-5 22 120° 2-5 33 Of oblique tensions in contrary directions. — We have shown that an oblique tension between parallel levers moves them in a cer- tain course. Now it is evident that tension in a contrary direction (all other things remain- ing the same) must likewise move such levers in a contrary direction. This is so clear that although Haller asserted absolutely that cross- ing muscles have the same action, yet he was not comfortable under such an opinion, " for,' ' says he, " why do they cross?" We have shown that a tension in the di- rection of L t fig. 694., will raise the bars, and one in the direction of L k will depress them; they are, therefore, antagonistic forces, and when the tensions are similar, they pro- duce an equilibrium of contrary force. If the bars a b, c d, {fig. 676.) be rotated, the lines will have directions contrary to each other, and will lengthen and shorten inversely to each other. Thus of the crossing tensions (fig. 676.) v d and v' b, v' b becomes short- ened to n b', and v d, on the contrary, becomes lengthened to n b'; and on the other side of 90°, v d is shortened to s d, and v' b lengthened to s' b. Therefore muscles circum- stanced like the intercostals and crossing each other, or observing contrary directions to each other, cannot be associates in action, for when one contracts, the other must relax, as the ribs move. We represent this more clearly in fig. 698. where a b and c d represent bars as before, rotating upon e/ e, and t f two ten- sions in contrary directions. As the bars are raised towards m, t' lengthens, and if depressed towards m' it shortens, while t lengthens to- wards n, and shortens towards n'. We re- present the tensions / t, &c, and ? t', &c, by the white lines, in the different positions they would assume if the two bars were rotated to those places in the half cir- cle. It will likewise be observed, that while either tension gradually lengthens or shortens, the two bars pass through their maximum perpendicular distance from each other at b d, on either side of which they attain their minimum distance. Therefore, if we examine tension t at n', the bars w ould there be closer to each other than they are at b d ; nevertheless, this tension in ascending must contract while the bars are increasing their perpendicular distances as they move to b d ; beyond which the tension still1054 THORAX. shortens, while the bars now decrease their perpendicular distance. Therefore it is per- fectly compatible for an intercostal fibre to separate the two ribs, between which it is at- tached, by its contracting ; and, if above a certain point (90° to the spine), to approxi- mate the same ribs by its further contraction. Fig. 698. In deep inspiration it will be found that the ribs increase the breadth of their intercostal spaces (as was mentioned years ago by Ham- berger) ; and that by the contraction of an intercostal fibre. The bars (Jig. 698.) in ro- tating, twice attain a minimum, and once a maximum, distance from each other; while the oblique tension in that revolution once attains its maximum, and once its minimum length. Of tensions at different parts of the bars or ribs. — Parallel tensions of equal power pro- duce the same effect, whether near the ful- crum or more distant from it ; an intercostal fibre near the vertebrae, has the same power as a fibre near the anterior extremity of the ribs. Let Fig. 696. represent ribs as before, with two parallel tensions at different distances from the body, e e, then i' + AM—t' +a »!=/'+jt(am—am)=?+A o t + an — t+a 7t=t+(A N—an)= t + A O. Therefore the tension l t (Jig. 694.) acts with the same power as tensions p p', which is much nearer to the fulcra a b. Knowing now the effect of a single oblique tension, it is easy to consider an indefinite number of tensions, for they follow the same law of action. In Jig. 699. the tensions x acting on AC, lift Fig. 699. the bars to in', and, by the same reason, ten- tions observing a contrary direction and acting upon a' c' lift the bars to m'". Therefore tensions, although observing contrary direc- tions, may be made to conspire to the same action, and may therefore be associates when acting upon different fulcra. We have shown that tensions in contrary directions, but acting upon the same fulcra, are antagonists. If we join the levers (fig. 699.) and increase their number, we may represent the thorax as in Jig. 700., k k representing the spine, b b the sternum, the bars a a the ribs, and the bars a' a' the costal cartilages united to the bars representing ribs by a movable joint; let r represent the external intercostals, these, we know, will act as elevators, while those at h, representing the internal intercostals, are asso- ciates in action, although they observe a con- trary direction, because they act upon the fulcra in b b; in fact, they are elevators of the levers representing the cartilages. What now is the combined action of a series of two such tensions ? The whole body of levers will be raised, and the part b b re- presenting the sternum will have two motions : it will be raised and moved forwards into the position of b' b'. This is precisely the mo- tion of the sternum in deep inspiration. In a model of this kind, certain means must be used to limit the motion, or the movement is continued until the tensions are at rest. Or, if the bars representing the ribs a a (fig. 700.) be fixed, then the tensions representing the internal intercostals h would depress the short bars representing the car- tilages, because b b is free, and k k is fixed. And were either set of tensions continued over the joints representing the union of the cartilages with the ribs, such fibres would1055 THORAX. antagonise each other. In nature the external intercostals are not continued over to the in- tercartilaginous spaces. Fig. 700. In this model all the ribs are elevated with- out the first bar being drawn up by any ten- sion representing the scalenii muscles. In fact the fulcra are the fixed points ; therefore there are here six fixed points for the tensions to act upon, and hence each row of oblique tensions acts quite independently. This application of force and disposition of the bars representing the ribs is after the manner of that great engine of power the "genou lever." (Vide Potter's Mechanics.) Tensions in the first space (Jig. 700.) act with a greater power in pushing out the body b than do the tensions in the 5th space; but, on the other hand, the motion is less in the 1st than in the 5th space. It will also be seen that these six bars, though moving all equally, will produce an unequal effect upon the body b b, forcing out the lower end more than the upper end. The ribs of man, in the same manner, increase in their length from the 1st to the 8th, and, therefore, by an equal mobility, an unequal protrusion of the sternum is produced, advancing the lower end more than the upper end. We have reason to believe that the mobility of all the ribs is the same, and that it is by their different lengths that the different degrees of protrusion of the anterior part of the thorax may be accounted for. Having investigated the effect of artificial tensions acting on bars made to represent the ribs, we can now return to the consider- ation of the action of the direct respiratory muscles. Actionof the intercostal muscles (resumed).— The intercostales exlerni are all elevators of the ribs. Inspiratory muscles. They separate the ribs in the act, and they can do this indepen- dently of any other muscle fixing the first rib. The intercostales intend have a double action. All those portions between the ribs depress the ribs and are expiratory muscles; they also approximate the ribs and in every way an- tagonise the external intercostal muscles. Those portions between the costal cartilages are elevators of the cartilages, and associates with the external intercostals, and, thence, in- spiratory muscles. These muscles also can act independently of any other muscle fixing the first or last rib. The intercostal muscles being antagonists, they yield to each other, the same as any other flexor yields to an extensor muscle. We possess a perfect and definite command over the ribs, and can stop their respiratory movements at any stage of breathing, more readily than we can those of the diaphragm. It is necessary to healthy breathing that we should raise all the ribs ; they are there- fore all mobile, and all their intercostal spaces are increased in their perpendicular distance during inspiration, and diminished during ex- piration. II. Levatorcs costarum (Lcvatores breviores costarum, Alb.).—These are narrow, tendinous, and fleshy fasciculi (Jig. 672.) covering the pos- terior end of the rib, and extending obliquely downwards and forwards, in the same di- rection as the external intercostals. Their superior attachment is to the extremities of the transverse processes of the dorsal ver- tebrae ; their inferior to the margins of the ribs between their angles and tubercles. These fibres spread out and become flat at their insertion. Each rib receives one from the vertebra next above; there are therefore twelve muscles on each side ; and that for the first rib is derived from the last cervical vertebra. The inferior muscles of this series divide into two parts ; one of which is distri- buted as above stated ; but the other, consist- ing of longer fibres, passes over one rib and te-r minates on the second below ; and thus each of the lower ribs receives muscular fibres from the transverse processes of two vertebras. The long bands have been described as separate muscles under the name levatores longiores costarum (Albinus). Action. —The same as the external inter- costals. Elevators of the ribs and inspi- ratory muscles. Acting directly upon their fulcra, the transverse processes of the ver- tebra;. III. Triangularis sterni (Sterno-costalis, Ver- heyen). — A thin flat plane of muscular and tendinous fibres (Jig. 674.) placed within the thorax, immediately behind the costal carti- lages. This muscle is attached to the inner surface of the ensiform cartilage, lower part of the sternum, and the cartilages of the lower true ribs. From these origins its fibres pass laterally along the inner walls of the thorax, diverging upwards, horizontally, and down- wards, and are attached by digitations (which give to the outer margin a serrated appear- ance) into the cartilages, lower border, and inner surface, of each of the true ribs, from the 5th to the 2nd inclusive. Action. — This muscle varies considerably in the extent and points of its attachment in different bodies, and even in the opposite sides of the same body. Hence, it aids in drawing down and drawing up (according to the di-1056 THORAX. rection of its fibres) the ribs. It may be said to be both inspiratory and expiratory. IV. Infra-costales (Verheyen).—In connec- tion with the inner surface of the ribs {fig. 673.) several small bundles of fleshy and tendinous fibres, which are thus named, will be found ex- tending over two, and in some instances over three, intercostal spaces. They have the same direction with the internal intercostals, and are (properly) often described as parts of those muscles. The fasciculi vary in size and number, and may be found on any of the intercostal spaces, except, perhaps, the first; but they are most constant on the lower ribs. Action. — The same as the costal portion of the internal intercostals, depressors of the ribs and expiratory muscles. Of the elasticity of the ribs.— Elasticity depends upon reaction, and restores in a contrary direction the force which have been impressed ; the effect produced is com- mensurate with the amount of the cause, and the reaction can never take place so long as the cause continues to be applied ; but immedi- ately that cause ceases, the elasticity comes into action. Inspiration is performed by the true inspi- ratory muscles, and expiration, by the expira- tory muscles, and the elasticity of the ribs and their cartilages, together with the elasticity of the lungs. We find a broad difference manifested between the inspiratory and ex- piratory power (Table R.),the latter exceed- ing former by about one third. This differ- ence is due to the elasticity of the ribs and lungs associating their power with the ex- piratory muscles. The combined elastic power is very great; we have examined it in two fa- vourable cases, an hour after death, when the bodies had not fallen one degree in temperature. X. H., a young man, slightly built, erect and well formed, aet. 22, weight 9ist., height 5ft. 10in., vital capacity 235 cubic inches. The absolute capacity of his chest was 248 cubic inches ; internal area 256in.; circumfe- rence of the chest, over the nipples, in the or- dinary state, alive 33 inches, dead 30i inches. After death we forced air into his lungs, whilst the temperature of the body was still at 97°. The force resisting the introduction of this air must havebeen due to the elasticity of the ribs and their cartilages, together with that of the lungs. By an arrangement, we could force in different quantities of air, and measure the collapsing power of the elastic parts, through the medium of the confined air pressing upon a column of mercury: the following was the result: — Table K. — Costal elastic Collapse. X H. Inch of cub. in. mercury. Air forced in 70 Resisting elasticity T20 Ditto 90 ditto 1'25 Ditto 160 ditto 2-50 We could not force in more air, for with this pressure it was impossible to prevent the air escaping with great rapidity through the ne- cessary wounds. This experiment was re- peated three times with the same result. It will be remembered that X. H. had drawn into his lungs, when alive, 75 cubic inches of air more than we could force in, after death. If, therefore, 160 cubic inches pro- duced a collapsing elastic force equal to 2-5 we may suppose that 235 cubic inches would produce an elastic force equal to not less than 3*9 in. of mercury. This chest, mea- suring 256 superficial square inches, it fol- lows that X. H., in breathing out 235 cubic inches of air, with no more sensible effort than that of a mere sigh, had to overcome with his inspiratory muscles a gross elas- tic resistance of about 499lbs., and with a force equal to this weight would the thoracic walls recoil for expiration upon the air in his lungs. N. C, height 5ft. 8in., weight lOst. 10lb., set. 21: vital capacity, 200 cubic inches; ab- solute capacity, 245 cubic inches; superficial measurement of the entire thoracic cavity, 256 square inches ; circumference of the chest, alive, 33 inches, dead, 34J. Temperature of the body, when examined, 97° F. Tempera- ture of the air forced into the lungs, 63° F. This man was what is termed " thick set," firm, erect, and well built, a porter by trade, a very different case from the former. The fol- lowing was the elastic power of his ribs : — Table L. — Costal Collapse in N. C. Inch of cub. in. mercury. Air forced in 70 Resisting elasticity TOO Ditto 90 ditto 1-50 Ditto 180 ditto 3"25 Ditto 200 ditto 4-50 The first ninety inches of air introduced ruptured the lungs ; therefore the elasticity of the lungs did not interfere with our experi- ments. In both cases this resistance must be referred only to the ribs, their cartilages and ligamentous attachments ; also, in both cases, the bodies were kept erect, or in the sitting posture ; this should be attended to, for the mere weight of the body upon the ribs when recumbent would increase their collapsing power. These tables express a dead power al- ways in reserve, equally powerful whether we are in robust health, or emaciated by age or disease. Dead or alive, this is ready to be put into force; and, in fact, it is never at rest, never at zero, until death ; we may even go farther, and say, not until de- composition has weakened the collapsing ten- sion of these parts. Cut through a costal cartilage, or take out a small portion of the sternum, say corresponding to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th intercostal spaces, and the opening by the elasticity of parts will retract, and we never can restore them again to their original fit, because the thoracic parietes are still not at rest. The bony cage-work of the chest isTHORAX. 10.57 so tightly knitted together, that at its mini- mum contraction there still remains an elastic force in operation. In fact we might expect this, because the respiratory movements are so small that it is necessary that an extensive elastic power should be ready at all the re- spiratory stages; and therefore the parts are upon the stretch before we begin to inspire in order to increase to the geometrical degree re- quired, of two, three, or four pounds to the inch, by a very limited movement, which would not be the case did we begin to in- spire when the thoracic boundaries were at zero, at least, if it did, the walls, &c, would have to be much stronger. Supposing inspiration to be the result of muscular force equally distributed over the whole thorax, the inspiratory power is easily calculated. Taking the walls of the chest at 206 superficial inches, and the area of the diaphragm as 51 superficial inches, and placing them separately, it would appear as follows:— Table M. — Inspiratory Muscular Power re- quired to overcome Costal Elasticity, mea- sured by the Insufflation of 200 Cubic Inches of Air.

Yet, on the other hand, in life a greater expansion w ould be produced by the ribs, and thence a greater resistance. It may be questioned how far we are entitled to add a resistance as due to the dia- phragm. But let us suppose a thoracic cavity collapsed to rest, with a fleshy floor or dia- phragm also quiescent ; let us ' suppose the ribs expanded by some power from without; the air within the chest would be attenuated, and the diaphragm would be forced upwards, by atmospheric pressure, with a force exactly commensurate to the rarefaction of the air within the chest (presupposing that no air is allowed to enter the chest when we expand the ribs). In this case the diaphragm is resisting the same force per inch as the walls of the chest. Or on the other hand, fill the chest with air to perfect distension, allow the ribs to collapse, the diaphragm would have to resist this collapse with a power exactly commensurate with the recoiling elasticity of VOL. tv. the ribs ; therefore the diaphragm participates, in common, in such resistances in the tho- racic cavity. But, as the question may be open to objection, we shall chiefly notice that power in reference to the parietes of the chest, given in the 3d and 4th columns in the last table. This table shows that the man, when alive, exerted a muscular power with the walls of the chest, when he inspired 200 cubic inches of air, equal to a total weight of 451'9 lbs. avordupois. Independently of the collapsing elasticity of the lungs, which would be not less than 128 lbs. more (see Table O), his inspiratory muscles lifted a weight of 32 stones, — a weight which he could not have lifted with his arms : and yet the animal economy is not conscious of this exertion. We have supposed a uniform mus- cular traction, which is not the case, because the distribution of muscular fibre and tho- racic mobility, is not equally applied in ex- panding the chest. In diagram fig. 670, d represents a section of the thorax: the portion shaded is the range of thoracic mobility be- tween extreme inspiration and expiration. The mobility is unequal ; more is on the anterior than on the posterior part; therefore we may presume muscular traction to be more at one part than at another. This man could exhale 300 cubic inches of air ; and there is every reason to think, from this extensive mobility, according to our last estimate, that the elastic collapse of his ribs, at the termina- tion of deep inspiration, would be not less than 1000 lbs. In the superficial measurements of the thorax we have included every part, even that covering the vertebra?. Now certainly we cannot think the elastic collapse over the vertebra? equal to that from the sternum ; therefore, if we allow one-third of the chest to be inactive, and the remainder elevated by the respiratory muscles (which we think is within the mark, because every part of the chest is mobile), then in the case of N. C. in deep inspiration the muscles would have to overcome 301 lbs., or 23 ounces on the super- ficial square inch of the thorax. The last act of life is a deep expiration. During life the ribs are always kept under a certain degree of distension, which is ready to send out from 70 to 100 cubic inches of air at any moment {Reserve air, p. 1067). Our inspiratory muscles, in fact, are always antagonising an elastic thoracic collapse ; and this is al\va3's increasing or decreasing, ac- cording to the stage of respiration, as quiescent or forced, &c. There are cases, as in hang- ing, where a man may die, at the moment of full inspiration, from fear, making an effort to resist the dreaded shock which he is about to receive. N. C. died thus in a state of inspira- tion. Making allowance for unequal elasticity of the boundaries of the thorax, of £ as above stated, it may be safely said that the dif- ferent stages of respiration or breathing re- quire the follow ing muscular power to antago- nise the elastic power of the ribs throughout life. 3 YTHORAX. 1058 Table N. — Inspiratory Muscular Tower (corrected).

This is to be lifted 18 or 20 times every minute of our life. Of the Elastic Power ok the Lungs. — Independently of the powerful collapse of the ribs and their cartilages, expiration is greatly aided by the elasticity of the lungs themselves, which at all times, and in all the stages of respiration, are tending to collapse upon themselves ; and hence, immediately upon puncturing the thorax, the lungs col- lapse to half their dimensions. From the earliest period of physiological re- search, as usual, totally opposite opinions have alternately prevailed as to whether the lungs themselves are active in the respiratory move- ments. Averroes, Riolan, Planter, and Bre- mond*, were in favour of their independent action ; and Bartholin, Diemerhoeck, Mayow, and Hallerf, opposed to it. Their elastic con- tractility can only have been lost sight of by reason of their quick contractible power ; for immediately the thorax is punctured, before parts are cleared away sufficiently to give a view of the contents of the thorax, the lungs have collapsed to their minimum, and a vast space is always presented between the lungs and the thoracic walls, which, by the old anatomists, even in the time of Hoadly (1740), was con- sidered to contain air necessary for respiration. Dr. Carson of Liverpool appears to have first noticed this elastic power of the lungs, lie judiciously observes : " Breathing is, in a great measure, the effect of this intermin- able contest between the elasticity of the lungs and the irritability of the diaphragm." J In his experiments upon the lungs of some lower animals (bullocks), he found a collapsing power equal to a column of from 12 to 18 inches of water; in a calf about 18 inches ; and in a dog about 10 inches. In these experiments, the lungs, when in situ, were inflated to their maximum. Pro- bably the ribs interfered by their resistance in aiding the collapse of the lungs. Never- * Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences, Paris, 1739; Midler, p. 346. + El. Phys. t. iii. 1. viii. p. 226. % Phil. Tr. 1820, part i. pp. 42,43. theless, at all times of inflation, even when the residual volume only was in the lungs, there was an elastic power in operation. Mr. Gulliver informs us, that from an examination of the lungs of man and the lower mammalia he has been led to infer that the elastic tissue is an important agent in expiration. This tissue, he says, may be seen to invest the entire surface of the lungs, forming a strong, elastic, though delicate, capsule to the organ. This investment of the lungs in the horse, he informs us, resembles the fibres of the ligamentum nuchas and the fibrous coat of the aorta of the ox, as depicted in Gerber's Anat. pp. 54, 55. The longitudinal fibres which enter into the structure of the air-tubes throughout their entire extent are very elastic, like the coats of the arteries, and these are justly supposed to possess the power of contracting each mi- nute ramification of the lungs. When this elastic power is at rest, and the lungs are col- lapsed to their minimum, no external pressure can discharge the remaining volume of air, because the very pressure, to accomplish this, compresses the exit tube in some part of its course. The elastic contraction of each tube acts somewhat like the vermicular motion of the intestines, causing a specific diminution of calibre upon each part of the column of air in a ramification, driving it forward. But when the elasticity has arrived at its mini- mum, and this tissue is quiescent, we cannot extract any more air from the lungs, because the vermicular expelling power derived from this elastic tissue ceases to act. The col- lapsing power of the lungs acts in the same di- rection as that of the ribs, but with less force. According to Tables O and P. the total elas- tic collapse of the male lung was equal to about 4301 grs. or nearly 10 oz. avoirdupois (9'8) upon the superficial square inch of that organ, and in the female about 5060 gr. or 11 3 oz. upon the superficial square inch. We think, taking all things into consideration, that it is safe to say, in making a deep inspiration for the vital capacity-volume, that we may estimate the elastic collapsing power of the lungs at one half lb. avoirdupois, per superficial square inch; therefore, allowing the mean superficial mea- surement of the male lung to be 300 in. and the female 247 in., that the grass resistance, by the elasticity of the lungs against the inspiratory muscles, would be in the male 150 lbs., and in the female 123 lbs. This is to be added to the elastic force of the ribs (Table N). In the female an unknown portion of the residual volume escaped before we could connect the haemadynamometer ; for the next volume added, of 90 cubic inches in the man with all his residual volume, the collapsing power was 7-2 in., and in the female, with the addition of 100 cubic inches, it was 5-5 in., which about makes up the difference of 2 in. of collapsing power lost by the accidental escape of the residual volume. In the case of two healthy persons ex- amined immediately after death,— E. F. M., male, height 5 ft. 9 in., weight 10 st. 10 lbs.,THORAX. 1059 3 v 2 circumference over the nipples, alive, 38 in.; dead, 36 in. — died with an expiration, — we, by means of the hasmadynamometer, contain- ing water, attached to the trachea, found, with different volumes of air in the lungs, the following elastic collapsing power (tem- perature— of body 98*5° Fahr. — of atmo- sphere 59-5u, barometer 29-753).

(+100 ditto) - 10-0 Vital capacity (+ 90 ditto) 20"0 At the commencement of "ordinary breath- ing" the collapsing power of the lungs in our experiment was 7'2 in., or nearly J- of a lb. per superficial square inch. This is a very notable power, not less in the gross, oftentimes, than 100 lbs. of dead uncounter- balanced resistance to the respiratory mus- cles. In the female, with nearly an arith- metical increase of 100 cubic inches per vo- lume, the collapsing power increases 5 to 10 and 20. The insufflated volume in the male being less regular, the collapsing power ma- nifested is also less regular. But, taking the mean resistance of the reserve and breathing volumes in the male combined (160 cub. in.), the power of collapse was 7-7 inches. In the female, the mean of nearly the same quantity of air in the lungs (within 10 cubic inches) allowing for little or no residual volume at the starting point when we inflated, is likewise 7-7 inches. We believe that the elastic power of the lungs in the two sexes is the same; — indeed why should it not be so? because the office of the elastic tissue is to drive out of the lungs volumes of air no longer required ; and it is probable that the resistance given by the air, against the sides of the air tubes, in both sexes, is the same; and unless the number and calibre of the air tubes are different, the resistance, by friction, to the elastic collapse of the lungs, from the trans- mission of similar volumes of air in the two sexes, must be the same. In three experiments we found the elastic collapse of the lungs cease at different degrees; i. e. different volumes of residual air were displaced when the elastic force had come to its minimum. * For definition of these terms see p. 1065.

We do not know what quantity of air remained after these volumes were displaced. When we ex- hausted the remainder of the residual volume, which is not affected by the elastic collapse of the lungs, the sides of the air tubes themselves collapsed by the atmospheric pressure. They likewise are elastic, but in a contrary direc- tion ; an expanding elasticity keeping them open. We found that the expanding elasticity acted so as to draw or suck inwards the air with the different powers represented by 7,1*5 and 12"5 inches of water in the haemadynamo- meter, when we attempted to withdraw out of the lungs more air than the lungs themselves naturally displace by their collapsing elasticity. Therefore these figures may represent the ex- panding elasticity of the air tubes. In these cases there is no apparent order ; but we learn the fact that such elasticity exists. In the case C there was a tubercular condition of lung, in the milliary form, in one apex; in H there was extensive pleuritic adhesions ; but in the case of M the lungs were remarkably healthy. It is interesting to notice that there are here two elasticities in contrary direc- tions,— an elastic collapse which has its limit at a certain point, and an elastic expansion of the air tubes, which likewise have their limit of expansion at the same point, protecting the calibre of the air tubes from any further collapse. In the case of M the expansion of the air tubes was equal to 12-5 inches of water; by calculation it appears that the collapse of the elastic tissue upon the vital capacity volume would be about 14 inches. These antago- nistic forces are quite independent of the will, or any nervous stimuli: one is for maintain- ing an expiratory current of air, and the other for preserving an open channel in the lungs for inspiration. The lungs are very delicate organs, and can resist but little artificial force ; for, if once inflated to the ordinary state of either the breathing volume or vital capacity volume, they do not appear able to collapse again to their original size ; — probably intra-lobular emphysema is produced. In our experiments we forced air into the lungs; they were expanded because we inflated them. We now think it would be better to10G0 THORAX. t Stat., vol. i. p. 267. H. i. S. 40. 8vo, 1848. inflate them by expanding them (removing the external atmospheric pressure), and allow the air to drop into the air vesicles by its own gravitation (as in living respiration), when they would in all probability collapse freely to their original position. When they are in- flated by expansion (the natural way of life) the delicate cells of the lungs can safely resist a force of from 3 to 9 inches of mercury, or from 40 to 121 inches of water (see next column) ; but when expanded by inflation, their collapsing power was damaged so that it could sustain only 17 or 20 inches of water. This is worthy of notice in resuscitating the apparently asphyxiated person, at which times we have long been of opinion that bellows and pumps are highly dangerous instruments to use for maintaining artificial respiration. Of the muscular contractility of the lungs. — In the trachea transverse muscular fibres extend across posteriorly, connecting the tips of the incomplete rings of cartilage. In the smaller bronchi they encircle the whole tubes, and there appears to be little doubt but that these circular fibres are to be found in every part of the air tubes as far as the terminal air vesicles. Physiologists have disputed whether these fibres are muscular or not; if muscular, they are important agents in respiration, acting as a series of little expiratory muscles. Dr. C. J. B. Williams lately read a paper at the meeting of Glasgow (September 1840), upon the subject.* He experimented upon the lungs of some of the lower animals, — several dogs, a rabbit, a bullock, a horse, &c, — as soon as possible after death, submitting their lungs to galvanic stimuli, and securing a hacmadynamometer with a stop-cork to the trachea. He found that, upon applying this stimulus, the fluid in the bent tube rose from 1 to 2 inches, and it immediately fell on break- ing contact. This effect could only be pro- duced by muscular contraction. Kolliker, a very accurate observer, confirms these views.-)- He found in man, in the larger and finer bronchial tubes, a coat formed of annular fibres, in one or more layers according to the size of the tube, consisting of unstriped muscular fibres ; and over this coat a thin layer of fibro-cellular tissue with nucleus-fibres. He found no mus- cular fibres directed longitudinally. He ob- serves, " In former observations I thought I had convinced myself of the existence of unstriped muscular fibres in the air-cells; but in my resumed examination of the lungs of man and mammalia, I can with certainty see nothing distinctly characteristic as such mus- cular tissue." Our knowledge of these cir- cular muscular fibres was first chiefly derived from the researches of Reisseissen. Laennec considered spasmodic asthma to be assignable * The Pathology and Diagnosis of Diseases of the Chest, 8vo. by Dr. C. J. B. Williams, 1840, Lou- don, p. 320. t Beitriige zur Kenntniss der glatten Muskeln in the Zeitschrift fur Wissenschal'tliche Zoologie. to a spasm of these circular fibres. We are as yet ignorant of the possible extent of contrac- tion of these fibres. The discharge of air is paramount, and that from the most remote vesi- cle ; and we know that by no mechanial means can we obtain this, and therefore a molecular power is necessary, which we readily imagine can be obtained by these tissues acting so as to give a peristaltic motion, and thus dis- placing from every individual vesicle the de- licate stream of air necessary to be dis- charged. We do not need these tissues for inspiration, because the atmosphere, by its mere weight, can penetrate into the most remote air-cell, overcoming all the friction against the sides of the air-tubes. The in- spiratory volumes of air are but for one pur- pose, to aerate the blood ; but the expiratory volumes are for the voice and other purposes sometimes requiring great force to aid in cer- tain expulsive efforts. Of Respiratory Muscular Power.— Young falls into an error in supposing " that in muscles of the same kind the strength must be as the number of fibres, or as the extent of the surface which would be formed by cutting the muscle across ; and it is not improbable that the contractile force of the muscles of a healthy man is equivalent to about 500 lbs. for every square inch of the section." * When we examine men we find no such calculations are to be relied upon. It is very common to find two men of cor- responding dimensions produce very different effects upon any dynamic instrument. The respiratory power may or may not cor- respond with the general development of mus- cular force. We have submitted 1.500 men of various classes to an experiment upon the inspiratory and expiratory power. The resistance to this power was a column of mercury,—thekesmady- namometer, or bent tube, first used by Dr. Hales. He observes, " A man, by a peculiar action of his mouth and tongue, may suck mercury 22 inches, and some men 27 or 28 inches, high ; yet I have found by experience that, by the bare inspiring action of the dia- phragm and dilating thorax, I could scarcely raise the mercury 2 inches." -f- Hales appa- rently never tested the expiratory power. We connected the column of mercury with the index on a dial plate, which represented the inches and tenths of inches of mercur}' lifted. A tube was adapted to fit the nostrils through which the inspiratory or expiratory effort was made. By the former the index was moved in one direction, and by the latter in the con- trary direction; each half of the dial plate representing, respectively, inspiratory and ex- piratory power, with expressive words at- tached, as follow: — (See top of next page.) It will be observed that the figures on each side of the same word differ in their value, those of the expiratory side ranging about one- third higher than those on the inspiratory side. * See Nat.

We subjoin the following table of the result of these cases. (Table S.) To illustrate one of the points so striking in these experiments (viz., the difference be- tween the inspiratory and expiratory power), we refer to diagram 701., which represents by curves their relative position. The upper line is the expiratory power, and the double line below, the inspiratory power. The per- pendicular lines are the different heights of the cases examined. The position of these curved lines indicates the power they re- present, — the higher the curve the greater the power. The two rows of figures at the bottom are the inches and tenths of inches of mercury elevated. (I. for inspiration, and E. for expiration.) According to this, at the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and 5 feet 8 inches, the inspiratory power is greatest, and thence the inspiratory power gradually decreases as the stature increases. The men of 5 feet 7 inches and 8 inches elevate a column of 3 inches of mercury: this may be considered a healthy power ; and the men of G feet high elevate about Scinches of mercury as their healthy power.

It may be asked, why connect this with the height? Because it was found in six collateral observations that this was the only physical condition which presented a relation so as to throw the experiments into an or- derly position.* By Table S we see that the respiratory power varies in different classes. The "gentlemen," for instance, are below most of the other classes : at the height of 5 feet 8 inches, they elevate by inspiration 2'35 inches of mercury. This may account for the fact why Dr. Hales could only raise 2 inches of mercury by this effort. The expiratory power is normally more irregular — more apt to vary — than the inspi- ratory power. The expiratory muscles par- ticipate in other duties besides that of mere expiration ; the vocation of the glass-blower, the trumpeter, the wrestler, the jeweller (blow-pipe), and the sailor, especially call these muscles into use, increasing their na- tural power. They thus oftentimes become excessively strong. The inspiratory muscles are exclusively for supplying us with air, in which act they have only to oppose the uniform resistance of elasticity. The inspira- tor!/ power is therefore the best indication of the "health"— the " vis vitce." As an instance of the effect of vocation chang- * For the other observations, see p. 1068, and Med. Chir.

The inspiratory power of these two classes is nearly equal, whilst the expiratory power of the Thames police exceeds that of the Metropolitan police,— the former using their upper extre- mities, whilst the latter use their lower ex- tremities most : — the former chase the thief by the use of the oar ; the latter by the swiftness of their legs. Compositors and pressmen stand low the former are the lowest in their respiratory power ; the pressmen are much higher. The order in which some of these classes come is as follows : — the most powerful are the Thames police ; next, the sailors ; the pau- pers and the gentlemen are nearly equal ; and lastly, diseased cases. The two last lines is the mean of the four healthiest classes, —. the seamen, firemen, Thames police, and pugilists : their maximum is 3 inches; the mean of the whole classes together is little more than 2± inches. The measure of this power when expressed by inches of mercury appears small, yet, when bydrostatically con- sidered, it is verygreat. Men have wondered that they could not elevate more mercury in the tube; but all surprise vanishes when it is recollected, that, by the law of hydrostatics, when a column of 3 inches height of mer-10G2 THORAX. + CN - CN CN 1 ^ 1 CO 00 iO o •dxa 1 o o 00 CN 1- co O Tp 00 TJ< to 0 cp 1/5 to CO CO ? r c CO •dsui 1 ° o o CN CN CN TP ifj cb to CN to to j.

The column of mercury raised, therefore, will not safely serve to compare the respiratory power of men of different dimensions, for the area of the thorax must also be considered. For instance, we examined a man, 4 feet 7iinches high (circum- ference of the chest 29 inches), who raised 3M5 inches; and another man, 7 feet high (chest 50 inches in circumference), who could only elevate 3 inches of mercury: but the dissimilarity between the area of the dia- phragm in the dwarf and giant was such, that "the latter in reality lifted about 500 lbs., and the former only about 39 lbs. Suppose the base of his chest to be 57 superficial square inches ; had this man raised 3 inches of mercury by his inspiratory muscles, his diaphragm alone must have opposed a resist- ance equal to more than 23 oz. on every inch of that muscle, and a total weight of more than 83 lbs. Moreover, the sides of the chest, by attenuating the air within, resist an atmospheric pressure equal to the weight of a covering of mercury 3 inches in thick- ness, or more than 23 oz. upon every inch surface, which, if we take at 318 square inches, the chest would be found to resist a pressure of 713 lbs. ; and, allowing the elastic resistance of the ribs as 1| inch of mercury, this will bring the weight resisted by the inspiratory muscles of the thorax as follows: — Diaphragm 83 lbs. Walls of the chest - - 731 „ Costal resistance (elastic) - 232 „ Lung ... - 100 „ 1146 lbs. Or, in round numbers, we may say, that the inspiratory muscles of such a man of ordinary dimensions resisted 1000 lbs. This is a re- sistance not counterbalanced ; for were it counterbalanced, it would only be mere dis- placement. We have made a safe addition for the elasticity of the lungs. We think it may be confidently stated that nine-tenths of the thoracic surface conspire to this act, allowing the remainder to lie dormant. Although the difference between the in- spiratory and expiratory powers, when tested to their utmost, is so great, j et it must not be thought that these two powers are in their ordinary action so dissimilar; and indeed, when all things are considered, the question may still be asked, is the inspiratory or ex- piratory act the strongest? In the last table (Table S.) there is uniformly a difference, because the two [lowers are unequally taxed with resistance. All elastic force is co-ope- rating with the expiratory power, whilst it antagonises the inspiratory power; therefore all the power manifested in inspiration is muscu- lar ; but in expiration it is partly muscular and partly elastic power. This probably causes the great apparent difference between inspira- tion and expiration ; at least, if we separate the resistance we assign to the elasticity of the ribs and lungs from the expiratory power, we shall nearly equalise the two. This can be easily proved upon one's own person : — partially empty the chest of air ; then forcibly test your expiration upon the haemadynamometer: pro- bably you can only elevate the mercury 1£ inch; then inspire deeply, completely filling the lungs, and now test your expiratory power, — instead of 1| inch, it will probably be 5 inches. This difference appears due to two causes. 1st. In the deep inspiration the ribs are put more upon the stretch than in the moderate inspiration. 2d. The chest, when distended with air, presents points of attach- ment for muscular traction, to a greater me- chanical advantage. The most remarkable respiratory power, as tested by the haemadynamometer, was in the case of a Chatham recruit, who was fre- quently examined by Dr. Andrew Smith, on whose accuracy we place implicit confidence. The man's age was 18; height, 5feet 6inches, weight, 10 stones 5 lbs. ; circumference of his chest, 35 inches; vital capacity, 230; — his inspiratory power was equal to 7 inches of mercury, and his expiratory power to 9 inches ! The thoracic power of this man, according to our last calculation, was equal to a gross weight of 2200 lbs. This was the amount manifested, and we may safely consider 50 per cent, of muscular power to be lost by the obliquity of the respiratory muscles ; so that this man 2,ossessed a vital power equal to nearly 2 tons! He exhibited in no other respect any remarkable feature of strength. A dynamic instrument like the haemady- namometer would be useful to those whose duty it is to examine men for certain public services, as for the army, navy, police, fire- brigade, &c. With care, it w ould often detect disease. The efforts required to move the mercury test the whole trunk of the body. The inspiratory test produces a rarefaction of the air within the thorax, causing an extra (unbalanced) atmospheric pressure upon the body from without. In this way we have de- tected rupture of the membrana tympani; for the air rushing in by this opening equalised the difference otherwise produced. The ex- piratory test is of a contrary order, increasing the pressure from within; in this way we have detected hernia. The difference between the healthy and dis- eased respiratory powers is broadly marked.—. It is shown in the annexed diagram (Jig. 702.); the lower curve is the power manifested by diseased, and the upper curve that of healthy persons. The difference is about 50 per cent., because weakness is the most prominent sy mptom of disease. We do not compare the expiratory power for the reason already assigned. We affix at the bottom of the diagram the relative powers in figures,1061. THORAX. \ Hoadly, Lec. on Kesp., 4to, 1740, Lond., p. 11, j Dc Kesp. ii. e. viii.

Of the Respiratory Volumes. — For 1500 years, from the time of Galen to Robert Boyle, naturalists, physicians, and philoso- phers disputed the simple operation of draw- ing air into the thorax. There were three explanations given :—First, " That by the dila- tations of the chest the contiguous air is thrust away, and that, pressing upon the next air to it, and so onwards, the propulsion is continued till the air be driven into the lungs, and so dilate them." Secondly, That the chest is like a pair of common bellows, " which comes therefore to be filled because it was dilated." Thirdly, That the lungs are like a bladder " which is therefore dilated because it is filled." The great philosopher Boyle adopts the bel- lows' action viz., that the lungs are filled with air, because the chest is dilated, and that with- out the motions of the thorax they could not be filled. " Indeed," says Boyle, " the dia- phragm forms the principal instrument of ordinary and gentle respiration, although to restrained respiration, if I may so call it, the intercostal muscles, and perhaps some others, may be allowed eminently to concur." * Co- temporary with Boyle, we find Richard Lowerf (1667) correctly understanding the respiratory action; he makes a dog breathe like a broken-winded horse, by dividing the phrenic nerve. What Boyle and Lower demon- strated, every one now believes without dispute; yet it took 100 years' disputation, through a number of unfounded hypothetical and contra- dictory speculations, before the truths which Boyle anil Lower promulgated were received. As late as the eighteenth century, little more than one hundred years ago (a. d. 1737), it was stated in the Gulstonian Lectures before the Royal College of Physicians that there was air between the pleurae J, — a con- dition which we now know is almost instant * Boyle's Life and Works, fol., Lond. 1744, vol. i. p. 64. t Phil. Tr. Abr., vol. i. p. 179. et acq. death. The first great epoch in the history of respiration was at the time of Harvey (1628), when he published his first work on the circulation of the blood, though at this time he did not stand commended for his discovery ; for most persons opposed it ; others said it was old ; and the epithet " cir- culator," in its Latin invidious signification, was applied to him. We know respiration depends upon the weight of the air; and at a very remote period air was known to possess the quality of weight. Aristotle and other ancient philosophers expressly speak of the weight of the air. The process of re- spiration is attributed by an ancient writer to the pressure of the atmosphere forcing air into the lungs.* Galileo was therefore fully aware that the atmosphere possessed this pro- perty ; yet when his attention was so immedi- ately directed to one of the most striking effects of it, he did not see its connection with respira- tion. It was reserved for his pupil, Torricelli, to discover (1643) the true law of atmo- spheric pressure ; and as we can find no phi- losophical reason assigned, prior to this date, why air enters the lungs in inspiration, we may date this as a first step in the advance of knowledge upon our subject. Nevertheless, no less an authority than Swammcrdam adopted, for upwards of twenty years after this, the unphilosophical reasoning of Des- cartes, that the air was forced into the lungs by its increased density around the breast, oc- casioned by the dilatations of the thorax, in consequence of the elevation of the ribs. In 1667 some attention was paid to respira- tion being maintained by distinct volumes of air; for Hook kept a dog alive with common bellows by artificial respiration.f Fabticius, in the beginning of the 17th century, cor- rectly explained the action of the diaphragm. J Borelli is the earliest physiologist (1679) who * Lardner's Cyclop. Nat. Phil. Hydr. and Pneum. p. 247. t Phil. Tr. Abr. vol. i. p. 194.10G5 THORAX. established an experimental inquiry into the quantity of air received by a single inspiration.* Jurin improves upon Borelli. About this time (1708) Dr. James Keile made some correct measurements of the volume of air breathed, f Then followed Dr. Hales, who threw more light upon the doctrine of air, the power of respiration, and the power of the heart, than all his predecessors; yet he was quite ignorant of the use of respiration ; and at this period (1733) really very little was known upon the subject. In 1757 and fol- lowing years, Black, Rutherford, Lavoisier, Priestley, and Scheele, the chemists of the age, threw light upon the matter by discover- ing the composition of the atmosphere, and consequently the composition of respired air. It is since the time of Black that the most valuable mass of our knowledge upon respir- ation has been discovered. The functions of the thorax maybe divided into two great heads, — the chemical and the physical ; for an account of the former see Respiration. Every point of the thorax can move for the purpose of respiration; and hence has followed a division of these movements, nominated after the parts which respectively carry on their functions, viz. costal breathing, and ab- dominal or diaphragmic breathing. These motions are, in health, symmetrical, constant, regular, sensitive, and precisely the same; otherwise disease must exist. The breathing movements are also expres- sive of mental emotions. The tragedian imi- tates them to give force to the character he represents, whether it be the stealthy breathing of the Roman conspirator sharpen- ing his knife, or the deep swelling inspiration of Ajax defying the lightning ; these repre- sentations, without such movements, would be but dull pictures of the mind of the authors who left such characters on record. It is much easier to become delicately fa- miliar with these movements and their cha- racteristic differences, than it is to describe them. The latitude of movement, performed by the walls and floor of the thorax, admits of three common degrees of division :—■ First, extreme expansion or enlargement. Second, extreme contraction or diminution j and Third, an intermediate condition, — an or- dinal')' or quiescent state. These three divisions necessarily displace volumes of air of different magnitude. Were the respiratory movements but two in number, extreme expansion and extreme contraction, the quantity of air moved, and the character of the movement, would be easy of calculation and expression; but the interme- diate breathing or quiescent movement being so limited, so perfectly under the control of the will, so readily affected by mental emo- tions and by the animal functions, renders * De Motu Animalium, p. 2. prop 81. f Tentam. Mud. Phys. p. 80. the calculation of the volume of air ordinarily passing through the lungs a very difficult question. The quantity of air in the thorax, together with those portions which can be added at will, may be arranged and denominated thus : — First, residual air. Second, reserve air. Third, breathing air. Fourth, complemental air. Fifth, vital capacity. 1st. Of residual air. — After death the lungs contain air, which is not displaced by the last expiration ; this quantity remains in the thorax as long as the lungs maintain their natural structure; therefore we have no control over this volume of air : to it we assign the term " residual air." 2nd. Reserve air is that portion which re- mains in the chest after the gentle ordinary expiration, but which may be displaced at will. 3rd. Breathing air is that volume which is displaced by the constant gentle inspiration and expiration. 4th. The complemental air is that volume which can at will be drawn into the lungs by a violent exertion above the moderate effort of ordinary breathing, constituting the deepest possible inspiration. It is only occasionally demanded. 5th. The vital capacity is these last three divisions combined, being the greatest vo- luntary expiration, following the deepest inspi- ration.* This division of thoracic movements for commanding these different volumes of air may be more clearly illustrated by diagram 703. Fie. 703. ["Complemental air. Vital I capacity. <! Breathing air. LReserve air. Residual air. The division of l/ie thoracic movements. Let that portion marked H represent the resi- dual volume, or air left in the lungs, after a complete voluntary expiration ; the part next * According to physiological nomenclature, perhaps the term "vital capacity" may be objec- tionable; but we adopt it, for want of a better term, to signify a capacity or volume of air which can only he displaced hy living movements, and may therefore be termed a "Uving volume,'7 or "vital capacity."1066 THORAX. anteriorly, left white, — the reserve volume, or latitude of movement appropriated for dis- placing that air left in the lungs at the end of an ordinary expiration; the black stripe next anteriorly represents the mobi- lity for commanding the volume of breathing air; and lastly, beyond this another white stripe shows the extreme limit of inspiration or thoracic mobility commanding the com- plemental volume of air. These last three — viz. the complemental, breathing, and reserve volumes conjointly—we style vital capacity. The absolute capacity may be considered as all the divisions combined in one. Whatever limits the mobility of the thorax must modify the volume of air respired. This applies to any or all of the above movements. Therefore the measure of the volume of air displaced becomes a measure of the thoracic mobility ; and as disease affects the mobility of the chest, the measure of the volume of respired air becomes a measure of disease. The residual volume is entirely independ- ent of the will, and always present in the chest. The reserve volume, to use a simile, is a " tenant at will." The breathing volume is constantly passing out and in, many times a minute. The complemental volume is seldom in the chest, and then only for a very brief period. Whatever be the breathing volume ne- cessary for our well-being, the mobility demanded to maintain it is an intermediate mobility, just as the dark stripe in Jig. 703. is intermediate between the white stripes ; so that at both ends of the ordinary breathing mobility there exists a spare mobility, which we can command into action according to the necessities required. This reserve and com- plemental mobility may be looked upon as a broad, spare margin which encompasses our breathing ; so that any sudden exertion may not (as it otherwise would) produce painful dyspnoea and premature death. This spare mobility, therefore, is always ready to admit of irregularities in the ordinary breathing, such as frequent or infrequent, quick or slow, regular or irregular, great or small, equal or unequal, easy or difficult, complete or incomplete, long or short, abdominal or costal; as in coughing, running, laughing, crying, sing- ing, sighing, and vociferating, many of which are but extensions or modifications of the or- dinary mobility, infringing upon this margin — the complemental or reserved mobility. This spare mobility is not only ready for such exigencies as above mentioned, but it becomes a reservoir for "times of need." Thus a man can take from 230 to 300 cubic inches of fresh air into his lungs, and live upon it without inconvenience for two minutes with- out breathing. * The knowledge of this fact * It is better to inspire and expire forcibly five or six times, cleansing the lungs of the old air, and then give one deep inspiration, and there hold. For the first 15 seconds a giddiness will be ex- perienced ; but when this leaves us, we feel not the would be of much use towards rescuing a fellow creature from suffering amidst dense smoke or in an irrespirable atmosphere, as is found sometimes in mines and wells. A variation of this condition was once wit- nessed when Mr. Brunei descended to ex- amine the breach which the river had made in the Thames Tunnel. Having lowered the diving-bell nearly 30 feet to the mouth of the opening, this was found too narrow to admit the bell; so that no further observation could be made upon the workings, which were about 8 feet or 10 feet deeper: Mr. Brunei, therefore, laying hold of a rope, left the bell, and dived himself down the opening. His companions in the bell, being alarmed at the length of his stay, now about two minutes, gave the signal for pulling up ; and the diver, unprepared for the signal, had hardly time to catch the rope, which he had let go, and was surprised to find, on coming into the bell, that he had remained below so long. On descending again, he found that he could with ease remain fully two minutes under water. In this case the atmosphere, under a pressure of 30 feet of water, charged the lungs with nearly a double volume of air compressed into the same bulk as one volume at the surface of the water. Our ordinary breathing volume can only supply us for from three to five seconds ; for if we suddenly stop breathing for that time, we experience a degree of inconvenience. Of the volumes of air expelled from the lungs. — A knowledge of this is of incalcu- lable value to the physician and to the surgeon ; for disease cannot attack the lungs or the thoracic boundaries, without diminishing the respiratory volume, which change ultimately leads to the variations of the respiratory murmurs, first noticed as a diagnostic sign of disease by Laennec. Many experimenters have measured the different volumes of re- spired air, not primarily in reference to disease, but merely as collateral to the ob- servations of the chemist: hence experiments have been few, and deductions highly dis- crepant. (a) Residual volume.—Dr. Hales notices this volume, but assigns no measure for it*; Allen and Pepjs estimate it at 108 cubic inches in stout men of 5 feet 10 inchesf; Davy at 41 cubic inches J ; Goodwyn, by the mean of seven experiments, at 108 cubic inches; Kite, who writes expressly upon submersion, is obscure upon this point §; Dr. Bostock allows 120 cubic inches || ; Dunglison gives Menzie's estimate of 179 cubic inches ; Jurin estimates it at 220 cubic inches ; Fontana at 40; and Cuvier at from slightest inconvenience for want of air; and two minutes of time can be passed through without breathing. The most expert pearl-divers cannot re- main under water for a longer time. * Stat., vol. i., p. 239. ■j- Phil. Tr., 1809., vol. xcix. pp. 404. 428. { Chcm. and Phil.

I0G7 100 to 60; Mechli at 52 and 40*; Dr. Herbert, of Gottingen concludes this volume to be " very little." f We have found it to vary from 75 to 100 cubic inches. It must be relative to the absolute capacity of the chest, which varies from 248 to 457 cubic inches. The mean absolute capacity is 312 cubic inches. Allowing 100 cubic inches for the heart and large blood vessels, and 100 cubic inches for the parenchymatic structure of the lungs, will leave a little more than 100 cubic inches for the residual air; therefore Allen and Pepys's opinion may be relied upon as very near the truth. (b) Reserve volume. — Goodwyn omits this volume altogether; and this omission was pointed out forty years ago by a phy- siologist who himself omitted any notice of the complemental air. Kite estimates this at 87 cubic inches; Davy, by an experiment upon himself, at 77 cubic inches \ ; Dr. Bos- tock, from trials upon himself, at 160 or 170 (J; Mechel at 110 cubic inches.|| It averages about 100 cubic inches ; our obser- vations range from 70 to 110 cubic inches. It is regulated by the point at which the or- dinary breathing movement commences. (c) Breathing volume. — This has attracted most attention ; but the discrepancies of opinion are nearly commensurate with the number of observations. It would require years of labour to determine this volume by direct experiment, in a manner to be avail- able to the physician ; and it would re- quire a long time to perfect the observation of it upon a single patient, because these movements are so delicately affected by the mind, so perfectly uncontrollable, and the volume is so small, that a little error would seriously damage the value of the observation. The volume assigned by observers, varying from 3 to 100 cubic inches, is as follows :— Cub. in.

Though our ob- servations upon this point are but scanty com- pared with those we made on the vital capa- city, yet from about 80 experiments we con- clude that man in a perfectly quiet state, as when sitting, reading, &c, breathes much less than he does under the ordinary excitement of moving about. We think the perfectly quiet breathing, when we can scarcely perceive any movement (which is by no means uncommon), may be from 7 to 12 cubic inches, and when under ordinary excitement and exercise, from 1 6 to 20 cubic inches ; we have known it in one case as high as 77 cubic inches. It is probable that the quantity is relative to the volume of blood to be aerated. Herbert found that adults of smaller stature breathed less than those who were taller.* It is proba- ble that phthisical patients breathe very little, — from 2 to 4 cubic inches ; but the number of their breathing movements is greater, which compensates for this small quantity. (rf) Complemental volume. — Davy, from a single experiment (upon himself), calcu- lates this at 119 cubic inches f ; Kite, at nearly 200 cubic inches.j It is regulated by the position of the ordinary breathing movement, which is intermediate between it and the reserve air. It averages, from direct experiment, rather higher than the reserve volume, — about 105 or 110 cubic inches.

Dr. Thomson, from the mean of twelve experi- ments, upon men from fourteen to thirty- three years of age, states it at 186£ cubic inches. Dr. Thomson himself could expel 193 cubic inches.

We have determined the vital capa- city in one man as 80 cubic inches, in another 464 cubic inches ; therefore we might say this volume varies from 80 to 460 cubic inches ; but this discrepancy is cleared up, when we add that the height of the former was 3 feet 9 inches, and his weight 4 stone 9 lbs., while the latter measured 7 feet, with a weight of 22 stone ; and that if we arithmetically reduce the one to the other, the vital capa- city of a dwarf is within half an inch of what it actually was, viz. 79-56 cubic inches by cal- culation, and 80 cubic inches by direct expe- riment. Collateral observations clem- up the experiment; thus Kite was probably a tall man, and therefore he states the vital capacity as 300 cubic inches; Davy at 213 cubic inches, because he was of shorter stature, probably about 5 feet 7 inches; Hales, Jurin, and Goodwyn about 5 feet 8 inches. We come to this conclusion, because we find this vo- lume bear a strict relation to stature. There- fore, probably, all the observations already mentioned are correct, and only wanted an- other combination to remove the apparent discrepancies. We have especially directed our attention to one of these volumes of air, the vital capacity. Vital Capacity. — There are two ways of measuring the permeability of the lungs, or the volumes of air which they can displace, viz. by measuring the actual movement or mobility of the thoracic boundaries, or by directly measuring the absolute cubic inches of the volume of air expired. The former is open to an error, but the latter is not. * Thomson's Anim. Chem., 1843, p. 610. et seq. t Op. Cit. p. 32. note. % Op. Cit. p. 48. § Mayo's Outlines of Phys., p. 76. II Op.

If we take the movement as an index to the permeability of the lungs, we obtain an evidence only of movement, and not of the permeability of the lungs for air, for we may move the thoracic boundaries, and yet not breathe. But when we measure the volume of air, it is self-evident that this must be the measure of both the permeability of the lungs and of mobility of the thoracic bound- aries, because we cannot breathe without moving.

The number of cubic inches given by the deepest expiration, following the deepest inspiration. This was taken three times, and the highest observation was noticed. 2nd. The inspirator!/ power. 3rd. The expiratory power. 4th. Circumference of the chest over the nipples. 5th. Mobility of the chest with a tape- measure. 6th. The height. 7th. The weight. 8th. The pulse (sitting). 9th. The number of ordinary respirations per minute (sitting). 10th. The age 11th. Temperature of the air expired. To determine these points, we constructed an air receiver, denominated " Spirometer." We used a bent tube (haemadynamometer) for ascertaining the respiratory power, scales and stand for the height and weight, and a com- mon tape-measure for measuring the mobility of the chest. We rarely exceeded three consecutive ob- servations with the spirometer, because after this the volume of respired air diminishes from mere fatigue. , To measure the vital capacity volume. — The Spirometer (Jig. 704. ), consists of a vessel containing water, out of which a re- ceiver is raised by breathing into it through a10G9 THORAX. tube ; the height to which the receiver is raised, indicates the volume of the vital capacity. To Prepare the Spirometer for Use :— 1st. Place the spirometer about three feet from the ground, upon a firm, level table. 2nd. Turn off the water-tap 4, and open the air-tap 1. Fig. 704. Spirometer. 3rd. Pour into the spout, behind, clear cold water, until it is seen to rise behind the slip of glass 3 (above the air-tube). 4th. Slide the moveable index 2, opposite 0 on the graduated scale 13, and add more water until it is exactly on a level with the straight edge of this index ; if too much water be poured in, draw off, by the tap 4, sufficient to bring the water down to the edge of the index. 5th. Pour a little coloured spirit into the bent tube 5, until it stands about 3| inches, as at 6. 6th. Turn off the air-tap 1, then suspend the counterbalance weights, 11,11, from the cord over the pullies. The spirometer is now ready for an observa- tion. The flexible tube, terminated with a glass mouth-piece, is held by the person about to be examined, and the tap 1 is to be kept open by the operator while the deep expira- tion is being made. To discharge the air oat of the receiver. — It will be seen that if the tap 1 be opened, the receiver will rise out of the reservoir by the power of the counterbalance weights, until it touches the cross-head 9. To return the receiver into its original position, the con- tained air must be discharged; this can be done by slowly depressing the receiver down into the reservoir, and so pressing the air out by the way it entered, — through the air-tube. But, in order to do so more rapidly, a large valve at 14 admits of an instantaneous escape of the air. Therefore, to discharge the air, remove the plug 15 out of the socket 14 with one hand, while the other returns the receiver into its original position. Let the person to be examined loose his vest, and any other tight garment — for the least pressure from dress affects the mobility — stand perfectly erect {fg. 705.), with the head Fig. 705. thrown well back ; then slowly and effectually fill his chest with air, or inspire as deeply as possible, and then he must lift the mouth- piece of the spirometer 12 to his lips, still standing in the same erect position, and place the glass mouth-piece between the lips, holding it there sufficiently tight so as not to allow any breath to escape, he then slowly makes the deepest expiration, displacing all the air he can out of his lungs through the mouth-piece into the spirometer, where it is measured to cubic inches, and confined there by a stop-cock, until examined. This ob- servation should be taken three times. The operator, while the experiment is going on should place his left hand upon the shoulder of the person being examined ; in this way he can determine as to the perfect inflation of the lungs and expulsion of air from them as w ell as the character of the thoracic expansion. The thumb of the opera'or should cross the clavicle, while the fingers rest on the upperTHORAX. 1070 edge of the scapula, then he feels the expand- ing effect of inspiration, the swelling up of the apex of the thorax. To determine the volume of air in the spi- rometer. — The graduated scale 13 is attached to the receiver, and made to extend down- wards on the outside of the reservoir, so as always to he in relation with the index 2. On this scale 0 corresponds with the top of the receiver, or rather with the highest point to which the water can be made to rise within it. The number of cubic inches is shown by the degree upon the scale pointed to by the index 2, which corresponds with the level of the water in the receiver. But the water in the reservoir seen behind the slip of glass may not be level with the water within the receiver, just as the level of the water in a pneumatic trough may be higher or lower than the level of the water contained in a glass receiver standing upon the shelf. To know when these are level, depress the receiver until the coloured fluid in one leg of the bent tube, or inverted syphon, 5, stands level with that in the other leg. as at 6; then the water contained in the receiver, and that external to it, are level to each other ; and the air within the receiver is of the same density as that without. Immediately the plug 15 is replaced, and the hands withdrawn from the receiver, the latter will be seen to ascend some half-inch, the water behind the slip of glass to fall, and the coloured fluid in the bent tube to be unequal. This is caused by the excess of weight in the counterbalance (11, 11,), which is what necessitates the observation of the coloured fluid in the bent tubes and the cor- rection above directed. The scale is gra- duated to degrees, each of which measures two cubic inches. To correct the respired volume for tcm- peralure. — The table of the vital capacity- volume is calculated at 60° Fahr. The tempe- rature of a volume of air displaced out of the lungs into the spirometer is reduced at once to the temperature of the water in the spiro- meter. This, according to the season of the year, may be 50° or 80°. Now 330 cubic inches at 50° would occupy 337 cubic inches at 60°, and 330 at 80°, would be 317 at 60°. For eight months out of the year there needs no correction. But a correction is necessary, when a thermometer in the room stands much above or below 00°. We may estimate the change in the bulk of air as for every degree (Fahr.) of variation of temperature ; thus if a man breathe, in winter, 295 cubic inches of air into the spirometer, when the thermometer in the room stands at 55°, being 5 degrees below 60°, then = 2-95, must be added to the 295 cubic inches, making 297-95, or, in round numbers, 298 cubic inches. On the other hand, if the vital ca- pacity be determined at 215 cubic inches, when the thermometer stands at 72°, which is 12° above 60°, = 5 must be deducted ; making the corrected observation 210, instead of 215 cubic inches. In the absence of the spirometer, the mea- sure of the ■mobility of the ribs, by means of a common tape measure is of much value * To measure the mobility of the thorax with a tape measure, pass the tape measure round the chest under the waistcoat, over the region of the nipples, request the person to in- spire deeply, and note that circumference, then to expire deeply, and again note the circumference, the difference is what we term the mobility. This is a rough measure- ment, but of no little value in doubtful cases of chest disease. This difference, or mobility, in men of all statures should be about 3 inches, if it is found only 2i inches the examination should be carried further ; sometimes the mobility extends to 5\ inches, but this is excessively rare. As a general rule, when we find the mobility three inches, we find the vital capacity volume correspond w ith our table. Sometimes the mobility may be good, and the vital capacity bad, because, as we have already noticed, we may move the walls of the chest without breathing. The vital capacity is a constant quantity ; habit will not increase it. But this volume is disturbed directly, and modified by five circum- stances : 1st, by height ; 2nd, by position ; 3rd, by weight; 4th, by age ; 5th, by disease. 1st. Of the effect of height. The vital capacity volume bears a striking relation to the height of the individual exa- mined; so that, if we take a man's height, we can tell the volume of his vital capacity. We show this by a curve in fig. 710., as before ; let the perpendicular lines represent the heights increasing inch by inch from the left towards the right ; the single continuous line is the curve of the vital capacity, which gradually ascends as it passes over the perpendicular lines. The heights extend from 5 feet to 6 feet; above six feet the observations are few. Whe- ther the vital capacity volume maintains the same regular progression beyond this point remains to be determined. If we draw a line in a perfect arithmetical ascent of eight units for every increasing height, the line of vital capacity will be observed to run nearly pa- rallel with it; therefore this volume increases with the increase of stature. The figures at the bottom represent the vital capacity in cubic inches, being the mean of the observa- tions under each height. The following table (Table T.) places the subject more in detail: — A cursory inspection of the table shows that the vital capacity increases with the height ; this is without any consideration as to age, weight, or circumference of the chest. For clearness, we arrange it in a more re- duced form, as in Table U. * Dr. Sibson and Dr. Quain have invented some ingenious instruments for measuring the thoracic movements externally.1071 THORAX.

We found that the men from 5 feet to 5 feet 2 in. gave a mean vital capacity of 176 cub. in.; the men two inches taller a mean of 191 cub. inches ; the next, 207 cub. in., and so on ; thus the volume increases as we descend the column. Finding the progression so regular, we arranged a fourth column, containing a series of numbers in perfect arithmetical progression, commencing with 174, and increasing sixteen at every subse- quent step, corresponding to the two inches of height successively added. We found, upon comparing the two columns of observations with the column of calculation, that there was a close resemblance. The increase of sixteen for every two inches is of course the same as eight for every single inch; hence the rule deduced upon nearly 2000 cases (and subsequently confirmed by double that number) viz. That for every inch of stature, from 5 feet to Gfeet, eight additional cubic inches of air, at 60°, are given out by a forced expiration. This brings the detailed matter of a series of tables and calculations into a point, and easy of remembrance, the more so as extended ob- servations upon nearly 5000 men have brought the column of observation so close to the column of regular progression, that it is only necessary now to take the column of regular progression as a standard for examining the condition of the lungs as to their perme- ability for air, and the mobility of the tho- racic boundaries. If we recollect that at the height of 5 feet, Table V. —Vital Capacity Volume (temp. 60° F.) necessary to Health at the Middle Period of Life. Height.

These numbers may be taken as expressions of certain conditions of the thorax, an expression of mobility relative to breathing, and conse- quently an expression of the permeability of the lung. It therefore follows that whatever affects the mobility of the thoracic bound- aries, or the permeability of the lungs, the amount of that cause is expressed by the volume of the vital capacity. Incipient disease is quick in affecting the vital capacity; the amount of the injury therefore is readily measured. We are at a loss to assign any just reason why the vital capacity is rela- tive to the height, which is regulated by the length of the limbs, and not by the length of the trunk of the body. We have found by experiment, that whatever be the standing height, the sitting height is nearly the same in all persons of between 5ft. and 6ft., and if not actually the same, yet it is not a rule that the tallest men sit the highest ; for in- stance, one man standing 6ft. O^in. measured from his seat 2ft. 1 If in., whlie another who stood 5ft. 6in., sat 3ft. high ; therefore the length of the trunk bears no constant propor- tion to the length of the legs. And we found that men who stood low, breathed less than men who stood higher, but who sat the same height. Thus fig. 706. represents two men ; A. stood 4ft. 4|in., B. 5ft. 9iin.; they were of the same age and circumference of the chest. The weight of the short man was 7st. 2ilb., that of the taller man lOst. 31b. Yet their sitting height was precisely the same, as is shown in fig. 707. Nevertheless, the vital capacity volume of the shorter man was 152, and that of the taller man 236 cubic inches; so that the man who stood the shorter, but who sat as tall, if not taller, breathed eighty- four cubic inches less than the man who stood seventeen inches higher. The mobility of the chest of the taller man was nearly four inches, that of the shorter man three inches. We ex- amined several such cases with similar results. The average vital capacity volume at all heights is about 230 cubic inches. The greatestTHORAX. 1073 we have examined was Randall's ; height 7 ft. weight 22st.; vital capacity 464 cubic inches. The smallest was Don Francisco; height 29in., weight about 40 lbs. ; vital capacity 46 cubic Fig. 706. Relative height of two persons standing. inches. The highest vital capacity at the height of 5 ft. 8 in. was 330 cubic inches. A question arises, are the lungs and tho- racic parietes at their maximum stretch when they contain the appropriate vital capacity volume ? We believe not. The vital capa- city of the person from whom the preparations figured above {Jigs. 680. ct scq.) were taken, whose height was 5>ft. 4 in., weight 1071b., was 198 cubic inches ; yet, after death, we forced 300 cubic inches of air into his lungs without rupturing them, being 102 cubic inches more than he could expire during life. There- fore there is still a spare mobility of parts, probably in reserve, to be exercised when dis- ease attacks the lungs. 2nd. Vital capacity affected by the posi- tion of the body. — We have said a man must hold himself erect to breathe out a good vo- lume of air ; because the mobility of the ribs is affected by the uprightness of the spine; and, more than this, whatever touches the ribs affects their mobility, and consequently the vital capacity. Thus, standing, we have produced a vital capacity of 260 cubic inches ; sitting erect 255 cubic inches; recumbent — supine 230, prone 220 cubic inches ; position making a difference of 40 cubic inches. This may explain why patients with emphysematous lungs sit up in bed, and why for them to lie recumbent, is "suffocating;" because they thereby diminish the thoracic mobility. It may be well to recollect this effect upon respi- ration, in treatment of diseases of the spine, particularly at the present time, when they are Fig, 707. treated by laying the patient on the anterior pacity from 260 to 220 cubic inches. part of the chest for weeks and months to- 3rd.

IV. 3 zTHORAX. 1074 as yet the relation does not appear so regular as that of the height. We are scarcely in a position, at present, safely to say much upon this point. As a general rule we find the weight increases with the height; so that it is not easy to separate the effect of one from that of the other. Suppose we take two men of the same stature, say 5 feet 8 inches, the one 10 stone, the other 14 stone in weight; one of them above par, the other may be either at, or below par. If 10 stone be considered par, the 14 stone man is 4 stone in excess, or corpulent to 40 per cent. This excess weight blocks up the range of mobility, and thus, mechanically, diminishes the vital capacity volume. But let us suppose men of dissimilar heigths, one 5 feet 8 inches and the other 6 feet; the 6 foot man should be heavier than the shorter man ; — say 3 stone heavier. This is not excess weight with him, and does not interfere with his thoracic mobility; therefore there is an inseparable relation between the height and weight. If, in a series of experiments, we sink the height entirely, and keep the mere weight in view, we shall find that the result as to the vital capacity volume is without order.

We have also found the mean vital capa- city of 147 men of 11 stone as 225 cubic inches, and that of 32 men of 14 stone, only 233 cubic inches, an increase of 8 cubic inches for an increase of 42 lbs., or 3 stone. The over- whelming effect of height disturbs the above observation; therefore the height must be kept in view. We have calculated the weights in relation to height, with reference to the res- piratory function, upon a number of men at the middle period of life. Besides the three classes mentioned above, we have included 1554 cases of healthy men in the prime of life, oblig- ingly furnished by Mr. Brent, viz. the Oxford and Cambridge rowers, London watermen, cricketers, pedestrians, and gentlemen ( Table X). The weight now appears more regular, increasing with the height, as from 92 lbs. to 218 lbs.

Their rise is 6'2 from 5 1 to 5 4 3-3 — 5 4 „ 5 7 6-5 — 5 7 „ 5 11 There is an inequality from 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 7 inches in the weight; but this would in all probability disappear if the ob- servations were more extended ; at present it may be stated generally that the weight in- creases 6-5 lbs. (or 61 lbs.) for every inch of stature from 5 feet 7 inches to 6 feet, and 6-2 lbs. for every inch of stature from 5 feet 1 inch to 5 feet 4 inches, and 3-3 lbs. for every inch from 5 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 7 inches. At 5 feet 8 inches, or 68 inches of stature, the weight is 155*2 lbs., or nearly 11 stone ;THORAX. 1075 *3 z 2 from this as a starting point the weight at any height may (so far as our limited ob- servations warrant) be readily calculated. For instance, the weight is, at the height of 5 feet 155-2 8 inches, ~~gg~ = 2'282 lbs. for every inch of stature, or 27'38 lbs. for every foot of stature. The bulk or weight of bodies having the same relative proportions, is as the third power (cubes) of either of their diameters: thus, if a person 67 inches high weighs 148-44 lbs., a person 69 inches high Taking the height from 67 to 71 inches, we have as follows : — Table Z.—The calculated Weight compared with the observed Weight, according to the above Form.

The weights vary as the 2-7oth power of the height, and not as the 3rd power. The rela- tion between the two is quite close enough to show, that there is a very intimate connec- tion between the height and the weight. The observation is made upon 1276 men at the middle period of life. We have found that the vital capacity in- creases 42 cubic inches with the weight from 100 lbs. to 155 lbs., and from 155 lbs. to 200 lbs. the effect is balanced by minus 5 and plus 5 cubic inches. In the first division there is an increase of 42 cubic inches ; the weight then comes into power, and disturbs the regular progression for the next division ; therefore we may say there is in the second division a de- crease of 42 cubic inches in the vital capacity volume from the effect of weight.

Hie Effect of Weight on the Vital Capacity. sent this by a curve.^g. 708. The continuous curve is the line of vital capacity crossing the perpendicular lines of progressive weights. The curve of volume ascends, and attains its highest at 160 lbs., and from thence it is nearly horizontal to 200 lbs. According to this, the vital capacity increases nearly in the ratio of 1 cubic inch per lb. from 105 to 155lbs., and from 155 to 200 lbs. there is no increase. This illustration of the effect of weight is cal- culated at one height, viz. 5 feet 6 inches ; therefore to this height only these points of weight (from l]i to 14 stone) refer. We have noticed that the weight increases in a certain ratio with the height, and that the weight at 5 feet 6 inches affects the vital capacity in the relation just mentioned, com- mencing when the weight exceeds 7 per cent upon the average weight. We may, perhaps, connect this same relation with the other heights through the arithmetical progression of inch by inch. For example : — the weight of men of 5 feet 1 inch is 199-9 lbs. ; to this add 7 per cent (8 395 lbs.), making 128"2 lbs.; again, the tallest men, 5 feet 11 inches, weigh 174*2 lbs. ; to this add 7 per cent (12*2 lbs.), making 186-4 lbs.: therefore, at the height of 5 feet 1 inch a man must exceed 128 lbs., or 9 stone 2 lbs., and the 5 feet 11 inches' man 186 lbs., or 13 stone 4 lbs., before weight may be expected to diminish the vital capa- city volume in the relation of 1 cubic inch per lb. for the next 25 lbs., 2A- stone being the limit of our calculation. When the man exceeds the mean weight (at each height) by 7 per cent, the vital capacity decreases 1 cubic inch per lb. for the next 35 lbs. above this weight. Beyond this it is not improbable but that the decrease of the vital capacity is in some geometrical progression. Below the mean weight w e have never found by experiment, that the vital capacity is affected by weight. The cause of the difference of weight between men is involved in much obscu- rity.* We may in fact consider the usual weight of a man as his mean weight and * See Chambers, Gulstonian Lect. 1850.THORAX. 107G •S9SB3 co CM tp UO 1Q o UO CO o CO Ol CO Ol oo Ol CO CO CO TP ,oi co Ol CO lbs. 190 200 u tp CO CM 00 O CM Ol Tf r- 00 CM CO CO Ol UO CM CM •sassQ cm | : CM CM UO | CI I> CC | O CO ^oo- CO CM CO uso co •S?S3l]3 O | CO 1 ; tp 1 co 1 : 00 00 TP fH 1 00 CO 1 CO X CO CO 00 00 r~ Ol 00 CO lbs. 180 190 CO 00 o> CO CM CI CM CM TP CM CM CO 01 CO TP CM CO Ol TP t~ Ol CO CM CM •S3SB3 r~ co uo o> CO uo CO TP 00 I - CM ■SJS31IQ : i co 00 CO : 1 co 00 CO 00 CO 1- I 00 CO 1 CO CO CO 00 TP Ol 251 37 i r- CO I CO lbs. 170 180 a . o uo CM 00 CO OS TP CM 00 CM CM TP CM 00 Ol Ol 01 •S9SB3 CO o CO CM 00 >o TP CM 00 co CO CM CO •s}S3q3 r- 1 £- CO 1 CO 00 CO CO 1 CO 1 CO CO 1 CO 1 CO CO CO CO 1 <C CO 1 CO CO CO o> CO CO CO . o o » IS t- a .

Thus, if a man may lose weight below his usual weight, he should gain above his usual weight before he can be said to have gained weight. The effect of weight in diminishing the re- spiratory volume, need not in the least disturb the observer, when testing the lungs through the measurement of the vital capacity, with re- ference to phthisis or any other chest disease. For collateral observations and the history of the case, will sufficiently protect him'from such difficulty. We see that the weight increases at so much per inch ; we have no doubt that by extended observations it will be found to be regular through the whole series of heights, and that it will be found to increase 7 lbs. for every inch of stature. We know that the respiratory power increases in a similar arithmetical relation. We do not mean thatTHORAX. 1077 the lb. will correspond to the inch, for that is accidental, merely depending upon the units employed, but that the increase of each will be found in an arithmetical progression, and hence, probably, the reason why tall men breathe more than short men. But the weight can never be the sure guide that the height is, because the former varies at any time in life, even in a few days ; where- as the latter varies only at the extremes of life. 4th. Relation of vital capacity to Hie circum- ference of the thorax.— We notice this here, because the question is so natural, " Has the size of the chest no relation to the vital capacity?" We do not find that there exists any direct relation between the cir- cumference of the chest and the vital capa- city. We have found — Height. Circum. Vital Men. ft. in. in. capacity. 11 5 8 35 235 10 5 8 38 226 Therefore, the men with chests 3 inches larger, breathed 9 cubic inches less, or 21 men of the same height, but of different-sized chests, breathed a mean vital capacity of 230 (the due quantity according to Table T). We have consolidated the following result upon 994 cases, the height is kept in view, calcu- lated at 5 feet 6i inches.

There is a certain rude relation between the thoracic dimensions and the vital capacity ; if, for in- stance, one man has a chest 35 inches in cir- cumference, and 3 inches mobility, and another man lias a chest 40 inches in circumference, and 4 inches mobility, then the latter will surely displace a larger volume of air than the former, but omitting this, we expect as large a vital capacity from a man with a thin and narrow thorax, as from a man with a broad and deep thorax. In fact, aeration need have no re- lation to the thoracic dimension ; and, for the same reason, the size of the chest no relation to the vigour of the whole man. Indeed we incline to the contrary, viz. that it is most likely the respiration is most vigorous in the narrow-chested man, when the mobility is greatest. The vigour of the lungs, like every other organ in the body, we believe, has no relation to the dimensions. One person may have a brain 1 lb. lighter, or £ less than an- other person, and yet their capacity and men- tal qualities shall not appear different. 5th. Vital capacity affected by age, — Age affects the breathing movements, but less re- markably than the height and weight. Indeed the influence of age was not apparent in the first calculation upon 1012 cases, nor until we took a basis of 1923 cases. Time affects life in two ways, first bringing it to perfection, and then determining that perfection. Table C C. — Effect of Age, from Observations on 1775 healthy Men. the Height being kept in View.

From 15 to 35 years of age the vital ca- pacity is increased, and from 35 to 65 years of age it is decreased in the progression of 19, 11, and 13 cubic inches. We illustrate this by a curve in fig. 709. The curve of the vital capacity will be seen to rise slightly as it passes the perpendicular lines of years until it comes to 35 years of age, after which it keeps declining as it cuts all the succeeding lines of quinquennial periods down to 65 years. We may say, therefore, that the vital capacity increases with the age up to 3 z 3,1078 THORAX. Fig. 709. Years ("15 1-20 20 25 25 30 30 35 35 40 40 45 45 50 50 55 55 60 60 65 Vital capacity.

We have not brought in the effect of time before the age of 55 years. This is supposed to be at the mean weight. The first column is derived from observation, the two second are derived from calculation. 6th. Of the effect of disease upon the vital capacity. — The effect of disease upon re- spiration was well known to Boerhaave and Morgagni, they considered that the disturb- ance of any organ in the body would dis- order the whole function of respiration. Morgagni devotes more than one-sixth of his celebrated work, the " Seats and Causes of Disease" " to diseases which affect respiration" We may safely say all thoracic and abdominal diseases, as tumours, abscesses, and acute in- flammations, will affect the respiration. Of the different respiratory volumes, we select that one which requires the most extended mo- bility, viz. the vital capacity, which becomes altered to an extent commensurate with that of any disease physically affecting our respiration, it is therefore a test of the pre- sence and extent of such diseases. Such movements as command this volume, extend from the neck to the plantar muscles of the feet. One condition which we have been accus- tomed to look upon as affecting our breathing, does not affect it, viz. old pleuritic adhesions. Fig. 710. ft. in. Heights. £g 0 Healthy. Diseased.

The lungs had to be torn out by little pieces, and so strong was the adhesion to the diaphragm, that in removing them this muscle was ruptured, yet the living respiratory mobility of the thoracic walls exceeded by three inches the whole thoracic space allotted for the heart and lungs, as measured after death. This space to the mobility was as 248 to 251. In other respects the lungs were healthy. Of all diseases, phthisis pulmonalis most readily affects the vital capacity, not only when the lungs are beginning to be infiltrated with tubercular matter, but probably before this. This is shown in fig. 710. Taking all the cases together, the difference is about 50 per cent. The effect of this disease upon the vital capacity in the case of Freeman was very remarkable. This man came from America in 1842 "trained for a prize fight." He was examined when in his " best condition," and his vital capacity measured 434 cub. in. (temp. 60°); height, 6 ft. 1 If in.; weight, 19 st. 5 lbs.; circumference of the chest, 47 in.; inspiratory power, 5"0 in. ; expiratory power, 6-5 in. Freeman fought his battle, and for the sub- sequent two years lived a rambling and dissolute life. In November, 1844, exactly two years afterwards, he came to town in ill health. At this time there was no ausculta- tory evidence of phthisis pulmonalis ; but the following difference appeared in his vital capacity-volume: Nov. 1842 - Nov. 1844 - Dec. 1844 - Vital Capacity.

Another remark- able case was that of a man of perfectly healthy appearance, and in whom there was no auscultatory or general sign of organic disease, but whose vital capacity was deficient by 47 cub. in.; and it was found, within three days of the time when he was examined, that the left lung at the apex was studded with miliary tubercles, the whole not extending bevond a square inch. In diseases of the spine, particularly in angular curvature, the mobility is changed sometimes to such a degree that the vital capacity is diminished to 20 cub. in. A full meal will even make a difference in the thora- cic mobility, of from 12 to 20 cubic inches. If the vital capacity is deficient, there must be some cause producing the effect. It may or may not be in the thoracic cavity. Collateral observations must point more definitely to the diseased part. The spirometer is only a gauge to measure the mobility and perme- ability of the lung; other circumstances must point out the cause of the mobility and per- meability being affected. Taking the observa- tions upon the diseased cases by calculation, the vital capacity volume may be arranged for all heights as follows : * Table E E,—Effect of Phthisis Pulmonalis upon the Vital Capacity.

It has been found that ten cubic inches below the due quantity, i. e. 220 instead of 230 inches, need not excite alarm ; but there is a point of deficiency in the breathing volume at which it is difficult to say whether it is merely one of those physiological differences dependent on a certain irregularity in all such observations, or deficiency indicative of disease. A deficiency of 16 per cent, is sus- picious. A man below 55 years of age breath- ing 193 cub. in. instead of 230 cub. in., unless he is excessively fat, is probably the subject of disease. In phthisis pulmonalis the deficiency may amount to 90 per cent., and yet life be main- tained. The vital capacity volume is likewise a measure of improvement. A phthisical patient may improve so as to gain 40 upon 220 cub. in. Of the Respiratory Movements.—The breathing volumes have been divided into three kinds; so likewise the breathing move- ments admit of a similar division, — one ordi- nary and two extraordinary movements. By the independent action of the intercostal muscles, every intercostal lamella can act sepa- rately, therefore we have the thorax furnished with 22 spaces by which it can enlarge; and * See "Spirometer Observations," First Report of the Hospital for Consumption, p. 23. et sea. Loud 1849.THORAX. 1080 the diaphragm acting as one muscle, makes 23 mobile regions for respiration. The respiratory movements of health may be classed as costal and abdominal. The cha™ racter should be established by the order in which they follow each other. In health the walls of the thorax and the floor do not dilate simultaneously but consecutively. The character of" the breathing'" cannot always be told by the eye, but it can always be deter- mined by the touch. If we stand behind a patient, when seated and leaning against the back of the chair or against our person, and pass the right arm over the shoulder, extending it over the anterior part of the chest, until the hand rests upon the abdomen over the umbilical region, we command a delicate index of the breathing movements. It will then be found, that in ordinary male breathing the ab- domen first bulges outwards ; the ribs and sternum nearest the abdomen gently follow this movement, until the motion, like a wave, is lost over the thoracic region. The undu- lation commences at the abdomen. This is aoaomina, or diaphragmatic respiration. We here have costal motion, but as the ribs moved second it is not called costal breathing. In costal breathing the upper ribs move first, and the abdomen second. This is the ordinary breathing in women. All difficult, sudden, and extraordinary breathing is costal; we at such times direct all our power towards the apex of the thorax, first expanding that region, and gradually those below it. When we determine the order of breathing by the sight, we must be careful to take the position of the body into account. If the pa- tient be recumbent (supine), we may notice extensive costal motion, and, indeed, it may be true costal breathing ; but place the pa- tient erect, and the breathing may be diaphrag- matic. When recumbent, all the motion is thrown forwards, the natural backward and lateral motion of the ribs being prevented ; and so sensitive are the breathing movements to impediments, that they may either take a reverse action, or all the motion being thrown forwards, will give a preternatural movement of the ribs, which may be mistaken for costal respiration. Profile view of the breathing movements — («) Ordinary breathing (Male). — Fig. 711 was obtained by tracing the shadow of a man on paper. The back was fixed, so as to throw all the movement forwards. The anterior black, continuous line represents the ordinary breathing. This line is thicker over the ab- domen than elsewhere. The anterior margin of this line indicates the boundary of the ordi- nary inspiration, and the posterior margin the boundary of the ordinary expiration. (Female).— This is represented by the anterior continuous line in fig.l\2., in the same manner as shown in the male. This line in the female is broadest over the sternum, and narrow over the abdomen. The movement over the abdomen of the female is so small, that the number of the respirations cannot Fig. 711. Respiratory Movements. Male. Deep inspiration, dotted line; ordinary state, continuous line; deep expiration, anterior margin of the shade. be counted by the hand resting on that region as it can be on the male. The question of why women breathe costal, and men abdo- minal, we cannot pretend to answer. We doubt its being caused by any tight costume, for we found the same to exist in twenty-four girls between the ages of eleven and four- teen, none of whom had ever worn any tight dress. This peculiarity may be a reservation Fig. 712. w I HP" MmmMSSBuSBBr Respiratory Movements. Female. Inspiration, dotted line. Ordinary, continuous line.

(b) Deep inspiratory. — In Jig. 711. the dotted line shows this position, as when a man is just ready to displace his vital ca- pacity-volume. The sternum is protruded and the abdomen is drawn in. This is the same in the female (Jig. 712.), the dotted line is most advanced over the sternum, while over the abdomen it is drawn inwards. So much is the abdomen drawn in- wards by deep inspiration, that the portion of the continuous line (Jigs. 711, and 712.), representingtheordinary breathing is (over the abdominal region) external to the dotted line of deep inspiration. Therefore the greatest enlargement of the thoracic cavity in both sexes is made by the ribs, and not by the diaphragm, as is generally believed. It appears very questionable whether the dia- phragm is any thing more than flattened and that without descending. Of the position of the diaphragm. — It is clear that all that space between the line of ordinary breathing and deep inspiration (fg. 711.), below the ensifonn cartilage, where the two lines cut each other, may be considered as just so much space deducted from the abdominal cavity; and therefore the abdominal cavity, by deep breathing, is just so much less than it was in the posi- tion of ordinary breathing. Now, if the dia- phragm descends at this moment, whilst the abdominal parietes are being constringed on all sides, what becomes of the abdominal vis- cera ? We know that in ordinary breathing the abdomen advances because the diaphragm descends, and recedes because the diaphragm ascends. We may suppose the same accom- modating movement between the diaphragm and abdominal parietes, to take place in deep breathing. There can be no doubt that the cir- cumference of the thorax is increased, as shown inD.^g. 670., and that the diaphragm must extend its borders, and consequently the arch must be flattened ; but this may be without descending. We see (fig. 670.) that the sec- tion of the thorax to the area of the diaphragm is as 40 to 133—the concavity of the dia- phragm is enough to admit of its circumfe- rence expanding without its descending. Fig. 715. is a diagram of sections of the base of the living chest in thre e stages, b is the chest in ordinary : a, as in extreme expiration ; c, as in extreme inspiration. In this case the vital ca- pacity was 305 cubic inches, and the mobility of the chest was 5 inches, a range by no means common. The area of the chest varied 27 superficial inches between extreme inspiration and expiration.* In the sitting posture the same relations Fig. 715.

(e) Of the deep expiratory position. — In figs. 711. and 712. the margin of the shade is the position of the thoracic boundaries in deep expiration. We have supposed the figures above men- tioned as standing with the back fixed, for the purpose of making clearly manifest the relative position of these several breathing movements. In fig. 716. the body is quite free, and wholly alters its position in performing expiration and inspiration. This should al- ways be considered in noticing the breathing movements in diagnosis. Fig. 71G. Respiratory Movements. Mate, standing. Expiration, dotted line. Inspiration, continuous line. (d) Of the change of position by extreme breathing. — In expiration the head is pro- truded and lowered (see figs. 713. and 714.). Therefore, by inspiration the body is raised, and the more erect the more can be inspired ; by expiration it is lowered, so much so that we have seen men when displacing their vital capacity volume stoop themselves to one-half their natural height, to one-sixth frequently: we speak from a large number of cases,— nearly 4000. Physiologists have reasoned that, as upon the principle of a bladder becom- ing longer when empty than when inflated, so the chest is shorter when inflated than when empty. But this example in no way corresponds. The bladder expands, because it is inflated; the chest is inflated because it expands. We have given the position of the breath- ing parts (the body fixed) : we shall describe the movement of these parts relatively in time and order to each other, and the peculiar character of these movements in health, and some of their modifications by disease. Ordinary breathing.—In men this is sym- metrical, and very limited, and commences with an advancing and receding of the abdo- men at and above the umbilical region, accom- panied with a slight lateral enlargement, and immediately followed by a bulging outwards at the cartilages of the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs, and that part of the abdomen contiguous to them, with a slight advance of the lower third of the sternum. This is abdominal breathing, because the abdomen moves first; and is confined to motion of the base of the thorax. In women it is likewise symmetrical, commencing with a gentle heaving of the upper part of the thorax, more or less apparent ac- cording to the fulness of the mammae. This expansion commences with the 1st and next three ribs following each other in succession, accompanied with a slight elevation of the shoulders and a slight lateral enlargement of the chest, which is immediately followed by a bulging outwards of the abdomen. So quick is this motion of the diaphragm after the mo- tion of the ribs, that at times they appear to be S3'nchronous, especially when the individual examined is conscious of the observation, though it is only an accommodating movement of the diaphragm. This is costal breathing, because the ribs move first, and the motion is chiefly confined to the apex of the thorax. Therefore that which is a healthy respiratory movement in women is pathological in men. Of the extraordinary breathing in both sexes (Inspiration). — This, like ordinary breathing, is symmetrical: the clavicles, shoulders, sca- pula, and superior ribs are raised, the sternum advances, the infra-clavicular region swells re- markably upwards and outwards (particularly in females) like a rolling wave, the supra-cla- vicular region is raised but this sometimes ap- pears comparatively deepened (merely by the action of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus), the whole apex of the thorax is rendered more ob- tuse, particularly in the antero-posterior dia- meter. The lower ribs, at their cartilaginous extremities, spread outwards, increasing both the lateral and the antero-posterior diameter of the base of the thorax, the cartilaginous (go- thic) arch formed by the junction of the Gth, 7th. 8th, 0th, and 10th ribs below the sternum, becomes more obtuse by their lateral motion, the abdominal space within this arch, down to the umbilicus, sinks inwards. Therefore this breathing is costal, commencing with the superior ribs, and terminating over the ab- domen. The peculiar character of healthy breathing (and it is impossible to lay too much stress upon the movements of deep inspira- tion, because they are so indicative of thoracic disease) is that the ribs expand in succession. There is an indescribable undulating roll, pro- duced by the consecutive action of the re- spective ribs, which always commences with a superior rib ; — in costal breathing, a lowerTHORAX. 1083 rib never moves first. In fact when we inspire deeply we feel as if we directed all our power to the four or five superior ribs, giving the greatest expansion to the very apex of the lungs,— that most vulnerable part in phthisis pulmonalis. When we look at the thoracic cavity we see why this great power and mo- bility is given to the upper part of the chest. We see that the six superior ribs encompass more space than the six inferior ribs. (See fig. 668.) So that where we command most movement, there is the greatest portion of lung to be expanded. The hand can measure most delicately this healthy characteristic swelling or filling up of the apex better than any instrument, because the hand covers alarge field ofthe chest, and can distinguish the undulating movement. Standing behind the person to be examined, the fingers of both hands should be placed over the clavicles, so that the tips rest on the infra-clavicular regions, and the thumbs over the inner borders ofthe scapulae. When a deep inspiration is taken the fingers and thumb of each hand diverge from each other, and we thus gain a perfect knowledge of the healthy "swelling expansion." If the deep respiratory movement is good, the ordinary movement is sure to be good likewise. The mere flat hand on the anterior and upper part of the chest (facing the patient) will likewise give the character, though less delicately. This movement or swelling of the apex by deep inspiration, is more distinctly marked on the female than on the male subject. If this fine swelling motion in deep breathing is absent disease is present. Pathological respiratory movements. — We now speak of another class of breathing move- ments, which are peculiar in this respect, that the " undulating swell" of the chest is wanting. The twelve intercostal mus- cles move in every combination, as if to meet impending difficulties, — tenacious of life, and yielding only by compulsion to the ad- vance of disease. Throughout the long list of diseases which attack man these instinctive movements have to contend, — shifting about, or "rowing less and less. We have noticed a man with lung disease, commence with costal respiration of the lower ribs, and, as disease advanced, he breathed with ribs higher and higher up, so that at last he said, " I breathe with my neck;" and in truth it appeared so. His 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ribs only appeared to move. He passed through almost every variety of respiration before he died. The breathing movements are quick to change, and the inquiry is interesting, what causes the change ? One great cause is the existence of dyspnoea, a disproportion between the air passages and the volume of air to be displaced, w hich may be caused by an obli- terated state of lung, by tubercles, fluid in the pleura?, hypertrophy of the heart, aneu- rism of the great blood vessels, tumours of various kinds, the pain of local inflammation, pressure from the abdomen, whether ascites, obesity, distended stomach, gravid uterus, or any morbid growth bordering on the thoracic cavity, or lesion of nervous integrity'requisite for maintaining the respiratory movements. Such conditions of themselves would oc- casion deranged breathing movements. But again there are reasons for thinking that these movements may be changed from other causes not so purely physical; because sometimes no dyspnoea is to be perceived, and yet the movements are deranged, or they may change backwards and forwards as if aerating specific portions of the lungs, acting as a curative re- medy to some incipient form of lung disease. In complicated diseases of the chest a know- ledge of the breathing movements is highly useful. There is one condition in the res- piratory act, which is indicative of a certain state of chest, which, if not useful as a po- sitive, is at least so as a negative evidence of some existing state of things in the kings. The condition we allude to is a sinking in and bulging out of portions of integuments which cover the thoracic cavity. If we close both nostrils and make a violent inspiratory effort, the integuments between the sterno- cleido-mastoidei immediately above the ster- num, will be seen to sink inward from atmo- spheric pressure. If we open one nostril, the same is less apparent. If both are open and the passages are free, it is not perceptible. In expiration (with the same obstruction) there is a bulging outwards of these integu- ments. Sometimes, particularly in thin per- sons, this may be seen on the integuments covering the intercostal spaces. This sinking inwards is an evidence of attenuated air, and the bulging outwards of condensed air in the lungs, near to the part. It is therefore an evi- dence of some obstruction in the air passage. Difficult breathing may be attended with this feature, or not ; therefore it is an evi- dence of something existing in one state of dyspnoea which does not exist in another. Dyspnoea without this " sinking or bulging" is a proof that there is no obstruction between the air cells and the external air. But, on the contrary, dyspnoea with this " sinking and bulging," is a proof that there exists some obstruction either as a direct diminution in caliber of the air tube, or that more air is drawn through certain tubes than is natural; that this obstruction must have air on both sides of it, and that the air on one side is more attenuated than on the other. For instance, when an aneurism on one of the large vessels of a well-developed chest is pressing upon one of the large bronchi, the respira- tory sounds, and those elicited by percussion, may be good, but respiration becomes la- boured,— the case is obscure, but if there is alternate sinking and fulness of the lower part of the throat, we may be sure that there is some definite obstruction in the air passages. This, in connection with the history of the case, may lead to the detection of the cause and seat ofthe disease ; but dyspnoea without this feature could not be caused by an aneurism or tumour. In emphysema of the lung this sinking and bulging is very manifest. This circumstanceTHORAX. 1081 proves simply that there is air in the chest of different density to the external air ; and if so, there must be some impediment in the air tubes, preventing the restoration of at- mospheric equilibrium. Disease of the thoracic viscera affects the breathing movements, causing them to be more limited, or non-symmetrical, reversed, massive, interrupted, partial, quick, slow, ir- regular, or double. (a) Of limited breathing movement. — The mobility of parts when disease attacks the chest may be surprisingly drawn forth. Haller allows scarcely any mobility to the first rib; Magendie asserts that the lower ribs are immovable, because they either reasoned from the healthy body, or anatomically: but it is not uncommon in phthisical patients to see strong and well-marked respiration kept up by the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ribs, or by the 10th, llth and 12th; — these ribs are movable, but it requires disease to bring their mo- bility forth. We are satisfied that there is a latent respiratory mobility during health, which is manifested only by disease. In disease particular parts take up ex- aggerated movements, but the sum of these movements is more limited than in health. In the earliest cognisable stage of phthisis pulmonalis the expansion of the thoracic apex is diminished ; the shoulders incline forwards and inwards, and become rounded; the spine is less erect; the apex cannot ex- pand. The mobility of the inferior ribs does not so diminish, but sometimes maintains life to the last. With an exaggerated move- ment, the respiration is frequently costal and abdominal at the same time, as if no part could afford to be unemployed. In 233 cases of phthisis pulmonalis (males) in the first stage we noticed that the breathing of 46 was costal, of 96 abdominal, and of 91 costal and abdominal. The mobility by tape measure was, instead of 3 inches and upwards, as follows - — Taule F F. — Diminished Mobility over the Nipples on 233 Phthisical Males.

Generally a cavity is at- tended with non-symmetrical movements, or a dragging up of one side of the chest; and in extreme cases there is no movement at all in the region of the cavity. That symmetrical movements may coexist with extensive disor- ganisation or solidification of one lung is con- trary to the opinion of many persons. It may be explained by the fact of our having so much spare lung. It has been found by experiment that 310 cubic inches of air could be forced into the lungs taken from a man with a healthy chest (height, 5 feet 4 inches; weight, 107 lbs.; vital capacity, 198 cubic inches), the absolute capacity of whose thorax at death, was 245 cubic inches : therefore there was spare lung for more than 100 cubic inches — a space which he could not command during life. May it not be possible that when a part of the lung is consolidated or disabled, this spare portion may come more completely into use, and allow of the symmetrical movement ? (c) Of reversed breathing movements. — A man's breathing may be costal or abdominal for a month, a week, a day, an hour, a minute, and change again, — every possible alternation may occur. This may take place with or without a cavity in the lungs, with or without phthisis pulmonalis, as if a specific motion drew in air to certain parts of the lungs to excite some local change of condition. Al- though costal respiration is maintained at a greater expense of vital force, yet we see when the vital power is fast ebbing the re- spiration is always costal, and the last breath is a deep costal inspiration followed by the last expiration. (d) Of massive breathing movements. — Massive breathing is a marked feature of the presence of emphysema in the lungs. There is a total absence of that undulating, rolling, and consecutive motion of the ribs. The breathing is always costal, though it may be conjoined with abdominal breathing, and the ribs are elevated in the mass, sometimes together with the shoulders clavicle and sca- pula. Massive costal breathing is indicative of emphysema of the lungs or pneumo- thorax. In all other forms of dyspnoea the undulating movement is more or less pre- sent, though limited. (e) Of interrupted breathing movements. — In those diseases termed " nervous," parti- cularly in young women, the breathing, espe- cially the expiration, is sometimes interrupted and jerking. This appears to be merely a functional derangement; it may sound to the ear like deficient respiration, for the intensity of the " murmur" is generally diminished, as if the jerking "eased away" the expiring air. This is sometimes the case in men. It is very seldom combined with organic disease of the lungs. (f) Of partial breathing movements. — By this we mean independent movement of cer- tain ribs, or of some two or three of the res- piratory regions. All the ribs may move as in emphysematous breathing, or none of them may move, or the lower, the upper, or the1085 THORAX. intermediate set may maintain the respiratory function. Andral observes, " The partial immobility of the ribs is not without interest in a physio- logical point of view. Does not this fact prove that, in inspiration, the ribs can move independently of each other, and that they have not merely a common movement ? If," says he, " as we have often seen in phthisical patients, the lower ribs can still move when tbe upper ones remain motionless, it proves that independently of the action of the scaleni, the intercostal muscles are capable of taking, an active part in the act of respiration."* In this way respiration may be separately car- ried on by any of the twelve costal regions. We have seen a man ill of rheumatism, lying on his back, breathe solely with the diaphragm, and not present the slightest motion of any one of the ribs. And we have seen the con- trary, viz., costal breathing, without the slightest movement of the diaphragm. They can act quite independently of each other. \ (g) Of quick and slow breathing move- ments. — Not only thoracic disease, but most illnesses, particularly febrile conditions, quicken the respiration. In health the number of respi- rations average twenty per minute (Table G G), and it has been found that in 244 phthisical cases (males), the average number was from twenty-four to twenty-eight per minute (sitting) (Table 11), the highest number was forty-four per minute. There is every reason to believe that the che- mical quality of expired air is the same whether we are in health or in advanced disease, though our requirements at these two times may be very different; just as the quality of smoke from a fire is the same whether it burns briskly or slowly. — The quality is con- stant, and the required modifications are ob- tained by the difference of quantity in a given time. Quick breathing is short, and slow breathing is long, respiration. The natural time of breathing may change by habit. We have seen a man in health, whose ordinary respirations were six per minute. This extra- ordinary slowness was induced by an attack of asthma, during which attack (lasting about six years), his character of breathing changed from eighteen short, to six long and deep, respirations per minute ; though the asthma entirely left him the character of the re- spiration remained as first changed by the dyspneea. In this case the return of eighteen respirations per minute, would be to him the rapid respiration of fever, although formerly the respiration of health. Time and volume, in respiration, are the great modifiers of the energy of aeration. (h) Irregular breathing.—-Irregular breath- ing movements are less common when organic disease is present. A nervous person, as well as a phthisical person, may have every form of irregular breathing, but in the phthisical per- son the change is less frequent, and is probably due to some change in the disease ; in the * Andral, Clinique Me'dicale, torn. iv. 3d ed. 8vo. Paris, 1804. nervous person the change is frequent, some- times once or twice during an examination of the chest, Nervous breathing is generally well marked in hysteria. (i) Double breathing.—By this is meant cos- tal and diaphragmatic breathing synchronous with each other ; this is not uncommon in severe cases of emphysema, when the mobility of the ribs is much diminished. It is fre- quently met with in phthisis pulmonalis; — in ninety-one cases out of 233. We have no voluntary power to command this form of breathing in health. It is to be looked upon as a serious modification of respira- tion. All the modifications of the respira- tory movements, induced by disease, may return to healthy breathing again, if the derangement has not been kept up too long. As a general rule, the respiratory movements become natural soon after restoration of the diseased parts to health. Of the number of respirations in a given time. — The ordinary respirations should be counted without the individual being con- scious of the observation ; otherwise they be- come disturbed in number, and sometimes in character.

A sudden change in atmospheric pressure affects the number of breathing movements in a given time. We found the following limited but sudden increase of atmospheric pressure increase them as follows.

When the barometer is low we feel lassitude, and call the " day heavy," when in truth the air is lighter, and we ourselves are heavier ; when the barometer is high, we generally experience an indescribable sensation of pleasure—the vital energies seem doubled. With a sudden and considerable fall of the barometer there is a transient plethora. The blood-vessels become distended, owing to which, together with certain hygrometric changes in the air, we feel listless, and the least exertion produces perspiration. Du- hamel observed that, in the month of De- cember, 1747, the barometer in less than two days fell 1^ in., producing a change of pressure on the body of a man, of 1400 lbs.; this he ob- serves was accompanied with many sudden deaths. It is evident that with an increased pressure we get more air into the lungs with a given mobility; for, caleris paribus, air, with the barometer at 30 in. must be more dense than the same air with the barometer at 29 in. In the mine in question, we experienced a sensa- tion of lightness and vigour. The number of respirations are always increased when there is a preternatural increase in the temperature of the body. Of the Sounds of Respiration.— The breaking up of the air into minute streams was discovered by Laennec to produce certain sounds, named "breathing sounds:" which sounds are now made available in detecting organic disease in the lungs. As the air penetrates the lungs, it is divided and sub- divided until it enters the minute air vesi- cles. The air passes, 1st, through the trachea, producing " tracheal sounds," — a hollow rough blowing ; 2nd, through the next divi- sion of vessels (bronchial), producing " bron- chial sounds," less hollow and termed "whiff- ing or tubular ;" and, 3rd, into the air vesicles, producing " vesicular sound," —a soft, silky murmur like a gentle breeze among the leaves of trees. Dr. Jackson discovered that which Laennec overlooked : — this murmur is not heard in expiration, while the other two sounds are. Hence the expiratory murmur is a morbid sign, and if heard on the left side below the acromial end of the clavicle, is a sure sign of some altered condition of the air tubes, not compatible with a healthy lung. This expiratory mur- mur may sometimes be heard faintly on the right side, and not be a morbid sound ; but if strongly heard there, it is a morbid sign. A question now arises: Why is there a murmur- ing sound with inspiration and not with expira- tion ? First, let us inquire what is the dif- ference between the inspiratory and the expiratory act ? They differ in two ways : 1st. In Inspiration the lungs are passive ; the chest threatens a vacuum, and the air enters a rarefied space. In Expiration the lungs are active ; there is no rarefied space ; the air is squeezed out into the atmosphere. This does not affect our question. 2dly. In Lispiration a volume of air is broken up into smaller and smaller streams. In Expiration these small streams are collected up into the original volume by larger and larger streams. This answers the question. The hollow blowing sound in the trachea is caused by the friction of the air against the sides of the tube. The relation of the friction1087 THORAX. to the stream is the same whether the air passes into or out of the lungs, therefore the tra- cheal sounds are equally heard in expiration and in inspiration. But not so in the lungs ; here, as the stream of air proceeds it is subdivided, and with every subdivision the friction is increased; so that with every advance of the stream into the substance of the lung the sound is increased, and becom- ing more and more buried in the substance of the lung is heard as in a continual murmur. In expiration the very contrary happens. The friction is as quickly diminished, until the substance of the lung entirely masks what remains. In the larger vessels when the volume of the returning air becomes great, and the diameter of the tube more uniform, the friction is the same whichever way the air passes, and here tracheal and bronchial ex- piration are audible, during inspiration as well as expiration. If we take a sheep's lung and innate it, we hear the inspiratory murmur; let go the air and we do not hear it ; but contract part of the lung, say with the edge of a paper knife, and you hear the mur- I. In its Intensity II. In its Rhythm III. In its Character mur during the lung's collapsing, showing that by increasing the friction you produce the expiratory murmur. When any disease thickens or diminishes the diameter of the air tubes, or when one part of the lung is obliterated and another part has to do double work, then the friction is increased, and thus expiratory murmur is a true sign of some change in the minute air tubes of the lungs. Sometimes the breathing murmur is so gentle and the thickness of the muscles so great that we have even in health known the inspiratory murmur quite inaudible. In organic change of the lung these sounds become changed in their intensity, rhythm, and character. The cause of the change of sound is yet involved in much obscurity ; hence some persons have been said to have had tubercular lungs, when such has not been the case; or even extensive cavities, &c, yet time has shown that there never had been cavities. All the morbid true sounds yet require to be verified as to their cause. As we have natural changes in the character of breathing, so are there changes in the sounds of breathing, as follows : — Frequency 2. Duration f Strong or exaggerated. J Feeble. [ Absent or suppressed, f Quick. \ Slow. Jerking or interrupted, f Long. ■I Short. | Expiration prolonged, f Harsh. J Bronchial or tubular. J Cavernous. 1_ Amphoric. When there is fluid or disorganisation in the substance of the lung, there are certain crack- lings, crepitations, and gurglings, causing certain other sounds not included in the above list. Unfortunately authors differ in the ap- plication of the names for these sounds. They may be all classed under two heads, the dry and the moist, whether the tubes be large or small in which the sounds are pro- duced. For the Bibliography see that of art. " Resfiration," p. 366. (J. Hutchinson.) THYMUS GLAND.—(French,Le thymus; Italian, Timo; German, Die Britstdruse; Lat., Thymus; Greek, Ovfioc.)—It is proposed in this article to adopt the following arrange- ment : First, to treat of the gland as it exists in the human subject, comprehending its ordi- nary and structural anatomy, and its develop- ment. Secondly, to give a sketch of the comparative anatomical history of the organ. Thirdly, to treat of its physiology. Fourthly, to mention what has been observed of morbid changes occurring in it. Human Anatomy.— Sir A. Cooper's de- scription of the gland in the human subject is as follows: — "This gland is formed of a tho- racic and cervical portion on each side. The former is situated in the anterior mediastinum, and the latter is placed in the neck, just above the first bone of the sternum, and behind the sterno-hyoidei and sterno-thyroidei muscles." " Between two and three months of foetal life, as will be seen in the plate (Jig. 717.), it is so Fig. 717. 77i<? thymus, heart, larynx, &'c, o f the human foetus at rather more than two months. (After Sir A. Cooper.) small as to be but just perceptible. At three months (Jig. 718.) its increase is in propor- tion to the relative magnitude of the foetus, and thus it continues to grow gradually and equally ( fig. 719.) to the seventh month, w hen it en- larges out of proportion to its former growth. At eiglit months it is large, but at the ninth1088 THYMUS GLAND. Fig. 718. Thymus, fyc, of human fcetus at third month. {After Sir A. Cooper.') month (fig- 720.) has undergone a sudden change, becomes of great size, and is said to weigh half an ounce, from which circumstance, however, on account of the cavities which it Fig. 719. Thymus, §•£•., of human fcetus at fifth month. (After Sir A. Cooper.) contains, and the varieties to which it is sub- ject, no judgment of its bulk can be formed. It increases after birth, and continues large to the first year, when it slowly disappears to the time of puberty; and in after age it ceases to have cavities, and becomes a body of very small dimensions." He next notices the following varieties in configuration :—" Although the gland is usu- ally double, and the one side united to the other by cellular membrane only, yet it some- times happens that a third thoracic lobe exists, which appears to join one lobe with the other, but which allows, under a careful dissection, of their being separated. There are also two other varieties I have seen ; the first is the vena innominata passing through the gland, and the second, the same vein placed anteriorly to the cervical lobes. Indeed, I scarcely find two organs alike in form ; sometimes they are round, whilst others are of great length, and are so thin that the serpentine disposition of their lobes may be seen without dissection. The left gland is often larger than the right; but even in this respect so much variety is observable, that it appears if the bulk of the Fig. 720. Tliymus, fyc., of human fcetus at ninth month. (After Sir A. Cooper.) whole be the same, that it is of little import- ance which may be of the greater magnitude, the right or left gland, as its secretion will be equally abundant." The relative situation of the thymus gland to the adjacent parts is described as follows : —" In cutting through the sternum in its long axis, and then separating its two lateral portions, so as to give a good view of the mediastinum, the thymus gland appears situ- ated behind the first and part of the second bone of the sternum; and posteriorly to the origins of the sterno-hyoidei and sterno-thy- roidei muscles. It reaches more than half way down the sternum at birth, viz. to the fourth rib, and extends from thence into the neck near to the thyroid gland. It is con- nected to the sternum and origins of the sterno-hyoidei and sterno-thyroidei muscles by cellular tissue; it adheres strongly, by a coarse cellular membrane, to the pericardium ; an- teriorly and laterally the internal mammary arteries and veins take their course. The reflection of the pleura descending from the cartilages of the ribs on each side, and con- tinued to the fore part of the pericardium forming the anterior mediastinum, makes its lateral boundaries, and separates it from the lungs; posteriorly it rests upon the vena in- nominata, and upon the fascia of the thorax, which descends from the sternum and first rib to the curvature of the aorta, and to the three large vessels which spring from it." " Such, then, is the relative situation of the gland in the chest. In the dissection of the cervical1089 THYMUS GLAND. portion of the thymus, the platysma myoides and external jugular vein are first turned aside, and the origins of the sterno-niastoidei muscles are raised; when this has been accom- plished, the sterno-hyoidei appear covering and passing over the thymus gland. The sterno-thyroidei muscles . . . cover this organ anteriorly; but when they are removed, the cervical "portions of the thymus are seen on the anterior and lateral parts of the trachea, and just below the thyroid gland, where it passes on the fascia on the fore part of the air tube, and unites with the larynx by liga- ment." " The internal jugular veins are placed an- teriorly and laterally to the cervical portion, and the carotid arteries, with the par vagum, appear more externally." " The first bone of the sternum and sternal ends of the clavicle cover the junction of the cervical with the thoracic portion of this gland." " In many of the subjects which I have ex- amined, the cervical portion of the thymus passes higher upon the right than on the left side, and I have generally seen it joined by a ligament to the larynx, and by vessels to the thvroid gland." In a human foetus, at about the fourth-and- a-half month, I found the thymus consisting of two lateral portions, of which the right was the larger (in another of similar age the left was) ; this portion extended downward, lying upon the pericardium, as far as opposite the right auricular appendix, and reached upwards only to the left brachio-cephalic vein, which it did not cross ; the left extended downwards, over the pericardium, to a point opposite the middle of the trunk of the pulmonary artery, and passed up, lying upon the vena transversa, and afterwards upon the side of the trachea, be- tween it and the common carotid, till it arrived at the level of the bifurcation of the arteria innominata. The appearance of the gland in the fcetus about the middle of utero-gestation is precisely similar to that of the salivary gland in the same; it is beautifully lobulated, and sur- rounded by an atmosphere of nascent areolar tissue. In the more perfectly formed con- dition it is surrounded by an envelope of coarse cellular membrane, which penetrates the intervals of its larger divisions, unites the right and left portions together, and forms a general envelope, by which it is connected to the surrounding parts. In examining the structure of the thymus, we are conducted by two eminent guides to conclusions almost identical, though by dif- ferent modes of proceeding. This coincidence is of great value, and we can scarcely enter- tain a moment's doubt of its being founded on real truth ; it may therefore be well to notice separately the modes of investigation above referred to. Sir A. Cooper, by skilful manipulation, suc- ceeded in unravelling the gland, and showed each lateral part to be composed of a Fig. 721. The right and left thymus gland injected with wax and partially unravelled. In one are seen the rope, the lobes, and the cells, in the other the communication between'the thoracic and cervical portions. (After Sir A. Cooper.) 4 A1090 rope, on which the lobes and lobuli are set somewhat like the beads on the string of a necklace (fig. 721.). By injecting also the glandular cavities with some fluid, as alcohol, capable of hardening the tissue, or with co- loured gelatine, which sets and permanently distends them, he demonstrated the existence of a central cavity or reservoir, communicating with the glandular cavities by orifices leading into pouches situated at the roots of the lobes (fig. 722.). The central cavity forms a Fig. 122. THYMUS GLAND. Section of thymus showing the reservoir, cells, and pouches. (After Sir A. Cooper.) general communication between the different lobes ; it does not maintain a straight course, but passes in a somewhat spiral manner, be- ginning from the lower part of the thoracic portion, and extending even into the extremity of the cervical part of the gland : its size varies in different parts, being largest near the centre of the thoracic, and least at the communication of the thoracic with the cervical, part of the gland. Sir A. Cooper conceived the reservoirs to be lined by a very vascular mucous mem- brane of somewhat villous character, but this does not appear in reality to exist. Such were the principal results obtained by a most skilful and eminent anatomist, with all the appliances and aids that his science could at that day supply; they were truly valuable facts, but not so " luciferous," not so exhibit- ant of physiological meaning, as those ob- tained by a subsequent inquirer, who, availing himself of the more penetrating ken of the modern achromatic lens, and seeking rather to learn from the instructive examples which Nature herself sets forth, than from results of his own deviling and producing, has both confirmed the conclusions drawn from a less refined scrutiny, and invested them with a more correct bearing and interpretation. I refer, of course, to the admirable researches of Mr. Simon, which I now proceed to detail, respecting the structure of the thymus, as illustrated by its developement. Development. — The first trace of the or- gan which has been discovered is in the form of an exceedingly delicate tube, lying along the carotid vessels in the neck, not straight, but wavy at one part, and termi- nating by closed extremities at both ends (fig. 723.). Its wall is formed by a transpa- Fis. 723. Primary tube. (After Simon.') rent homogeneous tunic, marked at regu- lar intervals with elongated thickenings (the remnants probably of the nuclei of primor- dial cells), and enclosing granular matter, but no distinct corpuscles. There seems some probability that this tubular form, though found to prevail in very early embryos, may not be the really primitive one, but that a linear series of cells is first developed, which are afterwards blended together by fusion, so as to constitute a tube (see fig.724.); this opi- Fig. 724. --••0.. Supposed origin of primary tube. (After Simon.) nion however, I suspect, will not be confirmed; the limitary membrane of glandular and other structures has generally appeared to me to be produced quite independently of cells, so far, at least, as that it should be regarded identical with their coalesced envelopes. In the next stage of developement, the homogenous wall of the tube begins to bulge, and swell out into vesicular cavities, which at first have wide communications with the central canal or tube, and are quite sessile, but afterwards become attached by short and rather narrowTHYMUS GLAND. 1091 pedicles (figs. 725. and 726.). This budding Fig. 725. Fie. 726. Second stage of developement of primary tube forming follicles. {After Simon.) out of the primary tube does not occur simul- taneously at every part, or uniformly, but chiefly at those situations which are ulti- mately to attain the largest size ; thus in the foetal calf we find tolerably v/ell developed bulgings of the primary tube opposite the angle of the jaw, the upper part of the trachea, and the pericardium, while the intervening portions have smooth and undulated margins ; and it is just the parts of the gland corre- sponding to the above points, which ulti- mately attain the greatest magnitude. The third stage of developement consists in the ramification of the follicles which have budded out from the central cavity; — they do not usually elongate much, before they throw off fresh offsets, and these are completely sessile, so that they have the appearance of vesicles or imperfect spheres grouped together : the mode in which the primary offset divides is either dichotomous or quaternary (figs. 727. and 728.), probably also often with some degree of irregularity and inequality in the size of contiguous offsets. By the extension Figs. 727, 728. Third stage of developement. Ramification of follicles by dichotomous and quaternary division. {After Simon.) of this follicular growth to all parts of the primary tube, and by successive lateral rami- fications, occurring, as we have seen, to a greater extent in some parts than in others, the gland attains its mature size and complex structure. In this state however it consists, in very great measure, of vesicular cavities, which cluster around and completely obscure the primary tube from which they have origi- nated ; yet this primary tube or reservoir does exist, and is capable, as we have seen, of being demonstrated, so that the term which Mr. Simon has proposed, as expressing the type of the mature structure, viz. tubulo- vescicular, is sufficiently correct (fig. 729.). Two varieties have been observed in the seeond stage of the process ; one is, that " the tube sometimes bulges uniformly in its whole cir- cumference for some extent, forming a very distinct ampulla;"' the other, " that in parts where there are yet no bulgings, it is some- times flexuous, or even contorted." The observations now detailed respecting the progressive developement of the thymus, are so important in the elucidation of its structure, that I thought it very desirable to repeat them, if possible, and confirm their ac- curacy by independent testimony. I have not, however, been able to procure a foetus at a sufficiently early period to discover the primary tube of the thymus, with its smooth 4 a 21092 THYMUS GLAND. Fig. 129. Fig. 730. Diagram of fully developed thymus. Showing how the primary central tuhe is covered and concealed by the lateral developements, each of which constitutes a conical mass, a, b, e, d, with a very wide base. (After Simon.') unbulging wall, but I have seen it distinctly at a period somewhat later, when the process of lateral extension had but recently commenced. This was in the embryo of a sheep, not more than two inches long, where the thymic cavi- ties were bounded by a well-marked limitary membrane, and filled with nuclei. At the extremity of the cervical portion, thedevelope- ment of bulging offsets was much less ad- vanced than towards the middle of the gland, so that here the central tube was very appa- rent, terminating by a closed extremity, and having its margins rendered irregular and wavy by the vesicles which had begun to rise from it {fig. 730.). The developing or- gan was formed in a nidus of homogeneo- fibrous tissue, interspersed with nuclei, which was seen stretching across between the promi- nent convexities of the bulgings. At the end of the cervical portion this tissue was more abundant, and there was seen running into it a prolongation of the central cavity, which appeared exactly like a short tube, pushing on in a straight direction, and not expanding nto a vesicular cavity. In a young chicken the condition of the thymus was very similar, and the central cavity was larger than the small lateral offsets. These details, though in- complete, leave scarcely a shadow of doubt that Mr. Simon's account is perfectly correct, that the central cavity is the primary part from which the vesicular offsets successively develope themselves. This central cavity may, I am inclined to believe, in some cases disappear more or less completely; at least, in an em- bryonic sheep, three inches long, it not only bore a smaller proportion to the multiplied offsets, but its wall no longer exhibited the investing limitary tissue, and it seemed as if it jp.r*ta Extremity o f cervical portion of thymus from embry- onic sheep. 2—3 in. long. The end of the tube is closed, the central cavity is larger, the walls present numerous follicular pro- trusions of irregular size and form. Towards the middle the follicles are very much more developed. were in some measure diminishing, and losing its original distinctness. From what I have seen in the sheep, I should be led to think that the cervical and thoracic portions of the thy- mus had, in that animal at least, distinct pri- mary tubes as centres of developement, so completely independent have the two parts seemed to be of each other. Mature structure of the gland. — The results of minute scrutiny into the structure of the fully-developed thymus, accord well with those arrived at by other modes of inquir}'. Its surface, when freed from investing areolar tissue, exhibits, though in a rather coarser manner, the minutely-divided appearance so characteristic of the conglomerate glands, and this is especially evident when fat cells have formed in the interstices of the lobules, pat- terning the surface over with a network of white streaks. In a thin section taken from the gland and prepared for the microscope, the outlines of the vesicular cavities are rea- dily seen ; they are much larger than those of the salivary glands, and vary very much in size ; in a human foetus, at about the mid- period, they averaged Jg- inch, in a calf about -}-g inch, in a young guinea-pig they varied from 7V to T'¥ inch. Their form is oval or spherical, their outline distinct for about two- thirds of their circumference, but in the remaining part blended with adjacent ones, so that there is never seen any thing resembling1093 THYMUS GLAND. 4 a 3 a detached and closed vesicle. The sharp definition of the outline by a clear dark line, gives full assurance of the presence of an in- vesting limitary or basement membrane ; this constitutes a general envelope, forming the boundary of each of the glandular cavities, surrounding, therefore, the whole mass, but no- where prolonged into an efferent canal,through which the contents might escape. In structure it is truly homogeneous, that is, considered per se, but as it is closely invested by a very thin layer of areolar tissue on its exterior, it has sometimes a kind of fibrous, striated, as- pect. In all respects it closely resembles the basement tissue of other glands, and, as in them, 1 have never been able to perceive in it anything corresponding to the germinal cen- tres of Mr. Goodsir. The contents of the thymic cavities next demand our attention. They consist almost entirely of corpuscles, very closely resembling (in fact identical with) the nuclei of glandular cells; the only difference which the most careful scrutiny can detect between them, I believe, is this, that they present more nume- rous nucleoli than the nuclei of gland cells usually do. I doubt, however, whether even this is constantly the case. Their form is, I think, for the most part spherical; Mr. Simon speaks of them as generally flat and circular, but I have never observed one, if this be their real form, presenting its thin edge to the eye, as blood-discs frequently do. They vary a good deal as to the condition of their interior spots or nucleoli, some contain two or three, some as many as four or five, a few have one only, and some of the smaller none at all, but are filled with a dimly molecular substance. Their surrounding envelope is strong and well defined, as that of nuclei always is. The extreme variations in size of these corpuscles, according to Mr. Simon, are r.-^-g inch for the largest, and jTl5 for the smallest, probably a correct average, for the generality is about ^.--ji—jj. inch. Mingled with these I have found in the thymus of a calf, as well as in that of a young guinea-pig, a few larger corpuscles, about double the size of the former, of spherical form, filled either with granular matter alone, or containing also a nucleus or larger vesicular body. I am by no means inclined to regard these as cells formed upon the originally-existing nuclei of the cavities, but rather as expansions of the nuclei themselves, with formation of granular matter in their interior. It is well worthy of remark, that in the fully developed organ, before any appearance of atrophy has taken place, no other contents than those now described are found in the glandular cavities. There is none of the abun- dant granular material which forms so large a part of the epithelium of most glands, no dif- fused oily matter, the nuclei aggregated to- gether into dense masses seem to fill the ultimate vesicles completely, and there is no trace of any material which can justly be re- garded as the product of secretion.* A * The contrast in this respect between the thy- strong" solution of bichloride of mercury, in- deed, coagulates a small quantity of diffused plasma (probably the liquor sanguinis of blood remaining in the capillaries) which adheres irregularly round the neuclei, but its effect on the contents of the thymus is very different from that which it has on the albuminoid epithe- lium of the true glands. This is a remarkable circumstance, and, as yet, has not, I think, been sufficiently attended to. If we en- deavour to interpret it, it would seem to im- ply that the thymus is not truly a secreting organ, that is, that it does not separate from the blood or elaborate any special product, or in fact any product at all ; but that its func- tion is limited to the formation of an appa- ratus, which conforming closely to the type of secretory glands is yet not endowed with any analogous property. * The centres around which the material of the secretion should be evolved are present in myriads, but no gran- ular substance analogous to that of glandular epithelium is formed around them. It seems, therefore, that in the case of the thymus, the liquor sanguinis exuded from the vascular plexus through the homogeneous tunic simply solidifies into cytoblasts or nuclei, in most other glands a part takes the same organic form, — a certain number of nuclei are formed,— but these then become the centres of a dif- ferent anil more complete action, or are en- dued with peculiar attractive powers, in virtue of which the materials of the several secretions collect around them in their respective labo- ratories. Such is the fact microscopic inquiry adduces, and such the interpretation which may be offered of it; let us now turn to chemistry, and inquire whether the view we have just suggested is supported or negatived by the result of analysis. Mr. Simon gives three analyses of the thymus, which, as he states, though performed on the tissue itself, and not on its fluid contents, may fairly be depended on for conveying a sufficiently correct idea of the chemical constitution of the matters con- tained, in its cavities. Now in none of these is there any mention of any special substance which could be regarded as characterizing the secretion, on the contrary, the constituent elements are mere fibrinous, albuminous, or extractive matters and ordinary saline com- pounds, and there is none of these which might not exist in the blood, and be most readily derived from it.. This is, in fact, the con- clusion which Mr. Simon adopts ; he believes that we may express the nature of the secre- tion of the thymus as nearly as may be by the formula of Proteine, or denominate it, in physiological language, as simply nutrient matter. mus and the thyroid is very instructive, in both the limitary membrane forms closed cavities, which in the one are chiefly filled with secretion, in the other with nuclei, the accredited agents of secretory action. * Whatever may be the nature of the fluid said to be contained in the thymic cavities in which the nuclei float, it is too small in quantity, and too little apparent, to make it necessary to take it into account; certainly it never collects after the man- ner of a secretion,1094 THYMUS GLAND. Sir A. Cooper describes the vascular sup- ply of the thymus as follows:—"With re- spect to the arteries of this organ, they are principally derived from two sources. Each thoracic portion is supplied by a branch which is sent off by the internal mammary. It enters at the junction of the cervical with the thoracic part, generally on their outer side, but sometimes between the cervical portions, and, descending upon the middle of the gland, divides to supply the spirally disposed lobes. The other principal artery of the thjmus is sometimes derived from the superior thyroi- deal, at others from the inferior thyroideal artery, and, descending upon the lobes of the cervical portion, passes into them, and ulti- mately anastomoses with the branch from the mammary artery. The thymic arteries may also arise from the trunk of the subcla- vian, the vertebral, or the carotid artery, or even from the arch of the aorta. The ca- pillary network in which the arteries termi- nate, is stated by Mr. Simon to be of " the completest description. It is so arranged as to include each individual vesicle within a vascular capsule ; the capillaries are closely applied upon the transparent texture (limitary membrane) which bounds the cavities, and so exceedingly dense is their network that the meshes are of even less diameter than the vessels themselves. Every portion of the glandular substance is thus exposed in the completest manner, and at every point of its surface, to the penetration of the fluid ingre- dients of the blood." " The venae thymica?" Sir A. Cooper states " have a different course to the arteries ; for although the internal mam- mary and thyroideal veins receive small branches from the gland, yet the principal veins are those which end in the vena innominata. A considerable vein springs from each thoracic portion, and passes from the posterior surface of this part of the thymus into the vena inno- minata; having received a branch from the cer- vical portion, and vessels from the thoracic: it is found near the centre of the gland. A very small vein enters the thyroideal from the cer- vical portion, and this vein anastomoses with that of the thoracic part." Respecting the absorbent vessels of the thymus very little seems to be known ; we may, however, fairly conclude from the analogy of other parts, that they commence by a network of minute vessels, which have no communication whatever with the glan- dular cavities, and cannot, therefore, serve the purpose of excretory ducts as has been sup- posed : the glands to which they proceed are those of the anterior mediastinum. Mr. Simon describes the nervous supply of the thymus " as mainly derived from the plexus which surrounds the first part of the subclavian artery, and which has its chief origin from the inferior and middle cervical ganglia. A small twig detaches itself from this sympathetic plexus, just opposite the origin of the internal mammary artery, accom- panies that vessel in its course, and, on arriving at the point where the thymic branch arises, sends filaments along it into the sub- stance of the gland. A second source of supply is the cardiac branch of the pneumogas- tric, which gives on each side a minute fila- ment to the superior part of the gland." " In one instance I have seen a very minute fibril of the descendens noni emerge from the sub- stance of the sterno-thyroid muscle, and reach the cellular investment of the thymus ; and I have sometimes seen delicate twigs of the phrenic also detached towards the gland ; but in each case the nerve has appeared to restrict its distribution to the surface and coverings of the organ, and has not accompanied any of its vessels." The exact arrangement of the nervous fibrils, both tubular and sympathetic, in the substance of the gland is yet unknown ; but it seems tolerably certain that they accompany the vessels, enlace them with their plexiform divisions, and terminate, in part at least, in a looping manner. Early development. — The following quota- tion from Professor Goodsir's paper in the Philos. Transactions, contains his views re specting the development of the thymus and two others of the ductless glands; I am un- able from my own observation to confirm or dispute the accuracy of his opinion, but can- not do otherwise than refer to the labours of so distinguished a physiologist. " That portion of the membrana intermedia which is separated from the rest of the mem- brane, and included in the body of the embryo by the umbilical constriction, and which has not already been devoted to the formation of the heart, liver, pancreas, and external portion of the intestinal canal, is found massed along the trunks of the primitive venous system, the sides of the arches of the aorta, the terminal portion of that vessel, and the origins of the omphalo-mesenteric arteries. The portions of the membrana intermedia which are last in being converted into special organs, the Wolf- fian bodies, are the parts which project one on each side of the aorta along the posterior part of the cardinal veins of Rathke, between the intestinal plates and visceral laminae. The portions of the membrana intermedia, which remain between the upper extremities of the Wolffian bodies and the heart and liver, and which surround the origins of the omphalo- mesenteric arteries, do not become converted into organs of special structure, but retain during life the original constitution of the membrana intermedia of the blastoderma, and increase rapidly in the embryo constituting the supra-renal capsules. That portion of the membrana intermedia which is situated be- tween those two aortic arches the extremities of which become the carotid and subclavian arteries, remains during life as the thyroid body. It receives its blood from the first and second aortic arches by two large trunks on each side, the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. That portion of the membrane which passes in two parts from near the base of the cranium back as far as the ductus Cuvieri and anterior portions of the veins of Rathke, and1095 THYMUS GLAND. which are united and concentrated in front of the heart, by passing from behind forwards in harmony with corresponding motions of the neighbouring part, becomes the thymus. The structure of these organs is identical with that of the blastoderma (?). Their probable func- tion, namely, to prepare by the action of their nucleated cells, and to throw into the vascular system a matter necessary for the nutrition of the animal during the period of its active growth, a function which the observations and opinions of the majority of physiologists have assigned to them, is also essentially the same with that of the blastoderma." Development of Size.—Having now examined the anatomy of the thymus, and traced its development with a view to the exact elucida- tion of its structure, we have next to follow out the successive periods of its growth, in order to determine whether it be an organ having special relation to fcetal or to extra- uterine life. The former alternative was that to which the older anatomists, and even Sir Astley Cooper, inclined; but the correctness of the latter seems now abundantlyestablished. Meckel, Hewson, Cloquet, and Sir A. Cooper himself, all concur in stating that it continues to grow at least up to the end of the first year after birth ; and more recently the evidence accumulated by Mr. Simon from his own ob- servations and those of Hangsted have quite set this important point at rest. The following details have been selected from the copious table of instances contained in Mr. Simon's essay, they show conclusively that the gland does not attain its greatest size for some time after birth, and that after a va- riable period it gradually again diminishes. Thus in the dog, at birth the gland weighs 4"75 grs.; from 3i months to H year after it varies from 360 to 780 grs.; from 3 to 4 years it varies from 150 to 46 grs. In the cat, at birth its weight=6T grs.; from 19 to37 days after it= 30 to 44 grs.; 4 to 6 years after=20 to 3 grs. In the human fcetus of 7 months the gland weighed 33 grs. ; at 8 months 40 grs.; at birth 84 to 240 grs.; 9 months after, 270 grs.; at 21 years 40 grs. The weight of the thymus is subject to considerable varieties, which pro- bably depend, as Mr. Simon points out, partly on original differences, some individuals hav- ing naturally a larger proportion of thymic structure than others ; partly also on tempo- rary alterations in the activity of the nutrient processes, as is well exhibited in the effect of over-exertion on the thymus of lambs re- marked by Mr. Gulliver ; the size of the gland is known also to diminish when the develop- ment of the muscular system is promoted, it being found to waste away much more rapidly in young oxen used for draught, than in others not so employed. The general conclusion, which the able physiologist from whose work I have drawn so largely adopts, is, I think, truly judicious and accurate ; he estimates the period, during which the thymus persists and is active, not so much according to the space of time which has elapsed, but according to the state of the general functions of the frame : if the assimi- lating processes are active and vigorous, and the supply abundant, and the demand only mo- derate, the gland will be large and will persist long ; if on the contrary the first processes of nu- trition are imperfectly supplied, or if great mus- cular exertion creates a considerable demand, then the thymus ceases earlier to discharge its function and becomes atrophied, because the conditions no longer exist which are favoura- ble to its subsistence. Now it is obvious that in almost every individual these circumstances which so greatly affect the nutrition of the thymus may vary exceedingly, and it is there- fore impossible to state an exact numerical age as the period of the highest development of the gland ; a physiological age may how- ever with much certainty be named, and it is, as Mr. Simon states, " the age oj'early growth." The date of the earliest appearance of the thymus in the human fcetus is still little more than matter of conjecture, it has not been po- sitively detected before about the 9th week, when it is quite distinct to the naked eye, consisting of two lateral elongated portions lying parallel to each other on the upper part of the pericardium. Its structure at this time is distinctly tubulo-vesicular, but there is doubtless an earlier stage, when it corres- ponds exactly to the simple primary tube dis- covered, as before mentioned, in very early mammalian embryos. The epoch of its entirely vanishing is very variable and uncertain " about puberty it seems in most cases to suffer its chief loss of substance, and to be re- duced to a vestigiary form ;" but for several years later, even up to 20 or 25, distinct rem- nants may still be discovered of its structure amid the areolar tissue of the mediastinum. Comparative Anatomy.— In presenting a sketch of the comparative anatomy of the thymus, I can but follow the elaborate ac- count given by Mr. Simon. Mammalia.— Among the Quadrumana the thymus has, in the more anthropoid Apes, nearly the same general shape and relations as in the human subject, the cervical portion seems to be variously developed in different genera. Among Cheiroptera the gland seems to be persistent in the genera Vespertilio and Ga- leopithecus, at least so far as anatomical in- quiry has yet proceeded ; it consists of a thoracic portion embracing the base of the heart, and two cornua ascending parallel to each other on either side of the windpipe In a Bat which I dissected on the 20th of March, and which was then in a wakeful state, I could find no organ which I could positively conclude to be a thymus. On each side, however, of the root of the neck there existed a pretty large yellowish lobulated mass, resembling a good deal the aspect of a conglomerate gland. It consisted of conical lobes which were bounded and defined by a distinct homogeneous membrane exactly re- sembling the limitary tissue ; this was I think continued by reflection from one lobe to an- other, so as to form a common envelope to 4 a 41096 THYMUS GLAND. all the cavities {fig. 731.)- The lobular ca- consisted chiefly of aggregations of oil drops vities were completely filled by aggregations and molecules. Within the thorax at its of celloid particles, which were not manifestly upper part there was a similar lobulated grey- nucleated, nor provided with an envelope, but ish white mass, resting upon the lower part of Fig. 731. Convexity of lobe from oil gland of Bat. A homogeneous membrane encloses a multitude of celloid par- ticles,—the exterior row of which alone is visible, the rest of the mass being quite opaque. the trachea and the great vessels, and ex- tending round so as to come in contact on each side with the lung ; the structure of this was precisely the same as that of the masses at the root of the neck, with which however it was not continuous. I am much inclined to regard these organs as representatives of the thymus, both from their structure and situa- tion, and because I know not what else they could be ; they are not for a moment to be confounded with the ordinary adipose tissue. Among Inseclivora the thymus forms two nearly equal lobes, lying on the base of the heart and origin of the large vessels, with greater vertical than transverse dimensions. In some individuals,at least, it is not persistent throughout life, nor does it appear to be spe- cially developed. In two Hedgehogs which I dissected, one of which had been in a state of torpor until three days before death, and the other had been active and wakeful for several weeks, I found at either side of the root of the neck two roundish masses almost precisely similar in appearance to those existing in the same situation in the bat, and also two broader and thinner ones lying in the ax- illae ; but there was no trace of any such tissue in the thorax. The celloid particles were more loaded with oil than in the bat, especially in the dormant one, and in some parts they were more or less broken up and the oily matter diffused in the cavity. Re- specting the existence of a real thymus distinct from these glandular masses I am in doubt, it is not altogether easy to distinguish the structure from that of lymphatic glands several of which lie upon the great vessels at their origin from the heart. However this be it is well worth remarking, that in two hi- bernating animals belonging to different orders, peculiar organs of precisely similar structure were found ; while, on the other hand, in a mole (an animal which I believe does not hibernate) I could find no unequivocal trace of thymus, nor of the peculiar oil glands which I have described as existing in the bat and hedgehog. This would indicate the existence of the oil gland to have reference to hiberna- tion, but a more extended inquiry on this head is of course necessary before this sug- gestion could have much claim to be received. Among Carnivora the thymus, except in the cat tribe, where it seems generally to vanish at an early period, is entirely thoracic, resting upon the upper part of the pericar- dium and the origin of the vessels. When mature "it has considerable thickness and substance in the direction from before back- ward, and its right and left lobes irregularly overlap each other, so as to render the sepa- ration between them indistinct." When the gland becomes attenuated it assumes the form of a triangle, with the apex much pro- longed upwards. The thymus has been found by Mr. Simon in (young) seals, though other ana- tomists, including Meckel, who, as he says, was little likely to overlook its presence, had not observed its existence ; from this he concludes that it declines and disappears in this family, as in most other mammalia. Its form in the common seal, when pre- sent, is nearly symmetrical, consisting of two broad thickish lobes, which prolong themselves upwards to the root of the neck, and abruptly terminate by clubbed extremi- ties, which are deeply grooved in front by the left vena innominata. In the order of MarsupiaUa, three most eminent anatomists had failed to recognise the existence of a thymus, Mr. Simon has, however, discovered this gland in several in- stances, it is mostly placed on the pericar- dium, not reaching into the neck. In the fcetus of the Kangaroo it has a peculiar con- formation, being provided with a third, me- dian, lobe projecting outwards between the two others. Among Rodents the thymus differs in shape in the various genera. It consists in the rat of two elongated parallel lobes, reaching from the base of the heart to the root of the neck. In the hare it is much thicker, but still only extends to the root of the neck. In the hibernating rodents the thymus is believed to undergo at the approach of winter a re- markable alteration, apparently as a prepara- tion for the long sleep of that season. Tie- demann describes in a Marmot, which he examined in the month of November while in a state of torpor, the gland as " filling the whole of the anterior and posterior medias- tina, extending along the great vessels of the1097 THYMUS GLAND. neck to the vicinity of the lower jaw, spread- ing itself out above the clavicles on each side of the neck, and even passing behind the clavicles and pectoral muscles into the axil- lary spaces." Mr. Simon in his dissections of the same family finds the masses described by Tiedemann, as existing in the anterior and posterior mediastina, but not those in the neck, and states from microscopic examination the remarkable fact, that they all consisted of aggregations of fat vesicles. I do not ga- ther clearly from his description whether these fat cells were surrounded by a limitary mem- brane, preserving the form of the thymic cavities, in all the situations where the fat masses are mentioned as existing ; i. e. whe- ther all this fatty tissue was actually deve- loped from the thymus, or a mere accumula- tion in the ordinary way : nor does Mr. Simon state whether the specimens he examined were in a state of torpor at the time of their death or not. I confess I should wish to have fur- ther evidence concerning the accumulations of latin the marmot's thymus.—I have never seen a really nucleated fat cell, nor have I ever ob- served any approach to such a development of nuclei. Tiedemann's description indicates so strongly a great difference between the conditions of the masses in question at the commencement of winter and in the summer, that it seems to me quite necessary that a comparative examination of their minute structure at both periods should be under- taken before the question of their relation to the thymus can be decided. In Edentata the thymus is principally thoracic, the Sloth and Armadillo present small cervical prolongations connected to the larger mass by very slender strips. In Monotremata a thymus is found resting on the origin of the great vessels, and scarcely extending into the neck. Among Paclujdermata there are marked differences in the form and development of the thymus. A feetal Elephant presented a flat mass resting on the upper two-thirds of the pericardium, and sending upwards a short prolongation from its right lobe. In a Peccary the cervical portions were of great length, not only reaching to the angle of the jaw, but folded down again beside the trachea. So- lipeds have a thymus either entirely thoracic or reaching but a little way into the neck. Among Ruminants, the Calf is usually re- ferred to as exhibiting a thymus, which may serve as a type for the family. The gland presents cervical cornua which are highly developed, reach within the angle of the jaw on each side, and form large complicated masses up to the base of the cranium; below, these prolongations are narrowed, and united in close juxtaposition to form an isthmus, which passes behind the first bone of the sternum, inclines to the left side, and expands into another considerable mass of glandular substance situated on the upper part of the pericardium and covered by the left pleura. In the Reindeer the submaxillary enlargements are absent, and the tracheal are of compen- sative size. In the Fallow deer, again, the cer- vical portions are more developed, extending up to the cranium, but not reaching below quite to the pericardium. A thymus has been found in several Cc- tacea. In the foetal Dolphin there are two large median portions, pericardiac and tracheal, with deep seated lateral connecting cornua : in the Mysticete whale there were two peri- cardiac lobes, from the right one of which a prolongation extended backwards across the arch of the aorta, between the art. innomin. and left carotid till it reached the trachea, and ascended a small distance in front of that tube to terminate in two little cornua: the left lobe was of much smaller size. Aves.—In the class of birds no organ unequi- vocally possessing the characteristic structure of a thymus had until lately been shown to exist. Meckel, indeed, described in diving birds an organ which he supposed to be peculiar to them, and which he considered to be the thymus. The microscope, however, in Mr. Simon's hand has demonstrated this organ to be merely a mass of fat, and that, too, even in the youngest specimens ; the same observer has succeeded in discovering a real thymus, which corresponds closely in structure with that of mammalia at an early period of deve- lopment. It is found in the neck of very young birds, lying along the outer side of the superficial cervical vessels, extending from within a line or two of the base of the cra- nium to just above the inlet of the thorax. It appears as a semi-transparent ampullated tube closed at both extremities, and rather broader at its upper than at its lower part. Under the microscope it is seen to have walls formed by a distinct limitary membrane, and contents consisting of nuclei. The period of its dis- appearance varies somewhat, being earliest in the tribes of powerful and active flight, but in all occurring very much sooner than in mammalia. This discovery of Mr. Simon's appeared to me of so much interest, both as regards the existence of the organ in birds, and the fur- ther elucidation of its structure which might be expected from the examination of the or- gan in a lower grade of organized beings, that I was anxious to repeat the observation. The result was entirely confirmatory of Mr. Simon's description. In a chick about one week old I found on each side of the neck a tube, which appeared ampullated to the naked eye, and which under the microscope exhibited a large central cavity with numerous irregular and slight lateral bulgings {Jig. 732.). It was filled with imperfect nuclei, and with granular globules, which last were more nu- merous than usual ; there was also a quantity of oily matter in the form of minute drops or molecules. It was remarkable that on the right side the tube was divided into a number of separate portions, which seemed to have become quite isolated from each other ; this, I conceive, to have been the commence- ment of a process of degeneration, an idea which seems also favoured by the existence ofTHYMUS GLAND. 1098 a quantity of oily matter as a deposit in the glandular cavities. Fig. 732. Lower end of thymic tube from cluck one week old. Diameter at a 1-15 in. Jtepiilia. — In the class of reptiles much un- certainty has prevailed respecting the existence of a thymus gland ; it has hy some been con- founded with the thyroid, hy others denied to exist at all. The microscope has again in the same skilful hand cleared away the doubt, and rendered it certain that a true thymus is found in almost all reptiles, distinct from, and inde- pendent of, the thyroid. In young specimens of Chelonia there is found, extending upwards on each side along the carotid, or between it and the subclavian, an elongated white or yellowish mass, possessing the characteristic thymic structure, and easily distinguishable by this from the true thyroid, which lies in the median line between the carotids, near their origin. I have repeated Mr. Simon's obser- vation on a tortoise, said to be about a year old, and found in the situation he indicates an organ, which, though having to the naked eye somewhat the appearance of fat, is shown by the microscope to have the characteristic structure of a thymus. The lateral cavities are considerably more developed than in the brid, they are of very various size and some- what irregular, bounded by a distinct limitary membrane, and filled with well formed nu- clei, togother with a quantity of opaque gra- nular-looking matter consisting of minute oily molecules. In Emydosauria the thoracic portions of the thymus are large and of pris- matic shape, they meet on the base of the heart, overlapping the thyroid, and thence ex- tend upwards along the carotid vessels to the base of the skull where they terminate; in the lower part of the neck they diminish somewhat in size, but afterwards continue of uniform diameter. In several Saurians (Lacertidae, Geckos, Chameleons) the thymus resembles that just described, save that the pericardiac por- tion is absent; in adult specimens of others, as Isturius and Scincidas, no thymus has been detected, but a mass of fat exists just above the base of the heart, which may perhaps result from a transformation of the gland. In Ophidia the thymus observes one uii- deviating type of arrangement, it is found lying on each side along the carotid, often not strictly symmetrical, its lobes elongated and sometimes broken into two or more pieces. Most serpents possess a peculiar mass of fat which is developed in connection with the thymus, and often obscures or conceals it; in two specimens of rattlesnakes Mr. Simon found this fat body was absent, but is inclined to believe it exists in those which inhabit the temperate latitudes. The thymus of serpents is supposed by Mr. Simon to be persistent, and to undergo transformation into fat. From the Batrachian reptiles it was natural to expect, that in consequence of the remark- able transformation which some of them un- dergo, and the intermediate condition main- tained by others between reptile and piscine life, some important information would be gained respecting the true relation and import of the thymus. So it has proved ; for in the Frog only a mass of fat is found existing in the adult animal in the situation of a thoracic thymus, the very young animal, however, pre- sents, in the same situation, true thymic struc- ture, and the evidence of a real transformation of the gland, — not a mere replacement of it by fat,—seems more perfect than in the case of the hibernators before referred to. It was now a point of much interest to determine the condition of the thymus in the fish-like batrachian larva before its transformation had occurred ; in none of these was any trace of thymus detected, while in the youngest indi- viduals in whom pulmonary respiration had commenced the " commencement of the or-> gan" was always to be found. Mr. Simon remarks ; " The essential step in reptile me- tamorphosis is a higher developement of the respiratory system : as a part of this pro-THYMUS GLAND. 1099 cess we here find occurring the superadditidn of a thymus gland, — its first appearance in the ascending scale of organization." Among the PerennibrancMata it is very interesting to observe, that the gland is gradually suppressed in proportion as the respiration becomes more completely aquatic, a thymus is found in the Menopoma, Amphiuma, Axolotl, and Meno- branchus, but not in the Siren or Proteus ; its position is rather peculiar, it lies in the neck, on each side, along the lateral aspect of the spine, just behind that prolongation of mucous membrane which unites the branchial cavity to the pharynx. Pisces-—In fishes Mr. Simon has been unable to discover any trace of a thymus, after search- ing, carefully, in more than twenty genera ; this result accords well with the absence of the gland in the fish-like batrachian larva, and with its disappearance in the lowest Perenni- branchiata. The following are the conclusions which the eminent physiologist, so often referred to, deduces from a survey of his detailed and elaborate investigation. (1.) The presence of the thymus gland is co-extensive with pul- monary respiration. (2.) Its shape and po- sition are variable and unimportant. (3.) Its size and duration are, generally speaking, in proportion to the habitual or periodical inac- tivity of the animal. (4.) Where it remains as a persistent organ, it is usually but one of several means for the accumulation of nutri- tive material ; its continuance, under such circumstances is generally accompanied — though in some instances superseded — by a peculiar accessory contrivance, the fat body. Physiology. — The time is now past when an eminent physiologist could declare of the organs usually known as glands without ducts, "that in regard of their intimate structure and physiological meaning, they are all equally anil utterly unknown to us." With respect to their structure, it may, I think, be said, that they are as well understood, or perhaps even better than the true glands, being in fact less complex, and their constituent parts less in- dependent. Their physiological meaning, it must be confessed, is still obscure ; yet even on this dark part of the demesne of our science light is beginning to break, which we may fairly hope will continue to brighten. The results afforded by examination of the thymus in the lower animals seem certainly to connect the gland most closely with pulmo- nary organs of respiration, and it would, therefore, seem a natural conclusion, that it subserves some purpose which has to do with the aeration of the blood. It is also found that the size of the gland may vary in a short space of time very considerably, that is, that its contents are capable of being absorbed very quickly, as proved by the fact mentioned by Mr. Gulliver, that in over-driven lambs, the thymus will soon shrink remarkably, anil be nearly drained of its contents, but will be- come as quickly distended again during rest and plentiful nourishment. This seems to imply that the material necessary for the supply of the respiratory process is furnished by the thymus, which thus, in Mr. Simon's words " fulfils its use as a sinking-fund in the service of respiration." The persistence of the gland, moreover, is observed to vary considerably according to the muscular ac- tivity of the animal, thus it disappears quickly in young oxen put to the plough, it endures longer in animals of quiet habits than in the restless and energetic beasts of prey, and vanishes at a very early period in the class of birds, while it persists long in that of reptiles. From this it seems to follow, that the use fulfilled by the gland in the service of res- piration is more or less superseded when the muscular system is called into a high state of activity, i.e. when there is considerable waste of tissue yielding fuel for respiration. In the hibernating animal, where the gland, pre- parative to the winter sleep, is transformed into a mass of fat, its application to the de- mands of the respirtory process seems scarcely doubtful, as the chemical nature of the contents of its cavities is then peculiarly appropriate to neutaralise theoxydising agency of the air. Probable, however, as these views may ap- pear, they have been confronted by the fol- lowing weighty objections. An able physio- logist, in the Brit, and Foreign Med. Re- view, observes, that the condition of young, rapidly growing animals, and that of hiber- nating animals, are rather opposite than pa- rellel, that whereas in the latter, the waste of the tissues is reduced to a minimum, in the former it is certainly greater than in the adult, so that there can be no deficiency of effete material to feed the respiratory furnace. The demand in the young creature is for plastic materials, out of which the rapidly growing and rapidly changing structures may be built up and renewed. " On the other hand, in the hibernating animals all the nutritive actions are at zero, and the respiration for a long period is entirely dependent on the stores of fatty matter which have previously been set apart from the food. The demand is here for combustible materials." The writer then observes, that the che- mical nature of the contents of the thymus correspond so exactly at the two periods of active growth and hibernation to the kind of demand which must then exist in the system, that he conceives it more probable that the use of the gland at these times is different ; in the one slowly yielding up its hydro-car- bonous contents to supply fuel to the respi- ratory process, in the other performing the principal part in elaborating, by means of its myriad nuclei, fibrine from albumen, the plastic from the non-plastic element. " As the de- mand for plastic material becomes less ener- getic the thymus diminishes in size and dis- appears, the production of plastic matter within the absorbent and sanguiferous vessels being then sufficient for the wants of the sys- tem. Or if the organ remains," its struc- ture " and the nature of its function changes,THYMUS GLAND. 1100 and it cannot be deemed unreasonable to sup- pose that its use in the system should change also. In fact, that its use should be the same in the two cases, where its functions are so different, appears to us a very improbable supposition." Consonant with the above view is that of Mr. Paget, who remarks in his Report, that the fatty transformation of the thymus is an atrophy or degeneration of the gland, " analogous to that atrophy by di- minution or total removal of substance, which takes place once for all in the animals in which the thymus is not persistent. In each case the atrophy is an indication that the ne- cessity for the ordinary acts of the thymus has ceased; but in the hibernants it is, for new circumstances, made to minister to a new purpose, till at the expiration of the winter sleep, and the recommencement of new growth it begins again to be truly developed, and to form the more highly azotized organic com- pounds which it may restore to the blood for the nutrition of the fresh growing tissues." On a careful consideration of the theories now noticed (and no other are worthy of any examination), it seems to me, certainly, that the latter is nearest the truth ; and that we cannot regard the thymus in the young animal as a mere preparer of material fitted to sup- port the respiration. The following argu- ments must be allowed to weigh strongly against Mr. Simon's view. (1.) The chemi- cal constitution of the thymus, consisting chiefly of proteine and not of fatty matters, seems by no means to be such as would be best adapted to sustain the supply of com- bustible material required in respiration. (2.) The office of serving as a reservoir for ma- terial to be used in respiration may be attri- buted with much more probability to the liver*, the construction of which, as also in some measure its position relative to the cir- culatory system, point it out as peculiarly adapted for the reception of superfluous re- spirable material from the blood, and equally so for rendering it up again, when the demand again begins to be felt in the circulating cur- rent. Of this, the condition of the liver in fish, and generally in all animals, in whom the respiration is of a low type, is sufficient proof. Now as the liver is of greater relative size in the young than in the adult animal, it is not likely that this one of its functions is in any measure discharged by the thymus. (3.) The anatomical constitution o f the thymus is very unlike that of an organ winch serves * I may just briefly mention here the results to which I have been led by a long and careful study of the liver in vertebrata. Its lobules (if it is so divided) are not penetrated by excretory ducts, nor are the secreting cells contained as in most other glands in the cavities of ducts, they lie naked in the interstices of a close plexus of most delicate-walled, capacious, capillaries, from which they readily re- ceive the materials they are intended to act on ; and to which they as readily render up their elaborated products when these are called for. The excretory ducts, consisting at their origins almost solely of nuclei, attract into their cavities the oleo-biliary secretion with which they are bathed; probably, however, in so doing altering it to some extent, as a reservoir of respirable matter. For this purpose we should expect to find a fluid stored up in cavities, such as the oil of the fat vesicles, or the oleo-biliary matter which collects within the cells of the liver; the ana- tomical elements, however, of the thymus are totally different, being mere nuclei, with no trace even of commencing cell development, in fact, just that part of a glandular appa- ratus which is not the secretion, however im- portant a part it may play in the elaboration of it. (4.) The transformation of the thymus into fat previous to the winter sleep, con- currently with the formation of other fat masses in the axilla;, indicates, as above shown, very strongly that the gland in its natural state fulfils some purpose different from that to which it is subservient during hibernation. But as there can be no doubt that it undergoes this change for the sake of the respiratory function, — to fit itself for supplying those de- mands during the long period when the waste of the tissues is reduced to a minimum, and no ingesta are taken,—it seems tolerably cer- tain that while the gland continues in its normal unchanged state, its action must be of a different kind, not having special reference to the function to which during hibernation it un- doubtedly ministers. The circumstance quoted by Mr. Simon from the writings of Mr. Gulliver, respecting the remarkable shrinking of the thymus in over-driven lambs, cannot be re- garded as proving that the contents of its cavi- ties are thus absorbed soldi/ for the use of re- spiration. It is more probable that they are resumed into the blood, which has begun to be impoverished by fasting and exercise, in order that they may go to supply the nutrition of all parts indifferently. With regard to the argu- ments adduced by Mr. Simon from Compara- tive Anatomy, to the effect that a thymus has some essential connection with pulmonary organs of respiration, I would remark that though it is certainly of weight, yet it can- not be regarded as proving absolutely that the two organs are co-related in function. It may be that they are only simultaneously developed, — connected together in virtue of some law of organized being which requires their coeval appearance, and yet not intended to minister to a common pupose.* I grant that observing their consentaneous appear- ance, one should inquire whether they be not essentially linked together in function, but if this be not proved by subsequent inquiry, or a fortiori, if it be shown to be unlikely, then the argument arising from their co-develop- ment ceases to have much force. But if we decline accepting the theory pro- posed by Mr. Simon, are we to close, uncon- ditionally, with the other which has been above expounded, and which is but a modifi- * This is perhaps the more probable, seeing that the thymus does not assert its connection with organs of respiration taken generally, but only with a particular modification of them, so that its exist- ence is determined not so much by the degree in which the function is fulfilled as by the mode. Hence it is absent in the higher fishes and in insects.THYMUS GLAND. 1101 cation of a former opinion, that of Cowper and Haller, who regarded the thymus as belonging to the class of conglobate glands. It appears on the whole more consistent with the various facts bearing on the subject which are in our possession, and yet it is by no means proved, and is open to some objections. In the first place, one is inclined to look sus- piciously on any hypothesis, which assigns the production of a material almost universally diffused throughout the body to any separate organ, it seems far more truth-like to regard the manufacture of the plastic element (fibrine), as taking place in the blood itself by the agency of the white corpuscles, as Drs. Addison, Williams, and Carpenter, have well nigh demonstrated to be the case. If their view be correct, it becomes still more impro- bable that the thymic nuclei should be the producers of fibrine, seeing that they are al- together dissimilar in appearance and struc- ture from the white granular corpuscles. Moreover the early disappearance of the thymus in birds, long before the demand for plastic material can have materially dimi- nished, makes it unlikely that in them its function is the elaboration of fibrine. The same observation applies to mammalia though in a less degree; and, generally, I think there can be little doubt that the self-forming, self- sustaining blood, while supplied with an ade- quate quantity of proper nourishment, is fully capable of evolving within itself all that is requisite for the nutrition of any part of the system. It seems almost unwise to broach any further speculations respecting this ignotum quid, especially after stating objections to the views of others ; and yet while ideas are of- fered as mere suggestions, to serve if they may as aids to the discovery of truth, they are not without utility, since none can say without trial which of these " scintilla;" may kindle the light of truth. From the careful investigations which have been made respecting the age at which the gland attains its highest develop- ment, and the conditions which chiefly affect its size and repletion, it certainly appears to be a very exact exponent of the state of the nu- trient processes generally,—a delicate barome- ter of nutrition, as Mr. Simon terms it. More- over its anatomical constitution, as 1 have insisted, seems to show that it does not truly secrete, i. e. elaborate and separate some pe- culiar principle from the blood, but that it is a congeries of (nuclear) particles, which can only be regarded as solidified liquor sanguinis, and not in anywise as a true secretion, espe- cially when we remember that in every such fluid the nuclei of the producing cells sooner or later disappear. Chemical analysis, as we have seen, confirms this position ; the formula expressing the nature of the contents of the thymic cavities being identical with that of proteine. Now if one of the organs which belong to the class of ductless glands have for its func- tion to act as a living attractive recipient or reservoir for the blood cn masse, may not an- other fulfil its destined purpose by serving as a reservoir for that part of the blood which ministers to nutrition, perhaps for the plastic element of the liquor sanguinis in particular? When such plastic material is in superabund- ance in the circulating current, a quantity of it passes off, and solidifying in the thymic cavities, assumes that most universal of all organized forms, the form of nuclei.* When there is again a demand for such material, the solidified particles would again liquefy, and re-enter the impoverished blood. It is not difficult to understand that such a func- tion may be most necessary during the pe- riod when growth is most active, the sup- plies of nourishment most frequent, and the waste of the tissues most rapid, but that as the several nutrient processes, both of the assimilative and destructive kind, attain to more steadiness and equilibrium, diminishing somewhat in their intensity and rapidity, but increasing in real strength, firmness, stability, and perfection (one is obliged to use somewhat metaphorical language), it may no longer be requisite, and the organ will therefore undergo a gradual atrophy. This hypothesis, which is really little else than an expression of the facts above noticed, has been principally suggested by the con- sideration of the nature of the secretion (so called) of the thymus, wherein it differs ab- solutely from all other glands, in as much as the nuclei constantly remain in their primitive state, and are not even mingled with granular matter ; while it agrees in this respect with another organ of similar kind, the spleen, whose parenchyma consists of similar bare nuclei, which exert so far as we know no real secretory action. It is however by no means improbable, that, even if this guess at the use of the thymus be correct, we are yet very far from being fully acquainted with all the rea- sons why it exists, and why in such a situa- tion, and under such a form. If Mr. Goodsir's account of its origin, from a portion of the blastoderma, with the suprarenal capsules and thyroid, be correct, it is possible that its formation may be demanded by some recon- dite law of development, in virtue of which the extraction of one organ out of the pri- mitive blastema necessitates, by a kind of compensating action, that another should arise in some sense complementary to it. This idea, originally stated by Treviranus, has been developed very ably and pleasingly by Pro- fessor Paget, to whose lectures 1 refer for a full exposition of it. Morbid Anatomy. — Not much is known, and probably there is not much to be known, respecting the morbid conditions of the * I would liere direct attentionto the remarkable fact, that in all glandular, and in fact hi almost all, organs, the nuclei are almost precisely similar in size and appearance, and do not differ from each other in different parts more than individual ones do in the same. Does not this indicate strongly a tendency of liquor sanguinis effused in conditions of healthy nutrition, to assume the form of nuclei, irre- spective of the situation or special endowment of the part where it is effused ?1102 THYMUS GLAND. thymus. Absence of the gland has only been observed in cases of acephalism, where the brain and many other parts are simultane- ously deficient, while in cases of anence- phalism, where the brain is also wanting wholly, but the general development much more complete, the thymus is present; no- thing therefore can be concluded from its absence in cases of extreme monstrosity as Mr. Simon has well observed. Inflammation of the gland, if it ever happens, is of rare occurrence. Professor Hope, however, refers to a case by Mason, in which an abscess of the thymus is said to have opened into the trachea. The same author states that Becher and Hangstadt have collected about fifteen ex- amples of persons, of different ages, affected with more or less general tubercular disease, in whom the thymus was found involved. " It was for the most part considerably en- larged, very firmly united with surrounding parts, and either converted by tubercular in- filtration into a hardened mass, or else par- tially destroyed by tuberculous softening. In three or four instances calcareous concretions, probably resulting from the retrogression of tubercle, were discovered in the gland." Haller speaks of the thymus as being fre- quently affected with scirrhus along with the conglobate glands ; but though Becher gives an instance on his own authority, and refers to others, there can be no doubt that true malignant disease of the gland is extremely rare. Sir A. Cooper gives a case, in which death was produced by the pressure of an enlarged thymus upon the vena transversa and upon the trachea, probably also upon the vagi nerves; there was severe dyspncea and oedema of the lower extremities. He considers the disease to have been of the fungoid kind, i. e. encephaloid. Atrophy of the thymus occurs as a normal event; if, however, it should take place long before the usual period, determined, as we have seen, not so much by the lapse of time as by the condition of the system, it must be regarded as morbid. Yet in every such case it is almost certain that the atrophy of the thy- mus would be but part of a general malady, wherein the nutrition of every organ was greatly impaired. Hypertrophy of the thymus has attracted more attention, Dr. Kopp having noticed several cases of suddenly fatal dyspncea oc- curring in children, in whom the gland was found of large size, concluded that there was some essential connection between the glan- dular enlargement and the suffocative pa- roxysms. The fallacy of this opinion has been well pointed out by Mr. Simon and others. I must refer to his work, and that of Professor Hope, for a full account of their arguments, and will only mention two circumstances, which seem to me conclusive upon the point. The first is, that "thymic asthma" may occur with an unnaturally small thymus ; the second, that when a thymus, enlarged by malignant disease, as in Sir A. Cooper's case, does oc- casion dyspncea, it is not sudden and pa- roxysmal, but constant and exhausting. For the history of the thymus, and for a copious list of authors who have written upon it, I can do no better than refer to the Historical Introduction to Mr. Simon's essay. (C. Handfield Jones.) THYROID GLAND. (French, glande thyro'ide; German, Die Schilddruse ; Italian, Tiroidea glandola ; Latin, Glandula thyroidcea.) The organ which has received this name is a bilobed glandular body, situated in the human subject in close proximity to the larynx, from the prominent cartilage of which it has pro- bably derived its appellation. Its size varies considerably in different in- dividuals, according to unknown peculiarities. In the female it is generally larger than in man ; reversing thus the proportion which obtains between the vocal apparatus in the two sexes, and so far negativing the idea, that the larynx and the thyroid gland are in any wise intimately connected. The normal weight of the thyroid is about one ounce, according to Cruveilhier. Any great excess above this must be regarded as indicating a pathological condition. Its form, as has been said, is bilobed ; the lateral lobes being united by a thinner and narrower portion termed the isthmus. It would appear (from the circumstance that variations of form are most frequent in the isthmus, which sometimes is even wanting) that the lateral lobes are the primary parts of the gland, and, in fact, in one entire class (that of birds) the lobes lie entirely separate, one on each side of the trachea. In the human subject they are large and solid, presenting an anterior convex surface, a posterior concave, an external and inferior border which is con- vex, and runs up to join the superior interior concave border in a pointed cornu, which reaches as far as the origin of the inferior con- strictor pharyngis from the ala of the thyroid cartilage. From the upper border of the isthmus, or from the adjacent part of one of the lateral lobes, there stretches upwards a narrow strip of glandular tissue, which has been called the pyramid or mesian column, and which may have been sometimes mis- taken for a muscle, as Cruveilhier asserts ; though it is distinguished perfectly from the so called levator gland, thyroid, by Haller. This prolongation sometimes extends to the hyoid bone, but generally not so far, and is subject to numerous modifications of shape and structure. The following list of the various forms which the thyroid may pre- sent, is taken from the catalogue of the mu- seum of Guy's Hospital, which Dr. Birkett, the curator, most kindly allowed me to inspect, together with the preparations. 1. Thyroid without an isthmus, but having two mesian columns. 2. Thyroid almost without an isthmus, and having one mesian column. 3. Thyroid with broad isthmus and one mesian column. 4. Thyroid with no isthmus, but having one large mesian column. 5. ThyroidTHYROID GLAND. 1103 without isthmus, having one column (right), and an isolated portion on the left. 6. Thy- roid with one lobe only developed, and a little glandular body below the middle of thyroid cartilage. 7. Thyroid gland replaced by a membranous substance, two small por- tions only remaining. 8. The gland with isthmus and two mesian columns. It is important to ascertain accurately the situations and relations of the thyroid. I give them as they are stated by Cruveilhier, and confirmed by my own observation. The isthmus lies across the first four rings of the trachea, the first not being completely co- vered.* Its upper margin is about half an inch below the inferior border of the cricoid carti- lage : from it the mesian column passes up- ward, lying upon the crico-thyroid muscle, the thyroid cartilage, and the thyro-hyoid membrane. The lower border of the isthmus is free, and occasionally descends so low, that there is not space between it and the sternum to perform the operation of tracheotomy. Posteriorly, the isthmus is firmly attached to the rings of the trachea by close and dense areolar tissue. The sterno-hyoid and sterno- thyroid muscles overlap the greater part of the isthmus ; a small portion, however, in the median line is covered only by deep cervical fascia, and perhaps crossed by some branches of origin or communication of the anterior jugular veins. The lateral lobes, concave posteriorly, embrace, and rest against the sides of, the trachea, the cricoid cartilage, the in- ferior and lateral parts of the thyroid car- tilage, and the lower part of the pharynx and upper part of the oesophagus. " These lobes form, with the connecting isthmus, a half or sometimes three fourths of a canal, which surrounds all these parts. This re- lation, one of great importance, explains how certain goitres flatten the trachea late- rally, hinder deglutition, and finally bring on a real asphyxia from strangulation."-)- The posterior border of the lateral lobes corre- sponds to the vertebral column, and rests upon the carotid artery; but, if enlarged, it extends further outward, and lies upon the jugular vein. Both recurrent nerves ascend behind the lateral lobes, and are closely in relation with them as they pass under the lower edge of the inferior constrictor muscle. Anteriorly, the sterno- and omo-hyoid muscles pass in front of the lateral lobes, the sterno- thyroid is stretched as a thin band over their surface, and in cases of considerable hyper- trophy may be seen sunk in a deep groove formed in their substance, or, as Cruveilhier states, expanded to a width double or treble its natural size. These muscles separate the thyroideal lobes from the sterno-cleido-mas- toid, which, with the mastoid artery and the superficialis descendens on its inner surface, overlaps their greater extent, as it passes backwards and upwards to its cranial attach- ment. " The superior extremity of each of * There is probably some variation in this, ac- cording to the varying depth of the isthmus, f Cruveilhier, Anat. Descr. the lateral lobes terminating in a point, whence the bicorned form which has been attributed to the thyroid body, corresponds on the inside of the carotid artery to the lateral and posterior part of the thyroid car- tilage, and extends sometimes even to the neighbourhood of its upper border. The inferior extremity, thick and rounded,descends more or less low in different subjects, and corresponds to the fifth, sixth, or even to the seventh ring of the trachea; it is situated between the trachea and the common carotid artery. By the inferior extremity the inferior thyroid artery reaches the gland." " The superior border is concave, and skirted by the superior thyroid arteries." The inferior is convex, and has branches of the inferior thyroid running along it. The thyroid gland is of a red or reddish yellow colour, of tolerably firm consistence, and gives to the touch the sensation of granulations. Cruveilhier, thus describing, proceeds as follows : " This organ presents all the anatomical characters of glands, and, like them, is separated by dissection into glandular grains" (doubtless meaning the acini of Malpighi) ; "but there is, be- tween these glandular grains and those of ordinary glands, this difference, that in the thyroid gland the glandular grains communi- cate with each other, while in the others they are independent." He then details the result of mercurial injection, to show that the glan- dular grains, or granulations, have a vesicular structure, and communicate with each other ; this latter statement, however, is certainlv erroneous, as we learn from more accurate modes of investigation. The presence of a certain amount of secreted fluid, in the natural condition of the tissue of the thyroid, and the accumulation of a similar material in larger quantities under certain morbid con- ditions, the eminent French anatomist justly regards as evidence of the thyroid possessing a secreting apparatus ; but, at the same time, faithful to the results of accurate dissection, he acknowledges that no excretory duct can be found leading either into the trachea, the ventricles of the larynx, or the foramen caecum of the tongue, whither earlier ob- servers had, with too nice refinement, sought to trace its course. Far truer and more phy- siological than such straining after uniformity is the conclusion he adopts: " I think that there exist, in the economy, glands without excretory ducts, such as the thymus, the supra- renal capsules, and the thyroid gland. The li- quid produced in the gland is absorbed entirely, and fulfils unknown uses." I have thought it worth while to follow this accurate and trust- worthy anatomist through his account of the structure of the thyroid, though it be some- what antiquated, partly for the sake of the confirmation it affords to the results of a more recondite and powerful analysis, and partly that we may observe how securely we may trust Nature's own teachings, even svhen they may appear, for a time, contradictory to established doctrines, as doubtless it mustTHYROID GLAND. 1104 once have been considered that a gland should exist unprovided with an efferent duct. I now proceed to give a more detailed account of the structure of the thyroid gland. Its surface is somewhat uneven, — a natural condition which is often greatly exagge- rated in hypertrophy of the gland ; it is tra- versed by several large branches of the nutrient arteries, which ramify over it before they plunge into its substance. A thin fibrous expansion, continuous with the sheath of the cervical vessels on each side, forms a capsule which invests the gland, and from whose inner surface septa dip into the interior, dividing its substance into lobes and lobules much after the manner of a conglomerate gland ; these fibrous septa are often well seen in sections of hypertrophied specimens. A thin slice of the thyroid, examined under a low power of the microscope, displays its con- stitution very perfectly and readily (fig. 733.) It is seen to be made up of closed vesicles, aggregated together in groups of various size by the fibrous expansions just described. The form of these vesicles is primarily spherical ; but many, perhaps the majority, are more or less affected by mutual pressure, being trian- gular, elongated, ovoid, or oblong. They are all perfectly closed, the wall being formed by an homogeneous limitary membrane, which is easily traced all round, and can never be seen passing off' into a neck, or blending with the envelope of an adjacent vesicle. Where a number of vesicles lie closely crowded to- gether, the homogeneous envelopes are of course in contact, or separated only by the interjacent vascular plexus ; but those form- ing the surface of a group are invested by a thin expansion of fibrous tissue derived from the general capsule. The diameter of the vesicles of the human thyroid I have found to range from -^Vcr inch to Fie. 733. 'A group of vesicles from the thyroid gland of the bullock. They contain the vesicular epithelium, and that consisting of nuclei and granular matter, in varying proportions. inch; in the bullock, from -^Vo Hlcn *° inch ; the greater number averaging about 3^ inch, in this animal as well as in the pig. In the mesian column I found, at least in one instance, that the structure was essentially the same as that of the thyroid itself, only that there was a much greater amount of fibrous stroma, which resembled more nearly ordinary areolar tissue, containing both the white and yellow element. The vesicles are lined internally by an epithe- lial stratum, consisting usually of nuclei set closely together in a scanty basis substance {Jig- 734.), which is either feebly granular, or of a somewhat oily aspect. The nuclei are at once recognised by the practised eye as exactly resembling those of the true glands. Their nucleoli are not always visible, and vary Fig. 734. Fig. 735. Epithelium from thyroid of bullock. Epithelial particles fro thyroid of rabbit Diameter^ in. very much in number — from one to four or five. The nuclei are, however, always vesicu- lar, bounded by a strongly marked envelope and have a mean diameter of a„1ou th inch. It has been observed by Mr. Simon, and I have occasionally had the opportunity of1105 THYROID GLAND. confirming the remark, that the nuclei, instead of remaining in their primitive condition, pro- ceed to the further stage of cell development ; this lie has noticed both in man and in several of the lower animals. I should say that it is certainly a circumstance of rather rare oc- currence ; but it is worth remarking, that it may be artificially produced by adding to the specimen some coagulating re-agent, which speedily solidifies a film of albuminous plasma around the nuclei, and thus produces very good imitations of cells. The epithelium of the thyroideal cavities often assumes the form of small vesicles larger than the nuclei (see Jigs. 736, 737, 738.), and easily distinguished Fig. 736. Vesicle from thyroid of Hedgehog, lined by an epithelium consisting of a double row of pellucid delicate vesicles, 5JUin. diam. from them.* The diameter of these in a hu- man subject averaged 2U\,,, inch; in a bullock, about T7Vo inch They are, in their natural state, perfectly spherical, but often somewhat angular from mutual pressure. Their contents are a very faintly granular or pellucid material, which does not surround a nucleus except iu some rare instances, where there may be seen an imperfect trace of one. These vesicles, which I thus name to distinguish them from the nucleated cells occasionally met with, exist in the glandular cavities, sometimes alone, sometimes mingled with the ordinary form of epithelium in varying proportion. I am in- clined to believe that they originate in the nuclei, which undergo a kind of expansion, at the same time losing their nucleoli. This opinion needs further confirmatory evidence; * I am obliged to use the same word (vesicle) in speaking of the large glandular cavities, and of the epithelial particles which line them; the dis- tinction between them should, however, be carefully borne in mind. VOL. IV. it is, however, certain, that they are not de- veloped upon pre-existing nuclei. The layer of epithelium is generally of no great thick- ness, not occupying more than one eighth or one sixth of the distance from the envelope to the centre of the cavity; in the rabbit, however, it appeared to be more abundant, encroaching considerably on the interior, which, in this instance, was not filled with the characteristic glistening secretion. In a sec- tion prepared in the ordinary way, a large quantity of epithelium is broken up, and may be seen strewn over the field. Not unfre- quently, however, the nuclei adhere firmly together; and sometimes, as in the pig, I have seen the greater part of the lining of a cavity detached entire. The contents of the cavities are for the most part a clear, somewhat refracting, homo- genous material, which is manifestly the pro- duct of secretion, and fills all the spaces not occupied by the epithelium : this fluid is some- times contained in small vesicles TiTr to ^-nrr inch diam. (Jigs. 739. and 740.) which have a Fig. 739. o Two vesicles containing a transparent matter and no epithelium. From thyroid of Bullock; the larger 2Jj in., the smaller _JU in. diam. Fig. 740. Two vesicles from thyroid of Bullock, having a thicker lining of epithelium than usual, and each containing a single vesicle, whose wall, of homo- geneous membrane, surrounds the central cavity of the original vesicle. well marked, structureless envelope, but are destitute of any thing like epithelium. They may be seen occasionally in the interior of the glandular cavities, and also floating free in the field of view, having been perhaps detached from cavities opened by the section. The exact import of this circumstance does not appear ; for I cannot regard them as newly formed glandular vesicles, developed within the original ones in an endogenous manner. Were this the case they would occur more frequently, and would exhibit some traces of epithelial lining. Large crystals, sometimes 4 B me. 738.THYROID GLAND. 110.6 of well marked prismatic, sometimes of oeto- hedral, form, are seen occasionally in the glandular cavities. They are generally single in each, and I have no other guide than their form to lead me to any opinion respecting their chemical constitution. I have seen, in a human thyroid, some large oval or circular corpuscles about -j^Vo mcn diam., consisting of coarse granular matter not surrounded by any distinct envelope, and of an opaque dead white colour. These were perhaps ab- normal formations ; yetin a tortoise,wherethe gland was quite healthy, similar corpuscles, and more numerous, were observed. The clear fluid material, contained within the glandular cavities, is generally spoken of as of an albuminous nature. This opinion seems con- firmed by two analyses of the gland, made by my friend Mr. Beale, which may be regarded (after allowance is made for the areolar tissue, vessels, envelopes, and epithelium) as express- ing pretty correctly the chemical nature of the secretion which forms so large a part of the whole bulk. These analyses I will presently quote, but will first detail a few observations of my own, as to the effects of certain re- agents on the fluid in question. Liq. Potasscc, added to a thin section pre- pared for the microscope, rendered it much more transparent, partially dissolving the epi- thelium, and leaving a quantity of oily matter diffused throughout it. Acetic acid now added to the specimen pretty nearly restored it to its former appearance, but did not bring into view any precipitated protein. Acetic acid, alone, dissolves in part the epithelium of the vesicles, and renders the fibrous tissue more transparent. Liq. Ammonia dissolves the epithelium in great part, but does not alter the transparent contents of the cavities ; nor does liq. potassae or acetic acid. Solution of iodine does not materially affect the epithe- lium of the cavities, but renders it more opaque. Strong nitric acid at first renders the epithelium more opaque and granular, but does not manifestly affect the contained secretion. After a time it colours this material bright green or yellowish green, and disengages a great many bubbles of gas. A saturated solution of bichloride of mercury, even after long maceration, does not seem materially to affect the secreted contents of the vesicles; it makes their peripheral stratum of epithelium quite opaque; but the interior still appears transparent and glistening. The chief conclusion deducible from the above results is, that the secreted material of the glandular cavities of the thyroid is not ordinary fluid albumen ; as otherwise it would certainly be coagulated by the agents em- ployed. The effect produced by nitric acid is also worthy of notice, though I cannot ex- plain the meaning of it. Analysis of thyroid gland. Human. Ox.

Thus much, however, seems to be ascertained, or rendered very probable. (1) That the secreted material is of an albuminoid nature. (2) That it is not in the state of ordinary fluid albumen. (3) That gelatine is sometimes an ingredient of the secretion; (it was found in the gland of an ox, but not in that of the human subject, and consequently could not have been derived from the fibrous tissue). (4) That though crystals of triple phosphate and of oxalate of lime occur in the cavities, no urea nor lithic acid, nor in fact any special organic compound, can be detected.* Vessels. — The vascular supply of the thy- roid is very abundant, and completely justifies Cruveilhier's opinion, that more than a mere process of nutrition is carried on in the gland. The arteries which are distributed chiefly to this organ are very constant in their number, and tolerably so I think in their respective dimensions, though in this respect they vary inversely with regard to each other. They ordinarily arise, as has been well remarked by Mr. Simon, just beyond the points where the arteries to the brain are given off" from the large trunks,—a circumstance which he con- ceives to be very significant of the function of the gland which they supply ; — the two superior thyroideal arising one on each side from the external carotids, almost immediately after the bifurcation of the common carotids, and the inferior thyroideals from the intra- scalenal portion of the subclavian, almost opposite the point where the vertebrals are given off. A fifth thyroideal artery occa- sionally exists,—that named after Venbauer; taking its origin from the arch of the aorta or thearter. innominata. The superior thyroid not unfrequently takes origin a little lower down from the division of the common carotid, or even from its trunk ; or it may arise higher up from a common trunk with the lingual. It courses first forward and inward, when it is * I would not omit to express here my obligations to Mr. Beale for undertaking the analyses, and for the care and skill with which he has performed them.1107 THYROID GLAND. 4 B 2 covered only by the deep fascia and platysma; but it soon turns vertically downwards, and runs beneath the sub-hyoidean muscles to the upper extremity of the gland, where it divides into three branches; one of these runs be- tween the thyroid gland and the trachea, a second skirts the external border of the lateral lobe, while the third, running along the inter- nal border, forms an anastomosis with the cor- responding branch of the opposite side. The inferior thyroid is noticed by Cruveil- hier as one of the arterial branches most liable to vary in its origin,—an opinion which, emanating from a less high authority, [should have been inclined to question. It may arise, acccording to him, from the common carotid, the arch of the aorta, or the arleria innomin- atn. (The supra-scapular often, less commonly the posterior scapular, and sometimes even the internal mammary, spring from the com- mencement of the inferior thyroid, which is therefore called the thyroid axis.) Its course is peculiar ; it runs at first straight upwards, then comes downward, and again ascends to reach the inferior extremity of the lateral lobe of the gland. It passes in front of the trachea, and behind the great vessels and vagus nerve : , the connecting cord of the sympathetic descends behind it to the middle cervical ganglion when it exists, which is then almost constantly found, as it were, seated astride upon the vessel, exactly on the convexity of its first curve. Like the superior thyroid", it has three terminal branches, one running along the in- ferior border of the gland, another breaking up over the posterior face of the lateral lobe,"and a third which penetrates between the gland and the trachea, ami anastomoses with the one of the opposite side along the upper border of the isthmus. (Cruveilhier). The capillary plexus, in which the minute branches of these arteries terminate, is dis- posed in the form of hollow spheres around the glandular cavities, closely applied upon the limitary membrane and forming a continuous network throughout the gland. It is tolera- bly close-meshed, but not nearly so much so as that of the liver or kidney. The diameter of the capillaries, in a recent injected specimen, varied from inch, and the interspaces were, I think, two or three times as large. There are corresponding vence comites to the superior and inferior thyroideal arteries. The superior thyroid or thy ro-laryngeal returns its blood either into the internal jugular vein, or into the common trunk of the facial and lingual, before it joins either of the jugulars. The middle thyroideal runs down and turns aside, crossing the common carotid to enter the internal jugular. Besides these there exist constantly another pair of veins, which run down in front of the trachea involved in the deepest layer of cervical fascia, and terminate either by opening both into the vena transversa, or the left into this trunk, and the right into the junction of it with the right brachio-cephalic. These veins run down, gradually diverging from each other ; so that, from being at their origin no more than one third of an inch apart, they are separated at the lower part of their course by an interval of about an inch, or rather more. In this situation they are often united by a transverse branch, and are said, by Cruveilhier, to form, with the tracheal and laryngeal veins proceeding to unite with them, a considerable plexus, which it is impossible to avoid in the operation of tracheotomy. These veins correspond in some measure with the thyroideal artery of Venbauer, but are much more constant, and are sometimes three or four in number; so that the blood they re- turn is not proportioned to that conveyed by the artery. The lymphatics, originating probably in a closed network, proceed to enter the deep cervical glands. They may sometimes be seen filled with a concrete albuminous substance, which they have probably taken up from the glandular cavities. Nerves.— The recurrent laryngeal, shortly before it passes under the margin of the in- ferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx, gives off some filaments to the thyroid gland ; some are also furnished by the external laryngeal ; while a plexus, derived from the middle cervical ganglion, proceeds along the inferior thyroid artery, and is distributed to the gland along with its branches, forming communications with the preceding. In thin sections of the thyroid treated with acetic acid, I have seen the nucleated bands of the sympathetic, con- taining one or two caelio-spmal tubules, running for some distance in the interspaces of the vesicles ; they probably terminate by forming a looping plexus ; but I have not been able to ascertain anything certain on this head respecting either these or the tubular fibres. Development. — The thyroid is said by Cruveilhier to be developed by two lateral halves, which are subsequently united by means of the isthmus. This statement seems to be confirmed by the condition of the gland in several of the lower animals, where the lateral lobes continue separate, lying on each side of the trachea ; and is also supported by the occasional occurrence of a similar dispo- sition in the human subject. In my own researches it has not occurred to me to observe this mode of development, perhaps because I have not examined spe- cimens at a sufficiently early period ; however, in an embryonic sheep only two inches long, where the thyroid was distinctly visible, it presented the usual appearance—the lateral lobes being connected by a narrow isthmus ; the same was the case in a human foetus of 4i months ; the isthmus, however, being wider, and not appearing to be of at all more recent development than the lateral lobes. In the embryo of the sheep just mentioned, the gland was of an opaque whitish aspect, differing materially from its natural reddish colour; it consisted principally of nuclei, with a small quantity of granular matter. Scarce any trace of a vesicular arrangement existed ; but the whole mass was surrounded by an investing membrane very nearly homo- geneous in texture. In another embryonicTHYROID GLAND. 1108 sheep, three inches long, the thyroid was much more of its natural reddish, semi-trans- lucent colour; still there was scarcely any vesicular arrangement, the mass consisting almost entirely of nuclei aggregated together. The thyroid of the human foetus just men- tioned was of the same grayish aspect as that of the smallest of the embryonic sheep. It also consisted chiefly of nuclei, but these were to some extent collected together so as to form solid globular masses (fig. 741.), not Ms. 741. Incipient vesicle from thyroid of human foetus, at about mid-pei iod. It is a solid mass of nuclei, not enclosed in a distinct envelope. yet, however, quite definitely isolated, nor surrounded by homogeneous envelopes. This, however, seems to be the way in which the vesicular cavities are developed ; the limitary envelopes being formed around the primitive nuclei, which assume the arrangement of epi- thelium. The thyroid is of larger relative magnitude during intra-uterine existence and infancy than in after life, — a fact which seems rather opposed to the view which regards this gland as alternating its action with that of the brain. Comparative anatomy of thyroid.—The existence of a thyroid gland in all the Mam- malian orders seems to be undoubted ; and though it is probable that, by a close and ex- tended survey of the various families, some interesting and perhaps instructive peculiarities might be detected, yet I have not the oppor- tunities necessary for undertaking such an inquiry, and can only record one observation where some deviation from the ordinary con- dition was discovered. This was in a Rabbit, in which the organ presented the vesicular arrangement much less manifestly than is usually the case. The epithelium consisted of small imperfect celloid particles, disposed so as to form hollow spheres ; but there was scarce any appearance of secretion in the included cavities, which were small, and might at first have escaped observation. For the following summary of the compa- rative anatomy of the thyroid in birds and rep- tiles, I am principally indebted to Mr. Simon's paper in the Philosophical Transactions. In Birds, there are found, in all the va- rious orders, two glands, situated one on each side of the trachea, very near the lower larynx, and frequently attached to the jugular veins. They possess the characteristic struc- ture of the thyroid body, consisting of a dense aggregation of closed vesicles, which contain a kind of epithelium, and are invested by a close capillary network applied over their homogeneous envelope. The position of these glands with respect to the larynx seems to be neither essential nor constant; it is however stated by Mr. Simon, that it " always corre- sponds to a particular spot of the vascular system, viz., that it lies on the cervical vessels, and receives its supply of blood just opposite to the point at which the vertebral or carotid arteries diverge to their respective destina- tions." The following are the details of a mi- croscopic examination which I made of these glands in a Pigeon. They consist of closed vesicles about ^ig. inch diameter, having their homogeneous envelope lined by a rather thick layer of epithelium, so that the cavity is proportionably contracted, sometimes not being more than T2-£ro mcn diameter The epithelium consists, for the most part, of nuclei and granular matter. Some of the nuclei are very perfect, and show a distinct vesicular struc- ture, with a well marked peripheral nucleolus. Others are more like granules, solid and opaque, and not above half the size. The nuclei are imbedded in granular matter, which for the most part is diffused freely about, but occa- sionally, though very rarely, constitutes the contents of a cell. In some cavities the epi- thelium assumes the form of non-nucleated delicate vesicles, of rather large size (fig.7-^2. b.). No secretion, capable of being recognised by the eye, exists in the glandular cavities. Ms. 742. O © poo From the thyroid of a Pigeon. a, 'b, Two vesicles.

Reptiles.—In the order Chelonia the organ, which is demonstrated by the microscope to be really the thyroid, is found occu- pying a definite and uniform position. It lies in the median plane of the body, immediately above the base of the heart, between the two carotid arteries, a ndis overlapped and con- cealed by the pericardial lobes of the thymus. The structure of the gland in a young Tor- toise I found extremely well marked; the ve-1109 THYROID GLAND. sides were large, J-jto-^inch diameter, closely aggregated together, and very variously altered from the spherical form by mutual pressure. There was very little investing areolar tissue. The epithelium consisted of a single row of nuclei imbedded in granular matter, which was more abundant than usually is the case. In some parts this had almost disappeared, and was replaced by delicate vesicles larger than the nuclei which lay closely together in contact with each other. Whichever of these forms the epithelium assumed, it did not en- croach much on the cavities of the vesicles, which were large and filled with some trans- parent non-refracting fluid. Most of the cavities also contained one to three yellowish coarsely granular globules, TJ__ to -j-A^ in. diameter ; these existed in va- rious stages of development. A fine large octohedral crystal was also seen in one of the cavities ; but there were no prisms of triple phosphate (Jig. 743.). Among the various families of the Saurians the thyroid is found to occupy different posi- Fig. 743. One side of a vesicle from thyroid of Tortoise.

Even in the same family its arrangement is not always uniform ; thus among the Lacertidce the gland is single, and of considerable breadth in the true liz:trds while in the Monitor it is double. Among the Iguanides, likewise, a similar variety prevails. The GechotidcB, Chamaekonidce, and Seincidce present the same general form as the true lizard. In the Chamaeleon it is rather higher (nearer the os hyoides) than in the other families, and is overhung by the sacciform dilatation of the larynx. In the Amphisbania and Opkidia "thegland lies just above the base of the heart, between the right and left carotid arteries. It is a little hidden by the thymus of each side ; and in those genera which possess a fat body this large organ lies conspicuously in front of both the thymus and thyroid." In the Batrachian order there has been found, in the common Frog, on each side a small glandular body, which Mr. Simon de- clares is unquestionably possessed of true thyroid structure. They are situated on the carotid arteries, just beside the cornua of the hyoid bone. Huschke conceived these bodies to have their origin in the shrinking of the branchiae, and endeavoured to establish that the thyroid generally had its origin in the transformation of the branchial arches in the early embryo. This hypothesis, however, Mr. Simon well remarks, appears refuted by the existence of the gland in a pcrenni-branchiate animal, the Menobranchus, where it consists of two symmetrical portions connected with the inferior border of the os hyoides, one on each side. In the class of Fishes there seems yet some doubt whether a true thyroid gland really exists. Mr. Simon believes that he has discovered the organ in many fishes, enumerating the Carp (Cyprinus), Pike (Esox), Cod (Gadus), Had- dock (Morrliua), Whiting (Merlangus), Eel (Anguittd), Sturgeon (Accipenser), Shark (Squalus), and Skate (Raid);—it seems also to be present in the Anableps, Exocoetus, Cal- lorhynchus, and Lamprey (Petromyzoii), but the evidence for its existence is less conclusive. It may occupy, he states, either of three posi- tions ; (l) as a single organ situated in the median line in connection with the basibran- chials, and supplied with blood from the first branchial vein while yet within the gills. (2) " In the Gadidae the gland is double. One portion lies on each side, not, as in the last case, at the anterior extremity of the first branchial arch, but near its posterior or ver- tebral end. Here it occupies part of a recess which is bounded by the gill below, and above by the outer extremity of that transverse fold of mucous membrane which limits the extent of the palate. It is merely covered by mucous membrane, which leaves it apparent to the eye without need of any express dissection. Its vascular supply is reflected to it from the ophthalmic artery, which arises before the formation of the systemic aorta from the first branchial vein close to the origin of the pro- per encephalic artery." (3) " In the carp, anableps, pike, and exocoetus, the gland is placed at the inner extremity of the same duplicature of mucous membrane, and more toward the palate, so as to lie upon the fibres of the pterygoid muscle." Though there is this variety of situation, yet Mr. Simon re- gards these several organs as constantly agree- ing in one point, viz., in deriving their vascular supply from the first branchial vein, and thus being brought into connection with the ence- phalic nervous centre,by their nutrient streams having origin from a common source. Pro- fessor Owen dissents from the view that the pseudobranchias are the analogues of the thy- roid gland. He states that in osseous fishes they are not diverticular to the cerebral circu- lation, but only to the ophthalmic, and in most cases are subsidiary, in this respect, to the cho- roid vaso-ganglion. The sublingual gland of Retzius is the organ which Professor Owen considers as most nearly representing the thyroid, though he suggests a doubt as to whether, by reason of its relations to the heart and great vessels, it may not more properly be regarded as the analogue of the thymus. It is with some hesitation that I proceed to mention the results of my own examination of some specimens from the three classes pointed out by Mr. Simon, in which he seems to regard the presence of a thyroid as un- doubtedly ascertained. I have, however, care- fully examined the structure with the micro- scope in every instance, and I believe I mayTHYROID GLAND. refer to the observations, so far as they go, as free from any material error. In the Skate I have found the organ described by Retzius as a salivary gland, and by Mr. Simon as a thy- roid, occupying the situation well described by the latter, and lying exactly upon the terminal division of the branchial aorta. It was of a faint reddish gray tint, and presented to the unaided eye the appearance of a conglomerate gland. No excretory duct, however, was ob- served proceeding from it. In structure it consisted of numerous vesicles aggregated to- gether. The form of these was mostly circular ; some were elongated, and many variously altered by mutual pressure. Their diameier was about ^ to JT inch (Jig. 744. A). The limiting envelope of the vesicles presented a ■Fig. 744. From thyroid of S/iate. A. Vesicle, in. in diameter. B. Several of the nuclei imbedded in diffused mottled substance. good example of homogeneous membrane. It was lined internally by a pretty thick stratum of epithelial substance, which in some instances was so abundant as almost to fill up the cavity. The epithelium consisted of nuclei and a very large quantity of rather coarse granular ma- terial, which quite obscured the nuclei them- selves (Jig. 744. B.) There were also a few granular cells, and, in the interior of many of the vesicles, imperfect prismatic or octohedral crystals could be discerned. I could not discover, among the glandular structure, any tubes resembling excretory ducts ; so that I am much inclined to believe it has no relation to the salivary organs, but belongs to the class of ductless glands. A gland, however, it assuredly is, and not a mere vaso-ganglion. Resides this body I discovered at some dis- tance behind it, just at the junction of the branchial arches anteriorly, a small light red- dish mass, which was covered in by a thin fascia, and by the mucous membrane, and could not be seen till the latter was dissected off. Its structure was almost exactly similar to that of the organ just described, con- sisting of vesicles about -^fe to TiTr inch diameter (Jig,. 745.), with a thick interior stratum of epithelium resting on a beautiful homogeneous limitary membrane. The pseu- Fig. 745. A vesicle from sublingualgland of'Skate, diam.js in. It contains abundance of nuclei and granular matter, with delicate vesicles. dobranchia, situated on the anterior wall of the spiracular canal, is manifestly of entirely different structure to the organs described. It consists of small plicae of mucous membrane, covered by a kind of paTement epithelium. In a Dog-fish (Spihax) the pseudobrancbia was very small, but distinct. 1 could discover no trace of the sublingual gland, or of the small one behind it which I found in the skate. In the cod and whiting the pseudobranchia is situated, as Mr. Simon has described it, near the upper extremity of the first branchial arch on each side. It lies in a recess which is bounded by the gill below, and above by the outer extremity of that transverse fold of mucous membrane which limits the extent of the palate. Its structure is peculiar; Mr. Simon regards it as a thyroid ; but from this opinion I feel obliged to differ. The following description is taken from examination of the organ in the Cod, but applies equally to that in the Whiting. It is a body of light red colour, semi-transparent aspect, flattened so as to present two faces, about one line and a half in thickness, and having two borders, one convex antl slightly notched, the other somewhat concave. The surface is slightly uneven or nodulated. It is enclosed in a cap- sule, through which some large vessels are seen ramifying. Its general aspect is that of ''glandular flesh," and certainly not of a mere congeries of vessels. In structure it appears to consist of parallel folds of homogeneous membrane, beneath which is spread a vascular plexus, and which are covered by an unusually developed epithelium. This epithelium appears under the form of granular cells of an oval, circular, or irregular form, not distinctly nu- cleated, and having a diameter of-..I1„ou inch. These do not appear to constitute a mere in- vestment, but to form a layer of some thick- ness, filling up the intervals between the adjacent processes or folds of homogeneous membrane. These organs, manifestly con- structed after the type of gills, evince thus a tendency to assume a glandular structure; yet I can see no sufficient reason for sup- posing them to represent the thyroid, from which they differ so entirely in structural characters. In the whiting I could detect no trace of a sublingual gland, nor of the small posterior one; but in the Eel, where thelilt THYROID GLAND. 4 b 4 pseudobranchia was absent, I found, by the aid of the microscope, between the first and second basibranchials, a small mass, which consisted in great part of fat, but contained also some large vesicles closely resembling those of a real thyroid. Their diameter varied from ^-L. to inch. They had an ho- mogeneous envelope lined by an epithelium, consisting of small non-nucleated pellucid cor- puscles, and surrounding a cavity filled by a transparent somewhat refracting fluid. In aPieuronectid I found the pseudobranchia quite free, uncovered by mucous membrane, and projecting a series of small distinct leaf- lets into the branchial cavity. It differs essen- tially from that of the cod or whiting, and showed no tendency to assume a solid glan- dular form, but was manifestly a real though minute gill. In a Carp I found the pseudobranchia with some difficulty. It was situated very deeply between the anterior part of the upper ex- tremity of the first branchial arch, and the posterior border of the pterygoid muscle. Its structure was entirely that of a gill, consisting of parallel folds of a membrane, arranged transversely to a median axis, and overlaying a vascular plexus. These folds were covered with a kind of scaly epithelium, which was often detached in large pieces, and mingled with some circular cells, closely resembling mucous globules. I could find no trace of the sublingual nor of other adjacent gland. From the few facts now detailed I think it may be concluded, (I) That there is no evi- dence from their structural characters to prove that the pseudobranchia? are the representa- tive of the thyroid. (2) That in some in- stances organs which seem to be of a totally different kind are found, which resemble very closely the structure of the thyroid when it unquestionably exists. Mr. Simon lays stress upon the circumstance, that the pseudobranchia? a>nd the sublingual gland re- ceive their vascular supply from the same source, viz. the 1st branchial vein ; this, how- ever, is not constantly the case, the pseudo- branchia? in osseous fishes, according to Pro- fessor Owen, serving only as diverticula to the ophthalmic, and not to the cerebral circulation; so that on this ground they cannot be sup- posed to have similar functions. For a philo- sophical discussion, however, of the analogy and homology of the pseudobranchia to the thyroid, I would refer to Professor Owen's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 270. note. Mori'HOLOGY. — The preceding details are abundantly sufficient to prove the glandular nature of the thyroid. This truth, which elder anatomists saw clearly, though rather afar off, we, by more intimate and minute scrutiny, are enabled to confirm and establish in every par- ticular. Let us take in order the several parts of the secretory apparatus of the thyroid as we have described them, and see whether they do not exactly correspond to homologous parts in any undoubted gland. The recep- tacular cavities, enclosed by envelopes of homogeneous membrane, manifestly represent the tubes of the kidney or testis, or the ter- minal vesicles of the salivary gland. The limitary tissue is identical in appearance in each ; but disposed in the one so as to form shut sacs ; in the others to ensure a pervious canal or outlet, for the secretion. In the true glands the limitary tissue or basement membrane supports, on its interior, a layer of epithelium, essentially consisting of nuclei and granular matter. The same tissue in the thyroid is lined internally by a similar layer, which differs only in the smaller quantity of granular matter interposed among the nuclei, and in both cases the formation of perfect cells (i. e. with envelopes) is uncom- mon. The exterior of the limitary tissue is in contact, in all the true glands, with a capillary plexus, from which the materials for the nutrition and growth of the epithelium are furnished. The same disposition exists in the thyroid. A certain amount of fibrous tissue, or some modification of it, penetrates more or less extensively among the elementary parts of the true glands, and serves to pack and unite their component parts together ; this also we have had occasion to describe in the thyroid. With respect to a supply of lym- phatic vessels and nerves, it is sufficient to state, that as far as ordinary dissection can go, the thyroid is similarly circumstanced with the other glands ; and there is no reason to doubt that the actual arrangement of these parts in all is the same. The parallel, thus exactly sustained in every particular, warrants us in regarding the thyroid as the rapacity fia of the class of ductless glands, and it may be not without advantage, if we take occasion to note, in the other organs belonging to the same class, how gradually the strongly marked characters are laid aside, till the glandiform organ passes into a modification of vascular structure. In the supra-renal capsules the limitary membrane, though described by an eminent anatomist as usually forming tubes of various length, enclosing celloid epithelial particles, is, according to my observation (which is however but limited}, very faint, or entirely absent. I have never been able to discover it in the human adult or fcetal sub- ject ; and in the sheep the cortical structure has seemed to consist simply of rows of celloid nucleated particles, without any enclosing membrane. Conceding, however, that in these organs the limitary tissue does exist, there can be no doubt that it is much more feebly de- veloped than in the thyroid, while, as a set off", the epithelial particles are more perfectly formed. In the case of the thymus the limitary tissue is well marked, and resembles very much, in its arrangement, that of the con- glomerate salivary gland ; but the epithelium is remarkably modified. The nuclei exist, but almost alone. No granular matter of any pecu- liar properties is formed around them, prepa- rative to, and evidencing the existence of, secretory action. In the spleen both these alterations coincide. The epithelium is reduced to mere nuclei aggregated in masses round prodigiously developed venous radicles, and1112 THYROID GLAND. the limitary tissue is discoverable nowhere, not even surrounding those curious spherical masses of nuclei the white corpuscles of" Mal- pighi. The only circumstance I know of, which seems to indicate that even in the spleen a kind of secretory action does occasionally take place, is, that there frequently occur, in the parenchyma, some peculiar yellow cor- puscles, which are most abundant in fishes, and of which I gave a detailed account some years ago. The very presence, however, of these (for they are by no means constant), as well as their condition, argue strongly that secretion is not the appointed function of the splenic parenchyma. From this, the last and lowest of the ductless glands, we descend to erectile tissue, in which the venous portion of the sanguiferous system is even more highly de- veloped than in the spleen, and where the intervening parenchyma is still further reduced in quantity; yet, from the phenomenon of afflux of blood to the part, it must be regarded, I think, as exerting an attractive force, as is unquestionably the case in the spleen.* Returning from this digression to the con- sideration of the thyroid, we may lay it down as fully established, that it is a gland whose secretion is formed, and collects, in closed cavities. Now from this fact we are able easily to deduce another, viz., that the secre- tion when formed is capable of being absorbed from the receptacuiar cavities; for otherwise these would go on enlarging and distending themselves indefinitely, as in fact they do under certain morbid conditions. But, though there may be various causes concerned in the production of bronchocele, yet I think it must be regarded as proved, by Mr. M'Clcllan's inquiries, that certain waters are adequate of themselves to produce this disease ;—it would appe'ir that when they are drunk, some in- gredient or principle is supplied to the blood, which, being in excess, is straightway elimi- mated by the epithelium of the glandular cavities of the thyroid, and thus collects in, and distends them. If a patient in whom this has occurred be removed from using this unwholesome water, and if the natural ab- sorbing power be aided by the influence of iodine, then, the supply of the substance for which the thyroid has a special attraction being cut oft", the excess collected in the receptacuiar cavities returns speedily to the circulating current, which now, being in a minus condition as to this principle, readily resumes it. In such cases there seems, in fact, to take place a very analogous process to that which occurs in ordinary fattening and emaciation ; if an excess of oily matter exist in the blood, old fat vesicles enlarge, and new ones are formed ; if the reverse is the * The well marked variation in size of the spleen at different times proves, I think beyond doubt, that it exerts an actively attracting force on the blood which traverses it; else what possible reason can be given for its containing- much more blood at one time than at another ? No contractile tissue exists here which can be supposed to obstruct the returning current by the splenic vein. case, the oil in the fat cells is readily absorbed into the blood circulating in the capillary loops around them. The condition in which the epithelium of the thyroideal cavities is usually found is worth observing, and seems susceptible of a probable interpretation. It may be stated as a pretty well established fact, that the nucleus of a cell is the essential part, that in it resides that influence, or is developed that force, which produces all the phenomena of growth and assimilation ; that, so long as the nucleus persists, the energy of the cell, if one has been formed, continues to be manifested ; but, if it has disappeared, the active life of the cell is at an end. It is also certain that the comple- tion of a cell, i.e. its being surrounded by an envelope, is by no means an essential circum- stance ; that all the purposes of cell life may be effected by the mere aggregation of granular matter around a nucleus ; that, in fact, the cell wall or envelope is of no importance, or but very little, in the metabolic changes which are produced, and that its presence, when it exists, seems merely to denote a certain per- manence of duration in the particle. Many examples of the correctness of these state- ments, will occur to every one who is in the habit of examining the glandular organs in man or the lower animals. I believe we may also advance a step beyond these doc- trines, and regard it as very probable that, when we find an epithelial structure con- sisting principally of bare nuclei, with but a scanty interposed quantity of granular matter, the secreting action there effected is of a rapid and simple kind; the destined pro- duct being quickly formed and thrown off, and not slowly evolved within the chamber of a cell. The following instances may be re- ferred to, as illustrating the extreme varieties of secretory action in reference to this par- ticular. The cells in which the spermatozoa are formed must be of considerable per- manence, the development of the filaments taking place gradually, and in one instance, as Mr. (ioodsir has shown, only being completed in the spermatheca of the female. The biliary cells of various annelida are at first filled with pale granular contents; but gradually these are replaced by the characteristic molecules with which the cell becomes at last distended, and thus remains, often for a long time. The cells of the kidney of the common snail, which are very perfectly formed, enclose, within a well marked envelope, an opaque white mass of uric acid, which, after a long time, may increase to such a degree as com- pletely to fill the cell. These cells are very permanent.* In contrast to these instances, wherein complex and elaborate products arc formed in complete cells by a secretory action of a slow and deliberate character, we may refer to (I) * I preserved some snails in a box for about a year—they remained in a perfectly torpid state, and took no food. The renal cells at the end of that time were almost all fully distended with uric acid, while usually they are not more thau half full.11 13 THYROID GLAND. the absorbent glands, which doubtless produce some change in the fluid which traverses them ; this, however, must necessarily be a rapid process, and, accordingly, scarce any cells are formed; the mass of the glandular paren- chyma consisting of very perfect nuclei; (2), the terminal hepatic ducts, whose walls, as I have shown, consist almost entirely of nuclei set close together, and which, by means of these effective agents, eliminate the actual biliary secretion from the varying, partly biliary, partly oily, fluid formed by the hepatic cells on their exterior ; this process of elimi- nation is, I believe, continually going on, and is not so much of a metabolic as of an ab- sorbing nature; the essential change being probably effected by the hepatic ceils of the Lobules; (3) the nucleated tissue forming the principal part of the villi, which scarce ever devclopes cells,* but is constantly attracting the chylous fluid through the basement mem- brane from the cavity of the gut, and permit- ting it to pass off" by the efferent lacteals (here scarce any chemical change appears to take place) ; (4) the cineritious matter of the cerebral hemispheres, which, amid the rapid alternationsof sensation, thought, and volition, must be undergoing incessant change, consists, in by far the greater part, of nuclei and granular matter, the fully formed vesicles being few and far between. Applying, now, these views to the case of the thyroid, there seems reason to believe that the ordinary condition of its epithelium is such as to adapt it for rapid and transitory action ; so that a large amount of secretion may be quickly thrown into its cavities on any sudden occasion ; which again would easily transude through the thin epithelial layer and homo- geneous tunic, when the time of action had passed by. It may also be remarked, as consonant with the views above stated, that as respects its chemical nature the secretion of the thy- roideal cavities is of a simple kind, not appa- rently requiring much elaboration. It seems, in fact, to be a mere modification of albuminous matter containing, it may be, some gelatine, but strongly contrasting with the highly wrought products of the renal and hepatic laboratories. This implies that the change effected by the thyroideal epithelium on the liquor sanguinis supplied to it is by no means considerable. Use. — Cruveilhier, writing about fifteen years ago, briefly says, " the use of the secre- tion of the thyroid is unknown ; " nor can the anatomist of the present day give a much more satisfactory account. So en- veloped in mystery the use of the gland seems to have been always regarded, that inquirers have been more willing simply to confess their ignorance than is usually the case, and fewer speculations and hypotheses have been broached respecting this than regarding other points which promised at first sight to be of easier solution. It is scarcely worth while * I venture herein to differ from Professor Good- sir, not without repeated aud careful observations. to mention the opinion, which supposes the thyroid to have any essential connexion with the larynx, either as pouring into it, through supposed ducts, a fluid fitted to lubricate the lining membrane, or, as Sir A. Carlisle sup- posed, forming a protection to the delicate organs of the voice, against the variations in temperature of the external air. There seems no doubt that the relative position of the thyroid to the larynx is quite unimportant, so far as the function of the organ is con- cerned. This is borne out by the variations of its site which occur in birds, and by the results of morbid action ; since prodigious goitre does not induce disease of the larynx, except in a mechanical way, i.e. by injurious pressure. Passing over more crude conceptions, we come to consider a theory which has been propounded by Mr. Simon, and which has certainly every claim to our careful attention, both from the character of its author, and as it is the only one yet promulgated which can be said to be even probable. He considers that the thyroid acts as a diverticulum to the cerebral circulation ; exercising, at the same time, its secretory function in an alternating manner with the encephalic nervous mass. His words are, " What diversion is to the stream of blood viewed quantitatively, alter- native secretion would be to the composition of blood viewed qualitatively ; and I should conceive that the use of the thyroid gland, in its highest development, may depend on the joint exercise of these two analogous func- tions. I should suspect not only that the thyroid receives, under certain circumstances, a large share of the blood which would other- wise have supplied the brain, but also that the secretion of the former organ bears some essential relation (which chemistry may here- after elucidate) to the specific nutrition of the latter ; that the gland,—whether or not it appropriates its elements in the same proxi- mate combination as the brain does,—may, at all events, affect, in a precisely similar degree, the chemical constitution of the blood tra- versing it ; so that the respective contents of the thyroid and cerebral veins would present exactly similar alterations from the characters of aortic blood. Finally, I should suppose that these actions occur only, or chiefly, during the quiescence of the brain, and that when this organ resumes its activity the thyroid may probably render up again from its vesicles to the blood, in a still applicable form, those materials which it had previously diverted from their destination.'' This theory mainly rests on the circum- stance that the thyroideal arteries arise in close proximity to the cerebral, and this is I think sufficiently constantly the case to form a strong argument in its favour. It must be remembered, however, that variations in the place of origin of the arteries both of the brain and thyroid, do occur without, as far as we know, any interference with the full discharge of the functions of the gland ; and it may also be considered probable that the purpose of a diverticular stream would have been betterTHYROID GLAND. 1114 attained, if the origin of the vessels had been below instead of above the point of giving off of the arteries to the brain Besides, however, this argument, two others may be mentioned which at least favour the same view. One is, that no special characteristic principle appears to exist in the secretion of the thyroid, but that it is a mere modification of albuminous matter,—this seeming to imply that no special use is served by the secretion of the gland, that it is not elaborated for the sake of pro- ducing any peculiar effect on some other part, but that it is simply secerned from the circu- lating current for a time, to return and mingle with it again in a condition but little altered from its primitive one of blood-plasma. The other argument is drawn from the con- dition of the epithelium, which, as we have before remarked, seems adapted for rapid and transitory action, so that it might quickly secrete a large amount of material on any diminution of the nutrient processes in the brain. These arguments may be allowed to possess some weight. Before, however, this theory can be regarded as at all established, a more sure and discriminating chemistry must prove some relation of composition to exist between the secretion of the th} roid and the grey nervous matter. Till this is done we can but deal with the question afar off, without bringing it to an exact issue. Morbid Anatomy.—The following morbid changes have been observed to occur in the thyroid; (0 It maybe affected with com- mon inflammation. (2) It may be variously altered by unhealthy or perverted action of its own glandular structure. (3) It may be the seat of adventitious formations. (4) Its vessels may become remarkably enlarged, as in the so called aneurism by anastomosis. Inflammation. — Professor Hasse gives the following description of inflammation occur- ring in the thyroid. " It is rare, but may at- tack the organ cither when healthy, or when enlarged by previous disease. Its course is more frequently chronic than acute. Within a very brief interval the gland often swells considerably, becomes very bloodshot, tense, and painful, its texture softened and friable, assuming at first a brown red, and ultimately a dingy gray colour. The morbid anatomy of this grade of inflammation is but imper- fectly known ; that of the suppurative stace has been more frequently observed, and more fully described. Either separate ab- scesses form, or else the entire gland is converted into pus. Under favourable cir- cumstances the abscess opens externally through the skin. There are, however, ex- amples of its obtaining vent through the oesophagus, and determining a protracted fistula of the gullet,* or of its discharging itself into the trachea, and producing death by suffocation.f After evacuation of the pus, together with numerous shreds of dead cellular tissue, the tumour collapses ; the gland on the * linger, Beitrage zur Klinik der Cliirurg. vol. i. f Meckel. side affected shrivels into a hard, cellulo- filamentous knot, which adheres firmly to the skin and to the surrounding parts. Some- times the shrivelling of the one gradually brings on wasting of the other lobe." Alterations of Structure. — Under the se- cond head may be included hypertrophy of the thyroid, or some enlargement without appreciable change of texture. " This variety,' Prof. Hasse states, " is frequent, and for the most part inconsiderable." It probably depends merely on distension of the glan- dular cavities by their accumulated secre- tion. This change is almost wholly " confined to youth, and is frequent about the age of puberty in both sexes,— more so, however, in the female." " Alternatives of increase and decrease are especially apparent in this kind of bronchocele, enlargement being most con- spicuous at the approach of the menstrual period." This form, though it may be called hypertrophy, is not quite strictly so desig- nated, as there is no formation of new glandu- lar tissue, but only distension of the original cavities, by an increased quantity of secretion. " Meticerous degeneration of the thyroid is one of the most frequent forms. It occurs at all ages, and is uniformly attended with intu- mescence. It may involve the organ in whole or in part. In the former case the component granules (or vesicles) are found unusually and unequally enlarged, and transformed into sepa- rate cells filled with a tenacious, viscous, jelly - like substance, of the colour of honey. The entire part is hard, nearly bloodless, and but loosely coherent with the surrounding parts. Where, as frequently happens, only certain portions aredisorganized, these form spherical tumours varying in size, and imbedded clearly in the healthy structure. They present a brownish or yellow colour, and the consistency of jelly or of melted glue. Sometimes they appear as an opaque, reddish, soft, or even lardaceous, swelling. In general but few blood vessels are visible in this goitre,although it may now and then be associated with ex- uberant vascular growth." The foregoing description is quoted from the translation by the Sydenham Society of Professor Hasse'swork. He does not, how- even seem to notice sufficiently, under this head, the variety of matters which are found in the enlarged glandular cavities. Cretaceous matter, either in a pulverulent state, or form- ing hard ossiform masses, I believe often occurs, and in Prep. 1498, of the Patholo- gical collection in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, there is seen a quantity of solid white substance, either opaque and soft, or transparent, firm and chondroid, which oc- cupies the larger cavities, the majority being filled with a transparent jelly-like material; some also with cretaceous matter. One in- teresting instance, probably belonging to this class, is quoted in the Cyclop, of Pract. Medi- cine from DeHfien:—"In cadavere horren- dam mole thyroideam nactus, publice dissecui.

Hie enim steatoma, ibi atheroma, alio in loco purulentus tumor, in alio hyda- trius, in alio erat coagulatus sanguis, fluidus fere in alio, imo hinc glutine loculus plenus erat, alibi calce cum sebo mista." I may mention here the results of micro- scopic examination of a specimen of this form of enlarged thyroid, for the opportunity of making which I am indebted to the kind- ness of the medical officers of St. George's Hospital. The gland was greatly enlarged ; its surface somewhat nodulated. A sec- tion displayed a number of cavities visible to the naked eye, some of which were circular, others elongated, and as it were compressed. Many of them were about the size of a large pin's head; some however, much more capa- cious. The majority were filled with a slightly opaque, firm, gelatinous material ; but some (the larger) with cretaceous or ossiform matter, and some also with a reddish material. The intervening structure in several places appeared tolerably natural; but even in this, on close in- spection, enlarged vesicles were perceptible. The areolar tissue separating the lobes of the gland was hypertrophied, and formed whitish septal bands. Under the microscope it was seen that the vesicles were generally enlarged. They were found of all sizes, from those that were distinctly visible to the naked eye, or still larger, down to the natural size. Their walls were somewhat but not uniformly or very greatly thickened. The homogeneous envelopes presented, generally, somewhat of a fibrous appearance. The greater number of the cavities were distended with a transparent, feebly retracting, structureless, material, in which were numerous small irregularly shaped particles of higher refracting power. This material resembled, almost exactly, the normal secretion in appearance, and, like it, was free in the cavity of the vesicles. In these vesicles there was very little trace of epithelium, only some small, and few, non-nucleated corpuscles ; but in other vesicles the epithelium was so abundant, that it completely occupied the cavity. It was in no respect different, except as to quantity, from its healthy condition, con- sisting of mere nuclei and interposed granular matter in no great abundance. In some of the vesicles there were large and beautiful crystals of more or less perfect octohedral form. These were either oxalate of lime or triple phosphate. One prodigiously enlarged vesi- cle contained a mass of calcareous matter, very firm and dense throughout, but most in its central and peripheral parts. In the latter situation there were numerous masses of ossi- form substance, of yellowish semi-transparent aspect. On crushing these, no bone lacunas could be discerned in the fragments. They dis- solved freely with strong effervescence in nitric acid, leaving an homogeneo-fibrous basis substance, which often exhibited a greenish yellow tint. The material, thus proved to be of cretaceous nature, contained, mingled with it, numerous tablets of cholesterine. One small reddish mass, occupying the cavity of a vesicle, was found to consist almost wholly of blood globules and their detritus, and thus seemed to be the result of hemorrhage. Another opaque whitish mass did not effervesce with nitric acid, and was therefore not cretaceous; it consisted of epithelial nuclei mingled with peculiar, and rather abundant, granular matter. In the above account it is worth noticing that no cells were found ; the epithelium retained its natural appearance ; also the matter distend- ing the greater number of the cavities resem- bled exactly, so far as the eye could judge, the natural secretion ; and lastly, that in some in- stances there was an accumulation of unaltered epithelium and not of the secretion. This last fact is of some importance with respect to the exact nature of the function discharged by the epithelium. Owing to the kindness of my friend, Mr. H. Gray, 1 have recently had the opportunity of examining a remarkable specimen of Braii- chocele. The gland was greatly enlarged,—.to five or six times its natural magnitude,— and altered in form, one lateral lobe being raised up higher than the other, and the surface being somewhat uneven and nodulated. On a section being made, the exposed surface presented a reddish glossy aspect, somewhat resembling that of certain forms of malignant disease which are undergoing softening: there was no appearance of distended cavities ; in fact, the structure to the eye exhibited less of the cellular arrangement than is usual. Micro- scopic examination confirmed the impression derived from simple inspection. — But little of the natural secreting structure remained, the vesicles being destroyed, and their secretion, though still present in some quantity, being certainly diminished. Some traces of the epithelium of the cavities were perceptible; but there was no special cell growth indicative of any adventitious formation ; a few large cells or globules only, varying in srze from to T7n,-o in- diameter, existed in some of the remaining cavities : these evidently consisted of aggregations of oily molecules and drops not manifestly enclosed by any en- velope. The blood-vessels were prodigiously and universally enlarged; some of those which were capillaries in structure were from two to three times their normal diameter, and irre- gularly dilated and varicose; they were every where clustered over with minute oil drops ; which formed so thick a coating to many of them, that they appeared as white cylinders by direct light. Some parts of the gland pre- sented to the naked eye a whiter aspect than others ; and in them it was seen that the de- posit of oily matter along the vessels, and the destruction of the glandular tissue, had pro- ceeded to the greatest extent. In some places there were masses of ossiform deposit. The morbid alteration now described ap- proaches most nearly, I think, to the vascular and aneurismatic bronchocele ; but the exten- sive destruction of the glandular tissue, and the copious deposit of oily matter, show that there must have been some grave derangement of the nutrition of the gland. The case oc- curred in a female (tet. 75.), who died withTHYROID GLAND. 1116 cirrhosis of the liver and ascites ; the kidneys contained numerous small cysts, and there were two fibrinous blocks in the spleen. Adventitious formations. — Cystic formation within the thyroid is next described by Pro- fessor Hasse; and regarding it as depending on the development of new cysts within the gland, and not on the perverted or ex- cessive action of its own natural vesicular cavities, it will fall under our third head. I am, however, rather in doubt whether most cases of cystic formation in the thy- roid do not belong to the second category, and are not dependent on the development of any adventitious structure. Prof. Hasse says, " cystic formation within the thyroid gland is one of the most frequent causes of "oitre. It occurs both by itself, and in con- junction with other kinds of degeneration, and constitutes the largest and most unsightly of all tumours. Cysts of every variety and size, either solitary or in congeries, are en- countered in every part of the thyroid gland; an entire lobe, nay, the greater portion of the whole organ, being sometimes engaged in cystic development. The surrounding tex- ture is seldom healthy, being generally com- pressed, flabby, and bloodless. The cysts are, for the most part, isolated. Occasionally, how- ever, they abut one upon another, so as to form a single multilocular capsule. Here, as elsewhere, they are composed of two mem- branes ; namely, an external filamentous, and an inner serous, one. The external membrane is either smooth, or sends forth bands which attach it closely to the rest of the texture; in many instances it partially, if not wholly, ossifies. The sac contains a limpid fluid, or a number of secondary hydatids *, or, again, a jelly-like substance, but more commonly a yellowish or whitish crystalline pulp, consist- ing almost wholly of cholesterine crystals with phosphate and carbonate of lime. In some instances the cyst accidentally inflames and becomes atrophied; in others it gradually fills with earthy matter, and is transformed into a hard calcareous nodule. Cysts occur in the thyroid gland, in both sexes, and nearly at all ages; more frequently, however, in females after the prime of life." A remarkable case of cystic formation in the thyroid is mentioned byAndral. He states that the whole organ was converted into a cyst with bony walls filled with a honey-like fluid. He seems to recognise both the cystic and melicerous degeneration as further stages of the per- verted or excessive action which occurs in simple hypertrophy, and justly refers to the case of the ovary as exactly analogous, the cysts of which, filled with various products, originate, in all probability, in Graafian vesicles, which undergo an abnormal development. Prof. Hasse has never met with tubercles occurring in the thyroid. Prof. Louis makes no mention of such an occurrence, nor does M. Papavoine in a table which he gives of * Lieutaud mentions a case where the trachea was perforated by one of these acephalo-cysts. the seat of tubercle in various degrees, drawn up from the examination of the bodies of fifty children. Sauten has observed that persons affected with extensive bronchocele seldom or never become subjects of phthisis. Carcinomatous growths rarely affect the thy- roid. Eight cases in 8289 of deaths occur- ring from cancer in Paris, are ascribed to this part. * The disease is sometimes primary, sometimes secondary, or the result of invasion from some neighbouring affected part. Encephaloid or scirrhus in several of their varieties have been known to occur in the organ, but no example of colloid in it has yet been detected : of course cysts filled with melicerous contents must not be confounded with the loculi of real colloid, to which they bear some resemblance. Primary cancer in the thyroid usually exhibits the characters of scirrhus, secondary those of encephaloid: in the first case the disease is usually infiltrated, in the second of the tuberous form. Ence- phaloid here, as elsewhere, often grows rapidly, and attains a large size. It seems to ob- literate entirely the natural appearance of the gland. It is often of the hcematoid variety, in which there is sometimes softening in the centre of the mass, causing rupture of vessels and extravasation of blood. Occasionally black pigment is accumulated within its texture in varying amount, " Medullary cancer of this gland must not be confounded with that of the lymphatic glands of the neck, which often simulates goitre." Enlargement of the Vessels. — The last kind of morbid degeneration, which the thy- roid has been observed to undergo, is that to which the term vascular or aneurismatic bronchocele has been applied. It is de- scribed as follows by Professor Hasse,—" All the blood vessels are much amplified, the veins in particular forming very dense, capacious, often knotted, plexuses, and the whole texture consisting apparently of adense coil of vessels. The substance of the gland has almost en- tirely lost its granular character ; it is flabby and dark red. After death the tumour col- lapses considerably, and can only be restored to its original size by artificial injection. The walls of the arteries and veins are attenuated, the dilated membranes of the vessels contain considerable clots, and capacious cavities are found filled with black coagulated blood. Vasculai\bronchocele affects the entire gland; principally, however, one or other lobe. It occurs most frequently in females after the prime of life, and is, like simple hypertrophy, marked by periodical augmentation and de- crease. This general dilatation of blood-vessels must not be confounded with the exuberant vascular (malignant) growth termed fungus hasmatodes, to which the thyroid gland is also subject." In the foregoing description we have clearly set forth the condition of an organ, the walls of whose vessels have, from loss of their natural tonicity, yielded to the * Walshe on cancer.THYROID GLAND. 1117 impetus of the current of blood, and being thus enlarged and distended, have pressed upon the essential structure of the gland, and caused it to become atrophied. It may not be amiss to observe, after this review, that the disease of the thyroid, which is of by far the most frequent occurrence, viz. enlargement of its magnitude from excessive or perverted secretory action, is just of the kind we should, from our knowledge of its actual structure, expect would be most liable to occur. For when once the nicely arranged balance of secretion and absorption, with its moderate alternating oscillations in either direction, is permanently deranged, the closed cavities of the glandular vesicles afford no exit to the accumulating matters. Thus does minute anatomy explain, and thus is it con- firmed by, the changes wrought by disease. History of Investigations. — The fol- lowing is not presented as a complete history of the thyroid, but as a sketch which it is hoped contains the principal facts relative to the advance of our knowledge respecting it. In examining the works of Aristotle, I find he makes no mention of the thyroid in two places, where he describes the organs situated in the neck, and speaks especially of the trachea. Galen does not give any very dis- tinct account of the thyroid, so far as I have been able to discover; but certainly seems to allude to it in a passage in his book " On the Use of the Parts of the Human Body," where he speaks of the glands of the larynx, " which are always found more loose and spongy than others, and which, by the common consent of anatomists have been created for the purpose of moistening and bathing all the parts of the larynx and the passage of the throat." The following passage, quoted also in a note by Morgagni *, seems to prove that he was aware of the main peculiarity of the thyroid. " Now the neck has two glands, in which a moisture is generated. But from the two glands which are in the neck there come forth no vessels by which the moisture may flow out, as those do from the glands of the tongue." Vesalius, who wrote about a.d. 15-12, dis- tinctly recognises the existence of the thyroid in the following passage from his work, " De corporis humani fabrica." f "And thisdissec- tion also shows two glands, adhering one on each side, to the root of the larynx, which are of large size, and very fungous, and nearly of the colour of flesh, but darker, and covered over with very conspicuous vessels." In the second book he describes their appearance in oxen, in whom they resemble muscular tissue, he says, very much, while in man their aspect is more truly glandular. Jacobus Sylvius, who wrote a little later than Vesalius, enumerates, in his list of glands, " duae item ad laryngis radicem asperseque arterise initium utrinque una qua; interdum ob magnitudinem in unam abire videntur." Wharton, in his Adenographia, published about I606, gives a very full and good description of the thyroid ; he notices * Advers. Anat. i. c. 20. f Lib. vi. cap. 4. its situation, figure, magnitude, texture (sub- stantial!)), and consistence (soliditatem) ; and remarks " that it is much more full of blood than any other gland, also more viscid and solid, and more resembling muscular flesh. This is the only difference, that it is not of a fibrous structure, but rather of a glutinous nature." He assigns four uses to the gland, which it may be worth while to quote, as affording an example of the speculations then in vogue, the last perhaps being not the least real and important of those he mentions! "(1) The first and principal use of these glands appears to be to take up certain superfluous moistures from the recurrent nerve, and to bring them back again into the vascular system by their own lymph channels. (2) To cherish the cartilages to which it is fixed, which are rather of a chilly nature, by its own heat ; for it is copiously supplied with arteries, and abounds with blood, from whence it may conveniently impart heat to the neighbouring parts. (3) To conduce by its exhalations to the lubri- cation of the larynx, and so to render the voice smoother, more melodious, and sweeter. (4) To contribute much to the rounded con- tour and beauty of the neck; for they fill up the empty spaces about the larynx, and make its protuberant parts almost to subside and become smooth, especially in the female sex, to whom on this account a larger gland has been assigned, which renders their necks more even and beautiful." Verheyen, writing about 1720, describes the thyroid as deriving its name from the cartilage so called, and states that it is con- sidered by some as double, i.e. consisting of two glands. He says, " this gland, beyond doubt, serves also to moisten the neighbour- ing parts ; but, because it is very large, there is an apparent reason why it should have rather large excretory ducts, or one at least very conspicuous, which yet hitherto has not been discovered." About 1708, Evertzen wrote an inaugural dissertation on the thyroid gland, noticing its structure, some diseases to which it is liable, and their treatment. Morgagni, in his Advers. Anat. (1723) dis- cusses two questions respecting the thyroid; one as to whether the gland is double or single, i. e. whether the lobes are connected by an isthmus or not ; this he decides, as re- spects man, positively in the affirmative. The other vexata questio, as to whether the thyroid be provided with a duct or not, he confesses to be yet undetermined. He notices the ex- istence of vesicular cavities in enlarged thy- roids, which he justly supposes to be the natural cavities (nativi acini) dilated by their accumulated secretion. From his examina- tion of the secretion of the thyroid, " molleni quendam, et obliniendo lubricandoque ido- neum, succum communi isti amygdalarum oleo longe consimilem ;" and from observing the thyroid to be exposed to the pressure of contracting muscles, as is the case with some other undoubted glands, he inclines to con- sider it probable that the gland has some duct1118 THYROID GLAND. opening into the pharynx, the oesophagus, or into the top of the trachea. Santorini (Observ. Anat. 1754), recognizes the thyroid as a single gland, and makes men- tion of its median column as previously known to Morgagni, though it was probably dis- covered by Bidloo or Lalonette. He details the failure of his efforts to discover a duct, though he had several times detected an orifice at the anterior angle of the glottis, into which a brittle could be passed ; and yet re- marks that the thyroid gland may be urged to expel its secretion by the pressure of the sub-hyoidean muscles, the throbbings of the carotids, and the contractions of the oeso- phagus. Haller (Element. Physiolog. 1766), in his account of the thyroid, gives a good descrip- tion of the median column, and of the several varieties which it presents ; four times only has he found it absent; most frequently existing on the left side ; sometimes, however, on the right. He relates some experiments of Lalonette, in which it appeared as if the glandular cavities had been distended by inflation with air, and also the lymphatic -vessels proceeding from them. The result of this coarse proceeding he explains, and probably cor- rectly, by supposing that the distended cavities were those of the areolar texture, and not the secreting vesicles. He remarks that, even according to Lalonette's testimony, no secre- tion can ever be pressed out of the thyroid gland into the cavity of the larynx ; or if* any appear it seems to be nothing more than the contents of some mucous follicles. After detailing the struggles and efforts of various anatomists to discover an efferent duct, he states at last that several inquirers, among whom he mentions Ruysch in particular, had adopted the only possible remaining opinion, that a peculiar fluid was elaborated in the gland, which being received into the radicles of the veins, was returned into the blood. This view, which laborious, and thoughtful, and sagacious men were then slow to entertain, is now universally adopted ; and it seems cer- tainly a matte- of wonder that it was not sooner arrived at. May we not, however, question whether, in regard to other glands, a process somewhat similar does not also occur, —whether certain complementary products of secretory action are not formed in the gland, and afterwards absorbed and carried off by venous and lymphatic radicles ? Meckel's description of the thyroid is as complete as could be accomplished by the most consummate anatomical skill, while un- aided by the achromatic lens. I need not refer to his well known pages, further than to notice a suggestion which he offers, viz., that as the median column is much more deve- loped in the infant than in the adult, the excretory duct may exist at that period (in the median column), and become obliterated as age advances. In proceeding beyond this period, we come to the anatomists of our own day ; several of whom have advanced our knowledge con- siderably respecting the thyroid and other ductless glands. To none, however, are we more indebted than to Mr. Simon; whose mfcsterly and philosophical Essay on the Thymus contains the best account of the anatomy and physiology of these organs that has yet been given.

TIBIOFIBULAR ARTICULATIONS. — The bones of the leg, throughout the greater part of their length parallel and con- tiguous to each other only, are in contact by their extremities. At the points of contact the two tibio-fibular articulations, a superior and an inferior, are situated. Superior Tibio-Fibular Articulation. —The head of the fibula is in contact with the external tuberosity of the tibia. The for- mer is furnished with an articulating surface which has an aspect upwards, forwards, and in- wards, whilst the articular facet on the latter is placed rather towards the posterior part of the tuberosity of the tibia, and is directed downwards, backwards, and outwards. Both surfaces are almost perfectly plane, their form is circular, and they are encrusted with arti- cular cartilage ; hence this articulation is to be referred to the class arthrodia. a. The ligaments of this joint are two in number, named, from their relative positions, anterior and posterior ligaments. 1. The anterior ligament of the superior tibio-fibular articulation, is composed of a fas- ciculus of white fibrous bands, which are all parallel to each other. It passes from the tibia downwards and outwards to the head of the fibula, running in front of the synovial membrane of the articulation which it defends. The extensor digitorum communis muscle covers this ligament anteriorly. 2. The posterior ligament follows a similar direction on the posterior aspect of the joint; but the fibres which compose it are neither so numerous nor so strong as those of the pre- ceding; this ligament is covered posteriorly by the poplitacus muscle. Lastly, the tendon of the biceps (flexor cruris), by its attachment to the head of the fibula, contributes, in no inconsiderable de- gree, to the security of the articulation. b. Synovial membrane.—There is nothing, in the anatomical disposition of the synovial membrane of this articulation, which requires any particular notice ; but the surgeon should remember that it is always in close proximity to the serous sac of the knee joint, and that in many instances the two synovial membranes communicate with each other. The synovialTIBIOFIBULAR ARTICULATIONS. 1119 membrane of the knee joint is brought into this close relationship with that of the tibio- fibular articulation, by means of a prolonga- tion which passes downwards from the former around the tendon of the poplitoeus muscle ; and when a communication does exist between the two articulations, it will therefore be found at the posterior aspect of the head of the fibula. This anatomical arrangement has an import- ant bearing on a disputed point of practice, viz. the extirpation of the head of the fibula in amputations of the leg near the knee joint. This proceeding, recommended originally by Larrcy and Garriques, and subsequently re- vived by Mr. Guthrie, has been opposed by Mr. Adams of Dublin, who, appealing to the anatomical peculiarities just described, makes them the grounds for rejecting altogether the innovation in question. (Vide "Abnormal Condition of the Knee Joint," vol. iii. p. 50.) Inferior Tibio-Fibular Articulation. —This articulation is intimately connected with that of the ankle, from which, although anatomically distinct, it cannot virtually be separated. The tibia and the fibula, at the lower part of the leg, are closely connected for a consider- able portion of their extent. The tibia pre- sents, on its external aspect and interiorly, a triangular-shaped surface, two inches in verti- cal height, and concave from side to side : superiorly, or towards the apex of this space, it presents a rough and scabrous surface ; but inferiorty it is smooth and encrusted, in the recent state, with articular cartilage. The inner surface of the lower end of the fibula is of similar shape, but convex ; it is rough su- periorly, anil smooth interiorly. Here the two bones form an arthrodial articulation. a. The cartilage, which in this situation in- vests the opposed surfaces of the tibia and fibula, is continuous with that which covers the inferior surface of the tibia. It is also lined by—b.—synovial membrane prolonged upwards from the ankle joint, and which forms a small cul-de-sac in the tibio-fibular articulation. The rough irregular surfaces, on the bones above the line of reflexion of the synovial membrane, have the fibres of a strong inter- osseous ligament implanted into them. c. The ligaments of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation are three in number ; 1. an ante- rior, 2. a posterior, and 3. an interosseous. 1, Anterior tibio-fibular ligament.—The fibres of this ligament pursue a direction downwards and outwards, from the anterior margin of the small articulating surface on the tibia to the outer malleolus ; and as the lower margin of this ligament projects below the level of the tibia, it deepens somewhat the cavity for the reception of the astragalus. The tendon of the peronaeus tertius muscle covers this liga- ment in front. 2. Posterior tibio-fibular ligament.—This is a strong, round, fibro-cartilaginous cord, w hich passes from one malleolus to the other in an arched manner, having a concavity directed downwards, and connected with the posterior ligament of the ankle joint, and a convexity which adheres uniformly to the posterior arti- cular margins of the tibia and fibula. This ligament not only connects the two bones to each other, but it also, like circumferential fibro-cartilages elsewhere, serves the purpose of deepening the mortice-shaped cavity of the ankle joint which it borders. It likewise pre- vents the immediate contact of the osseous surfaces in forced extension of the foot, being interposed between the bones as an elastic cushion. 3. Interosseous tibio-fibular ligament.—This is composed of short transverse bands firmly implanted, at right angles, into the opposed rough surfaces on the bones already described. Superiorly, the fibres of this ligament extend nearly as far as the lower margin of the inter- osseous membrane, (separated from it by a small interval, through which passes a branch of the fibular artery), whilst inferiorly they are limited by the direct contact of the two bones of the leg, which they serve to bind firmly together. In order to exhibit this structure, either of two methods may be adopted ; the bones of the leg may be sawn across about their centres, and then forcibly torn asunder, (in this way the ligament may be seen, and its powers of resistance appreciated), or the ligament may be exhibited in situ, by making a vertical, transverse, section of both bones, traversing the two malleoli, and also the joint of the ankle.* Mechanism of the tibio-fibular articulations. —The movements of the fibula on the tibia are extremely limited ; this is in accordance with the general plan on which the skeleton of the lower extremity is formed, its use being to serve as an organ of support, and of locomo- tion, only. The bones of the leg are connected together by the intervention of ligaments, (not consolidated together as in the arrangement met with in a few of the Mammalia), and thus a greater degree of elasticity is obtained without any sacrifice of strength ; and it may be pre- sumed that the slight degree of yielding and of gliding motion, which is permitted in the tibio- fibular articulations, may occasionally serve to diffuse, and to lessen the intensity of shocks applied to the lower extremity, and may thus diminish its liability to injury, especially to fracture. Dislocation of the fibula, at the upper tibio-fibular articulation, has occasionally, but rarely, been met with as the result of injury. Sir A. Cooper mentions a case of compound fracture of the tibia, where this complication was observed ; but the rarity of dislocations in this situation, is accounted for by the cir- cumstance, that the fibula, owing to its com- parative slightness, almost invariably breaks, on the application of a force far short of what suffices to rupture its ligamentous connections with the tibia. The mechanism of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation is inseparably connected with * See fig. 61. p. 163. vol. i.1120 TONGUE. that of the neighbouring articulation of the ankle. In fact, on the perfect adaptation of the bones of the leg, at their lower extremities, essentially depends the integrity of the ankle joint itself. By the union of the tibia with the fibula the "mortice shaped" cavity, which receives the pulley of the astragalus, is formed, and any injuries which disturb the natural rela- tions of these two bones interfere propor- tionally with the functions of the ankle, which is a perfect angular ginglymus. Hence it is, that in some cases of fracture of the lower end of the fibula, a widening of the mortice is produced, from which more or less of permanent deformity and inconve- nience results, abnormal lateral motion being then permitted. The connecting media be- tween the tibia and the fibula interiorly are of extreme strength ; so much so, that noordinary violence seems capable of rupturing them ; the bones being bound together, not only by the special ligaments of the inferior tibio-fibular articulation already described, but by the annular ligaments and fascia; of the leg also. Hence, as we might infer, the separation of these bones by injury has never been observed, except when the fibula has first been broken. In the "complete dislocation of the Toot up- wards and outwards, we are furnished with an illustration of the immense strength of the interosseous ligament ; as it is found that even in this severe injury the fibres of this ligament are not usually torn ; but the rough surface of the tibia into which they are implanted is broken off, and carried upwards and outwards with the lower end of the fibula, to which the interosseous ligament still binds it." (See b. fig. 54. vol. i. page 157 ; article " Abnormal Conditions of the Ankle Joint.") {Ben. George M'Bowel.) TONGUE. (rXwcwrr, Gr.; Lingua, Lat. ; la Langue, Fr. ; Zunge, Germ. ; Lingua, Ital.) The tongue is a symmetrical muscular organ, situated in the middle line, at the ori- fice of the gastric portion of the gastro- pulmonary mucous membrane, invested with the mucous surface, and subserving to the earlv stages of the process of digestion. Human Anatomy.—The human tongue (in common with that of all mammalia) consists of, first, an osseous basis, itself movable, to which it is attached, and with which and on which it moves ; secondly, a muscular system, in part extrinsic, serving to attach it to certain fixed points and to move it on them, and in part intrinsic, constituting the bulk of its substance and moving it on it- self; thirdly, a mucous investment, variously modified in different parts ; fourthly, a pro- per system of mucous glands ; fifthly, a small quantity of fibrous and areolar tissue ; sixthly, a still smaller quantity of fat; seventhly, a large vascular supply ; and eighthly, an abun- dant distribution of nerves from three separate sources. Size. — The size of the tongue is very va- rious. I have examined some tongues of adults that certainly were not more than half the size of others, and there does not seem to be any relation between the size of the tongue and that of the individual; but between it and the size of the alveolar arch there is a close relation, and hence we see it generally much smaller in women than in men. It has been generally stated that certain obscurities in speech are caused by too large a tongue, but there do not seem to be any well authen- ticated cases to prove that this supposition is correct. It may in some degree be explained by the fact, that paralysis, which would cause a thickness of speech, would also cause a flaccid half-protruded condition, and, there- fore, an apparent increase of size, of the tongue. Direction. — In its anterior half it follows pretty much the direction of the lower jaw, that is, it tends forwards and a little down- wards, but behind this it curves downwards and backwards, and ere it reaches the os hyoides has become quite vertical, so that the average of its direction would be downwards and backwards, and its posterior extremity much lower than its anterior. Shape. —The tongue is of an ovoidal shape, the broad part being behind ; and the character of the curvature in front is parabolic, coin- ciding with the parabolic curve of the lower jaw : it possesses an exact lateral symmetry, and is flattened from above downwards, being thickest towards its base, and thinnest in front. When taken out of the body it seems to be flat, and in the same plane longitudin- ally, but when in situ it possesses a double curvature; one longitudinal, the most consi- derable, by which the upper surface is rendered convex, and by which the posterior part of the tongue is bent from a horizontal to a ver- tical direction ; the other, less considerable, affects the tongue transversely, and renders its posterior part concave in that direction : it is much increased by the contraction of the genioglossi, which draw the centre of the tongue down, or by that of the styloglossi, which draw its sides up. The longitudinal curvature, too, is very much affected by the position of the tongue, for when it is thrust forward, and the hyoid bone raised, the whole organ is much more horizontal, and the cur- vature almost effaced. General description. — In consequence of its possessing a long axis, and being vertically flattened, the tongue presents for description a superior and inferior surface, two lateral borders, arid an anterior and posterior extremity. The superior surface, borders, anterior ex- tremity, ami anterior third of the inferior sur- face are free; the posterior extremity and posterior two thirds of the inferior surface are attached. Along the line where the free and attached surfaces meet, we see the investing membrane leaving the tongue, and passing off to neighbouring structures, investing the loose areolar tissue by which in these situations it is underlaid, and forming a system of yielding and movable attachments. Thus at the base the mucous membrane passes off to the an-TONGUE. 1121 terior surface of the epiglottis, the sides of the pharynx, and upwards to the soft palate and posterior parts of the cheeks. As we proceed forwards we find it investing the sides, and gradually more and more of the under surface, reflected thence over the hyoglossi and ge- nioglossi muscles, the sublingual glands, vessels, and nerves, and much areolar tissue, which separate it from the mylohyoid muscle, to the inner surface of the alveoli of the lower jaw, where it becomes continuous with the mucous membrane covering the gums. At certain points where this membrane leaves the tongue it forms distinct folds, which, from their being constant, have received par- ticular names, and which act to a certain ex- tent as ligaments or frcna of the tongue, not so much by virtue of their being folds of mucous membrane, as from their containing within their reduplications a certain amount of a more or less unyielding tissue ; in some this tissue is a mixture of white and yellow fibre, in others it is muscle. Of the first sort are three folds, a middle and two lateral, passing from the base of the tongue to the epiglottis, called the glosso- epiglottid folds, of which the central, which is always present, and has been called the pos- terior frcenum of the tongue, and frcenum epi- glottitis, is much the most considerable (fig. 745. d.) : they serve rather to check the move- ments of the epiglottis than as lingual liga- ments. From the sides of the base of the tongue, passing thence to the soft palate, are seen four more folds, two on each side, which, from their position, have been called the pillars of the fauces. They are formed by the raising of the mucous membrane from the general surface by two muscles: the posterior, the least considerable, by the palato-pharyn- geus; the anterior, more marked, by the palatoglossus. The interval between these two is called the amygdaloid fossa, from its being occupied by the amygdalae, or tonsils : the anterior pair taken together constitute the constrictor of the fauces, and the narrowing caused by the whole apparatus has received the name of the isthmus faucium. From the basis of these folds being muscular their pro- minence is liable to constant variety. But the most considerable of these folds, which is called,par excellence, the frcenum of the tongue (frcenum, frenulum Ungues), is placed beneath the anterior free extremity, which it connects with the lower jaw. It consists of a prolonga- tion forwards, beyond the free border of the genioglossi, of the median fibrous lamina, which raises into a prominent fold the mucous membrane passing from the under surface of the anterior part of the tongue to the neigh- bouring alveoli of the lower jaw: it forms a strong ligament, and limits the backward movement of the anterior extremity of the tongue. Sometimes an extreme shortness of this ligament is a congenital malformation, preventing the free movement of the organ, and so impairing speech, mastication, &c, as to necessitate the operation known as cutting the tongue. VOL. IV. Before entering into the specialities of the anatomy of the tongue, let us examine its Fig. 745. 'I Human tongue viewed on the upper surface or dorsum. (After Scemmering.") general configuration and external characters, taking its surfaces, extremities, &c, in the order above enunciated. Superior surface.— On regarding the upper surface of the tongue, we see first that it is divided into two symmetrical portions by a median longitudinal furrow (Jig. 745. <?.), com- mencing at the tip, and extending back about two thirds the length of the organ. It is superficial when present, but in many cases does not exist : it is the representative, in this part, of that median line which symmetrically divides all those organs of animal life that are situated in the middle vertical plane. It is very generally, but very incorrectly, stated* that this furrow terminates posteriorly in the foramen caecum. The two have no relation ; the one often exists without the other ; and in every case that I have seen, the foramen has been separated from the posterior ter- mination of the furrow by the ridge of the circumvallate papillae, sometimes by a long interval. This median furrow seems partly formed by the action of muscles, and partly by a deficiency of papillae. Another con- spicuous character of the upper surface is, that the roughnesses with which it is covered are arranged in lines (fig. 745.), with a direction obliquely forwards and outwards, so * Bichat, Traite" d'Anatomie, t. ii. p. 594. 4 cTONGUE. 1122 that there is formed in the median line a series of angles pointing backwards. This disposition is seen to affect, more or less, all the structures with which the surface is covered. Thirdly, the upper surface of the tongue is seen to be divisible into a smooth and a rough portion. The smooth, or non- papillary portion, occupying nearly the pos- terior third,is characterised by smooth nodular rugosities {fig. 745. e), formed by small mu- ciparous glands, which are abundantly dis- tributed beneath the surface, and occupy the whole space between the papillae and epi- glottis : the}' are smallest and most scattered behind, where they are gradually lost ; larger and more prominent in front, where, from their being disposed in the direction already indicated, they form a prominent V-shaped ridge with the opening directed forwards. Just in front of this, separated by a groove, is another V-shaped ridge, more definite, but less constant in shape, formed by two con- verging lines of button-like eminences, each surrounded by a circular raised border of more or less regularity ; these compound organs are the circumvallate papillee (Jig. 745. ff). At the angle formed by the convergence of their two rows, generally a little behind that angle, is situated a cul-de-sac of very variable size, which has received the name of foramen ccccum (le trou borgne, lacune de la langue), and which was formerly regarded as the orifice at which several convergent sali- vary ducts terminated* ; these supposed sali- vary ducts were afterwards shown by Duver- noyf and HallerJ to be merely small veins. Meckel considered that this foramen caecum was nothing but a largely developed calyx of a caliciform papilla, of which the central portion was small, or wanting, or misplaced ; that if the central eminence was well de- veloped and in its proper situation, the foramen caecum was wanting, and that it only existed from some of the irregularities above mentioned; an opinion adopted by Cruveilhier, and by Professors Todd and Bowman in this country. Meckel states that he has seen two, one a great way behind the other. I have more than once met with the same appear- ance. In these cases the anterior one has always contained a well developed papilla. It can evidently perform no essential office, as it is so often wanting. The whole of the su- perior surface of the tongue, in front of the circumvallate papillae, comprising its anterior two thirds, is covered by an investment of coriaceous or filamentous asperities, longest in the central parts, and arranged with the most regularity at the back, where they are dis- tributed in lines of more or less distinctness, with a direction obliquely forwards and out- wards (Jig. 745. iz'.). These eminences are seen to be of two sorts ; one of a spheroidal shape, distinguished during life by their red * Coschwitz, De Ductu salivali novo. Hallo, 1724. f Loc. cit. i Exp. et Dub. circa Ductum Coscliw. Lej-den, 1727. colour, and scattered here and there at the posterior part, edges and tip, — these are the Jungiform papilla; (Jig. 745. h.) ; the others, occupying the whole of the rest of the sur- face, are the conical and Jiliform. To the minute consideration of these structures a future part of this article will be devoted. Inferior surface. — This surface is attached in its posterior two thirds by the muscles passing from it to the hyoid bone and lower jaw. The most posterior part of this attach- ment is as wide as the tongue itself, so that there no portion of the inferior surface is free ; but in front of this the attachment narrows, so that the lateral portions become increasingly free till they meet at the frsenum, in front of which they involve the whole surface. The longitudinal furrow is much more distinctly marked here than above, and is constant: it passes from the tip, on which it is continued, to the fraenum. On each side of the furrow the ranine veins are seen pass- ing forwards, and immediately beneath the tip is a little cluster of mucous glands first de- scribed by Nuck*, and also by Nuhn.f The mucous membrane here is quite smooth and free from any visible papillae. The edges of the tongue, which separate its upper and under surface, are thick behind and gradually become thinner in front; they are marked by a series of vertical ridges, separated by corresponding furrows, very dis- tinct on the upper, and gradually becoming lost as they approach the under, surface. They are very conspicuous at the posterior part, but disappear anteriorly, and they differ very much in their development in different subjects. They are, essentially, fused conical papillae. At the upper and posterior part of the edges are also a series of small mucous glands. The anterior extremity, apex, or point (Jig. 745. b.), is flattened or rounded, blunt or pointed, according to the movements of the tongue, and slightly impressed by the median furrow which is continued on it: it is not marked by any of those vertical ridges that characterise the edges. The posterior extremity, or base. — Ere the tongue reaches the os hyoides it becomes very flat and thin, and this from two causes — di- minution in the quantity of the intrinsic mus- cles, and the passing off of the extrinsic in other directions ; so that instead of being very thick, as is generally described, the base is in reality the thinnest part of the whole organ. It is flattened antero-posteriorly and much extended laterally, and by its attach- ment to the hyoid bone is curved in a horse- shoe shape, which, however, is much effaced by the insertion of the epiglottis in the area of the curvature. It is constituted laterally by the hyoglossi, centrally by the hyoglossal liga- ment, anteriorly by some fibres of the genio- glossus, and behind and above by the mu- cous membrane passing from it over the * Sialographia, Ductimm aquosorum anatome nova. Leyden, 1C90. f See Art. Salivary Glands, p. 426.TONGUE. 1123 epiglottis. It contains less muscular and more fibrous tissue than any other part of the tongue. Such, then, is a general description of the tongue, — such are the appearances that pre- sent themselves to the eye, on regarding its ex- ternal surface and configuration. Let us now examine these structures more minutely, and, to facilitate that examination, arrange the parts that contribute to the formation of the organ, according to the office they fulfil, or their absolute nature. Regarding the tongue in this light, we find that it may be considered as consisting of three systems,— 1. A bash, or system of support. 2. A muscular system, or system of move- ment. 3. A tegumentary investment, or system of sensation and protection. 1. Basis, or framework of the tongue.—This consists of the hyoid bone, the hyoglossal membrane or ligament, the median fibrous septum (the cartilaginous lamina of M. Blan- din), and, fourthly, to these may perhaps be added, on account of its density, and its giving attachment to most of the intrinsic muscles, the compact fibrous tissue, or cutis, beneath the mucous membrane. Fig. 746. Ili/oid bone. A. seen from above, and B. in profile. {Natural size). a. The hyoid bone (os hyoides,—upsiloi'des, —lingualis,— linguae), called also the lingual or tongue bone, has received its name from its resemblance to the Greek v ; it is the homo- logue in man of a very complex mechanism in the lower vertebrata, from which circum- stance it is sometimes called the hyoid ap- paratus. It consists of a bony arch, with a curvature nearly approaching a parabola, the convexity being in front; — situated in an almost horizontal position behind and rather below the lower jaw. In the lower ver- tebrata the hyoid bone is connected to the rest of the skeleton by bony media ; in man, by the substitution of a ligament (the stylo- hyoid) for a part of this osseous connection ; it is isolated, and disconnected from all the other bones.* It performs the triple office of a basis of the tongue, a point of support to the larynx, and a jwint d'appid or fulcrum, by which the contractions of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue and larynx may be impressed on those organs : it may also be looked upon as the first part of that framework (afterwards generally continued by cartilage) which secures the permanent patulence of the respiratory passages. It is retained in its place by muscles and ligaments, which, converging to it from different direc- tions, effectually prevent its displacement: thus it is tied upwards and backwards by the ligament and muscles from the styloid process, in front by the muscles from the chin and lower jaw, below by those from the thyroid cartilage, sternum, and scapula. Placed be- tween the tongue and larynx, it impresses on each the movement of the other, and is the medium by which the motions of these two organs are so intimately associated. Relations. — Its whole external surface is devoted to muscular insertions, which separate it, anteriorly and laterally, from the cutaneous structures. Behind, it is in relation with the epiglottis, from which it is separated by some dense cellular tissue, and by the thyrohyoid membrane, and with the mucous membrane of the pharynx. In man the hyoid bone consists of five pieces, — the basis or body, two greater cornua which project backwards from the sides of the body in a direction nearly horizontal but a little upwards, and two lesser cornua, sur- mounting the body and greater cornua at the point of their union. The body is quadrilateral, compressed an- tero-posteriorly, curved, and laterally ex- tended. Its anterior surface looks upwards, is convex,and intersected by two irregular ridges, a vertical and horizontal, which at the point of their union project in a prominent tubercle, which is the analogue in man of an additional element of the hyoid apparatus in the lower animals — the true lingual bone (glossoliyal) : this tubercle is sometimes bifurcated. The portion above the transverse ridge is directed much more upwards than that below, so that it has sometimes been called the upper sur- face : in that case the portion below is de- scribed as the whole anterior surface, a cir- cumstance which has led to much confusion with regard to the nomenclature of muscular insertions into this bone. The posterior surface is concave, and looks downwards ; it is marked by many little foramina entering the cancellous structure, and is sometimes covered by a syno- vial membrane. The lateral surfaces, small and articular, are connected to the anterior ex- tremities of the greater cornua by a lamina of temporal'}' cartilage, which,however, is seldom completely ossified, and which admits a certain amount of movement between the different * In some rare cases this ligament has been ossified, and then the condition of the os hyoides is the same as that found in most quadrupeds, fish, and reptiles.TONGUE. 1124 parts. The superior border presents a double curvature, something like the upper lip of the mouth, i. e., it curves downwards at its ex- tremities, and has a little dip in the middle. The inferior border, of less extent, is thinner, horizontal, and placed on a plane anterior to the upper. The greater cornua are at least half as long again as the body, from the sides of which they project, at first a little outwards and then backwards; they possess a shaft and two extremities. The anterior extremity is large, club-shaped, tuberculated, and curved in- wards towards the body, for its attachment with which it presents an articular facet ; the shaft tapers gradually posteriorly, and is la- terally flattened, so that it has an outer and inner surface, and an upper and lower border. Its outer surface, which is continuous with the anterior surface of the body, looks a little upwards ; its lower border is smooth and rounded; its upper border sharp, and, from the obliquity of the surfaces, of less extent than the lower. The posterior extremity is expanded into a little tubercle, sometimes sur- mounted by an epiphysis. The lesser cornua (ossa pisiformia lingualia, of Soemmering) are two little pyramidal or pisiform nodules, projecting upwards, out- wards, and backwards, from the point of union of the greater cornua and body : they are seldom completely ossified. They are the homologues in man of a very considerable process {the ceralohyal) in the lower animals, in some of whom the proportion between the lesser and greater cornua is inverted. Structure — Chiefly compact, but a little cancellous in the body and large extremity of the greater cornua. Development. — From five points ; one for each element. Vesalius saw a case in which there were six, there being two for the body. The ossification commences in the greater cornua ; it then takes place in the body, where it begins soon after birth ; and, finally, in the lesser cornua, where it does not com- mence till some months after. It proceeds but slowly, and generally leaves a thin lamina of cartilage unossified, so that complete an- chylosis of the different parts into one bone is comparatively rare. The morphological value of this bone and its homological relations, will be treated of hereafter. b. The hyoglossal membrane or ligament. — This is a vertical transverse lamina of very dense areolar tissue, containing a large pro- portion of the yellow element, passing up- wards from the upper border of the body of the os hyoides to the tongue, between which it constitutes a means of union. The mus- cular connection of the tongue with the hyoid bone by means of the hyoglossus is deficient in the central part of the body of that bone, and, consequently, this ligament is, in that situation, the only direct bond of connection. It is dense, yellow, and very elastic, and has a little fat dispersed among it, though this is denied by Bichat. It may be traced upwards into the tongue, sometimes as far as an inch. It receives on its anterior face those fibres of the genioglossus that lie immediately above those that are inserted into the hyoid bone, and also some of the intrinsic longitudinal fibres of the tongue that terminate upon it; posteriorly it is in relation with the upper part of the epiglottis and the mucous membrane reflected upon it from the tongue ; in fact, it immediately underlays the glosso-epiglottid folds. Above, it is gradually lost in the muscles of the tongue ; below, it in part terminates in the upper lip of the body of the os hyoides, and in part is continued on behind this bone, constituting the yellow elas- tic tissue already referred to as being inter- posed between it and the epiglottis. This ligament has been well described by Bichat.* c. Median fibrous septum {median carti- laginous lamina, Blandin). — Springing from the anterior surface of the last-mentioned structure, interposed between the two ge- nioglossi muscles, passing forwards between these two muscles as far as their genial origin, upwards to the dorsum of the tongue as far forwards as its centre, and thence to the anterior free border of the genioglossi, and a little beyond that border, is a vertical lamina of fibrous tissue. It is thick and dense behind and below, but gradually becomes thinned out as it spreads upwards and for- wards ; as it gets thinner it becomes cribriform, like the septum of the corpora cavernosa penis, the areolae giving transmission to the transverse muscles of the tongue, which pass through it from side to side. It varies much in different individuals; in some it is tolerably dense, in some it is merely a fine areolar web. This structure M. Blandin has dignified with the name of" median cartilaginous lamina" and has described it as consisting of a vertical sheet of that substance of more or less extent. I have, however, looked in vain for any thing like cartilage or fibro-cartilage in any part of it. It appears to me to be nothing more than intermuscular areolar tissue in rather greater amount and density than usual, which hap- pens to be placed in the median plane. It has been supposed by some to be the analogue of the small fusiform slip of cartilage placed beneath the extremity of the tongue in the dog and wolf, with which, however, it has no relation : that structure is essentially dis- tinct. Others have found in it the analogue of the lingual bone, a conception still more far-fetched. It has been supposed to give origin to muscular fibres by its two surfaces. This I have failed in detecting; certainly it does not give attachment to any of the trans- verse fibres of the tongue, to which it might be supposed it would, if to any; for they may be seen, by transverse sections viewed with the microscope, to pass, without excep- tion, from side to side of the tongue, without any break in their median plane. d. Lastly, the investments of the tongue, in- cluding the papillary structures and the true * Traitc d'Anatomic, t. ii. p. 596.1125 TONGUE. 4 c 3 cutis underlaying them, may be looked upon, in one light, as apart of the framework of the organ. They form a dense and unyielding envelope, tending to preserve its shape and give it firmness and support, and at the same time affording attachment to a great number of its muscular fibres. Such, then, is a concise description of the framework of the tongue. The first and last- mentioned elements of it are, doubtless, the most important; but it will be seen, at a future page, that the intrinsic arrangement of the tongue's muscular fibres is such that they mutually support each other, and tend to keep the organ firm and compact, which obviates the necessity of any considerable structures especially destined for that purpose. 2. The muscular system. — Constituting the chief bulk of the tongue, imparting the required consistence to it, performing the ma- jority of its functions — prehension, mastica- tion, deglutition, speech,— and necessary even to the perfection of taste, the muscular sys- tem of the tongue may be considered the most important of all. The muscles of the tongue are of three sorts, and admit of the following arrange- ment : a. Intrinsic. b. Extrinsic. c. Accessory. The intrinsic muscles are those which form the substance of the organ, that pass from part to part of it, and that move the tongue on itself. The extrinsic (prope)-) are those that, as well as entering in some degree into the sub- stance of the tongue, pass from it to neigh- bouring fixed points, to which they attach it, and on which they move it. The accessory are those which, though not contributing in any degree to the formation of the tongue, nor attached to it, are yet engaged in all its extrinsic movements, acting as coadjutors to those proper extrinsic mus- cles whose direction coincides with theirs. Of the two first I shall speak particularly : little more than their enumeration will suffice for the last. a. Intrinsic muscles of the tongue. — There are three methods of investigating the arrange- ment of the tongue's intrinsic muscular struc- ture : first, by the ordinary method of dissec- tion, or separation; secondly, by making sections in different planes, and examining the appearance of the cut surfaces ; thirdly, by the microscopic examination of thin sec- tions. The first, which is the oldest, is that by which we gain the least information ; and to its adoption must be attributed the fact that so many of the older anatomists were in the dark on this subject. By it we merely learn the following facts : that certain of the ex- trinsic muscles pass into the substance of the tongue and contribute to certain of the intrinsic ; that the direction of most of the superficial fibres is more or less longitu- dinal ; that the direction of the more deep- seated fibres is not longitudinal; that it is complex, and incapable of demonstration by separation. The second method furnishes much more certain information. By making the sections in different planes, we vary the point from which we regard them ; and the section made in one plane corrects, and supplies the defi- ciencies of, the other. The transverse vertical section is the most important; and to this I shall chiefly refer. On making a transverse vertical section of a human tongue, at a point just behind the ante- rior free margin of the genioglossus {Jig. 74-7.), the following are the appearances. Imme- diately within the cutis, which is seen to be to- lerably thick, especially at the centre of the dor- sum (Jig. 747. a.), is seen a dark red stratum, Fig. 747. Transverse vertical section of human tongue just behind the free portion, a, upper surface, showing the thickness of the cutis there ; b, cortical portion ; c, central portion, where the vertical fibres are seen crossing the transverse; d, genioglossi muscles; e e, sub- lingual glands. also thick in the last-mentioned situation, thinner at the lateral regions, and again thicker as it curves inwards on each side of the in- ferior surface. This is very dense, and cuts with a perfectly even surface. I shall call it the cortical portion (fig. 747. b.). Within this and surrounded by it as by a border, is an area of a more or less oval form, of a paler colour, less dense, and showing a distinctly fibrous character. The fibres appear for the most part transverse (Jig. 747. c), horizontal in the centre, but curved up a little on each side. They are bounded on all sides by the cortical portion. Entering the centre of the bottom of the section, passing vertically up- wards, crossing the last-mentioned fibres at right angles, and terminating in the superior surface of the cortical portion, are seen the two genioglossi muscles (fig. 747. d.). These, therefore, constitute a vertical set of fibres ; but they are not the only vertical fibres; at each side of them, especially at the inferior portion of the section, other vertical fibres are seen passing upwards and a little inwards, and intersecting the more lateral portions ofTONGUE. 1126 and has the advantage of brevity. * Bichat, Traite' d'Anatomie, t. ii. p. 43. the transverse at right angles.* Cruveilhier has erroneously described them as passing downwards and inwards: their divergence as they pass downwards is very conspicuous. The central area— the lingual nucleus (noyau lingual) of Bauer, — is therefore constituted of two sets of fibres, a ventrical and trans- verse ; the transverse being entirely intrinsic, and the vertical in part intrinsic and in part derived from the genioglossus. A section made anterior to the free margin of this last-mentioned muscle, shows the cor- tical portion continued completely round the tongue, without the break on its inferior sur- face, occasioned, in the previous section, by the entrance of the genioglossi muscles; it is also of greater thickness in proportion to the central part, which is comparatively small, and the transverse fibres have a less marked upward curvature at their extremities. Thirdly, a section made near the base of the tongue shows the cortical portion nearly lost at the upper surface, greatly accumulated at the sides, but not of so compact a nature as in more anterior situations; the obliquely ver- tical fibres tolerably abundant, but the trans- verse nearly lost, and the greater part of the inferior surface occupied by the expanded genioglossi. Transverse vertical sections, therefore, dis- play two sets of fibres, a vertical and a trans- verse, and shew their situation and quantity; let us now see what additional light will be fur- nished by a longitudinal vertical section. It shews that the cortical portion consists of lon- gitudinal fibres, and thus supplies a third set. If the section be made in the middle line, or near it, the whole cut surface is occupied by the vertical fibres of the geniohyoglossus, at first directed backwards, but curving upwards so as to enter the tongue vertically, in which vertical direction they are continued up through its entire thickness, and are lost in the longi- tudinal fibres of the cortical portion ; if the section is made in the lateral portions, it shows the vertical striation occasioned hy the in- trinsic vertical fibres, and the cortical portion, as in the other. Having ascertained the si- tuation and direction of the three sorts of fibres, we may, by making transverse sections at all points from the apex to the base, and longitudinal ones at various distances from the vertical median plane, and also by tracing the extrinsic longitudinal muscles into the intrinsic, and seeing what part of the one the other fur- nishes, get an exact interpretation of them. We should then find the tongue to consist of the following muscles. «. A transverse lingual^, altogether intrinsic, * Thcile denies the existence of the intrinsic vertical fibres; he says that those seen in longi- tudinal section are the ascending fibres of the genio- glossus, and those seen besides them in trans- verse sections are the most oblique of the transverse; — a misconception of which the microscopical ex- amination of sections at once shows the fallacy. t The adoption of the word lingual for all the intrinsic muscles of the tongue, from the French writers on this subject, has no objection against it, inserted on each side into the submucous fibrous tissue or cutis, continued from apex to base, more abundant anteriorly, where it is horizontal, becoming more curved upwards as we proceed backwards, and being lost at the base. 13. A vertical lingual, in part intrinsic ; in part the lingual portion of an extrinsic muscle, the genioglossus, existing from apex to base, in all parts vertical to the surface, and there- fore, from the curved direction of the tongue, arranged in a more or less radiating or fan- like manner. 7. A superior lingual, longitudinal, in- trinsic, thin behind, thicker in the middle, and thinner again at the apex, arising from the hyoglossal membrane and cutis at the base of the tongue in a gradual way, and having a similar cutaneous insertion on the upper surface of the tip and neighbouring parts. 8. A lateral Ungual, longitudinal, altogether extrinsic in its origin ; derived from two prin- cipal sources ; one, its upper and most super- ficial portion from the fibres of the stylo- glossus, which pass forward on the side of the tongue after the insertion of that muscle into it, the other from the anterior fibres of the hyoglossus which have a similar distribution : to this may be added a slender fasciculus of fibres interposed between the styloglossus and hyoglossus, which many modern anatomists * have described as the lingual muscle. The muscle thus formed constitutes the accumula- tion of longitudiual fibres before referred to as seen at the sides of a transverse vertical section of the base; passing forwards they become fused together and spread out so as to constitute a thin layer, merging above by converging towards the medial plane of the dorsum, in the superior Ungual, below in that next to be described, and forming with them a sheath of longitudinal fibres, investing the whole surface of the tongue. €. An inferior Ungual, a stout fasciculus of longitudinal muscular fibres entirely intrinsic, arising at the base of the tongue between the hyoglossus and genioglossus, and passing forwards between these two muscles to be inserted gradually into the cutis of the tongue on the inferior surface near the apex. This is the true lingual muscle of Douglas and Al- binus, and of anatomists of the present day. I am doubtful whether or not the most an- terior fibres of the genioglossus bend for- wards so much as to become longitudinal, but I think not (though Cruveilhier says they do): if they do, the longitudinal sheath in front of the free margin of the genioglossus would consist of four sets, behind it of three. Since the longitudinal fibres invest the whole of the free surface as a sheath ; since they are, most of them, not directly, but obliquely, longitudinal; and since many of the central spread out to the sides, while the lateral converge to the centre, the division of the longitudinal Unguals into superior, lateral,TONGUE. J127 and inferior must be to some extent arbitrary : however, most of those on the upper surface are intrinsic in their origin, those at the sides are extrinsic in their origin, while those on the inferior surface are sufficiently individual and distinct: some subdivision appears ne- cessary, and the one adopted will at any rate assist in remembering these facts. The microscopical examination of thin sections. On making a thin transverse vertical section of the human tongue, and examining it with the microscope*, we see that the appearances indicated by a similar section, viewed with the naked eye, are correct, namely, that the in- trinsic muscular fibres assume three principal directions, a vertical, a transverse, and a lon- gitudinal ; and that the longitudinal are con- fined to the neighbourhood of the surface. But we see more; we see a very curious and artificial arrangement of the fibres very much contributing to facilitate their package, and by which they mutually support one another Fig. 748. it, m Transverse vertical section of the left half of the human tongue at the most posterior part of the free portion.

Place investigations is to keep a fresh human tongue two the sections on a glass slide with a drop or two of or three days in spirit, and then boil it about an water, cover them with a piece of thin glass, and hour. On being first put into the boiling water it view them with an inch, or, if a very large field contracts and becomes very hard. "When sufficiently is wanted, a two-inch object-glass, boiled, let it dry in the air for a day, and then make 4 c 4TONGUE. 1128 and act with the greatest advantage. This arrangement I shall now proceed to describe. Suppose the section made at a point just in front of the anterior free border of the genioglossi {Jig. 748.). Immediately beneath the papillae (which may be very well dis- played by this method), the condensed sub- mucous areolar tissue or cutis of the tongue is seen, of considerable thickness, being thickest on the upper surface, especially towards the middle(aa). Immediately beneath this, around the whole circumference of the tongue, is seen a very curious areolated or fenestrated ap- pearance, consisting of cross bars, branching and interlacing irregularly at various angles, leaving interspaces that are filled up by groups of discs (dd). The cross bars are at once seen to be small fasciculi of the vertical or trans- verse fibres, or both, according to the part looked at, and the groups of discs are seen to be transverse sections of the longitudinal fibres passing through the meshes formed by the vertical and transverse, which they more or less completely fill, and with whose shape they more or less exactly correspond (Jigs. 748. and 751.). The fasciculi of the longitudinal fibres are in most situations much larger than those of the vertical and transverse, among which they are contained ; indeed, the lon- gitudinal being confined to the surface, it would naturally be expected that they would preponderate there. The vertical fibres are most abundant in the vertical median plane and the horizontal in the horizontal median plane(y), the vertical not existing near the lateral surfaces, nor the transverse near the superior and inferior surface (figs. 749. a, a) ; and from this fact result almost all the pe- culiarities of arrangement of the fibres that we see. In the first place it results from this, that the vertical and horizontal fibres cross each other in the centre, which they entirely occupy, and therefore exclude the longitudinal; ac- cordingly no discs are seen in the central part of the tongue. Secondly, that at a cer- tain line (fig. 748. g.) the vertical emerge from the transverse, and are continued up or down, to the superior or inferior surface, alone; and similarly at the lateral regions the transverse emerge from the vertical, and are continued on alone to the cutis at the sides ; hence the fibres near the middle of the upper and under surface, and at the borders of the tongue, do not interlace but pass to the surface with something of parallelism; and hence the fasciculi of longitudinal fibres here are arranged, not as in the mesh of a network, but in parallel rows at right angles to the surface ; an arrangement very charac- teristic of these situations. Thirdly, it would result from this absence of vertical fibres at the sides, and of the transverse above and below, that there would be four situations (I), b, b, b, fig. 749. A .) in the neutral ground between the upper and under surfaces and the borders respectively, where there would be no cross fibres of any sort, and where the lon- gitudinal fibres would exist alone, unsupported and unseparated. Moreover, the vertical fibres at the upper and under surface, and the trans- it. 749. Plan of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue as seen in transverse section. a, a, a, a, Superior, inferior, right and left lateral regions ; b, I, b, b, right and left supra and sub-lateral regions. (Compare with4.). verse at the sides, would be so dense and numerous that they would hardly admit of any longitudinal fibres in their interspaces. Now the support and separation of the longitudinal fasciculi, and the admission of a sufficient number of them at all the superficial parts of the tongue (especially the two surfaces and the two edges, which may be called the cardinal points of the tongue with regard to its move- ments), are the two things that are especially to be brought about. To achieve this double object, the vertical and horizontal fibres, as they approach their respective surfaces, spread out in a sort of fan-like manner ; the most lateral of the vertical fibres spreading out to- wards the sides (fig. 748. k, «.), and the most superior and inferior of the transverse spread- ing up and down towards the surfaces (fig.748. i, i, fig. 749. b.). The two sets thus cross each other and fill the otherwise empty space with a network of considerable regularity and beauty, which is characteristic of these four situations, as the parallel fasciculi at right angles to the surface are characteristic of the four inter- mediate ones. For the sake of convenience I shall call the situations where the transverse and vertical fibres approach the surface in pa- rallel bundles, the siiperior, the inferior, and the right and left lateral, regions (fig. 749. a,b. a, a, a, a) : those in which they decussate as they approach the surface, I shall call the right and left supra-lateral, and the right and left sub-lateral f/g. 749. S.b,b, b,b.). Fourthly, the mesial vertical and mesial horizontal plane are the situations where the vertical and hori- zontal fibres respectively would act with the greatest power on the form of the tongue, and where also they would admit of being the1129 TONGUE. longest; hence we see the fasciculi in these situations much larger and more densely packed than in the intermediate positions, so that they more than equal the longi- tudinal fibres that they transmit. The ex- treme lateral fibres, on the other hand, that spread out and interlace, having little more for their office than to support the longitudi- nal fibres, are very small and scanty, many of them consisting of only a single fibre, and hence at these points the preponderance of the longitudinal over the vertical and hori- zontal fibres is the greatest. Fifthly, the most deep-seated of the longitudinal fibres of the upper and under surface are underlaid by a definite floor of transverse fibres, and simi- larly the deepest of those at the side are under- laid by a floor of vertical fibres; therefore in these situations there is a strong line of de- marcation, the discs are abundant down to the bottom of the cortical layer, and there they terminate suddenly {Jig. 751.); but in the in- termediate positions there is no definite floor, no line of demarcation, but the discs of lon- gitudinal fibres dip down at irregular distances (/gs.748, 749, 750.). This is the general plan and rationale of the arrangement, but it is rather an exposition than a description, and it must be understood as merely referring to a transverse vertical section of the tongue, made at the most pos- terior part of the free portion of the tongue : there are often irregularities that make it difficult to recognise the plan, and, in some situations, certain disturbing forces, and su- peradded parts that quite upset its symmetry. For example, behind the anterior third of the tongue, the genioglossus is seen entering its inferior surface, and displacing all longi- tudinal fibres {fig- 747. d) ; further back, this displacement is more considerable, and we have similar infringements from other muscles; and the intermixture of fat towards the base of the tongue tends materially to upset the regularity of the muscular arrange- ment. Yet, in spite of this, it may always be detected, and the average of appearances will be such as I have described. The muscular fibres are neither straight nor parallel ; those of each system maintain their general direction, but their course is wavy and tortuous, and characterised by the utmost irregularity ; as the fibres pass out- wards they branch and sometimes re-unite {figs. 750, 751.), though their branchings are much more frequent than their re-unions, and hence the fasciculi are smaller and more numerous near the periphery than towards the centre (fig. 751.) ; by these branchings of the fasciculi each set of fibres, the vertical or transverse, possesses what may be called an intrinsic network, imperfectly marked cer- tainly, but sufficient in some parts to mask their parallelism and to break up the rows of longitudinal fibres that are packed between them. The number of fibres in each of the vertical or transverse fasciculi, varies according to the part of the section viewed, and the situation in the tongue trom which it is taken ; some- times one single fibre constitutes the fasci- culus, if one may say so, sometimes many dozen. Some of the largest are the most superior of the horizontal,— those that curve up on each side towards the upper surface {fig. 750.). The same variety of size exists in Fig. 750. Portion of cortical layer of the right snpra-lateral region of the tongue, showing the interlacement of a, a, the horizontal with b, b, the vertical fibres, the longitudinal fibres filling the intervals having been removed. Magnified 30 diameters. the discs of longitudinal fibres cut across; the number of fibres in them may be counted, from two or three to thirty or forty : those nearest the surface are certainly the smallest, and they do not completely fill the meshes of the muscular network through which they pass {Jig. 751.), but a certain quantity of fibrous tissue dips down among them: this, however, only for a little way. The shape of the longi- tudinal bundles is as various as their size — circular, polygonal, triangular, elliptical, in fact, every conceivable shape {fig. 751.); they seem moulded by the fibres among which they lie, or, more correctly, they and the others among which they lie, mutually regu- late each other's shape and direction. The peculiarity, then, of the arrangement of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue is this : — that there are three sets of fibres passing through the same area, and acting in three different directions; that these three direc- tions are, in the main, at right angles the one to the other, in fact, that they coincide with1130 TONGUE. the three axes of the cube; that to facilitate this arrangement, a beautiful system of pack- Fig. 751.

(Magnified 30 diameters.') a, vertical fibres; b, topmost stratum of the horizontal; c, longitudinal, in section, occupying the interspaces between the vertical. age is adopted, whereby each of these is enabled to pass in a straight line to its destin- ation without being interfered with by the other two ; whereby the individual bundles of each set are isolated from their fellows ; whereby the whole of them are contained in the smallest possible compass ; whereby they not only admit the passage of, but mutually support and conduct each other ; whereby, in consequence of this, they are enabled to dis- pense with the support of cellular tissue, which accordingly we find absent; whereby, lastly, the tongue contains the greatest amount of muscular tissue possible for its bulk. This system of package consists of this — that the crossing of the fibres of any two sets forms a lattice work, or mesh, through which the third shall pass, and that the successive layers of the crossing fibres shall be so arranged that the areola shall form continuous channels for the transmission of the perforating ones. In whatever plane we look at the fibres, we find that this is the case — that two sets are crossing fibres and one set perforating — that two are seen in profile, one in section ; but, as we vary the plane, so do we vary the ap- pearance of the fibres, one set alone remain- ing the same and two interchanging. Thus, in a transverse vertical section the transverse and vertical fibres are seen in profile, and the longitudinal in section ; in a longitudinal ver- tical section the vertical and longitudinal are in profile, and the transverse in section ; while again, in the horizontal section, the trans- verse and longitudinal are seen in profile, and the vertical in section. So, no set can be called a perforating set or a crossing set,— they are all equally so. Again, we see that the office of the longi- tudinal fibres requires that they should have that special superficial arrangement which is the only one left them by the necessary dis- position of the other two. The chief office of the longitudinal fibres is to alter the direction of the tongue longitudinally, to twist it from side to side, or up and down ; any thing but a superficial distribution would render them powerless for this act. For if the longitu- dinal fibres were placed in the centre, it is evident that they could only shorten the tongue; but,being arranged superficially, when a portion of them contracts, that side of the tongue on which the contracting ones are is shortened more than the rest; in other words, the tongue is turned towards that side ; and it is only when the whole sheath of longi- tudinal fibres acts equally that the tongue is contracted directly backwards. Having premised this general description, I shall now proceed to give a particular ac- count of the microscopical appearances of successive sections made in the three prin- cipal planes — the transverse, the longitudinal, and the horizontal. I shall begin with the transverse as being the clearest and the most illustrative. The first transverse vertical sections, made at the tip of the tongue, of course remove successive portions of the papillary structure : we next come to the cutis — the dense areolar tissue subtending the papillae — and many sections are made before the appearance of any muscle ; we have in fact to get through the thickness of the cutis. The first muscular fibres that make their appearance are the transverse, consisting of a single slender bundle of fibres in that direction, occupying nearly a middle plane between the upper and under surfaces, lying horizontally, collected into a single bundle in the centre, but breaking up at each end into smaller fasciculi, which diverge as they pass to their insertion into the cutis at the sides of the tongue, so as to gain a more extended attachment. The sections following this display an increasing quantity of this muscle, the diameter of the unbroken bundle in the centre being greater, and the fasciculi into which it divides at the sides more numerous ; but as yet no other system of fibres has appeared. The next addition, as we proceed backwards, is that of vertical fibres, which are at first very few and scanty, and placed not in the centre, but in two sets, one on each side of the centre ; they converge a little as they pass upwards, and are rather curved, presenting their concavity outwards. The succeeding sections show them increasing in numbers and spread-1131 TONGUE. ing towards the centre, where the}' finally meet, and then the central part of the tongue is con- stituted in the same way as it is throughout the whole succeeding length of the organ, namely, by decussating vertical and transverse fibres ; but as yet no longitudinal fibres have appeared, and they are not seen till after the transverse area of the tongue has been entirely occupied by the vertical and hori- zontal fibres as above described. They first appear at the inferior surface, then at the sublateral and lateral regions ; next they are seen at the centre of the upper surface in a small definite cluster, from which they spread out, and so complete the circumference of the tongue. We see from this that the fibres that occupy the extreme point of the tongue are the transverse; that the next met with are the vertical; and that the longitudinal do not extend so far forward as either of the other two. This is what might be expected. The chief muscular, requisition at the extremity of the tongue is the power of pointing it : the shape of a tactile part is eminently subservient to its power of touch, because exact localisation, which is a most impor- tant element in touch (if it is not the very essence of it), depends on the smallness of the touching part. Now the extremity of the tongue, of its ordinary broad, flat shape when at rest, would be a very poor tactile instrument, and very far removed from a form that would capacitate it for the minute ap- preciation of distance and form. In what way, then, is the desired pointed shape of the tip of the tongue to be produced ? Manifestly by transverse contraction, for it is by the spread of the tongue in this direction that it departs from the pointed form ; and so we see the transverse fibres continued beyond either of the others, and occupying at the extreme tip the whole of the space assigned to the muscular structure. Furthermore, the longi- tudinal fibres are not necessary at the extreme point, either to flatten or shorten the tip, which is brought about by its own elasticity immediately on the cessation of the con- traction of the transverse fibres, or to move it in any direction, which is done rather by the movements of the parts coming immediately next the tip than of the tip itself. Thus, both negatively and positively, we see a reason for the continuation of the transverse fibres further forwards than either of the other two sets. The section last described completes what may be called the theoretical structure of the tongue (it is shown in fg. 748., in one half of its extent) : the next change is one of in- fraction of that completeness of muscular structure, occasioned by the entrance of the genioglossi muscles on the inferior surface, whereby the continuity of the cortical layer is isolated, there being no discs in the space occupied by the immergence of these two mus- cles. The subsequent changes in the appear- ance of successive sections, are just such as might be expected from the description al- ready given of such sections when viewed by the naked eye ; therefore, for the sake of brevity, I shall not here advert to them. A longitudinal vertical section, of course, displays a reversing of the position in which the discs and profile interlacement are re- spectively seen ; the discs are here in the central part instead of in the cortical, being the transverse fibres cut across ; the cortical layer is free from discs (except where, from the vertical and longitudinal fibres being ob- lique, they are obliquely cut), and is occupied by the longitudinal and vertical fibres, both seen in profile. A horizontal section displays very much the same appearance as the last: the discs are in the central part, and there is an absence of them in the circumferential portion; but in this case the discs are of the vertical fibres, in the other they were of the transverse. Superficial sections, or sections made ob- liquely, I shall not attempt to describe; by such means the appearances might be in- finitely varied, but their description would merely tend to confusion. From the above account it is seen that the microscopical investigation of the subject not only confirms and proves the conclusion ar- rived at by other means, but adds many new and interesting facts, and supplies us with one more instance of that contrivance and adapta- tion of means to end that meets us at every point. I have entered rather fully into the intrinsic muscular arrangements of the tongue, because there is no good account of the subject, that I can find, in the English language, nor of the appearances as seen by the microscope, in any language ; and I considered such an account a desideratum. Mode of termination of the intrinsic fibres. — All the intrinsic fibres of the tongue, and indeed, it may be said, almost if not quite all of the extrinsic too, terminate by becoming in- serted into the cutis — the sub-mucous fibrous tissue — which is extremely dense and thick, particularly on the upper surface. The trans- verse and vertical fibres pass direct to the cutis ; the longitudinal all ultimately have a similar insertion. In vertical sections the fibres may be seen passing up or down to the sur- face, and entering the cutis, which having pierced for a certain extent, they terminate : — some of them end just as they enter the fibrous tissue; some of them may be traced quite up to the papilla?. It might naturally be expected that the muscular fibres of the tongue would, from their isolation, present great facilities for see- ing the mode of the termination of muscle in fibrous tissue; and indeed this is the case in a remarkable degree; they seem to furnish the great desideratum of a natural isolation of the individual fibres, at the point where you are sure of seeing their union with the fibrous tissue that forms their means of attachment. As the opinions that 1 have come to from my own observations differ from those that are the result of some of the best researches onTONGUE. 1132 the subject that have been made, namely those of Mr. Bowman, as published in the " Philo- sophical Transactions," and in the " Physio- logical Anatomy" of himself and Dr. Todd, I would advance them with diffidence, and some- thing like hesitation. The appearances that I have invariably seen, by daily examinations for some time, of sections from many tongues, is this: each fibre, before its termination, gradu- ally tapers, in a fusiform manner, with more or less of acuteness ; sometimes the tapering is rather sudden, in other cases very much pro- longed (Jig. 752. a) ; in all the tapering is con- Fig. 752. A. Fasciculus of the vertical fibres of the tongue, showing their fusiform extremities and the ter- mination of each muscular fibre in a filament of white fibrous tissue. (Magnified 100 diameters. B. Magnified 200 diameters). tinued so far that the muscular tissue becomes nearly as fine as the fibrous tissue in which it terminates: from this fine extremity the fibre passes off, and the appearances at the point of transition are of two sorts ; the one as seen at B, a, where the muscle passes smoothly off in the fibrous tissue, and you cannot tell where the one commences and the other ends ; the other as seen at b, b , where the pointed extremity of the muscle is a little rounded, and its outline plainly visible ; but in this case, also, the diameter of the extremity of the muscle as nearly as possible coincides with that of the fibre. It is possible that the dif- ference of appearance may depend in some degree upon difference of focus, but, certainly, I have not been able, in some cases, by any adjustment of focus, to get a clear definition of the point where the muscular structure termi- nated. In those cases where the outline of the termination of the muscle is defined, the transverse striation may be traced up to its very extremity ; where the outline of the one merges in that of the other, the stria? seem also gradually to be lost, becoming a linear series of little dots, and so fading awaj' (b, a). The conclusion that the appearance at once suggested to me was, that the sarcolemma, condensed by the diminution of its contents, passed off from the acuminated extremity as a tendon of white fibrous tissue ; and this opinion was confirmed when I thought of the genesis of these structures. If, as seems probable from the account given by Schwann and other physiologists of the de- velopment of muscle, the sarcolemma is the persistent cell-wall of the original for- mation-cells of the fibre, and if white fibrous tissue is true zellenfasern — altered cell-wall of cells that have become elongated at their opposite nodes, and plicated as it were, — then we reduce the sarcolemma and the white fibrous tissue to the same category — altered cell-wall. The function of the cell- wall of the muscle-cell is to secrete that peculiar matter within it which ultimately becomes sarcous matter; the function of the cell-wall of the fibre-cell is to become elon- gated and plicated, or otherwise longitudinally striated. To explain, therefore, the gradual passage of one structure into the other, we have merely to suppose, on the part of the cell- wall, the gradual mergence of one function, and taking on of the other. These considera- tions at any rate tend to obviate any ante- cedent objections to the opinions suggested by the appearances, that would have arisen if there had been any thing essentially heteroge- neous in the nature of the structures con- cerned. The fact, that Mr. Bowman's obser- vations were made on the lower animals — fish, Crustacea, and insects — may perhaps account for the difference of the appearances. It is a subject that requires more investiga- tion, and no structures seem to me so much adapted for this purpose as the tongues of the lower vertebrata. A. Extrinsic muscles of the tongue. —-These are four in number, the ■palatoglossus, the stylo- glossus, the hyoglossus, and the genioglossus; at- taching the tongue to the soft palate, base of the skull, hyoid bone, and lower jaw, and mov- ing it nearly in the lour cardinal directions, up- wards, downwards, backwards, and forwards. They are all more or less of a mixed nature, being continued in some degree into the tongue. They move the organ en masse, and attach it to distant parts by virtue of their extrinsic portion ; they contribute to the sub- stance of the organ, and affect its form, by virtue of their intrinsic portion. It is this continuity of the substance of the tongue with its means of connection to distant parts that makes those connections so strong and safe; it is this prolongation of the extrinsic muscles into the tongue that renders the association of the extrinsic and intrinsic movements so intimate. The 2,alat°gl°sslls (glosso-staphylinus), the smallest of these muscles, constitutes the connection between the soft palate and the sides of the tongue. At its origin in the soft palate its fibres are mingled with those of the palatopharyngeus ; as it descends to the tongue it becomes much narrower, constitut-11.33 TONGUE. ing the anterior pillar of the fauces ; and arrived at the sides of the tongue, it again spreads out, and its fibres mingle with those of the styloglossus, some of them passing transversely into the medullary structure. It lies immediately beneath the mucous mem- brane, and in front of the tonsil. Action : To constrict the fauces (hence its name, con- strictor isthmi faucium) by depressing the soft palate and raising the sides of the tongue. The styloglossus. — A small slender muscle arising by a pointed tendinous origin from the inferior half of the styloid process of the tem- poral bone, and also slightly from the stylo- maxillary ligament. It passes downwards and inwards to the base of the tongue, opposite to which it expands and becomes flattened; a few of its fibres bend inwards, the majority being continued longitudinally along the side of the tongue, where they may be traced to near the apex, contributing to the formation of the lateral lingual muscle. As they pass forward, they mingle with those fibres of the hyoglossus that have a similar direction, and with the inferior lingual. Relations: Ex- ternally, with the parotid and submaxillary glands, the external carotid artery, the facial artery, the Whartonian duct, the lingual branch of the fifth nerve, and the stylomax- illary ligament ; internally, with the stylo- hyoid ligament, internal carotid, superior constrictor of the pharynx, the jugular vein, and hyoglossus muscle. Action: To retract the tongue, to raise and expand its base, and to render it concave from side to side by rais- ing its borders. The hyoglossus.— Flat, thin, and ascending nearly vertically, this muscle approaches a quadrilateral form ; but, from the dorsum of the tongue ascending as it passes forwards, its anterior border is much larger than its posterior. It arises from the posterior ex- tremity, and from the superior border and outer surface of the greater cornua of the os hyoides, and from the body in their immediate neighbourhood. From this double origin the fibres ascend in two distinct sets. Those from the greater cornua, passing up nearly parallel to one another, are inserted into the sides of the tongue; those from the body expand as they ascend, arch forwards, and, gaining the side of the tongue at a point su- perior and anterior to the other, pass forward along the border of the tongue, and unite with the styloglossus to form the lateral lingual. These two portions are separated below by a cellular interval ; and above a few fibres of the styloglossus pass in between them. Al- bums has described these as three distinct muscles : one, the cerato-glossus, arising from the greater cornua ; another, the basio-glossus, from the body : and a third, intermediate, the chondro-glossus, taking its origin from the lesser cornua. Relations: The external relations of this muscle are, -— from above downwards, with the submaxillary gland, the hypoglossal nerve, the mylohyoid, stylo- hyoid, and digastric muscles; internally, it covers the glosso-phar)ngeal nerve, the middle constrictor of the pharynx, the lingual ar- tery, the stylohyoid ligament, the geniohyo- glossus, anil, at its attachment to the tongue, the inferior lingualis, which separates it from the last mentioned. Bichat erroneously states that the lingual artery ordinarily passes be- tween its two origins. Action: To depress the sides of the tongue and render its dorsum convex; to retract the tongue and draw it downwards. It is more frequently associated with other muscles than isolated in its action ; and accordingly as it acts alone or together with other muscles, either as concurring with them or antagonising them, so its actions vary. The genioglossus, the largest of all the mus- cles of the tongue, which it connects to the lower jaw, is of a radiated or fan-shape, and is placed vertically in immediate contact with its fellow of the opposite side. It arises from the superior genial tubercle of the lower jaw by a tendinous tuft from which the muscular fibres radiate to their different destinations. The most anterior, the shortest, forming the anterior free margin of the muscle, pass up- wards and forwards to the tongue, having reached the under surface of which, they are continued, according to Cruveilhier, on that surface to the tip ; but in all the specimens that I have examined they appeared to con- tinue an oblique course to the dorsum. The succeeding fibres pass more and more back- wards, and having reached the inferior surface of the tongue, are directed vertically to the dorsum, into the middle line of the whole of which they are inserted, from apex to base. The two muscles may be separated up to the point of their immergence into the tongue, but beyond that line their separation is no longer possible; for, having entered the tongue, they come into relation with the transverse intrinsic fibres, which they cut at right angles, and interlacing with which they pass to the cutis of the dorsum, forming part of the vertical intrinsic muscle, from the rest of which they are not to be dis- tinguished except by their mesial situation. The fibres do not curve outwards, as sup- posed by Marjolin, to form part of the transverse lingual; nor do they expand at all at their insertion, as stated by Cru- veilhier ; there is no disposition to lateral divergence in any part of their course ; on the contrary, their direction is rather upwards and inwards throughout, and their insertion extremely narrow — a mere line — as it might be imagined it would be, when its great longitudinal extent is remembered. The longitudinal furrow is, I think, mainly produced by the traction of this muscle in the median line. The most inferior fibres pass backwards and downwards, and are inserted into the hyoglossal ligament. Some of the fibres immediately above pass backwards, ac- cording to some authors, to the sides of the pharynx, where, uniting with the middle con- strictor, they form the genio-pharyngiens of Winslow. Relations: Internally with its fellow, being separated merely by areolar tissue con-TONGUE. 1134 taining some fat, particularly at its inferior part and the median fibrous lamina, when the in- termuscular areolar tissue is sufficiently dense to deserve that name; anteriorly, with the f'rae- num, to which it is subjacent; inferiorly, with the geniohyoid; and externally, with the sub- lingual gland, the mylohyoid, hyoglossus, and interior lingualis muscles, the ranine artery, and the gustatory nerve. The hypoglossal nerve threads its fibres, and passes forwards among them. Action: To raise and draw forwards the tongue ; to assist in constricting the pharynx ; to protrude, retract, or depress the tongue in the mouth, according as all or part of the fibres are employed ; to depress the centre of the tongue, and render it concave, from side to side. c. Accessory extrinsic muscles. — These are, in short, all the muscles that move the os hyoides without being attached to the tongue, for whatever moves the hyoid bone must move the tongue, which is fixed to it. They are accessory to theproper extrinsic muscles in two ways, either by acting in con- cert with them, or by facilitating their action on the tongue by rendering the hyoid bone a fixed point. Thus, in the first method, the stylohyoid and posterior belly of the digas- tricus concur with the styloglossus in draw- ing the tongue upwards and backwards. In the same way, the anterior belly of the digas- tricus, the mylohyoid, and geniohyoid, con- cur with the inferior portion of the genio- glossus in raising and drawing forwards the hyoid bone, and facilitating the protrusion of the tongue from the mouth. By the second method the muscles from the styloid process to the hyoid bone assist the longitudinal in- trinsic muscles of the tongue by rendering the base a fixed point from which they can ad- vantageously act on its length, and in the same way the inferior set of hyoidean muscles are accessory to the hyoglossus by fixing the hyoid bone down. More might be said on this subject, but enough has been stated to indicate the important relation of these muscles to the proper muscles of the tongue, and for the sake of brevity that may suffice. Movements of the tongue. — All the infinite variety of movements by which the tongue is, by virtue of its complex muscular organisa- tion, susceptible, may be arranged under two heads,—its extrinsic and intrinsic move- ments ; sometimes dissociated, more fre- quently concurrent: for the sake of clearness I shall consider them separately, and then group them. First, the intrinsic movements of the tongue are of two sorts ; those affecting its length, and those affecting its direction. a. As affecting its length. The elongation of the tongue is provided for, like all in- trinsic elongation, by diminution of calibre ; in the tongue this is produced by transverse and vertical contraction, especially the transverse, whereby the tongue becomes at once elon- gated and pointed; by this means the tip of the tongue can be protruded beyond the teeth without any movement of the organ en masse, or any assistance of the extrinsic muscles. From this elongated state it is restored to its original position and shape by the contraction of all the longitudinal fibres composing the cortical portion, which draw it directly back, the transverse and vertical fibres at the same time ceasing to act. Thus we see that the central and cortical portions of the intrinsic muscles are antagonistic ; but they are capable of association : for instance, when the tongue is to be flattened and its sides pressed against the teeth without any elongation, an action very frequent in mastication and in the pro- nunciation of some letters, this is done by the contraction of the vertical fibres associ- ated with the longitudinal, the one diminishing the vertical thickness, and so spreading the tongue out, the other preventing the elonga- tion which the diminution of vertical thick- ness would otherwise be attended with. b. As affecting its direction. The direction of the tongue is entirely regulated, as far as the intrinsic muscles go, by the longitudinal fibres, and their power of modifying the direc- tion of the tongue, as well as shortening it, depends on their power of partial action : thus the lateral lingual of one side can act, or of the other; the superior or the inferior, and the point of the tongue is of course moved to the side of the acting muscle. This modi- fication of the direction of the tongue is, per- haps, the most complete movement that it possesses; it is certainly the most extensive : by it the tip of the tongue may be depressed deep below the incisor teeth, or reflected back on the soft palate, so as nearly to touch the uvula; or laterally, from the pillars of the fauces on one side it may be carried round the cheeks and alveolar arches to the same position on the other side: these are the cardinal points, up and down, right and left; they may be united in any proportions, so as to carry the extremity of the tongue to any intermediate position. Moreover, the movements affecting the length of the tongue may concur with those affecting its direction; for instance, on apply- ing the tip of the tongue to the root of a canine tooth of the upper jaw, on the outer surface of the alveolus, the tongue is elon- gated, and vertico-laterally flexed; on apply- ing it to the last molar tooth of the lower jaw it is laterally flexed and shortened. Secondly, the extrinsic movements of the tongue admit of the same division as the intrinsic, into those regulating its length, and those regulating its direction or shape. a. Thus the tongue is carried upwards and backwards by the styloglossus, assisted by the other styloid muscles, downwards and backwards by the hyoglossus, directly back- wards when these both concur; and it is carried forwards and protruded from the mouth by the genioglossus. These move- ments, en masse, almost always concur with the intrinsic movements, the whole organ following to a certain extent the direction of the extremity. b. But the extrinsic muscles affect veryTONGUE. 1135 materially the direction and shape of the tongue: the styloglossi raise and expand the sides, the palatoglossi raise and approximate them, and the hyoglossi depress them; the one set makes the dorsum of the tongue transversely concave, the other convex : moreover, the posterior fibres of the genio- glossus draw the centre of the tongue for- wards and downwards, so that they also render the tongue transversely concave. The action of the genioglossus is peculiar; the most posterior fibres draw forwards the base of the tongue, and are those chiefly concerned in the protrusion of the organ ; the most anterior concur in replacing the tongue when thus protruded ; when the whole muscle acts it compresses the tongue into a sort of button, and carries it deep down in the arch of the lower jaw. The relations of the hyoglossus and genioglossus are worthy of remark: they are congeners, inasmuch as they both tend to draw the tongue downwards ; they are antagonists, inasmuch as the one tends to draw the tongue principally forwards, the other principally backwards; when all four muscles act, the tongue is depressed deep in the jaw, but further back than when the genioglossi act alone ; when the two muscles of one side act, that side alone is depressed, and a certain torsion is given to the tongue which enables it to 'apply the tip advantageously to parts that it would otherwise be very difficult to reach. ]f the movement of the tongue in transferring the tip from the last inferior molar tooth of one side to that of the other be watched, with the mouth open, at a glass, it will be seen to be collected in a globe at the back of the mouth, and to rotate horizontally, as it were on a pivot. The only way in which I can conceive this movement to be brought about, is by the consentaneous action of the hyo- glossus of the one side with the genioglossus of the other, — the one right with the other left, then the one left with the other right, and so on, the styloglossi and palatoglossi at the same time preventing the depression of the tongue. But it would be vain to attempt to describe in words the endless variety of movements of which the tongue is susceptible; and if it were possible to give an idea of them, space could not be afforded: so, dismissing this part of my subject, I will proceed to the next. 3. Tegiimentary system. — The tegumentary system of the tongue is formed by the mucous membrane of the mouth passing on to it from neighbouring parts, and undergoing special modifications according to the part that it invests. A superficial glance shows it at once to admit of a triple division, into, first, a really or apparently plane portion, situated in front of the epiglottis, beneath the borders, and on the free portion of the under surface ; secondly, a papillary portion, covering the anterior two-thirds of the upper surface, the free borders, and the tip ; and, thirdly, a glandular portion, occupying the posterior third of the upper surface, where it is folded into little crypts and raised in nodules over small mucous glands: these glands exist also* along the sides and beneath the tip : they will be reserved for future description. The mucous membrane here, as elsewhere, consists of three portions, — a basement or limitary membrane, underlaid by a submucous areolar tissue, and surmounted by an epithe- lium. a. Cutis.—The sub-basement areolar tissue of the tongue exists in sufficient quantity and density to deserve the name of a true chorion or cutis. It is thickest at the upper surface, where it underlays the papillae, espe- cially towards the median line; its density too is the greatest here, sometimes amounting to almost a cartilaginous hardness, and the pro- portion of white fibrous tissue to the yellow is the greatest; it is thinnest on the under surface and edges, where it contains more ot the elastic element, especially in the neigh- bourhood of the epiglottis ; at the line where the attached and free portions of the tongue meet, it gradually merges off into the loose elastic web that underlays the mucous surface in these situations. Its inner surface receives the insertion of all the intrinsic muscles of the tongue, among which for a short distance it dips, and it sends processes into the folds that attach the tongue to neighbouring parts, as the glosso-epiglottidean and frasnum. It is the medium in which the nerves and vessels destined to the surface break up previous to their ultimate distribution : the vascular rami- fications form a plane network, coincident with the surface, from which, at regular intervals, the papillary vessels ascend. b. The basement membrane is variously modified in the three situations above indi- cated; it is either continued plane, projected into papillae, or folded into mucous crypts, from which its further involution constitutes the minute ducts and ultimate follicles of the mucous glands opening into these crypts: its description will be involved in the particular consideration of these structures. c. Epithelium.—This very nearly approaches in character the cuticle of the skin, which it resembles in being of the scaly variety, in the amount to which it exists, and in its being divisible into two layers, a deep one closely adherent to the basement membrane, consist- ing of more recent cells, retaining much of the cellular form (Jig. 753., c.), and a superficial one, readily desquamating, the cells of which are older and flattened into scales (Jig. 753.. d.). It exists in very different quantity in different parts, being most abundant where it invests the papillary structures. The shape of the in- dividual cells is very various ; where they are flattened their area is much extended (Jig. 753., a.), and they look four or five times as lame as the deep-seated ones; but probably there is no increase in size, their lateral extension resulting from their greater thinness: viewed in profile they appear quite filamentary ; some of them are not flattened but elongated, so that they appear linear in all aspects, and are really so. In spite of all these modificationsTONGUE. 1136 Fig. 753. a, a single flattened superficial cell, viewed super- ficially and edgewise; b, from the horse, showing the filamentary prolongation of a part only of each cell; d, superficial; c, deep layer. a small single circular nucleus may generally be seen very plainly occupying a central posi- tion in the cell, and unchanged in form and size by any of the changes that the cell under- goes. Certainly the epithelium, covering most parts of the tongue, does not contain any pigment; but I think that covering the filiform papillae in the centre of the dorsum very frequently does ; and for these reasons,— because, first, the growth of the epithelium here is very abundant, and it seems a general rule that pigment should be associated with an abundantly nourished or rapidly developed epidermis, as is seen in hair, in the colour of those spots that are called moles, and the hair that proceeds from them, which, instead of being invisible, as in neighbouring parts, is dark and rank, and in the change of colour which the cuticle and hair covering the parts of genera- tion undergo at the increase of the nutrition of the parts that accompanies the accession of the generative function ; secondly, because we see that the epithelium does undergo great changes of colour, being generally dark- est when most abundant; thirdly, because, in two cases that I have seen, in which the only diseased condition was an enormous develop- ment of the filiform processes which the epi- thelium forms in the centre of the tongue, the colour of the fur was a dark sepia or Vandyke brown, almost black, exactly that of pigment in other situations: we see too, when the epithelium has been rendered opaque by soaking the tongue in alcohol, that all the other papillae are whiter than the fili- form occupying the centre of the dorsum, which retain their tawny colour. The epithe- lium of the tongue differs from the dermic cuticle chiefly in its moisture, and the delicacy and softness of its structure. Papillary structure of the tongue. — The pa- pilla; of the tongue are generally contrasted with those of the skin, in that while the latter are covered over with an even layer of epi- dermis, and therefore not visible to the naked eye, the latter stand out free from the surface of the epithelium, dipping down between them. But viewed by the light of recent researches, this is seen to be only the appa- rent difference, the real difference being that while the papillae of the skin are sessile, the papillae of the tongue are arranged in groups on proper pedicles or supports, whose tops and sides they cover, and which elevate them above the general surface. For it has been recently shown by Professors Todd and Bow- man *, that the papillae, heretofore considered simple, are really compound organs, and that they are covered by other smaller papillae, whose form and whose method of nervous and vascular supply, show their true analogy to the papillae of the skin. In physiological exactness, and to carry out the analogy insti- tuted by these anatomists, we may say that these large papillae, so called, are no more true papilla?, than the long processes in the intes- tine of the rhinoceros are true villi. Now, these secondary, or true physiological papillae, are covered in by an even layer of epithelium, in just the same way as the papilla? of the skin; hence we see that the distinction gene- rally laid down ceases. It would, however, be too great an innovation to reject the name of papillae for those organs that have so long possessed it, and as the value and office of their different parts will be implied in their description, no misconception can arise. I shall, therefore, continue the old nomen- clature. There are three principal forms under which the papillae, visible to the naked eye, exist on the surface of the tongue. 1st. The circumvallate (caliciform, Cuv.), the largest and fewest in number, and the most conspicuous, situated at the junction of the middle and posterior third of the tongue, where, by their arrangement in two lines, having a direction backwards and inwards, which meet in the centre, they form a V-shaped ridge, with the base directed forwards ; 2nd. The fungiform, more numerous than the last mentioned, and smaller, irregularly scattered over the centre, sides, and apex of the tongue ; and, 3rd, The conical or filiform, by far the most numerous and smallest, arranged in a dense pile over the whole anterior two-thirds of the upper surface, among which the last-mentioned are im- planted. To these may be added a fourth class of simple sessile papilla?, first pointed out by Professors Todd and Bowman as existing on the apparently non-papillary surface im- mediately behind the circumvallate papilla?, and which I have found also to exist on the whole of the under surface of the free portion of the tongue. The circumvallate papilla? are of the most complex form, and may be considered as con- sisting of two parts — a central, button-like projection, flattened or truncated at its free surface, and a raised border surrounding it in the form of a ring, of nearly equal elevation with the central part, the two portions being separated by a circumvallation, or fossa (b). When a vertical section is made of one of these papillae (7%. 754.), the central portion is seen to be in the form of an inverted cone, and the surrounding fold is seen to constitute a cup, at the bottom of which the apex of the * Physiological Anatomy, vol. i. p. 435.TONGUE. 1137 Fig. 754. Circumvallate papilla seen in vertical section, a, Truncated surface, or base of the cone; b, cir- cumvallation; c, raised border. (Mag. 16 diam.) cone is attached. At the attached portion the nerves and vessels enter, and the free trun- cated surface, or base, of the cone is covered with small secondary papilla;, concealed by the epithelium (Jig. 754. a) ; the free border is also surmounted by secondary papillae, so that it is, in fact, a circular compound papilla (c). The circumvallate papillae possess the utmost irregularity as to size, number, shape, and arrangement. Their number has been much overstated by some anatomists; C'ruveilhier gives it as from sixteen to twenty, Marjolin from nine to fifteen, Soemmering from twelve to fourteen, and Meckel from three to twenty. I think the number given by Messrs. Todd and Bowman, as from eight to ten, is much nearer the truth ; certainly, if ten can be counted, they must be considered well deve- loped ; frequently the number is below this — I have seen as few as five, or even four. In size they vary from that of an ordinary fungi- form papilla to upwards of £th of an inch in diameter. They always assume more or less of the V-shaped arrangement, but the per- fection with which the linear series is main- tained, the straightness of the lines that form the angle, and the size of the angle so formed, all vary very much ; I have seen them stretch- ing across from side to side of the tongue, almost in a straight line, with a third arm projecting back from the centre, something like the form of a tripod ; it is not uncommon to find a stray one or two scattered to a great distance beyond the prescribed line; the cen- tral one is frequently thrown back half an inch, and sometimes a lateral one is found Fig. quite at the edge of the tongue. In shape, the varieties are chiefly owing to the relative size and development of the central tubercle and the circular ridge surrounding it. Sometimes one of these parts is suppressed, and then you either get what appears to be a large fungiform papilla, or a set of ridges having something of a circular or quadrilateral ar- rangement, not to be distinguished from the fused rows of conical papillae which surround the circumvallate on all sides, and which are, in fact, continuations and prolongations of their calices. Haller mentions having seen the circumvallate papilla; in two rows on each side ; I have met with a similar arrange- ment on one side. This appearance may in some degree be accounted for by the supposi- tion that the rows of conical papilla?, among which the large fungiform immediately in front of the circumvallate are planted, have attained a circular or calyx-like arrangement around them ; for a large fungiform papillae, situated in a calyx so formed, would produce a very perfect papilla circumvallata. This change is just the reverse of that which reduces a cir- cumvallate papilla to a fungiform by the sup- pression of its surrounding ridge, and both, no doubt, are sources of irregularity. These papillae are supplied by branches from the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which may be dis- tinctly traced to them ; their vascular supply is abundant, and their epithelium thin and fine, so that during life, and when injected, they appear very red. The fungiform papillae, as their name indi- cates, have more or less of the form of a sphere supported on a pedicle; this is their typical form, but they often deviate from it ; in size they vary from J^th to -g^th of an inch. They are scattered over the sides and tip of the tongue, and on the dorsum in front of the circumvallate. They may be dis- tinguished from the filiform, among which they are implanted, by their red colour, in which, in the thinness and smooth- ness of the epithelium investing them, and in the abundance of their vascular and nervous supply, they resemble those last de- scribed. When examined microscopically, they are seen to be covered on their sides and summit with secondary papillae (y?g.755.A),to 755.

(After Todd and Bowman.) 4 DTONGUE. ] 138 which, in injected specimens, the individual loops of capillaries may be seen projecting with great regularity and beauty (B). The fungiform papillae are largest about the centre of the tongue, smallest along the edges, and most numerous at the sides of the tip, but they are liable to the greatest variety in their size and distribution ; I have seen them so large about the centre of the tongue, as almost to equal in size the circumvallate ; I have seen them so numerous at the tip, as nearly to equal in number the filiform among which they were scattered ; again, in the same region, I have seen them so scanty, that they could hardly be said to exist there.* The conical or filiform papillae, the third class, constitute the great mass of the papillary structure; they cover, in a close-set pile, the whole of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, being limited behind by the circum- vallate, and having the fungiform scattered among them : it is their structure that imparts the rough coriaceous character to the papil- lary surface, and they constitute the fur in the centre. They are altogether smaller, but in length they exceed, at least in the centre, the other two forms, and they exhibit greater di- versity of structure and a more complete ab- sence of typical shape than either of the other varieties. They affect in some situations a Fig. 756.

In the first-mentioned situation their rows run forwards and outwards, coinciding with the arms of the V-shaped figure that the cir- cumvallate papillae assume ; in the last-men- tioned, they are placed vertically along the sides (fig. 745. ii) : they have been well de- scribed and figured by Soemmering.* Along the centre of the tongue, in the neighbourhood of the median furrow, the conical papillae often assume a cracked and fissured appearance ; but the linear arrangement is less marked here, and the fissures have no determinate direc- tion, but can be made and effaced according to the movements of the tongue. The conical papillae are largest in the neighbourhood of the circumvallate, where they are truncated, and where some of them assume almost a fungiform shape: they are longest about the centre of the tongue, near the median line, and smallest in the anterior part, near the side and tip.

But it is in the epithelium that the characteristic difference between these and the other papillae * Icones Organorum humanorum gustus et rocis. Francofurti, 1808.TONGUE 1139 4- d 2 is to be found. In the other forms we saw it continued over the whole compound organ as a thin indusium, covering in and concealing the secondary papillae under its smooth invest- ment, the scales being arranged parallel to the surface; but in the conical and filiform papillae we not only see the epithelium exist- ing in much greater quantity, but over each secondary papilla assuming a vertical arrange- ment, and, after continuing compact for some little distance, breaking up into a brush of hair-like processes {fig. 756.), the number coinciding with that of the secondary papilla?. Where the secondary papillas are few the hairs are few, where they are many the hairs are many, and each hair may be traced down, by following the line in which the epithelium is vertical, to each papilla. In fact, these pro- cesses are true hairs, and only differ from other hairs in being short, uncompact, imperfectly elaborated, and in having the imbrication retroverse instead of directed forwards; and the secondary papillae from which they spring are true hair papillas, differing only from ordi- nary hair papillae in being raised and grouped on a common pedicle instead of sunk in a proper follicle. In some cases the resemblance of these filaments to ordinary hair is very close indeed, as seen in Jig. 758. ; indeed in c Fig. 758. Ilalr-UUe processes offiliform papillcc. a, Mag. 150, 6 and c, 100 diameters. the chief difference is in the direction of the imbrication : in some morbid specimens I have seen it even closer. Now this difference in the arrangement of the epithelium on the different papilla? in- dicates, I think, a very important physiolo- gical distinction ; in one case we see the sen- tient papilla; covered by a thin layer of a fine epithelium, thinner over them than in the in- tervals between them ; in the other case we see each secondary papilla the seat of a rapid generation of epithelium that clothes the whole compound organ with a dense impene- trable brush of hairs : this latter arrangement seems as inconsistent with the possession of sensibility as the former seems adapted to it, and the difference would suggest to me the division of the papilla? into " sentient" and "protective ;" among the former I would class the circumvallate and the fungiform, among the latter the filiform and, with a certain qua- lification, the conical : but I shall return to this presently in speaking of the functions of these papilla?. The great difference between the filiform and conical forms is in the amount of the epithelium : in the filiform it is such as has just been described ; in the conical, the hairs are very short and thick, and terminate in an even plane almost as soon as they be- come separate, so that they have not at all a filamentary character. This epithelium is being constantly generated and as constantly thrown off* as is shown by the variation in the quantity of fur on the tongue from day to day. It is in these papilla? that the separation into two layers is best seen (Jig. 757. ef), and the appearances of this separation are such as to make me think that the method of desqua- mation is not by the shedding of individual scales, but by the throwing off of the upper layer, the under layer taking its place, itself to become divided into a deep-seated and su- perficial portion, and to be in turn thrown off as it grows older. The vascular supply of these papilla? is very abundant, as might be expected from the rapid nutrition that is taking place from their surface. The pigmentary character of the epithelium, at least under some circum- stances, has been already referred to. The simple papilla? are scattered beneath the apparently non-papillary surface behind the circumvallate, beneath the edges of the tongue, and on the under surface of its free portion, also among the conical and filiform ; in the former situation they resemble the secondary papilla? of the circumvallate and fungiform, in the epithelium being continued smoothly over them ; in the latter, those of the filiform, each being the base of a hair- like process. The situation of these pa- pilla?, their number and arrangement, is very well shown by injection, when the individual loops of capillaries may be seen passing up from the sub-mucous plexus at regular inter- vals, one to each papilla. The method in which the conical papilla? of the upper sur- face pass into the simple of the under, is this : — the ridges on the side of the tongue, to which reference has already been made, con- sist of fused conical papilla? arranged in linear series vertical to the edge, and, like them, crowned with secondary papilla? ; as they pass down the edge towards the under surface they become shallower, so that by the time they have reached that surface, the secondary pa- pilla?, instead of being elevated, are sessile, and immediately subtended by the cutis, This is the true nature of those vertical ridges on the edge of the tongue described by Bichat, Soemmering, and many other anatomists. Structure of papilla.— The nature of the true papillary structure, i. e. the contents of the projection of basement membrane, seemsTONGUE. 1140 to be partly fibrous, partly granular: cer- tainly something like yellow fibrous tissue can be detected, particularly on the addition of acetic acid; but those specimens that I have examined have appeared to be more granular than fibrous, and in some cases, where there has been a fortuitous rupture of the papilla, there has been an abundant escape of a finely granular material: the exact na- ture of this granular material I have not been able to ascertain ; it is not fatty. The me- thod of termination of vessels is sufficiently conspicuous, and has been already indicated. With regard to the termination of nerves I must confess, that, after long-continued and careful search, 1 have been unable to find any thing I can construe into a looped termina- tion. I have traced the nerve for some little way into the simple papilla, and then, its out- line becoming less and less definite, it has ceased to be visible, apparently from the loss of the strong refraction of the white substance of Schwann. If I might hazard an opinion, I should say that the axis was probably de- nuded of this investment, and, thus laid bare, underwent some specific peripheral modifi- cation. In a paper by Dr. Waller, recently published in the" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society," a method of nervous termination by open mouths is suggested : con- sidering the solid nature of the nerve-axis, this appears to be an opinion that requires either some modification, or the confirmation of re- peated and varied observations, before it can be received as certain. At present our means of examining the termination of nerves, either in the organs of sense or elsewhere, are im- perfect, and until they are less so we can hope to make but little advance in this, at present, obscure subject. Functions of the different papilla.—Three offices are to be discharged by the papillae — thev are to exercise the sense of taste, the sense of touch, and to form a suitable cloth- ing and protection to the tongue. The struc- ture of the circumvallate and fungiform pa- pillae, their shape, their position, the nature of their epithelium, all point them out as the organs that are to discharge the first-men- tioned function, and their nervous supply, which may be demonstrated with facility, makes that probability a certainty. To detail the evidence on which this conclusion is based would merely be to repeat what the reader will find given at length under the 'articles Fifth Nerve, Eighth Nerve, and Taste, to which I therefore refer him. By what pa- pillae,then, is the sense of touch exercised? I think by the conical, and by them in contradis- tinction to their non -gustatory congeners, the filiform. My reasons are, first, that the sense of touch is only possessed in any perfection by the papillae at the tip of the tongue.* Now * There can be no doubt about this fact; and it is what we might antecedently expect, because it is the most movable part, and therefore has the widest range of application; because it is the most capable of movement, and therefore the best adapted for that which is an essential condition of touch; these are conical and of the form the'most re- moved from the filiform type, that is, their epithelium is the least abundant of all the non- gustatory papilla;. Secondly, because the struc- ture of the filiform papillae is the most incompat- ible that could be devised for the possession of a sense of touch in any perfection. And, thirdly, because we do find, in fact, that the centre of the dorsum of the tongue, where the filiform papilla; exist in the greatest abundance, is the least sensitive part of any. Therefore, unless we assign the sense of touch to the gustatory papilla', which the lowness of its conditional the back of the tongue, where the gustatory papillae are so abundantly developed, seems to negative, we are driven to the conical as the only ones that can possess it. The filiform papillae remain for the third office — that of clothing and protecting the exposed dorsum of the tongue ; their pilose investment ad- mirably adapts them for this, and at the same time it imparts to the surface a certain pre- hensile power, enabling it to take hold of and move readily what is placed on it, while the backward direction of the hairs adds yet more a special facility for transmitting food towards the pharynx. Mucous glands.—These are largest and most abundant at the base of the tongue, where they occupy the space behind the circum- vallate papillae, and lie immediately beneath the surface, which they raise in nodular emi- nences. The most anterior of them form a V-shaped ridge, the counterpart of that formed by the circumvallate papillae, from which they are separated by a corresponding furrow. These structures, which are true mucous glands, analogous to the buccal and labial, are of an oval or roundish lenticular shape : in front of the epiglottis they are gradually lost. Each gland is surmounted by a distinct orifice, most conspicuous in the most posterior of them, opening into a little crypt, generally closed and collapsed, but dilatable so as to be large enough to contain a mustard-seed, and into the bottom of these crypts the minute ducts of the glands open. Some of these crypts I have found extending into long and capacious canals, branching in dif- ferent directions, and undermining the surface. I have traced some of them half or three- quarters of an inch before they have termi- nated in their blind extremities : their surface is quite smooth, and the orifices of the ducts of neighbouring glands might be seen termi- nating in different parts of it. They probably act as reservoirs, and permit some accumula- tion of the secretion, and also prevent the orifices of the glands from infarction by the matters passing over the surface. Similar glands, but smaller, are seen along the sides of the tongue, particularly near the base ; and under the tip a small aggregation of them, because we find it is the tip that we do apply to parts that we want to feel; because the tip is capa- ble of receiving a pointed form, and therefore loca- lising the impression more perfectly; and because the tip receives the most abundant supply of twigs from the fifth nerve.1141 TONGUE. 4 D 3 first described by Nuck, may generally be de- tected : they are about eight or ten in num- ber, much smaller than those at the base, situated on each side of the median furrow, and each surmounted by a little orifice. The true glandular nature of all these structures is proved by microscopical examination: they are seen to be true conglomerate glands, their ultimate follicles filled with an abundant se- creting epithelium. Vessels of the tongue. — The vascular supply of this organ, which is large in proportion to its size, is derived mainly from its proper ar- tery, the Ungual, but it receives some small branches at its sides and base from the inferior pharyngeal and palatine. The lingual artery arises from the external carotid, between the inferior thyroid and the facial : it passes up- wards and inwards, at first superficial, covered only by the integument and fasciae, to reach the posterior border of the hyoglossus muscle, beneath which it passes to its anterior border, where it breaks up into its terminal branches, the sublingual and the ratline. In the first part of its course it lies on the middle constrictor of the pharynx ; in the second part it is covered by the hyoglossus and mylohyoid muscles, and lies on the middle constrictor and genio- glossus. Previous to passing beneath the posterior border of the hyoglossus the artery is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, which, at first placed below it, now rises above it; the hyoglossus muscle then separates the two, the nerve lying outside of it and the artery beneath it, but at its anterior border they are again in relation ; the nerve, however, is now inferior, having crossed the course of the artery while beneath the hyoglossus. Its branches are, 1st, a hyoid branch, passing along the upper margin of the hyoid bone, corre- sponding to a branch of the superior thyroid running along the under margin of the bone, with which and with its fellow of the opposite side it anastomoses ; 2dly, the dorsalis Ungues branch, ascending from the artery in the se- cond part of its course, supplying the side and dorsum of the tongue ; 3dly, the sublingual, one of its two terminal branches, passing downwards and outwards from the anterior margin of the hyoglossus to be distributed to the sublingual gland, cellular tissue, and mu- cous membrane adjacent ; 4thly, the ranine, which may be regarded as its continuation, passing upwards and inwards in immediate relation with the genioglossus to the tip, where it anastomoses with its fellow. That the communication of the arteries of the opposite sides of the tongue is not very free, is shown by the imperfect injection of one side when the injection is made into the carotid of the opposite side : it is free enough, however, to make the ligature of the artery of one side of little service in stopping haemorrhage of that side, the supply from the other being sufficient to keep it up. Nerves of the tongue. — The tongue is sup- plied with nerves from three sources, two sentient—the lingual branch of the fifth, and the glosso-pharyngeal, and one motor — the ninth or hypoglossal nerve. The lingual or gus- tatory nerve, one of the three great branches into which the sensory portion of the inferior maxillary division of the fifth breaks up after its emergence through the foramen ovale, passes down, at first between the external pterygoid muscle and the small muscles of the palate, then between the two pterygoids, then between the internal pterygoids and the jaw, finally escaping from between these two at the anterior border of the muscle ; it then runs downwards and forwards, under the pro- tection of the jaw, to the side of the tongue, crosses the mylohyoid attachment of the superior constrictor, then passes forwards beneath the sublingual gland and to the outer side of the ranine artery, to terminate at the tip of the tongue. The numerous small branches that are distributed to the conical and fungiform papillae may be seen ascending from the nerve whilst beneath the tongue, passing upwards and forwards through the substance of the organ to the mucous surface. The other nerve of sensation, the glosso-pha- ryngeal, the smallest and most anterior di- vision of the eighth pair, emerges from the skull through the foramen lacerum jugulare by a distinct fibrous canal ; it then descends between the jugular vein and internal carotid, passing forwards, in front of that artery and beneath the styloid process and muscles aris- ing from it, to the anterior border of the stylo- pharyngeus, between that muscle and the styloglossus; it then passes under the hyo- glossus, beneath which and below the tonsil it divides into its branches for the supply of the gland and the tongue: its arch across the neck is below that of the lingual, and above the hypoglossal, but deeper seated than either. The branches to the tongue are distributed to the circumvallate papillae, and the mucous surface behind them. The ninth, or hypo- glossal nerve, the motor nerve of the tongue, after escaping from the skull through the an- terior condyloid foramen, lies at first deep, between the internal jugular vein and carotid artery; coming forward between them it be- comes superficial, and forms an arch across the neck below, and parallel to, the digastric muscle, hooks round the occipital artery, and passes beneath the mylohyoid muscle, but superficial to the hyoglossus, at the anterior border of which it pierces the fibres of the genioglossus, and divides into its branches for the supply of this and the other muscles of the tongue: its relations to the lingual artery have been mentioned. For a more detailed account of these nerves, of their relations, branches, and the experiments on the results of which the present amount of our knowledge as to their function is based, the reader is referred to the articles Fifth Nerve, Eighth Nerve, Ninth Nerve, and Taste. Comparative Anatomy. — The first in- dication that we find of any thing that can be construed into a tongue is met with in the Articulata, and, among them, in Insects. Its claim to the name is a matter of doubtTONGUE. 1142 among naturalists *; but since a certain oral appendage, at least in some of the orders, has received by common consent the name of lingua, I shall briefly describe it. The mouth of insects is furnished with two lips — an upper lip, or labrum, and a lower lip or labium; besides four jaws — a manuible,' or upper, and a maxilla, or lower jaw, on each side. The labium, or lower lip, is divisible into two parts — a men turn, or basal joint, and a more flexible piece moving on this, the ligula, or labium proper. On the inner sur- face of this labium is developed a small pro- cess having a certain resemblance to a tongue, situated in front of the oesophageal orifice, and generally anchylosed with the labium at the front and sides of that opening ; in some cases, however, as in the locusts and dragon- flics, it is free. This process Cuvier con- sidered merely as a part of the labium, and accordingly called it labium; Fabricius and Latreille gave it the name of ligula. In shape it is generally short, but in bees it is long; it is frequently simple, but in the wasp its apex is trifid, the same in Melolontha stigma; in Canabus it possesses three short teeth ; in Elaphras it terminates in a single tooth or point. In substance it generally approaches to a cartilaginous consistence, but in the Orthn- ptera and LibellulcB it is much more fleshy: and in the predaceous beetles it is as hard and horny as the integument. In some cases it is immovable, in others projectile and re- tractile within the mouth ; in some cases smooth, in others covered with hairs, as is the case in the common hive-bee; in Melo- lontha stigma the hairs are incurved In the hive-bee the upper part of the tongue is car- tilaginous, and remarkable for a number of transverse rings : below the middle it consists of a membrane longitudinally folded in in- action, but capable of being inflated to a con- siderable size : this membranous bag receives the honey which the tongue, as it were, laps from the flowers, and conveys it to the pharynx."f" Mollusca.— Gasteropoda. In the acephalous mollusca there is, of course, no tongue. But the Gasteropoda are provided with a very sin- gular apparatus, which, since it is usually called the tongue, cannot be allowed to pass obser- vation here, though its right to such an ap- pellation is somewhat questionable. Its form is subject to much variation, but it may be described generally as a thin membrane, long and narrow, the greater extent of which is rolled into a tube. This tubular part (Jig. 759. A, b), occupies the posterior portion of the membrane, the end being closed, while its an- terior extremity is open and in connection with the oesophagus ; in front of the tubular part of the tongue is a continuation of the same membrane, which is here flat, and in many * Ce qu'on a nomme langue dans les coleopteres et les orthopteres, ou l'extremite membraneuse de la levre infe'rieure, en me'rite & peine le nom.

B, single row of tongue-teeth of B. undatum. This membrane is covered on its upper sur- face with transverse rows of minute teeth, or rather plates with tubercular or tootlilike pro- cesses upon them. The number of rows is considerable, and very variable, the terrestrial species averaging, probably, about eighty, and the marine possessing often many more; the number of plates in each row is subject to still greater variation : the common whelk (Buccinum undatum) has but three (Jig. 759. B), the large garden slug (Limax maximus) has 180. The shape of the plates in terres- trial gasteropoda is usually irregularly qua- drangular, slightly longer than broad, while in some fluviatile and marine species they as- sume most complicated and elegant forms (Jig. 759. B). The centre plate of the row is always symmetrical, and its denticular projec- tions point in the direction of the closed end, i. e. backwards, and nearly horizontally. The plates on either side of this central plate usu- ally assume in terrestrial gasteropods much the same form and direction, while some of the fluviatile and most of the marine species present such an endless variety of forms, that the most that can be said of them, generally, is that the dental processes point backwards. Fig. 759. B represents a row of the denti- gerous tongue-plates of the Buccinum unda- tum : there are seen to be only three ; the cen- tral one symmetrical, the lateral ones of very different form, individually non-symmetrical, but having an exact correspondence to one another. The tongue itself (Jig. 759. A, 2) is attached, as before stated, to the oesophagus near its anterior extremity, and lies beneath it. In the Helices and Limaces it is enveloped in the muscular head of the gasteropod (Jig. 759. A, 1), its posterior blind end being just visible at the back part of the head, some dis- tance below the point where the oesophagus leaves that part and passes into the abdominal cavity. In the whelk tribe it lies beneath, and parallel to, the oesophagus, and is free, though surrounded by strong muscular bands, the general direction of which is also parallel to the tongue. It is in this tribe that the an- terior end of the tongue is curved downward,TONGUE. 1143 while its posterior extremity unlike terrestrial species, is furnished with a strong retractile muscle. In some other marine gasteropoda, as the limpet, a very small portion only of the tongue is included in the head, whilst the rest of it lies folded up in the abdominal cavity, between the intestines and the muscular foot, but perfectly free ; and in some cases it is nearly twice as long as the entire length of the animal. Of the uses of this curious apparatus it is difficult to speak with certainty. The short thick tube of the terrestrial gastcropods ap- pears adapted for the trituration of food pre- paratory to its passing into the oesophagus : these species arc furnished with a large, strong, horny plate, fixed in the mouth at the upper part of the head, and, consequently, the flat end of the tongue acts as an under jaw working against this horny plate. It is not easy, however, to imagine that the long nar- row tube of the whelk tribe can be used in the same way for triturating food, though the envelope of strong muscles would fa- vour that idea, while the consideration of the still longer and perfectly free tube of the limpet renders this use of the tongue among the marine gasteropoda still more improbable. It is well known that the Buccinum undatum and its allies use the flat- tened portion of the tongue as a file, with which they bore holes through the shells of other species and then feed upon them, and the muscular apparatus by which this is ef- fected is an admirable piece of mechanism. It consists of a protractor muscle, over the anterior extremity of which the curved por- tion of the tongue is flexed, which, by its self-elongation, probably by intrinsic trans- verse contraction, projects this recurved por- tion of the tongue from the mouth, and keeps it there; when the tongue is thus pro- truded, the retractor muscle, already alluded to, attached to its posterior blind extremity, contracts rhythmically, and so pulls the re- curved portion with a sawing motion over the extremity of the protractor muscle, which acts as a pulley for it: thus the teeth which cover the outer or free surface of this reflected portion are brought into the relation, with the objects on which they are to act, the most ad- vantageous for filing them away. But this gives us no clue to the determination of the manner in which the tubular part of the tongue is employed, nor am I aware of any probable conjecture having been advanced upon the subject. Professor Loven, of Stockholm, has pro- posed a system of classification of gasteropoda founded upon the forms of the tongue-plates and their arrangement; and it is probable that conchologists will find the suggestion a valu- able one, not so much for the sole foundation of an arrangement as for a check upon classi- fication on other bases.* * For much of the above detail I am indebted to Mr. Thomson, of King's. College, as well as for the specimens from which the drawings were made. Cephalopoda. Hitherto, in the insects among the Articulata, and the gasteropods among the Mollusca, we have only seen in the tongue an instrument for facilitating, mediately or immediately, the prehension of food : in the Cephalopoda we have the first structural indication of the sense of taste, and apparently in a perfection consistent with the high orga- nisation of the animal in other particulars. In both the ietrabranckiate and dibranchiate or- ders of cephalopods we meet with tongues of very similar structure, possessing in both an anterior and posterior soft papillose part, and an intermediate portion invested with a horny lamina, beset with rows of recurved spines. It is hardly possible to help seeing in this dis- tribution of parts the strong analogy it pre- sents to the mammalian tongue, in which the gustatory papillae are situated near the tip and base, while the centre of the dorsum is occu- pied by a rough indusium, subserving the same double office as the spiny lamina of the cephalopod, protecting the organ and facili- tating deglutition. In the Nautilus the tongue is supported by an oblong horny substance, probably analogous to the basis of the hyoid bone, free at its posterior extremity, but em- braced anteriorly by two retrahent muscles which arise from the posterior margins of the lower mandible. The anterior free extremity of the tongue itself is divided into three soft, fleshy, papillar caruncles, of which the central or anterior one is the largest. Behind them the surface is invested with a thin horny plate, on which are set four longitudinal rows of recurved spines, twelve in each row, each spine being about two lines in length. Be- hind this the tongue is again soft and sensory, but the papillae are coarser ; a fleshy fold pro- jects forward from each side of the fauces, likewise covered with papilla?. In the di- branchiate order the papillary structure is less perfectly developed, and the central horny lamina, instead of being in one plane, is bent at right angles into a vertical and horizontal portion, the incurved spines being set only on the vertical part. The rows of spines are seven throughout, but in the Onychoteuihis, as they descend towards the base of the [date, the outer rows merge in those next them to- wards the centre till there are only three rows. The method in which the cephalopods appro- priate their food, by tearing off piecemeal, by means of their strong and sharp mandibles, portions of the prey they have seized and are holding in contact with their mouth, renders the possession of the sense of taste of high importance to them, as the immediate contact of their food prevents their testing its nature by the sense of sight: at the same time, the full enjoyment of this sense is permitted by the nature of their food, its partially commi- nuted condition, and their protracted method of taking it. Vertebrata. — In the Invertebrata the defini- tion of a tongue depends, with few exceptions, on little more than locality and function — the requisitions of a tongue and the possession of an organ of any sort that fulfils those requi- 4 d 41144 TONGUE. sitions, constitute its possession, or any oral process, to which no other name can be assigned, is called a tongue. But when we enter the Vertebrata we find an organ of characteristic structure, conforming to a general type, pos- sessing many common characters, of a form whose varieties are not so great as to prevent its being the name of a particular shape, and always constituted of those three systems previously enumerated as essential to the tongue of Vertebrata. I shall first consider the comparative anatomy of the bony system of the tongue in all Vertebrata, and then briefly refer to some of the principal characters of the organ itself in the four classes into which that subkingdom is divided. Hyoid apparatus. — The comparative ana- tomy of the hyoid apparatus is a subject of high interest, as it enables us, by its reflected light, to read successfully the true nature and value of the different elements of the structure as met with in man and other mammalia. It shows us, with the certainty of a demonstra- tion, and the contrariety almost of a paradox, that the hyoid bone in man, which we are ac- customed to look upon as a single bone whose dismemberment depends merely on late ossi- fication, is, in reality, a composite structure — a contribution from two distinct systems of bones ; that while the body and lesser cornaa form part of the true endoskeleton, and are congeneric with the bony framework of the trunk and limbs, the greater corn.ua form part of the visceral or splanchnd-skeleton, and are congeneric with the maxilliform supports of the teeth of the stomach of the lobster, or the bony pieces situated in the auriculo-ventricular ring, in the hearts of ruminants, or with other similar structures ; and that, as we must look upon these in regard to the function they sub- serve, as respectively digestive and circulator?/ bones, so we must regard the greater cornua of the hyoid as respiratory. To prove the truth of this proposition, it will be necessary to examine the state of the hyoid apparatus in water-breathing animals, and to connect its condition as found in these with what we find it in air-breathers, by tra- cing the modifications which its different parts undergo in those animals, part of whose ex- istence is destined to the respiration of water, and part to that of air ; we shall thus gain a clear insight into their homologies, and be able to refer part to part without the chance of fallacy, inasmuch as the link of their con- nection is lodged not in different individuals, but in different parts of the life of one. I shall describe it, 1st., in fish. Professor Owen has shown that the different segments of the true hyoid arch are so many elements of the inverted or haemal arch of the third cranial vertebra. The centre of this arch in fishes ( fig. 760. A) is formed by four small, subcubical bones, the basi-hyals (b '//) (two only are represented in the figure, being seen in profile), from the sides of which extend upwards, backwards, and outwards, two long and stout cylindrical pieces, the cerato-hyals (c h) ; the summit of each of these is surmounted by a small trian- gular piece, the epi-hyal (ep li), and the arch thus constituted is suspended on each side, to the base of the skull, by a small, slender ossicle, the stylo-hyal (st li), which may be considered either as the entire proximal piece of the hyoid arch, or a dismemberment of that piece, according as the posterior division of the epitympanic, to which it is attached, is looked upon as the displaced proximal piece of the next arch in advance, the tym- pano-mandibular, or as itself the proximal element of the hyoid. This completes the hyoid arch: in most fishes, however, there are two more bones attached to the centre of the apparatus, one stiliform, projecting forwards, appended to the anterior surface of the median symphysis of the basi-hyals, the glosso-hyal (g h), the true lingual or tongue-bone; the other, the uro-hyal (u li), a vertically-expanded, triangular piece, extending backwards from the posterior surface of the basi-hyals. There are generally appended to the posterior and lateral surface of the cerato-hyals and epihyals a series of slender, slightly curved rays, varying in number from three to thirty, but generally about seven, as in the cod (Gadus Morrhua) (fig. 760. A) ; their office is to sup- port the membrane that covers in the branchial chamber, whence they are called branchio- stegals (b,b). Immediately behind the hyoidean arch, we meet with a system of arches, the branchial, whose office is to support the gills, and whose structure, position, development, and con- nections prove them to have no relation with the true skeleton : they are generally five in number; the four anterior being branchial, the last, which is dentigerous and guards the gullet, pharyngeal. Each arch rises laterally from a median chain of ossicles attached to the basi-hyal, or uro-hyal when ossified, and consists of a short inferior piece, the hypo- branchial, surmounted by a long, curved piece, the cerato-branchial, bending first outwards and upwards, then forwards and inwards, under the base of the cranium. Now, these arches are what were just now stated to be homologous with the posterior or greater cornua of the hyoid apparatus, in all vertebrate forms, whenever they exist; that they are so, will best be shown by tracing the modifica- tions they undergo in the metamorphoses of the anourous batrachians. Fig. 760. B, 1. re- presents the hyoid and branchial apparatus in the water-breathing tadpole; B, 2, where the same animal has become the air-breathing frog. In the full-gilled tadpole (B, 1), a simple basi-hyal (b h) supports laterally two cerato- hyals (c h), and posteriorly two short hypo- branchials (h b), to each of which are attached four cerato-branchials (c b). The second stage is marked by the divergence and growth of the extremities of the hypo-branchials and the pro- gressive absorption of the cerato-branchials. At the third stage, the cerato-branchials have disappeared, and the hypo-branchials have assumed the character of true greater hyoidean cornua (B, 2, h b). In the fourth stage they1145 TONGUE. Fie. 760. Comparative anatomy of the hyoid apparatus. (After Geoffroy and Owen.') A, Fish (Cod). B, Reptile (Frog: 1, tadpole; 2, adult). C, D, Bird (C, Crane; D, Woodpecker). E, Mammal (Horse). became ossified, and, together with the cerato- hyal, coalesce with the basi-hyal. As in their previous condition they subserved to respira- tion, so now they do the same — as they before supported the branchiae, so now they support the trachea and larynx : they may be always recognized by this relation, — the}' always embrace the commencement of the air-passages in their fork, being especially connected with the first segment of the carti- laginous framework of those passages, namely, the thyroid cartilage ; the universality of this relation has induced Professor Owen to name them, in air-breathing vertebrata, thyro-hyals (Jig. 760. C,D, B,kb,cb). In birds (Jig.760. C and D), the elements of the true hyoid arch are either rudimentary or suppressed, while the hypo- and ccrato- branchials (k b, c b) are enormously deve- loped. The basi-hyal (b h) is generally elongated proportionately to the shape of the tongue, and to its anterior extremity is usually attached a glosso-hyal (g h), to its posterior a stilif'orm uro-hyal (u //) which is prolonged be- neath the trachea. In C, which represents the hyoid apparatus of the crane (Grus cinerea), the glosso-hyal is seen to be wanting, and two rudimentary cerato-hyals (c h), lesser corrma, to be attached to the anterior extremity of the basi-hyal. In D is represented the hyoid apparatus of the woodpecker (Picus); the parts are seen to be very long and slender, furnishing the means for the lengthened pro- trusion of the tongue in pursuit of food. All the bones are seen to be linear; there is a long basi-hyal (b h), surmounted by an arrow- shaped glosso-hyal (g h), while two slender hypo-branchials (It b,) (greater cornita) areTONGUE. 114-6 surmounted by two cerato-branchials (c b) of extreme length and tenuity, which, curving round the bird's occiput and vertex, are inserted by their cartilaginous extremities into a canal in the upper mandible, the orifice of which is placed to the inside of the right nos- tril ; the true hyoid arch is here entirely sup- pressed. And, indeed, birds' tongues are not attacked, they are slung; now, tongues are attacked by the osseous or fibrous continuity of the hyoid arch ; they are slung by the loose, unattached hypo- and cerato-branchials ; and accordingly as either of these methods of con- nection with the body is most consistent with the tongue's functions, so the one or the other of these systems of bones preponde- rates. In mammalia we find the hyoid apparatus recurring in its original completeness ; the three pieces, the stylo-hyal, epi-hyal, and cerato-hyal, composing the lateral arms of the arch in the fish, have each their representa- tive : the proportion of these parts, the com- pleteness of their ossification, and their anchy- losis, or separateness one from another, are liable to great variety, but either in the bony or ligamentous condition, fused or separate, the parts may be always traced. The cerato- hyals are represented by the lesser cornua ; the stylo-hyals have their homologue in the sty- loid process of the temporal ; and the epi- hyal, or intervening portion of bone, is a cylin- drical ossicle connecting the two : these are seen in their greatest completeness in the true carnivora. In man the epi-hyal is not normally ossified, but remains in a permanently liga- mentous condition, as the stylo-hyoid liga- ment. In some rare instances, this ligament has been ossified, and then the typical condi- tion of the hyoid arch is restored ; two or three of these instances have been recorded and figured by Geoffrey. In Jig. 760. E is shown the condition of the hyoid apparatus in the horse ; the stylo-hyals are seen to be very large, and approximate so nearly to the cerato- hyals, that the intervening bone, corresponding to the stylo-hyoid ligament in man, is seen to be a mere pisiform nodule (ep k) ; the hypo- branchials, or posterior cornua (It b), are of much the same shape as in man, while the basi-hyal projects forwards in a rostrum, to which is attached a glosso-hyal in two pieces (g k). In the ox the condition is much the same as in the horse, but the epi-hyals are longer, and the stylo-hyals shorter. I will now briefly advert to the general characters of the tongue itself, as met with in the four classes of Vertebrata,—Pisces, Rep- tilia, Aves, and Mammalia. Pisces. — The tongue in fish is very rudi- mentary ; in some it cannot be said to exist at all; in others it is a thin, fleshy investment, that barely covers the glosso-hyal bone pro- jecting into the mouth. In the herring {C/upea Harengus), it seems to be represented by a small muscle passing along the floor of the mouth to be inserted into the symphysis of the lower jaw, to depress and open which seems to be its function. In the cod it is round and thick, and seems to act as a sort of cushion. In the conger (Murcena Conge?-), in which it is very large, it seems to possess a hyo-glossus muscle, which, arising from the inferior portion of the hyoid arch, passes for- ward on either side of the tongue, which, by the action of one of these muscles, can thus have a lateral deflexion imparted to it. The structure of the investments of the tongue is not such as to imply the possession of taste in any degree, or any thing but a very low sensi- bility. In some species, as, for instance, in the sole (Solea vulgaris), the surface is regularly rugose, and might, at first sight, appear to be papillary, but no true papillae are to be met with in any fish's tongue; their only repre- sentatives are the calcigerous processes, or teeth, with which the tongues of some species are more or less densely set, and which assist in prehension and deglutition. Whether the vascular, erectile tissue, situated on the palate of the Cyprinoids, has any connection with the sense of taste, is doubtful — probably not. Reptilia. — The tongues of Reptilia possess a very wide diversity ; some are immovable, others the most remarkable for their protrac- ti 1 itv that we find in any organism; some are long, some so short as to have been described as wanting; some are broad and thick, some slender; some present the development of papillae in great perfection, some are quite smooth; the extremes of all these charac- ters we find in the reptiles, and their oppo- site conditions in those the most closely allied. For example, among the Saurians, the tongue of the crocodile is so immovable, as to have been described by Aristotle as want- ing; while the chameleon presents us with the most complete protractility of the organ that the animal kingdom furnishes. I think the teleologists have not a greater strong hold than that furnished them by the tongues of reptilia. Almost the only thing in common that can be assigned to them is this, that pre- hension is their principal function, and that the sense of taste is very subordinate. a. Batrachia.—All the Batrachia, in their perfect state, feed on living prey*, and in many of them the arrangement of the tongue, to enable them to secure it, is remarkably curious. In the frog, which presents a good example, we see the tongue reversed, as it were, the base or attached end being in front, the apex or free extremity behind : its mus- cular constitution explains this arrangement. It consists essentially of two muscles, a genio- glossus and hyo-glossus, invested by the mucous membrane. The genio-glossus arises from the inferior maxillary symphysis, and, directed backwards towards the throat, spreads out, and, together with its fellow, constitutes the upper of the two muscular strata. The hyoglossi arise from the lower surface of the posterior hyoid cornua, are directed forwards * In speaking of the frog Roesel says, " Pradam vix venatur eamdem potius prsestolans, nec ullimi unquam devorabit insectum motu destitutum." Hist. Eanar., p. 16.1147 TONGUE. under the flattened cartilaginous plate of the body of the hyoid bone, over the anterior bor- der of which they are reflected as over a pul- ley, where, coming in contact with the under surface of the last-mentioned muscles, they curve backwards, radiate in a fan-like manner, and form the under of the two muscular layers. This is the position in a state of rest, the hyo- glossus lying under the genioglossus, and the extremity of the tongue pointing down the throat in contact with the fauces, and forming a plug with which to close the posterior nares, and prevent the regress of air every time it is swallowed. But when the animal would seize its prey, the position of the tongue is sud- denly reversed; the genioglossus contracts, and moving on its genial attachment as on a centre, the tongue is thrown forwards, the ge- nioglossus now being below, the hyoglossus above. The apex of the tongue having come in contact with the prey to be seized, and se- cured it by its viscid secretion, the organ is instantly retracted and restored to its original position by the contraction of the hyoglossus. In many of the batrachians (as in the Triton) the tongue is fixed in its entire extent, and is of very various shapes, oblong, rhomboidal, heart-shaped, &c, affording generic and spe- cific distinctions, of which zoologists have availed themselves in classification. The tongues of Batrachia are invariably soft, and, in some of them, as the frog, covered with well-developed papillae, containing all the es- sential elements of organs of taste and touch ; that they are the seat of an acute sense of taste is, however, highly improbable, not from any thing in their structure, but from the fact that these animals swallow their prey whole, without any subdivision, frequently alive, bolt- ing it as soon as seized. b. Ophidia.—In the ophidians the tongue is very much elongated, straight, flat or cylin- drical, fleshy, highly protractile, and deeply cleft at the apex into two tapering points which are in a state of constant vibration when the tongue is protruded. These points are the extremities of two muscular cylinders, which form the substance of the tongue, and by their close apposition constitute that part of it that seems to be undivided : they may be traced a long way down in front of the tra- chea. When the mouth is opened the tongue very frequently cannot be seen, from its being drawn within a sheath which contains it, the orifice of which is placed in front of the aper- ture of the glottis. From this sheath, and from the mouth, it is being constantly pro- jected, with a sort of vibratile darting move- ment, and, from a deficiency in the plates at the symphysis of the jaws, it can be protruded from the mouth without the jaws being sepa- rated : the character of this movement, and the pointed slender shape of the tongue, have given rise to the vulgar belief that it is the animal's weapon of offence, a sort of dart con- taining the poison that it instils into the wounds it inflicts. From the nature of the food of this order, from the disposition of the parts of the mouth, and from the short so- journ that the food makes in it, the perception of savours is probably very slight. c. Chelonia.—In Chelonia the tongue is not elongable, and its muscular structure is very simple, consisting only of two pair of muscles, the genioglossus and hyoglossus. In the tur- tles the surface is smooth ; in most of the tortoises it is clothed with very large and well- developed papilla;, long, soft, and flexible, arranged with great regularity in a close pile: the structure of these papillae, together with the masticatory apparatus possessed by these animals, woidd imply their possession of a true sense of taste. d. Sauria.—Among the saurians we find in the Crocodile a fixed tongue projecting so little from the floor of the mouth, that Aris- totle, as has been stated, described it as want- ing; it is covered with a coriaceous integu- ment, and is remarkable chiefly for a valve-like process at its base, formed by a reduplication of the integument over the vertical ridge of the body of the hyoid bone, which, at the will of the animal, is capable of being applied to a similar one descending from the palate, and shutting off the mouth from the posterior nares and larynx, so that the animal can breathe when its mouth is under the water or engaged with its prey, and its nostrils only above the surface. In the Lizard we find a tongue, in shape very much like that of the Ophidians. In the Chameleon we find an apparatus which, for its remarkable structure and powers, has always excited the attention and curiosity of zootomisls : Perrault, Hunter, Cuvier, Vallis- nieri, Vrolick, Houston, Milne Edwards, Spittal, Duvernoy, have all given their con- tributions to the subject; the connection of the mechanism with the resulting phenomena, as given by these authors, has been very di- verse, and all, in the opinion of Bibron, un- satisfactory. " It is easy," says this author*, " to conceive and explain a part of these movements, by the structure of this tongue in the chameleons, because the hyoid bone and the muscles have been perfectly described, and because it is easy to isolate them by dis- section ; yet, by the very aid of this anatomy we perceive that the movements which this mechanism should effect would not suffice for the production of such an excessive elongation, that the animal, without using any violent exer- tion, can lance from its mouth, by a sort of ex- piation, a fleshy pipe of a length nearly equal to that of its whole trunk,and that it can retract it again within its throat with the same swiftness, and without one's perceiving any apparent movement in the rest of its body." The dif- ficulty that Bibron felt was that of accounting for the very great intrinsic elongation of the tongue, and it appears to me to be a difficulty that exists; various authors account for it variously; in my own dissections I have not met clear evidence of anything that satisfac- torily explains it to me. I shall first describe the tongue itself, and then the hyoidean appa- * Erpe'tologie Ge'ne'rale, ou Histoire Naturelle complete des Reptiles, Paris, 1836, t. iii. p. 174.TONGUE, 1148 mouth, it is seen to be a whitish, fleshy, ru- ratus and muscles, and from the description of the two deduce the most probable explanation of the movements. When a portion of the integument and lower jaw on one side is removed, so as to expose the tongue when retracted within the gous mass, about an inch and a half long, fill- ing the buccal cavity, so as to depress the floor of the mouth and throat, in shape some- thing of a cone with the base in front: the posterior half, or smaller part, is seen to be thrown into deep and numerous transverse rugae (Jig. 761.

C, seen from beneath, hi situ, by incision and separation of the integument. quite up to the hyoid bone, and give to this part the appearance of an earth-worm, a simile suggested by Belon. When the tongue is drawn out it is seen to be capable of great extension (B), the extension taking place in the posterior or rugose portion, and being effected by the obliteration of the transverse ruga?, which one by one are smoothed or flattened out as the extension is continued, so that when it is stretched as far as it will go by moderate traction, the tongue, instead of being an inch and a half long, of which only half is occupied by the extensible portion, is five inches long, the extensible part occupying about six-sevenths of the entire extent, and being much attenuated (B, b), while the an- terior portion retains its original size and shape (a). The tongue is thus seen to be composed of two parts, a club-shaped ex- tremity and a highly extensible medium of connection between this extremity and the hyoid bone : these two parts I shall now describe. The anterior club-shaped extremity is about three quarters of an inch long, and three lines in diameter, and in shape reminds one of the corolla of a labiate flower ; in fact it is bilabi- ate: it has a sort of dome above (a), termi- nated in front by an upper lip (c), which is opposed by a more projecting lower lip (d), and between them is situated a funnel-shaped mouth, which, when closed, as in A, forms a horizontal cleft, but is capable of being opened as shown in B, (and to an extent greater than that represented in the figure,) and closed on any object at the will of the animal, so as to assist in the prehension of food. These lips are furnished with a sort of orbicularis, and, no doubt, too, with muscles that shall raise the upper and depress the lower ; but I have been unable to detect any fibres going in such a direction as to produce these movements. This part, as well as the whole of the tongue, is invested with the mucous membrane of the mouth, and the upper surface of the dome and lower lip, are covered with minute papilla?, invested with a fine epithelium, and disposed, in the former situation, in rows, indicated by the lines (A, a). The part which covers in the infundibular cavity, and which, after the analogous part in a labiate flower, I have called the dome, Bibron has not ill compared to a tongue reversed. The second portion consists essentially of a membranous tube, threaded, as it were, by the long cartilaginous stilet, or tongue bone, of the hyoid apparatus (the glosso-lu/al). This cartilaginous stilet, which has been errone- ously described as bony, is about an inch and a half long, and consequently passes through the entire length of the tongue when re- tracted, its anterior extremity being received into the lower lip of the club-shaped portion : it threads the tongue much in the same way as a bodkin threads a bag when furnishing it with a running string, and it is by the pucker- ing of the membranous portion upon this basis that the transverse ruga; are formed. The membranous tube itself (which has been compared to a pipe, a piece of intestine, a1149 TONGUE. worm, &c.) is very complex in its structure : it consists, first, of an investment of mucous membrane, very thin and extensible, covered, apparently, by a single layer of epithelium, and a good deal of bluish-grey pigment, and underlaid by fibrous tissue disposed at right angles, transversely and longitudinally. When the sheath, thus composed, is cut open, it is seen to contain another fibrous sheath, smooth, dense, white, and shining, the proper sheath of the stilet, which it closely invests, and which smoothly glides in it. Between these two sheaths is a cavity which is occupied, first, by a longitudinal muscle on each side (essentially a hyoglossus), a very fine and slender fascicle, which runs the entire length of the tongue, and retracts it when protruded ; secondly, by a nerve on each side, disposed, when the tongue is retracted, in regular sinuosities, and, when drawn out, about five inches long ; it does not appear to give oft'any branches to the muscle, and does not diminish in size as it advances, so that it is probably distributed to the extremity, and is sensitive ; thirdly, by some cellular tissue loosely connecting the mucous investment with the fibrous sheath of the stilet; fourthly, no doubt, arteries and veins. The proper sheath of the stilet does not contain a canal, but is attached to the surface of the stilet, which glides in it not by its movement on the sheath, but by the move- ment of the parts of the sheath on itself. When the stilet is retracted it is seen to be cylindrical throughout, but as it advances its sheath accumulates on its anterior extremity, and it seems gradually to become club-shaped, so that when the tongue is completely re- tracted the under lip is filled not only with the extremity of the stilet, but with the sheath accumulated on it. Cuvier has described an annular muscle existing throughout the entire length of the membranous portion, which he describes as the proper muscle of the tongue, and to which he attributes its self-elongation. If such a muscle exists, which I will not posi- tively deny, it would fulfil all the required conditions, and leave nothing to be explained ; but I confess that, after careful microscopical research, I have been unable to find any mus- cular fibres having a transverse or circular dis- position, all being referable to the longitudinal bundles already referred to. Hunter has de- scribed what he considered to be two coils of some firm substance, wound in opposite di- rections, which by their approximation would become straightened, and so lengthen the tongue ;•—this is an ingenious hypothesis, but no more : there is nothing that will bear such an interpretation. Perrault, in speaking of the lungs of chameleons*, expresses an opi- nion that the tongue is driven, or, as it were, coughed out by the sudden expulsion of the air which the lungs contain. The hyoid apparatus consists of the hori- zontal projecting portion — the stilet already referred to, and four cornua, two short ante- rior ones, and two long vertical posterior ones {Jig. 761. A and B). These parts can move * Essais de Physique, t. i ii freely on each other, the articulation between the stilet and the greater cornua is particularly free. These cornua ascend, and are suspended loosely behind the jaws ; they are about three quarters of an inch long, and are clothed with the muscles that are attached to them. These muscles are, 1st, the geniohyoid (e. A B and 6'.), arising from the inner surface of the symphysis menti in contact with its fellow, and inserted into the inferior extremity of the vertical cornua, sending up a slip which is attached to its whole anterior border. 2dly, a distinct, small fasciculus, the cerato-maxillary (/), arising from the inner surface of the lower jaw, and inserted into the apex of the vertical cornua. 3dly, the sternohyoid (g), arising from the inner surface of the sternal extremity of the fourth and fifth rib, and inserted into the junction of the cornua and glossal portion of the hyoid. 4-thly, the cerato-sternal (//), more slender and flattened than the last, the antagonist of the cerato-maxillary, arising from the outer surface of the sternal extremity of the second rib, and inserted, just opposite the cerato-maxillary, into the apex of the greater cornua. 5thly, the omo-hyoid (J), inserted with the sterno-hyoid. This complicated arrange- ment of muscles, which I have drawn from na- ture* in Jig. 761. A, is the mechanism for the direction and extrinsic propulsion of the tongue ; by it the lower extremities of the greater cornua are drawn forward, and the summits depressed, so that, instead of being vertical, they are horizontal and advanced (B). The advance of the whole tongue thus gained is nearly an inch, and since the muscles that principally effect it, the genio-hyoid (e), are very strong, and the movement quick and forcible, the question may arise—Is this projectile movement suf- ficient to send the rest of the tongue forward, and effect its elongation, after the hyoid ap- paratus has come to a stop, in the same manner as the arrow flies from the string of a bow, though the string itself is suddenly arrested ? I think not. I think that some such muscular arrangement as that described by Cuvier must exist; and possibly, some transverse bundles of fibres of not very cha- racteristic appearance, which, from the absence of transverse stria?, I rejected as muscle, might have been of a muscular nature. The retrac- tion of the tongue is easily accounted for; it is simply drawn back on the stilet by the lon- gitudinal muscles. The use of the stilet appears to be, partly as a support to the tongue when in a state of rest, and partly to direct its move- ments ; for aim is seen to be taken while the tongue is still retracted : the animal first places itself in such a position that its head shall be turned directly to the object to be seized; it then fixes its head still more accurately, then slowly opens its mouth to a sufficient distance to allow the free egress of the tongue ; it then seems to fix it with a sort of tremulous rigid * It may be well to state that not only these, but all the figures illustrating this article (with one or two exceptions, which I have acknowledged), are original, and have been drawn by myself from na- ture, so that I can vouch for their correctness.TONGUE. 1150 movement, and, in an instant, the tongue has apparently insufficient reason, the analogue been shot out, has again disappeared, and of the genio hyoid, arises from the inner with it its prey has disappeared too, the whole being performed with a velocity that startles one afresh every time it is witnessed. Aves.—The tongue of birds may be stated, in general, to be, like that of reptiles, prehensile and non-gustatory. Taste and mastication, i or, at any rate, taste and some delay of the food in the mouth, always go together ; in birds the food experiences no delay in the mouth, but, in almost all cases, is bolted at once. In most instances, true prehension, or the seizing of the food, is performed by the bill, in some few by the tongue ; in nearly all, however, the seem ing of it when in the mouth is effected by the tongue, which is armed near the base with numerous spines, directed back- wards (Jig. 763. A B D ), that prevent the regress of the prey, whether alive or dead, and which, with a similar structure at the roof of mouth and throat, must greatly assist the first stage of deglutition. The structure of the tongue of birds is generally such as not to aamit of intrinsic elongation ; its protrusion therefore can only be effected by the move- ment of the organ en masse ; and this is pro- duced to a surprising extent by a particular arrangement of the hyoid bone and its muscles, which I will now describe. The general cha- racter of the hyoid bone of birds, as already stated, is elongation — longitudinal extension, and to this add the fact of the suppression, entire or partial, of osseous or ligamentous attachment of the hyoid elements to the skull, such attachment being inconsistent with the required free movements of the organ. From the posterior part of the body of the hyoid bone project back the slender posterior cor- nua forming, by their divergence, an acute angle, embracing in its apex the upper part of the larynx : as they pass beneath the occiput they curve upwards, and are surmounted by slender pieces, frequently cartilaginous (ceralo- hranckial), having a still greater curvature; so that the whole greater cornua, as thus consti- tuted, embrace the back of the skull, to t he y\.-«%,--"''] shape of which their curve is moulded, and on which they are made to glide backwards and forwards by the muscles that regulate the protrusion and retraction of the tongue. The principal of these muscles are two pair ; the first the analogue of the stylo hyoid, which retracts the tongue, and the second pair which Cuvier has called the analogue of the genio hyoid — the conical muscle of Vicq d'Azyr, — which draws the tongue forwards : the obliquity and length of these muscles, and the free unattached suspension of the hyoid apparatus, render the movements of the tongue very free, and their range exten- sive. The retrahent muscle, the stylo-hyoid (fig- 762. a.), arises from the posterior part of the lower jaw, and passes forward to be in- serted into the upper surface of the junction of the cornua and body of the hyoid : in some birds it is more voluminous than in the species figured, and has a more extended insertion ; it retracts the tongue. The pro- trusor ( b), which Cuvier has named, with Fig. 762. Muscles of the Tongue of the Fieldfare (Tardus pilaris), a, retractor; b, protrusor; c, cerato-glossal. side of the lower mandible, passes downwards and a little backwards to the posterior cor- nua, which it embraces in its fibres from the point where it comes in contact with it to its extremity : the fibres become increasingly oblique as they pass back, and embrace the cornua in a muscular cone, which, by its con- traction, causes the cornua to slide forwards in it, and so protrude the tongue . in the wood- pecker, in which the hyoid cornua pass com- pletely round the head and into the upper mandible, this muscle is of proportionate length. Besides these, there is a mylo hyoid, a thin layer passing from the lower mandible to a median fibrous line, and a cerato-hyoid pass- ing from the posterior cornua to the uro-hyal, approximating these, and so directing the apex of the tongue to the opposite side. Fig. 762. c. is a small muscle, which I cannot find de- scribed ; it passes from the under surface of the basi- or glosso-hyal to the greater cornua, into which it is inserted within the sheath of the conical muscle. I would suggest the name of cerato glossal for it ; its action is to in- crease the curvature of the cornua, and there- by draw the tongue back. Fig. 763. represents some different forms ofJ151 TONGUE. the tongue in birds. A, is that of, the snipe (Scollopax gaUinago), which is seen to be linear; 13, of the fieldfare (Turdus pilaris), the epithelium breaking up into a leash of filaments at its extremity ; C, that of the king-fisher (Al- cedo ispida), so short that it hardly projects from the surface at the bottom of its long bill ; D, is the tongue of the common goose, furnished with a linear series of spines on each side, forming a serrate margin, which, with a corre- sponding serration in the upper mandible, con- stitutes a sort of sieve, through which the bird sifts and strains, as it were, the mud and water which it palpates in search of food. In the back part of the tongue, both in this and in the other figures, there is seen to be a peculiar armature of recurved spines, whose arrange- ment in the different species is constant and characteristic. Some good representations of different varieties of tongues are given in the article Aves. Mammalia.—The tongue of mammals differs not in any material point from that of man. The proportion of the different parts of its muscular structure differ more or less widely from the human type, and we find certain muscles that have no place in the tongue of man: to enter into the minutiae of these diver- sities woidd not, however, comport with the scope of the present article ; they must be soughtin monographs especially devoted to this part of the subject. The coincidence of the size and form of the tongue with that of the inferior maxillary arch is very general ; in the rodents this is very conspicuous, the tongue being of the same wedge shape as their cuneiform jaw. In some animals, as in the ant-eater and giraffe, the tongue admits of great elongation, and becomes an important organ of prehension. The different elements of the tegumental-)' sys- tem are merely modifications of those found in man : the three orders of papillae are gene- rally sufficiently conspicuous, and in most in- stances they are more regularly arranged, and their structure is more typical than in the human subject; for instance, the circumvallate papillae are symmetrical, they present a greater contrast to the rest in number, being fewer than in man, and none of the fungiform ap- proach them in form ; the shape of the fungi- form too is not liable to any variety, and they are implanted with great regularity among the conical. The conical papillae are generally true cones, and are arranged with mathemati- cal precision in lines in different directions, accordingly as they are viewed. All these papillae may be well seen in the dog. In the /elides the conical papillae of the centre of the dorsum are converted into recurved spines of great size and strength, which the animal uses in scraping the meat from the bones when feeding, and in combing its fur. Functions of the Tongue.— The phy- siology of the tongue, like its organisation, is double, all its functions being referable either to those sensory or muscular endow- ments which it possesses in so remarkable a degree. Naturally, these are intimately associated, its sensibility being necessary for the direction of its muscular action, and its movements necessary for the perfection of its sensibility; a systematic consideration of them, however, necessitates their separation, and those functions that are referable to the tongue as an organ of sensibility, have already been treated of in the articles Taste and Touch, to which the reader is referred ; it only remains for me to consider those that it possesses as an organ of motion. These are prehension, mastication, insalira- tion, deglutition, speech, and one or two unim- portant and non-essential offices in which it is engaged, which may be called the accidents of its physiology, as despuition or spitting, whistling, &c. Of these the four first-men- tioned belong to the tongue as an organ of digestion ; they are, in fact, the first four stages of that process; all four exist in all mammalia, the first and the last in all vertebrata ; speech and the other non-digestive motor functions are peculiar to man. Prehension. — The tongue is not, properly speaking, in man, an organ for the prehension of solid food, that office being performed by the hand, for which the opponent arrange- ment of thumb anil fingers eminently fits it, so that the human tongue has not those ad- ditional qualifications which we find in other animals to adapt it for an organ of pre- hension. And this, I may remark, is an in- stance of a very general law—that the ascent in the animal scale is not a passage from animals with simple organs to animals with complex organs, but from simple individuals with organs of complex function, to complex individuals with organs of simple function, the addition as we ascend being, not of functions, but of parts to discharge those functions, and the advantage gained, not another thing done, but the same thing done better. Thus in man, instead of having one office more, the tongue has one office less than in many animals below him ; and the delicate and extended prehen- sion supplied by his hands, diminishes by one item the complexity of function, and, there- fore, of organisation of his tongue. So that in judging of the elevation of animals by their individual organs, supposing such a method to be admissible, we must not look to complex- ity of structure of those organs, but to the perfection of the resulting function. But to return. In the prehension of liquids, or suction, the tongue in man is engaged; constituting a movable wall of the oral cavity, it acts as a piston, and draws the liquid into the mouth by the formation of a temporary vacuum. Bichat enumerates three methods of the pre- hension of liquids, by suction, by drinking from a vessel, and by infusion into the throat; in the first two the tongue is concerned ; in the last, which seems to me hardly to deserve the name of prehension, it is not. In suction, w hich is peculiar to the infant, the nipple is seized by the lips, which are compressed around it by the orbicularis oris; the velum palati is elevated so as to close the posterior nares; the tongue forms, by the contractionTONGUE. 1152 of the middle fibres of the genio-glossus, which depress its centre, a longitudinal channel, which receives the nipple, and transmits the milk to the pharynx as long as a vacuum con- tinues to be formed. In drinking liquids from a vessel the tongue forms a channel for its transmission, but it flows down to the pharynx by its own proper gravity. Mastication.—As far as relates to the tongue, which here, however, is only subsidiary to the teeth, the mechanism of mastication may be divided into three stages:—first, that of placing the food in an advantageous position with regard to the teeth; secondly, affecting the position of the food in a definite manner when under the action of the teeth; thirdly, collecting the scattered portions of masticated aliment prior to deglutition. Immediately on the introduction of a morsel of food into the mouth, either bitten by the incisors or other- wise, it is at once transferred to the molars, so that it shall project beyond them, outwards, against the cheek ; the cheek is then pushed against it by the action of the buccinator, and the food is slowly driven across the teeth, which are rhythmically opened and closed, the tongue at the same time pushing moderately against it on the inside and so regulating the movement imparted to it by the cheek. Thus we see that the food under mastication is sub- jected to an equable and regulated motion ; that it is placed, as it were, between two movable walls, and that by the even lateral movements of these walls, and the rhythmical vertical action of the teeth, its perfect masti- cation is secured. As soon as the cheek has pushed it inwards as far as it can, an interval in the rhythmical closure of the teeth takes place, and the tongue restores it to its former position, again to be pushed inwards, and so on. The equable mastication of the food is secured much in the same way as the even motion of a rod of timber, under the blade of a circular saw, secures the cutting oft' of pieces of equal thickness. Any one who watches himself whilst eating will at once observe the sets of rhythmical action, interrupted by short interval, in which the food is restored to its necessary position between the teeth. The third stage, that of collecting the food from all parts of the mouth, admits of no particular description. Insalivation.—There is no separate or super- added process for insalivation; it proceeds con- temporaneously with mastication, the motions which are necessary for the one supplying equally the required conditions of the other ; while the food is being comminuted by the teeth, dispersed by their action to different parts of the mouth, recollected by the tongue to be again dispersed, and so on, the salivary secretion is freely mixed with it, and reduces it to a homogeneous pulp : thus mastication facilitates insalivation by breaking up the food, and insalivation facilitates mastication by softening it. As one set of acts performs the two processes, of course there are not any additional movements of the tongue to describe. Deglutition.—When the food has attained a sufficient moisture and softness, which is ap- preciated by the tongue's sense of touch, it is collected into a mass, and the process of deglutition commences. Physiologists have divided this process, and the division is a good one, into three stages, which may be distin- guished respectively as the oral, the pharyngeal, and the oesophageal: the first conducts it past the anterior pillars of the fauces, the second in- cludes its transmission from that point through the pharynx into the oesophagus, and the third commences with its arrival at the oeso- phagus, and terminates with its entrance into the stomach. The first is entirely voluntary; the second is of a mixed nature, engaging partly voluntary and partly involuntary muscles, and, though practicable at will, is yet impres- sible on the transference to the back part of the tongue of the material to be swallowed ; the third is wholly involuntary. With the two first alone the tongue is engaged, and, there- fore, of these alone I shall speak. The first stage is merely the reference of the ball of alimentary matter to a point on the back of the tongue, posterior to the anterior pillars of the fauces. This is effected by the pressure of the tongue against the palate, whereby the food is forced back between the two. The second stage is a much more complex process, involving a more varied mechanism, and engaging in it different parts, the tongue, the pillars of the fauces, the soft palate, the larynx, and all the muscles of the pharynx. As soon as the food has passed the anterior palatine arch, that arch contracts, and by its constriction entirely prevents the regression of the food into the mouth ; at the same time the base of the tongue, and with it the food, is carried further back, and a second closure takes place from the approximation of the posterior pillars of the fauces, produced by the contraction of the palatopharyngeal muscles that form them: this part of the mechanism requires a little explanation. The contraction of the anterior pillars of the fauces closes the entrance into the mouth by a constriction or sphincter-like action: this is due to the general circular form of the constrictor isthmi fau- cium occasioned by the inward curvature of the upper and lower extremities of each palato- glossus muscle. The contraction of the palato- pharyngei is not of this nature; they have not the same inward curvature above and below, and their inferior attachments to the pos- terior borders of the thyroid cartilage are capable of very little approximation ; when, therefore, they contract, the soft palate being fixed, they approach one another laterally like two curtains, leaving a narrow chink in the middle, wider below than above. As soon as the food has passed this point, this contraction takes place, so that the two muscles of the opposite sides almost touch, the chink between them being occupied bv the relaxed uvula; the passage into the posterior nares and upper part of the pharynx is thus cut off, which has induced Dzondi to call the posterior palatineTONGUE. 1153 arch the velum palati posterius. At the same time that this is taking place, the base of the tongue is thrown back upon the epiglottis*,the larynx being drawn upwards and forwards to meet it, so that the rima glottidis is com- pletely closed, and the food glides safely down, over the inclined plane thus formed, into the pharynx raised and dilated to receive it : the food then comes within the grip of the constrictors of the pharynx, which successively pass it downwards to the oesophagus. This process takes place so rapidly that it is difficult to trace its parts in succession, and indeed some of them, which apparently succeed one another, are in reality contemporaneous : thus, the first stage — the raising of the dorsum of the tongue to the palate — is that which mainly contributes to the inclined plane of the second stage; and the raising and carrying forwards of the larynx under the tongue is that which principally dilates the pharynx.f The third stage, or the oesophageal, conducts the food to the stomach ; it is of that peri- staltic or vermicular nature that characterises all the succeeding movements of the alimentary canal; the muscles concerned are entirely involuntary, and the nature of the act purely reflex. The tongue is not concerned in it. Speech. — The tongue is the instrument principally engaged in those modifications of the oral passages which give rise to articulate sounds, which, definitely grouped and com- bined by man, and taken as the representa- tives of certain objects, actions, qualities, and relations, constitute Language. The con- sideration of this interesting subject, however, will more appropriately fall under the article Voice, to which the reader is referred. Morbid Anatomy or the Tongue. — The tongue is obnoxious to a variety of morbid changes, which might naturally be expected from the number and nature of the elementary tissues which enter into its formation, as well as from the diversity of the functions it has to perform, and the exposure to injury in which it is placed;— changes which may consist either in some increase, decrease, or disproportion of its normal ele- ments, in some lesion or morbid change in those elements, or else in the superaddition of some adventitious growth. The tongue may be affected with inflam- mation, hypertrophy, atrophy, induration ; with ulceration, numerous morbid changes in the conditions of the papillae ; with tumours, cancer, aphtha.' ; and the organ, moreover, is subject to be displaced, — there is prolapsus of the tongue, the tongue may be inverted * It would seem that the epiglottis is not abso- lutely necessary for the protection of the rima glot- tidis, but that the pressure of the base of the tongue over it is sufficient; as there are authentic cases on record, in which the epiglottis was quite destroyed by syphilis, and yet deglutition was never attended witli any inconvenience. t For a detailed account of this process, see Dzondi, die Functionen des weichea Gaumens. Halle, 1831. VOL. IV. and embraced by the pharynx — swallowed; and the tongue may be unnaturally fixed by an unusual extent of frenum, the individual thus circumstanced being tongue-lied. Inflammation of the tongue. — The morbid changes caused by inflammation of the tongue are modified by the structure of the organ. There is one form of this disease in which, from the extreme vascularity of the tongue and the distensibility of its covering, it swells to an enormous size with great rapidity, and subsequently recedes without suppuration: this I have ventured to call erectile. In other cases the tongue suppurates. The constitu- tional action of mercury is another cause of glossitis. I therefore divide glossitis, for its more complete consideration, into — I. Idio- pathic (1. Suppurative; 2. Erectile); and II. Mercurial. Suppurative glossitis. — This is an extremely uncommon affection. It commences with heat, swelling, induration, and some fever; matter presents itself at various lengths of time, forming a more or less circumscribed abscess. It generally occurs on one side, and points just beneath the edge of the tongue. According to Dr. Moller, of Zealand, scrofu- lous persons are most liable to this affection. Instances are recorded by Mr. A. Smee, Dr. Graves, Dr. Moller, and one example occurred in the practice of the author's father. This latter patient was a lady, recovering from an attack of influenza. Her tongue, which was affected principally on one side, became swollen, tender, hard, stiff', and incapable of movement. She could not speak, and swal- lowed with great difficulty. At length the pus was evacuated, and the tongue healed, and recovered all its functions immediately. This lady now possesses a remarkably good use of the organ. Erectile glossitis. — This malady, though less rare than the preceding, is still quite un- common. The morbid condition of the tongue in this disease appears to consist in an enor- mous and rapid distension of the organ by blood, rendering it very large, hard, and stiff*. In the majority of cases it occurs in people in perfect health, and seems to be a purely idio- pathic inflammation : in some cases it seems to have followed exposure to cold, and in others it was associated with febrile disorders. In this disease the first change which occurs is a perceptible enlargement of the tongue, which feels rather stiff, painful, and tender with a little difficulty in speaking, the patient being in other respects well. The case gene- rally proceeds rapidly; in two or three hours the tongue is much larger; there is a good deal of distressing burning felt in it. Sy- nocha, symptomatic of the local inflammation, now occurs, and goes on increasing with the glossitis, and the patient becomes anxious and alarmed. The tongue occupies now the whole cavity of the mouth, or even protrudes, and the jaws are kept apart. Mr. Martin thus describes the condition of the tongue at this stage : — "On examining the tongue, I found that it occupied a large proportion of the 4 E1154- TONGUE. cavity of the mouth; and I could with diffi- cult}' introduce my little ringer between it and the upper jaw. It felt smooth and hard to the touch, and had a thick coating of viscid mucus : from the high degree of tension, the point presented a glistening appearance." (Edinburgh Med. and Surg. Journal, vol. xxviii. p. 76.) As the case advances the tongue increases still further in size, the patient can- not perform the first part of the act of deglu- tition, and the liquid food is obliged to be conveyed by some mechanism into the pha- rynx ; respiration through the mouth ceases, and that through the nares is impeded : the patient is now almost on the verge of suffoca- tion, and his distress and anxiety become extreme. Mr. Martin remarks: — "At this period respiration through the mouth was totally suspended ; and he could not breathe, even through the nostrils, but with difficulty. His countenance was flushed and anxious, the pulse was fluttering, his breathing offensive : in short, he was threatened with immediate suffocation." (Loc. cit., p. 77.) The condition of the tongue sometimes approaches gangrene. Mr. Haves, in describing a similar case at an advanced stage, observes : — "It now began to look of a dark black colour, or rather as if it had been broiled over a smoky fire ; indeed, I expected it would mortify." (Memoirs of the Medical Society of London, vol. ii. p. 193.) I am not aware that mortification has ever resulted in these cases ; neither does abscess appear to be thus produced,* which, however, may be accounted for by the fact, that these urgent cases almost always render it necessary that the organ should be freely incised on the dorsum to evacuate the distending blood, and this would prevent the formation of abscess; though in some very severe instances, where incision has not been practised, no abscess has resulted. When the inflammatory action ceases, which is immediate when the before- mentioned operation is performed, the tongue rapidly recovers, and the fever vanishes. When the tongue is incised, the quantity of blood discharged is very great. The morbid change in the tongue does not always go to the extent above described, and then milder symptoms are produced. Dr. England mentions two mild cases, in both of which the left half of the tongue alone was affected, Dr. Graves relates a severe case, also confined to the left side, in which he says the part " appeared on the verge of gan- grene." (Dublin Hospital Reports, vol. iv. p. 43.) De Lamalle narrates an example, in which the patient was almost suffocated in five hours from the first appearance of the malady. The tongue was more than three times its natural size; it filled the whole mouth, and protruded between the teeth. Free incisions saved the organ and the patient. Trincavellius mentions a case where it oc- * Since the above has been in type, a case occur- ring to Dr. Schneider has been published, where this form of inflammation terminated in abscess. (Casper's Wbchenschrift. No. 23.) curred in Variola ; Mr. Hayes an instance, where an individual, licking an urticarious eruption, had this effect produced to a slight extent on her tongue ; and the same thing, to a small degree, I have known occur from a person eating mussels. Collier, Taynton, Job a Mekren, Paletta, Elbuig, Frank, and Orgill, also enumerate ex- amples of this condition. Dr. Craigie has described a peculiar form of glossitis, under the name of Lingual Quinsy, which is an extension of ordinary quinsy, or tonsillitis. The portion of the tongue involved is that bounded in front by the circumvallate papillae, behind by the epi- glottis, and at the sides by the mucous mem- brane passing off upon the pharynx and rami of the lower jaw. The inflammation extends down the palatoglossus muscle from the ton- sils to the base of the tongue, and seems to involve the mucous, submucous, and muscular tissues. The parts are swollen, infiltrated, and stiff; the lower jaw cannot be depressed, and attempts at deglutition are not only diffi- cult, but the completion of the act is impos- sible. There is an abundant secretion of ropy mucus. Dr. Craigie had one fatal case, in which he found after death, that " the base of the tongue was tumid, hard, and much distended with blood and serum infiltrated into its cellular tissue, and the parts between that and the angle of the jaw were in like manner infiltrated." (Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal, vol. xlii. p. 26.) Mercurial glossitis. — Inflammation of the tongue, the result of the mercurial action, is but one symptom of the constitutional influ- ence of that drug. The tongue in this case becomes large, soft, painful, white and furred, and much indented by the teeth along its edges : the epithelium is soft and readily re- moved, and the surface is apt to ulcerate. The swelling is sometimes very great and rapid. Slegel and Trincavellius each mention such a case. I believe it has never caused suppuration of the organ ; but the discon- tinuance of the mercury is followed by com- plete resolution. Ulceration of the tongue.—This is the most frequent of the morbid changes occurring in the tongue, and of it there are several species and varieties. The different species may be enumerated as, I. The Dyspeptic ulceration, or that arising from disorder of the primae viae; II. Indurated non-malignant ulceration; III. Gangrenous ulceration ; and IV. Syphi- litic ulceration. Dyspeptic ulceration is met with in three principal forms. 1. Small circular ulcerations at the tip and along the edge of the tongue; 2. Severe and deeper ulcerations of the body of the tongue ; and, 3. Aphthous ulceration. The small circular ulcers of the tongue are extremely common, and have been personally experienced by almost every individual. They consist of small, circular, generally regular and well defined ulcers, which are superficial and look as if a piece of mucous membrane had been punched out; the edges are sharp andTONGUE. 1155 4 e 2 well defined : these ulcers vary in size from that of a pin's head to that of a split-pea, or larger ; they are almost constantly situated at the tip, or edges of the tongue; they are sometimes grey, at others red ; when touched against the teeth they are acutely painful, and their presence causes an abundant and con- stant secretion of saliva. In the commence- ment, however, there is no ulceration, but the malady begins by an affection of a papilla, consisting in an effusion of lymph into a fungiform papilla (hereafter to be described), and this terminates in ulceration : the papilla is at first large, yellow, and distended with lymph ; in a few hours it has disappeared, and its site is occupied by an ulcer, which after- wards more or less spreads in a regular, cen- trifugal manner. I believe this process has never before been properly described, — per- sons not being aware that any thing has hap- pened until the ulcer exists, and consequently never seeing or exhibiting the malady in the first stage; but any one, subject to these little infirmities, may satisfy himself of the truth of what I have said by carefully watching the state of his tongue from day to day. The severe and deep-seated ulcerations of the tongue, arising from mere disorder of the alimentary canal, may consist of an extension of the already-described variety, or it may commence by a vesication, or an excoriation of the surface ; it generally occurs in people who are debilitated from some cause or another. Mr. Lawrence relates the following characteristic case : — " A lady, between fifty and sixty, of unhealthy appearance, with a red pimply face, who had often suffered from dis- order of the digestive organs, consulted me for a disease of the tongue of formidable ap- pearance. The middle and upper part of the organ was swollen, and occupied by a deep ulcer of irregular figure and foul aspect. It was very painful, interfering with mastication and articulation. The digestive organs were much disturbed. The complaint yielded speedily and effectually to simple measures — regulation of diet, and the digestive organs, small doses of extract of henbane, and sooth- ing local means." (Clinical Lecture, Medical Gazette, vol. xxxvi. p. 800.) Mr. Lawrence mentions an instance in which rawness and severe excoriation of the tongue often repeated, the result of periodic and long-continued dyspepsia, appear to have induced true scirrhus of the organ. Aphthous ulceration. — The ulceration is merely one stage of a peculiar morbid change, to which the tongue, in common with some other portions of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, is liable. The tongue, however, suffers more severely than most other parts. It is eminently the result of disordered diges- tion, and is accompanied with more or less fever of an atonic character. An aphthous tongue is rather swollen, tender, and furred, and has a sensation of burning heat: on its surface, scattered about irregularly, are small white bodies, resembling little masses of curd, varying in size from a split pea to a pin's- head, attached pretty firmly ; these bodies, as well as the swollen state of the tongue, cause the subject of them pain and inconvenience : after a variable time these little white masses fall off, leaving the membrane on which they rested in an altered condition,—it is either raw and excoriated at these spots, the epithelium being peeled off and leaving the papillae naked, exposed, and red ; or else, the deeper ele- ments of the membrane being affected, an ulcer is formed. These ulcers are generally more or less circular and superficial, and are in no way to be distinguished, at this stage, from the little circular ulcers already described, but aphthae on the neighbouring portions of the tongue disclose their true nature. The white aphthous mass itself has been variously de- scribed as a slough, concrete mucus, and albu- mino-fibrin, but it consists in reality of a mi- nute parasitic fungus, which attaches itself to the mucous membrane and burrows among its epithelial cells. Seen under the microscope, it is found to be composed of threads matted together like felt, and intertwining among the epithelium. Accompanying aphthae are gene- rally to be seen on the surface of the tongue, small vesicae, spots of epithelium raised with a little serum underneath, and also some of the papillae distended with fibrinous exuda- tion — conditions to be described presently. Indurated non-malignant ulceration,—Indu- rated ulcers, which are neither syphilitic nor malignant, but closely resembling scirrhus, are occasionally met with, and their doubtful character gives the surgeon not a little trouble. Mr. Lane narrates the following formidable example : — " Mr. G. B., aged 33, came to me in the month of June, 1813, with a very foul ulcer beneath the tongue, and said that he some time before had had one on the upper part of it, which he said was healed ; but on examination there was a deep irregular fissure, with raised, jagged, hardened edges, commu- nicating with the ulcer under the tongue, which, on examining with a probe, I found not only communicated with the fissure on the upper surface, but the instrument passed through the substance of the tongue, into a deep seated ulcer at the root of it, and thence into the throat. The general appearance of the disease was most alarming, bearing a very strong character of carcinoma. He experienced great pain and difficulty in deglutition, and complained that the pain had of late extended behind the ears, to the back of the head and neck." (Medico-Chirur. Trans., vol. viii.p. 202.) The case, however, was not one of carcinoma, for the patient completely recovered under alterative treatment. About two years since an instance came under my own notice. A man of about 45, had been a sailor ; had never had syphilis ; for about six years had been labouring under a disease of the tongue, w ith little improvement, or permanent change, in its condition. When 1 saw him, the right half of the tongue was enlarged and much indu- rated ; the left was of natural size and soft, but with few papillae ; on the right side no pa- pilla; were to be seen, and the surface was ex-TONGUE. 115G coriated, chapped, and in parts superficially ulcerated. He told me that at one time the left side had heen diseased in a similar way. The lymphatic glands behind and beneath the jaw and down the neck were enlarged and indurated, and had been so from the first. The free application of lunar caustic to the tongue lessened the affection, and the lymphatic glands became smaller and softer; but the other side became afterwards diseased, and was relieved by the same treatment ; the tongue was, however, never restored to a healthy state, though, when I last saw him, there was no ulceration. There was profuse secretion of saliva ; but, with this exception, the man was remarkably healthy. Mr. Lawrence, in his Clinical Lecture, al- ready referred to, describes this condition of tongue. (Loc. at., p. 799, case ii.) Gangrenous ulceration.—The tongue is liable to a peculiar gangrenous ulceration, called " Glossanthrax " or " Malignant pustule." It commences as a vesicle containing bloody serum ; it gradually becomes black and bursts, and the lingual tissues beneath and around it are seen to be gangrenous; this may proceed till the whole tongue is in a state of mortifi- cation : when it exists to this degree, there is fever of a profound typhoid character, with delirium, and the patient soon dies. Audral has given an account of this disease in his Pathological Anatomy. Heyfelder narrates the case of a Prussian butcher, who, when slaughtering a diseased sheep, put the knife and held it for some time between his teeth. In two or three days the margin of his tongue was covered with black pustules. The part swelled alarmingly, and most painfully ; vio- lent fever set in, and the patient was carried oft' in the course of sixty hours. I once saw a patient in low fever, who had enormous sloughing of the dorsum of the tongue, which proceeded in successive por- tions till a large deep excavation, that would have received half a walnut, was produced. Syphilitic ulceration.—Hunter* strangely fell into the error of thinking that venereal ulcer- ations of the tongue are uncommon, whereas they are the most common to which the organ is liable ; and the tongue, next to the tonsils, is more frequently attacked, in the constitu- tional forms of this disease, than any other portion of the mucous surface. A small, circular, superficial ulcer is the most common syphilitic affection of the tongue; it begins exactly like the little ulcers of dyspep- tics, from which it cannot be distinguished. These ulcers are situated principally at the tip and along the edges of the tongue. As in almost all instances of ulceration of the tongue, the ulcer is the second part of the process, and follows the deposition of fibrinous matter under the basement membrane ; in this case in a single papilla, or a few contiguous ones, as I have already described. These ul- * Speaking of ulceration of the tongue, Hunter observes, " these are commonly supposed to be vene- real ; but. 1 believe they seldom are." {Hunter's Trea- tise on the Venereal Disease. Page 337. 2nd Ed. 4to.) cers generally do not extend, but yield to the most simple treatment ; sometimes, however, they do extend, and form various sized un- healthy ulcers, deep in proportion to their extent, cupped and indurated at the base. At other times they show a tendency to run in one direction, and remain superficial : I saw an example of this in a patient who had a very narrow superficial ulcer an inch in length, originating in a small circular ulcer, and ex- tending along the under surface of the tongue, on the left side, just at the point where the mucous membrane is reflected from that organ to the jaw: it was very superficial, and, as it progressed, it attacked the healthy membrane in its course. Rhagades or Jissures in the tongue are not uncommon : they are ulcerated clefts, which extend down, often to a considerable depth, into the substanceofthetongue. Mr. Lawrence describes one three quarters of an inch deep ; though sometimes they only form a chap in the mucous membrane : he also describes one extending the whole length of the tongue, just in its centre, in the long axis ; this was deep, and with irregular ulcerated edges. When seen in the fore part of the organ, they are generally in the middle line, or nearly so ; but those further back are scattered about, and just in front of the cireumvallate papilla?, which is their most usual situation. They are commonly associated with an indurated and irregularly tuberculated surface of tongue -— these tubercular lumps being sometimes like large fissured warts, at others glossy and smooth. The rhagades are generally red, while the surrounding tubercles are grey, or whitish, or, at other times, red and excoriated. The glossy tubercle, to which I have re- ferred, is a remarkable disease : it often forms with great rapidity, and as quickly disappears. It seems to consist in an effusion of lymph into the cellular tissue underlying the mucous membrane ; this effusion is very dense, and raises and distends the surface of the tongue at the affected part above the surrounding por- tions ; the effect is, that the complications of the membrane, which constitute the papilla?, become unfolded, and the papilla? are, as it were, opened out, — they form now one smooth extent, and stretch over a large surface, the faintest indications only of the papilla? being apparent, and sometimes they are totally ob- literated. That this is the true explanation of these smooth tubercles is evident from the fact, that as they form, and in proportion to the distension of the membrane, the papilla? diminish anil shorten ; and as, under the influ- ence of medicines, the swelling decreases, they reappear exactly in the same ratio. These tubercles have little sensation or pain, unless the surface be excoriated ; they are dense, almost as hard as schirrus ; their base is felt pretty deep in the substance of the tongue ; their surface is polished, glossy, ami whitish— they remind me of the tongue of a fish ; they are generally oval or round, when smallish and single, and they are most frequently situated on the dorsum of the tongue, about half an1157 TONGUE. 4 E 3 inch or an inch in front of the circumvallate papillae, and on one side of the mesial line. Sometimes they form over the whole surface of the tongue. Iam acquainted with a gen- tleman who, at the time he was suffering from syphilitic psoriasis, got an attack of dyspepsia ; in less than thirty-six hours the whole of his tongue was one mass of these tubercles, and not a papilla was to be seen ; in a few days (under the influence of iodide of potassium) every papilla had reappeared, and the tongue was in every way natural. This influence of disordered stomach being the immediate and exciting cause of the manifestation of the syphilitic poison on the tongue, I have fre- quently noticed ; a person who has a taint of lues venerea can scarcely sustain the least dis- order of the stomach or bowels without its showing itself upon the tongue. These tu- bercles of the tongue, when left to themselves, are very apt to become fissured and form rhagades; the space between two of them is liable to be the seat of an ulcerated fissure. Deep circular ulcers sometimes form on these tubercles. Phagedenic syphilitic ulcers are seen occa- sionally on the tongues of feeble debilitated people. AH these forms occur as the result of the constitutional taint of lues venerea, at various periods after the primary symptoms. I have known the glossy tubercle and rhagades occur fifteen years after the primary sore. Cancer of the tongue. — The tongue is liable to be affected with scirrhus, having all the properties of genuine cancer. Mr. Travel's has given a very graphic description of cancer of the tongue, which I shall take the liberty of quoting in extenso.— " This is not a smooth and firm rounded tubercle, such as is often met with in this organ, but an irregular rugged knob in its first stage, generally situated in the anterior third, and midway between the raphe and one edge. It sometimes, but seldom, extends across the middle line, although it often extends alongside of it. The hardness is unyielding, inelastic, and the mucous surface puckered and rigid. It also gives to the finger and thumb of the surgeon the sensation of solidity, or of its penetrating the entire mus- cular substance, being perceived equally on either surface. Sharp shoots of pain are felt through the side of the affected organ, towards the angle of the jaw and ear. The disease tends to run backwards towards the base or posterior edge. It sometimes acquires great bulk before ulceration takes place, so as to project the tongue from the mouth. In this state a female patient of mine was seen some time ago in St. Thomas's Hospital, in whom the permanent projection of the diseased organ, beyond the widely distended lips, was from three to four inches. The ulceration often extends from the edge of the tongue to the membrane of the mouth and gums, when the elevated and distended membrane at length gives way, and ulceration is rapid. The sur- face of the ulcer is very uneven ; clean and bright granulations appearing in parts, and in others deep and sloughy hollows. The dart- ing pain is very acute, but only occasional. There is a dull aching always present, and as constant a spitting as in deep salivation. It happens to strong and hitherto healthy per- sons, for the most part males from the age of forty onwards. There is generally an evening paroxysm of pain, and the nights are much disturbed by the secretion accumulating in the throat, which excites cough. Often the patient is roused by a painful compression of the tongue falling between the jaws. Speech is much affected and painful. " Towards the fatal termination of the dis- ease, occasional profuse haemorrhages take place at shortening intervals, and alarm and weaken the patient, who ultimately dies tabid and exhausted, generally with symptoms of more extensive disease of the mucous mem- brane in other parts. " The period at which the sublingual and contiguous lymphatic glands become affected, and the extent of their change, are very vari- able. I have known them form the base of the tumor, the cauliflower fungus occupying half the tongue, i. e. two or three inches long and one broad ; after death the jaw was found covered with fungus." (Medico-Chirurgieal Transactions, vol. xv. part i. p. 245.) The scirrhus is not infrequently at the very margin of the tongue. Louis mentions a case where there was a little circumscribed tubercle of scirrhus, about the size of a filbert, at the edge of the tongue : it was ulcerated. It occasionally shows itself early in life : Arnott mentions a case where it was present in a girl of fifteen. In a subject who died of lingual cancer, dissected by myself, I found that the whole of the right side of the tongue, right tonsil, the upper part of the pharynx on the right side, and the mucous membrane, extending from the tongue to the epiglottis on the same side, were removed by ulceration, and the inner surface of the lower maxilla laid bare. The other half of the tongue was healthy, and only the ulcerated edge was scirrhous. The lymphatics were enlarged, and of a greenish-yellow colour : they con- ained pus. Tumours of the tongue. — A variety of tu- mours have been met with in the tongue. Fatty tumours have been found by Mr. Lis- ton on the under surface of the tongue. Mr. Hale Thomson exhibited to the Westminster Medical Society, in 1839, a fatty tumour which he removed from the side of the tongue. It consisted of fat contained in a cyst. Encysted tumours. — Many of the so-called instances of ranula* have been abundantly proved by Dupuytren, Breschet, and Malgaine to be simply serous cysts, and not obstructed salivary ducts. They consist of dense mem- branous cysts, containing a thick albuminous * The consideration oiranida belongs to the mor- bid anatomy of the salivary glands, and not of tlio tongue.1158 TONGUE. fluid, and not inspissated saliva. They are situated in the cellular tissue immediately under the mucous membrane, where they sometimes grow to an enormous size. Mr. Earle has described curious little vesicular tumours, which he found in the tongue of a boy : — " Clusters of very minute semitrans- parent vesicles pervaded the whole thickness of the tongue, occupying nearly one-half, and projected considerably both above and below that organ. The slightest injury caused the.se to bleed profusely, and in some places the clusters were separated by deep clefts, which discharged a fetid, irritating sanies." (Medico- Chirur. Trans., vol. xii. pt. ii.) The tongue was quite restored by the use of internal medicine. A mulberry-like tumour has been described by Mr. Probart. It formed on the tip of the tongue of a boy four years of age. It was of a peculiar granulated appearance, resembling a half-ripe mulberry, feeling hard and free from pain. It grew gradually: at two months it was the size of a nutmeg; but after that, in five weeks, it rapidly increased till it was of the bigness of a hen's egg, protruding nearly two inches beyond the lips, which were sepa- rated widely by it, preventing the little patient taking any thing but spoon meat, and that with difficulty. It was highly vascular, and bled profusely from innumerable vessels, w hich nothing but the cautery would arrest, when amputated. There was no return of the disease. Polypus-like tumours have been met with on the tongue, consisting of a fleshy mass, like the rest of the organ, attached to it by a pedicle, Louis mentions one of these about the size of a nutmeg, which he removed from the tongue of a young man eighteen years of age: it was situated on the middle of the dorsum of the tongue. A more remarkable example is described by Dr. Huie. The case was that of an old maiden lady, in whom a tumour formed, about three months after a catarrh and inflammation of the fauces, upon the root of the tongue, and gradually increased for twelve months, when " the smooth rounded form of the tumour conveyed, at first sight, the idea that it was of an encysted kind; but, upon examination with the finger, it was found to be as hard and unyielding as the substance of the tongue itself, and evi- dently of the nature of polypus." (Edinb. Med.-Chlrur. Trans., vol. iii. p. 72.) It filled nearly the whole pharynx, and moved with the tongue, to which it was attached by a pedicle. Ligature was subsequently applied, by which it was removed. " The tumour, which is in the Museum of the lloyal College of Surgeons (of Edinburgh), was of an oval form, weighed exactly an ounce, and mea- sured five inches in its long, and four in its short, circumference. It was broadest op- posite the insertion of the pedicle, which entered at the distance of an inch from the upper part of the tumour. A longitudinal incision, which has been made into it, displays a firm cartilaginous nucleus, as large as a chestnut, surrounded by a fibro-cartilaginous structure, forming the rest of the tumour." (Loc. eit., p. 76.) I strongly suspect that all these pedunculated tumoiu's of the tongue are hypertrophied fungiform or circumvallate papillae. Hypertrophy and prolapsus of the tongue.— This is a singular affection, which usually commences in infancy, and is sometimes con- genital. It generally begins and progresses slowly by an enlargement of the organ within the mouth; it afterwards projects perma- nently between the lips, and then advances more rapidly, and the tongue, which was before of normal, though hypertrophied, struc- ture, becomes parched and fissured on the upper surface, and ulcerated beneath. Some- times the amount of tongue that is protruded is enormous. The os hyoides and larynx are drawn up, whilst the jaw is depressed, and the incisors are pushed out in a horizontal direction. Dr. Wells, of Columbia, has given a good case, of which the following is a condensed description. The patient was a little girl, six years old, with an enormous enlargement of the tongue; otherwise she was in good health, and a fine robust girl. The following are the dimensions and state of the tongue at the time: — length, as it remained at rest and hung down over the chin, from the superior incisors to the apex, two and a half inches; circumference just in front of the lips, six inches ; breadth, from one angle of the mouth to the other, a little more than two inches. It had undergone a very considerable change in structure, was much more dense than na- tural, and not subject to change in its dimen- sions by the action of its own muscles, or, if at all, very slightly so. Its motions other- wise were sufficiently free: upper surface smooth ; inferior covered with the cicatrices of old ulcers, several of which, where the tongue rested upon the alveolar processes of the lower jaw, were but imperfectly healed ; colour darker than natural. Within the mouth the tongue had undergone no apparent change except a moderate increase in width and thickness. The front teeth had been dis- placed from the lower jaw by the long-con- tinued pressure of the tongue. The lower lip was folded downwards. The anterior por- tion of the superior maxillary bone had under- gone a slight curve upwards ; the inferior a much greater curve downwards; so that when the back teeth came in contact, the front were an inch asunder, or, rather, the space between the upper teeth and the corresponding alveolar processes below was something more than an inch. This condition of tongue commenced by an attack of glossitis in infancy. A portion of the organ was removed by ligature, and she completely recovered. Mr. Crosse mentions a girl of six years old, in whom the tongue was prolapsed three or four inches ; and this was completely reduced by pressure and leeching. Mr. Liston has described an instance in which the tongue projected three or four1159 TONGUE. 1 e 4 inches from the lips of a young man, nineteen years of age, the disease having been con- genital. It was of a brown and livid colour, rough, granulated, and fissured, and beneath the mucous membrane were abundant venous plexuses. This tongue was liable to periodic intumescence, when it became much larger, was very painful, and bled profusely. Mr. Liston has stated his belief, that, from the periodical enlargement and diminution of the tongue, and the erectile tissue being evident in many parts of its surface, the mass was partly composed of a structure resembling aneurism by anastomosis. These hypertrophied tongues, when cur- tailed by the knife or ligature sufficiently to be taken within the teeth, generally soon accommodate themselves to the form and dimensions of the oral cavity. Professor Lassus has given instances, where this has been accomplished by means of ban- daging and compressing the tongue. Atrophy of the tongue. — I am not ac- quainted with any instance of atrophy of the entire organ, nor with any unassociated with paralysis. It generally shosvs itself in cases of hemiplegia, when the tongue does not im- mediately recover, and results from diminished nutrition, the consequence of want of ex- ercise, being confined to the paralysed half, just as the arm and leg of the affected side become atrophied under the like circum- stances. It is more obvious, however, when the hypoglossal nerve alone is the seat of injury or disease. Professor Budd mentions, in his lectures, an instance which fell under the care of his brother, Dr. William Budd, of a man who sustained a stab in the neck, dividing the external carotid artery and hypo- glossal nerve on the left side. The artery was secured, and the man recovered with palsy of the left side of the tongue. At the end of some weeks that half of the tongue was much wasted, and all the movements of the organ were performed by the other half. The atrophy was confined to the muscular element of the organ : taste and touch re- mained uninjured.— {MS. Notes of Lecture.) Dupuytren mentions an example of atrophy and paralysis* of the left half of the tongue caused by the pressure, upon the hypoglossal nerve, of an hydatid cyst in the anterior con- dyloid foramen. In this condition, as well as in hemiplegia, the state of the tongue is remarkable from one part of the organ being passive, while the other is active. As long as it is at rest, the diminished size of the affected side is all that is observable. When the tongue is extruded, it is thrust over towards the affected side, — it emerges from the mouth obliquely, because the extruding muscles of the sound side have no antagonists. The paralysis of the intrinsic transverse muscular fibres gives rise to another phenomenon, which I have never seen de- * la both these cases the muscular motion was the only function implicated, which, as Dupuytren ob- serves, is interesting physiologically; taste and or- dinary sensation not being in the least affected. scribed,—it is the curved form of the tongue itself; the raphe in the middle of the tongue is not straight, but curved, and the concavity looks towards the affected side, These fibres, whose function it is to make narrow, and, by that, to lengthen the tongue, only act on one side, and only half the tongue is thus elon- gated ; and this, being adherent to the other half which sustains no elongation, is thrown into an arch, on the same principle as the curving of the compound wire in a Brcguet's thermometer. Diseases of the papilla:. — In considering the diseases of the surface of the tongue, authors have not taken sufficient care to consider the true anatomy of the papillary membrane, and their descriptions are consequently loose and ill-defined. It is of the utmost importance to state where the morbid changes are situated ; whether above or beneath the basement mem- brane ; whether it is the epithelium, or the vessels and sub-basement areolar tissue that have undergone the alteration. The papillae are liable to hypertrophy, atro- phy, effusion of blood or of fibrine into their interior ; they may be denuded of their epi- thelium, or that covering may be stained or rendered opaque, producing what is called fur. Hypertrophy of papillae. — The circumvallate papilla? are liable to be enlarged, the central portion forming a little tumour, rising above the surrounding ring of membrane. Dr. An- drew Ferguson has described them as increas- ing to the size of peas. There are generally several affected at once. I have seen them increased to this size, as well as, some of the fungiform papillae at the back of the tongue, in an individual suffering from scrofulous enlarge- ment of the tonsils. The polypoid tumours (retaining the same form and proportions as these papillae, though greatly enlarged), 1 believe to be nothing more than hypertrophied fungiform, or circumvallate papilla. The conical or filiform papilla? are liable to a peculiar change, which has, to the best of my knowledge, never been described. It consists in an enormous increase in their epithelial element, forming long cylindrical rods ; in fact, hairs: the only apparent channe in these organs being superficial to the base- ment membrane. I am in possession of the notes of two examples of this malady. For the first 1 am indebted to my brother, Dr. James Salter. He observes, " My patient was an old gentleman, impoverished by in- temperance ; his general health was good, and he was now temperate : for some years he had suffered from the peculiar affection of the tongue under which he now laboured. This affection was a great elongation of the conical and filiform papillae, in all parts of the tongue where these abound : they were eight or ten times their natural length, and over-lapped each other, like the pile of plush, or long velvet. The hypertrophy appeared to be en- tirely in the long axis ; there was no increase in circumference, and they were little larger at their base than the apex. They were soft, and lay over lapping each other on the sur-TONGUE. 11G0 face ; and by smoothing the finger over the tongue they could be brushed from one side to the other. Their colour was deep Van- dyke-brown, and they were most numerous in the centre of the tongue. They looked ex- actly like little brown hairs. Sensation and taste were both a good deal damaged." To my friend, Dr. Joseph Bullar, I am indebted for the other instance. His patient was an old lady of sixty-five ; she had been subject to constipation, for which she was in the habit of taking strong purgatives. The tongue was large, vascular, and the papilla? of all kinds prominently marked. It looked in an irritable condition, as if sympathising with a congested mucous membrane. On the middle and back of the dorsum was a patch of hypertrophied filiform papilla;, of a dark sepia colour, or rather of the brown colour of a dark typhoid tongue. These filamentous growths were re- moved by forceps, and some were sent to me, from which I made the accompanying draw- ings. The specimens that I received were very dark, almost black : I have some of them in my possession now, nearly or quite half an inch long ; their texture was very compact, and their shape cylindrical, with hardly any trace of tapering. They all, as seen by the Fig. 764 microscope, possessed a retrorse imbrication of the same character as ordinary filiform pa- pilla? {Jig. 764.). The epithelium did not con- tain any granular pigment, but the colour appeared to pervade the whole cell, which was evenly stained and semi-transparent. In Jig. 764. is seen a papilla, or hair, at full length, and in Jig. 765. a portion of another, showing the imbrication of the epithelium. The Scarlatina tongue contrasts remarkably with the preceding ; for here the deeper ele- ments of the papillae are principally the seat of change. In scarlet fever the capillaries of the papilla;, in common with the sub-basement vascular system of so large a portion both of the internal and external surfaces of the body, become turgid, and the papillae themselves — not so much their epithelium — become en- Fig. 765.

In the early stages of the fever this change is concealed by the fur (which is a sodden and opaque condition of epithelium), as it regards the filiform papilla.-, —fur being, in all cases I believe, confined to these and the papilla? conicae. Not so the fungiform papilla? ; for these are exaggerated and bright red. The result is, that the surface is a combination of thick white cream-like fur and red projected spots, the former being most conspicuous where the filiform papilla? abound — the central portions of the tongue, — and the latter in the regions of the papillae fungiforma? — the edges and tip of the tongue. These fungiform papilla? look like theachasnia scattered on the surface of the fruit of the strawberry. As the disease advances, the epithelial covering is shed, and only a thin transparent epithelium remains : the papilla? are consequently red and bright all over the surface, which is clean, rough, red, and raw- looking in every part. Atrophy of the papilla? is occasionally met with. Mr. Lawrence mentions the case of a person in whom, from habitual drinking, the tongue was, for the greater part of its surface,IJ61 TONGUE. destitute of papillae : it was white, smooth and opaque on the surface. I have already men- tioned the obliteration of the papillae in the glossy tubercle of syphilis, and it also occa- sionally occurs in lues venerea, independent of the tubercle. I have seen the tongues of old people re- markably bald, especially as it regards the filiform papillae: as a general rule, these pa- pillae are less prominent in the aged. Effusions into papillce.— The fungiform pa- pillae are liable to be the seat of little extrava- sations of blood. I am acquainted with a medi- cal gentleman who has himself frequently had ibis trivial affection. It has always occurred to him in the night, and is indicated by a sharp pain, as though the tongue were stabbed by a red-hot needle, caused, doubtless, by the pres- sure of the blood upon the nerves in the papilla. Upon examining the tongue a papilla is seen to be distended into a minute capsule of blood, at first red, and afterwards black. The coagu- lum is absorbed in a few days, and the papilla resumes its former appearance. Lymph of a grey or ash-colour is apt to be deposited in and under the papillae, in the tongues of persons tainted with syphilis. When this occurs on the dorsum, it gives a grey speckled appearance to the patch, some of the papillae in the spot being unaffected. It looks as though this circumscribed surface had been rubbed with chalk. The patches vary in size from a split pea to a fourpenny piece. Occurring under the tip and along the under edge of the tongue, the appearance is a whitish even spot, of gristly texture, and not presenting a speckled appearance, the papillae here being invisible, and covered up uniformly with epithelium. This is the most common situation for these spots, which after a time become fissured, and ulcerate. Lymph, effused into a fungiform papilla, is the commencement of the common little cir- cular ulcer on the tip and edge of the tongue. I have snipped off) and examined under the microscope, one of these papillae. It was filled with a yellow, opaque, granular, sub-fibrous mass The papilla is not only enlarged by this effusion of lymph, but is altered in form ; its pedicle is elongated, and its head flattened. When the papilla does not ulcerate,but returns to a healthy state, its contents are absorbed, it diminishes in size, and the summit of the papilla becomes pitted in the centre. It then gradually assumes its natural size, shape, and colour. This may be easily seen by watching, every few hours, a patient's tongue through an ordinary pocket lens. Denuded papillce. — The papilla: are occa- sionally denuded by the effusion of serum be- tween the basement membrane and epithelium, by which this latter is raised into a blister, and is subsequently rubbed off'by the motions of the tongue, leaving the red naked papillae beneath. This denuded surface is red as com- pared with the surrounding, and smooth, but when viewed through a magnifier the small naked papillae are seen to be regular and per- fect. This surface is not ulcerated, but feels sore when touched. I have lately seen a patch, the size of a shilling, thus denuded in a patient suffering from diarrhoea. Fur. — The fur of the tongue is the epithe- lium, principally of the conical and filiform papillae, variously altered. It is most abund- ant where these papilla: are most plentiful, and it will be found, by inspecting minutely a furred tongue, that the fungiform papillae have undergone very little, if any, change. I be- lieve, with M. Piorry, that the fur of the tongue is chiefly dependent upon the con- dition of the saliva and mucus of the mouth : and, holding this view, it is easy to understand how it is that the filiform and conical papillae are principally affected ; they hang among the fluids of the mouth, exposing a large super- ficies in proportion to their bulk ; their sur- face is uneven and broken, and this, with the imbricated state of the epithelial particles, make them quickly and thoroughly imbibe, and become saturated with, any fluid into which they are immersed. In all this they contrast with the fungiform papillae, whose surface, in proportion to bulk, is small, and whose epithe- lium is spread in a thin, even sheet, smoothly over their surface. It must have been ob- served by every one, that the colour of the papillae of a brown typhoid tongue is identical with that of the sordes around the teeth, which is nothing more than the saliva and mucus, in which these papillae have been bathed, inspis- sated, and is doubtless the source of their colour. The white fur consists of a white, opaque, soft, sodden epithelium, which, when viewed under the microscope, differs from the epithelium in its ordinary state, in no other particular than its opacity. When the fur is crown, the epithelium presents the appearance of being simply and evenly stained. There are no opaque pigmentary particles in the cavity of the cell. The various amounts and characters of the fur ; the different arrangements of it in dif- ferent diseases and at different stages ; the al- terations, form, and size of the tongue, &c.; all symptomatic of morbid changes elsewhere, and belonging rather to the physician than the morbid anatomist, I shall not stop to describe. But it must not be forgotten that, in health, many of these conditions are natural to some persons: in some, the tongue is habitually furred, in others it is chapped, ragged, and irregular. The healing and reparation of the papillary surface of the tongue is not a little remark- able. I have known the surface of the tongue, after it has been immensely disfigured, es- pecially in syphilitic cases, by tubercles, and rhagades, and ulcers, restored almost to its former condition. After ulceration it would seem that the cicatrix contracts to a mere line, while the surrounding mucous membrane becomes extended, and either fresh papillae form, or else the minute simple papillae in- crease in dimensions, and become comphcated, for the papillary surface is ultimately quite restored. I shall conclude these observations on theTONGUE. 1162 morbid anatomy of the tongue with some re- marks on faulty positions which the organ oc- casionally obtains. I have already spoken of prolapsus of the tongue, and there now re- main for consideration — tongue-tie, tongue- swallowing, and adhesion of the tongue to ad- jacent parts. Tongue-tie. — This is a congenital malform- ation, consisting in the frsenum extending too far forwards and being short, thus tying down the tongue behind the incisor teeth of the lower jaw. This may occur to any degree, from an amount that is scarcely observable, to the complete tying down the tip of the tongue behind the necks of the middle incisors of the lower jaw. The fraenum generally con- sists simply of a small amount of fibrous tissue contained in the fold of mucous membrane; but it sometimes contains fibres of the genio- glossus, which occasionally extend a con- siderable way forwards: in the former case the frsenum is thin, in the latter it may be of some thickness. When left to nature the tie gradually lengthens, and, at the same time, recedes, and any unusual thickness arising from the presence of muscular fibres gra- dually lessens. This condition, to a slight extent, is very frequent, and appears to be hereditary. The cases are, however, extremely rare where the frsenum is so short as to inter- fere with sucking, mastication, deglutition, or articulation. Tongue-swallowing. — This arises from the opposite of the last condition: the move- ments of the tongue are too free; it can be inverted, and its apex thrown back into the pharynx, which embraces it, and thus closes the aperture leading to the lungs, and symp- toms of suffocation are the result. It most frequently happens to infants. It is enume- rated by writers on Medical Jurisprudence, as one of the modes of suicide among negroes. Dr. Gordon Smith, Majendie, and Beck refer to cases of it. Mr. Crosse tells of an instance, where it could be performed at pleasure with- out the slightest inconvenience. Adhesions of the tongue. — Bernard relates an instance, in which adhesions, of the thick- ness of two lines and a half, had agglutinated the lateral parts of the tongue to the internal surface of the cheeks, to the extent of more than an inch on each side. These adhesions had succeeded an inflammation in the inside of the mouth and tongue, the circumference of which had ulcerated; they interrupted the functions of speech and mastication. M. Ber- nard divided them by a single clip of the scissors. Necrosis of the hyoid bone. — The only in- stance of disease of the hyoid bone with which I am acquainted, is one related by Mr. Spr}-. The disease was necrosis, the result of ex- tended ulceration, which commenced in the throat, and continued till the bone was laid bare and dead. It was then expectorated en- tire. The patient died several weeks after- wards. The bone was entirely deprived of periosteum, irregular on its surface, and in a perfect state of necrosis. [Since this Article has been in the press I have become acquainted with a discovery of Prof. Kolliker's, that the muscular fibres in certain situations are bifurcated and branched. In a letter to Prof. Bowman he says, that this is brilliantly exhibited by the muscles of the tongue, and he gives a pen and ink illustration of the method of branching. There can be no doubt about a fact so detailed by such an au- thority, but I must confess that I have not recognised the appearances described.] Bibliography. — Albums, De Periglottide et Corpore reticulari Lingua; ; in Annot.

(//. Hi/dc Salter.)TOUCH. TOUCH. — The sense through which we take cognisance of the palpable properties of bodies. The term is used, however, in two meanings, between which it is requisite to maintain a due discrimination. In its ex- tended acceptation, it implies our conscious- ness of all those sensory impressions, which are neither olfactive, visual, auditory, nor gustative ; and it is therefore designated as the general sense, in contradistinction to those, which are considered as special senses. In its most limited application, on the other hand, it is used to designate that modification of the general sensibility, which is restricted to the tegumentary surface, or to some special portion of it, and which serves to excite definite ideas in our minds respecting the form, size, number, configuration, weight, tem- perature, hardness, softness, &c, of objects brought within its cognisance. The use of the sense of Touch, in the acquirement of these ideas, is, as we shall see hereafter, a very complex process ; involving not merely the discriminating employment of the proper organs of touch, but also the assistance of muscular action, and of the information de- rived from it by the " muscular sense." General Sensibility.—The most universal of all the qualities or properties of matter (that, in fact, upon which our notion of it _ is founded) is resistance; and it is of this quality that we find the power of cog- nisance most extensively diffused through the body, and most universally possessed by all beings endowed with consciousness. It would seem to require nothing else than the presence of nerves connected (directly or indirectly) with sensorial centres ; for there does not appear to be a need of any special organisation, surrounding the peripheral ex- tremities of these nerves, in order that they may receive and transmit impressions. Thus any unusual pressure on a nerve in its course is at once perceived by the mind, — not, however, as pressure, but as a disagreeable or painful sensation, which gives no indication of the mode in which it was excited. The nerves of smell, sight, and hearing, are not thus affected by mechanical irritation, no manifestations of pain being exhibited when they are pinched, torn, lacerated, &c.; and the general sensibility which these organs of sense possess is dependent upon otheiMierves. The nerves of taste, however, exhibit the same susceptibility to tactile impressions, as do those of touch ; and hence we have an additional proof of the very close affinity of these two senses (See Taste). The only condition requisite for the ex- ercise of " general sensibility," beyond the integrity of the nervous apparatus, is the adequate supply of oxygenated blood. Wher- ever sensory nerves exist, we find them ac- companied by blood-vessels; and no non- vascular tissue possesses in itself the least degree of sensibility. Thus, in the epidermis, hair, nails, cartilage, and tooth-substance, nei- ther nerves nor blood-vessels exist, and we find these tissues completely insensible. In 1103 tendons, ligaments, fibrous membranes, and in other parts whose function is purely me- chanical, we find very little vascularity, and extremely little sensitiveness to ordinary im- pressions ; it is remarkable, however, that although the tissues, whose function it is to re- sist tension, are scarcely impressible by cutting, burning, &c, they cannot be unduly stretched without considerable pain. So, also, the serous and synovial membranes are not in the least susceptible of ordinary tactile impressions in their healthy state ; but they become acutely- sensitive when inflamed. It does not at ail follow, however, that the sensibility of a part should increase with its vascularity ; for we find that some of the most vascular organs in the body are the least sensitive, the supply of blood which they receive having some pur- pose entirely different. Thus the sensibility of the muscles is by no means proportionate to the large amount of blood which they re- ceive ; and even the substance of the brain (like that of the nerves of special sensation) is destitute of this property. So, again, the mucous membranes lining the interior of the several viscera, though supplied with blood even more copiously than the skin, are very far inferior to it in sensibility. The depend- ence of this endowment, however, wherever it exists, upon the continued circulation of the blood, is at once made apparent by the results of its suspension ; thus, when the main artery of a limb is tied, there is a dimi- nution of the sensibility both of its surface and of its substance, which is so exactly proportioned to the degree in which the sup- ply of blood is diminished, and the reco- very fr om which takes place so precisely in accordance with the establishment of the col- lateral circulation, that we cannot doubt that, if the supply of blood were completely cut off', sensibility would be entirely suspended. The numbness produced by cold, in like manner, is partly due to the stagnation which it occasions in the capillary circulation in the skin ; though it is doubtless in part attributable to the immediate depressing influence of the cold upon the vital endowments of the ner- vous apparatus itself. The general sensibility of the body may be called into activity by impressions received from objects external to it, or by causes ori- ginating in itself; and the consequent sensa- tions are sometimes distinguished as " ex- ternal" and '-internal." These designations are by no means logically correct; for all sensations must originate in causes external to the recipient mind; whilst, on the other hand, in order that any sensation may be felt a certain condition of'the corporeal organism must first be produced ; and this condition may be precisely the same, whether it be immediately dependent upon changes ori- ginating in the body itself, or upon ^ehan^es impressed upon it from some agency external to it. Still, however, the terms " external " and " internal " sensations are sufficiently con- venient, and sufficiently free from the pro- bability of misconception, to justify the phy-It64 TOUCH. siologist in the employment of them ; and they will be accordingly employed in our present enquiry. The external sensations received through this medium all require the absolute contact* of the body which excites them, with the im- pressible part ; and in this respect, therefore, there is an exact correspondence between the general sensibility and the sense of taste. The force with which the impression is made, is judged of by the intensity of the sen- sation and the depth to which it is felt; whilst the size of the object is in some degree es- timated by the extent of surface over which its contact is perceived. Both these estimates, however, are extremely vague, when they depend only upon the general sensibility of the body ; we shall hereafter see how much more precise they become, when the impressions are received through the skin, which is the special organ of touch, and when they are aided and corrected by the muscular sense. Still we find that the different modes in which external objects affect even the general sensibility, produce a very marked diversity in the character of the sensations. Thus the feeling called forth by a prick is of a very different kind from that which arises from a blow; both, again, are very distinct from that produced by a steady uniform pressure; and all these are very different from the sensation of stretching or tearing. In the case of a prick, we have an intense impression made on the sensible part ; but this is limited to a very small spot ; whilst the impression of a blow is made with a like intensity over a much larger area.f In the case of steady pressure, on the other hand, the impression is made over a large surface, but is less in- tense ; whilst in stretching and tearing, the mechanical condition of the nerves of the part operated on is affected in a manner pre- cisely opposite to that in which it is acted on by pressure. The sense of shock, derived from a blow extending over a large surface, is very distinct from that of the mere blow, and may be experienced when little or no pain is felt, as from the "wind" of a shot; and nearly allied to this is the peculiar jar which is experienced, when the shock is transmitted in such a manner as especially to affect the solid casing of the nervous centres, — as when we jump from a height, without sufficient care to alight in such a * There might seem to be an exception to this statement in regard to heat and cold, which are perceived when their source is at any distance that allows its radiations to affect the temperature of the body itself. But, as will presently be shown, it does not appear that the sense of temperature forms part of the general sensibility of the body; the power of appreciating heat or cold, as such, being limited to the special organs of touch. t There can be no doubt that a multitude of pricks made at the same moment, in sufficiently close proximity to prevent them from being separately distinguished, would be felt as a blow; this being the only sensation which is received from the numerous incisions simultaneously made by the seariheator used in cupping, when it is applied to the parts of the skin endowed with the least discriminating power. manner as to deaden the concussion by the elasticity of the feet, &c. A succession of slight impulses rapidly following one another, gives rise to the peculiar sensation of thrill; which, though most readily excited when the impressions are made upon the skin, may be received through the internal organs also as when we hold a vibrating body between the teeth. These and other well-marked differences in the kind of information received through the general sensibility of the body, seem ob- viously attributable rather to diversities in the mode in which the impressions are made, than to any differences in the nature of the impressions themselves, the character of the fibres receiving them, or the endowments of the ganglionic centres in which these fibres terminate. And hence we seem to have a greater right to conclude, that the various affections of general sensibility, which are usually ranked under the common head of internal sensations, however unlike they may be one to another, are really derived from impressions which do not mutually differ so essentially as do those of the special senses from each other and from the general sense. Of this kind are the sensations of hunger and thirst, the "besoin de respirer," the genital sense, the sensation which calls for the expul- sion of the urine and fajces, nausea, the feelings of oppression and of" sinking" at the stomach, burning, itching, tingling, formication, and' others. However different these are from each other, when but slightly or moderately- excited, they all merge, when more strongly called forth, into the simple consciousness°of pain ; and it is further common to them all, that the nerves through which they are ex- cited are the same as those which commu- nicate the impressions that excite tactile sensations, and that mechanical irritation of any of these nerves occasions pain. To the foregoing may be added the " muscular sense," whereby we are informed of the degree of effort put forth by a muscle; and the sense of " fatigue," which seems to be a modifica- tion of this. We are not conscious either of effort or fatigue in the actions of any of the muscles over which the will has no "control, such as the heart, the muscular walls of the intestinal canal, &c; nor in the case of those whose actions are purely rhythmical, as those of respiration. It is, in fact, only when the will is exerted, either in increasing the force of their contractions, or in antagonising them by the operation of some other muscles, that we become conscious of effort; and we shall hereafter see that this sense is most important, in enabling us to proportion the amount of force we exert to the resistance to be over- come, and in guiding us with regard to the direction in which exertion is required. A sense of effort and of fatigue seems also to be excited in the sensorium by the mental opera- tions of which the cerebrum is the instrument; especially when these mental operations are no longer spontaneous, or carried on with facility, but when they require a more or lessTOUCH. potent exertion of the will to keep them in activity. As we have every reason to believe that all mental exertion, like muscular force, involves (in our present state of being) a dis- integration of the substance of its instrument — the brain, — there is no difficulty in under- standing that this disintegration, when carried beyond a certain point, may excite the sense of fatigue (see Sleep), just as the "besoin de respirer" is felt after we have withheld our respiratory movements for a few seconds, or hunger when there is a deficiency of nu- tritious matter in the circulating current. It has been said by Mr. Mayo, " that the frame is in the completest health and condition, when the internal sensations are not excited ; the healthiest self-feeling being an absence of all inward sensation." This, however, is scarcely a sufficient account of the fact; for, in the highest condition of health, there is not only an absence of all uneasy feeling, but a general sense of buoyancy and resiliency, dif- ficult to describe in words, which may be characterised as the positive sense of well- being. So, on the other hand, without any positive or distinct sensation, there may be a consciousness of general discomfort, which has been expressively termed by the French malaise. These two sensations may probably be considered as originating in the condition of the blood; the first being an indication of its purity, and of its perfect adaptation to the wants of the system ; whilst the second would seem to proceed from a slight depravation of its quality, resulting not unfrequently from the imperfect elimination of excretory matters, such as is not sufficient in itself to constitute an actual disease. Having thus passed in review the principal manifestations of the general sensibility of the body, and the conditions under which they occur, we have now to proceed to the investigation of the sense of touch, as exer- cised by the organs specially adapted for the reception of tactile impressions. Sense of Touch. Special Organs of Touch.— The peculiar endowments of the tegumentary surface, which enable us to draw from the impres- sions received through it, information of so much more varied and definite a character than we can derive through any of the struc- tures which it invests, appear to consist prin- cipally, so far as the organ itself is concerned, in its greater sensibility (that is, in its greater aptitude for being affected by slight impres- sions), and in its greater power of commu- nicating distinct impressions from points in close proximity ; but a large part of our in- formation is dependent upon our power of giving motion to the tactile organ, and thus of increasing the force and variety of the impres- sions which we derive through its surface, as well as of receiving impressions of an entirely different kind, from the action of the muscles by which that motion is given. Thus, if we simply bring a solid body into contact with the point of the finger, we gain but little 11G5 information of the nature of its surface, whether rough, smooth, or polished ; and we can judge nothing of its form, except in regard to that part of it in actual contact with the fingers ; and even this is but vaguely ap- preciated. This information may be rendered somewhat more precise by pressing the object against the finger; as we shall then feel the impression made by elevations, points, or roughnesses, if they'be sufficiently prominent and wide apart from each other; whilst from the degree of muscular force we exert, and from the amount of yielding of which we are conscious in the object itself, we judge of its hardness, softness, elasticity, &c. But our power of discrimination is immensely in- creased, when we move the tactile surface on the body to be examined, or vice versa; for, from the succession of impressions then made, we obtain our best idea of the character of the surface of the object; whilst by the combination of the tactile impressions with the muscular sense, we judge of the relative positions and connections of its different parts, and of the form of the whole. But besides this, we find that impressions may be derived through the skin, which are not re- ferable to a mere exaltation of its common sensibility, being apparently of a different cha- racter from any of which we become con- scious through other structures; such, espe- cially, are sensations of temperature. Still there would seem no sufficient cause for rank- ing even these in a distinct category from the ordinary tactile impressions; for the feeling of heat or cold does not differ more from that of roughness or smoothness, than does the colour of the object, as seen by the eye, from its form as distinguished by the same organ. The different parts of the cutaneous^ sur- face are endowed with tactile sensibility in very different degrees ; and this variation seems closely to correspond with the degree of development of that papillary structure, which may be regarded as the special organ of touch, strictly so called. These papillae are most elevated and numerous on the tip of the tongue and the points of the fingers ; are less so on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet; are comparatively small and few on the integument of the limbs, and on several parts of the trunk can scarcely be dis- covered at all. They are described by Messrs. Todd and Bowman* as having an average length in man of ^th of an inch ; and°a diameter at their base, where they spring from the cuticle, of about ^th of an'inch. &Their form is somewhat conical, tapering off to a slightly rounded [joint. Their surface (after the removal of the epidermis) appears to be composed of the basement membrane of the cutis itself; and their interior is composed of fibrous tissue, vessels, and nerves. In each papilla we find a small arterial twig, derived from the arterial plexus of the cutis; this, advancing towards the apex of the papilla! subdivides into two or more capillary ves- * Physiological Anatomy, vol. i. p. 410.1166 TOUCH. sels; and these, forming loops whose con- vexity lies in the summit of the papilla, re- unite into venous radicles, which discharge their blood into the venous plexus of the cutis. " The vascularity of the papillae," as Messrs. Todd and Bowman correctly remark, (loc. cit.~), " is such, that their presence and relative size may be determined simply by the depth of the colour imparted to the skin by a good injection of its vessels ; the vascularity of the integument is, therefore, in general terms, proportioned to its perfection as an organ of touch." With regard to the nervous supply of these papillae, however, it is less easy to speak with confidence. It is derived, like the sanguiferous, from the plexus in the substance of the cutis, lying parallel to the surface ; the tubular fibres ascend, to all ap- pearance singly, from this plexus into the papillae ; but their mode of termination or return are not distinguishable with certainty. The following are the results of the in- quiries of Messrs. Todd and Bowman on this point. " In regard to the presence of nerves in the papilla? themselves, we can affirm that we have distinctly traced solitary tubules ascending among the other tissues of the papillae about half-way to their summits, but then becoming lost to sight, either by simply ending, or else by losing the white substance of Schwann, which alone enables us to dis- tinguish them in such situations from other textures We have in numerous in- stances failed to detect any nerves at all within the papillae, when such were plainly visible at their base, and when, consequently, the che- mical agent employed could scarcely have destroyed their characteristic structure had they been present. We incline to the belief that the tubules, either entirely or in great measure, lose the white substance when within the papillae."* With these statements, so far as they go, the writer's own observa- tions are in entire accordance ; but he thinks that from the appearances presented by sec- tions examined by reflected instead of by transmitted light, it may be inferred that the nervous tubules in the tactile papillae undergo a change somewhat similar to that which is said by Wagner to take place in the nervous tubuli of muscle ; namely, that whilst the white substance of Schwann is not traceable beyond a certain point, the central axis is continued further, and that this breaks up into minuter fibrillae, which form loops, like those of the capillary blood vessels, returning into the tubular fibre itself. In the lower animals, as in man, it may be observed that the papillary structure is espe- cially developed on those parts of the tegu- mentary surface which arc especially endowed with tactile sensibility, and the impressions received through which are of important use in finding the movements of the instruments of locomotion. Thus in the quadrumana generally, both the hands and feet are thickly set with papillae; and in those which have a * Op. cit. p. 412. prehensile tail, the surface of this organ pos- sesses them in abundance. In the carnivorous and herbivorous mammalia, whose extremi- ties are furnished with claws or encased in hoofs, we find the lips and the parts sur- rounding the nostrils to be the chief seat of tactile sensibility, and to be copiously furnished with papillae ; this is especially the case with those which have the lips or nos- trils prolonged into a snout or proboscis, as in the pig, the rhinoceros, the tapir, and the elephant. In the mole, too, the papillary structure is remarkably developed at the ex- tremity of the snout. The only part of the skin of birds on which tactile papillae have been discovered is on the under surface of the toes, and on the web of the palmipedes, where they obviously receive impressions, which guide the prehensile and other move- ments of the feet. It is probable, however, that the very sensitive skin which covers the greater part of the mandibles in the duck tribe, is furnished with papillae; the tactile impressions received through this part, when the bill is plunged into mud &c, being the chief means by which the presence of food is discovered. In many lizards a papillary struc- ture is found on the under surface of the toes ; and in the chameleon it exists, also, on the integuments of its prehensile tail. In the soft skinned batrachia, an imperfect papillary structure is more extensively diffused over the surface; but on the thumb of the male frog, and probably on that of other batrachia, there is an extraordinary development of pa- pillary tissue at the season of sexual excite- ment, large papillae being formed all over it. This organisation is obviously connected with the extraordinary prehensile propensity which is then displayed by the animal, and which enables him to keep the female in his grasp during the whole period of the discharge of the ova, in a manner which no voluntary effort could effect. In serpents and chelonians, no papillary apparatus has yet been detected ; and in fishes and invertebrata its presence has not been ascertained, although it would ap- pear that certain parts, especially the tenta- cula around the oral orifice, are endowed with a high degree of tactile sensibility.* But it is not only on the tegumentary sur- face of the exterior of the body, that tactile sensibility is particularly acute ; nor is the pa- pillary apparatus restricted to it alone. In the tongue of man, we find the sense of touch remarkably developed, especially at its tip ; and of the papillae with which its surface is beset, it is probable that some are the instru- ments of tactile sensibility ; whilst others minister to the gustative sense. (See Taste.) So it is probable that in all animals which have a soft fleshy tongue, furnished with pa- pillae, and serving as the organ of taste, this organ is the instrumentof tactilesensibility also. * The movements of these organs, or such as are excited through contact with them, can scarcely be in themselves regai'ded as a sufficient indication of their tactile sensibility, as they may be purely reflex, without involving consciousness of the impression.1167 TOUCH. Besides the papillary apparatus, however, we find certain animals endowed with special organs of touch, which are constructed upon a very different plan ; consisting of a rod or filament, which is in itself insensible, but which is connected at its base with nervous fibres, in such a manner that any motion or vibration communicated to it must be transmitted to them. Such are the long stiff' hairs which are known as the " whiskers" of the feline tribe, and which are so particularly large in the seal ; these are also highly deve- loped in many of the rodentia, such as the hare and rabbit; and it has been proved by experiment, that if they be cut off, the animal loses in great degree its power of guiding its movements in the dark. Thus Mr. Broughton found that whilst a kitten whose whiskers were entire was capable of threading its way blindfold out of a labyrinth in which it was designedly placed, it was totally unable to do so when its whiskers were cut off; for it then struck its head repeatedly against the sides, ran against all the corners, and tumbled over steps placed in its way, instead of avoiding them as it did prior to the loss of its whis- kers.* In animals whose hairs are their im- portant instruments of touch, a true papilla, copiously furnished with nerves and blood- vessels, is found to project into the bulb of each hair. The jointed appendages to the head, known as antenna; and palpi, which are possessed by most articulated animals, are un- doubtedly instruments of touch, whatever sensory impressions they may receive in addi- tion. The antennae, when prolonged, serve to guide the movements of the animal ; the impressions which they receive at their ex- tremities being communicated to the nerves at their base, just as a blind man judges by the stick held in his hand of the proximity of obstacles to his progress.f On the other hand, the palpi appear to minister to the cognisance of objects brought into the neighbourhood of the mouth, and to have for their chief office to guide in the selection of food. But while there are many facts which seem to indicate that the antennae minister to the sense of hearing, there are others which appear to point to the palpi as the special instruments of that of smell. Conditions of the Sense of Touch. — The sense of touch, strictly so called, is exercised under conditions essentially the same as those through which the general sensibility of the * London Medical and Physical Journal, 1823. f The author is acquainted with a blind gentle- man who exhibits a remarkable dexterity in the use of his stick in guiding his movements; and he has been informed by him, that much of his power of discrimination depends upon the flexibility, elasti- city, &c. of this instrument, so that, when he has chanced to lose or break the one to which he has been accustomed, it is often long before he can ob- tain another that shall suit him so well. This cir- cumstance seems to throw some light upon the re- makable varieties of conformation in the antenna; of insects; as it may well be imagined that each is adapted to receive and to communicate impressions of a particular class, adapted to the wants of the species. body is affected. It is requisite, in the first place, that the bodies, of whose'presence it takes cognisance, should be brought into actual contact with the tactile surface ; the only exception being in regard to the tempe- rature of objects, the influence of which may be communicated by radiations from a distance. This difference, however, does not indicate any fundamental diversity such as some have imagined to exist, between the sense of tem- perature and that of resistance ; for, in each case, that which is perceived by the mind is the impression made upon the sensory organ ; and the change in this is excited in the one case by pressure, and in the other by heat or cold. The same organ appears to be adapted to take cognisance of both classes of impres- sions ; a feeling of one kind being excited, when its condition is altered by pressure ; and a feeling of a different kind, when its tempe- rature has undergone a change under the in- fluence of calorific radiations. And the dif- ference between these classes of sensations is not greater than that which exists among others, — whether of a general or a special kind, — which we know to be transmitted by the same nerve-fibres. Yet it would seem that, whilst there is no sufficient reason for supposing impressions of contact and of tem- perature to be transmitted by different nerve- fibres, we must admit that some of these fibres, either in virtue of their own constitu- tion, of the locality of their central termina- tion, or of the apparatus with which they are furnished at their peripheral origin, are en- dowed with a greater readiness to receive and transmit one or the other class of impressions. For we find that the parts whose tactile sen- sibility is the most discriminating, are not always those by which the keenest apprecia- tion of changes of temperature is obtained. And, in like manner, the occasional occur- rence of cases of paralysis, in which there is a total loss of one kind of sensation, whilst the other is preserved, or in which one is di- minished beyond all proportion to the other, seems to show that such a change may take place in the nerve-fibres, as may indispose them to the reception and transmission of one class of impressions, whilst they are still capable of actively responding to the other. After what has been said of the necessity of the supply of blood, for the active exercise of common or general sensibility, and of the vas- cularity of the special tactile organs, it is not requisite to lay any further stress on this point, in relation to the sense of touch, strictly so called. Another important condition, w hich is probably common to the whole sensory apparatus of the warm-blooded animal, and which has been already noticed under the head of Taste, is a temperature not too far removed from that which is natural to the body. It has been shown by Professor E. H. Weber, that if the fingers or the hps be im- mersed for half a minute or a minute in water heated to 125°, or cooled to 32°, the power of tactile discrimination is so much impaired, that the power of distinguishing between a1168 TOUCH. hot or cold fluid or solid body is for the time completely lost, a feeling of pain alone being experienced, which is the same whether the body be hot or cold. This, too, he found to be the case, when, instead of applying the heat or cold to the peripheral extremities of the nerve, he acted on its trunk. For this ex- periment the ulnar nerve was selected, as its trunk, at the elbow, lies immediately beneath the surface. After immersing the elbow in a mixture of ice and water for about six- teen seconds, Professor Weber observed that a peculiar painful sensation was experienced along the under side of the fore-arm, the wrist, the little finger, and the inner side of the ring-finger. This pain had no resemblance to that of cold. On continuing the immersion, the pain increased considerably, and eventu- ally became almost intolerable ; then it gra- dually diminished, and the middle and ring- fingers became numb, as if " asleep," had no longer the power of distinguishing between heat and cold, and could only imperfectly per- ceive the contact and pressure of bodies. * The exercise of the sense of touch may be first considered under its simplest mode, namely, that in which the object is simply ap- plied to the tactile organ ; and in this we have specially to consider the power of Tactile Discrimination, and the Sense of Temperature. Tactile Discrimination. — A very ingenious method was devised by Professor Weber j", for determining the relative power of tactile dis- crimination in different parts of the skin, which is by no means accordant with their general sensibility. His mode of ascertaining this, was to touch the surface with the points of a pair of compasses, guarded by bits of cork or seal- ing-wax ; the eyes being closed at the same time, the legs of the compasses were approxU mated to each other; until they were brought so near that the points could be no longer felt to be distinct from each other. The smallest distance at which this can be perceived (en- titled "the limit of confusion," by Dr. Graves), is found to differ remarkably on different parts of the cutaneous surface; and the com- parison of these diversities affords us the means of estimating, — not their relative tactile sensibility (for this it cannot measure), — but their relative discriminating power. The figures in the first column of the following Table represent these distances, as determined by Professor Weber on his own person, stated in Paris tines. The inquiry has been more re- cently pursued by Professor Valentin j, whose results on the whole correspond very closely with those of Weber. He found, however, a considerable extent of individual variation; some persons being able to distinguish the points at half, or even one-third of the dis- tances required by others. In the following table, the second column expresses the maxima * Muller's Archiv. 1847, p. 342. f L»e Pulsu, Respiraticme, Auditu, et Tactu, An- notationes Anatomicae et Physiologicse. Auet. H. E.

S. 50G. of the "limit of confusion," the third column the minima, and the fourth column the mean of all the observations made by Professor Valen- tin ; it will be observed that his maxima cor- respond almost exactly with the measure- ments of Professor Weber on his own person. In the fifth and sixth columns are shown the relative acuteness and relative obtuseness of the discriminating sense in different parts, calculated from the mean results ; " the limit of confusion " (0-483) at the tip of the tongue being taken as l'OOO. Thus the co-efficient of the acuteness of the discriminating sense in the palm of the hand, calculated by this standard, is 0126; that of its obtuseness is 7-930. The co-efficient of acuteness for the crown of the head, is 0-050; that of obtuse- ness, for the same part, is 19-827. The co~ efficient of acuteness for the middle of the dorsal spine is 0-020 ; that of its obtuseness is 50-086. Or, in other words, its acuteness is only ^g^ths that of the tip of the tongue ; its obtuseness fifty times as great. Similar experiments, with the like results, have been made by M. H. Belfield-Lefevre* i and from all these, the following general pro- positions may be laid down :— 1. On almost any part of the integument, the interval between the two points is more clearly dis- tinguished, when the line which joins them is transverse (i. e. perpendicular to the axis of the body or member), than when it is longitudinal, or parallel to that axis. According to Weber, however, the tips of the fingers and of the tongue constitute an exception to this rule; the discriminating power being greatest in them, when the line joining the points of the com- passes is longitudinally directed. 2. When two points, applied simultaneously to any part of the integument, are clearly distin- guished, the distance which separates them seems to be greater, in proportion to the acute- ness of the discriminating sense in the part of the surface which is the subject of examina- tion. Thus, as Weber remarks, if the points of the compasses, set at a distance of two or three lines, be applied to the cheek just before the ear, and be then moved gradually towards the angle of the mouth, the points will seem to recede from one another, in consequence of the increase of the discriminating sense in the parts to which they are applied. 3. When the two points are successively brought into contact with the skin, they seem to be at a greater distance from each other than if they are simultaneously applied ; and, in general, the distance will seem greater in proportion to the interval between their application. 4. Two points applied on different sides of the median line, seem more remote from one another than two points equally distant, but applied on one and the same side of the median line ; in other words, the power of discrimination is greater when the two points are applied on the two sides of the median line, than when they are both applied on the same side. 5.

IV.TOUCH. 1170 selected, whose relative position is subject to variation (such as the two eyelids, the two lips, &c.), and the two points of the pair of compasses be applied respectively to these two surfaces, the distance which separates them will seem to be much greater than if the two points rest at the same time on one or the other surface. 6. The same holds good, ac- cording to Weber, when the two points are applied to parts of the surface, which, though in continuity with each other, differ remark- ably, either in structure, in function, or in the use habitually made of them ; thus, the points will be more clearly distinguishable, and will therefore seem to be more distant from each other, when one is applied to the inner surface and the other to the red outer surface of the lips, than when they are both applied to the latter, although its discriminating power is much greater than that of the former; and the same holds good of the margin and dorsum of the tongue, the palmar and dorsal surfaces of the last phalanges of the fingers, &c 7. The discriminating sense is more acute in the in- terments of the head, than in those of the trunk ; and on the face, its acuteness di- minishes as the distance from the mouth in- creases. 8. The tactile discrimination of the integuments of the limbs augments with the distance of the part from the axis of the body; it is less in the integuments of the trunk, than in those of the members. The power of tactile discrimination may be conceived to depend in part upon the mode in which the ultimate nerve-fibres are dis- tributed in the skin, being greater in propor- tion as contiguous parts are supplied from distinct central sources, and less when the central terminations of their nerve-tubes are the same. Thus, if two impressions be made along the course of the same nerve-tube, they will not be felt as two, but as one , and this probably holds good of the parts of the in- tegument supplied with branches from the central axis of any one tube. On the other hand, whenever two impressions be made upon two distinct nerve-tubes, or on the branches proceeding from them, they will probably be felt to be double; ami the dis- tance at which these impressions seem to the tactile sense to be, appears to have a relation to the distinctness of the central connections of these nerve-tubes, as appears from the fact that the " limit of confusion " is less across the median line than on either side of it ; that it is less between two parts (such as the lips and eyelids) whose nervous supply is known to be distinct, than on either part separately ; and that it is less between two parts whose nervous supply may be presumed, from their difference of function, to be dis- tinct (as the inner and outer surfaces of the lips), than on either part separately. More- ever, it would not seem to be improbable that one use of the plexuses from which the limbs are supplied, is to produce such an inter- mingling of the fibres from different gan- glionic centres, that contiguous portions of the integument shall be connected with cen- tres very remote from each other, and their discriminating power thus augmented. No such intermingling takes place in the nerves which supply the trunk, and the tactile dis- crimination of its integument is (as we have seen) vastly inferior to that of the extremities. Thus it may happen that the common sensi- bility of two parts may be the same, whilst their power of tactile discrimination may differ considerably; and we may even have the common sensibility greatest where the tactile discrimination is least, — as we experience, for example, on the integument of the face, which is far more sensitive to a blow, and especially to a " fillip," than is the integument of the palmar surface of the fingers, although greatly inferior to them in discriminating power. The actual nervous supply, and the conse* quent sensibility, of a part, may be greater in such cases ; but the unity, or close approxi- mation, of the source from which this pro- ceeds, may prevent its discriminating power from augmenting in the same proportion. In like manner, we find that the tactile dis- crimination of different parts bears no relation whatever to that peculiar modification of common sensibility (which yet appears the exclusive attribute of the external integuments) through which the feeling of "tickling" is excited. For the parts which are most sus- ceptible to this feeling, such as the axilla; and the soles of the feet, are possessed of a very low degree of discriminating power, and those which possess this power in the highest degree (such as the tips of the fingers) are the least " ticklish." Further, it is worthy of notice that the parts through which that peculiar sensation, which we have termed the genital sense, is specially excited,—namely, the penis and the mammary areola,— are remark- able rather for the obtuseness than for the acuteness of their power of tactile discrimina- tion. That it is only through the skin and those parts of its internal reflexions which are in closest proximity with it (especially the lining of the mouth and nostrils), that we can dis- criminate tactile impressions, appears from this; that although the internal mucous and serous surfaces, the fibrous membranes, and the parenchyma of many organs, &c. &c, are all capable of becoming acutely sensible to pain when irritated or inflamed, yet no foreign substance is ever distinctly felt by the touch through these parts. Thus, although a sensation of a pleasing or a painful nature is excited by certain substances immediately upon being swallowed, all consciousness of their presence (so far as it is dependent upon the sense of touch) soon ceases, and cannot be again recalled by the utmost exertion of the will. Further, a foreign substance, lodged in the alimentary canal, or in the trachea, may give rise to the greatest possible distress, through the irritation it produces ; but though it thus acts upon the nerves of the parts im- mediately in contact with it, these nerves convey no idea to the sufferer of the shape or size of the body, or of any other of its1171 TOUCH. 4 F 2 physical qualities, concerning which we re- ceive information through the sense of touch. Sense of Temperature. — This sense is called into action when there is a difference between the temperature of the sensory organ and that of the surrounding medium, or of substances with which it is specially brought into contact. It is one of which the intensity is determined, more perhaps than that of any other sensation, rather by the relative than by the absolute condition of the body which excites it. Thus, if one hand be immersed for a time in hot water, and the other in cold, and both then be plunged into tepid water, this will seem cool to the former and warm to the latter. So, again, a person coining out of cold air into an atmosphere of moderate tem- perature, derives from it the feeling of genial warmth, whilst another, coming into the very same atmosphere from one much hotter, com- plains of its chillness. Again, when the tem- perature of different substances is compared by the hand, the sense is not so much influ- enced by the absolute amount of caloric possessed by each, as by their power of imparting cold or heat to the sensory organ. Hence substances which are good conductors (such as metals or marble) are felt to be colder than those which conduct heat badly (such as wood), although really of the same temperature, because they draw off the heat of the sensory surface more rapidly ; whilst, on the other hand, if both be warmer than the sensory surface, the best conductors will seem to be the hottest, because their caloric is most readily imparted. Further, the sense of temperature is influenced in a remarkable degree by the extent of surface on which the impression is made. Every one is familiar with the fact that hot water in which a single finger may be held without inconvenience, will be felt intolerably scalding when the whole hand is immersed in it. And it has been shown by Professor Weber, that if one vessel of water be heated to 98° and another to 104°, and the whole of the hand be im- mersed in the former, while the finger alone is immersed in the latter, a wrong judgment of their relative temperatures will be probably given, that which is really the cooler being pronounced the hotter, on account of the larger extent of surface on which it acts. This mistake was made in some of his experi- ments, when the difference was as much as eight degrees ; the cooler water being at 98°, and the hotter at 106°, and yet the former being esteemed the hotter. So, again, the immersion of the entire hand enables minute differences of temperature to be detected, which could not be recognised by the immer- sion of a single finger. By the former method, a difference of only one-third of a degree may be distinguished; the entire hand being im- mersed, repeatedly and successively, in two vessels of water, differing only that much in their relative warmth. But it is remarked by Professor Weber, that these minute differ- ences are best detected when the medium examined does not fall short of, or exceed very considerably, the usual temperature of the body ; just as the car can best perceive a difference of tone in sounds which are neither very acute or very grave.* It is a remarkable fact, discovered by Pro- fessor Weber, that the left hand is in most persons more sensible to variations of tem- perature than the right. Thus, when the hands of a person lying in bed, and having exactly the same temperature, are plunged each in a separate vessel of hot water, the left hand is believed to be in the hotter medium, although the water in which it is immersed is really one or two degrees colder than the other. This difference is the more remarkable, as the power of tactile discrimina- tion is usually greater in the right hand ; and it is attributed by Professor Weber to a difference in the thickness of the epidermis, the left hand usually having a thinner epi- dermis than the right, especially in the palm, because it is less used. But this will only apply to the hand; and since (as will be presently shown) we possess a greater power of discriminating pressures through the entire surface of the left side than through that of the right, it would seem much more pro- bable that there is an original difference in the tactile endowments of the two sides respectively. There is certainly a strongly marked difference between different parts of the trunk in regard to their sensibility to tem- perature, as is experienced by those who sponge themselves over with cold water im- mediately on leaving their bed in the morning. In the writer's case, the parts most sensitive to the cold are in the centre of the dorsal region behind; in front, between the lower end of the sternum and the umbilicus ; and the corresponding portions of the flanks. These spots are among the parts of the in- tegument least possessed of tactile discrimi- nation ; and yet the cold sponge passing over them seems to be much lower in temperature than when it is applied to other parts. Some further experiments have recently been made by Professor Weber, to determine whether the sense of temperature is received through any other channel than the sensory apparatus contained in the integuments.+ The first means of which he availed himself for deciding this question, was that afforded by the results of accident or surgical operations, in which a portion of skin has been left defi- cient. Thus, in three cases in which a large portion of the skin had been destroyed by a burn, and in which healing had not advanced so far as to renew the organ of touch, it was found that no correct discrimination could be made between two spatulas, one of them at a temperature of from 48° to 54°, the other of from 113° to 122°, which were brought into * He further remarks, that the comparison be- tween two temperatures can be best made when the impressions are not simultaneously made upon two different parts, but are made in quick succession upon the same part; as mentioned hereafter to be the case in regard to weights. t Miiller's Archiv. 1849. Heft, iv. s. 273—283.1172 TOUCH. contact with the denuded surface; so that one of these patients thrice affirmed that he was being touched with the cold body when it was the warm, and the reverse. But when the spatula was in one instance made some- what warmer, and was brought into contact with the unskinned surface, the patient felt, not heat but pain. Another means of gaining information on this point is afforded by the ingestion or injection of a large quantity of warm or cold fluid into the stomach or intes- tinal canal. Thus Professor Weber states, that after drinking a tumbler of water at 32°, he felt the cold water in the mouth, in the palate, and in the pharynx, as far as the limits of the sense of touch ; but that the gradual passage of the cold water into the stomach could not be perceived. There was, it is true, a slight sensation of cold in the gastric region; but as it only occupied the situation of the anterior wall of the stomach, it was at- tributable to the abstraction of heat from the abdominal integuments in contact with this. In an opposite experiment, the author drank quickly three glasses of milk, the temperature of the first of which was 158°, that of the second 145°, whilst that of the third was in- termediate between the two. The sensation of heat could not be traced lower down than that of the cold in the previous experiment. At the moment when the fluid entered the stomach, there was a feeling which remained for some time, but which could not be dis- tinguished as heat, being mistakeable for cold. In order to ascertain the sensations produced in the large intestine by cold water, an in- jection of 14ozs. of water of the temperature of 65° was thrown up the rectum, but scarcely any sensation of cold could be perceived from it. In another instance, 21 ozs. of water at the same temperature was thrown up, without any resulting sensation of cold. In both these cases, on the return of the enema a few mi- nutes afterwards, a distinct feeling of cold was experienced at the anus. When water of so low a temperature as 45i° was injected, the first feeling excited was a sensation of cold in the immediate neighbourhood of the anus, and then a feeble movement in the bowels ; but a little time afterwards, there was a faint sensa- tion of cold, especially in the anterior wall of the abdomen. This sensation, however, re- mained after the return of the water ; and may hence be attributed to the abstraction of warmth from the abdominal integuments, which was proved to take place, the temper- ature of the surface being lowered 3 degrees. So, again, if the cavity of the nose be filled with cold water, the coldness is only perceived in the parts of the cavity which are most en- dowed with the proper tactile sense, namely, the neighbourhood of the nostrils and of the pharynx ; and it is not at all discernible in the higher part of the cavity, which is espe- cially subservient to the olfactive sense. [See Smell.] But when the water injected is very cold (e. g. 41°), a peculiar pain is felt in the upper part of the nasal fossae, extending to the regions of the forehead and lachrymal canals; this pain, however, is altogether dif- ferent from the sense of coldness. From the foregoing experiments it appears fair to conclude, that the sensory nerves have no power of receiving impressions arising from difference of temperature, unless those im- pressions are communicated through a special organ ; but they afford no adequate ground for the supposition, that a set of nerve-fibres is provided for their transmission, distinct from those which minister to common sensation. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact, that we cannot excite impressions of heat or cold by direct application to the trunks of nerves which we know must conduct such impres- sions. Thus the parts of the skin immediately beneath which lie large nerve-trunks, are not more sensitive to moderate heat or cold than any other part ; whilst a greater degree of either is felt as pain, not as a change of tem- perature. Thus, as we have already seen, a mixture of ice and water, applied over the ulnar nerve, affects it in fifteen seconds, and produces severe pain, having no resemblance to cold, such as cannot be excited by the same cold applied to any other region. So the nerve of the tooth-pulp is equally and similarly affected by water of 43° and of 112°; either application causing a pain exactly similar to that excited by the other, or that produced by pressure.* We have now to consider those more com- plex modes of exercise of the sense of touch which require the conjoint exercise of the " muscular sense;" and as this is a modifi- cation of the general sensibility, which may perhaps be regarded as being as special or peculiar in its relations to the muscular sys- tem as the sense of touch (properly so called) is to that of the skin,jit will be desirable to examine, in the first instance, into its modus ojterandi. Muscular Sense. — It may be stated as a general fact, that all voluntary muscular con- traction must be guided and controlled by sen- sation ; and in the majority of cases, the con- trolling sensation is derived from the muscles themselves, of whose condition we are ren- dered cognisant by the sensory nerves with which they are furnished. The proof of this necessity is furnished by the entire want of power to make or sustain voluntary efforts, when the guiding sensation is deficient. Thus, in complete anaesthesia of the lower extre- mities, without loss of muscular power, the patient is as completely unable to walk, as if the motor nerves had also been paralysed, unless the deficient sensorial guidance be re- placed by some other ; and in similar affections of the upper extremities, there is a like in- ability to raise the limb or to sustain a weight. But in such cases, the deficiency of the " mus- * It is remarkable that the same should be true of the impressions received through the skin itself, when they pass beyond certain limits of intensity; thus, the sensation produced by touching frozen mercury is said to be not distinguishable from that which results from touching a red-hot iron.1173 TOUCH. 4 F 3 cular sense" may be made good by the visual; thus, the patient who cannot walk, because he cannot feel either the contact of his foot with the ground, or the muscular effort he is mak- ing, can do so if lie looks at his limbs ; and the woman who cannot feel the pressure of her child upon her arms, can yet sustain it as long as she keeps her eyes fixed upon it, but no longer, — the muscles ceasing to contract, and the limb dropping powerless, the moment that the eyes are withdrawn from it. There are two groups of muscular actions, however, which, although as voluntary in their character as the foregoing, are yet habitually guided by other sensations than those derived from the muscles themselves. These are, the move- ments of the eyeball, and those of the vocal apparatus. The former are directed (as Dr. Alison has well shown *) by the visual sense, by which the action of the muscles is guided and controlled in the same manner as that of other muscles is directed by their own " mus- cular sense ;" and hence it happens that, when we close our eyes, we cannot move them in any required direction, without an effort that strongly calls forth the muscular sense, by which the action is then guided. In persons who have become blind after having once enjoyed sight, an association is formed by habit between the muscular sense and the con- tractile action, that enables the former to serve as the guide after the loss of the visual sense ; but in those who are born perfectly blind, or who have become so in early infancy, this association is never formed, and the eyes of such persons exhibit a continued indefinite movement, and cannot by any amount of effort be steadily fixed in one spot, or be turned in any definite direction. A very small amount of the visual sense, however, such as serves merely to indicate the direction of light, is sufficient for the government of the move- ments of the eye-ball. In the production of vocal sounds, again, that nice adjustment of the muscles of the larynx, which is requisite to give forth deter- minate tones, is ordinarily directed by the auditory sense; being learned in the first instance under the guidance of the sounds actually produced ; but being subsequently effected voluntarily, in accordance with the mental conception (a sort of inward sensa- tion) of the tone to be uttered, which concep- tion cannot be formed, unless the sense of hearing has previously brought similar tones to the mind. Hence it is that persons who are born deaf, are also dumb. They may have no malformation of the organs of speech ; but they are incapable of uttering distinct vocal sounds or musical tones, because they have not the guiding conception, or recalled sensation, of the nature of these. By long training, however, and by imitative efforts directed by the muscular sense of the larynx itself, some persons thus circumstanced have acquired the power of speech ; but the want * Anatomical and Physiological Inferences from the Study of the Nerves of the Orbit, in Trans, of Roy. Soc. Edinb., vol. xv. of a sufficiently definite control over the vocal muscles is always very evident in their use of the organ. It is very rarely that a person who has once enjoyed the sense of hearing, afterwards becomes so completely deaf, as to lose all auditory control over his vocal organs. An example of this kind, however, has been made known to the public by a well known author, as having occurred in himself; and the record of his experiences* contains many points of much interest. The deafness was the result of an accident occurring in child- hood, which left him for some time in a state of extreme debility; and when he made the attempt to speak, it was with considerable pain in the vocal organs. This pain probably- resulted from the unaccustomed effort which it was necessary to make, when the usual guidance was wanting; being analogous to the uneasiness which we experience when we attempt to move our eyes with the lids closed. His voice at that time is described as being very similar to that of a person born deaf and dumb, but who has been taught to speak. With the uneasiness in the use of the vocal organs was associated an extreme mental in- disposition to their employment; and thus, for some years, the voice was very little ex- ercised. Circumstances afterwards forced it, however, into constant employment; and great improvement has subsequently taken place in the power of vocalisation, evidently by atten- tion to the indications of the muscular sense. It is a curious circumstance, fully confirming this view, that the words which had been in use previously to the supervention of the deafness, are still pronounced (such of them, at least, as are kept in employment) as they were in childhood ; the muscular movements concerned in their articulation being still guided by the original auditory conception, in spite of the knowledge derived from the in- formation of others, that their pronunciation is erroneous. On the other hand, all the words subsequently learned are pronounced according to their spelling; the acquired as- sociations between the muscular sensations and the written signs being in this case the obvious guide. The perception of "effort" which we derive through the impressions made on the muscular sense, is one which, as we shall presently see, is of immense value, in com- bination with simple tactile sensation, in informing us of the sensible properties of external objects. In its simplest exercise, however, it enables us to appreciate the degree of muscular force which is being exerted ; and excites in our minds our most definite idea of power. It is true that we might, by the ex-ercise of our other senses, have arrived at the conception of a tendency in bodies to attract one another, or to com- municate motion one to another ; but the notion of the force with which they do so is entirely founded, directly or indirectly, upon * See the " Lost Senses," by Dr. Kitto; vol. i. chapters 2 and 3.TOUCH. 1174 * Outlines of Physiology, p. 355. * Lo.o. cit. the conception of the muscular exertion which would be required to produce or to antagonise the movement. Thus it is, too. that when we are about to make a muscular effort, the amount of force which we put forth is governed by the mental conception of that whicb will be required, as indicated by the experience of former sensations ; just as the contractions of the muscles of vocalisa- tion are regulated by the conception of the sound to be produced. Hence if the weight be unknown to us, and it prove either much heavier or much lighter than was expected, we find that we have put forth too little or too great a muscular effort. It is through the " muscular sense," in combination with the visual and tactile, that those movements are regulated, which are concerned alike in ordinary progression, and in the maintenance of the equilibrium of the bod\'. That the visual sense has, in most persons, a large share in this regulation, is evident from the simple fact that no one who has not been accustomed [to the deprivation of it can continue to walk straightforwards, when blind-folded, or in absolute darkness, towards any point in the direction of which he may have been at first guided. But the blind man, who has been accustomed to rely exclusively upon his muscular sense, has no difficulty in keeping to a straight path ; and moves onwards with a confidence which is in remarkable contrast with the gait of a man who has been deprived of sight for the oc- casion only. In fact, as Mr. Mayo has well remarked *, in our ordinary movements, " we lean upon our eyesight as upon crutches." And when our vision, instead of aiding and guiding us, brings to the mind sensations of an antagonistic character, our movements become uncertain, from the loss of that power of guidance and control over them which the harmony of the two sensations usually gives. Thus a person unaccustomed to look down heights feels insecure at the top of a tower or a precipice, although he knows that his body is properly supported ; for the void which he sees below him contradicts (so to speak) the tactile sensations by which he is made conscious of the due equilibrium of his body. So, again, any one can walk along a narrow plank which forms part of the floor of a room, or which is elevated but a little above it, without the least difficulty, and even without any consciousness of effort. But let that plank extend across a chasm, the bottom of which is so far removed from the eye that the visual sense gives no assistance ; and even those who have braced their nerves against all emotional distraction feel that an effort is requisite to maintain the equilibrium during the passage over it;—that effort being aided by the withdrawal of the eyes from the abyss below, and the fixation of them on a point beyond, which at the same time helps to give steadiness to the move- ments, and distracts the mind from the sense of its danger. The degree in which the muscular sense is alone sufficient for the guidance of such movements, when the mind has no consciousness of the danger, and when the visual sense neither affords aid nor contributes to distract the attention, is re- markably illustrated by the phenomena of Somnambulism; for the sleep-walker traverses, without the least hesitation, the narrow para- pet of a house, and crosses narrow and insecure planks, chambers, roofs, &c, under circum- stances that clearly indicate the nature of the guidance by which they are directed (see Sleep, p. 69-f). The dependence of our ordinary power of maintaining our equili- brium upon the combination of the guiding sensations derived through the sight and the touch, is further well illustrated, as Mr. Mayo has pointed out *, by what happens to a landsman on first going to sea. " It is long before the passenger acquires his ' sea legs.' At first, as the ship moves, he can hardly keep his feet; the shifting lines of the vessel and surface of the water unsettle his visual stability; the different inclinations of the planks he stands on, his muscular sense. In a short time, he learns to disregard the shift- ing images and changing motions, or acquires facility in adapting himself (like one on horseback) to the different alterations in the line of direction in his frame." Before this power, however, has been gained, the pas- senger has usually to experience most dis- tressingly that peculiar feeling of want of support, which is consequent upon the pitch- ing and rolling of the ship, but more par- ticularly upon the formers As the part of the vessel on which he is standing, sitting, or lying, rises beneath him, there is a comfortable sense of support; but as it sinks, the want of support is most disagreeably felt ; and the continual repetition of this sensation gives rise to nausea and vomiting. The tendency is increased by the sight of continually shifting lines and surfaces, which of itself, with many individuals, disposes to the same state; and hence it is that the sickness may often be kept at bay by simply closing the eyes, so as to exclude these objects ; whilst, on the other hand, the effort to stand or walk only serves to augment the distress, by increasing the sense of instability. — The giddiness and nausea produced by rapidly turning round, are the results of the same sensations. They are usually excited more through the visual than through the tactile sense ; but that the latter is of itself quite sufficient to produce them, is obvious from the fact that they are experienced when the eyes are closed, as well as by blind persons. The feeling of disturbed equilibrium is more persistent than most other sensations ; thus when a person has turned round quickly several times in suc- cession, and then suddenly stops, he feels a whirling sensation, which excites a disposition to continued motion in his limbs, and the surrounding objects appear to move beforeTOUCH. 1175 4 f 4. his eyes. But if, as Mr. Wheatstone has pointed out, the person who is turning round holds a large sheet of paper before and near his face, so as to exclude all sight of the room, and fixes his eyes upon a point — a letter, for instance, in the middle of the paper, — when he stops, he finds his iiead perfectly steady, and the surrounding objects have no apparent motion ; but his legs feel unsteady, as if they continued actually turn- ing round. And it is thus clearly proved that the cause of the giddiness lies in the affection of the senses, and not (as is usually imagined) in disturbed cerebral action. Sense of Weight. — This is usually derived from a double source; namely, the impression made upon the cutaneous surface by the sim- ple pressure of the body: and the conscious- ness of the muscular effort employed to re- sist that pressure. The latter enables us to compare the weights of different bodies much more accurately than the former, which is li- able to excite fallacious ideas. The extent of surface, for example, which is in contact with the skin, greatly modifies the estimate of the pressure of a heavy body ; the body feeling lightest when its pressure is distributed over a larger surface, and vice versa. Thus, a trun- cated cone seems heavier when it rests (with- out any effort being made to raise or support it) upon its small extremity, than when it rests upon its large extremity on the same part of the surface. At first sight this fact appears altogether antagonistic to the one just stated with regard to the sense of temperature, the impressions on which are more powerful when they are made over a large than over a small surface. But it is to be borne in mind, that in the latter case an absolutely larger amount of calorific influence is exerted, when the large surface is exposed to the action of heat; whilst in the former, the amount of pressure is really the same, whether it be distributed over a larger or a smaller area. The experi- ments of Weber on the relative information derived from the mere sense of pressure, and from the sense of muscular effort, in the ap- preciation of weights, are very instructive. He found that if the two hands of the same individual be placed upon cushions, and un- equal weights be placed upon the right and left hands respectively, the eyes being kept shut, it will not be possible to say on which hand the heavier weight lies, unless the dif- ference be very considerable ; but a compara- tively small amount of difference is at once dis- criminated, when a muscular effort is made to lift the hands from the cushions. This power of comparison is capable of being rendered more exact by practice; so that men accus- tomed to estimate weights by poising them in their hands, will readily distinguish between two which differ only by one-thirtieth part. It is found that the power of comparison is much greater (as in the estimation of tempe- rature) when the impressions are successively, than when they are simultaneously made, pro- vided that the interval be not too long. Thus in the comparison of two weights, the greatest nicety is attained by poising the one, and immediately afterwards the other, in the same hand ; but the intervention of a few seconds between the poising of the first and that of the second does not prevent their accurate com- parison. The interval may amount to twenty seconds, and yet a just estimate may still be made; but when it amounts to forty seconds all accuracy is lost. Professor Weber has further ascertained, that, in the estimation of weights by their simple pressure on the sur- face, the left side and extremities have usually a more acute perception than the right; for out of fourteen individuals, he found this to be the case in eleven; in two, the contrary was observed ; whilst in one, no difference was perceptible. Sense of Direction. — The combination of the muscular with the simply tactile sense enables us also to judge in some degree of the direction of the pressure. Of this we gain no information whatever from the tactile sense alone, which always suggests the idea that the pressure is made vertically to the surface, when it is not corrected by the sense of mus- cular effort called forth to antagonise it. The following example, given by Weber, shows how completely involuntary may be this effort, yet how large a share it has in communicating to us the information we derive from an im- pression, of whose direction we are rendered cognisant. When a hair of the head is pulled, he remarks, we can judge perfectly well of the direction of the traction; this power of discrimination is not, however, derived (as might at first be supposed) through the sen- sation originating in the bulb of the hair, but from the sense of the muscular effort which is called forth to antagonise the traction, and to keep the head steady during its continuance. If we prevent these muscles from being called into play, by steadily holding between the hands the head of the person operated on, and if we also prevent the traction from call- ing forth the muscular action of the scalp, by surrounding the point from which the hair is pulled with a firm pressure by the fingers, we find that the discriminating power is completely lost ; the subject of the experi- ment being totally unable to distinguish the direction from which the hair is pulled. It is by this combination, too, that we judge of the rate and direction of the passive motion of our bodies, when we have no other means of guidance. If, for example, a person be seated in a carriage, with his eyes closed, and the carriage be suddenly put in motion, the inertia of his body causes it to be thrown in the contrary direction ; and, in order to re- cover and sustain its equilibrium, a muscular effort is required, which is greater in propor- tion to the rate of motion. If the motion continue uniform, however, this effort becomes so habitual that he ceases to be conscious of it; and he only becomes cognisant of the mo- tion by its cessation, the equilibrium of the body being then again disturbed by its inertia, which tends to impel it in the direction in which it was previously moving, so as to re-TOUCH. 1176 * Outlines of Physiology, 3rd ed. p. 290. intuitive connection between the ideas which quire the effort of a contrary set of muscles for the maintenance of the erect position. Mental Phenomena connected ivith the Sense. — The interpretation which the mind puts upon the impressions made by external ob- jects upon the tactile organs, is partly the re- sult of intuition, partly of experience. Thus we intuitively refer an impression made upon any part of a sensory nerve in its course, to the peripheral extremities of that nerve, or (as in cases of amputation) to the part from which they should normally arise. So, again, if a part of the body be removed from its usual position and connections (as in the Taliacotian and various other operations of plastic surgery), impressions made upon it continue to be referred to its original seat, so long as it retains any nervous connection with it, and until new connections have been formed with the nerves of the part to which it has been transferred. So, again, when our members are in an unaccustomed position, we still, unless our attention be directed to the fact, interpret impressions made upon them as if they were in their ordinary relation to each other, and may thus be altogether misled : — as in the experiment mentioned by Aristotle, of rolling a pea or other globular body between two fingers of one hand, which are crossed instead of lying parallel, so that the surfaces that are usually most distant are brought into proximity with each other ; the sensation then received is that of a dis- tinct convex body opposed to each of these surfaces, so that the single body seems to be double; whereas, if the pea were rolled be- tween the two surfaces which are usually and normally approximated, it is felt but as a single globe. This intuitive reference is obviously analogous to that by which we judge of the relative situations of visual objects, from the direction in which their rays impinge upon the retina, or from the muscular sensations re- ceived from the muscles of the orbit. In a large proportion of other cases, how- ever, our interpretation of our tactile sensa- tions, especially of all those which relate to the configuration, density, &c. of external ob- jects, is based on experience ; and those who watch the eagerness with which the infant grasps and examines by its touch every attrac- tive object within its reach, are at no loss to perceive how the experience thus early inter- woven (as it were) with the mind, in combin- ation with that derived through the visual sense, comes to supply the place of the con- genital intuitions of the lower animals, and to cause the tactile and visual perceptions to be henceforth so indelibly associated, that each is continually suggesting the other. Thus, the notion of projection, which we derive through the sight, comes to be associated with that of solidity, which we receive through the touch ; and the visual notion of polish is so closely connected with the tactile notion of smoothness, that the one almost necessarily suggests the other. There is abundant evi- dence, however, that there is no necessary or we derive through these two senses respec- tively ; but that this connection is acquired by the consentaneous exercise of them. Thus, from observations made upon persons born blind, when visual power has been first ob- tained, it is certain that the notions of form previously acquired by the touch do not aid in the visual discrimination or recognition of objects : so that, for example, if any such person had previously learned to distinguish a sphere, a cube, and a pyramid, by the touch, he would not be able to say which was which by looking at them, until he had learned by experience to associate the two classes of per- ceptions : and, conversely, we cannot but be- lieve that the same result would occur, if a person whose notions of the external world were derived from the sight alone, were sud- denly and for the first time to become en- dowed with the sense of touch. It is, in fact, no less clear in regard to the sense of touch than it is in regard to vision, that it is not the sentient organ (as we are accustomed to term it), but the mind, which really perceives ; and that all the notions which we derive through this sense with re- spect to external objects, whether they be of the most general kind or of a more particular nature, are altogether distinct from the sensa- tions themselves. It has been well remarked by Professor Alison, that " one decisive proof of this being the true representation of this part of our mental constitution is obtained by attending to the idea of extension or space, which is undoubtedly formed during the exer- cise of the sense of touch, but which is no sooner formed than it ' swells in the human mind to infinity,' to which, certainly, no human sensation can bear any resemblance."* So, again, the elementary notion of an ex- ternal universe as something distinct from the individual self, is altogether distinct from the sensations which excites it. All that the mind is conscious of, is a change in the condi- tion of the corporeal organism ; and the re- ference of the source of this change to some external agency is a mental process in which the action of the purely sensorial apparatus has no concern. It has been thought by some that the notion of an external world depends more upon the sensations received through the touch, than upon those of any other kind. But there does not seem to the author to be any reason for considering that simply tactile impressions are more necessarily or intuitively recognised as proceeding from an external source than are the visual, olfactive, auditory, or gustative. But, as already shown, it is from the muscular sense that we derive the idea of force, involv- ing resistance to our own voluntary efforts; and it would seem to the writer to be on this notion that our belief in the existence of an universe external to ourselves most securely rests. The active co-operation of the mind is re- quired, not only for the formation of the1177 TOUCH. notions so immediately springing from sensa- tions as to be often confounded with them, but also for the reception of the sensory impres- sions themselves. Until, in fact, the mind has been affected by these impressions, no sensation can be said to exist ; and that of which the mind takes cognisance is not the external object but the impression produced by it, and not the direct or immediate impres- sion produced by it upon the organ which first receives it, but the change in the senso- rium consequent upon this. (See Sensa- tion.) That this is the true account of the process is now universally admitted both by the psychologist and the physiologist ; and it is placed beyond all reasonable question by the occurrence of those subjective sensations, which, until their indications are corrected by experience, may suggest the idea of an external source, with such vividness and de- finiteness, that the objective unreality can scarcely be credited. In some instances the excitement of these subjective sensations ap- pears due to the occurrence of a change in the part in which they are felt, which simu- lates that which would be produced by an external impression ; as in the case of the sen- sation of extreme heat, which is often expe- rienced in inflammation to a degree far beyond that which the actual exaltation of tempera- ture would account for ; and the pain, of va- rious kinds, often resembling that inflicted by external injuries, which is the result of morbid changes in the part to which it is referred. But in other cases they are clearly referable to changes taking place in the course of the nerve-trunk to the sensorium, which simulate those which would naturally occur in it when it is the conductor of an external impression ; of this several examples have already been given. Or, again, the}' may be due to a change purely sensorial; as in the various cases of " radiation of sensations " elsewhere alluded to (see Sensation); or, as in the sensations of nausea, of shuddering, of tickling, of pain, &c, which are frequently excited by changes purely mental. The degree of intensity, again, with which actual sensations are felt, depends as much upon the state of the mind as upon that of the corporeal organism. Thus, if we experience a slight itching in the skin, and direct our thoughts to it, we are speedily annoyed by its increase ; whilst, if we steadily fix our thoughts upon some other object, we are soon unconscious of the irritation. On the other hand, the complete absorption of the mind in some train of thought which engrosses its attention, may render the individual unconscious of impres- sions that would ordinarily induce severe pain. This is remarkably seen in cases of natural and artificial somnambulism (see Sleep) ; and it is probable that in many of the cases in which insane patients have in- flicted severe wounds upon themselves, with- out appearing to feel pain, the cause of the immunity from suffering is to be found in the entire possession which some dominant feel- ing or idea has of their consciousness, so that they are not cognizant of any external im- pressions but such as harmonize with it. Even in ordinary cases, it is well known that a severe injury suddenly inflicted, is much less felt at the moment than a far slighter injury of which the mind has been in expec- tation ; thus, a limb has been carried away by a cannon-ball, or the chest traversed by a bullet, with far less consciousness of pain than is produced by the trivial incision made in ordinary venesection. Improvea/ji/iti/ of the Sense of Touch. — The mental participation in the phenomena of tactile sensation is further rendered obvious by the improvement in discriminating power which results from continual attention to its indications. Of this we have examples in the case of certain artisans, whose employments re- quire them to cultivate their tactile discrimina- tion ; thus, the female silk-throwsters of Bengal are said to be able to distinguish by the touch alone twenty different degrees of fineness in the unwound cocoons, which are sorted ac- cordingly ; and the Indian muslin-weaver con- trives, by the delicacy of his touch, to make the finest cambric in a loom of such simple construction, that European fingers could at best propose to make a piece of canvas in it. The improvement in tactile discrimination is more especially seen, however, in those indi- viduals whose dependence upon it is increased by the loss or deficiency of other senses; and especially by blindness, congenital or ac- quired. Whilst it is doubtless to be attri- buted, in great part, to the concentration of the attention and of the powers of recollec- tion and comparison upon the sensations which are brought (as it were) to the mind, it may not seem altogether improbable that the improvement may in part depend upon an increased development of the tactile organs themselves ; resulting from that augmented nutrition which would be the natural con- sequence of the frequent use of them, and of the increased flow of blood that seems to take place towards any part on which the attention is continually fixed. Certain it is, that many blind persons can not merely obtain as defi- nite and accurate conceptions of the form, surface, &c, of objects over which they ra- pidly pass their hands, as others could only derive from the long and painstaking examin- ation of them by their tactile organs; but they can discriminate minute differences, of which those who have not specially cultivated this faculty remain quite unconscious, even when their attention is pointedly directed to their discovery. The process by which the blind learn to read from books printed in an ele- vated type for their special use, affords an interesting illustration of the nature of the improveability of the proper sense of touch. On first making the attempt, the learner needs to use a large type; and even although (to a person who has previously enjoyed his sight), the visual form of each letter may be well known, yet considerable experience is required for the ready recognition of the tactile form of each separate letter. After this step has been1178 TOUCH. gained, the individual becomes able, by a fur- ther period of diligent application, to recog- nise the combination of letters in syllables and words, without forming a separate idea of each letter, just as we see to take place in the child learning to read by eyesight ; and the pupil in time acquires the power of read- ing line after line, by passing the point of the finger consecutively over each, with consider- able rapidity. Now when this power has once been thoroughly acquired, it is found that the size of the type may be gradually diminished, so that at last it may be reduced to one but little larger than that of an ordi- nary folio Bible, which is read at least as rapidly as the words can be spoken.* As an instance of the readiness and nicety of dis- crimination which is frequently acquired by those who are chiefly dependent upon this sense for their knowledge of the outward world, we may advert to the well-known case of Laura Bridgman ; who, though destitute of sight, hearing, and smell, is able to recognise individuals with whom she has once been well acquainted, by feeling their hands, even after a long distance of time. It is related of Carolan.the celebrated blind Irish bard, that on accidentally grasping, at an interval of some years, the hand of a female to whom he had been formerly attached, he at once exclaimed, with strong emotion, " This is the hand of Bridget Cruise." A lady, who became blind, and soon afterwards deaf and dumb, in conse- quence of an attack of confluent small-pox, and whose case is recorded in the Annual Register for 1758, seems to have very speedily acquired a remarkable exaltation of the sensibility she retained. Like James Mitchell (see Smell, p. 702.), she could distinguish strangers from acquaintance by the smell; but she required the further help of the touch to distinguish one friend from another. " When they came in, they used to present their hands to her as a means for making themselves known. The form and the warmth of the hand generally furnished the differences which she distin- guished ; but sometimes she would span the wrist and measure the fingers. A lady with whom she was well acquainted, coming in upon a very hot day after having walked a mile, presented her hand as usual ; she examined it longer than ordinary, and seemed to doubt to whom it belonged; but at length she said,— * I think it is Mrs. M.; but she is warmer to-day than I ever felt her before.'"f * It is worthy of remark, that, when the idea of teaching the blind to read from raised characters was first being carried into practice, it was thought requisite by many to adopt a new alphabet of sim- pler forms, instead of the ordinary letters, in order that they might be more readily discriminated. This plan, however, was subject to the disadvantage that the teacher as well as the pupil was compelled to learn this new alphabet; and as it was soon found that the ordinary Roman capitals, reduced to their simplest forms, could be discriminated by the blind with very little more trouble than the best set of new signs that could be devised, the idea of a spe- cial alphabet for their use has been given up. ■f " Lost Senses," vol. ii. p. 81, Of this lady it is positively affirmed that she was able to distinguish colours by the touch. " A lady, who was nearly related to the sufferer, having an apron on, which ac- cording to the fashion of the time, was em- broidered with silk of different colours, asked her if she could tell her what colour it was; and after applying her fingers attentively to the figures of the embroidery, she replied that it was red, blue, and green ; but whether there were other colours in the apron, the writer of the account does not remember. The same lady having a pink ribbon on her head, and being desirous still further to satisfy her curiosity and her doubts, asked her what colour that was ? After feeling it for some time, her cousin answered that it was a pink colour. This answer was the more surprising, as it showed that she was not only capable of distinguishing different colours, but different shades of the same colour."* It is probable that in this and similar cases, the difference of hue is indicated by some diffe- rence of surface, which becomes appreciable to a refined touch. Of course, it can only be to a person who has once enjoyed sight, and who can therefore form ideas of colour, that such ideas could be suggested by the sense of touch ; and a new set of associations must be formed by habit between the tactile qualities of the surface, and the visual conception called up by its designation. Those who have been born blind must be utterly incapable of forming any such conceptions, and distinc- tions of colour can be to them nothing more than names ; yet even such have been able to discriminate by the touch between stuffs of different hues, which were similar in other respects. That such a power should be attained seems the less difficult of belief, when it is borne in mind that all colour depends upon the molecular arrangement of the par- ticles of the surfaces of bodies ; so that there is no great improbability — much less an im- possibility— in the asserted discrimination of these by a touch rendered delicate by con- stant practice, and by the habit of attending to its minutest indications. It is well known that Dr. Saunderson, the celebrated blind pro- fessor of mathematics at Cambridge, not only acquired a very accurate knowledge of medals, but could even distinguish genuine medals from imitations, more certainly than most connoisseurs in full possession of their senses ; and this power must have depended on pecu- liarities of their surface, too minute to be ap- preciated by an ordinary touch, and not dis- tinguished by the sight. Not only does the sense of touch, in its simplest form, undergo this remarkable exalta- tion, but also the muscular sense, which is em- ployed in combination with it in the acquire- ment of information respecting the forms, di- mensions, distances, &c. of objects. Of this, the case of the lady just cited affords an apt illustration : " To amuse herself in the mourn- ful solitude and darkness to which she had * Op. cit. p. 79.1179 TOUCH. been reduced, the sufferer took to working with her needle; and it is remarked that her needlework was uncommonly neat and exact. Among many other pieces of needlework pre- served in her family, was a pincushion which could scarcely be equalled. She used also sometimes to write ; and her writing was executed with the same neatness and precision as her needlework ; the characters were very pretty, the lines were all even, and the letters placed at equal distances from each other : — but the most extraordinary circumstance was, that she could by some means discover where a letter or a word had been omitted, and would place the caret under and the word over, in the right place." * This fact is obviously analogous to those formerly related, in refer- ence to the exaltation of the muscular sense in the state of somnambulism. (See Sleep, p. 694.) It is by the accurate estimates which they are thus enabled to form, that we find the blind able to learn various handicraft arts, performance on musical instruments, &c. &c, which they practice with great success ; cabi- net-making, turning, and even watch-making, seem to be within the capacity of such as have a mechanical turn ; but the greatest perfec- tion of this sense is shown by those who have succeeded in modelling and sculpture. Of these, Giovanni Gonelli, sometimes called Gambasia, from the place of his birth, deserves special mention. He lost his sight at the age of twenty, and remained for ten years in that state, ignorant of the very elements of sculp- ture. But, on a sudden, the desire of making a statue came upon him ; and having handled in every way a marble figure representing Cosmo de Medici, he formed one of clay so extremely like, that it astonished all who saw it. His talent for statuary soon developed itself to such a degree, that the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany sent him to Home to model a statue of Pope Urban VIII., which he also rendered a very striking likeness of the original. He afterwards executed many others with equal success; amongst these, a marble statue of our Charles I. It is re- lated that the Duke of Bracciano, who had seen him at work, doubted much that he was completely blind, — and in order to set the matter at rest, he caused the artist to model his head in a dark cellar. It proved a striking * Op. cit. p. 81. It is worthy of remark, that in consequence of the strangeness of these facts to those who observed them, it was long doubted whether some faint remains of sight or hearing did not exist. Many experiments were tried to settle this matter; but in this great caution was necessary; for some of these being accidentally discovered, she fell into violent convulsions, — these being appar- ently induced by the mental agitation she expe- rienced at the thought of being suspected of insin- cerity, or of being supposed capable of acting so wicked a part, as to feign such infirmities. Sir Hans Sloane, who attended this patient, long entertained doubts respecting the facts related of her; but having been permitted to satisfy himself by what- ever experiments he thought proper, he at length declared his conviction that she was totally blind, deaf, and dumb. likeness. Some, however, objecting that the duke's beard, which was of patriarchal ampli- tude, had made the operation of producing a seeming likeness too easy, the artist offered to model one of the duke's daughters, which he accordingly did ; and this also proved an ad- mirable likeness. Dr. Guillee, who details the preceding case in his " Essai stir ['Instruc- tion des Aveugles," mentions also the more recent case of M. Buret, whom he calls '' one of the most able sculptors of the academy; " who became blind at the age of twenty-five, but was not thereby deterred from pursuing with much success, the course of life which he had previously chosen. It is easy to be con- ceived that a blind man might thus model or chisel accurately under the guidance of his touch, so far as mere form is concerned ; but it has been thought difficult to understand how he could thus discriminate and embody that expression, which has been supposed to be intangible* When it is remembered,how- ever, that expression must at last depend upon niceties of form, and can only be imitated by the sculptor who is under the guidance of his sight, by a minute attention to these niceties, the difficulty altogether disappears. The blind sculptor cannot form an idea of the expres- sion of his model, as seen by the eyes of others; but he may reproduce that expression with complete success, by perfectly imitating the form which exhibits it; just as he may study and understand the laws of optics, without having ever seen the faintest ray of light. The study of natural history might have been supposed to be beyond the reach of the blind, in consequence of the difficulty of distinguish- ing specimens by the touch alone ; yetTthere have been examples of complete success in this pursuit. Thus of John Gough it is re- lated, that " from an early age he showed a very decided taste for zoology ; and in time he began to enlarge his knowledge of organic bodies by extending his researches from the animal to the vegetable kingdom. To bo- tanical pursuits all the time he could spare from the necessary studies of the school was most assiduously devoted ; and as his ardour in cultivating this branch of science was never relaxed, he soon conquered most of the dif- ficulties which the want of sight opposed to the gratification of this taste, and was even- tually able to discriminate and arrange with great accuracy the plants that came under his notice. His usual method of examining a plant was by applying the tip of his tongue to its several parts. Ordinary plants he could easily and readily distinguish by the touch of his fingers. To evince the power of discri- mination and strength of memory, which could alone have enabled him to take an interest in this pursuit, it is mentioned, that towards the end of his life a rare plant was put into his hands, which he very soon called by its name, observing that he had never met with more than one specimen of it, and that was fifty • " Lost Senses," vol. ii. p. 224.1180 TOUCH. years ago."* A case of the same kind has been long under the writer's observation ; the subject of it being a gentleman who became blind from amaurosis soon after the age of twenty. His attention having been directed to geology and conchology, he gradually acquired a very complete knowledge of shells both recent and fossil ; being not only able to re- cognise every one of the numerous specimens in his own cabinet, but also to mention the nearest alliances of a shell previously unknown to him. He has occupied himself, moreover, in freeing his fossil shells from their matrix, with a hammer and chisel, knife, &c. ; and has frequently done this with a perfection that could scarcely be surpassed, rarely injuring the specimen with his tools, and generally clearing it completely from its incrustation, where this was practicable. In this way he has succeeded in forming a very valuable col- lection of the fossils of the interesting locality in which he resides. A similar exaltation may manifest itself, under the like circumstances, in the general tactile sensibility, both of the surface and in- terior of the body, especially as affected by the vibrations transmitted through solid sub- stances ; whereby a deficiency in the sense of hearing is in some degree supplied. Thus the visitor to a school for the deaf and dumb remarks with surprise that a slight rap given by the master on the table or floor is sufficient to excite the attention of the pupils ; and finds on examination that this is not heard, but is felt by them. A minute account of his personal experience on this head is given by Dr. Kitto ; and as it involves several interest- ing physiological considerations, the principal facts mentioned by him will be here brought under the notice of the reader. — " In the state of entire deafness," he remarks, " a peculiar susceptibility of the whole frame to tangible percussions supplies the only intimations which have the slightest approximation to those which hearing affords. I was about to call this a peculiar susceptibility of the sense of touch ; but this would unduly limit a kind of vibration, which, in certain of its develop- ments, seems to pervade the whole frame, to the very bones and marrow. I do not at all imagine that there is in this anything essen- tially different from that which is experienced by those who are in possession of their hear- ing ; but it would seem that the absence of that sense concentrates the attention more exclusively upon the sensation which is through this medium obtained; and the in- timation of which, being no longer checked and verified by the information of higher organs, assume an importance which does not naturally belong to them." This sense of percussion is but little excited in the human body by the vibrations of air ; obviously be- cause there is no expanded surface adapted to receive their influence. Thus Dr. Kitto mentions that the loudest thunder makes no impression upon him, unless it shakes * " Lost Senses," vol. ii. p. 215. the house in which he is ; in which case it communicates a sensation resembling that produced by the removal of a piece of fur- niture in an adjoining room.* In like man- ner, he is utterly unconscious alike of the sound of bells, and of the vibration produced by their percussion, unless the latter be pro- pagated through solid bodies, as when he places himself in direct contact with a tower in which a powerful peal is being rung. " I re- member," he says, " that once when I was showing a young friend from the country over St. Paul's, we happened to be up examining the great clock, at the very time it began to strike. The sensation which this occasioned was that of very heavy blows upon the fabric in which I stood, communicated to my feet by contact with the floor, and by the feet diffused over the whole body. So," he con- tinues, "guns — even powerful cannon — make no impression upon this sense, unless I happen to be very near when they are fired ; in that case, I can compare the effect to no- thing better than the sensation produced by a heavy blow upon the head from a fist co- vered with a boxing glove. This effect could only be produced by the tangible percussion of the air, and by the percussion upon the ground transmitted by the feet." So, again, Dr. Kitto states that he is not conscious of even a very loud knock at the door of the room in which he is, unless the door be in such connection with the floor that the per- cussion is communicated through the latter, or unless he be himself in contact with some part of the wall to which it is hung. But, on the other hand, he states, — "The drawing of furniture, as tables and sofas, over the floor above or below me, the shutting of doors, and the feet of children at play, distress me far more than the same causes would do if 1 were in actual possession of my hearing. By being to me unattended by any circumstances or preliminaries, they startle dreadfully; and by the vibration being diffused from the feet over the whole body, they shake the whole nervous system, in a way which even long use has not enabled me to bear. The moving of a table is to me more than to the reader would be the com- bined noise and vibration of a mail coach drawn over a wooden floor ; the feet of children, like the tramp of horses upon the same floor; and the shutting of a door like a thunder-clap, shaking the very house. It is by having once heard, that I am enabled to make such comparisons as these, for the illustration of a sensation which one who has never heard, and one who is not deaf, would be alike unable to describe." The fact that the shutting of a door is felt with painful distinctness (as Dr. Kitto elsewhere mentions), even when upon a different floor, whilst the loudest ordinary knocking at the same door is not perceived, very curiously * The writer of this article, residing near a rail- way tunnel, has frequently noticed that the emer- gence of a train is indicated by the succussion of the windows of his house, before it becomes audible.1181 TOUCH. illustrates the necessity for the transmission of the vibrations along a solid medium. "The valve of the door on which the percussion is made by knocking, is a detached frame of wood hung upon hinges, and the vibration is therefore comparatively isolated and not pro- pagated throughout the frame of the house, as is the case when, in shutting the door, the valve itself strikes the door-post, which is identified with the framework of the build- ing." In illustration of the acuteness of this sense in his own person, Dr. Kitto states that the lightest footfall upon the same floor is quite sufficient to attract his attention, or even to arouse him from sleep. " If any small article," he continues, " such as a thimble, a pencil, a penknife, or even a more minute object, falls from the table to the floor, I am often aware of it, even when other persons sitting at the same table have not been apprised of it by the ear. The greater the number of my points of contact with the floor, the stronger are the impres- sions I receive : hence they are more vivid and distinct when I sit than when I stand ; be- cause, in the former case, not only my own two legs, but the four legs of my chair, are concerned in conveying the percussion to my sensorium. And when the chair itself on which I am seated has been subject to the percussion, the sensation is such as baffles description. For instance, a few days since, when I was seated with the back of my chair facing a chiffbniere, the door of this re- ceptacle was opened by some one, and swung back so as to touch my chair. The touch could not but have been slight, but to me the concussion was dreadful, and almost made me scream with the surprise and pain, the sensa- tion being very similar to that which a heavy person feels on touching the ground, when he has jumped from a higher place than he ought. Even this concussion, to me so violent and distressing, had not been noticed by any one in the room but myself. * * * If these per- ceptions are so acute in carpeted rooms, it will be easily understood by how much more intense they become upon a naked wooden floor. The sensation then amounts to torture — as every movement or concussion, in any part of the room, then comes with an in- tensity of effect, far more than proportioned to the difference in the impression which would, under the same circumstances, be pro- duced upon the auditory sense." It is interesting to remark that, notwith- standing this acuteness of the sense in ques- tion, it does not seem to convey (in Dr. K.'s case at least) any information of the direction or distance of the percussions, except such as is afforded by their relative intensity. Thus he says ; — "I am unable to determine from the information of the sensation itself, whether it has occurred upon the floor above, or in that below me, or in the passage or room ad- joining that in which I may be at the time. I am not aware that the impression is more distinct from the floor above than from that below; but it certainly is more distinct in another room of the same floor, than from either the one above or below; whence I am much in the habit of referring to the next room the percussions which make the strongest impression on me. In this I am not seldom mistaken. * * * The information is equally defective, even in the very room I may happen to occupy. If a book or other object falls in any part of the room, the sen- sation is painfully distinct, the percussion being upon the very boards on which I stand ; but even in this case, 1 am at a loss for the quarter in which the circumstance has oc- curred, and generally look for it in the wrong direction, and have to scan the whole room with my eye before I can make it out." It is probable that the want of power to estimate direction arises from the circumstance that the communication of the percussions takes place, in this and similar cases, through the same channel (the floor) to the same parts of the solid mass of the body, through which the vibrations immediately spread in every direction. It can easily be conceived that if the percussions were transmitted through a liquid medium, its vibrations, being propagated in a more determinate direction, might affect one or another part of the surface in such a manner as to suggest the direction of their source ; and that in this mode aquatic animals endowed with a nervous apparatus at their surface, specially adapted to be impressed by such vibrations, might communicate with each other through great distances. This appears to be the case with regard to the Spermaceti Whale, and probably others of the Cetacea. It has been observed by the whale-fishers, that when a straggler from a " school" is attacked, even at a distance of several miles from it, a number of its fellows bear down to its assistance, in an almost incredibly short space of time. It can scarcely be doubted that this communication must be made through the medium of the vibrations of the water, excited by the struggles of the animal, or per- haps by some peculiar instinctive movements especially adapted for this purpose, and pro- pagated through the liquid medium to the large cutaneous surface of the distant whales. And this idea is confirmed by the fact, that the nerves which proceed to the surface of the body pass through the layers of blubber (which form the inner part of the true skin) with scarcely any division, and then spread out into a network of extreme minuteness as soon as they approach the exterior of the in- tegument. The expanse of such a network over a thick layer of elastic tissue, whose meshes are distended with oleaginous fluid, obviously affords a condition peculiarly fa- vourable to the reception of impressions ori- ginating in percussion. After the details which have been given in proof of the degree of exaltation of which the general tactile sensibility is capable in the human subject, we shall have less difficulty in understanding that even the vibrations of air,1182 TOUCH. excited by percussion, may become the chief means of guidance to animals possessed of a special apparatus for taking cognisance of them. Such appears to be the case in the Bat tribe, and especially in those species whose habits are most exclusively nocturnal, and whose dwellings admit the smallest quan- tity of light. "The whole surface of their wings, on both sides, may be considered as an enormously-expanded organ of touch, of the most exquisite sensibility to the peculiar sen- sation for which it is intended ; and it is, therefore, by the varied modifications of the impulsion of the atmosphere upon this sur- face, that the knowledge of the propinquity of foreign bodies is communicated." * It would not seem improbable, however, that the remarkable cutaneous expansions with which the nose and ear are furnished in many bats, are subservi- ent to this function. The enormous exten- sion of the external ear may doubtless aug- ment the intensity of the sense of hearing ; but it is scarcely accordant with our know- ledge of the conditions under which the sense of smell is exercised, to suppose that the extraordinary " nose-leaf" of the RMnolophid.ee should be in any great degree subservient to olfactive purposes. The bats of this group (to which belong the greater and lesser horse- shoe bats of our own country) " are more completely lucifugous and retired in their ha- bits than any others ; they are found in the darkest penetralia of caverns, and other places where there is not even the imperfect light which the other genera of bats enjoy." -f- Some approach to this power of guidance, de- rived either from the impressions made by the air upon the cutaneous surface, or from the radiation of heat, is occasionally seen in blind persons; who can thus distinguish fby the hands, and even by the face, the proximity of solid bodies (as in approaching a wall, a door, or a piece of furniture) without actually touching them. The sense of temperature, also, appears to be capable of considerable improvement, when its indications are habitually and discrimi- natingly attended to, or when the mind is intensely and exclusively fixed upon them. Thus it is related of Dr. Saunderson, that when some of his pupils were taking the sun's altitude, he was able to tell, by the slight alteration in the temperature of the air, when very light clouds were passing over the sun's disk. Morbid Conditions of the Sense of Touch. Like most other vital functions, the sense of touch may become disordered in the way of deficiency, excess, or depravation. The state of complete deficiency is known as Anaesthesia; a term which, strictly speaking, designates the absence of all sensation, but which is more commonly employed as re- ferring to the sense of touch alone. This * See Cheiroptera, vol. i. p. 599. ■j- Loc. cit. state, which may be either general or local, may arise from an interruption in the func- tional activity of any part of the nervous ap- paratus concerned in the reception of sensory impressions; and thus may be due to causes acting either (1) at the peripheral origins of the sensory nerves, or (2) on the nerves in their course, or (3) on the sensorial centres ; as well as to such as act on the whole nervous system at once. The causes which act at the peripheral origins of the nerves may be such as affect either the nerves themselves, the capillary circulation, or both. Of the first we have a typical example in the " anaesthetic agents," ether, chloroform, &c.; the applica- tion of whose vapour for any length of time to the cutaneous surface, entirely suspends its power of receiving sensory impressions ; and that this results from the direct action of the substances on the peripheral nervous ex- pansion, appears from the fact of the suspen- sion being precisely limited to the part to which the vapour is applied. But anaesthesia may be induced, also, by the stagnation of the capillary circulation in a part, without any more direct affection of its nervous endow- ments ; as we see when the main artery of a limb has been tied, previously to the re- establishment of the supply of blood by the collateral circulation, or when the flow of blood through it has been impeded by tem- porary pressure. It is probable that cold operates in producing local anaesthesia in both these modes ; namely, by its direct sedative action upon the peripheral nerves ; and by the stagnation which it produces in the capillary circulation. That the local anaesthesia, which is a not unfrequent result of the presence of poisonous substances in the blood, is due to the special action of these substances upon the peripheral nerves of the particular locality, would not seem an improbable supposition ; when it is remembered how frequently poisons of various kinds single out some particular part of a structure apparently homogeneous, for the production of their peculiar effects, — lead, for example, in whatever way introduced into the system, acting first on the muscular fibres of the alimentary canal, and afterwards most commonly on the extensor muscles of the forearm, in which its presence has been detected by chemical analysis. Of the anaesthesia induced by causes acting upon the sensory nerves in their course from the periphery to the centre, our most frequent examples are those in w hich it is produced by pressure on these trunks, whereby the con- veyance of the sensory impressions to the encephalon is effectually checked. Anaesthesia may also arise, however, from diseased con- ditions of these trunks, brought about by perverted nutrition; and there is a form of paraplegia, in which the lesion of sensibility (which is more completely lost than the motor power) appears to commence in the peripheral expansions of the nerves, and to extend along the trunks to the central organs.* This is * Graves's Clinical Medicine, vol. i. p. 503.1183 TOUCH. usually referrible, in the first place, to the influence of cold and damp; and it is especi- ally liable to occur in persons of a rheumatic or gouty diathesis. That even the sedative influence of cold may be propagated along the nerve-trunks, and that its anaesthetic effect is not due to its peripheral influence alone, appears from the circumstance remarked by Dr. Graves (loc. cit.), that the paralysis induced by handling snow, or by immersing the hands in freezing mixtures for some little time, is not confined to the hands and fingers, but extends to the muscles and surface of the fore-arms. And it was also remarked by the same eminent physician, that in a case in which the inside of the ring finger had been wounded by a blunt needle, and a partial anaesthesia induced, the same effect was per- ceived in the little finger (alike supplied by the ulnar nerve), obviously through the extension of the paralysing influence towards the centre, so as to affect the trunk higher up than the point at which its branch to the little finger was given off. Dr. Graves further cites, as an example of anaesthesia having its seat in disordered nutrition of the peripheral nerves, and gradually advancing along their trunks towards the centres, the curious Epidemie de Paris, which occurred in the spring and sum- mer of 1828. " It began (frequently in per- sons of good constitution) with sensations of pricking and severe pain in the integuments of the hands and feet, accompanied by so acute a degree of sensibility, that the patients could not bear these parts to be touched by the bed-clothes. After some time, a few days, or even a few hours, a diminution, or even abolition of sensation took place in the affected members ; they became incapable of distin- guishing the shape, texture, or temperature of bodies, the power of motion declined, and finally they were observed to become al- together paralytic. The injury was not con- fined to the hands and feet alone, but, ad- vancing with progressive pace, extended over the whole of both extremities. Persons lay in bed powerless and helpless, and continued in this state for weeks and months. Every remedy which the ingenuity of the French practitioners could suggest was tried, and proved ineffectual. In some, the stomach and bowels were deranged, and this affection terminated in a bad state of health, and even in death ; in others, the vital organs, cerebral, respiratory, and digestive, were in the same state as before their illness, and their appetites were good, but still they remained paralytics. At last, at some period of the disease, motion and sensation gradually returned, and a re- covery generally took place, although, in some instances, the paralysis was very capricious, vanishing and again re-appearing. In the fatal cases, no evidence could be obtained, from the most diligent search, of any lesion, functional or organic, in the brain, cerebellum, or spinal marrow."* These phenomena are * Op. Cit. p. 504. scarcely explicable on any other hypothesis than that of some general cause (probably a morbid matter circulating in the blood) affect- ing the nutrition and functional activity of the nerve-trunks, rather than of their centres. That anaesthesia may proceed from various causes whose operation is limited to the sen- sorial centres, is a matter of every-day ex- perience. It is, however, where they have suffered from some obvious lesion of a com- paratively restricted character, that the proof of this is most complete ; for although there is strong ground for believing that the ordi- nary operation of anaesthetic agents and nar- cotic poisons is confined to the cerebrum and sensorium, yet we could not positively affirm such to be the case, since, when taken into the blood, they may act not only on the sen- sorial centres, but on the entire nervous system. All the phemomena of narcoctic poisoning, however, indicate that opium, al- cohol, &c, single out the cerebrum and sen- sory ganglia for their special action, just as strychnia singles out the spinal cord; the suspension of the functional activity of the former being usually complete, before there is the slightest affection of the latter. That a failure of the circulation in the encephalon produces complete and universal anaesthesia while it lasts, was fully proved by Sir A. Cooper's well-known experiment; and it seems probable that many of the structural lesions which manifest themselves in paralysis of motion and sensation produce this suspen- sion of functional power in parts not them- selves affected by disease, chiefly in virtue of the derangement of the intra-cranial circula- tion which they invole. There is one of the phenomena of the anaes- thesia produced by the accidental or inten- tional introduction of poisonous substances into the blood, which seems deserving of more special notice ; viz., the suspension of the power of receiving painful impressions, with- out the obliteration of the ordinary tactile sensibility. This is a frequent result of the exhibition of ether and chloroform; and does not seem to depend upon a mere blunting of the ordinary sensibility. It has been especi- ally noticed, also, in cases of lead poisoning, in which state it seems to be more frequent than complete anaesthesia. According to M. Beau, the insensibility to pain, which he terms analgesia, may be observed in a large propor- tion of cases of " saturnine intoxication." " We must not confine ourselves," he remarks, " to asking the patient whether he feels, but limit our question to the sensation of pain. Parts which are thus insensible to pain are so also to tickling. This form of anaesthesia may affect the entire surface, being, however, most remarkable in the extremities, and especially the upper ones. It may extend even to the mucous membranes, and especially those which are normally endowed with great sen- sibility, — as the uvula, isthmus faucium, nares, or conjunctiva, — any of which parts may be tickled without the usual conse-1184 TOUCH. quences, the patient still being quite con- scious of the mere contact."* Reference has been already made to the influence of the attention on the acuteness of sensations; and to the slight degree in which they are felt, when the mind is completely engrossed in some other feeling or idea This is sometimes seen in spontaneous reverie; and there are individuals who can exert such a power of mental abstraction, as voluntarily to concentrate their attention on some ex- ternal object, or internal idea, so as to escape all suffering from a severe operation. This, however, is much better seen in some of those cases of somnambulism (see Sleep) in which the mind is completely under the guidance of the suggestions received from without, its whole spontaneous directing power being suspended. For it is frequently possible, in such cases, to withdraw the patient's atten- tion from any part of the body, to such an extent that the anaesthesia is complete as regards that part, whilst every other portion enjoys the ordinary sensibility. Thus a tem- porary loss of sensation on the whole of one side may be induced, or a single limb may be rendered anaesthetic; and the sensibility of the parts may be instantaneously restored, merely by directing the patient's attention towards them. With regard to IiypcrcestJiesia, or increased sensibility, we have much less definite in- formation. There can be no doubt, however, that it, too, may proceed from changes either in the periphery, or in the central organs, and perhaps also from an alteration in the trunks of the nerves in their course. The acute sensibility of an inflamed or irritated part is an example of the first of these conditions; and the extraordinary exaltation of sensibility in the incipient stage of phrenitis may serve as an illustration of the second. In some cases the entire nervous system would seem to partake of this undue excitability ; this we especially see in hysterical subjects, in whom the slightest contact frequently occasions in- tense suffering, so that even the mere pointing of a finger at any part of the body will cause a scream of alarm. The sufferings of such persons are not rightly designated as ima- ginary; they are as real to them as are those proceeding from far more serious causes to persons of less excitable temperament. The fault partly lies in the habitual attention which they pay to the most trivial feelings ; but in part also, it may be surmised, to an abnormal state of nutrition of the entire nervous system,—both centres and trunks,— from depravation of the blood. This view harmonizes well with the fact just now stated, that in the Epidemie de Paris, a temporary hypercesthesia (afterwards giving place to an- aesthesia) was commonly among the earliest symptoms. And it is not a little curious that in the remarkable se ries of cases of lead- poisoning which recently occurred in the ex- royal family of France, during their residence * Archives Ge'ne'rales, torn. xvi. pp. 5—24. at Claremont, the same symptom presented itself, and was in some instances the only symptom which indicated the morbid con- tamination of the blood.* In most cases of this form of hyperesthesia, the exaltation of sensibility seems confined to the surface, being much more excited by a slight touch than by hard pressure; and this difference will frequently serve to distinguish the " hys- terical" tenderness from that of inflammation, in which the pain is augmented the more severe the pressure. The writer has had opportunities of noticing an extreme sensi- tiveness to changes of temperature in certain cases of somnambulism, both natural and artificial ; and he believes that this fact affords a ready solution of various marvels which have been narrated touching the power of "mesmerized" subjects to distinguish a piece of money which had been held in the mes- merizer's hands, or a glass of water in which his finger had been immersed. It has recently been proposed to apply Prof. Weber's method of estimating the re- lative acuteness of the tactile sense in dif- ferent parts of the body, to the determination of the degree of anaesthesia or of hyper- esthesia, in patients affected with these dis- orders. Thus it was found by M. Brown- Sequard that in one case of nearly complete anaesthesia of the lower extremities, the pa- tient only felt a single impression on the skin of his legs, when the points of the com- passes were from 10 to 20 centim. apart; the normal "limit of confusion" for this portion of the surface being from 3 to 5 centim. In another case of slighter anaesthesia, the " limit of confusion" in the same part was from 9 to 15 centim. And in a third case of very slight anaesthesia, it was from 6 to 7 centim. In a case of hyperaesthesia, on the other hand, which accompanied paralysis of the motor power, the patient could perceive the distinctness of the two points on the foot, when they were separated to the distance of only 5 millim., although the normal "limit of confusion" in that part was from 25 to 30 millim. The sensibility to pain, in this case, was as much exaggerated as was the tactile sensibility. Of the depravation of tactile sensibility, manifested in a variety of morbid phenomena, — such as the sense of heat or even of burning (without any real elevation of temperature), of formication, of tickling, of itching, &c, — it must suffice here to remark, that this, like the preceding affections, may be due to causes acting on the peripheral nerves, or on the nervous centres, or on the connecting trunks. Of the latter we have a good example in the formication which generally succeeds complete anaesthesia, when a nerve has been pressed upon for a time, and the pressure is then re- moved. W. B.

(Ttimciers, Fri; Nackt- Muscheler and See-Scheiden, Germ.)—The Tunicata are molluscous animals, having no calcified shell, but a more or less coriaceous envelope or tunic, whence their name. This external coat or test is either bag-shaped and provided with two apertures, or is tube-shaped and open at the ends. They have no distinct head, and no organs serving as arms or feet ; they are provided with a muscular and a nervous system; and with well-defined or- gans of respiration, digestion, circulation, and generation. They are exclusively marine, and are widely spread from the arctic to the tropical seas. Sessile or foot-stalked on the rock, or in- crusting seaweed and other bodies, their external form is seldom of graceful contour; yet the arrangement of the individuals in the compound masses often exhibits curious and elegant designs. The floating forms, however, with their lengthened, sinuous chain, or tapering tubes, pellucid, rainbow-tinted, or, by night, brightly phosphorescent, are sur- passed by no terrestrial object. The other, fixed, forms, not altogether destitute of ele- gance of colour in the northern seas, become in warmer climates more and more rich in variegated hues, and in the tropics are amongst the most resplendent living gems of ocean's parterres. The earliest notice of the tunicate animals is made by Aristotle, who gives a very cor- rect account of the anatomical and zoological characters of a simple Ascidian, which he calls TtQvov* They, however, attracted no further notice until comparatively late times. Ron- deletf gives indifferent figures and descriptions. Gesner and Aldrovandus, uniting Rondelet's Tethya with those given by Belon J, which are A/cyonia, were among the first who gave rise to the confusion that long existed in the history of these animals. Linnaeus in the 4th edition of his Systema Naturae placed a Tethyum in his system, under the appellation of Tcthys; he pointed out at the same time that the animal of bivalve Molluscs was a Tcthys, showing that he was aware of the analogy of the Bivalves with the Tunicates. In other respects, however, he added to the confusion. After that Bohatsch § and Plancus || figured and described some species. Baster1[ describes a species, and gives it the name of Ascklium (from aoicoc, a skin- bottle), at the same time adding a very just remark on the analogy of its internal struc- ture with that of the oyster. This analogy was noticed also by Pallas, who proposed the union of the Tethyum and Ascidium **, which Linnaeus carried out in the 12th edit, of his Systema Naturae, uniting the species, noticed by Bohatsch and Koenig, under the * Hist.

Fabriciusf, Dicquemare|, Pallas and others, described and figured several Ascidice, which Brugiere || and GmelinU collected together in their re- spective works, without adding much to the knowledge of the group. Cuvier's first ob- servations on the simple Ascidians were begun in 1797, and his memoir on their anatomy was published in 1815.** About the same time were published the researches of Schalkjf on the anatomy, and of Cams J{ on the anatomy and development of the Ascidians. The memoirs of Peron and Lesueur on the Pyrosoma, Desmarest and Lesueur || || on the Botryllus, and particularly the elaborate work of Savignyll on the simple and compound Ascidians, enabled naturalists to make rapid advances in the knowledge of this family. With respect to the Salpians, Brown***, For- skahlfff, and TilesiusXtt wel'e tne nrst to figure and describe any forms of this group. Considerable confusion with regard to these forms existed in the classifications of Linnaeus, Pallas, Brugiere, and Bosc, and indeed in the earlier writings of Lamarck and Cuvier, until the latter had an opportunity of work- ing out the anatomical characters of these animals. The earlier works on the various branches of this subject have been succeeded by the publication of the researches of many dis- tinguished naturalists. We are chiefly in- debted to the labours of Cuvier, Savigny, Carus, MacLeay, and Van Beneden, for in- formation on the structure and development of the simple Ascidians ; to the researches of Cuvier, Kuhl and Van Hasselt, Chamisso, Eschricht, and Krohn, for the history of the Salpians ; and to Lesueur, Desmarest, Sa- vigny, Lister, Sars, Milne-Edwards, Audouin, and Forbes, for our knowledge of the com- pound ascidian forms. And, indeed, since the commencement of the present century, the organisation of this group has been studied with great care, rewarding the labours of naturalists with discoveries of the highest interest. " It was in the animal of the Salpa," says Van Beneden, "that Van Hasselt discovered a heart of such extraordinary character, changing incessantly its auricle to ventricle and its ventricle to auricle, its ar- * Zool.

The heart consists of a slightly bent, contractile Ascidians, too, furnish the first examples of tube, and is situated near to or within the in- complete metamorphosis in the lower ranks of the animal kingdom. The honour of this discovery is due to MM. Audouin and Milne-Edwards. From the late discoveries of M. Sars, these metamorphoses increase in interest, and appear tobe still more remarkable. And, lastly, the Ascidians have contributed very considerably to our knowledge of the eir- testinal loop. The reproductive organs, con- sisting of ovary and testicle, are often lodged in the fold of the intestine. The animal of these "soft-shelled" Mol- luscs has very close affinities with that of the other Acephalans, especially the lamellibran- chiates. And " were the test of an Ascidian converted into a hard shell, symmetrically culatory apparatus of the Mollusca generally." divided into two plates, connected together The term Tunicata was first used by La- marck ; its synonyms are Tet/iya, Auct.; Soft- shelled Molluscs, Hunter ; les Aceplialcs sans eoquiUes, Cuvier; Aeephalophora heterobran- chiata, Blainville ; Tunicaries, Kirby ; Gymna- cephala, Bronn. The Class of animals to which it is applied may be zoologically de- fined as consisting of acephalous Molluscs ; with a soft shell or test, organised, coriaceous or gelatinous, frequently destitute of mineral constituents, having a large proportion of cellulose in its composition : animals single or aggregate; the test of each animal provided with two apertures, one bran- chial, the other anal ; the mantle forming an interior coat ; the branchiae attached dorsally by cartilage, and capable of separation so as to expose the mantle along a ventral mesial line, whilst the orifices protruded at one extremity, it would present the closest similarity with many bivalve Molluscs."* (Forbes.) All the Tunicata are free during the earlier periods of their existence ; some remain per- manently free, floating in the water (Salpa, &c), but the generality (Botryl/i, Ascidi<r,&e.) become fixed to shells, seaweeds, and other marine bodies. Some exist as distinct indivi- duals (Ascidia, Cynthia, &c), whilst various degrees of combination are affected by others (Botrylhis, Clavellina, Pyrosoma, &c.) ; and some are simple in one generation and com- wholly or in part to the internal surface of bined in the next (Sa/pa). the mantle ; the mouth, without labial ten- tacles, placed below the branchial apparatus ; animals hermaphrodite, undergoing metamor- phosis in their young state. The cavity, whether of single or compound Tunicates, is occupied by a more or less muscular sac, provided, like the external tunic, with two orifices. This sac, identical with the " mantle " of the Acephalans, is attached to the inner surface of the test, generally only at the orifices, and contains the viscera. The di- gestive, reproductive, and circulatory organs are disposed at the base of the sac, and its upper and larger portion, lined with, or traversed by, the branchiae, forms the branc hial cavity. This is placed at the commencement of the alimen- tary canal, of which it forms as it were the antechamber. The branchiae have generally the form of ridges, more or less complicated, and seldom symmetrical. The alimentary canal is simple, and barely distinguishable into gullet, stomach, and intestine. It is always convoluted or folded once on itself. The liver adheres to the stomach, and in many species is divided into distinct lobes. The From the above-mentioned various con- ditions of individualism or aggregation under which these animals exist, the family is divisible into two groups — the simple and the aggregate. Such forms of the latter group as were known to the earlier natu- ralists were, from a general similarity of appearance, classed by them with Alcyonia. In the former group have been placed, until a late date, the numerous species of the Sal- pidce, which now however, like the above- mentioned groups, have been separately treated of and illustrated in memoirs and monographs devoted to them. Indeed, although the ex- pressions, simple and aggregate, as will be seen hereafter, are very convenient in describing the physiology of the Tunicata, yet late re- searches have shown that the conditions to which they refer have but a subordinate value in reference to the natural grouping of the class. As may naturally be inferred from what is stated above, the Tunicata have been sub- divided in various manners. The arrangement we are inclined to adopt is as follows : — Tunicata < Dichitonida, Fleming.

On the sea shore, when the tide is out, we find similar bodies attached to the under surface of rough stones.

J Individuals of several species of Ascidians, viz. of the following genera, Molgula, Cynthia, Cystingia, Bipapillaria, and Pelonaia, are found unattached. These animals, however, cannot be said to have an entirely free existence, their tests, whether pe- duncled or otherwise, being usually more or less imbedded in sand or mud, and frequently held to their anchorage by the agglutination of the sur- rounding sand-grains to their outer surface. But from such a position they are easily disturbed, unless when they are lodged within the mud-filled cavities of old shells and of water-worn stones, as is the case with the Pelonaia.1188 TUNICATA. simple (Jig. 778). Dendrodoa closely agrees with Cynthia in its branchial reticulations and its digestive apparatus; but, as Mr. Mac Leay has observed, of the two ovaries possessed by Cynthia, only one, and that the left, is found in Dendrodoa, whilst the right ovary alone is present in Pandocia.

It has, however, other anatomical peculiarities, such as the great de- velopment of the organs of generation, and the position of the heart at the inferior extremity of the body. This group comprehends nu- merous species, and is divisible into two natural sections, recognised by the external conformation of the anal orifice. In one di- vision (P. bistcllata) this orifice is surrounded with a regular circlet of rays or marginal lobules, and is exactly similar to the branchial orifice. In the other division (P. unistellata) the anal differs from the branchial orifice in not being rayed, or at least in having merely irregular marginal lobules. Genus Sigi/lina, Savigny. — Common body a solid, elongated, erect cone; gelatinous, pedunculated, isolated or attached to similar cones, consisting of a single system of many but Professor TViegmann subsequently (Jahresbe- richt in Archiv. 1835) gave it the appellation of Pcrophora Listeri. bodies, mostly those star-figured, investing its stalks, winding among the intricacies of its roots, or clothing with a glairy coat the ex- panse of its foliated extremities. ... In examining these bodies, we find that it is not a single animal which lies before us, but a commonwealth of beings, bound together by common and vital ties. Each star is a family, each group of stars a community. Individuals are linked together in systems, systems com- bined into masses. . . . Indeed, few bo- dies among the forms of animal life exhibit such exquisite and kaleidoscopic figures as those which we see displayed in the combina- tions of the compound Ascidians." Previous to the researches of Savigny, the Botryllidce were regarded as Alcyonia; Gaert- ner (1774) and Renieri (1793) being the only naturalists who had suspected their compound nature and true affinities.* " The Memoir of Savigny, published in 1816, however, threw entirely new and unanticipated light on their nature. He showed that they were essentially Ascidians, differing from the simple forms only in being united into more or less complicated systems." \ In the arrangement of Professor Milne- Edwards the family is subdivided as follows: - Sigillina.

Genus Sidnyium., Savigny. — Common body gelatinous, presenting a series of closely grouped cones, truncated and starred at the summit, rising from a common incrusting base ; each cone composed of a fascicle of indi- viduals, varying in number from five or six to ten or twelve, and forming a margin around a depressed centre. The animals partake of the characters of those of Synaicum and Aplidium, resembling the former in the struc- ture of their stomach, anil the latter in their branchial sac. Each has an eight-toothed branchial orifice and a simple tubular vent folded against the thorax. The ovary is pe- duncled, and very conspicuous at the ex- tremity of the animal. (Forbes.) Genus Synoicum, Phipps.*—Common body semicartilaginous, cylindrical, peduncled, iso- lated or attached to similar cylindrical bodies; svstem single, circular, comprising six to nine animals, terminal; branchial orifice six- rayed; anal orifice having six very unequal rays, the three largest forming the exterior margin of the central star ; post-abdomen sessile. Genus Amaroucium, Milne-Edwards.—Com- mon body fleshy or coriaceous, polymorphous, subpedunculate or sessile, anil incrusting ; systems numerous ; individuals arranged irre- gularly around common cloacal apertures ; divisions of the thorax and abdomina faintly marked. This genus resembles Aplidium and Synointm in the general form of the animal, and Polyclinum in the presence of a central common cavity to each system (fig. 782 ). The tribe Didemnina (Its Didemniem, Milne- Edwards) is formed of all the compound Ascidians whose body is distinctly divided into two parts, thorax and abdomen. These closely approach the Clavcllince, and are dis- tinguished from the Polyclinina by the absence of the post-abdomen and by the position of the organs of generation and the hearr, which are raised up by the side of the intestine. This tribe, like the Polyclinina, is divided into two groups, according to the presence or ab- sence of marginal rays around the anal orifice. M. Milne-Edwards observes that the bistellate group (Dhtomus and Diazona) forms a con- necting link between the Clavellincs and the Botryllidcc. Genus Distomus, Gaertnert; synonyms, Alcyonium, Auct., Polyzona, Fleming.— Com- mon body semi-cartilaginous, polymorphous, sessile; systems numerous, usually circular; individuals placed in one or two ranks at un- equal distances from their common centre. Both orifices six-rayed. Genus Diazona, Savigny. — Common body gelatinous, orbicular, sessile or subpedunculate; system single, expanded into a disc, compara- ble to that of a flower or of an Actinia; animals very prominent, arranged in con- centric circles (fig. 770.) ; branchial and anal orifices six-rayed ; abdomen peduncled ; ovary enclosed in the intestinal loop. Genus Didemnum, Savigny.—Common body coriaceous, polymorphous, sessile and incrust- ing ; systems numerous, compressed, without central cavities or distinct circumscription ; animals without any appreciable order of arrangement; abdomen peduncled ; ovary placed by the side of the intestinal loop, in- creasing in length when the eggs are fully developed.

GenusLeptoclinum, Milne-Edwards.—Com- mon body sometimes coriaceous, sometimes gelatinous, thin, sessile and incrusting ; sys- tems few ; individuals arranged irregularly around common cloacal cavities ; abdomen peduncled, short, smaller than the thorax. The tribe Botryllina (les Botrylliens, Milne- Edwards) comprises those compound Asci- dians that are united in sy stems around common excretory cavities or cloaca;, and whose bodies are not divided into a distinct thorax and abdomen, the viscera being pushed forward on the side of the branchial cavity, and form- ing with the thorax an ovoid mass. Genus Botryllwi, Gaertner ; synonyms, Al- ci/oniitm, Auct., Polycyelus, Lamarck. — Com- mon body gelatinous or cartilaginous, sessile and incrusting ; systems numerous, pro- minent, round or star-shaped, with central cavities; individuals, six to twenty in each system, lying horizontally with the vent far from the branchial orifice; branchial orifice simple (7%. 771.). Genus Botrylloidcs, Milne-Edwards. — This genus resembles the foregoing in most respects, except that the stars formed by the systems of animals are irregular and ramifying ; the cloaca; being prolonged into the common mass as irregular internal channels, on each side of which the individuals are placed in linear series, instead of having a simple star- like arrangement around the cloaca?, as in jBotryllus. The animals of Botrylloides, more- over, have a nearly vertical position, and their orifices are closely approximate {fig. 783.).

The Pyrosomians are represented by three or four species of the single genus Pyrosoma. They inhabit the Mediterranean and the warmer parts of the ocean ; in the former at times their abundance is a source of dread to the fishermen, sometimes even completely clogging their nets ; and in certain oceanic regions they are met with in almost incredible profusion. Their delicate and transparent forms, their elegant tints, and their unrivalled phosphorescence render them the most beau- tiful of Molluscs, and objects of admiration to the naturalist and the voyager. Mr. Bennett relates that, during a voyage to India, the ship, proceeding at a rapid rate, continued during an entire night to pass through distinct but extensive fields of these Molluscs, float- ing, and glowing as they floated, on all sides of her course. Enveloped in a flame of bright phosphorescent light, and gleaming with a greenish lustre, the Pyrosomes, seen at night, in vast shoals upwards of a mile in breadth, and stretching out till lost in the distance, present a spectacle the glory of which may be easily imagined. The vessel, as it cleaves the gleaming mass, throws up strong flashes of light, as if ploughing through liquid fire, which illuminates the hull, the sails, and the ropes with a strange unearthly radiance. Genus Pyrosoma, Peron. — Common body semi-cartilaginous, floating, cylindrical, 2 to 14 inches long, \ to 3 inches in circumference ; bearing externally numerous pointed pro- cesses, hollow and mammillated within, and open at one of its extremities only. Animals associated in a verticillate arrangement, having two orifices, one at each extremity ; elongated, fusiform, tapering at the outer, and obtuse at the inner extremity ; united at the circum- ference of the middle portion, by the fusion of the tests to one another into rings, more or less regular, and varying in number accord- ing to species, so that the whole forms the long cylinder above described. Monochitonida. — Family SalpidjE, Forbes.

The Salpians are free, swimming in the ocean ; plentiful in the Me- diterranean and the warm parts of the ocean; occurring also occasionally in the Norwegian and North British seas. In shape they re- semble a short and wide tube, sometimes oval or cylindrical, sometimes more or less square in its transverse section, and varying consi- derably in size according to species, from half an inch to 8 or 10 inches in length. The test is thin and transparent, open at the ends and often supplied with terminal and lateral processes. The mantle lines the test, and is more or less adherent throughout; its interior constitutes the branchial cavity; it is provided at one of the terminal openings with a more or less perfect valvular apparatus; and contains a branchial fold traversing it obliquely. Near one extremity the chief viscera are grouped together into a conspicuous mass (the " visceral nucleus" of authors), to which the brilliant tints of the liver usually impart an orange, brown, or reddish hue (Jig. 772.). Fig. 772. Salpce, isolated and associated. A. S. runcinata, solitary; B. S. runcinata, asso- ciated ; C. S. zonaria, aggregated. This family is of considerable interest on account of their singular mode of reproduc- tion, discovered by Chamisso, and on account of the philosophical generalisations partly founded thereon by Steenstrup. These ani- mals occur under two distinct conditions, being at one time solitary, and at another as- sociated into circular or lengthened groups — termed garlands, cordons, ribands, and chains 0%- 772. B and c). The Salpa-chains, vary- ing in length from a few inches to many feet, swim through the tranquil water with a regular serpentine movement, and are often regarded by sailors as sea-serpents ; but when taken from the water the individuals of the group are easily detached. Thus, in conse- quence of accidents, separate members of these chains are often met with in seas abounding with these Molluscs ; but other, separate, Salpce are also met with that have never been united to others, and differ considerably in form from the associated ones (Jig. 772. a). Chamisso, however, discovered that such 2)ermanently solitary Salpce do not belong to species distinct from those united in chains, however dissimilar (and they are usually so dissimilar as to appear even generically dis- tinct), but are either the parents or the pro- geny, as the case may be, of the aggregate forms ; and that chained Salpce do not produce chained Salpce, but solitary Salpce, which in their turn do not produce solitary, but chained Salpce. Consequently, as Chamisso graphi- cally observed, " a i&z/pa-mother is not like its daughter or its own mother, but resembles its sister, its grand-daughter, and its grand- mother."* This family is mainly represented by the * Forbes, British BIolluscs, p. 48.TUNICATA. 1193 genus Salpa, Forskahl; synonyms Thalia, Brown ; Holothuria, Linneand Pallas ; Dagysa, Banks and Solander ; Biphora, Brugiere ; Tethis, Tilesius ; Pcgca and Iasis, Savigny. The characteristic features of this genus are detailed above. Quoy and Gaimard * established for some animals nearly allied to the Salpes and inha- biting the coasts of Amboina, the genus Do- liolium, the characters of which are, its having the form of a little cask open at the ends; from two to ten lines in length ; the anterior extremity a little prominent ; marked with circles in relief on the external surface; and having internal branchia, divided into two branches; and a heart and a dorsal vessel, si- tuated near the union of these branches. This name had also been previously given by Otto-j- to a genus established by him on a Mediterra- nean Salpa, mutilated by a crustacean of the genus Phronymc, that had made it its habita- tion. This form, like Salpa triangularis and S. polymorpha (by Quoy and Gaimard, and Bory de Vincent), has been erroneously regarded as belonging to the family of JDiphydes. MM. Lowig and Kolliker, however, who found the tissue of Doliolium to be identical with the pe- culiar substance of the test of other Tunicata, have pointed out its true affinities, and placed it with the Salpidce. Family Pelonaiadte, Forbes.— This fa- mily is represented by two rare animals, both inhabitants of the Scottish seas, constituting two species of a single genus, Pelonaia, esta- blished by Professor E. Forbes and Professor Goodsir.J We have derived our description of the general and anatomical characters of these interesting Molluscs from the detailed account given of them by the original dis- coverers. Genus Pelonaia, Forbes and Goodsir. — Animal simple, unattached. Test more or less cartilaginous, smooth or wrinkled, elon- gated, and cylindrical ; anterior extremity bearing two orifices, four-cleft, without ten- tacles, and placed on the same plane, on two equal, approximate, papillose eminences ; posterior extremity ending in a blunt point ; mantle adherent to the test. The Pelonake live buried in mud, quite unattached to any other body, and are extremely apathetic ani- mals, presenting scarcely any appearance of motion. Anatomy and Physiology of the Tuni- cata. It will be most convenient to describe the test generally for the whole tunicate class, and the rest of their anatomy under the heading of each of the families. Test or Shell. — The test or external enve- lope of the Ascidiada; is subject to considerable variation of shape ; from the bottle-like form of the Ascidia { fig. 766.), to the flat, patella- like form of Chelyosoma (fig. 767.) ; it is elastic, * Voyage de 1'Astrolabe, Zoologie, torn. iii. f Nova Acta Academ. Nat. Curios, t. xi. % Jameson's Edinb. New Philosoph. Journal, vol. xxxi. 184.1. varying very much in its thickness and con- sistence in different species. In colour it varies considerably, being occasionally nearly black, sometimes red, orange, yellow, or milky white. Its surface is sometimes smooth, often tuberculated, covered with hairs or spines, or otherwise roughened. Sometimes minute patches of horny tissue or hardened epidermis rise up irregularly on the surface of the test; in other cases these are placed in a tessellated arrangement. In the peculiar and unique form, Chelyosoma, first noticed by Messrs. Broderip and Sowerby, and since more fully described by Professor Eschricht, the upper surface of the test is occupied by eight large, horny, polygonal plates arranged some- what like the shell-plates of a tortoise, and by several smaller triangular plates, which form two circles, one around the branchial, and the other round the anal aperture of the animal (fig. 767.). The large plates are so disposed that the branchial orifice is surrounded by three plates, and the anal by four, besides that which is intermediate and abuts upon both: this latter plate is hexagonal, the sides in con- tact with the orificial valvules are lunated. The three plates near the branchial orifice are much larger than the four which are near to the anal orifice. Each of the plates is marked with three or four elevated striae, which are near to the edges of the plate, and parallel with them, leaving an area in the centre, and giving rise to a general resemblance to the external plates of the shell of a land tortoise. The orifices are very small, and are surrounded by six triangular valvules, each transversely stri- ated, and, when shut, rising from the sur- rounding surface in the form of a cone. The lower or adherent part of the test of Chely- osoma is coriaceous, with occasional slight traces of separation into plates. The test of Ascidia; is frequently covered with innumerable smaller animals and their spawn. Modiola; and Annelids burrow in it; Cirrhipeds, naked Molluscs, and Actinia; lodge upon it ; and Corallines cover it sometimes with a little forest ; a condition fully justify- ing the denomination of " microcosmus," be- stowed by Kedi * on a Mediterranean species. Occasionally, as in Ascidia conchilega and H fol- gida oculata, the animal works up extraneous matter, as gravel, fragmentary shells, &c., with the external surface of the test. It is by this shell or test that the animal fixes itself. In the sessile species, the tissue of the base or the side of the test interlaces with the stems of sea weeds and corallines, or closely adheres to the surface of another aseidian sac, or of a stone, a shell, a crab, or other object. In the peduncled forms this tunic is at one point pro- longed into a tubular process or stem, the dis- tal extremity of which is attached to marine bodies in the same manner as the base of the sessile tests. In Cystingia and Bipapillaria, however, this process or stalk appears to be less perfectly developed, and not to be al- * Opuscula varia Physiologica, 3 vols. 12mo. Iaigd. Batav. 1725.1194 TUNIC ATA. together adapted to maintain a permanent attachment to a fixed body. The external envelope of the Ascidiadce is always perforated by the two apertures characteristic of the Tunicata, and analogous to the prolonged respiratory orifices of the Cardiacees and other Acephala. One of these apertures *, nearly always placed at the sum- mit of the test, receives the sea-water, and admits it into the branchial cavity. The second aperture f is placed a little lower than the first, and is in communication with the rectum and oviduct. In Boltcnia the ori- fices are lateral; in Cystingia the branchial orifice is lateral, and the anal terminal; the oral orifice being always the highest in relative position, and nearest to the insertion of the pedicle by which the animal is suspended. In Chclyosoma and Dendrodoa the orifices are placed on the same plane ; in the former, on the nearly flat superior surface of the animal, and in the latter they are terminal. The edges of the orifices are more or less crenulate or divided. The branchial orifice is 8-9 rayed, and the anal 6 rayed, in Phal- lusia ; boih orifices are 4-fid in Cynthia, Bol- tenia, and Dendrodoa. When contracted, they are thrown into longitudinal folds ; this is the more observable when the orifices are somewhat prolonged into tubes. The test receives from the body blood- vessels, which its semitransparency in some species allows the eye to follow to the extreme ramifications. In the thinner tests the vessels are but few, and sometimes altogether escape observation; but in the thick pellucid test of Ascidia mammillata the eye can discern an extensive network of vascular ramifications. The bloodvessels enter the test near the base. The internal surface of the test has often a glistening and pearly appearance, and is always lined with an epithelium. In Boltenia reni- J'ormis this is a loose tissue, and forms a slight attachment to the external surface of the mus- cular sac or mantle of the body. In A. mammillata a thin vertical septum traverses a part of the cavity of the test. The test of the ClaveUinidce is very similar in consistence and general appearance to that of some of the more delicate species of the Ascidiadce, but differs materially in having tu- bular prolongations running from its base, which are traversed by vessels continuous from one individual to another, and from which root-like processes young individuals are continually being produced by the process of gemmiparous reproduction (Jig. 768.). The tube-like test of the Sa/pidce is " semicar- tilaginous, or gelatinous, seeming as if carved in crystal," its transparency rendering conspi- cuous the brilliant hues of the liver of the contained animal. It is usually more or less angular, bearing elongated crests, denticles, and other processes, by means of which the cohesion of the aggregated individuals is maintained (Jig. 772.). * The first, oral, buccal, branchial, or respiratory, t The second, anal, ventral, or the funnel. The tests of the little animals of which the cylindrical body of the Pyrosoma is composed, are intimately connected by their lateral sur- faces, leaving their terminal orifices free (Jig. 78C. a). The tissue of the whole common envelope is semicartilaginous, transparent, tinted with azure and other colours. In the Botryllidcc the external tunic is re- presented by the tegumentary tissue com- mon to the whole association of animals, and which may perhaps be compared to the polypary of aggregated Polyps. The close aggregation of the animals causes a fusion, as it were, of the tests of the whole into a coriaceous or gelatinous mass, coated with a tough epidermic membrane, and more or less regularly beset with individuals or groups of individuals (systems) ; or, rather, the soft test of the originally isolated indivi- dual, or single system, increasing in bulk and producing within itself more and more embryos of individuals and systems, becomes an ex- tended, homogeneous mass, in which nu- merous individuals are lodged (Jig. 771.). This mass is irregular, fungous, jelly-like, spongy, or coriaceous, incrusting other sessile Tuni- cates and a variety of marine bodies. Structure and chemical composition of the test. — We are indebted to the labours of MM. Lo- wigand Kolliker* for considerable information on the subject of the constituent elements and the growth of the test of the simple and the compound Ascidians. These researches were undertaken with the view of examining into Dr. Schmidt's statement of the existence of the vegetable element " cellulose" in the tissue of the ascidian envelope. This they found to be correct (as the following state- ments will show), and they have also offered a lucid explanation of the fact, to which we shall subsequently refer. Cellulose forms the cell walls of vegetables, and is unaffected either by soda or hydrochloric acid. The cartilaginous envelope of Phallusia mammillaris (Fam. Ascidiadce), examined in specimens preserved in spirit, is composed of three layers of different thicknesses (Jig.773-). The internal layer, formed simply of polygonal, nucleated, epithelial cells, measuring 0-005"', covers all the interior surface of the test; at the two external orifices, and at the points where it receives the nutrient vessels of the test, it is united with another epithelial tissue covering the mantle. The second layer is con- siderably thicker, and is composed of a homo- geneous substance, containing crystals and nuclei. The former are not present every- where, and are, perhaps, quite absent in the recent animals ; when present they are visible to the naked eye, and appear like white strias; seen under a moderately magnifying power, they have the form of crystals united in the form of a star, or of irregular and polymor- phous concretions. The nuclei are present in considerable numbers and under different forms ; those situated towards the interior are round, 0-0015'"—0002'", with one or two * Annalcsdes Sciences Katuxelles, 3 se'r. torn. vi. 184G.1195 TUNICATA. opaque nucleoli, similar to fat-granules. The external nuclei are larger, round or more or less produced, and contain clear or granular substance, and usually some opaque granules. Fig. 773. A B Test of Phallusia mammiUaris. A.

A portion of the same, magnified 350 times, a, fundamental mass; 6, cellulose cells; c, nuclei, some round, others star-shaped; d, acicular crystals of carbonate of lime ; e, the extremity of a vessel; /, pigment-cells. The third layer forms the principal mass of the test of this species. It is the seat of the numerous and large arteries, which, arising from the heart, traverse it in every direction, having brush-like ramifications, that penetrate almost to the exterior surface, and then ap- pear to pass into other vessels that accom- pany them in their course. This layer is formed of large cells, besides a clear homo- geneous substance, which is a continuation of the principal substance of the second layer ; besides these there are locally distributed crys- tals, nuclei, and pigment-cells. The large cells, which R.Wagner previously thought to be cartilaginous, are of a peculiar nature, and resemble no other animal cell hitherto known, except perhaps those of the chorda dorsalis of some animals. The most re- markable character of these cells is their size, which varies from 0'008" to 0'05"', the aver- age being 0<02'" to 0-03'". Their form is spherical, pyriform, or elliptical ; their con- tents diaphanous and quite destitute of nucleus or granules : and their membrane delicate, smooth, and of an equal thickness throughout. The smallest cells are irregularly dispersed in the homogeneous fundamental mass that is common to the second and third layers. The larger cells are arranged closely together to- wards the exterior surface of the layer, pre- senting a very regular cellular tissue with very little intermediate substance; but, immediately beneath the external surface of the envelope, the cells are rather more distant one from another, and the intermediate tissue more visible. The crystals and pigment-cells before mentioned, are present only in the outer part of this third layer ; the former are acicular, about O'OOlo'" in length, occupying in com- pact masses the intercellular intervals ; the latter are yellow, and filled with somewhat large granules, and surround in particular the extreme ramifications of the vessels. The nuclei, lastly, are similar to the large nuclei of the second or intermediate layer, and are everywhere present between the large cells in considerable numbers. When slices of the test are treated with hy- drochloric acid, the crystals of the second and third layers quickly disappear; treated with a solution of soda, the epithelial cells, the nuclei, the pigment-cells, and the vessels arc dissolved. The fundamental homogeneous sub- stance of the second and third layers and the large cells are not dissolved, nor do they suffer any modification. In Phallusia monachus the large cells mea- sure from 0 01'" to 0"02'", and are more dis- tinctly separated from one another than in the preceding example. The nuclei of the homo- geneous substance are few, and generally fusi- form or even ramified ; at the external surface of the envelope they are mixed up with a great number of minute yellow pigment-cells and pigmentary granules, as well as with acicu- lar crystals and very minute crystalline concre- tions ; all of these being in the greatest num- bers in the neighbourhood of the extremities of the vessels. In one specimen of this spe- cies MM. Lowig and Kolljker observed, that in the interior of the third layer no cells could be distinguished ; ultimately, however, they distinctly saw well defined cavities or lacuna;, which were evidently vestiges of cells that had been more or less completely fused with the intermediate homogeneous substance ; and the traces of these lost cells were found to be- more and more distinct towards the band of perfect cells in the surface of the test. In Phallusia sulcata the large round or ellip- tical cells, without nuclei, have a diameter of 001'"—0-15'". In Phallusiagelatinosa a very peculiar forma- tion was observed by the experimenters. In one specimen the soft, gelatinous substance of the envelope exhibited no trace of cells throughout its thickness, but its mass was principally composed of a homogeneous sub- stance similar to that of the other Ascidiaz, In another individual they observed some few and indefinite remains of cells. In both spe- cimens they found, as in the other species, vessels and nuclei, the latter for the most part round and measuring 0-002w, in the homo- geneous substance. In the individual desti- tute of cells, there was also in the exterior part a very large quantity of acicular crystals and yellow granules, the latter frequently re- sembling the nuclei with large coloured nu- cleoli. The tissue in all the Ascidke examined, when chemically treated, behaved in a similar manner to that of Phallusia mammiUaris. We have observed that the test of Boltenia reniformis (preserved in spirit) presents a ho-1196 TUNICATA. mogeneous structure crowded with " nuclei" and bloodvessels, and only occasionally does any trace of cellular tissue present itself, in which case the cells are very minute, poly- gonal, and compressed. Mr. J. Quekett has detected calcareous spiculse in the test of this species. They are situated towards the ex- terior, and are very numerous and excessively minute. Their form is usually cylindrical, with triradiate or 4-5-fid extremities.* The composition of the test of ClaveUina lepadiformis corresponds in all respects to that of the above mentioned Ascidice; certain parts in the same individual having a more particular resemblance to one species, and others to another. The test, however, is quite destitute of bloodvessels. Transverse sections of the stalk of the ClaveUina and of the excrescences that spring from it, exhibit a tissue composed of round or elongated non-nucleated cells, 0-01,//—0-014"', almost destitute of inter- mediate tissue, and arranged very close to one another. It is only towards the upper extremity of the stalk that the cells become more and more separate, and even disappear little by little, as happens in some Ascidice, and give place to an intermediate homogeneous substance, bear- ing a quantity of nuclei. In the largest and superior moiety of the test a peculiar structure is found. Externally is a dense, but not thick, layer of delicate cells, which are very difficult to recognise, and measure about 0-02"'. Be- tween the cells, and immediately at the surface, are crystals of carbonate of lime, scattered nuclei (measuring 0-002"'), and large round fatty granules. Interiorly to this occurs a still thinner lamina, composed of a trans- parent, colourless, homogeneous substance, with infinitely minute pale granules. Next, there is a layer of round granules or vesicles. These are spherical, measuring 0'0005'", 0-0004'", and even 0-005'"; their surface is smooth or granulated; the largest are placed in the middle, the smallest at the exterior; they appear opaque, and like starch or fat granules. With solution of iodine, they be- come yellowish, without presenting any trace of blue, and are probably fat grains. Succeeding to these, a thick layer presents itself, homogeneous, diaphanous, with some few minute spherical nuclei, which, the nearer they approach towards the interior, contain more and more colourless granules. Lastly, quite at the interior surface, is athinnish, com- pletely diaphanous substance, of equal thick- ness throughout, with spherical granular nuclei, measuring about 0-003"'. Treated with soda and with hydrochloric acid, the crystals, nuclei, and fat granules of the test of the ClaveUina disappear; the large cells, on the contrary, and the homogeneous substance, with its scattered granules, remain perfectly unaffected, proving the identity of the chemical composition in Ascidia and Cla- veUina. * Several specimens are figured by Mr. Quekett in the Descript. and Illustr. Catal. of the Histological Series in the Mus. Royal Coll. Surgeons, 18-19, plate xvii. fig. 13. The Salpa maxima does not contain, in its gelatinous envelope, any trace of cells similar to those of the Phallusia and ClaveUina. It is for the most part composed of a homogeneous, clear, diaphanous substance. Towards the interior surface, the several elements are not so clearly arranged as in the middle and external layers. In the innermost layers, a multitude of very minute granules are pre- sent; in the others there are little round nuclei, nucleated cells, and spherical or star- shaped crystalline concretions. These latter are very regular, and formed of 3—7 straight rays, springing from a centre (Jig. 774. c). They Fig. 774. A.

(After Milne-Edwards.} are composed of a single or manifold series of granules, which, as they approach the exterior, increase or lessen in number, but always di- minish in size. These do not appear to be car- bonate of lime, not being soluble in hydro- chloric acid ; and their behaviour with muriate of barytes shows that they are not formed of sulphate of lime ; probably they are siliceous. The granules and nuclei are dissolved by boil- ing in solution of soda j but the homogeneous substance, composing the mass of the tunic, remains unchanged. The test ot'Salpa bicaudata is essentially the same, in the nature of its composition, as thatTUNICATA. 1197 of the Salpa maxima, the fundamental mass of the gelatinous envelope being composed of the homogeneous substance. It differs, however, in the elements contained in this tissue, and by the presence of a simple layer of epithelial cells, covering it on the interior surface of the test. In the interior layer of the homoge- neous substance there are granulated vesi- cles, having a diameter of O003'" to 0-004/", sometimes having the appearance of nuclei, and sometimes that of cells. In the middle part, here and there, are scattered round or fusiform nuclei; and in the exterior layer are little crystals, round nuclei, and peculiar concretions, similar to those of Salpa maxima. Some of these concretions are small, elegantly ramified, and disposed horizontally ; others are larger, ramified in a brush-like form, and appearing to the naked eye as white tufts. These latter commence at the surface, descend vertically towards the interior, and ultimately form a tuft of fine ramified rays {fig. 775. d).

Magnified 350 times, these two sorts of con- cretions are seen to be composed of opaque granules of different sizes. The chemical composition of the test of this Salpa is iden- tical with that of the preceding species. In the Pyrosoma giganteum, the common en- velope of the individuals is also formed of a homogeneous and structureless substance. In its interior are scattered here and there round nuclei, and some ramified cells, similar to those of the loose cellular tissue of the em- bryos of Mammifers, for example, to that of the gelatine of Wharton. Both of these latter elements disappear when treated with soda; but the homogeneous substance al- together resists the action of the soda, and remains intact. The Diazona violacea (Fam. Botryllidcc') possesses, in the gelatinous mass of the com- mon test, a diaphanous, structureless sub- stance, quite destitute of cells. In the ex- terior layers are crystals and concretions of carbonate of lime, vesicles with violet-coloured granules, fat granules, and, particularly to- wards the interior, a great quantity of minute round vesicles (nuclei). Treated with hy- drochloric acid and with soda, the crystals, nuclei, and pigment-cells are dissolved, but the homogeneous substance remains un- changed. Moreover, after having been a long time exposed to the influence of the alkali, and although the pigment-cells have disap- peared, some portions of the exterior parts retain a pale violet tint, giving evidence of the presence of undissolved colouring particles, and of an amorphous colouring matter per- vading the mass. The structure of the test of Didemnum can- didum (Fam. Botryttidce) is quite different from that met with in any of the Tunicates before mentioned. The white substance in which the individual animals are lodged, which has been figured also by Savigny, apparently pre- sents only some white star-shaped bodies {fig. 774. a), measuring 0-006'" to 0-015'", similar to those found by M. Milne-Edwards, in Leptoclinum stellatum and L. maculosuni {fig. 774. d), except only that the former are of a more rounded form, and are provided with shorter and more numerous points.* But, on being treated with hydrochloric acid, this substance has quite another appearance. The white colour quickly disappears, bubbles of gas being freely given oft"; and, on ex- amination with the microscope, there is seen in the yellowish, transparent membrane that remains, a fundamental homogeneous sub- stance, in which are scattered round and elongated cells, of 0-005"'— 0-013"' in di- ameter, and some minute granular masses. At first sight these cells appear to be analo- gous to the large cells found in the tests of Ascidia and Clavellina, being, like those of the latter, non-nucleated, indistinctly marked by a pale, delicate contour, and having perfectly liquid contents. But by boiling with soda they are quite dissolved, whereas the homo- geneous substance remains unchanged. MM. Lowig and Kolliker found also, that under the influence of hydrochloric acid each of the star- like corpuscles showed itself not to be a simple concretion, but, losing its rays little by little, became a cell filled with lime, and ultimately appeared as a colourless, empty cell, quite similar to those above described. They add that they could not discover how these curious cells, filled with lime, and fur- nished with calcareous rays externally, were formed ; but they thought it probable that they were originally large cells, full of liquid, which became gradually occupied with lime, until ultimately the membrane of the cell became incrusted, and the lime deposited on its external surface. * We have been favoured by Mr. Bowerbank with an opportunity of examining his valuable series of microscopical preparations of ascidian tis- sues, including several kinds of the spicule entering into the composition of the tests. The spicula? of Didemman are spherical bodies, closely invested with short, thick, blunt spines, and nearly resemble the globular spicute of Tethea, except that the invest- ing spines of the latter are more numerous and much liner. The tissue occupied by these closely set spicula? in the Didemnum is seen in the trans- parent portions of Mr. Bowerbank's beautifully mounted specimens to be composed of diaphanous, contiguous, irregularly hexagonal cells, the measure- ments of which we have not had time to effect. Xumerous nucleoli are disseminated throughout the tissue.TUN1CATA. 1198 The common test of Aplidium gibbulosum presents a homogeneous substance with some scattered nuclei, and a great quantity of round cells, with very delicate membranes, measur- ing 0-005'" to 0-013'", and even to 0-02'". Those in the interior contain only a liquid ; but the nearer they approach the exterior, the more are they found to contain calcareous concretions; and, lastly, there are cells per- fectly incrusted, but without appendages. Acted upon by soda and by hydrochloric acid, the homogeneous substance alone remains, the rest is dissolved. In the "common body" of Botryttus vio- laceus are some remarkably incrusted cells, similar in some respects to those of Dtdemnum. Some of these are perfectly round, with a diameter of 0 009"', and, as those of Aplidium, are filled with calcareous concretions ; others, for the most part pyriform or fusiform, have one or two pointed, colourless prolongations, O'OOG'"— 0-009'" in length, and are organic in substance; others, lastly, round or tetra- liedral, have even three or four of these prolongations, which are often of a similar length, and are regularly disposed, but just as often are of different sizes, and without sym- metry {fig.ll-i. b).* These prolonged cells are probably analogous to the round cells in Dtdemnum, that have lime in their interior and calcareous deposits externally, and may even be compared with vegetable cells (pollen- granules, spores, &c), bearing external de- posits. Were these cells incrusted, they would form star-like bodies, similar to those of the Didemnum, Professor M. Ed wards observes, that in Lcp- toclinum the substance of the tissue is crowded with calcareous granules, which, seen with an ordinary lens, appear to be little spherical con- cretions, but which are aggregations of little pyramidal crystals, united by their base, so as to represent a many-rayed star, surmounted on each of its faces by a group of other similar, but smaller, rays (see Jig. 774. d). The structure of the common test of the Botryttus polycyclus is peculiar and quite dif- ferent from those described above. In the exterior parts of the common mass the struc- ture resembles that ordinarily found in com- pound Ascidians, being of a clear and homo- geneous substance, with some nuclei and crys- tals ; but in the interior distinct fibres are found, by the side of the nuclei. These fibres are of two kinds; some, the least numerous, are long, extremely pale and delicate, too fine to be measured, and, crossing one another in all directions, form elegant sinuosities ; others, less numerous,are short, 0-01,'" to0-03'"in length, larger, opaque, and variously curved; in a word, they resemble certain nuclei transformed into fibres (Kenifasern). Like the homoge- neous substance of the exterior and interior parts, these fibres resist the action of hydro- chloric acid and of soda ; and consequently, * Specimens of these spicula in Mr. Bowerbank's histological collection exhibit much more coarsely granulated centres than those here figured. since they are incontestably organic, they are composed of non-azotised substance. There are also some round points, visible to the naked eye, dispersed in the common in- tegument of this Botryttus. Some are white, generally situated towards the interior of the test, and appear under the microscope as groups of granules or spiculae ; they are in- soluble in a solution of soda, or in hydro- chloric acid, and are probably siliceous, like the concretions in Saijoa. The other spots are violet-coloured, or reddish, and are most abundant in the external layers near the groups of individuals, yet sometimes also they are present in the interior parts of the common mass. Seen under the microscope, they appear as pyriform, round, or elongated vesicles, bearing a reddish colouring matter, contained probably in the cells, and are at- tached to the extremities of the ramifying canals that traverse the mass in every direc- tion. These vesicles are the germs of new individuals.* The coriaceous test of the Cynthia; (Fam. Ascidiadce) presents a composition still more remarkable than that of the Bolrylli. In Cynthia papillata, the fibres that constitute a large proportion of the test, are in some parts so much developed, that they may bear compari- son with the fibrils of any fibrous tissue found in vertebrate animals. In examining the structure of the test, w here it is of no great thickness, we find a simple lamina, quite on the interior surface, consist- ing of an epithelium, with polygonal cells, which is united to the mantle by scattered, crossing, muscular fibres. A thick layer of fibres suc- ceeds, having cells and nuclei disseminated in it. The fibres themselves are colourless, un- dulating, resembling the fibrils of the fibrous tissue of vertebrate animals, but narrower; they measure 0-0002'"—0-0004'" in thick- ness ; they are never ramified, nor united into bundles. In their direction they are in part parallel to the axis of the animal, as in the interior laminae; and in part differently in- terlaced, so that some are disposed longi- tudinally, and others transversely (circular and longitudinal fibres); hence, from the disposition of the two kinds of layers, the test can very easily be split into, sometimes very delicate, laminae. There is apparently no intermediate substance accompanying the fibres, but the laminae formed by their diver- gences are occupied by a quantity of granules and vesicles of different forms. Firstly, there are minute colourless molecules, in some parts so abundant as to render the fibres in- distinct, and to give to some of the thicker layers a finely granular aspect; secondly, crystals, which are present only in the ex- terior layers ; thirdly, nuclei, measuring 0-001'" to 0 00.3'", often with large granules, apparently of fat; fourthly, cells of different forms. Some of these cells, containing nuclei * The epiderm covering the common gelatinous test of Botryttus stellatus is very tough, closely ad- herent, and presents distinct cellular structure.TUNICATA. 1199 and brown pigment-grannies, are rounil, having a diameter of O'OOS"' to 0-01'", or elon- gated, with a diameter of 0"006'// to 0-008'"; others are of a pale colour, and, from the double nuclei and the included cells (2 to 7) seen in some of them, strongly resemble the cartilage-cells of the superior animals. This resemblance is rendered the more strik- ing by the round or elongate form of these cells, by the peculiar arrangement of the en- closed cells, and by the union of some of the mother-cells, in this case generally round and smaller, into groups of two or four. This resemblance, however, is only external, and due only to the fact that the cells increase by formation in the interior, as in cartilage; because more exact observations show that these cells, by further transitions, become identical with the simpler pigment- cells described above, and are only the more developed forms of the latter, the pigment having disappeared by degrees on account of the condition of their growth. The third layer is formed of a yellowish, horny epidermis. The thin hairs which cover the surface of the Cynthia papillata are formed by this and the exterior fibrous layer. At certain spots a bundle of fibres springs up from the plane surface of the latter, which, being coated with the horny epidermis, rises on the surface as small needle-shaped bodies. Where the test of the Cynthia attains a thick- ness of i to \\"' and more, its composition often changes in a remarkable manner (Jig. 770.). In this case the epithelium is succeeded Fig. 776. 1 O t2 s | ® s « a * <= o Transverse section of Cynthia papillata, magnified 100 times. (After Lowig and KiHUher.) 1, Internal layer of epithelium; 2, second layer, homogeneous, with pigment-cells; 3, third layer, composed of alternate layers of radiating fibres and fibres parallel to the surface of the test; 4, fourth layer, fibres parallel to the surface of the test; 5, spines; a, the thin yellowish outer surface; b, fibrous nuclei. by a clear, homogeneous, structureless mass, of a moderate thickness, with scattered pigment- cells and nuclei. Next is a fine fibrous tissue, composed of a great number of thin layers of circular fibres, without cells or nuclei, and of radiating fibres that unite these layers ; this passes externally into an irregular fibrous tissue, covered with a horny epidermis. Where this peculiar stratification of fibres exists, the test is not separable into laminae, because the radiating fibres firmly connect the thin layers of circular fibres. Treated with hydrochloric acid and with soda, the test of Cynthia is rendered quite white. The pigment-cells, the coloured epi- dermis, the mother-cells, the crystals, the epithelium, the nuclei, and the granules are dissolved, and there remain only the fibres and the homogeneous substance that exists here and there. These two elements, then, are composed of cellulose. The structure of the thick test of the Cynthia Canopus is very similar to the above. Interiorly there is an epithelium, then a thick layer of longitudinal and circular fibres, some- what indistinctly stratified, in which, towards the exterior, crystals and largish round bodies, composed apparently of groups of cells, are disseminated; lastly, a thin iayer of solid, whitish epidermis, with little conical papillae, usually accompanied by processes from the fibrous layer. The thick fibrous layer, only, resists the action of hydrochloric acid and of soda ; all the rest is dissolved without any residue. Cynthia pomaria presents, as the chief ma- terial of its test, a layer of fibres similar to those previously described, having chiefly a longitudinal direction. Between the fibres are crystals, round pigment-cells, measuring 0 004"'to 0-006'", and further, here and there, peculiar elongated cells, filled with yellow granules, measuring 0-008'" and more. In- ternally, and adhering to the fibrous layer, is a simple epithelium, with polygonal cells that have diameters of 0-006'" to 0-008'". This adheres to the inner tunic by means of mus- cular fibres. Externally the fibrous layer is covered by a yellowish, solid layer of unde- termined structure. In the interior parts of the fibrous layer occurs a somewhat large number of peculiar cells, apparently not ana- logous to any other of animal or vegetable structure. These cells are primitively similar to pigment-cells, and round, but possessing a thicker membrane, and without any apparent nucleus. Subsequently they grow, preserving their shape, to the size of 0-01"'. The mem- brane at the same time continues to thicken, so much so that the cavity of the cell increas- ing but slightly, the membrane attains a thick- ness of 0-004'". Lastly, the size of the cell increases to 0-02'" and the thickness of the membrane to 0-006'". Whilst this develop- ment is going on, fine lines are observable in the thickened cell-membrane, and ultimately the membrane is transformed into fibres, so that one may see the moderately sized cells in their cavities, and yet occupied by pigment1200 TUNICATA. or by pale granules, enveloped with an elegant skein of fine, cylindrical, opaque fibres, which can be isolated by compression. Whether the fibres have a spiral arrangement is uncertain. MM. Lowig and Kolliker, who discovered these remarkable fibre-coated cells, remark that, as to the manner in which this curious trans- formation of the pigment-cells is brought about, the increase of thickness in the cell- membrane would take place by growth, or by a development similar to that which occurs in many vegetable cells, the membrane of which consists of several layers, or by the de- position of a substance applied externally. As there is no appearance of any internal or external deposit, and as the cell-cavity is not diminished during the thickening of its walls, they consider the first to be the more likely cause of the above conditions, but, neverthe- less, not sufficient alone to account for the circumstances. It is difficult, perhaps, to say how these fibres are formed, but it may be that the cell-walls, by partial solidification, ultimately become separable into fibres. The fibrous tissue of the Cynthia pomaria is insoluble in hydrochloric acid, or in solution of soda ; the other elements of the test, sub- mitted to these agents, disappear. The following clever abstract of the facts connected with the subject has been drawn up by Professor Edward Forbes : — " MM. Lowig and Kolliker found cellulose undoubtedly present in the envelopes of many Tunicata, both simple and compound, in- cluding the genera Phallusia, Cynthia, Cla- vellina, Diazona, Botryllus, Pyrosoma, and Salpa ; but they sought in vain for cellulose in animals of inferior organisation, although in some of the above-named creatures it formed a very considerable part of the animal tissues. " The" Memoir of MM. Lowig and Kolliker was examined by a committee of the French Institute, consisting of Dumas,Milne-Edwards, Boussingault, and Payen ; the last-named eminent philosopher drew up the report. In it he gives the following formula of the com- position of the envelopes of the Tunicata: — Cellulose ... 60-34 Azotised substance - 27'00 Inorganic matter - - 12'66 10000 " He remarks that the establishment of the existence of cellulose in the Tunicata is a 'fait capital' in science, very important in its bearing on future researches into the com- parative physiology of the two kingdoms. " The explanation offered by Lciwig and Kolliker of these very anomalous facts is ex- tremely ingenious, and probably very near the truth. It is to the following effect:— Tuni- cata live entirely upon vegetable organisms. The contents of the stomachs of the Phal- lusia:, ClavellincE, and Diazona?, examined, con- sisted of particles of florideous algae, which had probably found their way there by chance, and a great quantity of microscopic plants of low position in the series, species of Navicula, Fritstulia, Baccilaria, Clostcrium, &c. These minute vegetable organisms have been shown by Nageli and Schmidt to contain cellulose. " This is probably dissolved by the gastric juice, that is to say, changed into sugar or gum, in which state it circulates with the blood, and is afterwards introduced into the tunics, either directly by the sanguiferous canals (as in Phallusia), or by their prolonga- tions ramified in the walls of the common body (as in Diazona and Botryllus), which thus, as Milne-Edwards has shown, contain also blood in their cavity, probably pene- trating by imbibition when the envelopes have no bloodvessels. The presence of cellulose in the tunics of the ascidian Molluscs, then, cannot be taken as an evidence of an ap- proach to a vegetable nature in those bodies. It affords us, however, a wholesome warning against the placing of confidence in asserted chemical distinctions between the great king- doms of Nature." * From the observations made by MM. Lowig and Kolliker on the histological characters of the embryos of certain compound Ascidians, they arrived at two important results. Firstly, that the external structureless envelope of the embryos, which,apparently,is identical with the external envelope of the adults, is, according to their analysis, composed of cellulose ; that this envelope is formed only when the division of the yolk is accomplished, and even when the exterior form of the embryo is indicated. Secondly, that this envelope, subsequently containing, as in Botryllus and in Ap/idium, another structureless substance, fibres, nuclei, and crystals, is primitively altogether homo- geneous and unorganised. Hence it appears that the test of the Tuni- cates is a product of the activity of cells formed subsequently to the process of the division of the vitellus, and that primitively it is only a mass secreted by these cells. Its ulterior organisation is not yet understood, but remains an open field for much interesting and im- portant research. Anatomy of the Ascidiad/E.—We have already referred to the external envelope of the Tunicates as being analogous to the cal- ciferous shells ortests of the other Acephalans; and the muscular sac enclosed within it, as the analogue of the mantle; and the membranous sac lining the mantle as analogous to the branchiae of the Acephalans. f The rest of the viscera of the Ascidians are enveloped in a peritoneumj, and the heart has, besides, its own membranous sac or pericar- dium. Thus the body, properly so called, appears as if divided into three cavities ; that of the branchiae, communicating with the exterior by the superior opening of the sac, * Hist. Brit. Molluscs, vol. i. p. 6. t According to Van Beneden, the longitudinal vessels of the branchia; of the Asridice are more par- ticularly the analogues of the ciliated tentacles of the Bryozoa. % The peritoneum of Ascidia intestinalis offers a good example, being of firm consistence, circum- scribing and protecting the abdomen. 01201 TUNICATA. and in the base of which opens the mouth; that of the peritoneum, which does not com- municate with the exterior by itself, but is traversed by the intestinal tube, which, arising in the branchial cavity, communicates with the exterior by the rectum and the anal aper- ture of the test ; and, lastly, that of the peri- cardium, which has no direct communication with the exterior. The position of the animal is always such, that of the two orifices the branchial is always the highest; the entrance into the branchial sac being generally placed at or near the superior extremity of the body, and the oeso- phageal opening, at the base of the branchial sac, having an upward direction. In Bvltenia and Cystingia the flexible peduncle, which is attached at the summit of the body, above the branchial orifice, allows the body to droop, thus giving the animal its normal position. In the ClavellinidcB, which have rigid peduncles continuous with the base of the test, the same normal relation of the internal parts is pre- served ; and although the intestinal loop in Boltenia and Clavellina is always directed to- wards the pedicle, yet this arises from the loop having, in the former an ascending, and in the latter a descending, direction. The muscular sac or mantle, enclosed in the external envelope, is attached to the in» ternal surface of the latter by an adhesion of the external surface of the extremities of its two tubular processes, which correspond to the two external orifices of the test, to the inner borders of these outer orifices {.fig. 780.). In Ascidia there is often no in- timate cohesion at these points, merely an adaptation easily disturbed after death. In Cynthia, Boltenia, &c, on the contrary, the test and the tubular prolongations are strongly adherent. Beside this mode of attachment, there is sometimes a general loose adhesion formed by the epithelial tissue between the surfaces of the test and mantle ; and in Cynthia papillata there is a partial transmission of mus- cular fibres from the latter to the former ; and, lastly, there is the very slight attachment arising from the passage of bloodvessels from the body to the test. This free condition of the mantle within the external sac occurs throughout the Asci- d'uukc, Clavellinidce, Botryllidce, and Pyroso- mides. In the Salpidce and the Pelonaiadee, on the other hand, the mantle and the test are connected at very many points, or even throughout the extent of their contiguous surfaces. The mantle in Chelyosoma is more closely attached to the internal surface of the test than in other Ascidians ; its muscular tissue forming intimate connections between the various plates of the external envelope, and not only supplying the valvular pieces of the apertures, but also edging each of the larger plates with interlacing connecting fibres. Ex- cept at these muscular spaces the mantle ap- pears as a thin serous membrane. The interval between these two sacs is, during life, filled with some fluid; possibly a VOL. IV. secretion, or transudation through the one or the other of these envelopes; for, except in the case of those Ascidians whose mantle- tubes are not intimately connected with the test, the sea-water cannot be directly admitted into this cavity. The mantle is reflected upon the body, properly so called, and covers it externally, just as the peritoneum, after having coated the walls of the abdomen, is reflected upon the intestines ; with this difference, however, that it has no mesentery, and that the con- nection is ordy at the two orifices. It has an external serous layer, continuous with the internal membrane of the test, a muscular tissue more or less extensive, and an internal serous layer. It has also numerous ramifica- tions of nerves and bloodvessels. In Boltenia, Cystingia, and probably Bipapillaria, a tubu- lar prolongation of the mantle traverses the peduncle. The two tubes on the superior aspect of the mantle, which are directed towards, and protruding into, the two somewhat tubular orifices of the test, are more muscular than the rest of the sac, being surrounded with, generally very distinct, sphincters in addition to the fascicles of muscles that traverse them longitudinally, and are continued diagonally across the sac (Jig. 780.). When open, the margins of these tubes are crenulate. The free extremity of the branchial orifice is some- times quite entire, but occasionally terminates in a circle of regular tooth-like processes, which are regarded bv Dr. A. Farre as the ana- logues of the tentacles of the Bryozoa. By con- traction, the tubes are thrown into 5 or 0 folds. At the exterior angles of these folds in some Ascidians (A. intestiualis, Cynthia ampulla, &c.) there is a minute red spot ; in A. mammillata, the edges of the folds are more or less red- dened by an increase and diffusion, as it were, of these little red granules. Internally each tube has frequently at its base some slight valve-like prominences or folds; and the in- ner extremity of the branchial tube is always fringed with a circlet of simple or compound tentacular filaments. These, however, mav more properly be said to belong to the bran- chial sac. The mantle becomes dusky and opaque, and its muscular tissue more distinctly seen, in preserved specimens. In its recent state it is more or less diaphanous, and usually of a sober tint ; but occasionally, in Ascidice, it is of a fine crimson (A. venosa"), or variegated with crimson and white (A. virgin nea), or spotted with red (A. aspersa) ; and in A. parallelogramma it is ornamented with rectangular reticulating white lines and occa- sional bright yellow or crimson spots. In A. conchilcga it is white, passing to blue ; and in A. arachnoidea it is dark blue. The branchiae of the Ascidiadcc is a large bag of fine vascu'ar network furnished with vibratil'e cilia, contained witlvn the mantle of the animal, and lining the walls of that cavity (fig. 778.). Sometimes the branchial sac is oblong, oval, or rectangular ; and then 4 H1202 TUNICATA. it occupies all the length and one of the sides of the cavity of the mantle (Cynthia). In Ascidia mammillata and A. monacha it is very long; and, after having descended to the bottom of the mantle, it is bent upwards upon itself, extending halfway up the cavity again. A tube, differing in size in various species, which has its analogue, perhaps, in the retrac- tile operculum of the Bryozoa, conducts the water from the buccal aperture to the respira- tory sac. This tube or process of the mantle encloses the neck of the branchial sac. At the inner extremity of the tube, where it widens into, and is continuous with, the bran- chial sac, are frequently observed about five small valvular folds; and below these there is always a circle of fleshy filaments or tentacular appendages {fig. 778. and Jig. 39 d. Vol. I. page 112. Animal Kingdom*). These are present also in the Clavellinidce and the Botryllidee. They vary from 6 to 26 in number, and are either simple, as in Phallusia, or branched, as in Cynthia, Bol- terda, &c. By detaching the anterior part of the respiratory sac of Cynthia, or others, and examining it from its inner and inferior aspect, one may perceive, at the inner mar- gin of the tube, several arboriform append- ages, somewhat large at the base, and having the branches either swollen at their extremi- ties, or finely laciniate and almost plumiform : in Cynthia Dione they are somewhat bipinnate. The number of the tentacles is difficult to he arrived at, as smaller filaments appear amongst the six or seven larger ones. The branches are generally directed downwards, towards the bottom of the sac, but sometimes are slightly curled upwards. Seen under the mi- croscope, these filaments are hollow; and the extremities and swellings of the branches are cul-de-sacs. The several tentacles intercom- municate with each other by their hollow bases, and with the vascular network of the respiratory sac. The walls of these tubular organs are very thin and transparent ; traces of muscular fibre have been detected in their substance, and a circulation ; but no trace of vibratile cilia, either on their outside or within their cavity. Van Beneden observes that a fluid traverses their cavity in a similar manner to the blood in the branchiae of the Doris. In Actinia and Holothuria simple and ramified filaments occur, that offer considerable analo- gies to the arborescent tentacles of Ascid'us. They are all hollow; and the fluid moving in their interior comes directly from the peri- intestinal cavity ; this great cavity, commu- nicating as in Bryozoa, with the tentacular appendages. The internal surface of the respiratory sac is sometimes uniform (in Ascidia, Phallusia, Sec), and frequently longitudinally plicated and disposed in deep and regular folds, all following the curve of the cavity, and termi- * This figure represents a Cynthia carwpus cut open ; a, oesophagus; b, stomach; c, anus; d, external anal orifice, closed; e, branchial orifice, laid open ; f, branchial tentacles ; </, nerve-ganglion ; h, dorsal sinus; k, ovary(?); indeterminate bodies. nating at a little smooth area above the pha- rynx (Cynthia, Boltenia, Sec). The folds are from 8 to 18 in number, and form the first indication of the four branchial laminas of the bivalve Acephalans. The structure of the membrane consists of an infinity of small, anastomosing vessels, generally cross- ing each other at right angles, and forming quadrangular interspaces, which, under the microscope, are seen to be still more mi- nutely subdivided in the same manner. Milne- Edwards observes that in Phallusia each of the meshes of the respiratory membrane is occu- pied by a minute spiracle, that allows of a communication between the interior of the branchial sac and the cavity of the mantle (the " thoracic chamber " of Milne-Edwards), the dorsal portion of this chamber being the cloaca, the base of which is occupied by the orifices of the digestive and generative tubes, and the summit of which opens externally by the anal aperture. In Cynthia ampulla the meshes are very irregular and almost inextri- cable, some of the minute vessels having apparently a spiral arrangement; and the vessels are rather more numerously disposed around the oesophageal orifice. A somewhat spiral or vermicular arrangement of the ex- tremities of the branchial vessels exists also in Chelyosoma, as figured by Eschricht; * and as seen in a very minute sessile Ascidia, from South America, in the collection of Mr. Bower- bank. In the respiratory network of Cynthia the large longitudinal vessels are seen to be the most prominent of all. They form, with the large transverse vessels, square meshes, which three other shorter vessels subdivide into four transverse meshes; and these are further intercepted by extremely fine longitudinal vessels. The vertical vessels of this quadran- gular network may be said to arise from the transverse vessels, which communicate by each extremity with two vertical trunks, placed at opposite sides of the sac, and representing respectively the branchial artery and vein. The latter, in C. microcosmus and other As- cidians, bears a longitudinal series of small transverse tentacular filaments. Similar ten- tacles we shall have to describe as belonging to Chelyosoma (fig. 111. i). The angles of the meshes of the branchial tissue bear papillae, more or less prominent, in some genera (Ascidia, Chelyosoma, &c.) ; but in others they are not papillated (Cynthia, &c.). These papillae, or minute pouches, are, according to Savigny, analogous to the fila- ments that border the branchial vein, in most of the simple and compound Ascidians, indi- cating the junction of the transverse vessels with that vein. The appearance of the reticu- lation is large and coarse in Cynthia, minute in Ascidia, and indistinct in Cystingia. Each mesh of this respiratory network is thickly fringed with vibratile cilia, as in the rest of the Tunicates and Acephalans; and Van Beneden points out that this ciliated ex- terior of the branchial vessels is analogous to the ciliated tentacles of the Bryozoa. By the * Roy. Danish Transact, vol. is. pi. 1. fig. 6 & 7.TUNICATA. 1203 4 h 2 action of the cilia the currents are sent in the direction of the oesophageal aperture. In Ascidia papillosa and Cynthia microcosmns, a little soft tubercle is situated on the interior of the branchial sac, not far from the orifice, between the two branchial vehis, not observed in other Ascidians, but seen in all the Botryl- lians. On the internal surface of the sac are also seen several prominent lines, 12-15 in A. mammillaris and A. papillaris, 5-6 in C. am- pulla, more or less distant from one another according to their length. These are folds forming gutters converging towards the mouth, and having also transverse channels leading from one to another. Above they appear to terminate in culs-de-sac. The vibratile cilia covering them are very long and numerous. Van Beneden found that, on placing for a short time a living Ascidian in water coloured with carmine, the particles of the colouring matter quickly filled these little ducts, making them appear like injected vessels. This dis- tinguished naturalist considered them to be somehow connected with the digestive appa- ratus, moulding, perhaps, the particles of food into cord-like masses before entering the stomach. In C'hc/yosoma fj?g.777. i) there is a remark- ing. 777. Anatomy of Chelyosoma Ilacleayanum. (After Eschrickt.")

They appear to surmount a longitudinal vessel or duct, pos- sibly the branchial vein ; they are about 23 in number, and have a transverse direction towards the left side. The posterior tenta- cles are the largest, of about a similar size to the tentacles of the branchial orifice; the others, towards the anterior extremity of the row, become gradually smaller. Their use is not very evident ; possibly they are connected with the organs of digestion ; but, more pro- bably, they are auxiliary respiratory organs, like the circlet of tentacles within the branchial tube. The respiratory cavity, in addition to its external or oral orifice and its oesopha- geal aperture, presents also, in some cases at least, a lateral opening, first noticed by Cams*, and since by Van Beneden. The presence of this communication allows the water, received into the branchial sac for respiration and the conveyance of food, to pass directly out by the anal aperture. Other- wise, when no such communication exists, the water must be ejected through the oral aperture by muscular contraction, as in the Acephala. In ClavellinidcB and Botryllidte the open meshes of the respiratory network-)-, or bran- chial stigmata, also allow of the free passage of water from the respiratory cavity to the cloaca. In Pyrosoma, Pelonaia, and Sulpa, the disposition of parts admits of the free pas- sage for the water from the one external orifice to the other. Externally the branchial membrane presents very similar appearances to its net-like interior surface : where folded, however, of course the folds and sulci are reversed. It is attached more or less firmly to the inner surface of the mantle on the one side, and on the other to the intestines, stomach, and ovaries, by transverse, short, delicate, perhaps vascular, threads, one of which proceeds from each angle of the meshes. " In the young Ascidian," says Cams, " the respiratory sac can be distinctly recognised as an integral part of the intestinal canal. As the body increases, this originally crop-like dilatation gradually attains a more consider- able extent, and differs in structure from the intestinal canal in having exceedingly delicate and transparent parietes ; in a word, diverg- ing more and more from the intestine." We may further observe, that the vertical vessels entering into the composition of the framework of this branchiferous pharyngeal sac, and representing, according to Van Bene- den, the tentacula of the Bryozoa, are not only analogous to the latter in their respira- tory function, but are subservient also to the purposes of alimentation, like the tentacles * Meckel's Archiv f.

Coste (Comptes Rendus, vol. xiv. p. 182. 1844) denies the existence of open stigmata.1204 TUNICATA. referred to, by producing, and being traversed by, the ciliary currents that bring the food to the oesophageal aperture; and that the ten- tacula of Bri/ozoa are essentially members of the alimentary apparatus is shown by the fact, that animalcules, &c. are frequently caught and detained by the action of the tentacles, one or more of which, and sometimes even the whole, bend suddenly inwards, and secure such particles as come within their reach, thus taking the character of prehensile labial or oral appendages.* The cavity of the branchial sac is often the habitation of parasitical Entomostraca. The buccal or branchial orifice of the Asci- dians terminates, as we have already noticed, by a valvular opening in the large delicate membranous sac, which in some respects ap- pears to be a kind of crop, and in others a respiratory cavity. Opposite to it, and in the lower part of this cavity, is the commence- ment of the oesophagus (Jig. 778. d), which leads to the stomach and thence to the in- testine. The viscera are always more or less Fig. 778. Anatomy of Dendrodoa glandaria, magnified alout 3 times.

Hancock, on the Anatomy of the Fresh- water Bryozoa, Annals and Mag. Nat. History, 2d series, vol. v. p. 176. See also Lister and Farre, loc. cit. The mouth, or oesophageal orifice, is at the base of the branchial sac ; so that when the latter extends to the bottom of the cavity of the mantle, the mouth is also at the base of the mantle. When the branchial sac stops short at the middle of the muscular sac, or when it is bent upon itself, the mouth also is near the middle. In the species that have an oblong, transverse cavity, the mouth is at the postero-inferior angle of the branchial sac. The mouth is either a simple round hole or a slit, or it is an aperture divided up by slight folds or ridges. It is always destitute of lips4 H 3 or tentacles, unless we except the peculiar longitudinal row of tentacles passing forward from the oesophageal aperture along the wall of the branchial sac in Clielyosoma and other genera. The oesophagus, sometimes obsolete, is always very short, and is more or less pli- cated longitudinally. The stomach is simple, generally merely a slight dilatation of the alimentary tube {figs. 777. j, and 778. e). In A. mammillata it is strongly plicated, and the pyloric extremity narrowed by little fleshy papillae. It is some- times bent upon the intestine and adherent to it, and is often enveloped in the liver, with which it is intimately adherent. Its walls are very unequal, internally forming various la- cunae, through which the bile penetrates, as in the Bivalves ; the little bile-ducts are guarded with valvules. In Boltenia reniformis the sto- mach is destitute of any internal folioles or lacunae ; but in Ascidia intestinalis, Cynthia pajnllata, C. canopus, and others, internal plicae are present; and in C. ampulla the sto- mach is almost filled up with longish folioles, and is of a light yellow colour from numerous yellowish granules contained in its tissue. In Dcndrodoa the stomach is striated ex- ternally (fig. 778. e). In Cystiugia it is very- large, extending almost the whole length of the body, and bears externally a deep longi- tudinal depression, and is marked internally with faint transverse striae. In Cynthia poly- carpa and C. pomaria, a little ccecum occurs just anterior to the pylorus. The intestine is usually short, simple, and without cceca. In several species of Ascidia its internal surface is traversed throughout nearly its whole length by a semicylindrical, hollow, ridgelike plication, the " intestinal rib" of Savigny, having the appearance of an inva- ginated intestine. In its course, the intestine generally makes one or two folds. Its walls are thickened frequently by a glandular tissue, probably supplying some fluid necessary to digestion ; and its internal surface sometimes bears biliary lacunae. The rectum leaving the peritoneum floats unattached, and opens oppo- site to the second or anal orifice of the mantle, so that the excrements falling into the cloacal cavity are carried away by the current of water leaving the body. In the stomach and intestines is usually found a mass of finely divided matter, chiefly, if not wholly, derived from diatomaceous plants. Towards the posterior extremity of the intestines the ex- crements are usually moulded into little earthy-looking filaments, as in most of the Molluscs. The faeces appear to be formed into these vermiform cords in the sulcus along the side of the longitudinal intestinal fold. In A. mammillata the duodenum has several slight transverse striae. In Cynthia ampulla the intestinal walls are internally hollowed into lacunae and little folds, which, like the coats of the stomach, pour out a yellowish fluid like bile. In Dendrodoa the intestine is of con- siderable length. In Boltenia reniformis also the intestine is long, mounting up as high as the base of the pedicle, then descending nearly ]ATA. 1205 parallel with itself and terminating in an as- cending conical rectum, the anus having a scalloped margin. In this species there are twelve subcubical bodies, separate from each other, adherent to the upper and inner surface of the rectum, having the free edge of a part of the ovary between them and the liver. In size they differ among themselves, the largest lying towards the anus, and the smallest in the opposite direction; they have no apparent communication either with the intestines, with each other, or externally. Under the micro- scope their structure appears to consist of a very fine homogeneous colourless membrane, enclosing an infinite number of excessively minute nucleated cells, readily separable from the tissue, which have much the appearance of blood globules. In Clielyosoma the digestive apparatus is large, and, from the shape of the animal, is arranged flatwise. The oesophagus commences at the posterior left corner of the branchial sac, between the two chambers of the heart. Advancing obliquely forwards, it enters the stomach, around which are clus- tered the biliary cceca. The intestine goes on to make a single bend, and, coming back to the left posterior corner, proceeds towards, and terminates abruptly at a very short dis- tance from, the anal orifice. The liver of the Ascidiadce generally occurs in a very degraded form ; it is either absent, as in Ascidia, Dendrodoa, and some Cynthia', or its place is supplied by lacunae and folioles on the inner coats of the intestinal canal, oc- curring, in Cynthia ampidla, both in the sto- mach and duodenum ; or, on the other hand, it is more or less amply developed, as in Bol- tenia, where it appears as an irregularly lobu- lated body, coating the stomach externally behind the right ovary, and passing from the lower extremity of the body, half-way up, in the cavity of the mantle. The lobes differ in size: the largest are placed towards the pyloric or highest end of the stomach, and are more distinctly separated from each other than the smaller ones ; they are more or less rounded and granulated, their surface being minutely papiliated and composed of minute round bodies, at first sight resembling ova. In Cyn- thia the liver is greenish, granulated, foliated, or, as in C. Dione, caniculate. It is sometimes formed of clustered groups of flask-shaped cellular bodies, the individual cells being fixed by their larger ends, and having a radiate ar- rangement. It is intimately adherent to the external surface of the stomach, which fre- quently is totally enveloped by it. The bile enters the stomach by distinct holes at the bottom of the cavities of the little lacunae before-mentioned. In viicroeosmus, and others, the liver is divided into masses, one of which is situated on the left of the bran- chial sac and quite free of the abdomen. The liver in Ascidia intestinalis has the appearance of somewhat salient glandular bodies, situated as well on part of the intestine as on the sto- mach. In Clielyosoma this organ is represented by a cluster of short coecal tubes lying all over the external surface of the stomach. The1206 TUNICATA. liver cells mBoItenia are elongated coeca, thick, and sometimes deeply divided at the outer extremity, attached by their thin ends, and arranged in eccentrically radiated groups, en- closed in an epithelial membrane, the whole having externally a racemiform appearance. The digestive organs of the Tunicata are subject to congenital malposition ; of which M. Savigny has described two remarkable exam- ples, \n Cynthia Momus and Phallusia Turcica; and Mr. MacLeay was inclined to regard as a malformation a peculiar arrangement of the intestinal canal that was presented by the unique specimen of Cystingia Griffithm de- scribed by him. In a unique specimen of P. Turcica, examined by M. Savigny, the intestine lay to the left instead of the right of the bran- chial sac, and was found bending backwards and embracing the stomach from below, in- stead of bending forwards at some distance from the pylorus, approaching the superior border of the stomach, and then terminating in the rectum. In a specimen of C. Momus, the alimentary canal was also found on the left-hand side ; but, by a very peculiar intro- version, the pharynx was placed at the pos- terior instead of the anterior extremity of the branchial sac. The intestine descended as far as the bottom of the mantle, folded it- self forward, and ascending parallel to itself, terminated opposite to the pharynx ; so that the anus and the oesophageal aperture both opened into the branchial orifice. The ex- ternal communication through the anal orifice existed as usual. Both of these malformed individuals had their ovaries full of egis, but were not, apparently, in strong health, and were more than usually infested with ento- mostraca. In the catalogue of the Hunterian Museum (vol. i. pi. 5. fig. 2.), a dissection of an Ascidian is figured after a drawing by John Hunter (the original specimen, however, has not been found), in which there is, apparently, an abnormal elongation of the oviduct, which is accompanied by a slight granular line, both lying on a large tapering tube having much the appearance of intestine ; the anus, how- ever, shows itself projecting from the side of this tubular body some way lower down, in its usual place. The oviduct, and, apparently, the accompanying elongated tube, terminate externally at a minute aperture placed in the sulcus between the two projecting terminal orifices of the test. The oviduct, however, barely reaches this aperture ; and its accom- panying granular line terminates still lower down. Organs of circulation. — In the Asculiadce there are two large vessels or sinuses, the dorsal and ventral, to which the branchial capillaries, on the one hand, and the heart and peri-intestinal cavity, on the other, are intermediate. The circulation is of the mixed or reptilian type ; both sinuses being in con- nection with systemic and respiratory capil- laries, and the blood, consequently, being sent by one impulse both to the system and to the branchiae, and ultimately returning from both by the same channel. We are prevented from calling either of these sinuses arterial or venous, on account of the periodic reversal of the circulation, mentioned incidentally above, and more fully detailed hereafter, whereby they are alternately changed from vein to artery and from artery to vein. One of the branchial trunks, terminating at the heart, however, answers to the branchial veins of the Gastero- pods and Bivalves ; the opposite, and often double, trunk may therefore be looked upon as the branchial artery, and is connected with the veins of the body. The Ascidia, like the rest of the Acephala, has but a left or aortic ventricle, and no ventricle at the union of the vena cava and the pulmonary artery. This aortic heart or ventricle is not always easy to be seen. When the branchial sac is simply oblong, it is situated towards its base ; and consequently, when the branchial sac is as long as the body, it is situated towards the base of the mantle; and when the sac is shorter than the body, it is placed near the centre of the mantle. When the branchial sac is bent upon itself, the heart is situated at the curve, and then it is always near the middle of the body. In general its position, according to Cuvier, appears to be deter- mined rather by that of the mouth, than that of the rectum; but M. Milne-Edwards and Van Beneden consider that it follows in its displacement the organs of generation rather than the mouth. The heart in the Tunicata is never traversed by the rectum, as in other Acephala. In the Ascidians the form of the heart is oblong, and thin at the two ends, or more or less tubular. Its substance is contractile, but extremely thin and transparent, so that it is scarcely distinguishable in the cavity of its highly pellucid pericardium. Cuvier ob- served that, in the species in which the branchial sac is bent upwards, he was not able clearly to discern a dilatation sufficiently marked to deserve the name of a heart, and was inclined to think that possibly in this case the heart's function was performed by the artery. Here, however, we may notice that specimens preserved in spirit generally afford but very indistinct traces of this organ ; and Cuvier does not appear to have had the opportunity of studying transparent specimens of the living animal, in which the heart can be detected by its pulsating movements. In Ascidia intestinalis the heart, which is very long, and extended under the ventral border of the respiratory sac, communicates with the great thoracic sinus by a longitudinal slit situated at a little distance from its an- terior extremity ; and when the peristaltic movements of the heart advance from behind forwards nearly all the blood contained in its cavity passes into this sinus, penetrating the vascular network of the branchial sac, and passing into the dorsal sinus, whence it is spread amongst the viscera, and returns to the posterior extremity of the heart not far from the anus. During this time the heart consequently performs the functions of a branchial ventricle, and the great thoracicTUNICATA. 1207 sinus is a kind of pulmonary artery. But when this state of things has lasted some minutes, the direction of the peristaltic move- ment of the heart is inverted, and the blood, instead of traversing the branchial network from below upwards as previously, moves from above downwards, and passes from the great thoracic sinus into the heart. The latter is then an aortic ventricle, and the sinus a branchial vein or aortic auricle. In a very fresh and uninjured individual, of Cynthia am- pulla, Van Beneden counted 45 contractions in one direction; and then, after a rest during the space of two pulsations, he counted ICO to 170 in the other, the pulsations being about 70 per minute. In injecting the vascular system of the simple Ascidians, M. Delle Chiaje thought he found certain valvules so disposed as to hinder the return of the blood from the aorta into the cavity of the heart, or from passing again from the heart into the vessels through which it had arrived there. But by careful observa- tions on living specimens, both Milne Edwards and Van Beneden have established the fact, that, as in the Botrylitdce, the Salpidee, and the other Ascidian families, the blood of the Ascidiadce, after having flowed for some time in one direction, traverses the same circle in an opposite direction; a condition that would he impossible were any valvular hindrances to return currents of the blood present. In Chelyosoma*, the heart is very distinctly seen in the animal when dissected ; it lies near the oesophagus, and has two distinct chambers. The aorta rising from its anterior part is a stoutish vessel, and at first lies close to the in- testine : it afterwards runs in the space within the intestinal loop, ultimately breaking up into largish branches, distributed on every side. The ramifications divide some 4 or 5 times, and terminate somewhat abruptly, the extre- mities appearing as if closed. Throughout the surrounding generative organs there is a very fine network of vessels, but whether they are arteries, veins, or gland-ducts is un- decided. A largish vessel running along the left side of the stomach and duodenum ap- pears to return the blood to the branchial sac. Mr. MacLeay describes the heart of Cys- tingia as being large, ovoidal, and of a lobular appearance ; and having four vertical, lateral openings, capable of considerable dilatation. In Cynthia ampulla the heart is placed a little within the great intestinal loop, and near the middle of the body : it is fixed on an oblong vesicle, enclosing calcareous concre- tions. This vesicle is situated exterior to and above the first or principal bend of the intestine. Its colour is a greenish yellow, and it has apparently no aperture, or commu- nication with other organs. The heart itself is a slightly bent tube, with very elastic walls : it has two openings; a single large aperture on one part, and opposite to it three ves- * Described by Eschricht (Royal Danish Trans, vol. ix. p. 12.), to whom we are indebted for much valuable information, both with respect to this genus and the Salpians. sels that carry off' the blood in different di- rections.* " The circulation of the Ascidians," says Van Beneden, " differs but little from that of the Bryozoa; and is transitional between that of the Polypes and of the Molluscs. If we re- move the heart of the Ascidian, the disposi- tion of parts is very similar, and the simpli- fication of an apparatus cannot more visibly take place. The Ascidia is but a digestive canal suspended in the midst of external mem- branes, with a liquid moving in the peri- intestinal space. A colourless liquid (blood) occupies this cavity ; but it is only in the branchial network and tentacles that it can be said to be contained in vessels. All around the intestinal tube this fluid is alter- nately moved from right to left, and vice versa. In the vessels composing the vascular net- work, and in the respiratory tentacles, the same movement of the nutrient fluid takes place. This blood contains somewhat regular globules, white as the containing liquid, that indicate the course of the fluid. In some in- dividuals the blood is yellowish. M. Milne- Edwards has observed an Ascidia with red blood."f Mr. Lister observed that in a sessile Ascidian half an inch long, the blood-globules were about the same size as those of the minute Perophora, viz. from "00025 to "0002 inch in diameter. Van Beneden, to whom we are indebted for so much information with regard to simple Ascidians in general and Cynthia ampulla in particular, has observed in living specimens of this species, that the blood is distributed to each branchial trunk at the same time, and with the same direction, ascending and de- scending alternately. According to this, the heart, contracting in one direction, sends blood towards the branching, filling all the vessels at one time, and recalls it by contract- ing in an opposite direction. That a series of contractions in one direction, during a certain time, may take place without engorgement, there must be a direct communication between the branchiae and the peri-intestinal cavity; and this is afforded, according to Van Beneden, by the respiratory tentacles, see p. 1202. Seen under the microscope, the contractile tissue of the heart affords no trace of mus- cular fibre. The contractility remains some time after the removal of this organ from the body ; and that without being irritated. Nervous system. — A single ganglion, oval, soft, consisting of a saclike neurilemma, enclos- ing nerve-cells or neurine, placed in the sub- stance of the mantle, and between its two tubu- lar orifices, gives off'four branches, two of the branches forming a loop around either tube, and other lesser filaments distributed about * In the Physiological Series of the Hunterian Museum there is a highly illustrative dissection of kC. tuherculata (No. 898" B.), prepared by Prof. Owen, that beautifully exhibits the heart and its pericardium, the branchial vessels, partially in- jected, and other organs. j- Recherch.es Zoologiques faites pendant un Voyage en Sicile.

Cuvier considered the large ganglion to be the analogue of the " inferior " ganglion of Molluscs, found in the Bivalves between the branchiae and towards the origin of the tube that admits the water; and ob- served that he had not seen any nerves ter- minating at a brain, nor the brain itself, which must be situated by the mouth at the base of the branchiae. The great nerve-ganglion in Chelyosoma, long and \"' broad, cylindrical, and yellow- coloured, lies near the middle of the inferior surface of the plated test, and a little to the left (Jig. 777. f). From its anterior angle it sends four branches, two of which form a half- circle around the star-shaped muscular ap- paratus of the branchial orifice, the other two losing themselves in the muscles bordering the nearest plates. From the posterior angle arise eight nerves, four going to the anal orifice, and four to the lateral muscles of the plates (fig. TH.d,g). Special senses. — In the last-named genus there are two remarkable bodies found in connection with the nerve-ganglion, which Professor Eschricht, to whom we are indebted for a careful anatomical description of Che- lyosoma, considers probably to appertain to the function of hearing (fig. 777. g, h). One of these bodies has the appearance of a minute bladder, filled with a whitish substance. It measures V" long, and \"' broad, and lies to the left of, and quite close to, the ganglion, being at its posterior extremity strongly ad- herent to it, or to the base of one of the nerves proceeding from it, by means of a stalk-like attachment. Through its diaphanous walls a row of arched transverse striae are discernible, which are either folds of the parietes, or a par- tition. The other body is pear-shaped, about long, lying anterior to the ganglion and the little bladder-like body, and, like them, be- tween the serous membrane and the respira- tory sac ; its stem is placed between these two bodies, and its head advances up to the hindmost muscle of the branchial orifice. It seems to be of tolerably firm consistence, but it is not at all bony or horny. Its thick, an- terior portion is barely \'" broad, and has anteriorly a deep hole, which seems to lead into a large cavity ; the border on all sides of this pit is prominent, gently declining to a blackish little body within. The Ascidia have frequently around the ex- tremity of each process of the mantle, i.e. the branchial and anal tubes, a row of coloured points or ocelli, similar to the imperfect organs of sight present in the majority of the bivalve Acephalans, where they are arranged along the margin of the mantle, or dotting the edges of the siphonal orifices. The number of these oculiform points correspond with the number of processes or folds that the margins of the tubes respectively bear ; about eight in the * Schalk, De Ascidiarum Structura, Halle, 1814. branchial, and six in the anal tube. They are usually red, as in A. vitrea, A. virginea, A. pru- num, and others; in A. menlula they are yellow, with a central red spot. M. Milne-Edwards has observed similar eye- like points around the oral tubes of Amaurou- rium and Parascidia, belonging to the botryl- lian group of Tunicates. Some of the Salpce also have ocular spots. Besides these oculiform points in the adult animals, Van Beneden has observed in the larvae of Cynthia ampulla, on the side of the gibbous or anterior portion representing the head, some black points that he regards as true eyes. Speaking of the development of the young Ascidian in the egg, Van Beneden describes the separation of the contents of the incubated ovum into an external layer, to form the skin and the tail of the young animal, and a second layer, of which subsequently the walls of the alimentary canal are formed ; and, thirdly, an internal vitelline mass. " In the thickness of the external layer," says Van Beneden, " there appears towards the middle of the body, and rather inferiorly, a cell filled with black pigment, which must be regarded as the organ of vision. It persists during the whole term of the animal's locomotive exist- ence, and disappears after it becomes fixed. These organs," he adds, " which we may well call eyes, although so simple, are constant; sometimes two are discernible on one side." M. Milne-Edwards has also seen in the larvae of the compound Ascidians one or two blackish points, but towards the posterior extremity of the body ; he merely notices them, without assigning for them any function. " We consider ourselves," says Van Beneden, " sufficiently authorised, by all that we have seen in the embryos of the free inferior ani- mals, to elevate these pigment-cells to the dignity of an organ of special sense. To say that the presence of an eye implies that of an optic nerve and of a brain does not appear to us to be more just than to say that there are muscles when there is movement. We have the example of the Hydree, that, without mus- cles, without nerves, without brain, and with- out a special organ of feeling, are sensible to light, and avoid or approach at will bodies whereby they are affected. And if the Hydra, without special apparatus, is sensible to light, we do not see why a cell of pigment may not be the first rudiment of the organ of sight. The appearance of the eye and the ear, in the animal series, takes place in similarly simple rudimentary forms."* Generation. — The Ascidiadce are all herma- phrodites. Between the fold of the intestine, and close to the liver, when the latter exists, there is observed a whitish glandular organ; this is the ovary. An undulatory duct passes from it, which, following the rectum, opens near its extremity into the cloaca. Opposite to the opening of the oviduct, Carus noticed the orifice of another glandular organ, which he thought to be either a male organ, or serving * Van Beneden, Mem. Brux. Acad. vol. xx. p. 40.1200 TUNICATA. to furnish the gelatinous covering of the ova. The ova of Ascidice, instead of passing from the ovary to the branchiae, there to be deve- loped as in a uterus, are emitted externally, by the oviduct conveying them into the cloacal cavity, whence they are carried outwardly by the current of water through the external anal aperture, or through the communicating lateral opening into the branchial sac, and thence through the branchial aperture. Cuvier says that he found some minute egg-like bodies between the branchial sac and the mantle; a position very analogous to that held by the ova of the bivalve Molluscs; and he thought it probable that ova so placed were fecundated by seminal fluid emitted by the same duct that leads from the ovary. These granules, however, M. Savigny appa- rently regards as little glands. The generative organs are sometimes single and sometimes double; in the latter case, the two halves, right and left, are completely se- parate, as in other Acephalans, and emit their products separately into the cloaca, which serves as a kind of incubational or marsupial pouch. The ovary is single in Phallusia, Pandocia, and Dendrodoa; it is usually double in liol- tenia, &c. In Cynthia the ovary is either single or multiple, sometimes very large, form- ing long groups of clustered globules, each globule being crowded with ova. The single ovary is sometimes enclosed within the intestinal loop, without adhering to it, and sometimes, as in C. papillata, &c, it lies against, and is adherent to, the rectum. In C. papiVala the ovary is bent on itself and terminates by an oviduct at each end. In C. canopies there are 2—4> or more ovaries ; those on the right side are placed against the rectum, and all terminate, as usual, by oviducts. In C. microcosmus there are two ovaries on the left side. They are composed of separate gelatinous lobes, having the appearance of a bunch of grapes. In C. myti/igcra the ovary has the form of a membranous pouch, which furnishes points of attachment to the exterior of the branchial sac, and is fixed to the mantle and to the inner part of the intestinal loop. Its duct is very thin, and follows the usual course by the side of the rectum. In C. polycarpa and C. pomaria, Savigny describes certain numerous hemispherical or conical bodies adhering to the mantle, almost fifty in number, and disposed in rows, somewhat cor- responding to the six branchial folds, as being possibly the ovaries of these species. These bodies are without ducts ; they are formed of a mass of granules resembling the eggs of some other Ascidians ; they are much com- pressed, and resemble a compound berry held in a 5-fid cup; they have apparently no com- munication with each other or externally, and are accompanied at their base with gelatinous, transparent, subpedunculated vesicles, appa- rently empty. In C.papillata, which has other generative organs, there are many rows of isolated, gelatinous, semitransparent, wrinkled vesicles, corresponding to the arrangement of the branchial folds, attached to the mantle, and receiving bloodvessels from it. The lobes of the ovary in C. microcosmus, after the emis- sion of the eggs, wither into wrinkled vesicles closely resembling these sessile vesicles in C. papillata. Certain soft bodies observed in C. microcosmus, and somewhat similar to the above, Cuvier regarded as fat, serving as stores of nutritive matter ; but with this Savigny cannot agree. Savigny also points out the occurrence of various irregular, but somewhat similar fungous or fleshy excrescences on the mantle {Jig. 39. i,l, Vol. I. p. 112.), ovaries, and intestines, sometimes even quite investing the latter; but these are quite distinct from the ovary-like bodies above described. In Boltenia reniformis the ovaries are double, unequal in size, elongate, formed of coarse subcubical lobes, situated one on each side of the body, and directed towards the anal orifice; the right or smaller ovary, straight, claviform, fitting closely into the ascending loop formed by the stomach and intestine. The left ovary, larger and less lobulated, is on the opposite side, between the mantle and the branchial sac; it is undulating, and extends downwards behind the branchial vein. The tissue of these ovaries is a yellowish membrane of distinctly cellular structure, containing groups of large opaque ova and smaller clusters of exceedingly minute diapha- nous granules. The ovaries of Cystingia are two free racemes composed of globular bodies, as in Cynthice, arranged on the two sides of the body with the branchial sac and stomach between them. In Dendrodoa (Jig. 778. /e) the ovary is single and branched, consisting of a trifurcate, cylindrical stem, bearing at its base on one side a forked branch, and on the other a simple one, all of the same thickness ; it is situated on the left side of the body between the mantle and the branchial sac. In Chelyosoma, Professor Eschricht de- scribes as an ovary two darkish bodies, filled with vascular ramifications ; placed, one be- tween the liver and the rectum, and the other around the fold of the intestine. Another somewhat similar organ, traversed by rami- fying vessels, and placed at the anterior ex- tremity of the body, is apparently the testicle. Connected with this organ, a distinct sigmoid duct runs to the right posterior angle of the body, from whence a filamentous tube passes along to the left posterior corner.* In Cynthia ampulla the generative organs are situated in the intestinal fold, and appear at first sight to form a single organ ; but by the aid of the mi- croscope two distinct organs, male and female, are easily recognised (/g.779. a). The testicle forms a sort of framework around the ovary ; it is of a milky white colour, and is composed of an infinite number of short, twisted coeca, visible to the naked eye, and somewhat ana- logous to the seminiferous canals composing the testicles of higher animals. Three or four mammillary processes rise from the anterior * Royal Danish Transact, vol. ix. p. 13.1210 TUNICATA. surface of this organ : they are hollow in the centre, and emit a milky fluid, which is shed Fig. 779.

The ovary is blackish, and is situated in the midst of the testicle. Its situation corresponds to that of the ovary of the Limaees among the Gasteropods, which is surrounded by the liver. It is easily distinguished from the testicle by its colour and by the appearance of its contained eggs. The oviduct opens into the cloaca by the side of the anus. In Ascidia grossularia the eggs, seen through the walls of the ovary, are of a fine red colour, and are contained in separate sacs, the ovary appearing like a bunch of grapes {fig. 779. b). Van Beneden has distinctly seen in all of these ova the two germinal vesi- cles. The vitellus is at first white, but during development it becomes of a deep red. By the side of the ovary is another series of sacs without ova, and some free cells containing a great number of other more minute cells moving about in their interior, and which when shed swarm about like spermatozoa. These appear to constitute the male organ, and its disposition accords with that of the Amaroucium argus, and with that of the Bryozoa (Van Beneden). There remains much to be elucidated with regard to the generative functions of the Asci- dians. The male and female organs are always associated together, and are apparently each provided with efferent ducts. It appears, however, doubtful whether or not occasion- ally the ova and the spermatozoa may not be brought into contact either in the organs them- selves or in the ducts, as well as in the cloaca. We may notice that the disposition of the sexual organs in the Bryozoa, to which in so many respects the Tunicata bear reference, appears to be, from Van Beneden's observa- tions, as follows. A male and a female organ are separately developed in the peri-intestinal cavity. Each is formed of cells, and in these cells are formed others, which become either vitellus or spermatozoa. When the latter cells are matured, the walls of the ex- terior or mother-cells are burst, and their con- tents are shed into the fluid filling the cavity around the intestine. It is here the male and female elements come into contact, and the ova are subsequently discharged by an orifice at the side of the anus. In some compound Ascidians the peduncle- like post-abdomen forms a receptacle for the ova; and so does the pedicle of Clavel- lina, as in Cirrhipeds ; but the pedicle of Boltcnia and similar forms does not appear to be used for that purpose. Muscular system. — The Ascidiadce being fixed in their adult state, have no muscles of general locomotion ; but they have numerous muscular bands by which they can effect cer- tain movements of contraction and extension. The muscles do not consist, as in Bryozoa, of isolated fibres folding themselves irregularly during contraction ; but each muscle is com- posed of many fibres united. They make their appearance in the young individuals contem- poraneously with the appearance of the respi- ratory sac. The muscular fibre of Tunicata, like that of the whole of the Acephala, is of the organic or unstriped type. In the Ascidiadce, as in other Tunicates, the muscular tissue is chiefly developed in the mantle ; the muscles of the heart and in- tesinal canal (if present) have not been observed. The muscles of the mantle are very thin and narrow bands, generally at considerable distances from one another, sur- rounding all the body of the animal from the anterior to the posterior extremity, and uniting in part with one another on the median line of the dorsal walls {fig. 780.). Fig. 780. Muscular sac or mantle o f Boltenia reniformis. {Original.) In Ascidiec the mantle is more muscular on the anterior and largest part, and more membranous posteriorly. Externally there is a layer of longitudinal muscular bands, and internally of transverse bands. In someTUNICATA. 1211 (A. intesti?ialis,&c.) the exterior layer is much the thickest, and is composed of about twelve distinct fascicles, the fibres of which are somewhat separated from one another, insensi- bly disappearing on the anterior and superior borders. In others (Cynthia microcosmus, &c.), this external layer is very slight, and formed of distinct fibres, whilst the internal fibres are stronger, transversely oblique, and interlacing. Circular bands of muscles generally surround the tube of each orifice, and are rather stronger towards its base. The fibres forming these collars of the two tubes occasionally in- terlace with each other at the interval between the tubes, in a figure-of-eight pattern. Some- times these muscular collars or sphincters are very indistinct, and not so apparent as another set of fascicles, which run in a diagonally transverse direction across the sac, and pass up the sides of the tubes, converging at the orifices. The latter bands diverge from the two orifices in two sets, which in part cross each other obliquely, and form an open net- work. In Chelyosoma (fg.777.a,b) each of the six triangular valvules that surround either orifice is furnished with a fan-shaped set of muscular fibres, adhering at one end to the inner sur- face of the test, and at the other extremity to a small papillary process on the valvule. Be- sides this set of muscles, and within them, is another set which passes laterally from one papilla to another, forming a sphincter, the base of which is hexagonal. There are other strong subcutaneous muscular fibres passing from the edge of the upper part of the tunic to that of the lower, and also from the edge of each of the coriaceous plates forming the upper surface (c, c). By the action of these muscles, the body or inner sac of the animal is transversely con- tracted and somewhat lengthened; the tubular processes also of the mantle are closed, and more or less retracted. When the animal is alarmed, the contraction takes place rapidly, causing the water contained in the respiratory and cloacal cavities to be ejected by one or other of the orifices to the height of even three feet. There is considerable analogy between the muscular system of the Aseidice and that of the Bryozoa. In the latter there are retractor muscles of the sheath and the intestinal tube ; and in the interior of the cells there exist also transverse oblique cords, traversing the peri- intestinal cavity, and attached to one or the other surface of the skin. These transverse muscles contribute to open the tentacular circlet; and in the Ascidkc,by their contraction, produce the jet that escapes from each of the two apertures. Embryo-genesis of the Simple Ascidians.—In examining under the microscope a portion of the ovary of a recent Ascidia, eggs in all stages of development may often be observed. In describing the various conditions and modifi- cations of the ova of this family in course of development, we shall borrow largely from the careful and extensive researches given to the world by Professor Van Beneden, to whom naturalists are so deeply indebted for much valuable information on the subject of the em- bryo-genesis of many of the Polypifera* and other groups of animals. The earliest form of the ovum is a simple vesicle; it next appears as a vesicle with an inner vesicle, which is evidently "the vesicle of Purkinje;" and, thirdly, with a second, still smaller vesicle, " the vesicle of Wagner ;" these latter vesicles, one within the other, being enveloped in the outer or vitelline membrane (fig. 781. a). The space between the external membrane and Purkinje's vesicle is occupied by a sub- stance, at first clear and probably fluid, but soon appearing granulated, constituting the vitellus. This yolk increases rapidly, soon oc- cupying the whole ovum : at the periphery its granules or cells become organised (Jig. 781. b), uniting among themselves, and forming a continuous sacciform membrane. The mode of growth of the vitellus is by new cells being formed in the interior of the large older cells, and subsequently producing others in their own interior. The growth of the whole ovum is evidently carried on by this process. The whole surface of the vitellus soon after- wards becomes embossed, presenting a mul- berry-like appearance (Jig. 781. c). The ger- minal vesicles disappear. At the centre of each little mammilla of the surface a trans- parent vesicle becomes distinctly visible, and the whole appear like so many ova each with the vesicle of Purkinje. These mammillas in- crease, and their peripheral substance rapidly becomes granulated, in a similar manner to the change that took place in the whole vi- tellus. The mammillated appearance is now soon lost from the growth of the grannies, and the surface becomes uniform, the mam- millas of the periphery uniting into a mem- brane, which constitutes the blastoderm. Ac- cording to Milne-Edwards, the blastoderm in the BotrylUdcexa formed at a determinate point only; but in Cynthia ampulla (the species in which Van Beneden watched the modifica- tions of the ovum) the latter observer feels assured that it is formed simultaneously all over the yolk, as in all the inferior animals. At this period a number of vesicles become somewhat regularly arranged over the exterior of the ovum, which by their union with one another form a new enveloping membrane. Beneath this membrane a space, occupied by fluid, soon becomes apparent. All over the exterior of this new membrane are distributed white, transparent vesicles, having much the appearance of oil globules. This envelope soon becomes more and more extended by the increase of the contained albuminous fluid, and a second membrane appears beneath it on the surface of which also oil-like globules become apparent, as on the external mem- brane (Jig. 781. d). The ovum is now com- posed of an external membrane, of a white * See Polypifeka ; also Papers by Prof. Van Beneden on Campanularia, Tubularia, and Bryozoa Me'm. Brux. Acad. torn. xvii. xviii. and xix. '1212 TUNICATA. fluid layer, another thin transparent membrane, an organised layer forming the periphery of the vitellus, and lastly of the soft yolk in the centre, the vitelline membrane and the blas- toderm forming one with the vitelline mass. The external membrane and the albuminous layer beneath it appear to be formed exter- nally to the ovum by the oviduct or the ovary; and as they envelop the ovum after its com- plete development, they may be considered only as accessory parts. It being uncertain whether the ova in which these changes take place, have been subjected to fecundation whilst still in the ovary or ovi- duct, there arises the interesting question as to what extent of modification, even to the disappearance of Purkinje's vesicle, and the mulberry-like condition of the vitellus, can take place before the ovum has received the stimulus of the seminal element. During the changes of the ovum in this first period of its development, the colour of the egg is occasionally subject to certain modifica- tions. In Ascidia grossularia, the ova become of a bright red colour, and in some species no change of colour takes place. In Amaroucitim, a compound Ascidian, the ova change from a pale to a deep yellow. The second period of development is marked by the prolongation of one side of the yolk to form the caudal appendage. The ovum has now a chorion, albumen, and yolk, the two latter being separated by a fine membrane. The vitelline or embryonic mass becomes con- tracted about its middle, and is somewhat bean-shaped. From this time there are ob- servable two extremities, one lengthening it- self, as the other becomes more and more globular; and respectively representing the caudal appendage and the body (Jig. 781. e).

The former of these becomes more and more elongated, following the outline of, and fold- ing itself around, the body, which is included in the ovum, as in many reptiles. In Amaivucium, according to Milne-Ed- wards' observations, the tail is formed by the marginal portion of the yolk being condensed, at the same time that the body is flattened, and then separated from it throughout its length. Van Beneden, however, remarks, that in the simple Ascidians, as we have stated above, the tail is rather an elongation of one part of the yolk, and that, like the exterior organs of all other animals, it is formed by extension and not by division or separation. The body part of the embryo has an in- ternal cavity, and is formed of the yolk; it is surrounded by the membrane, which becomes the skin of the body and tail. The caudal appendage is hollow, and communicates with the central cavity ; it does not in Ascidics pre- sent the spiral or zigzag cavity observed in the RotryllidcE. There is soon formed within the embryo another layer distinct from the exterior, and which is destined to become the parietes of the intestinal tube. There exist then two layers, internal and external, from which all the organs are derived. In the thickness of the external layer, near the middle of the body, and rather superiorly, occurs a black pigment- cell, which Van Beneden regards as a rudi- mentary eye. In Amaroucium, Milne-Edwards has observed one or two blackish oculiform points towards the posterior extremity of the body. The chorion is now ruptured, and the larval embryo appears with a pellucid membrane covering its body and tail (fig. 781. f). This membrane has been already mentioned as in- vesting the ovum at a late stage of the first period of its development, immediately after121.3 TUNICATA. the vitellus lost its mulberry aspect, and when the albumen was formed. It closely envelopes the caudal appendage, and termi- nates beyond it by a tapering prolongation : subsequently it becomes the test of the ani- mal. The larva, resembling in appearance a frog-tadpole, still remains a while in the cloacal pouch, but is soon carried out by the current leaving the animal : it is very active, wriggling about for hours. After a brisk locomotive existence for about twelve hours, the embryo fixes itself to a foreign body. The tail then begins to disappear, being slowly absorbed; its pellucid membrane remains entire for a little time, but is ultimately detached from the body. At the same time other appendages spring from the body, the principal one of which arises from the an- terior extremity, elongates itself more and more, attains a trumpet-like shape, and may be considered as the future mouth (fig. 781. g). In Amaroucium, i\Jilne-Edwards ob- served generally five appendages arising from the anterior extremity of the body, two of which soon disappear, and the three others, which are persistent for a while, terminate in button-shaped, dilated suckers, touching the parietes of the external integument. In Cynthia ampulla other processes or appendages occur all over the body ; these are somewhat similar to the anterior appendage, but are never constant, either in direction or number; one specimen had seven appendages on one side. Sometimes the numerous appendages resemble tentacles, giving the embryos the appearance of young Tubulariae. These processes are hollow, communicating with the central cavity. None of them appear to open externally, or to be at all like suckers; and a considerable space frequently exists between them and the enveloping membrane. The young animals are attached to solid bodies by this external tunic, on a different side to that at which the orifices make their appearance. " If," says Van Beneden, " the appendages served as suckers for attachment, the animals would have the mouth on the side by which they are attached." It is at this stage of growth that the walls of the internal cavity are distinctly seen through the external membranes. The contents of the digestive tube are seen th consist of a rather opaque mass, distinct from the surrounding clear space. As soon as the animal is fixed, the trans- parent membrane that has remained floating since the absorption of the caudal appendage, is completely detached, and the integument and the test begin to be formed. In the third period of development the embryo takes on the ascidian character. The development of the internal organs progresses, and the external orifices become apparent 0%- 781. h). At the commencement of this period, the form of the young Ascidian varies considerably. The numerous appendages dis- appear, just as the caudal appendage was lost. The embryo becomes rounded and larger, and its substance is distinctly seen to be disposed in three layers. Up to the present time the vitelline cavity has had no external communi- cation, but the mucous cavity is now extended on one side, to form the mouth. The mucous layer is elongated also on the opposite side, but instead of reaching the exterior, it is folded back on itself, forming the intestinal loop. The yolk soon opens a passage on each side, constituting the oral or branchial, and the ventral or anal, orifices. The intestinal tube becomes completed by its separation into the respiratory, the digestive, and the cloacal cavities. Around each external orifice certain nipple-like, palpiform bodies appear, which soon lengthen, but before long they are hidden by the integument (Jig. 781. <). The eye like pigmentary spot still continues for some little time, and is situated in the middle of a band (the oesophageal collar) that seems to embrace the respiratory cavity. At the base of the intestinal cavity, the opaque concretionary body appears, to which the heart is subsequently attached, and which Van Beneden considers to be analogous to the internal shell of the Limaces. This is furnished with vibratile cilia, which occasion circulatory currents, until the heart makes its appearance in the form of a thin, gently pulsating, mem- branous body. Contemporaneously with these cilia, others appear in the interior of the bran- chial sac, in the form of a ciliated; circlet, to which a second and afterwards others are added, forming altogether the peculiar bran- chial tissue. These cilia give rise to currents in the digestive and subcutaneous cavities. The young Ascidian can now carry on the functions of respiration and digestion. At the surface of the skin, and around the anal and branchial cavities there are apparent longitudinal stria?, which are evidently the rudi- mentary muscular bands. The sphincters, also, at the two extremities of the intestinal tube, are brought into action. Some slight further modifications only are now required to perfect the development of the little Ascidia. Anatomy of Clavellinid.e.— ClavelUna, — At the superior extremity is the buccal orifice, which is circular, looking directly upwards (fig. 768. c), and furnished with a very thin, prominent, cylindrical margin ; to the interior of which is attached a ring or circlet of simple tentacular filaments, about thirty in number, of which about ten are long enough to reach to the centre of the cavity of the tube, whilst the others are very short, and situated between the first. Near this first orifice, and toward the supe- rior part of the dorsal aspect of the thorax, is the second or anal orifice, which is also cir- cular, with an entire rim. The external tunic or tegumentary membrane (test) of the body is thin, but subcartilaginous. It adheres feebly to the other parts, except around the two orifices. At its base, or inferior extre- mity, there are a variable number of radici- form prolongations, which serve to fix the animal, and some of which often bear at in- tervals little pyriform tubercles, which be- come developed into new individuals.TUNICATA. 121 The test is so transparent and colourless, that the interior structure of the animal may be easily studied without having recourse to dissection. There is observable, however, certain yellowish lines traversing the transpa- rent test, which have a granular appearance, and correspond, according to M. Milne-Ed- wards, to the lines of junction of certain parts of the interior. Two of these bands descend vertically, very near one another, throughout the medial line of the ventral surface of the thorax, and are separated by a linear, colour- less, semi-opaque space. A third line rises on the right and left of the test, at the superior part of the thorax, and is directed horizon- tally backwards, describing a circle around the base of the oral orifice. A fourth line, also annular, encircles the inferior extremity of the thorax. A fifth surrounds the anal ori- fice, and is prolonged upwards and forwards, almost to the posterior margin of the oral orifice. There is generally a sixth line, much paler than the others, and more deeply situ- ated, at some distance from the dorsal surface of the thorax, descending vertically from the superior to the inferior ring. Towards the middle of the abdominal por- tion of the body the stomach appears, as a small, orange-yellow, oval mass, bearing four yellow vertical lines, like those of the tho- rax. Lastly, close to the stomach, is another orange-coloured spot, formed by a coloured portion of the intestine, and, still lower, the whitish gland-like mass, comprising the gene- rative organs (fig. 768. p). The mantle is suspended within the first tunic ; it is membranous and extremely deli- cate. Superiorly it is attached around the two orifices, and inferiority it terminates in a cul-de-sac. It often presents inferiorly some tu- bular prolongations, sometimes simple, some- times ramified ; which descend towards the base of the animal, and sometimes project into the interior of the root-like processes of the external tunic. Its surface is traversed with divers muscular fibres, some of which arel circular, and constitute the sphincters around the mouth and anus ; whilst others, to the number of nine or ten pairs, arise from a kind of tendinous collar surrounding the mouth, and descend vertically to the inferior extremity of the abdomen. These last muscles serve to shorten or bend the body, and it would appear that it is by the elasticity of the external tunic that they are lengthened again, after having been so contracted, for there do not appear to be any traces of transverse muscular fibres proper to act as antagonists to the vertical fibres. In all the thoracic portion of the body a third tunic is present. This, like the pre- ceding, is membranous, and is suspended in a kind of sac formed by the latter ; it adheres to it by the rim of the anal orifice and along the collar around the base of the mouth. Inferiorly this membranous pouch is united in its extent to the two orifices of the diges- tive canal, where for the most part it is con- tinuous with the wall of that tube. Its cavity constitutes the thoracic chamber. It encloses the branchial organs, and presents on the dorsal side a free space, which forms a kind of cloaca, ending at the anal orifice of the ex- ternal tunic. Along the medio-ventral line a vertical groove is observable, and at the point where it adheres to the second tunic, between the mouth and the anus, we can perceive a minute tubercle, which is the nervous gan- glion. This thoracic chamber exactly re- sembles the great cavity of the Salpians, and would scarcely differ at all, if the cloaca were shorter, and the anal orifice more distant from the mouth, and directed backwards. The branchiae {fig. 768. e) exist as a large membranous band, arising from the dorsal sur- face of the thoracic cavity, below the gangliform tubercle, and by its opposite extremity fixed to the space situated between the oesophageal ori- fice and the termination of the intestine, thus separating the cloacal from the great pharyn- geal or respiratory cavity ; only, in place of presenting on each side simple stria; furnished with vibratile cilia, as in the Salpians, this kind of vertical body bears right and left a series of filiform appendages, directed hori- zontally towards the ventral side of the respi- ratory cavity, where they are fixed on each side of the middle sulcus, and, during their passage across, are united together by a number of other slender vertical filaments. From this disposition of the parts there results a kind of trellis-work, which fills up all the pharyngeal portion of the branchial chamber, permitting no communication between the latter and the cloaca, except through the meshes of its net- work, which are bordered all around with vibratile cilia. This complicated branchial apparatus adheres also to the thoracic tunic by its two extremities. The dorsal column, which thus forms the base of the branchial organ, and which represents the simple bran- chia of the Salpians, is considerably prominent in the interior of the respiratory cavity, and exhibits along its ventral margin a series of ten membranous languets, which are usually straight, and are apparently susceptible of a kind of erection. The interior of this mem- branous band is occupied by a large vascular cavity, which M. Milne Edwards terms the branchial or dorsal sinus. The transverse little fillets which spring therefrom are in number about twelve pairs, and the vertical filaments that unite the latter are nearty of the same size: these are about thirty in a rank, and there are thirteen ranks, viz. eleven situated between the two transverse fillets, and two which stretch from the first and second fillets to the wall of the thoracic chamber, and are fixed along the two yellow lines, placed as rings at the two extremities of that chamber. Some membranous processes appear also to stretch from different points of the surface of the branchial net-work to the walls of the cavity in which the latter is suspended ; but these are few, and do not hinder the eggs, deposited in the cloaca, from insinuating themselves frequently into that portion of the cavity situated on each side of the respiratory1215 TUNICATA. sac. The spaces circumscribed by the narrow elongated meshes, supported by the vertical filaments, and bordered with vibratile cilia, are not occupied by a membrane, but form openings, somewhat like a button-hole, called branchial stigmata. These chinks or spiracles, through which the water passes from the branchial sac in the thoracic chamber to es- cape outwards by the anal orifice, are conse- quently disposed in the same manner as the vertical filaments that circumscribe them, that is, parallel to each other and in transverse ranks, thirteen in number. Lastly, each of these vertical filarrfents is perforated by a canal, opening by its two extremities in other similar but larger canals, that occupy the in- terior of the transverse fillets. The latter vessels in their turn empty themselves by one of their extremities into the great dorsal or branchial sinus, and by the opposite extremity into the vertical fold of the ventral wall of the thoracic chambers, which is circumscribed by two parallel, vertical, yellow lines, and which places the respiratory organs in relation with the great thoracic sinus, lying between this chamber anil the ventral portion of the internal tunic of the body. These two sinuses communicate also one with another by the vessels that surround the branchial orifice, and from which spring other vessels that de- scend towards the abdomen. The pharyngeal portion of the thoracic chamber, tapestried with the branchial net- work, opens externally at its upper extremity, by the branchial aperture, which occupies nearly the whole of its diameter, and is furnished with a kind of radiating net-work of tentacular filaments. This cavity is cylindrical, and at its inferior extremity has a large trans- verse slit, the opening of the oesophagus, oppo- site to the external oral aperture. The oeso- phagus is large, and descends vertically into the abdomen terminating in the stomach (fig. 768.I), which is ovoid and swollen. The intestine (to) springs from the inferior extremity of the stomach, and at first running vertically down- wards, and then bending forwards and upwards, so as to form a loop, it ascends towards the thorax by the side of the stomach and oesophagus, slightly covering them on the right side. Arrived at the superior part of the abdomen, it is again bent, passes by the side of the oesophagus, ascends rather behind the branchial sac, and terminates at the inferior part of the cloaca («), at about the level of the antepenultimate row of the branchial stigmata. Throughout its length the intestine preserves nearly an equal calibre, but varies in its ap- pearance, and is divisible into three portions. The first part, the duodenum, succeeding to the stomach and forming the intestinal loop, is colourless and transparent. The next por- tion, placed on a level with the stomach, but on the ventral side of the body, is on the contrary of a dull-yellow colour, and the tissue of its walls has a glandular appearance. This M. Milne-Edwards considers to be the hepatic portion of the alimentary canal, and comparable to the organ known in insects as the chylific ventricle. Lastly, in its third portion, the intestine again becomes mem- branous and colourless : here the faecal matter is collected into brownish pellets, and from its functions and position this portion of the tube is termed the great intestine, or rectum. To the right of the intestinal loop is placed a glandular mass, the chief part of which is formed by the ovary, recognised by its vesicles, and by the eggs of different degrees of development contained in it. Below the ovary is the testicle, a mass of whitish and ramifying fila- ments, spread out in some degree on the intestine. From this glandular mass arises a milk-white filiform canal, which ascends be- tween the stomach and the intestine, passes on the left side of the oesophagus, and opens into the cloaca, near the orifice of the rectum. This canal contains a silvery white fluid, crowded with spermatozoa, and must be con- sidered as a vas deferens. There being no other visible duct leading from the ovary, this canal perhaps serves also as an oviduct. The eggs are minute, circular, and of agreenish yellow colour. The heart is situated at the inferior part of the abdomen, lying against the intestine and the ovary, to the right and in front of the former, at the posterior part of the cavity of the mantle, between the tunic and the intestine, and much resembles that of Ascidia intestinalis. It is enclosed in a membranous sac or pericardium, and is cylindrical in form ; its superior extremity is on a level with the centre of the stomach, and its lower ex- tremity, turned up a little behind, passes some- times a little beyond the intestinal loop. The Perophora, first described by M. Lister in Phil. Transact. 1834, p. 378., as a " small Ascidia," is parasitic on Confervse, &c, and appears to the eye like minute lumps of pellucid jelly, with a spot of orange and grey. The group consists of several individuals, each having its own circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems, but fixed on a pedicle that branches from a common creeping stem, and all are connected by a circulation that extends throughout. They are very trans- parent, and their interior is easily seen. The two orifices are very short tubes ; the bran- chial is at the summit, and the anal is a little lower down. The longest diameter from the peduncle to the space between the openings is about '085 inch (see fig. 306. a and B, p. 623. Vol. I. Cilici). The test is subcartilaginous and tough, more pliable near the orifices. It is lined internally with the soft mantle, in which a ramifying circulation is very distinct. A great part of the interior is occupied by the branchial sac, which is subcylindrical, flattened at the sides, and has its axis vertical. It is united to the mantle above and behind ; the juncture, beginning in front of the oral open- ing, extends backwards on each side of it, and then downwards in two lines ; between these, along the middle of the back, is a vertical compound stripe. At the bottom, the branchial sac appears to be in contact with the mantle, but at its sides and front a vacant space is left between them, communicating1216 TUNICATA. with the anal orifice (see fig. 306. B,f, loc. cit.). The sac is more compressed towards its lower part ; and here are placed, externally to it, the heart on the left, and the stomach and the other viscera on the right side, the anus opening upwards into the cloaca. On its sides and front the sac is perforated by four rows of narrow, vertical, irregularly oval holes or spiracles, about sixteen in each row, placed at less than the diameter of one of them apart from each other. Through these the water, which flows constantly in at the mouth when its orifice is open, is apparently conveyed to the vacant space between the sac and the mantle, and it then escapes by the anal orifice. The branchial tissue is extremely thin between the stigmata, but their edges are thickened, and are lined with closely set cilia, which by their motion cause the current of water. When these are in full activity, the effect upon the eye is that of delicately toothed, oval wheels, revolving continually in a direction ascending on the right and descending on the left of each oval, as viewed from without ; but the cilia themselves are very much closer than the apparent teeth, and the illusion seems to be caused by a fanning motion made by them in regular and quick succession, producing the appearance of waves, and each wave an- swering to the apparent tooth. The spaces between the rows of spiracles are of much more substance than the intervals between the spiracles in a row ; filamentous processes are stretched from them across the side cavi- ties, attaching the branchial sac to the mantle : these spaces also support finger-like processes, about eight in a row, that project nearly at right angles into the central cavity. The large short tubes of the branchial and anal orifices have each five or six obscure marginal indentations, and can be drawn in and closed at the will of the animal. Within and at the bottom of the branchial tube are nu- merous, simple, tentacular filaments of different lengths. The particles drawn into the bran- chial sac by the current of water are seldom stopped by these tentacles, but lodge some- where on the branchial net-work. A lively animalcule will sometimes disengage himself by struggling, and dart about in the cavity until he lodges on some other part; or if a morsel is found unsuitable, it is ejected by the funnel's being closed, and the branchial sac suddenly contracted vertically. Mostly, however, whatever part the food lodges on, it travels from thence horizontally with a steady slow course towards the front of the cavity, where it reaches a downward stream of similar materials ; and they proceed to- gether, receiving accessions from both sides, and enter at last, at the bottom, the oesopha- gus; which is a small flattened tube, carrying them, without any effort of swallowing, towards the stomach : the oesophagus takes a sharp curve upwards and backwards before arriving there. " It is extraordinary," observes Mr. Lis- ter, " that the particles pass along so near to the spiracles, with their cilia in full activity, with- out being at all affected by them." " I have, says he, " in some positions, seemed to catch a glimpse of a membrane suspended within, too transparent to be commonly seen. One may imagine the water to pass to the spiracles strained through the meshes of such a mem- brane, and the food to be carried along it by invisible villi; but this is mere conjecture." The stomach runs backward horizontally. When seen from the side, its anterior portion has an inflated appearance, and, when from below, it seems to possess two lateral lobes. The liver has an ochreous tint, and envelopes the anterior portion of the stomach. The in- testine on leaving the stomach rises, and then bends forward with a sigmoid flexure, and ter- minates in an ascending rectum and sphincter. Transparent vessels ramify along a part of the intestine, and meet at a collection of globular bodies, from whence, in one indivi- dual, two flatfish lobes were observed to extend backwards. These globular and lobate bodies probably constitute the generative organs. From the meeting of the above-mentioned vessels two branches run ; one downwards and backwards, but under the stomach, the other forwards. From their direction Mr. Lis- ter supposed them to communicate with a main stream of blood near the heart. The circulation in these animals is very interesting, and easily discerned through their transparent tissues. The blood circulating in one individual of the group descends by the peduncle into the common root-like stem, and penetrates into the next member of the group, so that there exists in these Ascidians a com- mon circulation, having as many centres and motive organs as there are animals growing on the same stem. The blood-globules are very numerous, and though not uniform in size or shape, are mostly between '00025 and •0002 inch in diameter, and approaching to globular. They are easily measured, as in the intervals between the stigmata they pass mostly but one at a time. The creeping tube, which unites the individuals of a group, contains two channels for two separate currents of blood, an upward and a downward one, that are flowing at the same time, and that send off" each a branch to every peduncle. The blood then passes into the animal by one current, while another carries it back. One of these canals communicates, at the termination of the peduncle, with the heart, which is placed, as before mentioned, near the bottom of the branchial sac on the left side, and consists of a transparent ventricle or tube, running for- ward and a little downward, in a channel hollowed to contain it. Along the whole length of this tube, a part on one side of its axis seems fixed to the channel, the rest is free and contractile. Mr. Lister observed that when the blood entered the heart from the peduncle, contraction began at the middle of the ventricle, impelling onward the contents of the forepart ; and the contraction of the back part followed in the same direction, so as for the whole to have the effect of one pulsation. The heart was then filled again by a flow from the peduncle. The intervalsTUNICATA. 1217 of the pulse were pretty regular in the same individual; but in different ones they varied from two seconds to one and a half second. Part of the blood thus impelled formed a main upward stream along the front of the branchial organ, branching oft* at each of the horizontal passages between the rows of spiracles, and traversing the space above them on a line with the junction of the branchial sac and the mantle on each side. All these streams again united, and formed a downward current behind. The horizontal vessels were connected also by the smaller vertical channels between the spiracles ; the set of the current in the latter being up- wards for the two lower rows, and downwards for the two upper rows. Another large portion of the blood, on leaving the heart, immediately divided into many ramifications, that spread like a net-work over the stomach and intestines, and over the mantle. Of these, a part ran into the hori- zontal passages above the branchial sac, a part into the descending dorsal vessel. A large proportion, after leaving the intestines, took a short course, and collecting into one channel, flowed into the dorsal vessel near the bottom, and all, united, then entered the peduncle, and constituted the returning current that went to circulate in other animals of the group. After this circulation had gone on for a while, the pulsations became fainter for a few beats, and the flow slower, and suddenly, with but slight pause, the whole current was reversed, the heart gave the opposite impulse. The vessel in the peduncle that before poured in the blood, now carried it back, and the other channel the contrary, and every artery became a vein. These changes continued to succeed each other alternately. The average time of the currents being the same in both directions, but the period of each varying within a single observation as much as from thirty seconds to two minutes. Mr. Lister points out the ana- logy between this phenomenon and the very similar circulation that obtains in the stem of the Sertularia, described by him in the same volume of the Philosophical Transactions. This acute observer goes on to say, that some- times, when the creeping tube, or the peduncle, has been injured, the circulation of an indi- vidual is in consequence insulated, but without appearing to impair any of its functions. In one animal which was severed from the pe- duncle, the pulsation ceased for a few seconds. It then began irregularly, and with consider- able pauses, increasing in steadiness as it went on. At first the impulse given by the heart was towards the front ; and the downward back stream, instead of flowing out at the wound, was poured into the hinder end of the ventricle ; the cut end of the vessel leading from the heart being nearly opposed to the bleeding dorsal vessel cut through at the same place, and the two vessels, in their undisturbed state, lying across each other at this point. But when the current was reversed, part of the blood was driven for a time through the stump of the peduncle into the water; how- ever, it soon staunched, and all the vital VOL. IV. actions went on as before the separation, ex- cept that at the beginning of every pulsation there was a slight recoil. In one case, where the circulation did not extend to another animal, one channel only was observed to be open in the peduncle, and in this a small current ran to and fro accord- ing to the direction of the impulse given by the heart. Some animals, which had probably been injured, but were still connected with other vigorous ones, seemed to be in course of absorption. One was observed in which the soft parts were so shrunk as to occupy a small part only of the tunic. The currents of its peduncle extended into this mass, but no heart or motion of branchiae was visible. Upon looking at the same the next day, the tunic was empty, the soft matter and the cir- culation reaching only to the end of the pe- duncle. Mr. Lister also once noticed a flux and reflux of the blood in a creeping stem, where the current did not communicate with any animal. In the buds sprouting from the stem, and destined to become new animals, the two streams of the stem run through the germ before its organs are developed. The generation of the Clavellinidce takes place in two ways—by ova and by buds. The genesis of the larva? of Clavellina from the ova is very similar to that of the larval Ascidice. The young of Perophora have not yet been observed. The method of the gemmiparous reproduction, according to the observations of Milne-Edwards, is as follows : Amongst the radiciform processes springing from the base of the test of Clavellina, and tending to preserve the animal in its position, are other filamentous prolongations which are hollow, and enclose a membranous tube, continuous with the internal tunic of the animal, and through which the circulation seen in the in- terior of the abdomen is also continued. This stolon-like body is closed at the free extrem- ity ; it is at first simple, but as it lengthens, it becomes ramified ; and when its growth is further advanced, there are developed on the extremities of its branches, and even at dif- ferent points along its length, tubercles, en- closing in their interior a minute organic mass connected with the interior tube. These tubercles rise vertically, and become elongate and claviform. The blood that circulates in the stem at first penetrates into the soft, pear- shaped, pedunculated mass occupying each of the tubercles ; but after a while these little germ-masses lose their peduncle and their at- tachment to the internal tunic of the principal canal, and participate no more in the circula- tion of the mother-animal. By further de- velopment they soon put on the ascidian character. The branchial sac is perfectly dis- tinct, although not yet communicating with the exterior ; and the digestive tube bent loop-wise, below the thorax, is plainly discern- ible. Lastly, the oral orifice appears, and the general form of the young animal approaches more and more that of the adult. From this a new individual is then in like manner pro- duced by stolon and bud, remaining attached 4 i1218 TUNICATA. to the mother by the former, and which at first has a circulation in common with the older animal, but soon enjoys an independent existence. The individuals either remain at- tached by the intermediate root-like prolonga- tions, or become separate by the disunion of these slender filaments. In one species of Clavellina, the bud-like bodies and young animals are produced not only on the root-like stolons, but also on the walls of the test itself {fig. 768. u, u'). In Perophora the growth of the buds is con- fined to the extremity of the creeping, root- like tube, and the attachment of the indi- viduals by the common root-stem is perma- nent through life, and not merely existent during the young state. Anatomy of the Botryllid^:.— A de- scription of the form and structure of the test of these compound Ascidians has been already given. The in- and out-lets of the aggregated individuals, as we have already seen, have either separate external openings, or the several vents of a " system " of animals unite to form one large common cloaca and external anal orifice. All these external orifices are more or less irritable and contractile. When the little animals dilate their branchial orifice, a part of their body is raised so as to slightly emboss the general surface of the mass, and they pro- trude a membranous circlet or ring, the free border of which is cut into, generally six, regu- lar lobes, but sometimes into eight. In Poly- cliniim, the mouth is very contractile, and is surrounded by six little digitiform processes. Parascidia has eight of these tentaculiform bodies. Frequently, after death, as in Lepto- clinum, these orifices contract, and their bor- ders sink in so as to be discerned with diffi- culty. In the interior of this orifice, and towards the base of the collar, a series of minute tentacular filaments can be perceived by the aid of a lens, which are directed, like the spokes of a wheel, towards the centre of the opening, or have a more or less curled ap- pearance, in a similar manner to the tentacles occupying the same position in the simple Ascidians and in the ClavellinidcB. The ten- tacles vary from four to twelve or more, but nine or ten is their usual number; they differ materially in length, some being nearly ru- dimentary, whilst others, alternating with the first, are long enough to meet across the open- ing. In Amaroucium Nordmanni there are six long and six short tentacles within the bran- chial tube. In Botryllus smaragdus, in which the buccal orifice admits of considerable dila- tation, a circlet of four longish filiform ten- tacles may be seen. The tentacles in B. aureus are more numerous than usual, but both in this species and'in B. violaceus they are almost rudimentary. Diazona has fifteen or sixteen simple tentacles, and in SigiUina there are twelve. Around the base of the denticulated rim of the branchial orifice in Amaroucium argus (fig. 782.) there are seen four minute pinkish spots, which are probably rudimentary organs of sight. Similar, but more numerous, pigment- spots are observed in Leptoclinum Listeri, Pa- rascidia, and other genera. Fig. 782. Anatomy of Amaroucium argus. (After MMne- Edicards.)

The separate anal orifices are frequently destitute of the crenulated or denticulated margin that surrounds the branchial tube. This condition has afforded a distinguishing character for some of the minor groups in Milne Edwards' classification of the Bo- tryUidce. In Polyclinum, Amaroucium, Bo- tryllus, and other genera, the anus, instead of opening directly outwards, empties itself into a common cloacal cavity, that belongs to a number of individuals, and is in the form of a large canal hollowed out of the common tegumentary mass. This is frequently rami- fied interiorly, as in Botrylloides, and termi- nates at the opposite extremity by a simpleTUNICATA. 1219 excretory orifice, not occupying the centre of the " system," but placed nearly at one of the extremities, and communicating with the in- dividuals situated at the other end of the group by means of the interior canal. In Amaroucium the faecal or anal orifices, by which the common cloacae open externally, are wide open during life, and easily per- ceived ; their form is round and their border thick; but after death they contract, and are so much sunk in that they are demonstrated with difficulty. The anal orifice in some genera is sur- mounted by a membranous languet, either simple or trifid (fig. 783. i'). Fig. 783. Anatomy of Botrylhides rotifera.

In pointing out the natural groups of the associated Ascidians we have spoken of the division of the body into distinct portions, as the thorax, and super- and post-abdomen in Amaroucium (fig. 782.), and in PolycUnum, where they correspond to the three vertical chambers of the animal's cell; and into the thorax and abdomen in Didemnum. The latter arrangement resembles that of the C/a- vcUincE; but in the Botryllians, on the other hand, no distinct separation is observable, the viscera being pushed up by the side of the branchial sac, as in the Perophorce and the simple Ascidians (fig. 783.). The thorax is generally more or less cylindrical, sometimes hemispherical (fig. 769.) or subglobose, and contains the branchial organs. In Botryllus violaceas there are two little glandular tuber- cles, one on the right and one on the left of the buccal orifice, and situated at a nearly equal distance from the superior extremity of the ventral sinus and the dorsal nucleus or nerve-ganglion. The branchial sac of the Boiryllida: is very similar to that of the ClavellirMce. The bran- chial spiracles, or intervascular spaces, are variable in number, and the crest or fold cor- responding to the anterior border of the branchial sinus has no membranous languet; but in Diazona, Synoicum, and PolycUnum it bears a row of minute tentacular filaments. The branchial sac of Sigillina has 4 large, salient, transverse vessels on each side, united by 15 or 16 smaller longitudinal vessels ; and in Aplidium there are 10 to 12 trans- verse branchial vessels. PolycUnum has 14? transverse branchial vessels anastomosing with 15 to 18 finer longitudinal vessels. In Ama- roucium there are 10 to 12 rows of stigmata, and in PolycUnum 13 rows. Didemnum and Leptoclinum have 5 rows. In Botrylhides the respiratory sac presents 10 vertical rows of spiracles, parcelled into threes by vertical folds. There are 9 of these chink-like open- ings on each lateral rank, and at each of their four angles is a little tubercle. In Botryllus the respiratory sac lies almost horizontally, and has on each side 9 transverse rows of stigmata, grouped into threes by the longi- tudinal folds. The angles of the branchial net-work are marked with papillae in Distoma and Diazona. Instead of papillae on the spaces between the branchial meshes, Leptoclinum Listen has a thin ledge between each row of spiracles; and in front there are three tapering moveable prominences, one connected with each ledge, either stretched forward horizontally into the cavity, or bent downwards with a spiral curve. These laminae, observes Mr. Lister, seemed to suspend a generally invisible vertical mem- brane, and to assist in giving the food its direction towards the stomach ; for it moved horizontally along the sides of the cavity, as in Peropkora, and when it reached the front, took a spiral motion downwards. When the branchial sac of the Leptoclinum contracted forcibly to reject what had been stopped by the tentacles, or found unfit for food, the oral orifice, instead of projecting, was then drawn down below the level of the external test, and depressed it, the cilia being also closely stretched across the openings of the spiracles. When the cilia were thus stopped in their action, they were seen to be very numerous, and being in close contiguity one with another, the neighbours by their sides, and the oppo- sites by their ends, appeared almost as a con- tinuous membrane. The superior abdomen of the Polyclina contains the digestive apparatus, and the post- abdomen the organs of generation and the heart. The intestines of the Botryl/idce are always subject to one or more foldings, and their several portions are frequently distin- guished by different tints of colour. 4 i 2TUNICATA. 12-20 The superior abdomen in Amaroucium is short and rounded, and slightly separated from the thorax. The oesophagus is very short ; the stomach in A. proliferum is marked ex- ternally with a series of vertical folds, the edges of which, seen under the microscope, are furnished with secretory follicles. In A. argus, the exterior of the stomach is coated with a tessellated series of irregularly hexa- gonal, gland-like, bodies, having the appear- ance of a number of minute honeycomb com- partments, around each of which are radiating lamella? or folds. In Sidnyum the stomach is also surrounded with glands; and in this genus the intestine is spirally folded. In Diazona the stomach is striated externally ; its inner surface is provided with numerous salient folioles ; and the pyloric entrance is guarded with an annular fold or valvule. The intestine in its first part is simply membran- ous, but afterwards it is furnished with irre- gularly disposed glands, which have the form of caeca! tubes. The stomach of Sigillina bears some slight ridges on its inner surface, the strongest of which correspond to external furrows. In Aplidium the stomach is some- what oblong and truncate, and is divided by deep plications into three longitudinal cavities, or rather into five, the lateral ones being sub- divided. The intestine is bent sometimes forward and sometimes backward; in the latter case it passes upward obliquely on the right side of the stomach ; the rectum is sometimes spirally arranged, and sometimes straight. In Polychnum also the intestine is spirally folded, obliquely traversing the left side towards the anal orifice. In A. proli- ferum and A. argus the rectum ascends to the middle of the cloaca. The post-abdo- men is elongated, narrow, and tapering, divided from the digestive cavity by a marked constriction. The ovary occupies nearly the whole length of this cavity (fig. 782. p), and is partially surrounded by the glandular mass of the testicle, from which latter an undulatory vas deferens runs upwards to end in the cloaca near the termination of the rectum. The ova are whitish, yellow, or brown, and on escaping from the ovary appear to pass to the cloaca by the vacant space between the intestines and the interior of the mantle. The heart is a tubular vesicle, bent on itself, and situated at the inferior apex of the ovary. In the Didemnians the digestive, generative, and circulatory organs are grouped together in the pedunculated abdomen, and offer no- thing remarkable. The ovary is situated by the side of the intestine, and protrudes down- wards only when full of eggs, which in this case have, when fully developed, a large size, compared with that of the animals. The mantle of the Didemnum, as in many other BotrylUdce, is frequently produced in the ab- dominal region into stolon-like processes, which traverse the common test. These swell at their extremities into reproductive buds, from whence arise new animals. Of these proli- ferous tubes we shall have to speak hereafter. The stomach of Botrylloides rotifera {fig. 783.) is pyriform and divided into seven or eight lobes by furrows that pass horizontally from the car- diac to the pyloric extremity. The intestine is sigmoid, and is divisible into three portions; the first part is smooth and transparent, the second is surrounded with a granular tissue, and the third is membranous like the first. A glandular mass, apparently the hepatic organ, is situated at the commencement of the third portion of the intestine, and gives rise to many minute excretory ducts that soon unite into a single trunk, which appears to empty itself into the intestine near the pylorus. Be- low this organ and more behind, is another glandular mass, which apparently belongs to the generative organs, and gives origin to a little duct passing upwards to the cloaca. The heart is situated laterally, reposing on the cardiac side of the stomach. In B. rubrum the ovary is double, one part being situated on either side of the thoracic chamber. The testicle is seldom very distinct in the Didem- nina and Botryllina, but has been occasionally observed. i The nerve-ganglion between the two orifices, or rather on the dorsal side of the buccal orifice, is generally more or less distinct in the BotrylUdce. The circulation of the BotrylUdce does not materially differ from that of the other Asci- dians, and has the same peculiar periodical change in the direction of the blood-currents. In the Polyclinina the heart is placed quite at the inferior extremity of the post-abdomen. It is invested with a thin, transparent pericar- dium, and has the form of a large contractile tube, bent on itself, and tapering at the ex- tremities. In the Didemnina the heart is shorter, and instead of being situated beneath the ovary, it is lodged with that organ, by the side of the intestinal loop, this condition approaching that existing in the Clavellinidie. Lastly, in the Botryllina, it ascends still higher, being seated near the stomach, nearly at the base of the branchial sac. Milne-Edwards, to whom we are indebted for the preceding facts, remarks that these different positions of the heart always coincide with analogous changes in the position of the ovarium. It is also the same, says he, in the simple Asci- dians ; and Cuvier was, without sufficient reasons, led to consider that the heart fol- lowed in its position that of the mouth. If, says M. Edwards, we separate from the common test of any of the Polyclinian species a lively individual, and place it under the mi- croscope with a little sea-water, the move- ments of the heart may be easily studied. The heart's contractions succeed each other somewhat regularly, but they are not brisk and extending at once through the organ, as in the generality of animals. The contraction commences at one of its extremities, and the narrowing of the tube is propagated in an undulatory manner towards the opposite ex- tremity, in a manner somewhat similar to the peristaltic movements of the intestines in the higher animals. For some time the contrac-1221 TUNICATA. tions follow each other somewhat rapidly, and have all the same direction ; but suddenly they are arrested, and then recommence in a con- trary direction. The blood thus sent sometimes from behind forwards, and sometimes vice versa, ascends towards the thorax ; but does not appear to be conducted thither by vessels. It is poureil out between the inner tunic of the abdomen and the viscera lodged in that cavity ; and here it forms currents, which vary in their position according as the movements of the animal, or any other mechanical causes, op- pose their passage. In general, however, the chief portion of the blood ascends by the dorsal or the ventral surface of the abdomen ; and after having bathed the surface of the viscera, it gains the base of the branchial sac. When the heart's contraction is from behind forward, the ascending current passes along the anterior side of the abdomen, and the blood enters a large vertical canal, on the front of the respiratory cavity, termed by Milne-Edwards the great thoracic or ventral sinus. This median sinus gives rise on each side to a series of large transverse vessels, which intercommunicate by means of a num- ber of minute vertical vessels, and which, after having formed a kind of vascular net- work, spread over the walls of the branchial cavity, and terminate in another vertical canal parallel to the ventral sinus, but situated on the opposite side of the thorax. A portion of the blood arrives at the same time in this dorsal sinus without having traversed the branchial net-work, by means of a vessel that arises from the superior extremity of the great ventral sinus and surrounds the base of the branchial orifice. Lastly the blood spreads out between the viscera and the internal tunic of the body, descends along the dorsal side of the abdomen, and again reaches the heart. If the circulation were constant in the above direction, it would somewhat resemble that of the other Acephalans. The heart might then be compared to an aortic ventricle, the tho- racic sinus to a great branchial artery, and the dorsal sinus to a branchial vein. But owing to the contrary directions of the blood-cur- rents, from the periodically varying impulses of the heart, the vessels that fulfil at one time the functions of veins, at another become arteries, and vice versa. This peculiar extra-vascular circulation, so well described by Milne-Edwards, is also very distinctly seen in the Clavellince. The learned professor especially notices C. jiana as highly illustrative of this phenomenon, the inter- abdominal space being in this case very large, and the currents of the nutritive fluid, with its suspended spherical globules, being easily discernible through the transparent integu- ments. Mr. Bowerbank has favoured me with an account of some observations made by him on the circulation in the common tegumentary mass of Botryllus. Under the microscope, the more transparent portion of the test ex- hibited a reticulated arrangement of sangui- ferous channels or vessels ; perhaps the true " marginal vessels " of Savigny ; each mesh, formed by the anastomosing currents, being occupied by one of the star-like " systems" of animals. No communication could be traced between the circulation and that of the ani- mals themselves ; the former appearing to be analogous to the peculiar stem-circulation of the polypifera, to which also the circulation of the nutrient fluid in the budless stems of Pcrophora, noticed by Mr. Lister, vide supra, has reference. Embryogcncsis of the Hotryllidce.—In the de- velopment of the ova of the compound Asci- dians, there are certain striking differences from the conditions that take place during the em- bryo-genesis of the Ascidiadcc. These, however, are chiefly confined to the composition of the egg, the formation of the Blastoderm, the mode of growth of the caudal appendage, the organs of vision, and the anterior appendages. From the elaborate observations of this family, given by Professor Milne-Edwards in his Paper before referred to *, it appears that the ova of several species of the Polycliuina are, whilst still enclosed in the ovary, and before that their development is much ad- vanced, of an ellipsoid form, and are com- posed of a very thin external membrane, a subgelatinous whitish and granular inner mass, and a minute central vesicle filled with a watery fluid. The internal vesicle is the vesicle of Purkin je, or the proligerous vesicle ; the granular substance surrounding the ve- sicle is the imperfect vitellus, the vitelline membrane being the external envelope. Whilst these ova are still enclosed in the upper part of the post-abdomen, they grow rapidly and become spherical. But the most remarkable change that takes place consists in the colour of the vitellus, which is at first a pale, and afterwards a deep yellow. The vesicle of Purkinje is still visible at the com- mencement of this period of the development, but it soon disappears, and there then appeal s on the surface of the vitellus a nebulose spot of pale yellow, which appears to be the blasto- derm or proligerous layer destined to become the embryo of the young Ascidian. The ova arrive in the cloaca, and sometimes are even lodged in the lateral portions of the thoracic chamber, without having undergone any other appreciable modification. M. Milne- Edwards considers it probable that the fecun- dation of the ova takes place in the interior of this cavity. They are here brought into contact with the spermatozoa, and very shortly after having arrived here, they exhibit evi- dences of active internal changes. The granules composing the vitelline mass become grouped into clusters, forming them- selves, as it were, into balls, and giving the surface an embossed or mulberry-like aspect. At the same time there is formed between the yolk and the external membrane of the ovum, a gelatinous, transparent, and nearly colourless layer, which apparently becomes the external tunic or test of the young animal. * Observations sur les Ascidies composees. 4i 3TUNICATA. 1222 When the ova, lodged in the marsupial pouch or cloaca, have arrived at a rather more advanced period of their development, the vi- tellus loses the mulberry appearance it had but lately put on, and, if compressed between two slips of glass, it is seen to be wholly com- posed of minute globules or granules of dif- ferent sizes. The ovum is soon a little flat- tened, and the yolk appears to be concentrated Fig. towards the middle, forming an ovoid mass of a deep yellow colour, surrounded by a some- what large border of a clearer tint. This mar- ginal portion of the yolk is condensed in its turn, and although at first sight appearing to constitute a sort of ring, becomes a long taper- ing prolongation, which encircles the central part of the yolk, adhering by its base, and having its pointed extremity free (Jig. 784. a). 784.

The caudal elongation of the internal tunic (containing the vitelline matter) has entirely disappeared,' and this tunic (b) has taken the form of an ovoid sac, slightly contracted in the middle; a pale yellow circle (d) at the anterior ex- tremity surrounds a spot that will become the mouth, and posteriorly another, clear, spot (c) appears, in which the heart will be developed.

Individual about 20 days old, magnified (lying with its anterior extremity to the right), a, tegu- mentary envelope; m, faecal matter hi the intestine. In the course of incubation, the ovum in- creases in size, becoming flatter and more oval. The vitelline mass becomes more com- pact, and its surface denser; and the latter seems to be organised into a membrane, dis- tinct from the yolk beneath. The two por- tions of the ovum, before described, become more and more separate; that which occupies the centre of the ovum becomes ovoid, and knotty at one of its extremities; near the other extremity, which is continuous with the mar- ginal portion, are seen one or two blackish minute points. This ring-like portion is now seen to be a caudal prolongation, too short completely to encircle the central part, from which also it is distinctly divided a little in front. Lastly, the whitish substance sur- rounding the vitellus, and constituting the tegumentary mass, increases considerably in thickness. When the ova more nearly approach ma- turity, the tail-part of the vitellus is shortened, and its central part, or body of the embryo, is more and more condensed. Its anterior ex- tremity becomes lobulated and encircled with a series of five cylindrical processes, which have a divergent arrangement, and advance towards the border of the egg. Three of these ap- pendages terminate in a kind of button, and the intervening two are tapering anteriorly.TUNICATA. 1223 4 I 4 At each side of the base of the group of ten- tacles, a little prominent lobular process is present. Lastly, the side of the body, opposite to that on which the tail is placed, becomes somewhat strongly embossed near its pos- terior extremity, and towards the space where the above-mentioned black points occur (Jig. 784. n). The ovum ready for exclusion differs ap- parently little from the foregoing state. The two anterior styliform appendages have almost entirely disappeared, and the three obtuse processes are further developed. The trunk is contracted towards its anterior extremity, and the yolk-mass still further condensed at the centre of the ovum. Theexternal membrane of theovum becomes excessively thin, and then breaks and allows the embryo to escape. Generally this ex- clusion takes place in the interior of the cloaca, but sometimes not until the ova have passed out by the anal orifice. However that may be, the young animal, free from its envelopes, soon extends its tail, and swims in the ambient fluid by the aid of its undulatory movements. In its general form the young Ascidian re- sembles somewhat that of a newly born tad- pole (Jig. 78-1. c); but it still more resembles a Cercaria. The trunk or body of the larval Poly- clinum is oval and rather depressed. The whitish tissue of the future integument occupies all the surface, and is considerably developed at the margins ; its substance is granular and apparently subgelatinous ; its consistence is greatest at the surface; and it does not appear to possess a membranous investment. To- wards the centre of the trunk is a large ellip- tical membranous sac, the internal tunic of Milne-Edwards; this is filled with the yellow substance of the vitellus, and is continuous anteriorly with the three tubes dilated at the end, and terminating at the anterior wall of the egg in a sort of sucker. By means of gentle graduated pressure, some of the yolk may be easily made to pass from the principal sac into these appendages, and vice versa ; the little capsule, also, terminating each of these appendages can be made to protrude exter- nally by the same means. At the base of these three processes the vestiges of the others formerly occupying the intervening spaces may be observed. The yellow substance contained in the internal tunic appears to be separated into two portions; the one is clear, and situated near the wall of this sac, and the other, denser and of a deeper tint, occupies the centre. Pos- teriorly a little marginal space, clearer than the neighbouring parts, is also visible, and on one of the sides the above-mentioned minute black spots are visible. The tail is very large, and, like the trunk, is composed of two distinct parts ; the one superficial, colourless, diapha- nous, gelatinous, and much resembling the al- bumen of the eggs of frogs ; the other, central and yellow. This latter part is continuous anteriorly with the central sac of the trunk, and is also composed of a membranous tunic, enclosing a yellow granular and semi-fluid substance. It sometimes appeared to have a central canal. The larvae, after swimming about with an active wriggling motion for a few hours, attach themselves to the surface of a solid body, and, if disturbed from their position, swim about as before until they meet with a similar situation. Their activity having ceased, they become permanently fixed, and are then about the size of the head of a very small pin. They appear to affix themselves to their rest- ing place by means of one of the little suckers with which their anterior extremity is fur- nished. The larva has now lost all power of loco- motion, and quickly undergoes further changes of form. The anterior extremity of the trunk is widened, and the prolongations of the in- ternal tunic quickly disappear. The central portion of the tail becomes at the same time empty, its contents being returned to the cen- tral yolk-mass of the body. The sac or internal tunic enclosing the yolk becomes much con- tracted and spherical; lastly, the yellow matter, which was unequally divided, seems again to be rearranged. The tail, which during the early period of the existence of the larva per- formed so important a part, being the only instrument of locomotion, is now reduced to its gelatinous or tegumentary portion ; and this, after becoming more and more trans- parent, withers, and finally is detached, or falls away in shreds at a more advanced period of the growth of the animal. The trunk, on the other hand, is the seat of important and active changes. The tegumentary portion of the body is much widened, taking an oval out- line, and is visibly augmented in bulk. The interior tunic continues at first to lessen, and becomes quite spherical, and many large patches of a lighter yellow than the rest are apparent, one of which occupies the anterior, and two others the posterior portions of the tunic (Jig. 784. n). M. Milne-Edwards further remarks, that the modifications already noticed ordinarily occupy the space of from ten to twelve hours ; and if the larvae are again examined towards the end of the first day of their sedentary existence, further changes in the interior tunic may be observed. In a speci- men carefully watched by him, the follow- ing changes were noted. Instead of being spherical, the large yellow sac became oval, and its anterior part much thinned. It soon afterwards again became elongated, and a circular contraction divided it into two por- tions (Jig. 784. e). The anterior portion, smaller and lighter coloured than the pos- terior, was rounded in front, and presented at that part a large annular patch of a deep yel- low, vaguely circumscribing a central paler portion. The posterior part was swollen and of a deeper yellow than the anterior, and quite behind there was observable a minute patch of a very clear yellow. This latter spot sub- sequently became the heart, and the annular spot on the other extremity of the body was developed into the thorax of the animal. The following day all these parts grew still more distinct. The anterior portion of the inter-TUNICATA. 1224 nal tunic or the thorax, which had been smaller than the abdominal or posterior por- tion, was much increased, and far more dia- phanous, and the part occupied by the whitish anterior spot was somewhat elevated in the form of a nipple, marking the future position of the mouth. The obscure circle that sur- rounded the base of the buccal region was now replaced by a very narrow yellow band ; and on the inferior part of this thoracic portion of the body there were observed two yellow lines, vertically dividing it into three nearly equal lobes. The abdominal portion of the internal tunic was, on the contrary, much straitened; the pericardial spot was more dis- tinct; and another less distinctly limited spot, situated more in front, presented apparently the first indication of the stomach. Towards the middle of the second day, the middle lobe of the thorax was much enlarged, and in certain positions of the animal appeared to be formed by a new interior cylindrical sac, which in front united with the anterior wall of the thorax at the point occupied by the yellow ring before described, whilst laterally it was separated from the internal tunic by the spaces corresponding to the lateral lobes already men- tioned. One of these lobes became very much narrowed, and seemed destined to form the great vascular sinus: subsequently, traversing the anterior surface of the thorax, the other lateral lobe appeared to correspond to the future cloaca; and the middle lobe was evi- dently the branchial sac, from the base of which arises the digestive tube. A few hours after, the anterior nipple-like prominence was more salient, and seemed to be contractile. The situation of the stomach and the course of intestine were also distin- guishable in the abdomen {Jig. 784. f). The yellow substance had now in a great degree disappeared, but it was still present in a pretty considerable quantity in the alimentary tube, and appeared to pervade all the interior parts of the young animal. Towards the end of the second day, the bran- chial orifice was easily distinguished at the summit of the thorax, and its margin began to be somewhat crenulated. This orifice, how- ever, was present only in the internal tunic, the tegumentary substance being continued over it without interruption. The nerve-ganglion appeared in the form of a minute tubercle. The yellow line encircling the summit of the thorax appeared as the superior margin of the branchial sac. All the thoracic portion of the body contracted itself from time to time. Lastly, the anal orifice began to be visible. On the third day, the heart was seen to pulsate, and pellets of faacal matter were visi- ble in the intestine. The following day, the mouth opened externally,and the water passed through it to the branchial cavity. About the same time, the integument was perforated also by the anal orifice, from which faecal matter was discharged, provided without doubt by the digestion of nutritive matter furnished by the vitelline mass (Jig. 784. g). On the following days, the growth of the young animal was more rapid, its organs became more distinct, and soon afterwards the spiracles of the branchial sac, disposed in transverse rows, were visible, as well as the vibratile movements of the cilia, with which the stigmata are fringed. The number of these rows, however, was but four, the adult animal having ten. The young Amaroucium was now provided with all its necessary organs except those of generation, of which no trace was yet visible, and the future situation of which was occupied by other organs, the heart being close up to the intestinal tube. The general form of the body resembled more that of a Didemnian than of a Polyclinian, for it had as yet no post- abdomen, and the loop of the intestine was folded up against the inferior extremity of the thorax. Lastly, during the succeeding days, the abdomen very much lengthened itself (Jig. 784. h), and at the end of the second week there was present, between the heart and the intestine, a granular mass, which by its ap- pearance and position could readily be re- cognised as the generative organs. With regard to the development of the integument of this, at first solitary, but sub- sequently compound, Ascidian, and which is evidently the analogue of the polypary of the Polypifera, we have mentioned that at first it is a gelatinous layer, surrounding the yolk. An inner membrane, immediately in- vesting the yolk, and regarded as the blasto- derm, becomes the internal tunic of the animal. Whilst the larva goes through its early changes, there appears no connection at all between the inner tunic and the integu- ment. Indeed, says M. Milne-Edwards, the larva may be seen sometimes to be entirely turned round in the cavity of the tegumentary envelope; and sometimes, when it abandons its original position, it forms a kind of hernia on the exterior of this envelope, by distending it at a weak spot (Jig. 784. g). The learned professor does not, however, regard this en- velope as being either a deposit produced by secretion, or as an organised body that had ceased to live since it had ceased to be attached to the interior parts of the animal; because, as he observes, it continues to grow and gives un- mistakable signs of vitality. Thus, not only does its bulk rapidly increase, but it frequently gives rise, as in Amaroucium Nordmanni, to lobe-like expansions, frequently changing their form, contracting and dilating very gently, and appearing to have some analogy to the proteiform expansions of the Amoebce and other inferior animals. Of these changes Professor Milne-Edwards has given an inte- resting series of figures. It is only when the mouth and the anus open externally, that an attachment is estab- lished between the integument and the inter- nal tunic of the animal; and then, as through- out its future existence, it is around the two orifices only that organic continuity exists be- tween the two parts, one only of which is in direct relation with the organs of animal life. It is consequently probable that the nutrition1225 TUNIC AT A of the test is carried on by imbibition only ; and M. Milne-Edwards points out the fact of the independence of these two portions of the body of these Ascidians during the early periods of their life, as worthy the considera- tion of physiologists ; and he adds, that proba- bly this kind of vitality of the integument of the larval Ascidians has some analogy with •what obtains in Sponges, and may, perhaps, throw some light on the peculiar existence of the basilar portion of the SertularieB and other Polyps, that continue to live for some time after the loss of the soft parts that are generally, but wrongly, regarded as constitut- ing the entire animal. From observations made by the same natu- ralist on the development of the ova and larvae of other species of the Polyclinina, and of the Didemnina and Clavellincc, it appears that very similar modifications take place ; the time occupied in the development being of course variable according to specific and external conditions. The larvae of Clavellina have the internal tunic strongly Iobed in front, very tumid behind, and destitute of the pecu- liar appendages observed in the Polyclirdna. These appendages exist in the Didemnina, but are very short; and at their base are seen a row of pyriform lobules, which might easily be taken for the germs of young individuals, but all of which really belong to one individual. The observations made by MM. Lowig and Kdlliker on the embryogeny of some of these animals are generally in accordance with those of M. Milne-Edwards, but on some points, and especially with regard to the develop- ment of the Botrylli, there exists considerable discordance of opinion. The points involved being not only of interest, but of no slight im- portance, it is necessary to give in detail some of the most important observations recorded by the above-named naturalists. In Botry/lus violaceus, B. aureus, Apli- dium gibbulosum, and Amaroucium Nordmanni, MM. Lowig and Kolliker observed, in the first stages of development, a division of the yolk similar to that taking place in the eggs of frogs, and described also by M. Milne-Ed- wards, and established also in the case of the simple Ascidians by Van Beneden. This divi- sion takes place as in the intestinal worms; that is to say, the simple nuclei, contained in the globules, which, as everywhere, are only aggregations of granules, always become double before the globules are divided in two. As soon as the division has arrived at a certain degree, the spherical form of the mass of glo- bules becomes elongated, and takes more and more the form of an embryo, its tail making a semicircle about its body. The tail is distinct before any other part, and this, according to these observers, is evidently formed, not by an elongation of the embryo, but by the separa- tion of a portion of the globules from the sur- face. In Amaroucium and Aplidium, at the same time as the exterior form of the embryo, and at a very early period, the two ocular points, remarked by Milne-Edwards, make their ap- pearance; presenting as yet no trace of an envelope or of anterior processes. At a later period only is there formed around the em- bryo a transparent, colourless border, which, in Amaroucium and Aplidium, increasing more and more, especially at the thick end of the body, appears as a very strong lamina, but remains without structure all the time the embryos are contained in the membranes of the egg. Cotemporaneously with the forma- tion of the envelopes, the embryos themselves commence also to undergo a series of changes. Firstly, towards the anterior extremity, there appear the three appendages of peculiar form ; secondly, the yellowish substance in the in- terior of the body separates into two lamina?; the one, external, remains diaphanous ; the other, internal, becomes opaque, and divides, in the Botrylli, into eight conical corpuscles, wh'ch surround a somewhat large, round, perforated nipple ; lastly, a great number of structural modifications take place. The mature embryos of B. aureus are formed of a spherical body, 0-28"' broad and 0-38"' long, possessing an orifice surrounded anteriorly with three lobules, and posteriorly bearing a thin, tapering tail, 0'72w long. These em- bryos present exteriorly the thin, transparent, structureless layer (tegumentary layer) before referred to, from which almost solely the lobes, or lanceolate appendages of the head, are formed, and which terminate at the opposite extremity in a prolongation exceeding in length those parts of the tail enclosed within it. In- terior to this, in the anterior part of the body, is a second delicate envelope, formed of cells either round or changed into fibres, which does not enter into the composition of the lobes of the head, but encases the mammil- lated prominence before described, and also the eight spherical bodies surrounding it, and is attached at one end to the edge of the nipple, and at the other to the interior part of the tail. The internal substance, constituting the chief mass of the embryos, is, according to MM. Lowig and Kolliker, evidently a group of individuals, as M. Sars, who discovered those curious embryos of the Botrylli, has already shown. The eight spherical corpuscles, united at their bases, and provided with a kind of common stem, are so many individuals, and the prominent nipple situated in thejr centre represents the common excretory tube. This salient tube at its extremity has three lobules, which project into the base of the lobes of the exterior envelope : from its base three filaments (nerves ?) arise, which passing upwards bifurcate each into two, one of which terminates at the orifice of the tube ; the second reaches the summits of the lo- bules, and, passing beyond them, spread into five or six branches, extending almost to the edge of the lobes of the exterior envelope. In the eight embryos no orifice is perceptible, nor any other organs, except some canals (intestine) indistinctly rolled up. Their mi- croscopic elements, however, are very dis- tinct ; namely, various-sized nucleated cells, filled with pale red granules and fibres in1226 TUNICATA. process of formation ; the former constitutes the principal mass of the excretory tube. The internal part of the tail, which is apparently a direct continuation of the substance of the embryo, possesses an interior cavity, and its walls are composed of two layers of cells. The internal layer is formed of cells of 0-012'" diameter, rectangular, with the angles slightly rounded, distinctly nucleated, and containing fine yellowish granules. They are very regularly arranged side by side in transverse series, so that the cavity of the tail is always surrounded by 10—12 cells. The external layer is composed of a continuous, simple layer, formed of minute cells, measur- ing 0-003"'—0-004."', without any distinct ar- rangement. It is to be observed that this tail, formed simply of cells and a homogeneous envelope, exhibits very active movements, affording a new proof of the contractility of parts composed merely of simple cells. The body of the embryos of Aplidium and Amaroucium is formed (at an early stage) of a thick, homogeneous, external layer, and a yellowish mass enclosed within it. In the spherical portion of the body, this mass is ap- parently wholly composed of round cells, of different sizes, and containing nuclei, and, towards the interior, probably unaltered glo- bules produced by the division of the vitellus. These two elements do not compose any dis- tinct organ ; but only form two layers, one internal and opaque, and the other external and diaphanous. In Amaroucium Nordmanni there is no canal within the tail, but its centre is occupied by a simple series of large rectan- gular nucleated cells, producing a transversely radiated appearance, visible even when mode- rately magnified ; the tail has also an external simple layer of minute cells, as in Botryllus. Savigny, also, was led by his researches to regard both the ovum of Bolryllus and that of Pyrosoma as giving birth to several individuals having already a certain order of arrangement. This view, in the case of the Bolryllus, is, as we have seen, supported by Lowig, Kolliker, and Sars, and is considered by Van Beneden as founded on fact and supported by analogy. Milne-Edwards, however, is not disposed to admit this conclusion ; for, in his opinion, the existence of the four embryos united in a circle in the Pyrosoma, and the development of a single star of germs in the larval Bolryl- lus, do not sufficiently account for the associa- tion of many such groups in the adult age; there being, for instance, in the adult Pyrosoma, many hundred individuals of different de- grees of development. Van Beneden thinks it probable that the presumed aggregate larvae produce colonies similar to themselves by fis- siparous reproduction; but Milne-Edwards gives it as his confirmed opinion that, from the single product of the ovum, the other asso- ciated individuals arise by gemmiparqus repro- duction only. Of this mode of generation in the Botryllidce we will now proceed to give a slight sketch, again acknowledging the labours of the learned Professor of the Garden of Plants as the chief source of our information. In Diazona, Didemnum, Bolryllus, and Bo- trylloides, the common test is traversed by numerous ramifying prolongations of the inner tunic of the individual animals, terminating either simply in culs-de-sac, or swelling out into germs {fig. 785.). Savigny figured these Fig. 785. Vertical Section halfway through a Mass of Botryllus, magnified about 6 diameters. {Original), a, animals on one of the exterior surfaces of the mass; b, proliferous stolons, traversing the mass, and bearing reproductive germs. tubular bodies, and vaguely described them under the name of "marginal tubes" and "vascular branches." And Delle Chiaje*, in treating of Polyc/inium, figures and describes " vessels " which are probably these ramifying canals. These membranous tubes, with their terminal vesicular enlargements, are readily seen during life in those species that possess a semitransparent test. Milne-Edwards ob- serves that in Bolryllus and Botrylloides, {figs. 785 and 783, t, t'), each of these interior ap- pendages appears at first as a little tubercle on the surface of the abdominal portion of the inner tunic of the adult animal. The tubercle then becomes elongated, forming a tube, the free extremity of which is closed, its cavity communicating with the abdominal cavity of the animal from which it springs. The blood from the abdominal cavity circulates through- out this caecal tube, with a very active double current. As the tubes lengthen, they generally become ramified, and soon present swollen or claviform extremities. The circulation con- tinues active, and before long there is visible towards the summit of each terminal swelling a minute granular mass, the colour of which approaches that of the thorax of the adult animals situated close by. A little later this organised mass begins to present the form of a little Ascidian, and soon afterwards becomes a young animal, similar to those already occu- * Memoirs, second edition, torn. i. p. 34. tabl. 83. figs. 13. and 15.TUNICATA. 1227 pying the common mass, of which it becomes a new inhabitant. The communication be- tween the mother and the young animal be- comes obliterated ; but for some time yet, all the young individuals growing from the same branch remain united by their pedicle, and it is this union, apparently, that determines their mode of grouping into " systems." * In Di- demnum gclatinosum, the buds growing on these proliferous stolons are very different in appearance from the ova expelled by the animals ; for not only did they differ in aspect and form, but their bulk is at first twenty or thirty times less than that of the vitelline mass of the ova. In the Amaroucium proUferum, Milne-Edwards has frequently lbund on the surface of a rounded mass, formed by a colony of these animals, many little filiform twigs, simple or branched, formed by a prolongation of the common tegumentary substance, and consisting of a tube closed at the end, and enclosing, in its interior, one or more embryos in different states of develop- ment. These young individuals terminated inferiorly by a peduncle, prolonged in form of a slender tube into the common mass, and springing apparently from the abdominal tunic of an adult individual. This mode of propa- gation by buds, which the compound Ascidians possess in common with the Polypi/era, is, as we have above described, found in the Clavel- linides; the only important difference being, that in the latter the tegumentary envelope of the young is not so largely developed as in the Botryllidce, and does not become fused with that of the adults; whence it results that the individuals springing from the same stem remain isolated, instead of being united into a common mass. Anatomy of Pyrosoma. — The common tegumentary mass of Pyrosoma is semitrans- parent, subcartilaginous, toughish, and some- what extensile. The exterior of the hollow, conical, or cylindrical body, formed by the ag- gregation of the individual Pyrosomata, is co- vered with numerous elongated tubercles, of a rather firmer consistence than the rest of the mass. Each of these constitutes one extremity of an individual member of the living group. The opposite extremity opens into the cavity of the cylinder, and is not free, but, like the trunk of the individual's body, is closely connected by the common mass with the similar parts of other individuals lying above, below, and on * M.' Savigny figures a nascent system, originated apparently by this grouping of the buds; and Professor Van Beneden coincides with M. Milne- Edwards in the above view of the subject, but M. Steenstrup expresses his opinion that the mode in which the colonies and systems of the BotryUida- are formed, is not sufficiently explained by this hypo- thesis ; and, although (following Milne-Edwards) he considers M. Sars to have been misled in re- garding the ova of the Botrylli as producing groups of animals, yet he is inclined to consider this grouping to be really a foetal condition, but occur- ring in some hitherto unnoticed " aggregate " form of animal, produced from the "solitary" larvae de- scribed by Milne-Edwards, just as the solitary Salpcc bring forth Su/pa-chains. cither side of it. In some species the animals are arranged much more regularly than in others, and appear to form piled-up rings or circles of individuals, more or less analogous to the otherwise disposed circular systems of some of the Botryllidce. In Pyrosoma atlan- ticum the tubercles are simply conical, and are perforated terminally. In P.elegans, also, the external orifice of the individual opens at the extremity of the tubercle, and through it the water contained in the great cylinder has been seen to escape freely in little jets, when the Pyrosome has been taken out of the sea. In P. giganteum the tubercles are of various sizes, some being short and indistinct, and others, on the contrary, very much deve- loped. The largest are conico-cylindrical flat, and lanceolate at the extremity, with the minute branchial orifice on the inferior aspect. This lanceolate extremity is crenulated on its sharp edges, and presents on its inferior aspect, between its point and the aperture, a slightly prominent keel. The branchial orifice is sometimes surrounded by a slight, free, crenu- lated membrane. The interior of the great cavity is generally smooth. Its walls are perforated by the numerous minute anal orifices of the com- ponent individuals ; and, at a slight depth, its surface is studded with a great number of yellowish, rose-coloured, or carmine spots, which are the hepatic and other visceral organs of the numerous animals. The ter- minal aperture of the large, conical, compound body of the Pyrosoma has, according to Le- sueur and Savigny, a membranous bonier, which can be sometimes drawn together so as to close the cavity ; and Mr. F. D. Bennett observed that, when first removed from the sea, the broader extremity of the cylinder pre- sented a wide and circular orifice, forming nearly a continuous surface with the central tube ; but when the animal was kept in a vessel of sea-water, or much handled, this orifice was closed by the contraction of a smooth, dense membrane at its margin, and which either obliterated the aperture, or left but a minute central orifice; water at the same time being contained in the barrel or tube of the body. Besides the common envelope or test, each individual animal has an inner tunic or man- tle. This is a very thin, delicate membrane, attached apparently at four points only, two of which are at the extremities; that is, at the branchial and anal orifices; and the other two are at two rounded, compressed bodies, one on either side, just beyond the anterior mar- gin of the branchia?, and regarded by Savigny as ovaries. The branchicc line the inner surface of this inner tunic. They are oval in form, and their dorsal borders meet each other, and are at- tached along the dorsal aspect of the mantle ; but they are separated, at their anterior and ventral borders, by a considerable space, which is partly occupied by the ventral sinus (Jig. 786. i,i). The branchial tissue is traversed by numerous vessels anastomosing with eachTUNICATA. 1228 other at right angles. The transverse vessels, varying from 18 to 25 in number, are the Fig. 786.

The longitudinal vessels are from 11 to 17 in number. " Nothing is more curious," says Milne-Edwards*, "than the respiratory ap- paratus of these little animals, when the vi- bratile cilia, with which each of the branchial stigmata is furnished, are simultaneously ef- fecting their vorticiform movements with ra- pidity and perfect harmony." The oesophagus is curved, and is of a bright red colour. The stomach is subglo- bular, yellowish, and opaque. The intestine is short, and strongly bent on itself; the anus is directed backwards towards the posterior * Annales des Sciences Naturelles, sec. se'r. torn, xii. p. 375. 1835. orifice. The liver is a globular body, which is but slightly developed in young individuals ; its postero-inferior portion is formed of several sections united by a centre, around which they converge, presenting the appearance of a flower with many petals, or a calyx with, most usually, 7, 8, or 10 divisions. The sec- tions are not always equal. Their centre is occupied by a somewhat solid, granular sub- stance, which they more or less perfectly enclose. Its colour is generally whitish, or of a light pink. It lies free in a cavity hol- lowed out of the test, and is attached by a membranous peduncle to the stomach, or rather to the intestinal loop (Jig. 786. A, a, a, b and c e, e). These viscera are si- tuated posteriorly to the branchial sac. By their disposition they leave a free passage to the water which traverses the branchial ca- vity. The nerve-ganglion is present at the anterior extremity of the dorsal border of the branchial sac. From it there proceed filiform branches towards the neck of the external tubercle and in other directions. The vessel or sinus that runs between the two free edges of the branchiae is of considerable length, and has a slight general curve. It is divided, as it were, into four, towards its largest and an- terior portion, or rather seems to be com- posed of two contiguous vessels bent upon themselves. These diminish in calibre as they run backwards, and, passing into a delicate filiform vessel, are lost near the stomach. Two arching vessels, one on either side, pass from near the nerve-ganglion to the com- pressed oval bodies on the anterior lateral points of the branchiae, and a similar pair of vessels unite these latter bodies with the extremity of the loop formed by the vessel that lies between the free ventral margins of the branchiae. These four arched vessels form therefore a circlet around the anterior ex- tremity of the branchial sac (fig. 786. b, li). The heart is placed at the posterior part of the body, at the side of, and below, the visceral mass. Its character is perfectly analogous to that of the heart of other Ascidians. It con- tracts with the usual peristaltic movement, and changes periodically the direction of this vermicular movement, the vessels alternately playing the part of artery and vein. With regard to the generation ofthePyroso- midce, very little has yet been observed. Sa- vigny describes as "oviduct" and "siphon- canal" the vessels that occupy the usual position of the dorsal sinus, running along the dorsal or superior surface of the branchial sac (fig. 786. g,g). They have, however, no apparent connection either with the pre- sumed oviferous bodies situated at the an- terior points of the branchiae, or with the cavity posterior to the abdominal viscera occupied by the ova in Savigny's specimens (fig. 786. A, b). Lesueur discovered and described cer- tain globular, transparent bodies in Pyrosoma, situated near the liver (fig. 786. c, le), which he regarded as ova; these were noticed also by Savigny. Each enclosed four minute Py- rosomes, symmetrically disposed, and readilyTUNICATA. 1229 recognised by the form and arrangement of their double branchiae. Whether the ova of Pyrosoma be always composed of four, or a greater or less number of young individuals, or whether they ge- nerally contain but a single one, it is still highly probable that gemmiparous reproduc- tion obtains with these animals; the Jissi- parous mode, however, imagined by Peron as possibly occurring in the adult Pyrosome, is totally unsupported by evidence. The several stages of development in which the individual animals are found to exist in the common mass of the test, as noticed by Savigny, point to tliis conclusion ; and possibly the delicate filaments regarded as muscular fibres by Sa- vigny, first pointed out by the acute observer of these creatures, Lesueur, as traversing the test in a line with the abdominal cavities of the adult animals (Jig- 786. b, c), may be the proliferous stolons as yet untraced throughout their course. Phosphorescence of Pyrosoma. — M. Peron, who first discovered and established the genus, has given a lively description of the circum- stances under which the P. atlanficum were first met with by him, in his Memoire sur le Pyrosome. * " We had," says he, " for a long time been detained by calms in the equatorial regions, between 19° and 20° long, west of Paris, and 3° and 4° north lat., the temperature of the sea being at the surface 22° Reaumur ; and we could make no progress except by the aid of the short-lived storms peculiar to these climates. In the evening of the 13th Frimaire we experienced one of the strongest of these squalls ; the sky was on all sides loaded with heavy clouds ; all around the obscurity was profound ; the wind blew violently; and the ship cut her way with rapidity. Suddenly we discovered, at some distance, a great phos- phorescent band stretched across the waves, and occupying an immense tract in advance of the ship. Heightened by the surrounding circumstances, the effect of this spectacle was romantic, imposing, sublime, rivetting the at- tention of all on board. Soon we reached the illuminated tract, and perceived that the prodigious brightness was certainly and only attributable to the presence of an innumerable multitude of largish animals floating with the waves. From their swimming at different depths they took apparently different forms ; those at the greatest depth were very inde- finite, presenting much the appearance of great masses of fire, or rather of enormous red- hot cannon-balls ; whilst those more distinctly seen near the surface perfectly resembled in- candescent cylinders of iron. " Taken from the water, these animals per- fectly resembled each other in form, colour, substance, and the property of phosphores- cence, differing only in their sizes, which varied from 3 to 7 inches. The large, longish tubercles with which the exterior of the Pyro- somes was bristled were of a firmer substance and more transparent than the rest of the * Aimales du Museum d' Hist. Nat. tome iv. 1804. body, and were brilliant and polished like diamonds. These were the principal seat of phosphorescence. Between these large tu- bercles, smaller ones, shorter and more ob- tuse, could be distinguished ; these also were phosphorescent. Lastly, in the interior of the substance of the animal, could be seen, by the aid of the transparency, a number of little, elongated, narrow bodies (viscera), about a millimetre in length, which also participated in a high degree in the possession of the phosphoric light. " The colour of the animals, when at rest or when moribund, was observed to be of an opaline yellow, mingled with a disagreeable green; but during the spontaneous contrac- tions of the animals, and which were also easily excited at the pleasure of the observer, the body seemed to burn, becoming instantly like molten iron, with an extremely bright light ; but, as the phosphorescence again ceased, the colour of the animal passed suc- cessively through a number of extremely agreeable, light, and varied tints, such as red, yellow, orange, green, and azure blue, the last shade being extremely lively and pure. "Left to itself in a glass of sea-water, the Pyrosome exhibited at regular intervals of time a slight alternating movement of con- traction and dilatation. In these movements, the phosphorescence was seen to be deve- loped during the contraction, then to grow insensibly feebler, and entirely disappear, until in the next contractile movement it was quickly re-established. " By often irritating the animal, either by touching it or by shaking the water in which it floated, the phosphorescence could be ex- cited and maintained for a much longer time. Evidently dependent on the organisation and the life of the individual, after death, as is the case with all other phosphorescent marine animals, it could not be reproduced." We may remark that the observations made by Mr. F. D. Bennett*, who more than once met with shoals of P. atlanticum in lat. 1° 41' N., long. 11°56'W., and lat. 4° S., long. 18° W., differ but slightly from M. Peron's notices of the same animal. The former observed, that when the specimens were taken in the hand from a vessel of sea- water, the whole mass of the animal became instantly illuminated by myriads of bright dots, much resembling in hue the points on the wing-cases of the diamond-beetle ; and that the small specks of a brown or red colour, that were imbedded in the general tissue, and in- termingled with the prominent, rigid, pearly tubercles, appeared to him to be the chief seat of the phosphoric light, frequently re- maining bright, whilst the remainder of the body exhibited only its naturally white or yellowish hue — a hue which changed after death into a red tinge. In making a close examination of the animal, Mr. Bennett re- marked that no luminous matter was com- municated from the surface of the animal to * Proceedings of the Zoological Society, 1833 and 1837.1230 TUNICATA. any fluid or solid in contact with it. But if the Pyrosoma were cut open and immersed in water, the brown particles that escaped diffused themselves through the fluid, and shone as numerous scintillations, independent of the perfect structure. General friction or contact was not essential to elicit the perfect light of the Pyrosome, since touching one small portion of the body was sufficient to produce a brilliant glow throughout the whole. Mr. Bennett at the same time made the following observations on the effect of fresh water on phosphorescent marine animals. " Fresh water appears to act as a powerful and permanent stimulus on marine Noctilucce. Those that have intervals of repose from their phosphorescence immediately emit light when brought into contact with fresh water ; and this fact was strikingly exhibited in the Pyrosomata. When placed in a vessel of sea- water and permitted to remain quiet, these Molluscs afforded no light, and, when touched, gleamed forth only as long as the irritating cause remained, and then gradually returned to their original state. When, however, the same creatures were placed in a vessel of fresh water, they never ceased glowing with their brightest refulgence until life was extinct, which was not until the lapse of several hours. When also the same Molluscs were mutilated, or so near death as to refuse to emit light upon irritation in sea-water, immersing them in fresh water produced at least a temporary revival of their brightest gleam." Anatomy of Salpje. — The subcartilagi- nous test of Salpce is more or less cylindrical and flexible, and when taken out of the sea, often collapses into an amorphous mass. Float- ing in the water, it is iridescent or opaline, reflecting the sun's rays in beautiful rainbow tints, and hence has been derived its name of " sun-fish." The test and its lining membrane are so diaphanous, that the whole structure of the animal can be seen through them. The exterior of the test is generally smooth, but sometimes bears minute shiny protuberances of a tissue similar to its own, as in S. Tilesii. The integument over the viscera is thicker and often of a firmer consistence than the rest of the test. Its form varies considerably, not only in different species, but in the conditions of isolation and aggregation, in which each species alternately exists, and also in the different stages of growth of the individual, especially in an associated state. The test is usually either oval or oblong, but various terminal and lateral processes considerably affect its general contour. Each of its extremities is open by an orifice ; and, in the aggregated individuals, it is perfo- rated by other much smaller apertures at the points of contact between the neighbour- ing individuals of a group. The internal surface of the test is lined by the mantle, a thin, toughish membrane, which is often more conspicuous than the highly transparent external envelope. The mantle is furnished with large, generally transverse, muscular bands, the arrangement of which differs according to the species and according to the separate or associated state of existence. Its inner surface is lined with a soft mucous coat of fine epithelial tissue. The mantle is more or less closely attached to the inner sur- face of the test, especially at the two orifices (being, indeed, continuous with the test at these points), at the protuberances that arise from the test, and along the inner surfaces of the longitudinal furrows that sometimes tra- verse its external surface, as in S. cordiformis, where, on the superior and inferior surfaces, the test is depressed into broad, deep sulci. In specimens preserved in spirit, and even in some recent specimens, this membrane will sometimes separate itself, together with the viscera and vessels, from the outer tunic, and fall through one of the external orifices. Salpa have been met with floating in the sea, and executing, in some degree, their usual movements of contraction and dilatation; in which, from mutilations caused by parasites or other accidents, little remained except a few muscular bands of the mantle. Considerable confusion has existed among naturalists as to which is the anterior extre- mity, and which the superior surface of the Satpa. We shall regard, as the anterior or branchial orifice, that in the neighbourhood of which the stomach and heart are usually found (fig. 787.); and as the posterior or anal orifice, that which points in the direction of the ani- mal's retrograde motion ; and as the superior or dorsal surface, that on which the nerve- ganglion is present; and as the inferior or ventral, that in close contact with which the viscera and heart, forming the " nucleus " or "paqnet" of authors, are placed. The orifices are either terminal, or are situ- ated at the base of the terminal prolongations of the test. The anterior orifice is destitute of tentacular appendages ; it is furnished with sphincter muscles ; it is simple and tubular in S. cristata, S. Tilesii, and S. scutigera, &c, and transverse in S. cordiformis, S. zonaria, &c. When the dilatation of the animal is drawing water into the cavity of the body, the sphincters of this orifice are brought into action and close it, so that the water enters by the opposite extremity. The posterior orifice is a transverse slit, furnished with a few muscular fascicles, and is larger than the opposite orifice. In S. cris- tata its superior lip is simple and thin; its inferior lip is externally a rounded ridge, formed by a fold of the test, which, within its inner border, constitutes a semilunar valve. This allows the water to enter easily, but pre- vents its escape when the animal contracts itself. The constrictor muscles of the mantle are often subannular, interrupted on one or the other surface, decussating in some, connected in others. The following are a few examples of the disposition of these muscular bands. In S. cristata, around the tubular anterior ori- fice, are 4—5 sphincter muscles ; the first of which, as well as the last two, are continuous1231 TUNICATA. around the tube. The last two send lateral processes backwards, forming, with the suc- ceeding band, the first on the trunk, and also annular, large rhomboidal meshes ; two other annular bands succeed and form large meshes by intercommunications on the upper and lower surfaces. From these last muscles two intercommunicating processes are sent off on each side to the crestlike prominence of the test. From the last band several branches run backwards to be distributed to the upper and lower lips of the posterior orifices. In S. Tilesii the anterior orifice is provided ■with two lateral penniform muscles. The other muscles form six bands nearly parallel with each other, interrupted along the me- dian line of the superior surface, and not reaching further than halfway down the sides of the body. The most anterior band is somewhat forked, and the most posterior gives some branches to the superior lip of the posterior orifice, and joins, at the angle of the lips, a radiating group of other fascicles, that are distributed to the inferior lip. In S. scutigera the muscular bands are few. On the superior surface, two pairs of decus- sating muscles are seen, and other smaller bands occur near the extremities. In S. ey- lindrica there are eleven transverse bands, interrupted and separated by a considerable space on the inferior surface of the body ; the first six of which are parallel one to another, whilst the four following are bent towards each other on the median line of the body; the last band, and some short lateral fascicles, are arranged close by the posterior ex- tremity. In S. fusiformis there are seven transverse bands ; some of which are parallel with, and approaching others on the sides of the animal, and others are more or less obliquely arranged. In S. cordiformis there are six broad transverse muscles on each side of the animal, not meeting on either surface. Two narrow, looplike fascicles, one above and one below, arising from the last branchial bands, and two short, transverse, lateral slips, act as sphincters to the posterior orifice. A pair of narrow muscular fascicles are sent off from the first of the branchial muscles to the anterior orifice. In S. zonaria (the aggregate form or " proles " of S. cordiformis) there are also six transverse bands interrupted only on one surface, and differing consider- ably from those of S. cordiformis, as do the distinct sets of muscles distributed to the two orifices. In S.runcinata (solitary) (fig.772. a) the muscular bands are nine in number, placed on the dorsal surface; three anterior and three posterior, approximated at their centres, and three parallel bands in the middle. In S. runcinata (aggregate) (fig. 772. b) there are six muscles, besides those of the orifices ; four anterior and two posterior, approximating on the median lines. The branchia is single, in the form of a riband-like tube, stretched, on a vertical plane, obliquely across the central or branchial cavity of the body, so that it is constantly bathed by the water traversing this cavity. It consists of a double membrane formed by a fold of the internal tunic or mantle, and springs anteriorly from the visceral nucleus between the oeso- phageal opening and the orifice of the rectum ; it then becomes free, and ultimately terminates on the superior part of the thoracic cavity, below the point where the nerve-ganglion and the oculiform organ are found. It thus di- vides the branchial cavity into tvvo portions — the antero-dorsal or pharyngeal, and the postero-ventral or cloacal. The inferior border of the branchia exhibits an infinite number of minute transverse ves- sels, all parallel to each other. There is usually only a single row of these transverse vessels on each side of the foliole of the bran- chia ; but sometimes there are many rows, which indicate the presence of many longi- tudinal vessels, and thereby approach the character of the branchial tissue of the As- cidians. Savigny observed in S. octofora another small branchia near the anterior insertion of the large branchia. The whole inner surface of the branchial sac of the Salpas seems, from its high degree of vascularity, to be subservient to the purposes of respiration. The vascular tissue of the bran- chia, consisting of longitudinal and transverse vessels, is equivalent to the vertical bran- chial network dividing transversely the respi- ratory cavity of the Clavellince. The single branchial lamina of Salpce ap- pears to constitute the transition from the AscidicB to the Teredines; in the latter there are two elongated branchial laminae above the intestine, and within the tubular mantle, to which the water has access and egress by means of two tubes placed at the posterioi extremity of the body. The intestinal canal is opaque, fuscous, or variously tinted, generally closely folded or convolute, and sometimes enveloped in the liver, forming altogether the " visceral nucleus." This, together with the heart, lies external to the mantle, between it and the test. The oesophageal aperture is in the anteroinferior part of the body, behind the heart, more or less conspicuous and variously modified; dissimilar in the alternate " proles " of the same species. In the solitary " proles" of S. pinnata and S. affinis it is stretched above the branchia. In the aggregate " pro- les " of S. pinnata it is opened out longwise, and of a violet colour in the living specimen. In 5. crisfata the intestinal canal has the following characters. The oesophagus is round, with a loosely plicated margin ; the sto- mach has a contrary direction to the rest of the canal, being a cul-de-sac pointing ante- rior^, and situated in the thickness of the antero-inferior protuberance of the test. It is membranous and transparent, and is de- scribed by Cuvier as ordinarily containing a little greyish fluid. The intestine is a simple tube having a direction unusual among the Salpians ; it runs from the stomach towards the posterior extremity of the body, where it opens into the branchial cavity by a rather1232 TUNICATA. large anus. The faecal matter contained in it is greenish and vermiform. The liver (testicle, Krohn) in this species appears to be composed of large, parallel, longitudinal filaments, and terminates posteriorly in a delicate, tapering point. It differs also from the liver of other species in being of a whitish colour. The intestine of the Salpians is usually twisted once or twice either around or within the liver, with the anus terminating nearly free of the latter, near the anterior attachment of the bronchia. The anus is generally on the left side, opening posteriorly. The rectum never traverses the heart. In S. gibbosa and S. infundibuliformis the intestine makes a little more than one turn, the two ends crossing one another a little. It has two cceca, one on each side, which are turned into the centre of the loop of the intestine. Eschricht describes the liver of S. zonaria as conspicuous, enve- loping nearly all the alimentary canal, and consisting of a mass of ccecal tubes, each of which bear, near their free extremities and on one side only, a group of 2—6 minute, short ccecal appendages. The heart is with difficulty observed in dead specimens, but, from its pulsating move- ments, is generally conspicuous in the living animals; and in these only can the circulatory apparatus be traced out. It is situated in the antero-inferior region of the body, near the visceral nucleus, the anterior attachment of the branchia, and the generative organs. It is a somewhat long, pellucid, tubuliform ve- sicle, enclosed in an immoveable pericardium. A longitudinal vessel or sinus (aorta, of Van Hasselt) traverses the inferior surface of the branchial cavity, and is continued into the in- ferior lip of the posterior orifice, and into the base of the posterior prolongation (if present) of the test. Hence it is retroflexed and recur- rent. It gives off numerous branches at right angles on either side {Jig. 787.) from which arise Fig. 787. Salpa maxima; showing the viscera and large vessels. The fine vascular net-work of the branchial sac is not introduced. {After Milne-Edwards.) a, upper lip of posterior orifice; b, anterior orifice ; c, abdomen, containing the visceral nucleus; d, bran- chial lamina; e, heart;/, oculiform point;g, g, pro- longations of the test, by which the animal is ad- herent to its neighbours. a great number of smaller branches, that sub- divide, anastomose, and spread out in different parts of the body, forming a fine vascular net- work. All the transverse canals open into a large dorsal vessel, which thus receives all the blood which has passed through the vessels of the branchial sac ; but, besides this, some blood is also received by it, which has not passed through this tissue, in consequence of the great dorsal vessel being connected at each extremity with the great thoracic or abdominal vessel by two considerable annular vessels. The blood returns downwards from the dorsal vessel through a canal lying on the dorsal surface of the abdomen (dorsal canal) to the opposite end of the heart. The vascular net-work is very conspicuous in S. aspcra, and is sometimes particularly distinct in the appendages. These ramifications go off from one another at right angles, and afterwards are, for the most part, bent back archwise, as Chamisso and Van Hasselt have observed; so that, with the exception of those running transversely, all these little vessels have a direction contrary to that of the principal vessels ; that is to say, they are directed from behind forwards, whilst the aorta runs from before backwards. At the anterior extremity of the heart are two ves- sels, that answer to the pulmonary veins (dorsal sinus). They are equally distributed in the body of the animal, anastomosing with the branches of the principal sinus (aorta). The circulation of the blood among the vis- cera is carried on by means of variable in- terspaces occurring between these organs. The motions of the heart are made spirally, by a twisting of its parietes, and always begin from one or other of its extremities. As in other Tunicata, this action is oscillatory, having an alternately contrary direction, first impelling the blood in one direction, then stopping, contracting again, and soon impelling it in an opposite direction ; so that, after the blood has been flowing for some time from the heart to the aorta, to be distributed to the body, it stops, and then begins to run by the ar- teries and the aorta to the heart, and from thence, by the pulmonary veins and their anas- tomoses, it returns into the arteries and aorta. The contractions of the heart, in general very regular, diminish in rapidity at the ap- proach of the periodic change in the circu- lation, the blood stopping, and even retreat- ing a little until a general contraction of the body determines it to take an opposite direction. The duration of the opposite cir- culation is not always the same. Van Has- selt saw the blood flow for three-fourths of a minute from the heart to the aorta; and, dur- ing this time he observed forty-two contrac- tions of the heart; and he saw it reflow from the arteries to the heart and the pulmonary veins for a third of a minute, and in this inter- val he counted sixty-two pulsations. The motion of the blood is the more per- ceptible as it is full of minute white globules, which pass through the minute vessels in a sin- gle row, and are easily seen through the trans- parent parietes. These observations may be still more assisted by holding the animal vertically, with the nucleus downwards; when, as the blood, driven into the ventral sinus, is forced to ascend against its own weight, its current is less1233 TUNICATA. rapid, and the movements of the blood-discs can be more easily followed. "As these blood- globules are of a certain consistence, a resist- ance," says Van Hasselt, " is necessarily cre- ated in the whole mass of the blood, which ultimately overcomes the projectile power of the heart. After a short interval, during which the opposite forces are balanced, the heart assumes a spiral movement, contrary to the preceding. Hence it follows," he ob- serves, " that, since the blood is driven as much backward as forward in the vessels of the body, and since it is only by their anas- tomoses that the circulation can be said to be carried on, all the system of the pulmonary vessels can consist only in accessory ramifica- tions, which have no direct influence on the principal circulation ; and that two separate systems, arterial and venous, do not exist, the two being united, or rather never having been separate."* The nerve-ganglion is more or less de- veloped in all the Salpians. It is situated on the superior surface of the thoracic chamber, near the posterior extremity, and just above the insertion of the branchia. In its neigh- bourhood is often observed a pigmentary spot, or rudimentary organ of vision. In S. cordiformis the ganglion appears as a compound body, formed of two central glo- bular portions and four irregular lateral ap- pendages, two on a side. Numerous filaments radiate off in every direction. Four of these filaments are sent towards the posterior ori- fice, two of them passing on either side of the space described by Prof. Eschricht as the " oval organ." This latter is a long slit with ' an inner smooth rim, and an outer oval, trans- versely striated border. In S. zonaria the gan- glion is a somewhat triangular, globose body, with a single appendix on each side, sending off four anterior filaments, two lateral pairs and a posterior pair. The " oval organ," situ- ated between the last pair, is close up to the ganglion, and less distinct than in S. cordiformis. Many of the Salpce are highly phosphores- cent f ; but sometimes this condition is due to the presence of phosphorescent Crusta- ceans inhabiting their internal cavity. The long chains of phosphorescent Salpa: swim- ming near the surface, have been described as occasionally producing the effect of long ribands of fire drawn along by the currents. Generation of Sulpce. — " One of the most important discoveries," says M. KrohnJ,"with which physiology has been enriched in our da3s, is without contradiction that of the * Extrait d'un Lettre de Van Hasselt, sur les Biphores, le 12 Aout, 1821 (Algem.

IV. remarkable phenomena observed in many inferior animals, and termed, ' propagation by alternate generations.'" To M. Steenstrup* the merit is incontestably due, of having been the first to bring together, in an ingenious man- ner, all the facts belonging to the subject. In treating of the phenomena observed by Cha- misso in one species of Salpa, and analogous phenomena studied in other groups of animals, and in his generalisations of the facts, M. Steen- strup has placed them in a strong light, and given them their full value. M. Steenstrup's observations have also tended to strengthen the views of Chamisso-|- so often contested ; and the researches of M. Kiohn, on the natural history and zootomy of eight species of Salpa-, fully confirm them. J Every Salpian is viviparous; and each species, as shown by Chamisso, is propagated by an alternate suc- cession of dissimilar generations. One of these generations is represented by solitary or isolated individuals ; the other by aggregated or associated individuals, united into groups known as " chains." Each isolated individual engenders a group of aggregated individuals, and each of these produces in its turn a solitary individual. The isolated individuals are therefore muciparous, and the associated individuals uniparous. This is not the only difference existing between the two alternating generations ; for, if we compare the associated individuals representing the aggregate gener- ation, with the solitary individual forming the isolated generation, we shall find that they differ amongst themselves not only with respect to external conformation, but also in many particulars of organisation. The definition, then, of species should in this ease include the characteristics of the two dissimilar generations, isolated and aggregate, which alternately succeed each other. It is desirable therefore, for the determination of each species, to preserve but one name.

Steenstrup, in his memoir on the Alternation of Generation (edit. Roy. Soc. pp. 39 and following), gives a full account of the different views of Chamisso, Meyer, and Eschricht, with regard to the develop- ment of the Salpa. He allots considerable space to the consideration of the arguments of the learned Danish professor, with whose opinions, however, he does not coincide, acknowledging that all his own re- searches tend to support the observations of Chamisso. M. Steenstrup notices that the alternate genera- tions of Salpa are precisely analogous to the phe- nomena observed in the propagation of Medusa aurita. This free-swimming Medusa always pro- duces a progeny which is poh'piform and destitute of the power of locomotion, but which ultimately brings forth, by tissiparous generation, a progeny consisting of free-swimming Medusa, which never assume the polypoid form ; and this alternation is constant. M. Sars observes, on the generation of Salpa! (Erichson's Archiv. 1841, t. i. p. 29.), that " the SalpcE correspond in this with the Medusa, that it is not their larva which are developed into the perfect animal, but the progeny of the larva; it is not the individual, but the generation, which is metamorphosed." 4 K1234 TUNICATA. must comprehend the two dissimilar states which have hitherto been falsely considered as two distinct species, and to which have been given specific names, that can now serve only to designate one or the other of the hetero- morphous conditions.* Amongst the characters that distinguish the different generations of each species of Salpa, one of the most remarkable is offered by the disposition of the muscular bands. These are variable in the two generations, but constant for each of them. There is, however, a still more essential difference, and that is, the mode of propagation peculiar to each generation. The aggregate individuals proceeding from the isolated individuals grow by gemmation within the mother animals, on a cylindrical prolongation, which may justly be termed a proliferousj" stolon, but which differs from stolons observed in many other animals, in not ever appearing externally. — The stolons of the " social" Ascidians spring up bare, the animal not being connected by a common gelatinous envelope, as is the case with the "compound" Ascidians; in which latter group the stolons necessarily remain hidden in the common envelope, somewhat approaching in this respect the stolons of the Salpians. The solitary Salpians derived from the aggregate generation are, on the contrary, produced by a process more complicated namely, by means of the sexual functions,—the concurrence of the eggs and the sperm. Generation in the "aggregate" Salpians, — With very few exceptions, the individual aggregate Salpians produce only one offspring throughout their Hfe+, so that, if we examine them at one period, anterior to fecundation, we find a single egg, and, at a later period, a fcetus. The egg is distinctly visible within the young aggregate individual before it has left its parent (isolated) Salpian ; and as the fecundation of this egg takes place immediately, or at least a very short time after, the birth of the young aggregate Salpa, it can be examined before fecundation, that is, during the development of the aggregate within the isolated individual, or shortly after its birth. The egg is lodged in the thickness of the internal tunic of the mother, at a little dis- tance from the inner wall of the respiratory cavity. It is very clearly distinguishable in the aggregate embryo at a period intermediate be- tween the appearance of the solitary embryo as a bud and its full development. It is then situated above the visceral mass, at the an- terior extremity of the body, and nearly in the middle line, raising the external tunic into a slight prominence. It is spherical, and consists of a vitellus, containing the germinal vesicle and spot, and invested with a membrane so thick, that M. Krohn is led to regard it as comparable with the " calyx" in birds. During the progress of the development of the ani- mal, the position of the egg is altered, and it becomes situated on the side of the body, somewhat approaching towards its superior surface, and behind the second muscular band. This position is retained by the egg, and sub- sequently by the fcetus. To the posterior extremity of the egg a cord is attached, which serves as a sort of peduncle, in general directed nearly horizontally back- wards, and consisting apparently of a pro- longation of the membrane that covers the vitellus. At the period when the egg oc- cupies the anterior extremity of the embryo, this cord is proportionally thicker and shorter than at the subsequent periods of the em- bryo's development. M. Krohn considered it as being the nutritive peduncle of the ovarian capsule, or membrane, enveloping the egg. This cord exists, as above described, up to the time of fecundation, but it soon after- wards disappears. The ovary, we see, is * To the above observations, M. Krohn has added the following list of such species of Salpa as he had been enabled to recognise in the two states: — In the Solitary State {Proles solitaria, Chamisso). Species. 1.

The testicle, on the contrary, is well developed, but, not increasing in bulk in proportion to the growth of the young Salpa, it only acquires its greatest development in nearly adult animals. It is always found in the neighbourhood of the intestine, but its position varies in different species. Some- times occupying the centre of the visceral mass or nucleus, formed by the intestinal loop and its appendages, its presence is evident only in proportion as it raises those parts ; sometimes showing itself quite exposed, it more or less covers a large portion of the digestive apparatus. This organ in the aggregate form of Salpa pinnata, S. pro- boscidalis, &c. is spindle-shaped, and rests against the intestine, and has been taken for the liver by Cuvier, Chamisso, and Meyen. The testicle is composed of a greater or less number of ramified canals, the last ramifica- tions of which end in culs-de-sac. All these canals end in a principal duct, which, passing along the terminal portion of the intestine, opens at the side of the anus in the great natatory or respiratory cavity traversing the body of the Salpa. The testicle is very much slower in its de- velopment than the egg organ in these ani- mals ; and, as young aggregate Salpians are met with in which a fecundated egg and undeveloped testicle are co-existent, these individuals must have had connection with others in which the development of the latter organ was further advanced ; the sperm that fecundated the eggs being supplied by another group of animals. The maturity of the sperm does not coincide with that of the egg, yet, as the two sexual organs are present in the same bod}', these animals are herma- phrodite, although probably not self-impreg- nating. They have two generative functions to perform : the one to produce a new being, the other to fecundate an ulterior genera- tion of animals similar in all respects to themselves. The "aggregate" Salpians pro- bably perish soon after they have given birth to their "isolate" offspring. The placenta, or attachment of the fecial "iso- late" in the " aggregate" Salpce.—The embryos of the Salpa;, undergoing all the phases of de- velopment within their mother, adhere to her by the aid of an organ, the use of which is to furnish them with the necessary nutritive ele- ments. These elements being derived from the blood of the mother, the vessels of the latter enter largely into the composition of this organ. Its structure and form vary much according to the mode of propagation peculiar to each generation. The propagation in the "iso- lated " Salpians is by gemmation, and here the organ in question is the proliferous stolon. In the " aggregate" Salpian, on the other hand, this organ is represented by a body generally round, situated on the inferior surface of their smgle foetus, and fixed to the internal wall of the maternal cavity, precisely in the position occupied by the egg, and to this organ many naturalists have with reason attributed the functions of a placenta. This Dlacenta is ordinarily situated in the external tunic of the foetus; its structure is far from being well known. In appearance it is a soft, whitish, or brownish pulp, traversed by nu- merous vessels ; it is attached by a very short pedicle, which is formed by a prolongation proceeding from the inner tunic, and envelop- ing this organ. The vessels distributed in the interior of the placenta communicate with four trnnks, two of which communicate with the vascular system of the foetus, and the other two with that of the mother. Those of the foetus, in descending towards the placenta, traverse the peduncle; the one conducting the blood to this organ, and the other re- turning it to the foetus. The two maternal trunks have analogous functions ; they ter- minate at the point where the placenta is attached to the mother. Each of these fcetal and maternal trunks alternately act as arteries and veins. This alternation is due to the periodic changes that determine the contrac- tions of the heart in Tunicates generally. The vessels of the foetus and of the mother are not in direct communication ; but, as in Mammalia, they are merely contiguous. M. Krohn's microscopical observations also tend to prove that the maternal blood never com- mingles with the fcetal blood. The blood-cor- puscles of the foetus are distinguishable from those of the mother by their less size and by the more constant regularity of their forms. The development of the placenta com- mences at any early stage of enbryonic life, and in its progress corresponds to that of the foetus. Ultimately the placenta becomes detached from the maternal tissues, and is carried away by the young born animal. It remains for a long time in connection with the young animal, but decreases rapidly in size, and ultimately disappears before the full growth of the animal is perfected. Eleohlast of the fetal Salpa:. — There is another organ belonging to the fcetus, men- tioned by authors, especially Chamisso, Me\en, and Krohn, which is a round whitish body, lodged, like the placenta, in the external tunic of the fcetus. Its use is entirely un- known. It appears to be composed of a multitude of fascicles or lamellas, that, by their intercrossing with one another, cir- cumscribe cellular cavities, filled with a per- fectly clear oily liquid, composed chiefly of globules. The fascicles or lamellas are tra- versed by numerous vessels opening into two trunks, which apparently form the at- tachment between this organ and the visceral nucleus. Meyen thought it to be the vitelline sac of the foetus ; but, according to M. Krohn, this opinion is inadmissible, because the " aggregate" embryos, which we know are not produced from e«gs, are provided with it. This bod}', M. Krohn terms the "eleoblast." During the incubation of the foetus, and afterTUNICATA. 1236 the birth of the individual, the changes of volume undergone by this organ correspond in general to those of the placenta ; but its decrease proceeds more slowly, and its re- mains are observable long after the placenta has disappeared. Development of the fcetal " isolate " Sal/pas, — The development of the fcetal "isolate" Salpa occupies a considerable time, not being accomplished until the mother has almost attained her full growth. Of the progress of the genesic phenomena, there is as yet but little clearly known. The first changes mani- fest in the egg after fecundation, are the early disappearance of the germinal vesicle and spot, the increase of the egg in size, and the loss of its ovular, and assumption of a spherical, form. Soon afterwards the egg,so transformed, is replaced by a round body, which raises the internal tunic of the mother into a slight nipple-like prominence, projecting into the internal cavity of the latter. This is the rudi- mentary placenta, and is channelled by a cavity which is in direct communication with the two maternal vessels previously spoken of. These vessels are at this period very mi- nute, but they quickly increase in size. By their means a current of blood is already es- tablished in the interior of the rudimentary placenta. The maternal blood carried by one of the vessels of the cavity rises on one side towards its base, and then, describing an arch, descends on the other side, to return to the mother by the opposite vessel. The first rudiment of the fcetus is, it seems, developed after the appearance of the placenta. It is at first a very minute body, formed on the sum- mit of the placenta and under its envelope : this covering is a continuation of the internal tunic of the mother, and becomes, at a later period, the external tunic of the fcetus. The organs soon appear in the rudimentary embry- onic mass. The respiratory cavity, M. Krohn observes, is, probably, one of the first parts formed, the fcetus, previously solid, be- coming evidently hollow ; immediately after- wards the rudiments of the branchia and the nervous ganglion are perceptible ; the visceral nucleus, the eleoblast, and the heart become distinct only at a late period. When the eleoblast is developed, it is placed anterior to the visceral nucleus, and the heart then begins to contract, although feebly. It is only when the fcetus acquires a better determined form, that the two orifices of the body become visible, the posterior at an earlier period than the anterior. The fcetus now surpasses the placenta in volume, although the latter has not, since its appearance, ceased to grow ; and the nervous ganglion, distinguishable from all other parts by its rapid growth, is conspicuous from its volume, compared to that of the other organs, and gives origin to numerous nerve-filaments. The eleoblast, the volume of which is considerably increased, tends to place itself below the nucleus. It is at this period also that we can clearly dis- tinguish the muscular bands, although in a yet imperfect state. Each band is represented by two lateral symmetrical portions, separated one from another by a large interval along the superior surface of the body ; it is not until a later period that the two portions are united into a single band. The placenta also exhibits a marked change. The cavity that it con- tained disappears, and its place is occupied by the pulpy whitish substance before spoken of. At a more advanced stage, but still far from the full term of development, the fcetus presents a form that subsequently is but little altered. Its volume, compared with that of the placenta, is greater than before. The eleoblast, as yet less than the placenta, is now placed behind it, and soon equals it in size. The distribution of the vessels on the different parts of the fcetus is become more apparent; and the two trunks enclosed in the peduncle of the placenta are distinguishable. Now also the contractions of the heart may be seen to change their direction periodically, the blood consequently circulating in the same singular manner as in the adult Salpians. But another still more remarkable phenomenon manifests itself at this period, viz. the precocious form- ation of the stolon proliferum, which springs from near the heart, in the form of a little button. During the later periods of development, the resemblance of the fcetus to the adult be- comes more marked daily, as well as its increase of volume compared with the pla- centa. The fcetus, which in the last period referred to already showed some indication of spontaneous movement, commences to alter- nately contract and dilate its body, like the adult animal. These movements, feeble at first, are before long, as the animal approaches its full term, executed with considerable vigour. The fcetus being attached to its mo- ther, these movements cannot displace it; and their only end, without doubt, is to draw towards it the supply of water necessary for its respiration. As regards the stolon proli- ferum, its growth during all this time is so slow, that, even at the time of the birth of the animal, it is but a short, delicate filament. Nevertheless, on a close examination, there may be perceived on its surface a serrated edge of minute elevations, indicating the first vestiges of the buds that will subsequently be developed into embryos. Generation in the "isolate'''' Salpians. — The " isolate " Salpians are, as we before mentioned, gemmiparous, and have their young produced on a small pedunculated organ, the stolon proliferum, which is visible within the single fcetus whilst still contained within its " aggre- gate " mother. It then exists as a very slen- der short filament, but already gives indica- tions of buds upon its surface. After the birth of the animal, it increases in size in pro- portion to the continually increasing number of buds that spring from it. It is fixed by one of its extremities to the heart of the mother : and it is always at this extremity that the stolon produces new germs. The grow th of the buds, just as the nutrition of the embryos, being entirely dependent on the blood of theTUNICATA. 1237 mother, the stolon is constructed to admit a proportional quantity of the vital fluid. Two vessels traverse it throughout its length, one proceeding from the anterior extremity of the maternal heart, and the other from the oppo- site end. Hence the blood, forced into one of these vessels by the contraction of the heart, returns by the other ; and at each time the heart commences to contract in an opposite direction, the two vessels quickly coincide in the change. M. Milne Edwards has demon- strated that the proliferous stolons of the so- cial and compound Ascidians are likewise traversed by two similar vessels, one of which has an ascending current of blood, and the other a descending current. In examining the stolon at a more advanced period of its growth, one may embrace at a view, owing to the successive germination of buds, the complete series of the phases passed through by each embryo, from the time of its first ap- pearance in the form of a little button, to the full term of its development (fig. 788.).

It necessarily follows that the embryos during growth must be arranged in the same manner. The em- bryos are always placed in such a manner that the axes of their bodies cross the axis of the * The development of the fcetal " aggregate" Salpians is beautifully illustrated in the fourth and fifth plates of Prof. Eschricht's Paper on the Salpa?, in the Royal Trans. Copenhag. vol. viii. 1841. stolon at a right angle : they adhere among themselves by means of their organs of attach- ment. The development of the "isolate," like that of the " aggregate," feetus proceeds but slowly: the growth of those fcetuses that spring from the first-formed germs is not ter- minated until after the mother has almost at- tained her full age. It is easily conceived that, as the number of buds continues to augment dining all the time the mother grows, the form of the germs and the embryos, or the embryonic chain, acquires lastly a consider- able length. Lodged in the external tunic of the mother, and adhering to the heart of the latter by the aid of the vessels of the stolon, this embryonic chain sometimes passes directly backward, and terminates before reaching the posterior extremity of the bod)', as in the iso- lated generation of Salpa pinriata and some allied species: sometimes, as in most other species, it curls itself around the visceral nucleus, describing several spiral turns, and terminates at the anterior extremity of the body. If we examine the embryonic chain at this period, we may observe three very distinct groups of embryos (fig. 788.). The proximal group (f, e) is made up of the germs anil of the embryos, as yet but little deve- loped, that succeed them. These present a progressive series of the early phases of em- bryonic development; but the next group (d, e) is composed of embryos much further developed, and these being nearly all of the same size, offer but a slight trace of gradation. The distal group of embryos (/;, a) having arrived almost at their full growth, present no great difference among themselves. The em- bryos, products of the same stolons, leave the mother in groups, and the group most deve- loped is necessarily the first to be born. The perfect uniformity in the size of the newly born individuals explains also why the ani- mals of Salpa-chains are all of the same size and form. The embryonic chain of S. pinnata, however, and allied species, never presents these distinct groupings. Here, on the contrary, the phases of development proceed regularly, following the order of pro- gression throughout the chain. Hence the newly born animals, grouped in a circle, are often somewhat unequal in size j but this irre- gularity soon disappears. The embryonic chain, as we have seen, is lodged in the external tunic of the mother. During the earlier periods of its growth, the substance of the tunic envelops it so closely, that no interval is apparent between them ; but, as the mass of embryos increases in size, there is formed around it, and chiefly around the most fully developed group of embryos, a cavity which is prolonged towards the surface of the mother's body, and opens externally by a large orifice. By this orifice the embryos, when mature, make their exit. The posi- tion of this opening always corresponds with the point where the embryonic chain happens to terminate, which is sometimes near the anterior extremity, but sometimes even at the posterior extremity of the body of the 4 k 3TUNICATA. 1233 mother. At the moment of the birth of a set of embryos, they detach themselves from that part of the stolon which supported them, and it then withers and disappears. The embryos, as we have seen, are placed along the stolon in such a manner, that the axes of their bodies cross the axis of the stolon at right angles. This original position of the individual either persists from birth throughout life, or is changed, accordingly as the new-born animals belong to one or other of the three types of aggregate form to which the associated Salpes are hereafter referred. In the associated Salpes of the first type, the relative position of the individuals remains such as it was at birth. In the Salpians of the third type, however, a change of posi- tion of the young individuals is very mani- fest, for the form of the generality of these Salpians is not quite perfected at birth. The two pyramidal processes with which the bodies of S. maxima and S. fusiforniis are furnished, are but slightly developed in the newly born animals. The growth of these prolongations during youth is accompanied with marked changes' in the position of the respective in- dividuals of the group. When these processes are but small, the body of the animal is slightly inclined to the axis of the chain. This direc- tion becomes the more oblique as the two prolongations increase ; and lastly, when they have attained their full growth, the animal is perfectly parallel to the axis of the chain ; and now the development of the " aggregate" Salpian is accomplished. Mode of arrangement and attachment of a didt " aggregate" Sa/pce.— Each group of aggregate Sa/pis\H composed of a greater or less number of individuals of the same size. Sometimes the individuals are grouped in a simple cir- cular series around a common axis, as in S. pinnata, and some allied species. Sometimes the individuals are arranged one after another in two longitudinal, parallel series, and so dis- posed that the individuals of one series alter- nate with those of the opposite series {fig. 772. c). The biserial aggregation presents numerous variations, according to the diver- sities and forms peculiar to the associated individuals of different species. In these diversified modes of assemblage, M. Krohn points out three types, to which all the va- riations are reducible. The first is charac- terised by the vertical position of the animals forming the chain, so that the axes of their bodies cross the axis of the chain at a right angle (Sa/pa bicaudata, S. ferruginca). In the second type the bodies of the individuals are more or less inclined to the axis of the chain (S. mucronata, S. Tilesii). The third group is distinguished by the horizontal position of the component animals, the axis of their bodies being more or less parallel to the axis of the chain (S. maxima, S. fusiforniis, S. punctata, S. zonaria).* * Meyen also made an analogous distribution of the aggregate Salpians. Vide Nova Acta Nat. Cur. torn. xvi. " Supplementutn." In each group the individuals are in such close approximation, that there exists no in- terval between them, and the entire group appears as one mass. The individuals touch one another by the inferior surface, and more or less also by the lateral surfaces of their bodies. The superior surface, that where the nervous ganglion is situated, and the two orifices, remain perfectly free. Thus, for ex- ample, in a chain in which the individuals are disposed vertically or obliquely to its axis, the members of each rank are united to those of the opposite rank by their inferior surfaces, and to their collateral neighbours by their lateral surfaces. But, however closely the individuals may adhere one to another, mutual contact of the surfaces would not have been sufficient to maintain their juxtaposition, had not other appliances been furnished. There are sometimes appendages of considerable size, sometimes small protuberances, or only circumscribed points of the surface of the body, by the aid of which the animals adhere among themselves so strongly, that they can rarely be separated without some effort. These special organs and facets of attachment have been very incorrectly regarded by some authors as suckers. Their number varies according to the mode of aggregation. The associated individuals of Sa/pa pinnata and allied species, grouped in a circle, are provided with only a single large appendage, springing from the in- ferior surface of the body, and resembling sometimes a crest (S. pinnata), sometimes a horn (S. proboscidalis). The individuals, few in number, are united by the extremities of these appendages, which meet one another in the centre of the group. The organs of attachment of Salpce aggregated in chains are protuberances and facets, generally about eight in number. Four are placed in pairs on the inferior aspect of each animal, and serve to unite it to its two neighbours in the opposite series ; of the two other pairs, one pair occupies one of the lateral laces, the other the opposite lateral surface, uniting the individual to its two collateral neighbours. The position of these organs varies accord- ing to the form of the associated individuals, and accordingly as they belong to one or the other of the above mentioned types. Of these appendages we may notice the two prolonga- tions ol" the body common in most of the aggregate forms of the third type, as in S. maxima, S. fusiforniis, and chiefly by means of which the contact of the individuals is pre- served. Both are pyramidal in form, and arise one from the anterior and the other from the posterior extremity of the body. We will here remark that an individual cannot spontaneously separate itself from the group of which it forms a part. It is true that free individuals are often met with, but their separation is always due to some acci- dent. M. Krohn thinks even that the union in groups is so necessary to the maintenance of the life of each animal, that it soon perishes if by chance it becomes detached.Anatomy of Pelonaia.* — Muscular sys- tem.— The mantle is similar to that of other Tunicates, possessing longitudinal anil circular fibres ; the former in P. corrucala forming a thick bundle at their origin round the respira- tory opening. A strong band of transverse fibres passes round it, in one species, imme- diately below the anal orifice, encroaching on the cavity principally on that side. The chief peculiarity of the mantle is its firm adhesion to the test. Fig. 789.

These plaits are less apparent along the course of the * From Forbes and Goodsir, he. cit.

The internal sur- face of the sac exhibits along one side the ser- pentine double cord which contains the bran- chial vein ; along the other side the branchial artery ; and from these primary and secondary perpendicular branches proceed, as in other Tunicata. The transverse plaits on the ex- ternal surface of the sac correspond to the primary or transverse branches of the vessels on the internal surface. During the life of the animal, without doubt, cilia exist in great abundance on the edges of the lozenge-shaped spaces of the sac. The oesophagus commences by a white plicated opening at the lower end, and on one side of the sac (Jig. 789.). It is curved in a sigmoid form, and exhibits longitudinal rugae through its coats. Near the lower end of the mantle-cavity it terminates by suddenly dilating into the stomach (/;), which is pear-shaped, and directed obliquely upwards towards the side opposite to the oesophagus. The internal surface of the stomach presents longitudinal plica;. It is succeeded by the intestine, which at first curves upward, and then down to the bottom of the branchial cavity, up along the oesophageal side of that cavity and between its walls and the branchial artery, terminating about the anterior third of the animal in a funnel-shaped anus (i), which is cut into ten or eleven processes, like the petals of a flower. The first part of the intestine is white, and longitudinally plicated ; the rectum is dilated, and its coats are attenuated. Vascular system. — The vascular system re- sembles that of the Ascidiadcc, except that there is no heart. It consists of two sets of vessels, with four sets of capillaries; a circle in fact twice interrupted, once in the respira- tory sac, and again throughont the body. The branchial veins run along the transverse plaits of the sac, receiving secondary and ternary twigs at right angles. The primary branchial venous branches empty themselves on each side into the branchial trunk, which runs in the substance of the double cord which coasts the superior aspect of the sac. This double cord terminates in an abrupt manner anteri- orly near the oral orifice, and in a similar manner, but often becoming smaller near the orifice leading to the oesophagus. At this point the vein becomes an artery, and pro- bably sends back vessels to nourish the sac. It now runs along the oesophagus, supplying the stomach and intestine, and giving off in its course branches to the mantle. The veins arising from the arterial capillaries of the body meet near the commencement of the oesophagus in one trunk, which, passing along the inferior wall of the respiratory sac, oppo- site to the branchial vein, performs the func- tions of a branchial artery. It is interesting to observe here the differences between the modes in which the branches enter the branchial vein, and strike off from the bran- chial artery. In the former, just before the 4 k 4* 1240 TUNft branches enter the trunk, they give off a number of vessels, which enter a trunk along- side of the parent trunk, the combination forming a sort of delta ; in the latter, they leave the trunk singly, and send off their branches in a radiating direction. At a little distance from the trunks of both artery and vein, the secondary branches become parallel to one another and perpendicular to their primary branches, the more minute divisions following the same mode of ramification. Nervous system. — This system consists, as in other Tunicates, of a ganglion situated in the substance of the mantle, between the oral and anal orifices. It is globular, and sends off nervous twigs, firstly, to the respiratory orifice of the mantle ; secondly, to the respira- tory sac, where it begins to exhibit the trans- verse plates; and thirdly, to the anal orifice of the mantle. Generative system. — The generative organs consist of two elongated tubes, closed at one end, open at the other, and having a great number of close-set parallel cceca arranged at right angles, and opening into them along each side. These tubes are attached to the internal surface of the mantle ; their mouths are free for a short distance, and prominent the rest of their extent, and the attached cceca adherent. The orifices of these organs are situate at the junction of the first with the second quarter of the animal, and one third of the other end of each turns in towards its neighbour, and then proceeds forward parallel to itself. The branchial vein runs midway between the generative tubes above, and the branchial artery in a corresponding course below, so that the threads of the attachment of the plaits on the external surface of the sac are fixed into the tubes in a series on each side. From the details of the structure above given, it is evident that the Pelonaia is a true Tunicate. Its anatomy is important, and assists in the elucidation of the nature of the parts and organs in other members of the group. They present the positive anatomical character of a union of the mantle with the test ; so that there can be little question of their right to be regarded as members of a distinct family of Tunicata; and it is worthy of notice, says Prof. Forbes, that Mr. MacLeay, in his valuable remarks on the arrangement of the Tunicates (Linnsean Transact, vol. xiv.) had hypothetic-ally indicated such a group as this now constituted. Whilst in many of their characters they approach the true As- cidians, especially the unattached species of the genus Cynthia, in others they indicate a relationship with the cirrhograde Echinoder- mata. They differ from their Tunicate allies chiefly by their not being fixed, and by their form, which reminds one more of that of a Siphunculus than of an Ascidia ; indeed, they may be regarded as analogous to certain Siphuncididce ; and in that point of view the details of their form and structure are of much interest to the naturalist. They differ also, add Messrs. Forbes and Goodsir, from 3ATA. the Ascidians, more particularly in being bila- teral. The generative organs are symmetrical, and open one on each side of the anus, which is directed towards the ventral surface of the animal, in a line with the mouth and the nervous ganglion. The latter is thus proved to be an abdominal or subcesophageal ganglion, corresponding to or forming one of the chains of ganglia on the abdominal surface of the Articulata. In the same manner, the branchial artery or heart is proved to be the pulsating dorsal vessel, and the branchial vein the abdominal vessel (when that vessel exists) in the Annulosa. It is interesting also to perceive, that, co-existing with this decided approach to the annular type of form, we have the transverse plaits of the respiratory sac corresponding to the rings of an articu- lated animal. The disappearance of a separate test is also a departure from the plan of formation in the Ascidiadce and their allied groups, and an approach to other types of form, and more particularly to the cirrhograde Echinoderms, with certain of which Pelonaia has at least an analogical relation, in the water-filled body, and in the external form. Pelonaia, in fine, is one of those connecting genera so valuable as filling up gaps in the system, and supplying links in the chain of structures which runs through the series of organised bodies. Locomotion of Tunicata.— Generally speaking, the muscular tissue of the Ascidiadce, BotryllidcE, and Pclonaiadce is not subservient to the purposes of locomotion, and merely effects the sudden removal of water and noxious objects from the branchial sac. The entrance and exit of water through the ex- ternal orifices, constituting the chief sign of vitality in these apathetic creatures, are ge- nerally caused by the ciliary currents. But the water may be driven out by an ejaculatory effort of the constrictor muscles of the mantle ; which action would be followed by a more or less rapid expansion or dilata- tion of the mantle and test, effected by the elasticity of the latter. In such species as occasionally occur unattached, or even float- ing about freely, such an ejaculatory action would effect a transitory retrograde move- ment; but we have no evidence that any of the Ascidiadce or Pelonaiadcs make use of this propulsive agent in the manner of the Pyro- somata and the Salpte. Nearly all the Asci- diadce and BotryllidcE are sessile, but some few, mounted on flexible pedicles as Boltenia and Sigd/ina, may be said to enjoy a limited freedom of movement, necessary perhaps to their well being ; and the same may be said of such species as are attached to the floating branches of flexible algae and corallines. According to Mr. F. D. Bennett, except in the action of the sphincter-like membrane, surrounding the open extremity of the com- pound cylinder, there was but very slight evidence of motive power in the specimens of Pyrosoma examined by him. MM. Peron and Lesueur, however, describe a slight retrograde motion observable in this animal. TheTUNICATA. 1241 method in which this is brought about is not very clear ; it appears to be caused either by the synchronous contraction of the individual animals, causing a diminution in the general calibre of the cylinder, and thus effecting a faint ejaculation of water from the cavity of the latter; or by the posterior current of water from the anal orifice of each animal being synchron- ously ejected into the cavity of the cylinder, and thus giving a motive power to the whole. We have a more decided locomotion ex- hibited in the Satya, which is treated of by Mr. Bishop* as a " syringograde" animal, in the same category as "the Holothuria, and the larva? of those insects whose progression is effected by the alternate reception and expul- sion of water to and from their respiratory organs by an action similar to that of the syringe." In Salpa the dilatation of the test and its membranous lining causes the water necessary for respiration and nutrition to enter through the bilabiate posterior orifice, which has a valve preventing the return of the water by the same aperture \\ a trans- verse contraction of the body then expels the water through the anterior orifice, and the result is, that the animal is forced backwards, being carried in an inverse direction to that of the ejected water. J This retrograde motion * See art. Motion, Vol. III. p. 433. t See figure of Salpa cristata, showing most of the branchial muscles and the position of the valve (the latter is ideal, not being visible externally in the animal), fig. 228. p. 434. Vol. III. % In a communication from my friend Mr. Pittard on the subject of Syringograde movement, he re- marks as follows: " I am not aware that a true and satisfactory explanation has ever been given of the backward motion of bodies resulting from the ejec- tion out of them of jets or currents of fluid. That the action of such jets is at all comparable to the thrusting out of a solid body, or pole, against some resisting object, is by no means maintainable; for the property of rigidity, which is totally and in all circumstances absent in fluids, is an indispensable condition for the production of such a result. Nor is the action due to the resistance of the external medium in any other way, but solely to the hy- draulic pressure of the contained fluid on the in- ternal surface of the walls of the hollow body. It has been supposed that the resistance of the sur- rounding medium acts in some degree like, the walls of a cannon would in the following case: — If a bomb-shell, containing gunpowder, in the act of exploding, were placed in a cannon with the match- hole of the shell open and turned towards the breech, so that an explosive jet should be projected into the cavity of the cannon, the shell would be forced out with a much greater impetus than it would have if, cceteris paribus, it were in the open air. But this is not a parallel case, for here you have the resistance of the closed end of the cannon in one direction, and an open end, or no resistance, in the opposite direction; whereas, in the case under consideration, you have just the same re- sistance from the external medium in front of the body moved, as you have behind it; and whatever tendency to motion might result from such a re- sistance of the medium to the jet behind, just so much would there be resisting motion in front ; so that the effect would be neutralised, and no motion would result. The truth is, that from the two absolute laws of hydraulics, — that a fluid presses equally on all portions of the surface on which it acts, and that the direction of this pressure or has caused the posterior orifice to be regarded by some naturalists as the true oral orifice. The alternate action, of dilatation and contraction, have been observed to take place about fifteen times in a minute ; and have sometimes been termed the systole and the diastole. The contraction is effected rapidly, but the relax- ation, or rather the dilatation of the sub- elastic test, takes place but slowly. These movements are synchronous throughout a chain or group of Salpa. After all, this is but an imperfect amount of locomotion, and it is extremely probable that both the single Salpce and the Salpian wreaths and chains, the latter often several) ards in length, are, like the feebly moving Pyrosoma, the sport of wind and wave, wafting them hither and thither, either to bask calmly in the sunshine, or to be broken on the rocky shore. Affinities of the Tunicata. — Many of the early naturalists (as we have noticed in the first part of the article) noticed the analogies existing between the Ascidia and the Ostrea, Mytilus, and other Mo/lusca. The compound Ascidians, however, long remained grouped with Alcyortium, until Sa- vigny, Lesueur, and Desmarest pointed out their alliances with the simple Ascidians and with Molluscs. Lesueur also demonstrated the ascidian character of Pyrosoma, and re- moved it from the Radiata, amongst which it had been grouped ; and Cuvier pointed out the alliance of Sal]>a with Ascidia and Mollusca. Soon after the publication of the important zoological conclusions thus arrived at by his distinguished countrymen, Lamarck formed these animals into a new group, under the ap- pellation of Timiciers* (Tunicata), provision- ally placing them between the Radiata and Venues, and expressed strong doubt of their general alliance with the Mollusca. John Hunter, who perceived the relations force is at right angles to such surface, — it results that the force exerted by or through a fluid con- tained in a closed hollow body is exactly equal in opposite directions; that is to say, whatever may be its force impelling towards the right, by just so much does it impel towards the left ; however much it impels forwards, by just so much does it impel backwards; and so on for up and down, and all other opposite directions : so that the one exactly antagonises the other, and an equilibrium results. But remove a portion of the wall ; in other words, make a hole through which the fluid may escape, and then the pressure, in the direction of the side in which the hole is made, is minus, or less than the force in the opposite direction, by the size of the hole. The body, therefore, moves in the direction opposite to the hole, in obedience to the plus, or excess of hydraulic pressure in that direction." The Salpa, compressing the water in its interior, pro- duces a large amount of hydraulic force. Its pos- terior orifice being closed, it presents a hole or deficiency in the front only, and is impelled in the opposite direction. Also, during the act of taking in water behind, the animal moves likewise back- wards, for then there is, so to speak, an inversion of the process described above. The pressure of the external water, otherwise equal on all parts of its surface, is minus behind by the size of the posterior orifice, and therefore plus in front, again impelling it backwards. * Applied at first to the Botryllida only.1242 TUNICATA. subsisting between Ascidia and Salpa, and knew the true analogy of their exterior co- vering, proposed to distinguish them as a dis- tinct group of Molluscs, under the term " soft- shells," which more truly accords with their real nature than "shell-less" (Acephales sans coquilles), as they have been subsequently de- signated by Cuvier*, who also, together with Blainville, regarded them as acephalous Mol- luscs, and sufficiently distinct to form a sepa- rate class. In many of the Acephala we find two tubes for the ingress and egress water, like those of the Ascidia;, and the mantle closed throughout its length, the walls of its cavity lined with the branchiae, and the mouth at the base of this cavity. The Ascidia being immovable, has neither adductor nor foot-inuscles; for, being destitute of a locomotive organ and of valves, the muscles disappear, with the excep- tion of some sphincter-hke bands. Together ■with the muscles, the pedal nerve-ganglions, or rather suboesophageal or posterior ganglions are lost, and there remain only the buccal or supra-cesophageal ganglions. The differences between the heart and auricles of the Asci- dians and the other Molluscs are dependent on the modification of the branchiae ; the latter, in Ascidians, never being arranged in the four lamellae usually found in Molluscs. The digestive tube and the generative organs are essentially the same in Tunicata and Ace- phala, and in the latter, as in the former, the ovary and testicle are enclosed in the intes- tinal loops. Yet however much resemblance we may find between the Acephala and the Tunicata, there is still more between the latter and the Bryozoa. Van Beneden observes, that if a Bryozoon was confined to its cell, and still to carry on its respiratory function by its un- protruded tentacles, and if anastomosing com- munications were established between the tentacles and a heart at their base, we should have the complete idea of an Ascidian. There would be two external orifices, a single mouth situated at the base of the branchial sac, vibratile cilia throughout the extent of the anastomosing tentacles, a folded intestinal canal, a supra-cesophageal ganglion, some muscular bands, and organs of generation developed around the digestive tube. There would be only wanting to complete the animal, a cloaca to receive the excrements, the sperm, and the ova, and a direct passage of commu- nication between the respiratory and the cloacal cavities. The gemmiparous mode of reproduction observed in the Clavellinae, and BotryllidcB closely resembles that which ob- tains in the Bryozoa.

They have a dif- ferent form in the young and the adult states, and they undergo true metamorphoses. The same phenomena are seen in the Ascidians. These also have metamorphoses, perhaps, even more complete, but instead of vibratile cilia, the embryo is provided with a caudal appendage sufficiently long to serve for the purposes of locomotion ; which tail disappears, juot as the vibratile cilia of the former, as soon as the animal becomes definitely fixed." The embryogenic characters appear to en- tirely accord with the anatomical dispositions of these groups ; and altogether we are, per- haps, justified in considering, that they ap- proach on one side to the Acephala, and, through the Pedicellina\, they are, on the other hand, allied to the Bryozoa, forming a closely uniting link between these two impor- tant groups.

At first sight there is considerable resem- blance between many of these eystidean forms and the ascidian genus Boltenia, the body being globose or subcylindrical and pedun- culated. In the Cystidea there are two more or less terminal orifices, and a third lateral aperture. The whole animal is coated with hex- agonal plates variously ornamented ; the stem, perforated throughout and giving evidence of quinary arrangement. " The mouth," says Von Buch, " is planted in the central part of the upper surface, generally in a moveable proboscis, covered with minute plates ; the anal orifice is small, close to the mouth, per- forating a plate, not surrounded by separate valvules ; and the third aperture, probably the ovarial orifice of the animal, is placed further towards the middle, but almost inva- riably on the upper half of the body on which the mouth is placed. It is round or oval in form, not connected with the mouth, and often covered by a five or six-sided pyramid, which seems to be composed of as many little valves." We have introduced this description that we may here point out the general similarity of the external form of these obsolete radiate animals to some of the ascidian group, and that vie may in particular point out the very similar armature of ornamented hexagonal plates present in Chelyosoma, with its valve- surrounded orifices. With regard to the ad- ditional orifices, we have but to lengthen out the oviduct or efferent vessel of the Ascidia, and continue it to the surface, as in the mal- formation noticed and drawn by John Hunter, and a very similar arrangement of parts will apparently exist. There are several points of analogy between some forms of Ascidia; and of Zoophyta asci- doida (Bowcrbanhia, &c.) and the Radiata: into this subject we must not now enter ; we can only allude to the observations of Messrs. Forbes and Goodsir on the Pelunaia (see p. 1239.), and leave the subject open to further investigation.

Urethre.~) In the Male.—The urethra, or uro-sexiial canal, is the canal by which the urine,the secre- tion of the testes, of the prostate and Cowper's glands, with that of the vesiculae seminales.are discharged. It commences at the opening in the anterior part of the neck of the bladder, and terminates at the extremity of the glans penis. In the beginning of its course it tra- verses the prostate gland ; it then perforates the triangular ligament, which is stretched across beneath the arch of the pubis ; and after passing through this it enters the groove between and beneath the corpora cavernosa penis, and is now surrounded by the corpus spongiosum urethrae; and passing through the glands, an expansion of the latter body, it ends in a slit-like orifice, the meatus urinarius. Direction. — The direction of the canal varies according to the state of the penis : thus in the relaxed condition of this organ it presents curves like the italic Co procum- bent ; if we trace it backwards from the meatus, it will be seen to rise towards the pubis ; thence it descends slightly, and passes beneath the arch of that bone, after which it makes a gentle curve upwards to the neck of the bladder. When the penis is erect, the urethra is straight for at least three-fourths of its course, that is, whilst it traverses the spongy body; after which it makes a rather abrupt curve towards the opening into the bladder. In the introduction of the catheter, the surgeon, by drawing the penis forwards and upwards, straightens the anterior three-fourths of the canal, thus approximating its direction to that which it assumes in the erect state of the penis; and now, by careful manipulation, in depressing the handle of the instrument be- tween the thighs, to a level with the urethral opening in the triangular ligament, he can, without any difficulty, succeed in passing even a straight catheter into the bladder. It is important to remark that the anterior three-fourths of the urethra are loose and pendulous, whilst the remainder is fixed to the pubis in a manner presently to be de- scribed; a circumstance to be borne in mind in catheterisation. The urethra is divided by anatomists into three parts, each presenting characteristic peculiarities. Thus the first part is termed the prostatic portion, because it is surrounded by the prostate gland; the second is de- nominated the membranous portion, because, when deprived of its surrounding structures, it is little more than a simple membrane ; it is also called the muscular part, because it is encircled by muscular fibres ; and the last, being entirely invested by the corpus spon- giosum, is designated the spongy portion. According to a rough measurement, it may be stated that the spongy portion occupies about seven parts, the membranous rather less than one part, and the prostatic rather more than one part of the entire length of the tube. Length. — The urethra has been frequently measured to ascertain its length and diameter; and much attention has been devoted to this subject by various observers, with the view to the treatment of strictures and other diseases incidental to this canal. It need scarcely be remarked that the urethra varies at different periods of life, according to the evolution of the generative organs; and hence it is much shorter in the child than in the adult, and it is well known frequently to undergo a marked elongation in old persons, in consequence of hypertrophy of the pro- state gland. I shall here introduce the measurements in length, as given us by some practical surgeons, whose attention has been especially directed to this subject, observing that the length of the urethra is expressed by the extent to which it can be stretched, by drawing the penis somewhat forcibly forward. According to Ducarp, it rarely exceeds nine inches in length. Whately examined the urethra in forty-eight subjects of different heights : these he arranged under three heads, viz. tall, middling, and short. In 16 subjects of tall stature, the urethra measured In 1 subject, 9 inches 6 lines. 8 „ 9 inches. 2 „ 8 inches. 5 „ 8 inches 6 lines. In 23 of medium stature, it measured In 3 subjects, 9 inches. 1 „ 8 inches 9 lines. 7 „ 8 inches 6 lines. 2 „ 8 inches 3 lines. 1 „ 7 inches 6 lines. Whilst in 9 of short statute, it measured In 1 subject, 8 inches 9 lines. 2 „ 8 inches 6 lines. 4 „ 8 inches. 2 „ 7 inches 9 lines. The collective average is therefore nearly 8i- inches, and the respective averages would stand thus: — For those of tall stature, it would be 8in. 91. For those of middling stature - 8in. 21. For those of short stature - - Sin. 31. Lisfranc examined the urethra in twelve adults, and he found its length to vary from 9 to 10 inches. In a negro it measured 12 inches. M. Petrequin has collected the various measurements of the canal, as given by the French writers on this subject, by which it appears that the estimated length varies from 5\ inches to 12 inches. Petrequin con- ducted his own examinations with both straight and curved instruments. With the straight instrument he found the length of the urethra between 5f and inches, whilst with a curved instrument it measured from 6^ to 7 inches. The difference he explains by the fact, that, inasmuch as the urethra is not recti- linear, a straight instrument cannot be passed through it without effacing the angle betweenURETHRA. 1215 the bulbous and membranous portions of the canal.* Mr. Briggs observing that most of his pre- decessors had examined the length of the urethra after death, made a series of examina- tions of the canal in the living subject; and he adopted the following mode of examina- tion :— He introduced into the bladder a ca- theter without a stilet, on the stem of which was marked a graduated scale of inches and fractional parts, measured from the eye of the instrument. He observes, "as soon as the urine begins to flow from the catheter, which has only one eye, the line marked on the stem corresponding with the external meatus will necessarily indicate the exact length of the canal, or the distance from the meatus to its termination in the bladder. Of sixty persons in whom the urethra was measured thus, the length was found to vary from 6f to 8J inches. In eight instances, or rather less than one- seventh of the whole (twenty of them being persons of short stature, or not exceeding 5 feet 4 inches in height), the length of the urethra was found to be under 7 inches. In forty-five instances, or three-fourths of the numher, i. e. in persons of middle stature, the measurement was found to be between 7 and 8 inches, and in a few it exceeded 8. In some instances of very corpulent subjects, at an advanced age, the urethra was found to be 10 inches in length." He considers the average length of the passage to be 71 or 7f inches, the external parts being in a natural condition, neither hanging in a loose, flabhy state, nor unusually retracted. Briggs found the pro- portions of the various parts of the canal to stand relatively thus : — from the orifice to the membranous part, 6A inches; from thence to the bladder, If inch = 8^ inches. As there was no stretching of the penis in the examina- tions thus made, it is easy to reconcile the discrepancies between Briggs's and Whately's measurements. Of the relative length of the different por- tions of the canal, M.Petrequin cites the fol- lowing authorities : — The prostatic portion measures, according to Boyer, 1.5 or 16 lines ; Littre, 1.5 lines; Ducamp and Blandin, from 12 to 15; Senn, 13; J. Cloquet, 15. M. Petrequin agrees with Lisfranc, that the most exact measurement is from 8 to 11 lines. Boyer estimates the length of the mem- branous portion at 12 lines; Ducamp, from 9 to 12; Blandin, at 10; Lisfranc, from 7 to 11. M. Petrequin has found it to vary from 6 to 9 lines, when measured by its central axis ; its upper surface measuring from 8 to 10 lines, its under surface from 4 to 5 and sometimes 6, the difference arising from the projection of the bulb beneath. The mean length of the prostatic and membranous portions taken to- gether is, according to Malgaigne, 13 lines, but it varies from 11 to 15 lines. Petrequin * See the review of M. Petrequin's work ( Traite cTAnatomie Medico-cliirurgique, §"c), in the British and Foreigu Medical Review, vol. xx. p. 136. has found it to vary from 14 to 18 and some- times 20. As to the bulbous and pendulous portions of the urethra, their rectilinear mea- surement is 6 inches or G inches and 10 lines, and the curvilinear 5 inches or 5 inches and 4 lines.* Diameter. — In diameter, also, the urethra varies according to age: thus in the young sub- ject it is small; indeed its diameter increases in proportion to the age of the individual; and in the aged, partly in consequence of the flac- cidity of the parts surrounding it, partly from the loss of contractility in its own tissue, its capacity becomes immensely increased, so that it will readily admit a catheter of half- an-inch bore, and the escape of fragments of stone of equal size. Even in the infant, however, the urethra is more capacious than is generally imagined, and will admit a much larger sound than we should a priori suppose ; a fact of no small im- portance in sounding at this early period of life. When the penis is erect, the urethra is diminished in diameter, from the pressure of the turgid veins of the spongy body, and from the increased distension of its own blood- vessels. To ascertain the diameter of the urethra, and to compare it in persons of different ages, Sir E. Home examined the canal in two persons — one of the age of 80, and the other 30. At 80. At 30. At 9 lines from the meatus it measured - - - 5 lines 44 lines. At 4 inches 3 lines from ditto 4 4 At 6 inches from the meatus (at the bulb) - 7 7i At 7 inches (beginning of membranous part) - - 4 2f At 7 inches 9 lines (near the prostate) - - - 5 4 At 8 inches (beginning of the prostatic part) - 4 3\ At 8 inches 3 lines (the middle of ditto) - - 6 51 At 8i inches (near the neck of the bladder) - - 5 4J- Briggs directed his attention to the dia- meter of the urethra in the various parts of its course, and he found the dimensions ma- terially altered if the urethra be injected with wax or any other substance; and the result of his examination throws considerable doubt on the conclusions of Sir Everard Home. From the casts which he made he failed to discover any sudden narrowing or constric- tion at the termination of the membranous part of the urethra, or any resemblance in the shape of the curve as represented in Home's plates.f Briggs remarks, " The portion of the urethra which extends from the apex of the prostate * Ibid. t From examinations I have made myself of wax casts of the urethra, I believe the representations of Home not to be exaggerated.1246 URETHRA. forwards to a short distance beyond the arch of the pubis, and in the natural state is the narrowest part of it, when distended, greatly exceeds the rest of the canal in its dimensions, and forms a large oblong sinus from 11 to If of an inch in length ; and in its transverse dia- meter at its broadest part, from Jgths to |-g-ths of an inch, the part of the urethra anterior to it not exceeding 27otns °f an inch. The broadest part of this sinus lies directly under the arch of the symphysis pubis. The narrow part of the canal, as seen in these injections, is at the point of union between the prostatic and membranous portions." The irregularities in the form of the urethra here noticed do not appear to exist at the earlier periods of life. In a cast of the urethra of a boy 11 years old, made by injecting wax, no inequalities such as those mentioned above in the adult were observable throughout its coarse, the diameter of the cast, which is nearly cylindrical, measuring pretty uniformly ith of an inch. Briggs found the curve of the urethra to commence li inch anterior to the bulb; and from this point to its termination in the bladder, to form an arc of a circle of 3^ inches in diameter, the chord of the arc being 2J inches, or rather less than one third of the circumference. In another cast the chord of the segment was found to measure 2T8^ inches of a circle of 3^ inches in diameter, the inclination of the internal orifice, or en- trance into the bladder, forming an obtuse angle with the general course of the urethra. The same surgeon remarks, that in young subjects the posterior portion rises nearly at right angles from the rest of the canal, and consequently makes a much sharper bend ; and that this ascending portion is com- paratively longer than in the adult, as was observed by Camper, who justly attributes the circumstances to the higher position of the bladder in early age. A similar remark was made by Bichat; and the fact is well known to the lithotomist, who, in directing the cutting instrument into the bladder of the child, raises the point by depressing the handle at this important stage of the operation. According to Briggs, the most depending part of the curve is at the point where the membranous portion would be intersected by a line drawn through the longitudinal axis of the symphysis pubis to the anus: this would divide the membranous part into two equal parts, and pass through the most dilated part of this portion of the canal * I shall now pursue the description of the canal, commencing at that part which leads immediately from the bladder, namely the pro- static portion, observing that this, together witl) the membranous part, is contained almost •wholly within the pelvis, and the two con- stitute therefore the pelvic portion of the urethra, and form the true representative of the female urethra. * Briggs, on the Treatment of Strictures of the Urethra by Mechanical Dilatation. The prostatic jmrtion traverses the prostate gland at the distance of about two lines from the anterior, four from the posterior, and seven from the lateral surface of the gland. In this respect, however, it varies considerably: thus, in some cases, it is very close to the posterior surface, especially where the isthmus of the prostate is imperfectly developed.* The prostatic portion is from 12 to 15 lines in length, and it commences at the neck of the bladder by a round opening, which is slightly raised ; it then expands to the width of 4 or 5 lines, and gradually contracts itself into the membranous portion. It varies in length and direction in different subjects, and differs materially in these respects ac- cording to age. Lisfranc examined it in eight healthy subjects, and found the diameter of the anterior and posterior portions to vary from 3 to 4 lines, whilst the middle portion measured from 4 to 5^ lines. Although closely invested by the dense tissue of the prostate and its capsule, this is nevertheless the most dilatable part of the whole urethra, and will readily admit the introduction of the fore-finger. The levatores prostates muscles, together with the jmbo- prosiatic ligaments, support it, and attach it to the pubis, and it is compressed by the levatores ani. The general direction of this division of the canal is obliquely downwards ; it pre- sents a slight concavity (the prostatic sinus) at its floor, where it is traversed bythe caput gallinaginis, which, running from behind for- wards, divides the sinus into two equal parts. In the prostatic sinus the ducts of the prostate open, assuming a crescentic arrangement around the base of the caput gallinaginis, whilst the vasa ejaculatoria terminate usually on the side of the latter body. The description of the urethral orifice of the bladder belongs to the anatomy of this viscus, and to the article Bladder the reader is referred ; but it is requisite here slightly to allude to it, as it bears materially upon the general direction of this part of the urethra. When viewed from before backwards, the opening will be generally found somewhat raised, so that the floor of the urethra forms a slight depression; and this depression is materially increased in hypertrophy of the prostate, a circumstance always to be remem- bered in the introduction of the catheter in such cases. In infancy the direction of the prostatic part is very different from what it is in after life. In consequence of the bladder at this early period being situated higher up, that is, more in the abdomen, the urethra at this part rises more vertically, and thus forms an angle with the membranous portion; hence, as in the aged, the necessity, in passing a sound or ca- theter, to depress the handle to a considerable extent, and thus to raise the point of the in- strument. As the prostate becomes evolved, * Lisfranc mentions an instance where the isth- mus was wholly wanting, and the urethra formed a remarkable pouch at this part.URETHRA. 1247 the prostatic part of the urethra gradually de- scends, until its general direction is more con- tinuous with that of the membranous part. 1 shall defer the description of the caput gal- linaginis until I come to that of the general surface of the urethra. The connection of the urethra to the pro- state is very close, the ducts of the gland passing directly into it ; it is therefore im- possible to raise it from its attachment without division of the prostatic ducts. When a ca- theter is introduced, the course of the canal invested by the prostate can be indistinctly traced by the finger introduced into the rectum. The membranous portion (pais muscularis, isthmus urethra) commences from the anterior part of the prostate, and extends beneath the arch of the pubis as far as the bulb : it is included between the prostatic and spongy portions, and is covered slightly at its anterior and under part by the bulb, so that it is really shorter below than above. It makes a slight curve, the concavity facing upwards. The concavity is at the distance of nearly an inch from the interpubic substance ; the con- vexity looks towards the perinaeum. Be- tween it and the pubis, and just beneath the pubic arch, the dorsal veins of the penis run. Proceeding from the anterior extremity of the prostate, the membranous portion of the urethra traverses the triangular ligament, which splits into two lamellae : one passing backwards over the prostate, is continuous with the capsule of the gland, the other ad- vances forwards over the bulb, and blends with the tendinous investment of the spongy body. The opening through which the ure- thra passes is round. The membranous por- tion forms the segment of a circle, whose radius is, according to Krause, 2^ lines. This part of the canal has been termed membran- ous, from the idea that it represented a simple membrane when deprived of its surrounding muscular structure, and that it was wholly destitute of any investment of the spongy body. This, however, is not correct ; there is a thin layer of vascular tissue, continuous in front with the spongy body, and closely sur- rounding the mucous membrane of this part of the urethra, between it and its muscular layers. The vessels of this extension of the spongy body pass backwards, to terminate in the plexus surrounding the neck of the blad- der : this is mixed up with elastic tissue, and constitutes a truly erectile tissue. An exten- sion of the same structure enters into the for- mation of the caput gallinaginis. Between the layers of the triangular liga- ment, and in close connection with the mem- branous part of the urethra, are found three sets of muscular fibres {musculas urethralis) : they consist of the two pairs of muscles de- scribed, one by Wilson and the other by Guthrie ; and the circular fibres of Santorini, which closely surround the urethra. The anteprostate, or Cowper's glands, covered by the inferior stratum of the compressor urethras, are placed beneath this part, and the arteries of the bulb are in close approximation to it, running beneath and on either side of it. The floor of the membranous portion is traversed longitudinally in the median line by the pointed end of the caput gallinaginis. If a catheter be passed into the bladder, the membranous portion can be distinguished by the finger introduced into the rectum and drawn forwards, there being only a small quan- tity of cellular membrane interposed between the under part of its muscular investment and the intestine. Boyer estimated the length of the mem- branous portion at about 1 inch ; Ducamp from 9 to 10 lines ; Lisfranc found it in twelve subjects to vary from 7 to 11 lines. In these its anterior diameter varied from 3\ to 4£ lines, its posterior from 4-| too lines, and just behind the bulb it measured at least 1T', line less than in any other part. It is universally admitted that the point of junction between the membranous and spongy portions is the narrowest part of the urethra, with the excep- tion of the meatus. The membranous part of the urethra is sur- rounded by muscular fibres, which have been variously described by different anatomical writers. Thus Santorini, as early as 1724, in his Observationes Anatomicm, pointed out some transverse fibres as encircling the urethra at this part: he terms them " the elevator or eja- culator urethras," and describes them as being inserted into the lower part of the urethra. Mr. Wilson, in the year 1808, gave a descrip- tion of two muscles surrounding the mem- branous part of the urethra, the origin of which is from a tendon attached to the pos- terior part of the symphysis pubis, a little above its lower border: the muscle thus arising from a single origin then descends, and divides into two portions, which, reaching the mem- branous portion of the urethra, spread them- selves out by its side, and are implanted into a common tendon below it. The muscle is termed by Wilson the compressor urethrae. In 1834, Mr. Guthrie, in his lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons, demonstrated another series of muscular fibres, as sur- rounding the membranous portion of the urethra, and of which he considers Wilson's muscle as a part. That portion described by Guthrie, and now known by his name, arises by a thin tendon on either side, from the ra- mus of the ischium, and, passing transversely, splits into two portions, one above and the other below the urethra; the two muscles are connected together above by a mesial tendon, which, passing forwards, is inserted in part into the upper part of the urethra, whilst another portion, passing backwards, is im- planted into the upper surface of the front of the prostate. The under portion of the muscle is also connected with its fellow by a similar mesiaii tendon, which, advancing forwards, goes to the central tendon of the perinaeum, and, sending a slip backwards, is inserted into the under part ol the prostate. The muscles are included between the two layers of the triangular ligament; and the1248 URETHRA. effect of this muscular apparatus must be to support and compress this part of the urethra, and to prevent any retrogression of the seminal fluid in the venereal act. The urethra now enters the corpus spongi- osum, by which it is surrounded, until its ter- mination at the extremity of the glans penis. The spongy body surrounds the urethra equally, except at the bulb and at the glands : in the former situation there is a much thicker layer below than above, which gives to the bulb an appearance of great dilatation, whilst at the glans there is but very little of this structure at the under part. The bulb and the glans, both dilatations of the spongy body, bear a tolerably constant relation to each other. This part of the canal is called the spongy portion; it has already been stated that its length varies in different subjects, and accord- ing to the condition of the penis, being 4 or 5 inches in the flaccid state, and 6 or 8 inches in the erect condition of the organ. It com- mences at the termination of the membranous portion, and is lodged in a groove between and beneath the corpora cavernosa penis, forming, with its investing corpus spongiosum, a convexity, projecting beyond the general circumference of the penis. The direction of the spongy portion is curved ; it passes upwards in front of the lower part of the symphysis pubis as high as the suspended part of the penis; and then taking the direction of this organ, it bends downwards, thus forming an abrupt curve : by simple traction of the penis forwards and upwards, it can be rendered perfectly straight. If the spongy part of the canal be laid open longitudinally, it is found to be plicated, the folds running from behind forwards, and dovetailing with one another when the urethra is closed. This plicated arrangement of the mucous membrane of the spongy portion was observed by Bichat and others, and is due to the contraction of the submucous tis- sue : if the urethra be immersed in alcohol and examined with the aid of a simple lens, an arborescent arrangement of the folds is visible at the anterior part of the canal, in appearance not unlike the plicae in the mu- cous membrane of the cervix uteri. The spongy portion varies in diameter in different parts; thus, dilated at its commence- ment in the bulb, it gradually tapers until it reaches the glans, when it suddenly expands into the fossa naviculars, to be again con- tracted at the meatus. The bulb (pars bulbosa urethra et pars sub- pubica) is the widest part of the spongy por- tion. Lisfranc found in twelve subjects it varied in diameter from 5 to 7 lines. Home and most anatomists who have examined the urethra, have come to the general conclu- sion that the bulbous portion presents a de- cided dilatation, and a simple examination of the part would lead to a similar conclusion. I cannot, therefore, conceive why there should be any doubt on the subject. Injections of wax prove to my mind an undoubted dilata- tion of the bulbous part; Krause and Guthrie, however, deny that any such exists. Kobelt has shown, that if the bulb be in- jected, the corpus spongiosum at this part presents two lateral hemispherical swellings, separated from each other in the middle line by a longitudinal depression. " This is caused by a septum which divides the posterior part of the bulb into two lateral symmetrical halves; but anteriorly it is gradually lost. The two portions of which it indicates that the bulb is composed, are the analogues of the com- pletely divided portions of the bulb and corpus spongiosum in the whole of the marsupial tribe."* " In the middle of the bulb there is a slight superficial elevation (co/liculus bulbi medius), which is situated above and between them, but does not extend so far backwards as they do, and gives passage to the mem- branous part of the urethra, the vessels and nerves of the bulb, and the ducts of Cowper's glands." f The extremity of the caput gallinaginis sometimes reaches the bulbous portion, and the ducts of Cowper's glands terminate in its floor by two minute orifices, extremely dif- ficult to find. This part of the canal extends for about the fourth part of an inch or less, the anterior layer of the deep perinaeal fascia covers it underneath, and it is completely in- vested by the acceleratores urina?. The remainder of the spongy portion is united to the bulbous at an angle of 45 in the flaccid state of the penis ; but when this organ is erect, this part of the canal is rendered perfectly straight : it terminates at the meatus urinarius. The extremity of the spongy portion is called the glandular part (pars glandularis), being surrounded by the glans penis. When the urethra has entered the glands, it dilates into a fossa from 4 to 6 lines in length, this is termed the fossa navicularis Morgagnii. When cut transversely, it has the appearance of a longitudinal fissure. The urethra is sur- rounded unequally by the glans penis; the floor of the navicular fossa is covered by a very thin layer of this extension of the spongy body, whilst its sides and upper surface have a considerable investment from the glans. The urethra having traversed the corpus spongiosum and the glands, terminates at the anterior and inferior part of this body, by a small slit-like orifice of two or three lines, the long axis of which is vertical: from this a small fold of membrane passes down to join the prepuce, and is termed the frccnum prcc- putii. The effect of this latter is, when the penis is erect, to draw down the opening of the urethra, and thus to narrow the orifice, and direct the contents of the urethra down- wards and forwards. The two sides of the meatus urinarius are kept in apposition by the projection of the glans, and they are joined below by a delicate fold of mucous * British and Foreign Quarter!}7 Review, vol. xix. p. 508. f Ibid.1219 URETHRA. membrane, not unlike the fourchctte of the female labia. The urethral orifice is surrounded, accord- ing to Guthrie*, by a peculiar dense struc- ture, which he considers analogous to that which forms the edge of the eyelid, and which he believes to be requisite to maintain the patency of the opening ; for if this be de- stroyed by ulceration, the part from which it has been removed contracts, and the opening becomes so small, as to give rise to a most troublesome form of stricture. The opening of the urethra is almost invariably the nar- rowest part of the canal; and hence, if an instrument has been introduced through this, it will with facility traverse the remainder of the passage, unless there be some mechanical impediment from spasm or disease; and hence a trifling diviMon of this part will permit the passage of a large instrument, and tin: escape of fragments of stone, which are frequently arrested here after the operation of lithotrity. It is but sparingly elastic. After immersion in alcohol, the mucous membrane at the meatus urinarius will be found arranged in circular folds. In briefly reviewing the condition of the urethra as connected with the structures in- vesting it, we observe that the prostatic por- tion, being surrounded by a body possessing considerably dilatability, remains under almost every condition passive and yielding; and hence it happens that a catheter, having reached this part of the canal, must, if its point be properly directed, enter tiie bladder, unless there be some enlargement of the prostate itself; and hence the inference that no force is to be employed in passing the catheter under these circumstances. On the contrary, the membranous portion of the urethra is a part of high irritability. This depends partly on the nature of the tissue itself, but mainly on the muscular apparatus connected with it. This part of the canal is most liable to irritation and spasm from general anil local causes ; and is well known to be the most frequent seat of stricture. The remainder of the urethra is entirely sur- rounded by the corpus spongiosum, anil must necessarily be influenced by the condition of that body. When the latter is distended, as in erection, the diameter of the urethra must be proportionally diminished ; and, in the undis- tended state of the former, it assumes its greatest degree of dilatability. Consequently, in the introduction of the catheter, the chief difficulty, even independent of organic disease, is experienced at the meatus, or at the angle formed at the junction of the bulb and anterior part of the spongy portion, or at the mem- branous part, the remainder of the spongy por- tion in the healthy state seldom offering any resistance to the progress of the instrument. It will also be further remarked, that the dorsal surface of the urethra is smooth and even throughout, except in the situation of the lacuna magna, whilst its depressions and eleva- * Lectures on Diseases of the Bladder and Urethra. VOL. IV. tions are found upon the floor of the canal, and hence the importance in catheterisation of keeping the beak of the instrument against the superior part of the urethra. Mucous Membrane. — The urethra is es- sentially a mucous canal, forming an important part of the genito-urinary mucous system. It is continuous with the mucous mem- brane of the bladder, and blends at the meatus with the cutaneous covering of the glans penis. There is always a distinct line of de- marcation at this part, the urethral surface being moistened by a mucous secretion. When laid open, it can be frequently seen to present two distinct white lines, one at the upper, and the other at the under surface, running longi- tudinally ; these are supposed to indicate the original lateral division of the canal. Inde- pendent of this, the mucous membrane will be generally found arranged in longitudinal folds, with furrows between them. The folds vary in depth and breadth, the larger are found on the under surface, and they are more numerous in this situation than above. They commence at the bulb and run forwards, sometimes continuing of the same size through- out, frequently tapering and sending off as they approach the extremity of the penis, delicate processes, which present a somew hat arborescent arrangement, not unlike that pre- sented by the lining membrane of the uterus ; many on the dorsal aspect will be seen to terminate on either side of the lacuna magna. The folds of the urethra, which are not al- ways visible after death, result from the con- traction of the submucous layer, and are so arranged, that, when the two surfaces are in ap- position, especially if the vessels of the urethra be injected, a sort of dovetailing of the mucous membrane occurs, bearing a slight resemblance to the plicated arrangement of the oesophagus of the whale. The urethra after death is whitish in colour, and in some parts so transparent as to permit the veins of the corpus spongiosum to be seen through it. Its bloodvessels are readily in jected, when the whole canal presents a beau- tiful vermilion tint. At the membranous por- tion, Shaw has described a considerable plexus of veins beneath the mucous membrane of the urethra: these veins are spread all over the canal, but are accumulated at the membranous part, lying one over the other in its long axis, so as to form two distinct columns with a groove between them : they unite and sur- round the sinus pocularis. Wilson had ob- served this arrangement of vessels, before Shaw published his description of them. These veins communicate with the plexus surrounding the prostate and neck of the bladder. They are best seen by inserting a tube beneath the mucous membrane, and in- jecting them with mercury. Shaw supposes them capable of considerable distension, and thus of producing a species of erection of this part of the tube.* In rude attempts to pass a catheter, the vessels of this part are often * Medico-chirurg. Trans, vol. x. 4 L1250 URETHRA. lacerated, and pour out a large quantity of blood. They have no communication with the veins of the corpus spongiosum itself, properly so called. The colour of the mucous membrane de- pends on the degreee of vascularity in dif- ferent parts. Thus, at the meatus, it is of a pink aspect, becoming gradually pale towards the bladder. But in the membranous por- tion, owing to congestion in the veins, it is very frequently much darker, as these vessels are readily distinguishable through the mem- brane, whilst in the prostatic part it is white. The colour of the mucous membrane is much heightened under inflammation: this is espe- cially visible in the fossa naviculars, and at the orifice in severe attacks of gonorrhoea; and the same has been witnessed in other parts of the canal after division of the urethra, during an attack of gonorrhoea. Under in- flammation it loses its smooth, polished aspect, and presents a velvety appearance. Mr. Quekett has lately made some beautiful injections of the vessels of the mucous mem- brane of the urethra, in which it is seen that, in the bulbous portion, the bloodvessels run- ning in the valleculas between the columns are larger and more numerous than those of the columns themselves; whilst nearer the meatus, where the columns are either small or alto- gether absent, the membrane is not unfre- quently provided with villi, which resemble those of the lips and extremities of the fingers and toes in having each a single looped capil- lary. Lacunce. — The whole of the urethra, ex- cept the prostatic portion, is marked by minute openings, distinctly perceptible at the upper and under surface, but they are certainly larger and more numerous on the upper. They are the openings of the lacunce or mucous glands, whose office it is to secrete a bland fluid for the lubrication of the canal, and thus to facili- tate the onward progress of the contents of the urethra. The lacunae vary in different individuals in size and number: some anato- mists believe them to be more numerous in the membranous portion : my own observa- tions would lead me to the conclusion, that the greater number are to be found in the spongy portion. They are termed indiscrimi- nately the glands of Littre and Morgagni, or the orifices are called the lacunas of Morgacni, whilst the crypts opening into them are termed glands of Littre. The lacuna? vary in depth : in some situations they admit the passage of bristles, to the depth of two or three lines; in others they are by no means so deep, whilst in other cases they are scarcely perceptible. Their orifices face for the most part obliquely forwards towards the meatus, but now and then they pass vertically to the surface; they are found between and upon the columns of the urethra. A simple examination of the lacunae would represent them as mere in- flexions of the mucous membrane of the urethra, and many of the smaller ones are of this nature : some, however, present a cellular appearance, but this seems to arise from the anastomosis of vessels distributed on them: they are lined with%pithelium of a character similar to that lining the urethral membrane generally, and a considerable plexus of vessels is distributed around them. Under inflamma- tion they pour out a copious secretion, and are not unfrequently the seat of special disease. The use of the lacuna? is to extend the secret- ing surface of the mucous membrane of the urethra, in situations where any glandular ap- paratus would have been obviously incon- venient. In old cases of stricture, and other diseases of the canal, they become exceedingly enlarged. The lacuna magna. — Near the termina- tion of the urethra, and within a few lines of the meatus urinarius, will be seen an inflexion of the urethral membrane, forming a cul-de-sac, into which the blunt end of a probe can be passed : this is denominated the lacuna magna, being in structure and function analogous to the other lacunae of the urethra. The lacuna magna is a point in the anatomy of the urethra of some practical import, inasmuch as it is likely to arrest the entrance of a catheter, and to convey to the ignorant an erroneous idea of stricture. It varies in situation in different individuals. It is usually placed at about one-third of an inch from the meatus on the dorsal aspect of the fossa navicularis, so that, on separating the lips of the meatus, it can be brought into view; but it is occa- sionally further back, and now and then is placed on the under surface, and in many cases I have in vain tried to find it. I believe it is occasionally altogether absent. It will be found, where the columns of the urethra are developed, that they take their course towards the lacuna, and, on reaching it, pass off' in slender processes to the meatus. In an urethra which I recently examined, I found a lacuna magna of considerable size in the under surface of the urethra, behind the middle of the spongy body. Into this the point of a catheter could be readily passed, and it might have been easily mistaken for stricture. Hunter, and most of his successors, believe the matter of gonorrhoea to be incubated in the lacuna magna. Structure. — The urethral membrane is divi- sible into two distinct layers. The inner, which is analogous to other mucous surfaces, consists of a basement membrane covered throughout by epithelium. This, according to Quain and Sharpey, for the most part, is of the scaly character, but in the vicinity of the bladder it is spheroidal. Henle describes the fossa navicularis as covered with small flat and roundish scales, whilst the remaining part of the urethra is covered with a single series of prismatic particles.* Beneath the mucous membrane there is a layer composed of a tissue or structure of a mixed character, containing some contractile fibres, supposed to be muscular, blended with elastic tissue. It is connected to the delicate tendinous covering of the corpus spongiosum, and is supported by transverse tendinous bands distinctly visible beneath it. This layer * See article Mucous Membrane.1-251 URETHRA. 4 l 2 varies in depth in different parts, and is thicker in the membranous than in other parts of the urethra. When examined with the micro- scope, it presents abundant evidence of the existence of contractile fibre mixed with com- mon elastic tissue. The relative quantity of these elements varies according to situation : thus, in the membranous portion, there is less of the contractile tissue than in the spongy portion ; a circumstance of some interest, as, this part being surrounded by a distinct mus- cular covering, there would be less necessity for it than in other situations where muscle is absent. The bloodvessels from the spongy body shoot through it. This contractile tissue is identical with that recently described by Kolliker as entering into the structure of the spleen and mucous canals, which have an evidently contractile power. The existence of this layer has been long recognised, and the attention of anatomists was directed specially to it by Sir E. Home, who believed it to be muscular; and his opinion was supported by the observations of Mr. Wilson, who attributes the resist- ance occasionally, in irritable states of the urethra, offered to the introduction of the catheter, and the expulsion of bougies in like conditions, to spasm of these supposed mus- cular fibres. This idea, however, was opposed by Sir Charles Bell; but the dispute is de- prived of its interest since the discovery by Kolliker of the true nature of this peculiar tissue, which combines to a certain extent the attributes of organic muscular fibre and elastic tissue. This layer varies in depth in different subjects, and is generally highly developed in the robust and muscular, so as in some in- dividuals to grasp with considerable firmness a bougie when introduced into the canal. Wilson mentions an instance of a gentleman who could "as distinctly feel a contraction of the passage coming on, and taking place at one part, as he could feel any muscle act." The use of this layer must necessarily be to regulate the force of the current of fluids through the urethra. According to Kolliker the following is the arrangement of the submucous layer in various parts of the urethra. It is termed by him the simple muscular tissue. " Its relations are most complicated in the prostate gland, and the prostatic portion of the urethra, which is rich in muscular fibres. So large is the quantity of this tissue in the gland itself, that the true glandular structure constitutes scarcely one third or one fourth of the whole. On removing the mucous membrane from the prostatic portion of the urethra, the yellow longitudinal fibres of the caput gallinaginis come first into view, which form the lower end of the trigone, and contain very few mus- cular fibres. On both sides of the caput gal- linaginis, and extending to the anterior wall of the urethra, similar yellowish longitudinal fibres present themselves, and form a strong layer towards the neck of the bladder; but towards the membranous part of the urethra they gradually decrease to a very delicate layer. This longitudinal fibrous layer of the prostatic part is connected, internally to the sphincter vesicae, by a thin and indistinct layer of fibres with some of the longitudinal mus- cular fibres of the bladder; but by far the greater part of it is unconnected with this latter : it consists of half fibro-cellular tissue with many nucleus-fibres, and half of evident, smooth, muscular fibres with characteristic nuclei. After this, and external to it, follows, secondly a strong layer of yellowish circular, fibres of muscular and elastic tissue. This layer is connected above with the sphincter vesica?, where also it is most developed ; whilst below it becomes gradually thinner, and below the caput gallinaginis is either lost, or appears only in very small quantities. On removing the several muscular layers, we come at last to the proper glandular tissue of the prostate, of which individual lobes penetrate among the circular fibres just mentioned, their ex- cretory ducts passing through the longitudinal fibres. In the membranous part of the urethra the smooth muscular tissue is less developed. Under the mucous membrane, whose cellular tissue is remarkable for abundance of elastic fibres, there is a layer of longitudinal fibres, which are connected with those of the pro- static portion. These fibres consist for the most part of fibro-cellular tissue with nucleus- fibres, and include, in small numbers, undulating, delicate, and curved contracting fibre-cells (of the nature of smooth muscular fibres), which may be, in part, isolated; and are from 0'07 to 0-1 of a line long, from 1"002 to 0-003 wide. They contain small nuclei from 0'012 to 0/014 long, and are more easily found in recent specimens than in those treated with acetic acid. External to these longitudinal fibres there is a strong layer of transverse fibres, which belong for the most part to the mus- culus urethralis. Some of these, however, especially those belonging to the inner layer, display some strong bundles of smooth mus- cular fibres, together with fibro-cellular tissue and nucleus-fibres, and a partial mixture of fasciculi of the transversely striated fibres of the musculus urethralis. The smooth muscular fibres are generally still less developed in the spongy portion of the urethra. In some cases they appear in exactly the same manner as the longitudinal fibres in the membranous portion ; in other cases, longitudinal fibres may be seen, but no muscular tissue can be found mingled with the cellular tissue and nucleus-fibres of which they consist At a certain depth, however some longitudinal fibres are distinguishable, with a more or less considerable admixture of smooth muscle, which fibres cannot be re- garded as beams of the corpus cavernosum urethras (corjms spongiosum), since they have no venous spaces between them, but rather form a continuous membrane, which limits the corpus cavernosum urethrae towards the mucous membrane. One might con- sider this part as belonging to the corpus cavernosum urethrae ; in w hich point of view1252 URETHRA. we shall deny an}' muscular membrane to this region of the urethra: but it seems more na- tural to regard the whole corpus cavernosum as a highly developed muscular layer provided with peculiar bloodvessels ; for a large quan- tity of smooth muscular fibres, together with the cellular tissue, vessels, and nerves, en- tering into the structure of its beams and cords as far as the glans, render this body an eminently contractile structure."* On laying open the urethra from its origin at the neck of the badder, the first structure we meet with is the caput gallinaginis (colli- culus seminalis, caruncula seminalis, veru mon- tanum, crista urethra). This is an elongated body situated on the floor of the prostatic part of the urethra : it varies in length from three quarters of an inch to an inch. Com- mencing by a gentle elevation of the urethra, towards which, on either side, are seen some delicate folds of membrane passing, it expands into a small oblong rounded eminence, com- pared to the head of a woodcock, and hence its name : it then advances gradually, tapering to a slender point, which, being continued onwards for some distance, is lost at the beginning of the membranous portion in one or two delicate longitudinal folds, and is con- founded with the general surface of the urethra: the latter part is compared to the beak of the bird. The caput gallinaginis di- vides the prostatic sinus into two lateral de- pressions, into which the secretion of the prostate gland is poured. At the most elevated portion of the caput gallinaginis there is a depression formed by an inflexion of mucous membrane, facing for- wards, variable in size and depth, and gene- rally capable of admitting the blunt end of an ordinary probe : in some cases it can be traced down beneath the third lobe of the prostate, to the extent of the third, or even the half, of an inch. It is called the sinus pocu- laris, utricidus prostaticus, or vesica prostatica, and is the homologue of the protometra, from which the female uterus is evolved.f On either side of this, between its lamina?, or beneath it, are the terminations of the ejacu- latory ducts. A general description of this small cavity has been given under the head of Prostate Gland. The structure of the caput gallinaginis is this : it is for the most part formed of a raised fold of the ordinary mucous membrane of the urethra, beneath which is a longitudinal layer of elastic tissue continuous with the trigone. Some anatomists also affirm that there is mixed up in the tissue of the body a plexus of vessels, constituting a distinct erectile tissue; and hence it has been ima- gined, that when its vessels are distended with blood, as during erection of the penis, it shuts up the prostatic portion of the urethra, and thus prevents the passage of the semen in a retrograde direction into the bladder. My * Kblliker, Beitriige zur Kenntniss der glatten Muskeln, in the Zeitschrit't fur Wissen. t See article Prostate. own opinion as to its use is, that, independent of this office, it is endowed with special sensi- bility, like the papillary orifices of the ducts of Steno and Wharton ; and that it is capable, under the influence of a stimulus, of becom- ing erect, and thus straightening the termina- tion of the canals connected with it, by which the exit of the secretion of the testes and vesiculae seminales is favoured. I believe, further, that something more is clue to these papillary orifices of the ducts of glands, and that, in consequence of their exquisite sensi- bility and sympathy with the glands, they possess a power, under stimulation, of elicit- ing the secretion and expulsion of the fluid of the bodies with which they are connected. A proof of its sensibility may be deduced from the fact, that when a bougie, introduced for the first time/>cr uretkram, reaches this point of the canal, it frequently gives rise to faint- ness and sickness ; and this is usually attended with an almost irresistible desire to micturate ; and further, that if this be frequently re- peated, and the caput gallinaginis be irritated, a flow of semen and vesicular secretion can be excited. The pathology of this portion of the canal leads to the same conclusion. For the relief of nocturnal emissions, so frequently the result of repeated self-pollution, the prasternatural irritability of this part may be successfully destroyed by the application of the nitrate of silver. If the caput gallinaginis be gently raised by dissection from the subjacent tissue, it will be found lying on a delicate tendinous layer, with which it is intimately connected. This layer in shape resembles the body itself, being broader behind and tapering in front, and is gradually confounded with the tendinous covering of the spongy body: it is also continuous with the fascial layer of the utriculus prostaticus. The caput gallinaginis results in a great measure from the coalition of the two lateral portions of the urethra, during the develop- ment of the back part of the canal, from that portion of the uro-genital sinus which gives origin to the prostate and vesicular semi- nales, &c. In the membranous portion there is nothing specially remarkable, except that delicate venous plexus, to which allusion has been already made. In the bulbous part are the terminations of the ducts of Cowper's glands ; and to these bodies I shall now direct attention. Cowper's glands — (glandu/ce Cowperi, gladuuIcE antiprostaticcB velprostaticce inferiores) are two glands situated beneath the anterior portion of the membranous part of the urethra, just behind the bulb, between the layers of the triangular ligament. A. few fibres of the compressor urethras pass beneath them. Some- times a single gland only is found, and occa- sionally there are three ; in which case, ac- cording to Covvper, the additional gland is placed just beneath the pubis. These bodies are frequently difficult to find, and in old persons they either disappear altogether, or become so soft that it is impossible to recog-URETHRA. 1253 4 l 3 nise them. In their natural condition they are rounded, or nearly so, and equal in size to an ordinary pea. Solid and resisting to the feel, they are of a palish red colour, and dis- tinctly conglomerated, or composed of small lobules. The lobules of the glands are con- nected together by cellular membrane, and by their efferent ducts. The glands are sur- rounded by a strong capsule of fibrous mem- brane. On section they present an appear- ance like the pancreas, and are composed in- ternally of elongated cellular follicles, which, according to Krause, vary from the 50th to the 25th of a line in length, and are about the 36th of a line in breadth. Some of these follicles equal in size a 16th or 25th of a line. They unite into slender ducts of about the 18th or ]6th of a line in diameter; these usually coalesce into a single excretory duct. The excretory duct of each gland is occa- sionally double : the ducts run parallel for the distance of half an inch beneath the mucous membrane of the bulb, and approaching each other, they pierce the urethra by two exceed- ingly minute orifices, which are scarcely distin- guishable : the best mode of demonstrating the openings of the ducts is gently to press the mucous membrane forwards with the handle of a scalpel, when a small quantity of secretion contained in them will escape, and indicate their termination on the mucous membrane. Each gland receives a branch from the artery of the bulb, and its veins terminate in the pudic vein. It is impossible to collect any quantity of the secretion of Cowper's glands sufficient for chemical analysis. According to Krause, the fluid is somewhat similar to that secreted by the prostate ; it is of a viscid character, transparent, containing flocculi and small granulations, probably the detritus of epithe- lial cells, varying in size from the 900th to the 370th of a line, the greater number being about the 455th of a line. Comparative anatomy. — As there is so little of a satisfactory nature known about the use of Cowper's glands in man, it may not be un- interesting to examine their condition in the animal kingdom generally. To elucidate this part of the subject, I select the following observations from the Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee of Cuvier. According to Cuvier, Cowper's glands exist in all the Quadrumana and Cheiroptera, and amongst the Ferce they are found in the ichneu- mon, in the civet, hyena, cats ; in the Rodentia, except the hare ; also in the Pachydermata, most of the Ruminants, and all the Marsupiata, They are absent in the Insectivora, the hears, the racoon, otter, and marten, and in the dog. Amongst the Ruminants, they are wanting in the deer; they are absent in the Solipeds, Fhoci, the amphibious Quadriremes, and the Cetacca. It will be found that they often co- exist with the prostate and vesiculae semi- nales, or with these and the vesiculae acces- sorial, or with the prostate alone. In the flesh-eating opossum, they are the only accessory glands, and they appear essen- tial to this division of the Marsupiata. In structure they vary considerably, but may all be arranged under one or two heads. Thus like the prostate, in some animals, there is a large reservoir in the centre of each gland, from which the excretory duct arises ; whilst in others the gland is composed of a number of minute follicles, all terminating in one common excretory duct. In the squirrels and marmots they are large and vesicular, and were mistaken for vesiculae seminales. The fluid which they contain is semi-transparent, or of a bluish, opaline ap- pearance, of the consistence of starch, and it is poured into the bulbous portion of the urethra by a single orifice. They are com- pletely surrounded by a muscular or musculo- membranous envelope. In the ape tribe they are proportionally much larger than in man. In the mantis they are remarkable in size. Their excretory ducts run close together prior to their termination. In the bat, amongst the Cheiroptera, they are very large. In the dismar of Russia they are elongated, and bent in the form of the knee. In the hedgehog they are broad and round composed of a number of straight, short tubes, lying parallel, and dividing into a num- ber of exceedingly small ramuscules. The tubes unite into a single canal, which opens into the pelvic portion of the urethra. In the civet and cat they are large, and enveloped in a thick muscular layer ; but, amongst the Carnivora, they are largest in the hyaena; the lobes and branches of their secreting tubes are exceedingly distinct and large. The anti-prostate glands of the ichneu- mon form a remarkable swelling at the com- mencement of the bulb; they are rounded, and composed of ves^cules communicating together ; these unite into a single canal in each gland, which passes beneath the penis, and opens separately into a cul-de-sac, into which the urethra opens. They are sur- rounded by an aponeurotic and muscular layer. There is a similar structure in the marmot; they are shaped like a club, the broad end folded upwards against the handle, which contains the duct ; the mass is divided into a number of glandular cells. The excretory duct opens into a cul-de-sac, hollo wed out in the bulb: this con- tracts into a narrow canal, which opens into the urethra, near the middle of the penis. In the rat they are of large size, whitish externally, and pyriform in shape. In the agouti they are broad, rounded, and very vascular. In the guinea-pig they are more rounded, but of the same structure. They are spherical, and situated behind the acceleratores arising in the gerboa de Mauritanie, and pyramidal in the gerboa de Schaw. They are broad and rounded in theURETHRA. elephant; they have a similar structure as the prostate, but are comparatively larger ; they are reddish in colour, very irregular exter- nally, and present a lobular appearance. They are divided into two portions; a smaller, near the bulb, and another large portion. In the centre of the first there is a considerable cavity, which receives the fluid poured into it by smaller cavities, and these communicate with still smaller cellules. From the prin- cipal cavity a canal arises, which, communicat- ing with that of the other portion of the gland, forms a single common canal. The ex- cretory duct is formed of two branches; it passes a short distance in the walls of the urethra, before it opens into the bulb. The glands are covered by a thick muscular layer, the fibres of which converge to a tendon, which is fixed to each corpus cavernosnm. In the wild boar the gland is elongated and cylindrical, formed of a firm substance com- posed of minute cells, which uniting form larger cells, and these communicate with a common central cavity, from which an excre- tory duct arises; this opens on the side of a cul-de-sac in the commencement of the bulb of the urethra. They are each completely surrounded by a muscle. In Solipeds they form an oval swelling on each side of the pelvic portion of the urethra. They are sur- rounded by muscular and tendinous fibres : each opens by a dozen orifices, ranged in rows, into the adjacent part of the urethra. Amongst the Ruminants, in the chamois, they are of the shape and size of a pigeon's egg; its canal terminates in the usual situation. They are similar in all ruminants where they exist. Amongst the Marsiqrialia they are remark- able for their number : thus, there are as many as six in the Mexican opossum, phalangers, phascolymus, and giant kangaroo; four in the sarigue and kangaroo-rat. In the giant kan- garoo two are placed, one by the side of the other, over the urethra, just behind the crura penis; two others are situated on each side behind the crura, and are larger than the others. They are all invested by a muscular and aponeurotic envelope, and are composed of canals passing lengthways : they resemble in structure the prostate. In the echidna and ornithorynchus, amongst the Monotremata, there is a gland on each side of the cloaca, small, and of an oval shape, containing within it a central canal opening into an excretory duct: this pene- trates the constrictor cloaca;, and joins a small seminal canal detached from the urethra, near its termination in the cloaca. The gland is surrounded by a thiik muscle, the action of which is forcibly to throw forwards the fluid along the long excretory canal with which it is provided. Cowper's glands are altogether wanting in birds. They are not found in reptiles gene- rally ; but in the amphibious Urodeles the genito-urinary opening is surrounded by a glandular apparatus in some respects ana- logous. In fishes they are wanting. They belong to the class of glands desig- nated by Cuvier as supplementary to the male organs of generation, and their use is to pour out a fluid to lubricate the spongy portion of the urethra, and by blending with the seminal and other fluids, to assist in the general distension of the canal. Bloodvessels of the Urethra. — The urethra is a highly vascular membrane, and its arteries are derived on either side from that branch of the pudic which enters the corpus spongiosum at the bulb, and is known by the name of the arteria corporis spongiosi urethras vel arteria bidbi. This artery divides into small branches, many of which are distributed on the cells of the corpus spongiosum, whilst others pass through this body, and penetrating the elastic tunic of the urethra are distributed upon its mucous sur- face, forming intricate plexuses between and at the basis of its columns : others are des- tined to the lacunas over which they form a delicate network, which conveys to these crypts a cellular appearance. They all freely anastomose on the general surface of the urethra, and at the meatus communicate with those minute branches of the arteria dorsalis penis, which, having reached the prepuce, are reflected over the cutaneous surface of the glans penis. The veins either communicate with those of the spongy body, and empty themselves into the dorsal vein of the penis, or terminate at once in the prostatic plexus by means of those already described in the membranous portion. Nerves. —The nerves are exceedingly small; they accompany the arteries of the bulb, but cannot be traced into the urethral membrane, although the high sensibility of this structure even in health, and especially under disease, indicates at once a considerable nervous supply. The nerves are derived partly from the pudic nerves, which give minute branches, taking the course of the arteries of the bulb, and partly from the plexus situated beneath the neck of the blad- der formed by some small branches of the sacral nerves and sacral ganglion of the sym- pathetic. * The lymphatics — join the superficial and deep lymphatics of the penis, and either ter- minate in the inguinal glands, or, passing into the pelvis with the pudic vessels, join the ganglion situated around the internal iliac artery. Function. — The office of the urethra is to give exit to the urine from the bladder, and the secretions of the testes and their ap- pendages the vesiculas seminales, the prostate and Cowper's glands. For the free discharge of the urine, the urethra is in a passive con- dition, and the penis relaxed, and as free as possible of blood ; the muscles surrounding the membranous portion together with the slightly resisting urethra yield to the efforts of the detrusor urina?, and the urine passes in a stream varying in size and force ac-1255 URETHRA. cording to the condition of the canal. If any obstruction exists either at the prostatic part, or in any other situation, the force, size, shape, or direction, of the urinary stream is altered according to circumstances; and hence, by inspection during the passage of the urine, we can often arrive at a satisfactory conclu- sion of the nature of the obstruction without the introduction of instruments. When, however, the seminal secretion is to be expelled, the condition of the urethra is totally altered, and the canal is diminished in diameter but increased in length from the general distension of the penis with blood, and the consequent erection of the organ. The direction of the anterior part of the urethra is altered and straightened to the utmost ; the prostatic part is raised by the action of the levator prostata', and thus forms a gentle inclination with the membranous part'; and the fluid oozing through the vasa ejaculatoria is collected in the bulb, which thus becomes distended. Although it is not possible to see what is going on, jet we may imagine that at this period of the orgasm a sort of vermicular movement takes place, and that successive contractions and relaxations of the muscular apparatus of this part of the genito-urinary system occur. Thus I appre- hend that the sphincter vesicae effectually closes up the orifice of the bladder, whilst the levator ani and compressor prostata? ex- pel the contents of the vesiculae and the pro- state : and further, that after the bulb is dis- tended with fluid,the acceleratores urinae con- tract with considerable and successive effort, and at this moment the muscles surrounding the membranous part contracting prevent any retrogression of the seminal and vesicular se- cretions, and thus the contents of the urethra are forcibly expelled through the anterior part of the canal, now made rigid by the distension of the penis, and by the contraction of its own peculiar tissue, a forcible muscular effort being required to expel the somewhat inspissated fluids. The erection of the caput galiinaginis, by the distension of its erectile tissue, has considerable influence in closing up the prostatic part of the urethra, and thus assists in preventing its retrogression into the bladder. The action of the acceleratores ur'mce in expelling the contents of the urethra in the venereal orgasm, has been denied on the high authority of Cuvier. Kobelt believes that their sole action is to compress the bulb, and thus to force the blood onwards into the glans penis, and to increase the turgescence of this body ; but that they have no direct influence either in accelerating the flow of ui'ine as their name implies, or in the evacua- tion of the urethra during the act of copu- lation.* There are few parts with which the consti- tution has a more close sympathy than the * Die Mannlichen und Weiblichen Wollust- orgiine rles Menschen, &e. Yon Kobelt. Frei- burg, 1844. urethra: this is evinced by the general disturb- ance of health under the influence of diseases of this canal: thus, in inflammation from gonorrhoea, or even common causes, irritative fever is set up, persisting frequently as long as the disease lasts. So also, when in suspected or actual stricture, a bougie is passed along the canal, faintness occurs, followed by a class of symptoms resembling those of the suc- cessive stages of an ordinary intermittent. When ulceration takes place, a similar train of symptoms sets in. The same is also fre- quently remarked during the passage of stones, or fragments of stone, along the canal. This sympathy must be referred to the general nervous supply derived from the filaments of the sympathetic and cerebro-spinal axis. The sensibility of the urethra is not the same throughout ; it is evidently more intense at the commencement, in the prostatic and mem- branous portions, and near the meatus, than in the spongy part generally. The pain, how- ever, accompanying diseases of the urethra is commonly referred to the meatus, in obedi- ence to the well-known law, that when irrita- tion of any of the mucous surfaces produces pain, this is principally felt at the point where the mucous and cutaneous systems blend into one another, namely at the outlet of the mucous canal. Development. — The development of the male urethra is a subject of considerable interest both in a physiological and patho- logical point of view, as a comprehension of the phenomena attending it enables us to offer a ready explanation of those curious mal- formations to which this canal is not un- frequently liable. For the description of the development of the intra-pelvic portion of the urethra from the uro-genital sinus, the reader is referred to the article Prostate, in which the separa- tion between the bladder and rectum in the male, and the bladder, rectum, and vagina of the female, is considered ; and we have, there- fore, now only to trace the growth anu exten- sion of that portion of the urethra which traverses the body of the penis. Up to the end of the fifth or beginning of the sixth week, the external organs of ge- neration in the male resemble those of the female, and a common opening or cloaca exists, into which the rectum, bladder, and genital organs terminate. At the anterior part of this common outlet a small projection is formed, presenting a concavity below, along which there runs a superficial groove towards the anus. Tiiis corresponds to the clitoris in the female, and the penis in the male. A slight enlargement now takes place at the extremity, which becomes the glans. In the female the two sides of the groove begin to swell out, and become the labia majora. A separation now takes place between the open- ings of the anus and vagina, and the perimeuin begins to be formed. The opening of the uro-genital canal is a small aperture in front of the anus, at the extremity of a slit, which proceeds as far as the root of the penis or 4 L i1256 URETHRA. clitoris, and becomes surrounded by two folds of skin which form its sides. In the male, the two folds of skin which correspond to the labia magora become blended together, and form a projecting ridge, called the raphe; they also form the scrotum. The penis continues to increase in size, but the groove which runs along its under-surface as far as the glans, remains patent until the four- teenth or fifteenth week, when its sides swell out and adhere together, and hence the urethral canal, which is completed about the fifteenth week. The prepuce is formed at the fourth month, and at this period the orifice of the urethra appears in the form of a small slit at the extremity of the glans, but it is com- pletely closed at first. At the period of birth the pelvic portion of the urethra is more vertical than in the adult, in consequence of the position of the bladder, a great part of which is now situated in the abdomen ; the bulbous portion is situated at a greater distance from the anus than after- wards. " The rudiments of Cowper's glands are formed at a very early period, on each side of the genito-urinary passage. Pathology. — Under this head are in- cluded, first, all deviations from the normal condition arising from arrest of development; secondly, all changes in the direction and con- dition of the urethra depending on disease. The first are necessarily congenital, the second acquired. Congenital malformations. — The urethra is seldom altogether absent: it is, however, wanting in cases of decided cloaca! formation, and in the female, where there is partial deficiency of the bladder (ectrophy); but in those cases in which the urachus remains patent, and where the urine is discharged by this canal, the urethra is always met with. The urethra sometimes runs along the dorsum of the penis in the form of a broad groove. This malformation is termed epispadias, from the Greek word Imaitdui, in contradis- tinction to hypospadias, from wiromrdw, sub- traho, as in the latter malformation the penis is drawn down. Epispadias is frequently complicated with ectrophy of the bladder, but often exists in- dependent of this congenital malformation. In either case there is generally consider- able diastasis of the symphyses pubis, the bones being united together by a long inter- vening ligamentous structure. In epispadias there is also a deficiency in the superior part of the prostate gland, the lobes of which are seen only below, and the veru montanum is found in its usual situation ; the prostate is generally smaller than common; the penis also is but imperfectly developed. The urethra itself forms a mere superficial channel along the dorsum penis; it is copiously supplied with large lacunae, the corpus spongiosum is want- ing above, and the glans is cleft; the prepuce ceases at the corona glandis. In a case which I recently examined, the bladder was small, and, as if to supply the deficiency in the muscular apparatus of the membranous part of the urethra, which was necessarily wanting, the accelerators urinae were immensely developed ; their superior attachment was of course deficient. Hypospadias implies that form of malforma- tion in which the urethra runs in a groove beneath the penis ; it is subject to considerable variation. The most common variety is that where the urethra forms a simple groove, and the penis is bent downwards, the prepuce being wanting. If this groove be continued down deeply to the pei'inaeum, between the two sides of a fissured scrotum, the whole genital system takes on more or less of the female character, and hence has arisen the false notion of the subject of hermaphroditism. There are many modifications of this mal- formation. Otto * mentions one case where the penis was cleft, and the vestige of the divided urethra was easily recognised, a fossa navicularis being distinguishable on either side, as well as the termination of an ejaculatory duct. The prostate was wanting. Some- times the urethra is perfect in the glans, and throughout the remainder of its course it is open beneath the penis. The urethra sometimes terminates before it reaches its usual destination. Thus it opens into the rectum, or into the perinaeum; in other cases it goes no further than the root of the scrotum ; sometimes it ends at the corona glandis, or it may end at any distance between this body and the bulb. Occasion- ally the opening is altogether wanting (atresia, urethra;), or it is covered by a delicate fold of skin. When it terminates in any of these unusual situations, the opening is very small, sometimes so small as not to admit the in- troduction of a bristle. Now and then we meet with a rudimentary meatus in the usual situation, terminating in a cul-de-sac, and beneath this a small urethral orifice. When the urethra ends at the corona glandis, the prepuce is imperfect; it is thrown into a fold resembling the hood of a monk, and is hence denominated the monk's hood prepuce, and the glans is uncovered. Deviations in diamater, although occasion- ally congenital, are generally the result of disease. A preternaturally contracted state of the urethra is sometimes found at birth. This may happen at the orifice as before men- tioned, or in other parts of the canal. Under this condition, the bladder, ureters, and pelves of the kidneys are sometimes dilated, as in ordinary cases of stricture.f Congenital stric- ture of the urethra is nevertheless exceedingly rare. Diseases and accidents.'—Dilated urethra is not uncommon as the consequence of stric- ture. When tile bladder is unable to get rid of its contents, the inordinate efforts to overcome the resistance occasion sometimes a gradual dilatation of the urethra behind the seat of stricture. This condition is at- * Monstrorum Sexcentorum Descriptio Ana- tomica. t See article Teratology,URETHRA. 1237 tended with excessive irritation along the whole course of the canal, and the prostate gland becomes hypertrophied in consequence. Sir Benjamin Brodie mentions a remarkable case of this description. In this case the urethra, behind the obstruction, was so di- lated, that, whenever the patient attempted to pass his urine, a fluctuating tumour, as large as a small orange, was felt in the perinseum. It was punctured, and immediately the urine gushed out in a full stream. The escape of calculi from the bladder often occasions dilatation of the urethra into pouches ; and such dilatations occur inde- pendent of ulceration. On dissection of these pouches, the mucous mi mbrane is usually found injected and thickened, presenting fungous vegetations, and occasionally coated with lymph. The urethra deviates frequently from its norma! direction : thus, in large scrotal hernias, and hydroceles of large size, it takes a ser- pentine course: so also, when tumours press on the canal, its course is altered. The same happens in enlargement of the prostate gland, and from the projection of its middle lobe, the urethra divides itself into two streams. Abscesses also distort the canal from its na- tural direction. Tumours in the pelvis, as a collection of hydatids between the bladder and rectum, in consequence of the influence they exert on the bladder, frequently distort the urethra from its normal direction. This dis- tortion occurs more especially to the pelvic part of the canal. Under these circumstances the urethra is generally lengthened to a greater or less extent. Solutions of continuity result either from mechanical injury, or from disease. The urethra may be wholly or in part divided. Most commonly, if the division be incomplete, a small fistulous opening remains for a short time, which subsequently, if let alone, com- pletely closes. Incisions through the mem- branous part of the urethra, as in the opera- tion of lithotomy, speedily cicatrise. The most serious injuries to the urethra are those resulting from blows or falls on the perinavum, especially when they are accom- panied by fracture of the ossa pubis. In these cases there is either partial or complete solu- tion of continuity. The membranous part of the urethra, from its position beneath the pubic arch, most frequently suffers. The na- ture of the injury may be generally recognised by the escape of blood with the urine, or by complete retention of urine. An elastic ca- theter, carefully introduced, will in the former case generally grate ag.iinst the torn part In complete division of the urethra, if the patient survive the injury, the torn ends are, in the progress of the cicatrisation and con- traction, brought into apposition, and the con- tinuity of the tube is restored : stricture is the almost necessary consequence. If, how- ever, the cure is not accomplished, urinary fistula is the unfortunate result. When the complete division of the urethra is accom- panied with fracture of the pubis, the two ends of the canal are frequently so completely separated, that extensive extravasation of urine ensues, and the case is generally fatal. Severe contusion of the urethra, inde- pendent of rupture, sometimes leads to ul- ceration or sloughing, and occasionally gives rise to stricture by inducing chronic inflam- mation of the injured part. Laceration of the urethra occasionally hap- pens from the introduction of foreign bodies, or from the escape of fragments of calculi, especially after the operation of lithotrity. The torn part generally heals under simple treatment, or the urine is infiltrated into the spongy body, and abscess is the consequence. Laceration often attends violent efibrts to force a stricture with the sound or catheter : these injuries usually happen at the under part of the canal, and frequently heal if all violence be desisted from. In a case of la- cerated urethra brought into the London Hospital, a large pouch as big as a small orange was formed in the scrotum, into which, when the man attempted to micturate, the urine was forced ; he then squeezed it through the natural passage. By degrees this pouch gradually contracted, and no vestige of it remained. Inflammation of the urethra, whether com- mon or specific, is usually of the catarrhal form : common inflammation is comparatively rare ; but it may be excited by chemical and mechanical stimuli, or it may depend entirely on constitutional indisposition : thus strong injections have been known to induce every symptom of severe urethritis simulating an attack of gonorrhoea; but the disease is speedily arrested by ordinary antiphlogistic treatment. Under the head of mechanical causes may be enumerated the introduction of the catheter or bougie, and other foreign bodies, and the passage of calculi entire or in fragments, and blows on the perinseum. The urethra is sometimes inflamed from constitutional causes, or sympathetically : thus stone or calculus in the bladder and kidneys frequently leads to urethritis ; some substances taken into the stomach produce the disease, as asparagus, cantharides, and turpentine, and arsenic if administered in large doses, espe- cially if the poison be allowed to accumulate in the system. In persons of a gouty diathesis, urethritis occasionally occurs, followed by a discharge of muco-pus. According to Front, "gouty irritation of the urethra often assumes all the characters of gonorrhoea, and is not only attended by a profuse discharge, but with great irritation ami scalding in passing water." During the prevalence of influenza, I have witnessed a severe attack of urethral inflam- mation accompanied with copious puriform secretion, and attended with the ordinary symptoms of clap ; under the influence of a purge it passed off entirely in a few days. Suppression of cutaneous eruptions, according to the German pathologists, not unfrequently causes urethritis. Inordinate indulgence in venery, and masturbation, produce inflamnm-1258 URETHRA. tion of the urethra by the constant irritation of the part. So also the irritation of the menstrual and leucorrhceal discharges, when applied to the male urethra under states of high excitation, induces a similar pathological condition. Croupal exudations are sometimes found in the urethra. These assume either a tubular form, or the lymph is effused in the form of long shreds.* The mucous follicles situ- ated in the vicinity of the meatus are, ac- cording to Kleeberg, of Konigsberg, liable to a form of inflammation similar to that which attacks the follicles of the genital organs of the female. He thinks that it is sometimes connected with clap, or gleet, and often independent of either. It is indicated by a swollen state of the circumference of the mouth of the urethra, which is of a brownish red colour. There is slight pain in making water. The orifices of the lacuna; become closed by inflammation, and, in the course of two or three days, pustules are formed in their places, which break and discharge a yellow pus. " The orifices of the large mucous fol- licles are now seen dilated and surrounded by a swollen dark-red border, and they discharge a muco-purulent fluid into the urethra : if this be washed off, and the glands compressed, the fluid is distinctly seen issuing from these openings." f The disease sometimes assumes a chronic form. J The specific causes of inflammation of the urethra are syphilis, gonorrhoea, and small pox. Of these, gonorrhoea is the most fre- quent. Syphilitic inflammation, producing chancre, is by no means unfrequent, as Ricord has proved. The disease makes its appearance on the 6th, 8th, and 12th days after connection. Inoculation from the dis- charge produces the true syphilitic pustule. It often attacks the meatus urinarius. Inflammation from gonorrhoea may be either acute or subacute, or the disease may be viru- lent or simple, the difference being in degree rather than in kind. The disease begins in the anterior part of the canal, and is supposed to attack first the lacuna magna. Hunter limited its specific extent to an inch and a half from the meatus. The period of incuba- tion of the poison varies from one to ten days, and is sometimes prolonged even beyond this, if we can believe the accounts of patients. Hunter has known it to appear a few hours after connection, and Sir Astley Cooper met with a case in which it did not make its ap- pearance until after fourteen weeks from the time of inoculation. The pathological changes in the urethra from this disease may be briefly described. The dis- ease, commencing at the part indicated, if left to take its own course, gradually extends itself in a retrograde direction as far as the neck of the bladder, and, in very severe cases, the * See Pathological Museum of the College of Surgeons, Preparation No. 257(3. t Zeitschril't f tir die gesammte Medicin, Band ii. Heft 2. X British and Foreign Med. Review, vol. iii. mucous membrane of this viscus becomes involved. The urethral membrane is swollen, red, and exceedingly vascular : this can only be generally observed at the orifice, but it has also been seen in the middle of the canal in cases where, during an attack of gonorrhoea, the urethra has been divided. The intensity of the inflammation is not uniform. Thus, the lacuna magna, and the beginning of the spongy portion, are most severely attacked. The inflammation attacks the lacuna;, giving rise to pain and swelling in various parts of the canal ; even the spongy body itself be- comes, by contiguity, implicated in the dis- ease, and interstitial deposition of fibrin takes place in its cells, causing unequal dis- tension of this body during erection, and hence painful chordae. Abscess in this body is not very unfrequent. By continuity of surface, the disease attacks the mucous lining of Cowper's glands and the ducts of the prostate, whilst through the ejaculatory ves- sels it passes to the vesiculae seminales, and by the vasa deferentia to the epididymis, causing hernia humoralis. When the latter structures become aflected, the inflammation of the urethra itself in a great measure sub- sides, and the discharge ceases, usually to reappear in a mitigated form. The inflammation of gonorrhoea is neces- sarily of the catarrhal character. At the first onset of the affection there is a slight weeping from the meatus of a transparent fluid, in which mucus particles are floating, probably only the natural secretion of the urethra in excess. This soon gives place to a semi- puriform secretion, which glues the edges of the orifice together. It afterwards becomes more distinctly puriform, and at the height of the inflammation, the discharge, which has increased in quantity, puts on a greenish hue, and is of a faint, sickly odour, as the disease subsides. It changes again as to its character in exactly the inverse order of its appearance. It frequently leaves behind it a gleety dis- charge. The seat of this discharge in gleet is either the general mucous surface of the urethra, the lacunas, or the anti-prostatic ducts, and in many instances the ducts of the prostate gland are alone affected in long per- sistent gleets. When gonorrhoea coexists with chancre, the discharge has usually a greyish or reddish tint, or sanious aspect. Among the most important consequences of this affection, we may mention simple erosion and cicatrices from ulceration produc- ing stricture, and, which is much more com- mon, chronic thickening of the urethra giving rise to stricture. If the diseased urethra be examined after death, according to Hunter, the fossa naviculars and its lacunae are found more vascular than usual, and the lacunas filled with matter. In more severe cases the membranous part, Cowper's glands, and their ducts, are involved in the disease. Littre found, after examining forty cases, Cowper's glands morbid in one only ; and Morgagni met with only one or two instances of aURETHRA. 1259 similar kind. The prostatic part of the ure- thra evinces signs of disease in severe attacks of clap. The glands of Cowper are sometimes in- flamed, independent of gonorrhoea, and be- come indurated ; or they occasionally suppu- rate. Ulceration of the urethra may arise from common and specific causes. In the latter category, chancres take the first rank ; these can only occur in the anterior part of the canal, and are generally found at the urethral orifice. Ulceration, independent of specific cause, is sufficiently common : thus, it may arise spontaneously, or as the consequence of stric- ture, or foreign bodies in the canal, as calculi, pieces of bone, bougies, &c. Spontaneous ulceration of the urethra is exceedingly rare ; it is not mentioned, usually, by writers on the diseases of the urethra. 1 have met with one instance of it myself: in this case three suc- cessive attacks of ulceration had occurred, which terminated in urinary fistula?, one an- terior to the scrotum, one in the perinaeum, and one in the vicinity of the tuber ischii. They were each preceded by rigors, and other signs of fever, and were accompanied by much constitutional disturbance; no stricture, or other appreciable disease of the urethra what- ever, had preceded the ulcerative process. Ulceration behind a stricture is very com- mon ; it depends on inflammation attacking the part as the result of long continued irritation. A stricture itself sometimes becomes the seat of ulceration, when bougies and catheters are used with violence for its cure. It also happens, though rarely, that spontaneous ulcer- ation of the stricture occurs, by which the stricture is cured. Sir Benjamin Brodie re- lates an instance of this. Ulceration consequent on tubercular deposit now and then occurs in the urethra, but only in cases where tuberculosis prevails over the entire urinary apparatus.* An instance of this description occurred to Mr. Robinson of Peckham, in a man who had been the subject of extensive tuberculosis in the urinary and genital organs. The disease appears to attack the follicles. Cancerous ulceration attacks the male urethra in carcinoma of the glans penis and other parts of the organ. Sloughing of the urethra, as a consequence of stricture and violent catheterisation, often leads to the destruction of a considerable por- tion of the canal. In severe cases of small pox, pustules are not unfrequently found in the urethral mem- brane. Abscesses. — As a consequence of inflam- mation, abscesses form in connection with the urethra: they niay be acute or chronic : sometimo-s they communicate with the urethra, but frequently they have no such commu- nication. Abscesses may take place in any part adjacent to the canal: thus, in severe gonorrhoeas, suppuration in the spongy body from inflammation of contiguous parts is not very uncommon ; the same also is occasion- ally met with in the perinaeum, in Cowper's glands, and even in the prostate. Abscesses are not unfrequently met with as the conse- quence of injury to the urethra from blows or falls upon the part. In all such cases the abscess communicates with the canal, and frequently, if not generally, is attended with extravasation of urine. The most common forms are those depend- ing on stricture; they are preceded by ulcer- ation or sloughing, which generally takes place behind the seat of stricture. Syme thinks that ulceration of the urethra is se- condary to the formation of matter, which is external to the urethra, and precedes the ul- ceration. Abscesses now and then form in the vicinity of the urethra without any direct, or indirect communication with the canal ; this happens occasionally in cachectic states of the constitution, in which abscesses are not unfrequentin the vicinity of other mucous out- lets, as the rectum. When these are opened, the matter is disgustingly foetid, and is strongly impregnated with an urinary odour, although no urine has become mixed with it, no breach having occurred in the urethral membrane. One of the most common forms of abscesses connected with the urethra arises from in- flammation of the lacunae during a severe attack of gonorrhoea. Under these circum- stances the orifice of the lacuna, the subject of the disease, probably becomes closed by adhesive inflammation, a small, round, indo- lent tumour is formed in the direction of the spongy body, or in the perinaeum. Ulcera- tion or bursting into the urethral canal often occurs, and the urine escapes into the sac, causing increase of inflammation ; and now distinct suppuration having taken place, fluctuation becomes evident, and either the matter escapes externally by ulceration, or the surgeon is induced to puncture it with a lancet. Tubercles. — Louis states that he has rarely examined the urethra of tuberculous subjects. Rayer, however, quotes two cases, one of which he witnessed himself, and the other was communicated to him by Vernois. The former occurred in a man thirty-six years of age, who had tubercles in his kidneys, testicles, and prostate; the latter in a boy, aged twelve, with tubercles in the kidneys and on the sur- face of the peritoneum ; in this case the whole urethra was apparently affected ; in the other, only two inches and four lines of the vesical end were diseased. Ricord presented to the Academy of Me- dicine* a curious specimen of an urethra completely studded with miliary tubercles. It was removed from a man who had undergone the operation of castration for tubercular deposit in the testicle some years previously. The prostate contained a tubercular excava- tion. * See Eokitanskv. * Seance du 2 AvriL1260 URETHRA. The urethra is sometimes traversed by cords, in some respects resembling at first sight the cord<s ViLlisii of the longitudinal sinus. I presume they are formed by organi- sation of effused lymph. There is a curious .specimen of this disease in the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, marked in the Cata- logue 30. 37. The patient from whom the preparation was taken had been frequently the subject of catheterization. The disease is exceedingly rare. Stricture. — Under this head are enumerated all contractions of the urethra depending on alteration of the tissue of the canal itself, or the parts immediately surrounding it. Stric- tures are commonly arranged under three heads — spasmodic, permanent or organic, and inflammatory or irritable stricture. A spasmodic stricture may be defined to be a temporary diminution in the diameter of the urethra, sometimes to such an extent as to effect its complete closure, from spasm of the muscles surrounding it. The term can only, with strict propriety, be applied to a tem- porary contraction of the muscles investing the membranous portion, as no action of the acceleratores urinag is equal to the complete closure of the spongy part. The common seat of spasmodic stricture is therefore the membranous part. Spasm of the urethra arises from various causes, as exposure to cold, indulgence in wine and venery, and gonorrheeal inflamma- tion. So also, certain medicines, as cantha- rides, when taken into the stomach, or ap- plied endermically, may induce a similar con- dition. Although genuine spasm is confined to the membranous part, yet the remainder of the urethra is liable to temporary contraction from general irritation of the mucous surface, as where the urine is loaded with lithates, and hence becomes exceedingly irritating. Under these circumstances the stream of urine is diminished, and the urethra resists the introduction of the catheter. This con- dition probably depends on irritability of those fibres, be they muscular or not, which enter so largely into the structure of the outer layer of the urethra. Spasmodic stricture may be recognised in the following manner : a patient observes a sensible diminution in the stream of water, aggravated by drinking and free living. After unusual indulgence in wine or venery, he finds suddenly that he is unable to pass a drop of water ; the surgeon, on attempting to introduce an elastic catheter, which is the best adapted for the case, finds the progress of the instrument impeded at the membranous part of the urethra ; by gentle pressure, how- ever, the spasm yields, and the instrument enters the bladder suddenly, and all sense of contraction disappears. On using the instru- ment on the following day, he finds that it passes with perfect freedom. By permanent stricture is understood a narrowing of the canal from organic change in the tissue of the urethra itself, or the corpus spongiosum. Permanent stricture may at- tack any portion of the urethra ; even the prostatic part, the fossa naviculars, and the bulb have been the seat of stricture : thus, Ricord and Cross have met with stricture in the prostatic portions, and the fossa navicu- lars has been found to be the seat of the dis- ease (after ulceration) ; but, although it is by no means unfrequent in the spongy portion, it is most common in the anterior part of the membranous part of the canal. This subject has been examined by various writers on urethral diseases, but the most extended re- searches are those of Mr. Phillips, and I therefore append the result of his observa- tions. He selected a number of cases for examination, and he found that In 9 cases the stricture was distant from the meatus - - - 1 inch. 8 „ „ from 1 to 2 inches. 13 „ „ 2 to 3 11 „ „ 3 to 4 98 „ „ 4 to Si 40 „ „ 5i to 6i 10 „ „ 6.Vto7i This corresponds with the observations of Ducamp, who found that, in five cases out of six, strictures are found at the distance of about 5 inches from the meatus, or from 4 inches 9 lines to 5 inches 3 lines. Amussat states that the most common seat of the dis- ease is the point of junction between the bulb and membranous portions. Varieties of permanent stricture.— Strictures may be spontaneous or traumatic. Traumatic strictures generally occur at the membranous portion, but they are occasionally found in the spongy part. The former result from contusions or lacerations, the latter from di- vision of the canal by cutting instruments, as after the extraction of impacted calculi, or after complete division. Whatever be the cause of traumatic stricture, if stricture en- sues after a wound of the urethra, a cicatrix occurs, as in other situations, and a tendinous puckering of the membrane takes place, giving rise to the most intractable form of the dis- ease. If, however, the stricture results from simple contusion inflammation attacks the part and the stricture is produced as in the common class. After ulceration of the ure- thra from chancre a puckering of the mem- brane gives rise to stricture in its character resembling the ordinary traumatic variety. The most simple form of permanent stric- ture is where the urethra is traversed by a fold of membrane thrown across in the form of a bridle. In this case the stricture is usually in the floor of the canal. It may occur in any part, except the prostatic, but its usual seat is the commencement of the spongy portion. The diameter of the urethra is thus only partially occluded, the shape of the stricture being somewhat crescentic. When the urethra is completely encircled, it appears as if a slender thread were tied around it, and thus an annular stricture, or bridle, is formed, the opening being usually in the middle. The efforts to micturate often push forward the1261 URETHRA. strictured part, thus inducing a valvular ap- pearance. Authorities vary as to the forma- tion of this stricture. Some, as Ducamp and Laennec, believe it to depend on the organ- isation of false membrane thrown out on the mucous surface. Amussat attributes it to the healing of an ulcer, but there can be little doubt that both causes may give rise to a similar condition. Arutzenius considers it due to a swelling of the mucous membrane, and consequent loosening from the subjacent tissue : thus the membrane becomes wrinkled, and a fold is formed on its surface. Hunter attributes the origin of these stric- tures to spasm of the circular muscular fibres of the urethra. Sir C. Bell describes them as occasionally splitting into branches, and running in a longitudinal rather than a circular direction. He considers them as the result of inflammation of the mucous surface: to this opinion most modern surgeons subscribe. Sometimes two or more annular or bridle strictures coexist at short intervals in the same urethra. Hunter met with six, Lallemand seven, and Calot as many as eight. The next variety of permanent or organic stricture is that in which the urethra is nar- rowed to a much greater extent of its course^ than in the former case. In these cases half an inch or an inch, or even the whole extent of the spongy part of the urethra, is more or less contracted. The stricture occupies one or other side, or it completely encircles the tube. It varies in consistence, from a soft, yielding thickening of the membrane, to a complete cartilaginous hardening. The dis- ease in its most simple form occupies either the mucous layer alone, or the submucous elastic layer ; but it is not limited to this, for in many cases the tissue intervening between the submucous layer and the spongy body is the seat of disease, whilst in others even the spongy body itself, whose cells are obliterated by the deposition of lymph, becomes thick- ened and indurated, and thus encroaches on the urethral tube. I regard genuine simple stricture as dependent on hypertrophy of the mucous or epithelial layer and the submucous elastic lamina of the urethra. Stricture in its progress passes through various stages, from simple thickening to complete cartilaginous induration. The com- plete cartilaginous conversion of stricture is more frequently found where the stricture is situated in the spongy portion. The most intractable stricture is that which results from ulceration of the meatus ; it is frequently associated with adhesion of the prepuce to the glands; sometimes the stric- tured part will not permit the passage of a bristle. For the cure of this disease incision is necessary. Among the most common attendants on stricture of the urethra are hernial protrusions of the mucous membrane of the bladder, be- tween the columns of the detrusor wince, in the form of sacculi. As a consequence of stricture of the urethra, may be mentioned rupture of the canal and of the bladder itself. It is probable that these are preceded by interstitial absorption, and not unlikely by sloughing or ulceration. And the straining to overcome the impediment to the exit of the urine leads frequently to the formation of hernia at the groin, and has been attended with rupture of the rectus abdominis muscle.* In old strictures the membrane of the urethra is usually hypertrophied, the orifices of the lacunae are enlarged, and the prostatic ducts considerably dilated. The prostate gland itself is frequently hypertrophied in consequence of the general irritation of the urethra. False passages. — A false passage may be formed in any part of the canal, according to the seat of stricture ; there may be one only, or several may co-exist. The under part of the urethra usually gives way, owing to the direction given to the point of the catheter. Sometimes the catheter, passing beneath the stricture, re-enters the urethra, and is then directed into the bladder, or it may be forced onwards through the prostate gland ; occa- sionally the catheter penetrates but a short distance, and on withdrawal enters the na- tural passage. False passages through the third lobe of the prostate gland not unrre- quently result from unskilful attempts to re- lieve retention of urine from enlarged pro- state ; in this way the gland may be perforated in three or four places. When false passages are maintained by the frequent attempts to pass the catheter, they become lined by a mucous membrane, and the urine is in some ever afterwards discharged through the newly formed canals. Fistulce in perinceo (urinary fistulae) —are a common consequence of ulceration behind a stricture ; they are generally preceded by abscess, and sometimes by gangrene. Not unfrequently they arise independently of any obstruction, as after abscess from acute go- norrheal inflammation. Urinary fistulas result also from wounds of the canal, as after the operation of lithotomy, or the extraction of calculi from the urethra. Suppuration of the lacunae sometimes leads to urinary fistula: this happens occasionally to the lacuna magna. In urinary fistula there is sometimes a single opening into the urethra, with many- external openings. These are found in various situations: thus they occasionally exist anterior to the scrotum, sometimes in the perinaeum, and now and then they open into the rectum, or even as low down as the tuberosities of the ischia : the external and internal openings do not always correspond, the intervening tract taking a tortuous course. The walls of the fistula are much thickened and indurated, and this induration extends for some distance to the parts around, and involves a large extent of the cellular tissue and skin, so that the perinaeum feels as hard as cartilage : the canal of the fistula is lined by a mucous membrane. Sometimes the fistula passes upwards to- * See Dublin Journal of Medical Science, May 1842, p. 308.URETHRA. 1262 wards the pubis, and gives rise to inflamma- tion and caries of the bone; nay, it may take its course even to the groin and lower part of the abdomen. For obvious reasons, stricture seldom happens prior to puberty; nevertheless some rare instances are recorded of the disease in young children. I do not here allude to such as result from mechanical injury, for these may happen at any age. Hunter mentions a case of stricture accompanied with fistula in perinaeo in a boy four years old, but he does not speak of the cause.* He also mentions one in a boy eleven years old. In the Museum of the College of Sur- geons there is a preparation (No. 2535.) of the bladder and penis of a boy seven years of age, laid open to show a stricture at the mem- branous part of the urethra, and behind the stricture a small stone is lodged. The case occurred to Sir E. Home, who also mentions a case of stricture occurring at ten years of age. What is the true nature of a stricture ? I believe that a stricture (1 speak of the per- manent class) may result from the organisa- tion of lymph effused upon the surface of the mucous membrane, as in the formation of bridle strictures. Secondly, that it may arise from the healing or cicatrisation of an ulcer, in which case a fibrous puckering is produced. Thirdly, that it may arise from hypertrophy of the elastic layer beneath the mucous mem- brane. Fourthly, from deposition of lymph between the urethra and spongy body; and, lastly, from deposit and organisation of lymph in the cells of the spongy body ; and that these conditions may all co-exist. When the strictured part is laid open, it will be found that at the exact seat of stricture the mucous surface is raised; and beneath this the submucous elastic lamina is observed dis- tinctly thickened, of a firm texture, and de- prived more or less of its natural elasticity, this thickening passing off gradually and in- sensibly in a longitudinal direction until it altogether disappears and the canal resumes its natural diameter, or is dilated or contracted according to circumstances. The thickening usually extends equally around the urethra, so that the opening of the canal is in the middle of the stricture, but in some instances it is confined to one side. On attempting to dissect the urethra from the subjacent spongy body, it will be found that its adhesion at the seat of stricture is so complete, that it cannot be raised without much difficulty, and in many cases the separation of the two struc- tures cannot be accomplished at all. The spongy body itself is frequently thickened, and the delicate tissue forming the septa of its cells is much hypertrophied. Causes of stricture. — Most strictures are the result of inflammation of the urethra. Long persistent and neglected claps constitute by far the most common of the causes of the disease. I have no hesitation in admitting that the indiscriminate use of stimulating injections * Hunter, On the Venereal Disease, p. 115. may be fairly set down as the occasional cause of stricture. Masturbation, and the too frequent indulgence in the venereal act, may be enu- merated amongst the occasional causes of the disease. Co-existence of stone with stricture. — It often happens that calculus in the bladder co-exists with stricture in the urethra, and the con- nection between the two diseases appears easily accounted for. But some curious cir- cumstances occasionally occurring in these cases, render it very doubtful whether we are justified in indiscriminately attributing the formation of stone to the impediment to the discharge of water from the stricture ; nay, the circumstances to which I allude rather tend to prove the converse of the proposition, namely, that the stricture depends on the ir- ritation in the urethra, maintained by the pre- sence of stone in the bladder. The inference appears legitimately deducible from the fact, that cases of severe stricture have been entirely cured by the removal of the stone from the bladder by lithotomy. * Diseased lacunce.— Sometimes one of the lacuna; becomes the seat of chronic inflamma- tion, and is converted into a small indurated tumour, varying from the size of a hemp-seed to a horse-bean. It becomes imbedded in the spongy body, f According to Sir B. Brodie, the usual situation is about two or three inches from the orifice, but it is sometimes perceptible close to the fraenum, at others within the scrotum. Rokitansky mentions a curious form of disease occurring after repeated attacks of go- norrhoea. " The urethra presented numerous cartilaginous protuberances, from the size of a millet-seed to that of a pea, in part coalescing, and scattered over the inner surface as far back as the bulb, leaving the passage, however, of adequate dimensions." \ Obstruction from, other causes.—The urethra is sometimes occupied by verrucous vegeta- tions, the result of gonorrhoea. Numerous instances of this are given byRicord; they are usually found near the meatus, and are remarkably vascular; but sometimes they exist in the membranous, or even the pro- static, portion. They are distinguishable by their greater vascularity from another form of excrescence or caruncle, which co-exists occasionally with stricture. Both, however, are formed in consequence of irritation of the urethral membrane, and represent simple or- ganised structures connected with the urethra by a base or stem. Hunter met with two, and these were in cases of very old stricture, where the urethra had suffered considerably. Home says, that with all his opportunity in inspecting these diseases in the dead body, he never met with them.

Clielius * says, " they are found as little masses of soft warts behind the stric- ture ; at other times they are found before the stricture ; they are similar to those growths observed on the prepuce and glans. I have seen in one person, who had frequent claps, the urethra filled with round excrescences from an inch behind the fossa navicularis" Morgagni found one in a case of stricture, f These excrescences are developed from the mucous membrane as the result of simple as well as specific irritation, and are limited in the extent of their growth by the walls of the canal. We sometimes meet with a more perfectly organised structure in the urethra in the form of polypi. They, however, are by no means common. Rokitansky met with one in the prostatic part of the urethra, in which situa- tion they are usually found. In the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons there is a preparation (2578 ) of the urethra of an ox, with a large polypus hanging from the verumontanum. Irritable Urethra. — This condition may be recognised by the following symptoms : there is slight increased vascularity of the canal as indicated by the redness of the meatus : the lips of the meatus are glued together in the morning by mucus, slightly tinged : there is a very trifling discharge, scarcely sufficient to discolour the linen ; this is increased by indul- gence in wine; a sense of uneasiness is per- ceived along the canal, and this extends to the testicles and the rectum. The patient has a more frequent desire than natural to pass his water, the stream is diminished, and a scalding sensation is experienced at the extremity of the glans whilst the urine is passing. These symptoms are exacerbated by indulgence in venereal pleasures, and are often associated with increased acidity of the urine ; not unfrequently pain is experienced down the thighs in the course of the nerves, and the patient suffers a slight febrile attack. This state exists, very frequently, altogether independently of gonorrhoea, and appears really to result from a mental cause, the patient being strongly impressed, after a suspicious con- nection, with the idea of impending gonorrhoea. Under the use of diluents and the warm bath this disease very generally passes off. The true pathology of this state 1 believe to con- sist in an increased vascularity of the urethra and its follicles, with a similar condition of the glands of Cowper and the prostate, under the influence of nervous irritability. The prostatic part of the urethra is liable to irritation from long continued masturba- tion. The orifices of the ejaculatory ducts are the special sources of this irritation, but the general mucous surface around partakes of the disease. Neuralgia of the Urethra. — The urethra anil neck of the bladder are consentaneously affected in this disease. The periodic and * Chelius' Surgery, translated by South, vol. li. p. 35G. f Liv. xix. ch. 23. remittent forms of neuralgia attack the urethra : the periodic disease is characterised by deep shooting pains in the canal extending over the loins and sacrum, and down the thighs, occurring in paroxysms, and generally accompanied by sudden and urgent desire to micturate. The attacks recur at a certain hour, generally night and morning, or every second or third day, and during the intermis- sions the patient is altogether free from pain. The urine is thrown out in jets, and some- times stops suddenly, and many of the ordi- nary symptoms of stone in the bladder are present, and hence the great importance of the diagnosis, for there is no doubt that, under this condition, many patients have been sub- jected needlessly to the operation of litho- tomy. The sound alone can decide the question. This disease may originate en- tirely from the ordinary causes of neuralgic affections, or it may depend on local causes, as the use of stimulating injections, the fre- quent use of the catheter, constipated bowels, worms in the rectum : it is often associated with acrid urine, and either leads to, or is ac- companied with, hypertrophy of the detrusor urinee.* In the female. — The female urethra is a short tube by which the urine alone is ex- creted. It commences at the neck of the bladder, and terminates at the meatus urin- arius. The direction of the urethra in the female is similar to the first or pelvic division of that of the male ; thus it descends slightly, and, passing forwards, in nearly a straight direction, beneath the pubis, it makes a gentle ascent just at its termination : it there- fore forms a curve, the concavity of which faces upwards, the convexity downwards, to- wards the anterior wall of the vagina, in which it appears imbedded, and to which it is so closely connected, that it is almost impossible to separate one from the other. In its course it perforates the triangular ligament, which is stretched across beneath the arch of the pubis, and is but an imperfect representative of the corresponding part in the male. The urethra thus forms the first and smallest of the three outlets beneath the pubis. The commencement of the urethra is situ- ated within the pelvis, behind the symphysis pubis, to which it is suspended by the appa- ratus which supports the neck of the blad- der : its next division is directly beneath the inferior pubic ligament, and is connected to it by condensed cellular membrane : the last portion of the urethra passes between the origins of the crura clitoridis, and terminates by a rounded aperture at the anterior part of the vagina, and a little in front of the pubic arch : this aperture is called the meatus urinarius. The female urethra is invested by a muscu- lar apparatus, analogous to that surrounding the membranous portion of the male canal : thus Santorius described some tranverse and circular fibres connected with this part, the latter being situated deepest, and the former * Rowland, On Neuralgia.URETHRA. passing over the canal, and termed by him " the depressor urethrce" So also often ver- tical fibres can be distinguished arising from the back of the symphysis pubis, and analo- gous to Wilson's Muscles, in the male. Guthrie* also has given a representation of a muscle arising from the rami of the pubis, and splitting into an upper and under part, and thus completely surrounding the tube, as the muscle known by the name of " Guthrie's muscle" does in the male: this apparatus in the female can only have the effect of effect- ually closing the canal. The length of the fe- male urethra varies from an inch and a half to two inches; but its diameter is considerably greater than that of the male urethra : thus at its commencement, at the neck of the bladder, it is nearly half an inch in diameter, but it is nearly cylindrical in the remainder of its course, and does not exceed three or four lines in diameter. It is contracted at the meatus urinarius. There are few points of higher practical importance in reference to the surgery of the urinary organs of the female than the extreme dilatability of the urethra. It is well understood that, by the introduction of sponged tents or other mechanical contriv- ances, gradually increased in diameter, this canal may be so far dilated as readily to per- mit the extraction of urinary calculi of at least an inch and a half in diameter; and hence the operation of lithotomy is almost superseded by the more simple procedure of extracting the stone by dilatation. The orifice of the urethra or meatus urin- arius is situated above and in front of the entrance of the vagina, at the further end of the vestibulum, between the nympha?, and anterior to the hymen in the virgin : it is placed at the distance of an inch from the clitoris. To the eye it presents the appear- ance of a closed circular aperture, slightly raised and thickened at its under edge, with a depression in its centre. Without ocular in- spection, it may be found by carrying the fore finger below the clitoris, down along the sym- physis pubis for a short distance, when it can be distinguished by ils forming a soft semi- circular projection, and its corresponding de- pression can be readily felt. Under examina- tion with the finger the projection of the mea- tus increases as if by erection, and thus at once becomes more perceptible to the touch : the inferior lip of the meatus is continuous with the anterior mesian column of the va- gina, and contains within it some large mucous crypts ; this was formerly termed the corpus glandulosum. In order to avoid touching the clitoris, which, as a matter of delicacy, is of no slight importance, the meatus may be easily found without exposure, by carrying the finger into the vagina, along the anterior wall of which an elongated spongy swelling will be perceived ; by advancing the finger along this swelling the meatus may be readily reached. If the urethra be laid open, its mucous * Guthrie on Diseases of the Bladder, &c, pp. 47, 48. membrane is seen thrown into longitudinal plicae, with valleculas or depressions between them. Some of the plica; are larger than the rest: there is usually one large fold along the posterior wall of the canal, and one on either side ; the fold at the back part, after passing for a short distance, generally divides into two branches : it has been compared to the caput gallinaginis in the male. Besides these there are other folds, which, when the urethra is closed, dove-tail into corresponding depres- sions. The mucous membrane is of a rosy tint at the meatus, but becomes paler towards the bladder : it is copiously supplied with mucous follicles. These open generally in the depres- sions between the ruga? ; but there are some large depressions or crypts, into which nu- merous smaller follicles open, situated just within the meatus : these equal in size the blunt end of and ordinary probe ; they are imbedded in the under labium of the meatus, and, forming a considerable projection, consti- tute the corpus glandulosum of some authors. So also, in the vicinity of the commencement of the urethra, there is a collection of large lacunas visible: indeed the under part of the mucous membrane is at this part studded with small orifices of mucous crypts. These are evidently different from the ordinary lacuna of the urethra: the latter are analogous to those of the male canal, and, being situated between the longitudinal plicae, open obliquely forwards. They are the seat of a copious mucous secretion. The mucous membrane within the meatus is slightly depressed at its floor, which gives the urine a direction forwards and upwards. The whole canal is surrounded with a plexus of numerous small veins, mixed with a consi- derable quantity of elastic or contractile tis- sue (the corpus sj)ongiosum) ; hence the female urethra possesses the undoubted attributes of an erectile structure. Organization.—The organization of the fe- male urethra is analogous to that of the male: it is essentially a mucous canal, belonging to the genito-urinary division of mucous mem- branes, and is composed of a mucous layer, covered externally by a layer of contractile tissue. The mucous layer is formed of the ordinary basement membrane, covered with a dense pavement epithelium, formed of broad, oval, and conical, compressed cells. External to this is a layer of that remarkable tissue de- scribed by Kolliker as entering so extensively into the structure of the male urethra, as well as all the other mucous outlets of the body ; this is necessarily much more simple in its arrangement than the corresponding la}er of the male urethra, and is continuous with some of the longitudinal muscular fibres of the bladder. The arteries supplying the urethra are de- rived from the inferior vesicle, the uterine, and vaginal. The veins terminate in the pudic or branches of the internal iliac. The lymphatics terminate in the hypogas- tric ganglia.12C5 URETHRA. Its nerves arise from the piulic and the hy- pogastric plexus of the sympathetic. 'Prostate gland of the female. — Has the fe- male a prostate? Guthrie, in his work on " Diseases of the Bladder and Urethra," as- signs a prostate to the female, which, accord- ing to him, has a form like that of the male prostate, and nearly a similar structure. He says it surrounds the commencement of the urethra. He further states it to be the size of the prostate of a boy before the age of pu- berty ; and rather regards it as existing in a rudimentary form than as an organ possessing any follicular or glandular structure. He con- siders it as of use in giving the urethra support, and as affording a fixed point for the action of some of the muscular fibres of the bladder. Guthrie quotes the authority of De Graaf, " De Mulierum Organis," in support of his opinion. " Sed idterius, inquiret aliquis, unde illi ductus sive lacuna; humorem ilium hauriant? priores ilia; scilicet, quocirca colli orijicium et meatus urinarii exitum conspiciuntur ex parasta- tis mulierum seu potius crasso et membranoso corpore circumcirca meatum urinarium existcnte humorem suum accipiunt; posteriores vero ex nervoso-membranosd colli uterini substantia liquo- rem suum colligunt." De Graaf, however, refers to that mass of follicles surrounding the meatus and com- mencement of the urethra, rather than to any special organ worthy of the designation of jn-os/ate. Cowper also denominates the mass of follicles surrounding the meatus as the " corpus glandulosum." I confess that I have not been able to trace a prostate in connection with the female urethra: there is, however, generally found a firm mass around the canal, which is much thicker at the under part than at the upper, and to which I believe Mr. Guthrie refers. It is certainly not muscular; but it does not present evidences of glandular structure; containing merely a large quantity of areolar and elastic fibre. Accord- ing to the notions of the homologies of the male and female now prevalent, the prostate should be represented in the female by a rudi- mentary structure in connection with the uterus rather than the urethra, inasmuch as it is essentially a sexual organ, and developed in the embryo from the prolomctra. Pathology. — The female urethra is wanting where the entire uropoietic system is absent, as also when the bladder is defi- cient : it is also wanting in cases of ecrophy of the female bladder, and in cloacal formation. In consequence of arrest of development, it may terminate in the vagina, or may receive the vagina or rectum at the posterior part. Sometimes the urethra is abnormally di- lated, as a congenital malformation.* This is rare : it is more frequently dilated after the removal of calculi, &c., from the bladder. Rare instances have been known in which the act of copulation has been performed through the urethra instead of the vagina. * Rokitansky's Pathological Anatomy, vol. ii., Sydenham Society's edition. VOL. IV. Preternatural contractions of the urethra sometimes occur from pressure of the displaced uterus or the prolapsed vagina: they some- times arise, as in the male, from inflammation, and constitute true stricture of the canal: this is exceedingly rare. The urethra deviates from its normal direc- tion in prolapsus of the bladder and uterus ;— it takes on more or less of a serpentine direc- tion ; — this distortion of the canal not unfre- quently gives rise to retention of urine. As the uterus enlarges during pregnancy the blad- der is carried upwards, and, with it, the urethra is slightly raised. The urethra may, however, be excessively dilated without incontinence of urine, of which an instance has come to my own know- ledge. A woman of the town was admitted into the London Hospital, in consequence of retention of the menses : she had imperforate hymen; the urethra was enormously dilated, and no doubt she had admitted sexual inter- course through. She had no incontinence of urine. Dr. Chamberlain also met with a case of imperforate hymen, where the urethra ad- mitted the forefinger.* Dr. Oldham has ob- served the same in atresia vagina;, unattended with incontinence of urine. The urethra suffers a partial or total in- version, forming a tumour at the vulva, attended with difficulty and pain in voiding urine. M. Sernin mentions the case of a girl eleven years of age, who experienced difficulty in making water. He examined her after a vio- lent attack, and found a cylindrical body, four inches long, hanging from the vulva; and whenever she attempted to make water this projection swelled up. It was removed with success. It was presumed to be an inverted urethra.f The female urethra is liable to injuries of various characters: the most common are simple contusions and lacerations, or it may be divided partially or completely by cutting instruments. The urethra frequently suffers contusion with the neck of the bladder in cases of protracted labour, from pressure of the child's head against the pubis. Under these circumstances sloughing often succeeds, and a fistulous communication between the urethral orifice of the bladder and vagina results, lead- ing to incontinence of urine. Lacerations of the female urethra are very uncommon, and require no particular observa- tions ; a simple retention of the parts by suture would be advisable to secure their re-union. Simple incisions of the urethra, as in the operation of lithotomy, generally reunite suc- cessfully : this, however, is not invariably the result, and hence the occasional occurrence of incontinence of urine. The urethra, although extremely dilatable, is occasionally stretched beyond its natural capacity, in the removal of * See also Portal, Ccurs d'Anat. Me'd. vol. iiL p. 476. f Kecul. Period, torn. xvii. p. 304. 4 M12GG URETHRA. calculi or foreign bodies from the bladder, and thus becomes paralysed, and never after- wards recovers its normal tone. This is an unfortunate condition, as it admits of no remedy. The female urethra is occasionally the seat of inflammation : this is almost invariably of the catarrhal form, and may arise spontane- ously or as the consequence of gonorrhoea. The follicles at the meatus are especially liable to inflammation, in conjunction with the fol- licles of the vulva and margins of the nymphae. The disease is described by Dr. Oldham under the head of the " Follicular Inflammation of the Vulva."' It consists of a number of slightly raised vascular points, clustering around the elevated border of the orifice of the urethra, and skirting the margins of the nymphae. The points are isolated and small ; but, as the disease progresses, several of them coalesce, and here and there a minute speck of ulcera- tion may be seen in their centre ; but little or no swelling accompanies it. Dr. Ash well has recognised the same dis- ease, and concludes that the same is alluded to by Dr. Churchill, where he speaks of " a more circumscribed inflammation which may attack any portion of the vulva, and is often seen merely surrounding the orifice of the urethra, and occasionally confined to the clitoris." * Specific inflammation of the urethra is usually the consequence of gonorrhoea. The disease seldom attacks the female urethra until after the vagina has been some time affected. It is easily recognised by a swelling or pouting of the meatus; and on pressing upwards against the pubis the true gonorrhoea! dis- charge appears. It is accompanied with a 6ense of scalding on micturition and pain ; but the symptoms, for obvious reasons, are much milder than in gonorrhoea of the male. It is amenable to the same treatment. Tumours of various kinds are occasionally found connected with the meatus and the urethra itself; the former have their seat especially in the inferior labium of the ure- thral orifice. The most common is the simple vascular tumour, first described by Morgagni as " a red fungous excrescence, the size of a bean, sometimes to be observed [attached to the orifice of the urethra." It has since been recognised by others; and has been well de- scribed by Sir Charles M. Clarke. Sir C. Clarke describes it as a vascular tumour, arising from the meatus urinarius. " Its texture is seldom firm ; it is of a florid scarlet colour, resembling arterial blood, and if violence is offered to it, blood of the same colour is ef- fused. It is exquisitely tender to the touch, and if an accurate examination of it be made, it appears to shoot from the inside of the urethra. Its attachment is so slight that it appears like a detached body lying upon the parts." It is sometimes connected higher up with the urethra, and can then only be brought into view by introducing a catheter or * Ashwell, on the Diseases of Women. probe, and separating forcibly the walls of the urethra, when it will be found attached to the mucous membrane. Mr. Hughes, of Stroudwater, described a tumour " of a red colour, and of a soft, spongy texture, with an irregular, jagged surface, connected with the meatus." He removed the meatus, which completely included the disease. Carcinomatous tumours are also met with in connection with this part. They have been described by Boivin and Duges. They are frequently associated with similar diseases of the uterus. They are generally of the ence- phaloid character, present a lobulated ap- pearance, and are exceedingly painful. If un- accompanied by disease of other organs, they can be successfully removed. Fungoid tumours of the malignant class spring occasionally from the mucous membrane of the urethra. After excision they have a great tendency to recur. They are occasion- ally associated with a similar disease of the bladder. The urethra sometimes becomes thickened along its whole extent. According to Clarke, this thickening exists principally in the cellu- lar membrane surrounding the urethra, and is accompanied by a varicose state of the cir- cumjacent veins. On examination, a bulbous tumour will be found behind the pubis, and if much pressure is made upon it, pain will be produced, but not of a severe kind."* It is accompanied with a mucous discharge from the urethra and vagina. The vessels on the surface of the tumour become so large as to admit of being opened with a lancet. When the patient is erect the size of the vessels increases, and they diminish in the recumbent position. Sometimes a pouch forms in the urethra, in which a few drops of urine are lodged : this can be emptied by pressure with the finger. The mucous membrane covering the tumour is sometimes thick, occasionally thin and shining. The disease occurs princi- pally in married women who have had child- ren ; and, according to Clarke, in those with red or auburn hair and fair complexions. The disease seems to consist of an enlargement of the veins of the part, with hypertrophy of the cellular membrane. The female urethra is rarely the seat of stricture. I have made inquiries of some of the most experienced accoucheurs in London, and they agree that stricture of the female urethra is very rare. The circumstance clearly depends on two causes; the first is the ex- treme natural dilatability of the urethra in women ; and the second is, that, although it is liable to gonorrhoeal inflammation, the dis- ease does not persist long in the canal, and consequently its tissues are not involved in protracted chronic inflammation, as is so com- mon in the male. Sir Benjamin Brodie, however, met with a case of stricture in the female urethra: it commenced at the extremity of the canal, * C. M. Clarke, oil some of the Diseases of Fe- males.1267 4 m 2 URETIIIIA. and extended half an inch back, and was so tight that it scarcely admitted the finest probe. My friend Curling also met with a case of stricture, attended with retention of urine. Being foiled in the introduction of the ca- theter, he was compelled to puncture the bladder in the direction of the canal beneath the pubis. The disease had arisen from the contusion to which the urethra had been sub- jected in a protracted labour, which had taken place twenty-eight years before. Since that time the woman had always experienced dif- ficulty in making water, and had twice suffered retention, but no catheter could ever be passed. The aperture of the meatus was large, and there was great induration around : a small catheter was passed about an inch and a half, but could not be made to enter the bladder. The bladder was punctured, and be- tween thirty and forty ounces of urine drawn off. The stricture was afterwards dilated with bougies. other mammiferous animals ; and it is amongst the Carnivora, in whom the penis is com- paratively short, as the cat and civet, that it appears to bear the largest proportion to the other part of the canal. Cuvier denominates this pelvic part of the canal the muscular por- tion, because it is usually surrounded by a muscular layer. Thus in man and the apes this is especially remarkable on the sides of the prostate, where the levator ani and leva- tor prostate are situated. In the rest of the mammifera the muscular layer is circular. In the Cheiroptera, mole, hedgehog, and cat, it is remarkably thick ; in the dog, civet, and sarigue it is thin ; it is scarcely perceptible in the marmot, where there is scarcely any thing more than a tendinous covering. In the Rodents it is generally of moderate thickness ; but in the Pachydermia and Ruminants it is of great thickness. Cuvier suggests that the object of this mus- cular layer is to expel the urine and seminal secretion, by forcibly contracting the first por tion of the urethra; and hence it is found so The comparative anatomy of the urethra fully developed in those animals whose penis COMPARATIVE ANATOMY. lias been most carefully examined by Cuvier and I have borrowed largely from his cele- brated Logons d'Anatomie Comparee, in my description. Cuvier divides the "urethra into two por- tions ; the first extends from the orifice of the bladder to a short distance anterior to the prostate, whilst the second is continued thence to the orifice at the glans.' In the first portion of the canal in mam- miferous animals generally,—that is, in what is termed in man the prostatic portion,— we find the verumontanum surrounded by prostatic ducts and terminations ofvasa ejaculatoria ; whilst in many the sinus prostaticus is of an enormous size : this is especially the case in the elephant. In many animals we find temporary lon- gitudinal folds of membrane : these are, however, permanent in some, as in the mar- mot : in this animal as many as twelve pass off on each side, and, enclosing small spaces, render the canal exceedingly irregular, and thus retard the flow of urine and semen. is long, as in the Ruminants, and in those in whom that organ is short, as in the cat ; for in the first it is requisite to force the fluid along the lengthened penis, in the latter it becomes necessary to expel it beyond the limits of the penis. He says that this species of ejacula- tion is requisite, when any obstacle exists in the urethra, to the free discharge of semen, as is the case in the porpoise and the dolphin, where the membranous part of the urethra, being wholly surrounded by the prostate, forms an acute angle with the remainder of the canal, and becomes considerably con- tracted at that part. In these animals there is a thick muscle, attached behind to the front of the corpora cavernosa ; the fibres of which, directed backwards, cover the prostate gland, and pass as far as the under part of the neck of the bladder. The office of this is neces- sarily to overcome the difficulty in the expul- sion of the contents of the urethra, arising from the peculiarity just mentioned. In many animals, as in the Ruminants and Pachydermata, the communication between With respect to the comparative length of the former part of the urethra and the second this part of the canal there is great variety. Thus in man and the apes it is short, and surrounded by the prostate. In the makis it is long and slender; it is long in the Chciroptea; and of medium length in the bears. In the hedgehog it is about one third the entire length; it is more than half in the civet, cat, sarigue, kangaroo, and phasco- lome; it scarcely reaches this length in the giant kangaroo ; and is of less extent in the dog. It is actually longer, and its diameter is larger, in the marmot; scarcely half the length in the rat and guinea-pig; somewhat less than half in the hare; short, and not a quar- ter of the entire length in the squirrel; it is not more than a third or fourth in the ele- phant, Pachydermata, Solidungu/a, Ruminants, the dolphin, and porpoise. It is usually re- latively shorter in man and the 'apes than in all or spongy portion is by no means direct ; but it takes place at the superior part of the latter by a sort of opening at a short distance from its commencement: this is the case also in the wild boar. The spongy portion begins under this condition in the form of a cul-de-sac of varied diameter,—a sort of bulb, — into which the semen is received after it has traversed the muscular portion of the urethra, whilst the secretion of Cowper's glands escapes into its sides. In other cases, as in the squirrels and marmots, this cul-de-sac receives only the orifices of these glands, and continues in the form of a short canal, which opens into the urethra either at the middle of the penis, or at a short distance beyond. The urethra in this instance passes over it, and they are both surrounded by the vascular tissue investing the bulb.URINE. According to Owen, in the kangaroo the combined prostatic and membranous or mus- cular part of the urethra is proportionally longer and wider in the marsupial than in any other mammiferous quadrupeds. It swells out immediately beyond the neck of the bladder, and then gradually tapers to its junction with the spongy part of the urethra; it is not, however, divided like the vagina. Its walls are thick, formed of an external thin stratum of nearly transverse muscular fibres, and a thick glandular layer, the secre- tion of which exudes by innumerable pores upon the lining membrane of this part of the urethra.* The urethra in the Monotremala approx- imates in many of its characters to that of the bird. " It begins by a small orifice at the root of the penis, near the termination of the pro-genital passage, and, by the action of certain muscles, it can be brought into closer approximation with the uro-genital passage." Owen supposes that this temporary continua- tion of the urethra and uro-genital passages takes place during the vigorous muscular and vascular actions of the parts in coitu, and that the semen is then propelled from one along the other without escaping into the com- mon ventricular compartment of the cloaca "f According to Cuvier, in the Gerboise de Mau- ritanie the spongy portion of the urethra does not join the corpora cavernosa until it reaches the glans. For the comparative anatomy of the urinary apparatus in birds, reptiles, and fish, see the separate articles on these subjects. The urethra in the females of the lower animals offers no peculiarity worthy of notice.

FUrina; Germ, das Harris, The urine may be defined as that fluid which is eliminated by the kidneys in the dis- charge of their excretory function. The human urine being that of an omnivo- rous feeder, differs materially from that which is excreted by animals purely carnivorous or herbivorous. In cases occasionally met with, however, where, either from congenital taste, want, or the indulgence of eccentricity or curiosity, vegetable food alone has been taken by human beings, the urine has been observed to undergo certain modifications as a conse- quence. The urine, it is obvious, must vary much in constitution, according to the conditions under which the organism is placed, both in respect to external and internal circumstances. Thus the state of the atmosphere, as respects heat and cold, dryness and moisture, will affect the quantity of water excreted, as a constituent of the urine, while the quality and quantity of the ingesta, the state of the chylo- poietic organs, and the amount of exertion to which the body has been subjected, are all causes tending to modify the amount, and perhaps also the nature and quality, of the solid matters excreted by the kidneys. _ When treating, therefore, of the chemistry of normal urine, it must be borne in mind that, in fixing a standard, we are but giving a result more or less approaching to the truth, and that the real method of obtaining a philo- sophical view of its chemical constitution is, to regard the urine in its variations, in the1269 URINE. 4- M 3 Extractive matters. hope of obtaining some fixed law whereon to base a knowledge of the peculiar influence of the several circumstances on which the varia- tions depend. The chemical analysis of this complex fluid was undertaken by Berzelius, who, with his accustomed accuracy, produced a result in which the various improvements and advances in chemistry have rendered it necessary to make but little change. The number of constituents of healthy urine has been but little increased by discovery since Berzelius wrote, one or two only having to be added to his list. It will be our object to enumerate these constituents, and describe such as may require especial notice, before proceeding to consider the quantitative analysis of the urine. The following, then, may be regarded as a list of the constituents of healthy urine : — Water. Urea. f Of four kinds, dif- fering in their reactions and solubility in men- strua. f Of two kinds, brown, Colouring matter. 1 (or kcemaphcein), and (_red (or uroertfthrin). Mucus. Uric acid. Hippuric acid. Carbonic acid. Lactic acid. Sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric acid. Phosphoric acid. Silicic acid. Hydrofluoric acid. Soda. Potash. Lime. Magnesia. Ammonia. Oxide of iron. Other acids, peculiar to urine, have been described by authors, but their qualities are not sufficiently determined to admit of their being yet classified as constituents. Urea. — This constituent of the urine has been supposed by some to form during the evaporations necessary for its extraction. This, however, is not the case, as I have been able to obtain it by agitating the officinal rectified ether with urine in the natural state, and then allowing the ethereal solution, which separates above the urine, to evaporate spontaneously. The urea so obtained is free from lactic acid, showing that the view of MM. Cass and Henry, who consider urea to exist in urine in the form of lactate, is in all probability erroneous. Urea possesses the following ultimate con- stitution:— C2, N2, 114, 02. Its chemical properties are as follows: — When heated on platinum foil it fuses, and on the heat being urged, it yields fumes of carbonate of ammonia. It is very soluble in both cold and warm water. A concentrated solution of urea will bear a heat of 212° Fahr. without decomposition, but it quickly decomposes at that temperature when in dilute solution. Alcohol of specific gravity 0-8!G dissolves one-fifth of its weight of urea at GO0 Fahr. ; boiling alcohol dissolves nearly its own weight. Urea is slightly soluble in ether. The caustic alkalies boiled with urea de- compose it into carbonate of ammonia. The nitric and oxalic acids combine with urea, forming more or less insoluble salts, and on this fact the processes for the extraction of urea, from its combinations, chiefly de- pend. Urea possesses neither an acid nor alkaline reaction. Its crystalline form is that of a four-sided prism. Extractive matters of Urine. — There are four of these extractives; one soluble in alcohol as well as in water, and three soluble in water, and not in alcohol. That which is soluble in alcohol may be ob- tained from the urine by digesting alcohol of specific gravity 0"833 on an extract of urine, and after crystallising the urea by means of nitric acid from the products of the alcoholic solution dissolved in water, separating the un- crystallisable matter, and neutralising it with carbonate of baryta : the mass must then be dried, and alcohol must be used to separate the extractive from the barytic salt. Its chemical properties are as follow : — When heated, it swells much, and leaves a copious alkaline carbonaceous mass.* It red- dens litmus paper. Neither bi-chloride of mercury, nor the acetate of lead, is capable of precipitating its watery solution.f Both acid and alkaline solutions are inca- pable of effecting any precipitation of this ex- tract from its solution in water. Protochloride of tin, nitrate of silver, and di-acetate of lead, produce precipitates. It may be well to mention, that if anhy- drous alcohol be digested on this extractive, which has been called osmazome, it is capable of being divided into two portions; the one soluble and the other insoluble in that fluid. The property of being precipitated by the di-acetate of lead, nitrate of silver, and pro- tochloride of tin, belongs peculiarly to that part of the extractive matter which is soluble in anhydrous alcohol. Animal extractive soluble in water only. — This may be procured by dissolving in water an extract of urine, which has been digested with alcohol of specific gravity 0"833. By the re-solution we separate any vesical mucus, lithic acid, earthy phosphate, or silica, which may be contained in the mass.

This, however, is certainly an over statement. It is present, but in small proportion, in healthy urine. The ultimate composition of hippuric acid is as follows: — C18, H9, Nl, 0 6. It crystallises in four-sided prisms, obliquely truncated. When heated it gives out an odour resem- bling that of the tonquin bean. Lactic acid.—The lactic acid was first dis- covered in the urine by Berzelius, who ex- tracted it by the following process : — A portion of urine was evaporated to dry- ness, and alcohol of specific gravity 0"833 boiled on the solid residuum. The alcoholic solution was next evaporated, and the mass dissolved in water. The watery solution was then boiled with a considerable quantity of hydrate of lime, till all ammoniacal fumes (from decomposing urea) were dissipated; the hydrate of lime now became coloured yellow, owing to the decomposition of animal matter. The colourless solution was filtered, dried, and then treated with alcohol of specific gravity "845. Equal parts of strong sulphuric acid and water were now added, guttatim, to the alcoholic solution, until sulphate of lime no longer precipitated ; the clear liquor being decanted was next treated with carbonate of lead (recently precipitated), and was then filtered and evaporated to dryness. _ The residue was treated with oxide of lead and a little water, by which means the lactic acid was converted into a sub-salt of consider- able insolubility. This was collected, washed with water, and then decomposed by sul- phuretted hydrogen. Thus, sulphuret of lead subsided, leaving the lactic acid free in the supernatant liquor, which, by evaporation, yielded it in the form of an acid yellow syrup, exceedingly deliquescent, and incapable of being thoroughly dried by heat. Its chemical properties are the following: — It gives out an acrid odour * when heated, and leaves a porous charcoal if the heat be continued. Alcohol dissolves it in all propor- tions. It is nearly insoluble in ether. Tts salts are all of a gummy and uncrystal- lisable nature, excepting the lactates of zinc and magnesia, which have been obtained in a crystalline form. When lactic acid is added to a strong solu- tion of the acetates of magnesia or oxide of zinc, the lactates of those bases are pre- cipitated. The existence of lactic acid, as a consti- tuent of urine, has been denied by Liebig, and the question is as yet far from being satisfac- torily settled. The admission made of late by Liebig, how- ever (as the result of his researches on muscle), that lactic acid exists in the juice of flesh, gives great probability to the correctness of Berzelius's statement. * Not unlike that of the tartrates. The other constituents of the urine which 1 have enumerated, require no particular notice in this place ; and for the methods of quantitatively examining the fluid, I must refer to the article Organic Analysis, contained in this work. Healthy urine possesses the following phy- sical characters : — It is of a pale straw colour, limpid and acid ; after standing some hours, it deposits a light, flocculent sediment, com- posed of mucus. This mucus, as it exists in health, suspended in the urine, does not materially interfere with the transparency of the fluid. The odour of urine is peculiar, and subject to modification from the use of various articles of diet, and remedies. Its specific gravity varies, owing principally to two causes — the condition of the atmospliere, as affect- ing the proportion of water exhaled by the skin, and the quantity and quality of the in- gesta taken.. Healthy urine may, under these considera- tions, be said to vary in specific gravity from 1004 to 1032 ; while perhaps, under ordinary or average conditions of diet, temperature, &c, we may place its specific gravity at 1015 to 1022. Quantitative composition of healthy Urine.-^- The quantitative composition of urine must of course vary considerably, owing to the condi- tions noticed above, as affecting its specific gravity. The following is the result of an analysis made on 1000 parts by Berzelius, on a specimen considered as healthy: — Water 933-0 Urea - - - - - 30-10 Free lactic acid - - - -1 Lactate of ammonia - - -I 117.14, Extractive matters (alcoholic and j watery) - - - - -J Lithic acid ----- 1-00 Vesical mucus - - - - 0'32 Sulphate of potassa - 3-71 Sulphate of soda - 3'16 Phosphate of soda - 2'94 Superphosphate of ammonia - - 1*65 Chloride of sodium - 4-45 Chloride of ammonium - - - ]-50 Phosphate of lime and magnesia - POO Silicic acid ----- 0-03 Dr. Bence Jones has experimented very carefully on the acidity of urine in health. His results show that the amount of acidity is always varying. Thus the urine passed longest after food was generally the most acid, and that voided while digestion was going on, much less so, and in some cases even alkaline, though the patient was in perfect health. These conditions pertained, whether a pure vegetable or animal diet was taken. In the case of a pure vegetable diet, however, the decrease in acidity, after taking food, was not so marked as when a pure animal diet was observed ; the urine in the latter case some- times becoming highly alkaline, but in the former never exceeding neutrality. Other analyses of more recent date have1272 URINE. been published by the following observers, viz. Marchand, Simon, Becquerel, Leh- mann, &c. I shall quote several of these from the work of Franz Simon, which has been excellently translated into English by Dr. Day, for the Sydenham Society. Simon analysed two specimens of the urine of a healthy man, 33 years of age. He was of sanguineous temperament. The specific gravity was in the first case 1011, and in the second 1012. 1000 parts yielded — Water - Urea - Uric acid Alcoholic extractive, free lactic acid Spirituous extractive Extractive, soluble in water only, and ves- ical mucus Lactate of ammonia Chloride of ammo- V nium - - - J Chloride of sodium - Sulphate of potassa - Phosphate of soda - Phosphates of lime") and magnesia - J Silicic acid } 1st. 963-20 12-46 0-52 5-10 I 2-60 T3 03 1-00 }■ 1- 03 0-41 5 20' 3-00 2- 41 0-58 a trace k 3 2nd. 95600 14-578 0-710 4- 800 5- 590 2-550 g o w i 7-280 3-508 2-330 0654 a trace. The urine of the same individual was also examined under three varying conditions, as follow: —A, on rising in the morning, several glasses of water having been drunk the pre- vious evening ; B, water and some coffee taken, and violent exercise had recourse to during two hours, pulse 100, with occasional intermissions ; C, urine voided half an hour after urine B. These urines were all acid; C most so, and B the least. All three speci- mens were clear, and B the least coloured. The following is the result of the analyses : A. B. c.

This is very high, indeed, as an average of 24 hours. The mean composition of urine is stated by Becquerel as follows: — Mean from four health} Men. Mean from four healthy Women.

The variations caused in the urine by the ingestion of various mineral substances, and of organic compounds taken either as food or medicine, have attracted the attention of several chemists of eminence. Liebig has theorised freely on this subject, and it is but right that what he has published should be copied into this article, if only as part of the history of the urine, while I would warn the reader carefully to separate in his mind the matters of fact from the theoretical part of the subject, inasmuch as a great deal yet remains to be done. The position of the inquiry is indeed at present such, that further advances may very probably lead us to detect the fallacy of theories which, it is to be feared, the pre-URINE. 1273 sent state of our knowledge may permit us to see in too attractive a form. Liebig remarks, "When the hydrochloric acid (in the stomach) has exercised its solvent action upon the aliments, and the latter have passed into a state of solution, the soda which originally entered the organism in com- bination with the hydrochloric acid, that is, as common salt, rejoins the hydrochloric acid during the preparation of the chyme, anil pre- vious to its transformation into chyle, the soda and the hydrochloric acid thus reunited combine again and form common salt : chyle and lymph have no longer any acid reaction, but, on the contrary, they manifest alkaline properties."* The alkaline reaction of the lymph, chyle, and blood of man and of the car- nivorous animals cannot be owing to the pre- sence of a free alkali, as is evident from the preceding observations ; for the nutriments ot man and of the carnivorous, as well as the graminivorous, animals, contain no free alkali, nor any salt formed of an alkaline base and an acid which might be destroyed in the organism by the vital process, and thus cause the alkaline base to be liberated. The blood must contain the same salts as exist in the aliments. With the exception of common salt, nothing is added during the digestion of the aliments. We have seen that this substance undergoes decomposition in the upper part of the digestive apparatus, being resolved into free soda and free hydrochloric acid ; but we have also seen that the liberated soda rejoins the hydrochloric acid during the pre- paration of the chyme, and previous to the transformation of the latter into chyle; that is, when the acid has performed its function, viz. the solution of the aliments, — the salt formed by this combination, that is, common salt, has neither an acid nor an alkaline re- action. The salts with alkaline reaction con- tained in meat, flour, or grain, are alkaline phosphates. It is obvious that the alkaline reaction of the chyle, lymph, and blood of animals feeding upon animal and vegetable substances can only be derived from their alkaline phosphates. The serum of the blood can only be considered as a combination of albumen with an alkaline phosphate j the fibrin of the blood, or the fibrin of the muscular fibre, is a combination of albumen with phos- phate of lime. " The bibasic phosphates of soda and of potash are in many respects highly remarkable salts. Although of a tolerably strong alkaline reaction, yet they exercise no destructive action upon the skin, nor upon organic forma- tions. They possess all the properties of the free alkalies, without being such: thus, for instance, they absorb a large amount of car- bonic acid, and this in such a manner that acids produce effervescence in a saturated so- lution of this kind, just as they would in alkaline carbonates. They dissolve coa»ulnted curd of milk or cheese, as well as coagulated albumen, into clear fluids with the greatest * Lancet, 1844. facility, just as caustic or carbonated alkalies do. But of still greater importance in relation to the secretion of urine is their deportment towards hippuric acid and uric acid. Hippuric acid dissolves with the greatest facility in water to which common phosphate of soda has been added. Uric acid possesses the same property at a high temperature; the phosphate of soda, in this process, loses its alkaline re- action completely upon the addition of uric acid and hippuric acid, and assumes an acid reaction. The acid nature of the urine of man, and of the carnivorous and graminivorous animals, is thus explained in a very simple manner. "There are but two principal channels through which the salts entering the organism with the aliments can effect their exit from the body, viz. they must either be carried off in the faeces, or in the urine. The most simple experiments show that soluble salts are car- ried off by the faces only when the amount of salt contained in the fluids in the intestines is larger than that contained in the blood. If the amount of salt in these fluids is equal or inferior to that of the blood, the soluble salts are re-absorbed by the absorbing vessels of the intestinal tube, and enter the circula- tion, and are then removed from the body by the urinary organs and channels. If the amount of salt contained in the intestinal tube is larger than that contained in the blood, the salts exercise a purgative action. " If, after previous evacuation of the rec- tum, a weak solution of common salt (one part of salt to sixty parts of water) be taken by means of a clyster, no second evacuation will take place: the fluid is absorbed, and all the salt is found in the urine. This experiment yields the most convincing results if ferro- cyanide of potassium is substituted for com- mon salt. In this case the first urine excreted after the injection of the saline solution, and frequently even after so short a time as fifteen minutes, contains so copious an amount of ferroeyanide of potassium as to yield, upon the addition of persalts of iron, a copious pre- cipitate of Prussian blue. " The influence which salts in general ex- ercise upon the secretion of urine is in the highest degree worthy of attention. It is a well known fact, that a very speedy emission of urine takes place in healthy individuals after drinking fresh pump-water. If ten glasses of water of from six to eight ounces each, containing no more than ^^th of its amount in salts, be drunk at short intervals, an emission of urine of the usual colour w ill, after the lapse of about ten minutes, follow the second glass, and from eight to nine eva- cuations of urine will generally occur in the course of an hour and a half. The urine in this experiment emitted in the last evacuation will be clear and colourless like pump-water, and the amount of salts it contains is little more than is contained in pump-water. There are individuals who are capable of thus im- bibing from six to eight quarts of water con- secutively without any inconvenience !!URINE. 1274 " But the case is quite different with water possessing an amount of salts equal to that of the blood; if even as little as 1-100th part of common salt be added to pump-water, and from three to four glasses drank, no evacua- tion of urine will take place, even two hours after drinking. It is almost impossible to drink more than three glasses of this saline water, for it weighs heavily on the stomach, as if the absorbent vessels had no power of taking it up. This obviously arises from the fluid with- in the channels of circulation, i. e. the blood, and the fluid without these vessels,i.e. the sa- line water, not exercising any physical action upon one another, i. e. not intermixing by endosmose or exosmose. " Water containing a larger amount o. salts than the blood, such as common sea- water, for instance, and even the weaker kinds of saline mineral waters, exercise again a dif- ferent action from that of pump-water mixed with l-100th of common salt ; not only no emission of urine takes place after the imbibi- tion of such saline water, but water exudes from the circulating vessels into the intestinal tube, and, together with the saline solution, is carried off through the rectum; purgation takes place, attended with much thirst, if the saline solution be in some measure concen- trated. " Considering that a certain amount of salts is absolutely necessary to constitute normal blood, we may deduce from these observations and experiments (which any one may easily imitate and verify upon his own person) that the physical condition of the tissues or of the bloodvessels opposes an obstacle to any in- crease or decrease of the amount of salts in the blood ; and thus that the blood cannot become richer or poorer in salts beyond a cer- tain limit. " Fluids containing a larger amount of salts than the blood remain unabsorbed, and leave the organism through the rectum ; fluids con- taining a smaller amount of salts than the blood enter into the circulation, absorb, and remove from the organism, through the uri- nary channels, all the soluble salts and other substances which do not belong to the con- stitution of the blood ; so that, finally, only those substances remain in the organism which exist in chemical combination with the con- stituents of the blood, and which, therefore, are incapable of being excreted by the healthy kidneys. " 1 have convinced myself, by careful and minute examinations, that urine emitted after drinking a copious amount of water invariably contains a somewhat larger amount of salts than the water which has been drank ; whilst the amount of phosphates contained in the last emitted portions of the urine is extremely minute, and no longer detectable by the ordi- nary tests. It is, therefore, obvious that all the salts, without exception, contained in the urine, are to be considered as accidental con- stituents of the blood, which are excreted and removed from the organism precisely because they no longer form part of the normal consti- tution of the blood. The phosphates emitted with the urine were, previously, constituent substances which have been decomposed in the vital processes, or they existed as consti- tuents of the blood, but upon its transforma- tion into living tissues they were not admitted into their composition, they were not required in the constitution of the latter. " Now, among the products of the vital processes, which, together with the soluble phosphates, are removed from the organism through the urinary organs and channels, there are two organic acids, namely, uric acid and hippuric acid, both possessing the property of combining with the soda or potass of the alkaline phosphates, and acquiring in the com- bination a higher degree of solubility than they possess, per se, at the common temperature of the body. It is obvious that, by the accession of these two acids, and by their action upon the phosphates of soda, an urate and hippurate of soda must be formed on the one hand, and an acid phosphate of soda on the other ; and that, consequently, the urine must acquire an acid reaction. " But the presence of these two acids in the urine is not the only cause of its acid nature , there exists another cause, which tends pow- erfully to maintain and increase it. " According to the preceding remarks we ought to find in the urine all the soluble sahs of the food, as well as a small amount of the phosphate of lime, which is soluble to a cer- tain extent in acid fluids, together with mag- nesia. The amount of these latter substances will be in proportion to their solubility in acid phosphate of soda. The other insoluble salts of the aliments we ought to find in the faeces. In other words, assuming that the materials composing the aliments become converted into oxygen compounds, that is, are burnt in the organism, we ought to find in the urine all the soluble salts of their ashes, and in the fasces all the insoluble salts. Now, upon comparing the constitution of the ashes of the blood or of the aliments, or, rather, the salts contained therein, with those contained in the mine, we find that there exists a striking difference be- tween their respective amounts of sulphates. " According to the analyses of the ashes of the grains of wheat and rye*, the urine of an individual feeding exclusively upon bread ought not to contain a single trace of a sul- phate, whilst the urine of an animal fed upon peas or beans ought to contain sulphates toge- ther with phosphates, in the proportion of nine of the former to sixty of the latter. Finally, as flesh contains no soluble alkaline sulphate (broth does not yield any precipitate of sulphate of barytes when tested with salts of barytes), the urine of carnivorous animals ought to be equally free from soluble sul- phates. We find, on the contrary, that the urine of man, according to the most correct analyses, contains a far larger proportion of sulphates than the aliments partaken of; nay, even that the amount of the sulphuric acid * Ami. dcr Chemie, Bel. xlvi. S. 79.1275 URINE. received into the system must, in many cases, be equal or superior to that of the phosphoric acid contained in the aliments. According to the analysis of human urine made by Berze- lius and Lehmann, the amount of the sul- phates present in urine is nearly double that of all the soluble phosphates together. Hic- ronymi found the amount of sulphate of potass contained in the urine of the tiger, the lion, and the leopard, compared with that of the phosphates, to be as 1 to 7t. It can be distinctly and positively proved that these salts have not been partaken of in such pro- portions. But we now know the origin of the greatest portion of the sulphuric acid con- tained in the urine; this acid has entered the organism with the food, not in the form of a sulphate, but as sulphur. " Gluten *, vegetable casein, flesh, albumen, fibrin, and the cartilages and bones, contain sulphur in a form quite different from the oxygen compounds of this substance. This sulphur is separated as sulphuretted hydrogen during the putrefaction of these substances ; it combines with the alkalies, operating upon these animal substances, and may be ob- tained from such combinations in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen by means of stronger acids. " Now, we know from the experiments of Wdhler, that the soluble sulphurets become oxidised in the organism; and that thus, for instance, sulphuret of potassium becomes con- verted into sulphate of potass ; and it is there- fore unquestionable that the sulphur of the constituents of the blood, derived from the aliments, or, what comes to the same point, the sulphur of the transformed tissues be- comes finally converted into sulphuric acid by the oxygen absorbed in the process of respiration, and thus that in the urine it must appear in the form of sulphates ; and from this cause the original amount of these salts contained in the aliments becomes increased. The alkaline base which we find in the urine, in combination with this sulphuric acid, is supplied by the soluble alkaline phosphates; and the latter, in consequence of the loss of part of this base, are converted into acid salts. " By these considerations and views re- specting the cause of the acid reaction of urine, 1 have been induced to prepare an arti- ficial urine, which possesses the properties of natural urine, even although sulphuric acid be altogether excluded. " If 40 grains of dry phosphate of soda (or 90 grains of the crystallised salt, P O- 2 {Na O H O ^ "^l") ^e dissolved m one pound of water, a fluid will be obtained having an alkaline reaction ; if to this fluid we add 15 grains of uric acid and 15 grains of hippuric acid, and the mixture is heated, both acids * Dietrich (in the laboratory of Giessen) has examined gluten with regard to its amount of sul- phur; he found wheat-gluten to contain from 0-033 per cent, to 0-035 per cent, of sulphur, exactly the same proportion as is contained in albumen or fibrin. will completely dissolve, imparting a strong acid reaction to the fluid. The solution thus prepared does not deposit a trace of uric acid at a temperature from 37° to38° (=98°, 100° Fahrenheit = the heat of the blood); nay.it is even only several hours after complete re- frigeration that a sediment is formed, consist- ing of uric acid containing soda : this sediment is of an analogous form to that deposited by natural urine after standing at rest for a long time. Upon collecting this sediment, in one of my experiments, after the lapse of twenty- four hours, I found that it weighed 7> grains, so that there remained still in solution 22-J- grains of the organic acids. Dilute mineral acids produce immediately, in the fluids fil- tered oft' from the sediment, a precipitate of uric acid, " Proust, Prout, and all the other chemists who examined the urine previous to, or about the same period as, Berzelius, ascribed its acid reaction to the uric acid or phosphoric acid; hippuric acid was not known as a con- stant attendant upon uric acid. " It follows, from all we have hitherto stated, that the acid nature of the urine of carnivorous animals, as well as that of man, depends upon the nature of the bases par- taken of in the aliments, and upon the parti- cular form of their combinations. In the flesh, blood, and other parts of animals, as well as in the grains of the cereal and legu- minous plants, there exists no free alkali. The alkali which these substances contain is in- variably combined with phosphoric acid ; the acids formed in the organism by the vital process, namely, sulphuric acid, hippuric acid, anil uric acid, share the alkali amongst them ; and this, of course, must give rise to the liberation of a certain amount of phosphoric acid, or, what comes to the same point, to the formation of a certain amount of acid phos- phates of soda, lime, and magnesia. The proportional amount of the liberated phos- piioric acid varies with the temperature ; at a higher temperature the phosphate of soda dissolves a larger amount of uric acid and hippuric acid than at a lower temperature—■ at from 37° to 38° more than at 15°. It is owing to this that urine, upon refrigeration, sometimes deposits uric acid, or urate of soda in a crystalline state, which, of course, can only take place by the uric acid, at a lower temperature, restoring to the phosphoric acid the soda or potass which, at a higher temper- ature, it had withdrawn from it. At the common temperature phosphoric acid decom- poses urate of soda, whilst, at a higher tem- perature, uric acid decomposes phosphate of soda. When urine, containing uric acid, and manifesting an acid reaction, forms no sedi- ment upon cooling, it shows that the amount of the phosphoric acid and that of the uric acid exactly balance each other with regard to their affinity for soda. Had there been pre- sent a larger proportion of uric acid, this would have separated upon cooling ; whilst, on the other hand, the presence of a prepon- derating proportion of phosphoric acid wouldURINE. 1276 likewise have caused the precipitation of uric acid, because the affinity of the former for soda would then exceed that of the latter. This explains the circumstance that urine, in certain states, when from some cause or other its amount of sulphuric, hippuric, or other acid, becomes increased, precipitates a larger proportion of uric acid than urine in its normal state. The solubility of uric acid in urine must decrease in proportion as the amount of the other acids present in the urine increases, because those acids share the soda with the uric acid ; and, of course, the larger the amount of soda which combines with these other acids, the less comes to the share of the uric acid. It is likewise owing to this, that uric acid very frequently preci- pitates from urine upon the addition of mineral or other acids, and that urine of a turbid, whey-like appearance, from the presence of uric acid, frequently manifests a far more strongly acid reaction than norma! urine. " Now, bearing in mind that the use of alkaline citrate (Gilbert Blane), of neutral paratartrate of potass, bi-tartrate of potass, tartarised soda, acetates of potass and soda, and tartarised borax, renders the urine alkaline by creating in it an amount of carbonated alkali ; and that, likewise, after the eating of fruit, such as cherries, strawberries, ;&c, the urine is of an alkaline nature, inasmuch as these fruits contain alkalies combined with vegetable acids, it is obvious that the acid re- action of healthy urine is purely accidental, and that urine of an alkaline or neutral re- action cannot be considered as a symptom of a diseased condition of the body. All vege- table aliments, without exception, — tubers, roots and leaves, potatoes, turnips, greens, &C,'—contain alkalies in combination with ve- getable acids; potatoes, for instance, contain alkaline citrates ; turnips, alkaline racemates and oxalates, &c. All these plants yield, upon incineration, more or less strongly alka- line ashes, the bases of which were contained in the living plants, as salts of vegetable acids. " It is obvious that by adding these vege- tables to a meat diet, to bread and to other aliments prepared from flour, the nature of the urine must become thoroughly altered ; for the alkalies which these vegetables con- tain in combination with vegetable acids, enter the urine in the form of carbonated alkalies, and neutralise the acids, of whatever kind, which may be present. When partaken of in a certain proportion, they render the urine neutral; when partaken of in a larger pro- portion, they impart to it an alkaline reaction. " The urine of all animals feeding upon vegetables, such as grass, herbs, roots, &c, has an alkaline reaction. The urine of the horse, of the cow, of the sheep, of the camel, of the rabbit, of the guinea-pig, of the ass, &c. is alkaline ; it contains alkaline carbonates, and acids produce in it a lively effervescence. " The acid, neutral, or alkaline reaction of the urine of healthy individuals does not depend upon any difference in the processes of di- gestion, respiration, or secretion, in the various classes of animals, but upon the constitution of the aliments, and upon the alkaline bases which enter the organism through the medium of these aliments. If the amount of these bases is sufficiently large to neutralise the acids formed in the organism, or supplied by the aliments, the urine is neutral , whilst it manifests an alkaline reaction when the amount of alkaline bases thus supplied to the organism is more than sufficient to neutralise the acids; but in all these cases the urine accords with the nature of the aliments taken. " The inorganic bases and acids contained in the urine were, with the exception of sul- phuric acid, which joins them in the organism, constituents of the aliments. The amount of inorganic bases and acids emitted through the urine in twenty-four hours must, in adult individuals, be equal to that of these bases and acids supplied to the organism, during the same period, through the medium of the aliments. "From these data it follows necessarily, first, that the analysis of urine when made without respect to the inorganic salts, acids, and bases, supplied by the aliments, teaches nothing whatever, and by no means justifies us in drawing therefrom any physiological or pathological inference; secondly, that from the nature of the ashes of the aliments we are able to determine, positively, the con- stituents of the urine emitted ; and thirdly, that only when these latter have been dis- tinctly ascertained, can we expect to derive, from the analysis of the urine, any correct information with respect to the inorganic matters which have come to be present in it through processes of disease ; this, at least, is the chemical method of quantitative investiga- tion. "Bearing in mind that the urine contains the soluble constituents of the ashes of the aliments, whilst the fasces contain the insolu- ble part of these constituents, we may form an accurate knowledge of both, at once de- termine in which urine soluble alkaline phos- phates must be present, and in which they cannot exist. The ashes of all seeds, and of flesh and blood, contain a certain amount of soluble and insoluble phosphates, whilst the ashes of vegetables contain no free alkaline phosphate, but only insoluble phosphates. These vegetable ashes contain far more lime and magnesia than is required for the neutral- isation of the phosphoric acid present. Hence, upon incinerating a plant, together with its seed, and lixiviating the ashes, we find no alkaline phosphate in the fluid obtained, although the lixivium of the ashes of the seeds, when incinerated and lixiviated by themselves, yields a considerable amount of these phosphates: the excess of lime and magnesia contained in the leaves and the straw enter here into combination with the phosphoric acid of the soluble alkaline phos- phates, forming an insoluble compound. " It will now be understood why the alka- line phosphates are generally absent from the mine of herbivorous animals, and also why,1277 URINE. in certain cases, they may be found in the urine of these animals. If the nutriment of these animals contains no soluble phosphate-;, their urine cannot contain any ; whilst, if we add a certain proportion of grain to their food, the alkaline phosphates may be detected in their urine. Thus it is obvious, likewise, that the soluble phosphates in the urine of man are merely accidental constituents, and that by simply adding lime or magnesia to the aliments, and thus assimilating the constitution of these aliments to that of the food of herbi- vorous animals, the urine must become altered in its nature and properties. The knowledge of the influence which alkalies, magnesia, anil lime, or acids, exercise upon the properties of the urine, or, in other words, upon the secre- tory process of the kidneys, in the healthy organism, is of the highest importance for the curing of diseases. " I believe that there is now required only a small number of good and correct observa- tions to establish a fixed rule for the remedies necessary in various cases. Future properly- directed experiments will prove whether san- guification is absolutely dependent upon the presence of alkaline phosphates or not ; we shall be able to determine whether weak so- lutions of alkaline phosphates are not the best solvents for uric acid deposited in the bladder; and likewise what is the influence which aliments rich in sulphur, such as mus- tard, for instance, exercise upon the se- paration of uric acid in the bladder, in con- sequence of the formation of sulphuric acid. At any rate, we may, by a judi- ciously-selected diet, alter with positive cer- tainty, and at pleasure, the nature of the urine ; we may, without causing any injury to health, keep it alkaline for a long time, by adopting a vegetable diet ; and this is cer- tainly the first condition necessary to insure the entire prevention of the formation of uric acid, as is the case with the herbivorous animals. By its combination with an alkaline base, uric acid must in the organism resolve itself into its ultimate oxygen compounds with the same facility as other organic acids, if the physician prohibits all substances to be taken as food which, like wine or fat, take possession of the oxygen necessary for the transformation of uric acid into carbonic acid and urea. " The carbonated alkali in the urine of herbivorous animals is separated from the blood by the kidneys ; the urine derives it from the blood ; it is certain, therefore, if we examine the blood one hour or a few hours after the animal has partaken of food, we must find in it this alkali in the same state as it is found in the urine, and that at other periods of the day the ashes of the blood may not contain the least trace of free alkali. But the free alkali does not co-operate in the vital process in the animal organism ; or, if it is necessary in this process, the part which it has to perform may be undertaken with the very same effect by the bibasic and tribasic alkaline phosphates. " In like manner, when we are contemplat- ing the presence of hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice, we must remember that the alka- line bases, soda, potass, lime, magnesia, are present in the aliments whilst in their natural state, invariably in the form of salts ; that is, in combination with phosphoric acid, or with organic acids. When, therefore, in the diges- tive process, hydrochloric acid is supplied by the gastric juice, the first action of this acid is confined to the decomposition of these salts ; the hydrochloric acid withdraws lime from the phosphate of lime ; potass, or soda, chloride of calcium, or chloride of sodium or potassium, is formed on the one hand, and acid phosphate of soda or potass, or acid phosphate of lime, on the other ; or acetic acid, paratartaric acid, or citric acid, are liber- ated by the decomposition of the salts of these vegetable acids contained in the ali- ments. At a certain stage of digestion the chyme will, according to the nature of the food partaken of, contain acid phosphates or free vegetable acids ; and it is only upon the supply of gastric juice continuing, that thus, upon the amount of the hydrochloric acid increasing, we may detect, by analysis, free hydrochloric acid in the chyme : the gas- tric juice taken from an empty stomach con- tains invariably free hydrochloric acid, or acid phosphates." Lehmann has made some very interesting observations, published in the " Journal fiir Praktische Chemie," by which he has shown the effects of diet on his own urine. He first observed the results produced by his ordinary diet during thirteen days, and found that the urea amounted on an average to about 46 per cent, of the wdiole of the solid matter excreted. The average quantity of urea excreted during the 24 hours amounted to about 500 grains. During six days, on an ordinary diet, the uric acid excreted averaged about 1* 089 parts per 1000, and the amount excreted during the 24 hours was about 18 grains. On a purely animal diet, Lehmann found the amount of solid matters discharged in the urine during the 24 hours was much increased. The urine became pale in colour and strongly acid. On the addition of nitric acid, crystals of nitrate of urea were immediately formed, and uric acid was deposited in large crystals. By careful analysis, however, Lehmann de- termined, that though a purely animal diet increases the proportion of urea excreted during the 24 hours, the amount of uric acid is not by any means materially influenced. The earthy phosphates were discharged in large quantities under a purely animal diet, rising to about three and a quarter times as much as when ordinary mixed diet was taken. With respect to the effects of a vegetable diet, Lehmann observed the urine to become of a darker colour than natural, and to remain of an acid reaction much longer than ordinary human urine. The following tables of com- parison have been constructed by Franz Si- mon from the results of Lehmann : they possess a high physiological value.1278 URINE. On mixed Diet.

Leh- mann ascertained also, by other experiments, that the amount of lactic acid, phosphates, and lactates was scarcely changed, whether the subject of experiment lived on an animal, or vegetable, or a mixed diet. A vegetable diet was found to increase considerably the daily discharge of extractive matters; while far less was passed under an animal diet than when either a mixed or vegetable dietjwas used. The following table, containing the results of Lehmann on different forms of diet, as affecting the daily amount of the various solid matters discharged by the urine, is a very important ad- dition to our knowledge of this subject: — Severe and continued bodily exercise was found by Lehmann to increase the discharge of urea, lactic acid, phosphates, and sulphates. He observed a diminution, however, in the proportion of uric acid and extractives dis- charged under the same conditions. Simon, simultaneously with Lehmann, as" certained that the amount of urea, sulphates, and phosphates excreted, is increased by strong bodily exercise. Simon remarks upon this result:—" Further confirmation of the above observation is certainly desirable. If, however, we might assume it as a general fact, it would be an additional argument in favour of my view regarding the formation of urea ; for it would then become still clearer that the urea is not formed during the change which occurs in the blood as a consequence of peripheral nutrition, but that it is formed during those processes which are dependent on the respiratory and circulatory functions, in which we must seek for the greater part of the carbonic acid which is exhaled, and for the principal source of animal heat. I refer to the active metamorphosis of the blood, or to the mutual action excited by the blood corpuscles, the plasma, and the oxygen held in solution in the blood, on each other." Dr. Percy has made experiments corro- borative of the views of Simon. He did not, however, observe any augmentation of the soluble salts, viz. phosphates, sulphates, and chlorides. In relation to this subject, Simon alludes to the opinion expressed by Berzelius, that at least a portion of the sulphates and phosphates occurring in the urine, are derived from the oxidation of phosphorus and sulphur which previously existed as components of protein compounds, which become changed during the metamorphosis of the blood. This view I hold to be especially true as respects the phosphates, and would here refer the reader to a paper of mine printed in the Philoso- phical Magazine*, in which I showed that the amount of alkaline phosphate contained in the serum of arterial blood is much greater than in that of venous, and that the amount of such salt in venous serum can be at once increased by exposing the blood corpuscles to air, and consequently to the action of oxygen during the coagulation of the fluid. I feel satisfied, indeed, from my results, that one great and essential difference between arterial and venous blood consists in the great excess of alkaline phosphate contained in the serum of the blood of the arteries as compared with that of the veins. With respect to the quantity of chloride of sodium excreted by the urine, it is subject to great variation. Simon remarks, that the urine in disease is sometimes deficient in salts, and that this deficiency takes place at the expense of the chloride of sodium. He found but a trace of chloride of sodium in the urine of a patient suffering from typhus. Dr. Bence Jones has made experiments on * On a Function of the Red Corpuscles of the Blood, by G.

The sulphates are increased by food, both animal and vegetable. 2. Exercise does not produce so marked an increase in the sulphates. 3. Sulphuric acid in large doses increases the proportion of sulphates ; in small doses it produces little or no effect. 4. Sulphur, when taken, increases the sul- phates in the urine, and sulphate of soda or magnesia produces the greatest effect on the quantity of sulphates in the urine. With respect to the phosphates contained in the urine, Dr. Jones has arrived at the conclusion, that the quantity of earthy phos- phates depends on the quantity contained in the ingesta, and that this is also the case with the alkaline phosphates. These latter, how- ever, are to a certain extent increased by URINE OF ANIMALS. The urine of animals varies much in cha- racter, according to the kind of food taken. Thus, there are striking differences between the urine of the carnivora and the herbivora. The urine of carnivorous animals is ge- nerally acid when discharged, but becomes alkaline and ammoniacal very rapidly. The urine of herbivorous animals, on the con- trary, is alkaline when passed, and contains a large proportion of alkaline and earthy car- bonates. Simon, however, states the urine of horses immediately after it is passed, to be occasionally acid. The urine of the carnivora, according to the observations of Vanquelin and Hunefeld, contains neither the uric nor hippuric acids. Hieronymi, however, who examined the urine of the lion, the tiger, and the leopard, detected uric acid in small pro- portions. The urine of the herbivora con- tains hippuric acid in large quantities, in the form of hippurate of soda. No uric acid is present according to the analyses of most chemists, but traces of it have occasionally been found in the urine of the graminivora. Hieronymi obtained the following result by the analysis of the mixed urines of the lion, tiger, and leopard. This ma}', therefore, be regarded as the type of the urine of the car- nivora : — Water 846-00 Urea, alcoholic extractive and free lactic acid - - - - 132-20 Uric acid ... - 0"22 Vesical mucus - - - 5' 10 Sulphate of potassa - - - 1-22 Chloride of ammonium, and traces of chloride of sodium - - 1*16 Earthy phosphates - 1-76 Phosphates of soda and potassa 8-02 Phosphate of ammonia - - 102 Lactate of potassa - 3-30 The specific gravity of the urine of these large carnivorous animals varies, according to Hieronymi, from 1059 to 1076. It is clear when passed, and of a bright yellow colour. The urine of the herbivora is turbid when passed, and generally possesses a lower spe- cific gravity than that of carnivorous animals. Thus, the urine of horses, according to Simon, is about 1045. That of oxen, according to Von Bibra, varies from 1040 to 1032. The following are two analyses of the urine of horses by Von Bibra: — Water - - - 885-09 912-84 Urea- - - - 12-44 8"36 Hippuric acid - - 12'00 1 23 Watery extractive - 21-32 19-25 Alcoholic extractive - 25-50 18-26 Mucus - - - 0-05 006 Salts soluble in water - 23'40~| ^q.qq Salts insoluble in water 18-80 J With respect to the hippuric acid present, Von Bibra found that it varied extremely in proportion in different specimens of urine. He never found that it became replaced by the benzoic acid when horses were exposed to excessive labour, an opinion which has been very generally received by chemists. He never, indeed, could detect benzoic acid under any circumstances, except in such small quantities as to require the assistance of the microscope to show its presence. The deposit which causes the turbidity observed in the urine of the horse, is com- posed as follows, according to Von Bibra : — Carbonate of lime - 80'9 Carbonate of magnesia - - 12-1 Organic matter - - - 7 0 The horses that supplied the above de- scribed specimens of urine, were fed on hay and oats, and used in agriculture. Boussingault examined the urine of a horse fed on trefoil and vetches, and states its composition as follows : — Water 910-76 Urea 31-00 Hippurate of potassa - - 4'74 Lactate of potassa - - - 1T28 Lactate of soda ... g-g{ Bicarbonate of potassa - - 15-50 Carbonate of lime , - - 10-82 Carbonate of magnesia - - 4-10 Sulphate of potassa - - - 1*18 Chloride of sodium - 0-74 Silica 1-01 Phosphates, — none present. Chemists have described a red oil as ex- isting in the urine of herbivorous animals, and have attributed the peculiar odour of the secretion to the presence of that substance. Boussingault carefully examined the urine of horses with a view to obtain this oil for examination, but failed to extract it, though he operated on twenty-six gallons. He dis- tilled the whole quantity, but no trace of oil came over into the receiver. All that he ob- tained was a colourless fluid, strongly im- pregnated with the odour of horse's urine. He considers this odour dependent upon the presence of a volatile acid, and believes that the volatile red oil obtained by chemists results from the decomposition of the alkaline1280 URINE. hippurates, and that it is not produced until the urine is evaporated to dryness. The following are two analyses, by Von Bibra, of the urine of oxen obtained at different times. The animals had been fed on clover and hay : — Water - - - 912-01 923'11 Urea - - - 1976 1021 Hippuric acid - - 5-55 12-00 Mucus - - - 0-07 0-06 Alcoholic extract - 14-21 10 20 Watery extract - - 22"48 16-4-3 Soluble salts - - 24'42 25'77 Insoluble salts - - 1"50 2-22 It will be perceived that the insoluble salts or earthy carbonates are in small proportion in the urine of oxen, while in the urine of horses they are present in about equal pro- portion to the alkaline carbonates. The urine of a cow, which was submitted to analysis by Boussingault, gave a result varying consider- ably from that obtained by Von Bibra from the urine of oxen, as above quoted. It yielded in 1000 parts: — Water 921-32 Urea 18-48 Hippurate of potassa - - 16-51 Lactate of potassa - 17-16 Bicarbonate of potassa - - 16-12 Carbonate of magnesia - - 4-74 Carbonate of lime - 0-55 Sulphate of potassa - - 3 60 Chloride of sodium - - 1'52 Silica, a trace. Phosphoric acid, none. The great excess of the earthy salts ob- served m the urine of horses, as compared with that of oxen, is a remarkable circum- stance, and would appear to be in some way connected with the difference in conformation of the two animals rather than on differences in diet. Thus the conditions alluded to per- tained whether the horses were fed on hay and oats, or on trefoil and vetches. The oxen too, the urine of which was examined by Von Bibra, were fed on hay and clover, a diet closely resembling that of the horses j but the earthy salts were, notwithstanding, found in the urine in very small proportion. Voo-el has examined the urine of the ele- phant&nd the rhinoceros. That of the elephant possessed the following characters : 1. It was turbid, owing to carbonates of lime and magnesia. 2. It contained more urea than the urine of the rhinoceros. 3 No hippuric acid was present.* The urine of the rhinoceros is described as follows:— . , „ 1 It was turbid, owing to the presence of carbonate of lime, earthy phosphates, silica and peroxide of iron. _ 2. It <*ave out the odour of formic acid. 3. It yielded hippuric acid in considerable quantity. * Brandes believed he detected the hippuric acid in this urine in combination with urea and an alkali. Chevreul examined the urine of the camel. 1. It contained no uric acid. 2. Urea was present in abundance. 3. No phosphates could be detected. 4. The chief constituents, in addition to urea, were chloride of sodium, hippurate of soda, carbonate of soda, sulphate of potassa, carbonate of ammonia, and traces of sulphate cf soda and oxide of iron. Chevreul considers this urine to contain a volatile oil to which it owes its colour, and to which he ascribes the property it possesses of becoming red on the addition of the mi- neral acids. The urine of frigs has been examined by Lassaigne, Van Setten, and Boussingault. Its specific gravity appears to vary between 1003 and 1013. Van Setten's analysis is as follows : — Water 990-028 Urea 0-750 Uric acid - - - - 0-195 Watery extractive - - 1-708 Alcoholic extractive - - 1-105 Resinous matter - 0 425 Albumen and mucus - - 0'721 Lactic acid - 0'490 Stearin ... - 0-092 Sugar ... - 0375 Phosphate of soda - - T376 Sulphate of potassa, chlorides of potassium and sodium - 2-075 Sulphates of lime and magnesia 0-425 Sulphate of ammonia - - 0'196 Chloride of ammonium - - 0-010 Von Bibra describes the urine of the pig as clear, odourless, and of alkaline re-action. He could not detect uric, hippuric, or benzoic acid in it when operating on three ounces of the fluid; but he subsequently obtained mi- croscopic crystals of hippuric acid. No trace of uric acid could be discovered. Boussingault could not detect hippuric acid in the urine of a pig fed on potatoes and salt. He varied the diet by the addition of green trefoil, but still he could not discover the acid. Von Bibra analysed the urine of the goat. He found it alkaline and of pungent odour, of specific gravity 1008 or 1009. The animals had been kept in a stable and fed on bad hay. From two analyses made on 1000 parts, the following results were obtained: — Water - - - 980'07 983-99 Urea - - - 3"78 0-76 Hippuric acid - - V25 0-88 Alcoholic extractive - 4'54 4-66 Watery extractive - l'OO 0\56 Mucus - - - 0-06 0-05 Soluble salts - - 8-50 8-70 Insoluble salts - - 0 80 0"40 In this urine, as in that of oxen, the alkaline carbonates greatly predominate over the earthy salts. According to Vanquelin, the urine of the beaver contains the colouring matter of the bark of the willow, which is the food of the1281 URINE. animal. He detected it by using alum as a mordant for pieces of cloth soaked in the urine. He detected the presence of bicar- bonates of lime and magnesia, and hippurate of soda. He could not find any phosphates, nor uric acid. The urine of rabbits and guinea-pigs has an alkaline reaction, and contains alkaline and earthy carbonates. It presents no peculiar qualities. Von Bihra analysed the urine of the hare, both in summer and in winter. In December be found the urine turbid and alkaline, de- positing phosphate of magnesia. In June it was only faintly alkaline. The proportion of earthy phosphates present was more than twice as great in summer as in winter, which Simon remarks upon as probably caused by the great difference in the food of the hare during the two seasons. With respect to his examination of the urines of herbivora, Von Bihra states he obtained in most of them indications of the presence of huniic acid, or a substance closely allied to it. As regards these analyses, which are quoted from Simon's work on animal che- mistry, it would appear a matter of regret that experiments have not been made on an extended scale on the same animal, under different conditions ; more especially under variations in food, temperature, and moisture. Such form of inquiry could not fail to be of eminent service to physiology, and much light might thus be thrown on the question of diet, in respect to constitution and predis- position to disease, a subject greatly needing elucidation, notwithstanding the labour and ingenious activity which has been devoted to it during the last few years. Urine of Birds, &c. — The urine of birds is excreted from the cloaca in the form of a thin paste, which hardens by exposure. Urate of ammonia is the principal constituent. The urine of carnivorous birds, however, contains urea in considerable quantity, which distin* guishes it from that of birds feeding on vege- table substances. Chemists have also described a green colouring matter, as peculiar to the urine of carnivorous birds. The constituents of the urine of the ostrich, according to Vanquelin and Fourcroy, are — Uric acid. Sulphate of potassa. Sulphate of lime. Chloride of ammonia. Oily matter. A peculiar animal matter. Acetic acid (?) The urine of serpents is excreted in the form of a white, earthy mass. It is made up of uric acid, combined wich potassa, soda, and ammonia. Phosphate of lime is also present. Cass and Henry state that they obtained urea from the urine of serpents. That prin- ciple was sought for in vain, however, by Vanquelin and Fourcroy. Simon gives the following as the result of an analysis of the urine of a rattle-snake. He VOL. IV. operated on 100 parts, weighed, when quite dry.

Davey examined the urine of the bull-frog (rana taurina). He found it of spe- cific gravity 1003. Urea, chloride of sodium, and a little phosphate of lime were also pre- sent. Marchand's analysis of the urine of the land-tortoise (testudo lubulata) yielded the following result,— Water 950'64 Urea 6-40 Uric acid .... 17-25 Salts and indeterminate organic \ 9^-70 matter J There was no hippuric acid in this urine. It possessed a faintly acid reaction, and is stated to have presented the appearance of pus. Ether extracted a brownish-coloured fat, having an urinous odour.* URINE IN DISEASE. With respect to the urine of the human subject, it has been shown that considerable variation occurs in health according to the modifications which may have been made in diet. The urine of the lower animals is doubt- less, to a certain extent, amenable to the same rule. We observe also striking differences in the urine of herbivora fed on similar diets, as has been noticed above in the case of the horse and the ox, both graminivorous animals anil fed nearly alike for experiment, but whose urine showed, on analysis, very marked and important differences. This variation in the result of the digestive process would appear, in such case, to depend upon the internal arrangement of the chylopoietic organs, anil should perhaps more especially be attributed to differences in the minute anatomy of the mucous secreting surfaces. Certain fixed variations, then, are to be observed in the constitution of the urine as results of differ- ence in healthy anatomy ; and so in the same way, when certain organs are affected by dis- ease, we find a set of changes occurring in the urine quite as marked in character ; and it is of especial moment to the physician that he should be able easily and accurately to appreciate them. While studying those conditions, it is however of the highest im- portance that the changes which diet, the temperature to which the body may have been exposed, the amount of moisture in the air, &c, should be considered, and that the physician should be able to separate in his mind those phenomena which are indicative * Quoted by Simon from Erdinann and Mar- chand's Journal, 1845. iv. 4. 4 NURINE. 1282 of morbid change in important organs, from such as may merely be the results of actions occurring in perfect health, and consistent with its preservation. Many pathological conditions of the urine are indeed closely simulated by the unim- portant changes to which I have alluded. Thus the urine of diabetes insipidus, often a most severe and unmanageable disease, can scarcely be distinguished from that occasionally secreted by healthy persons exposed to cold or moisture, or both, without sufficient exer- cise to maintain the full amount of cutaneous exhalation. Such a specimen, were it ex- amined carelessly, or allowed to guide the judgment without due attention to con- comitant circumstances and previous history, might lead (and I may say has led) to mis- takes both injurious to the patient and vexa- tious to the practitioner. In studying the pathology of the urine, it is also especially important that we should not give undue regard to chemistry, nor be led astray by theories and generalisations such as that fascinating science so constantly would tempt us to enter upon. It must be remembered that in most cases chemistry as yet only assists us in the detection of symp- toms, and in the present state of our know- ledge can only thus far serve us, but must fail as a guide to a true knowledge of diseased action or appropriate methods of treatment. This consideration, however, is far from de- pressing to those who regard the subject in a truly philosophical spirit; for be it remem- bered that when we have detected sugar or albumen in the urine, and when the modes of examination are rendered both easy and exact by chemical labour, we have reaped a most va- luable advantage by becoming acquainted with a symptom, without which, we should have been left in such a position that we might have despaired of ever obtaining an insight into the pathology of two most important diseases. A knowledge of symptoms thus acquired by chemistry at once enables us to make use of a large amount of valuable information derived from experience, and to bring to our assistance remedies which would not other- wise have suggested themselves, or perhaps have been considered inapplicable. It has unfortunately too often been attempted to push chemical reasoning to the uttermost in considering urinary diseases ; and there is a class of persons, greatly increasing in the present day, who have thus inflicted much mischief on a science which requires great labour in its prosecution, and consequently is the more eagerly condemned as useless by the idle or ungifted practitioner. If we con- fine the application of chemistry, in urinary disease, merely to symptomatology, it is easy to show that we are deeply indebted to the science, and it is the especial duty of those who are most conversant with it to regard its further application with great jealousy. I shall now proceed to describe the urine as it appears in various diseased conditions of the bod}', beginning with those variations from healthy constitution characterised by the existence of deposits of various kinds known us urinary deposits. It is not, how- ever, within the province of this article to enter upon any pathological considerations relating to these abnormal conditions. Lithic acid Deposit. This deposit (commonly known as "red sand" or gravel) occurs in urine in many forms, the crystals as seen under the micros- cope presenting the appearances figured below (fig. 191). Fig. 791. Urine depositing lithic acid is generally of a deep yellow colour, and acid beyond the normal degree. Its specific gravity is mostly somewhat above that of health. Lithic acid occasionally deposits from urine in an amor- phous concrete form, and is seen in rounded or flattened masses adhering to the bottom of the chamber vessel. This latter kind of deposit is the most dangerous as respects the formation of calculi. Deposit of Lithates. This form of deposit, known as the lateri- tious deposit, from ts resemblance to brick dust, consists of lithic acid combined with ammonia, and in some few cases with lime, magnesia, or soda. The microscopic appear- ances shown by the lithates are as under {fig- 792). Fig. 792. The spheroidal masses with projecting needle points (b), I believe to indicate lithate of lime, while the masses having projecting crystals with truncated ends (c), 1 believe consist chiefly of lithate of magnesia. The lithate of ammonia is amorphous, sometimes spheroidal with adhering spicula, or is seen making up a dotted background (a). Urine depositing the lithates is generally of a higher specific gravity than natural, and is passed clear. After the deposit has occurred, the applica- tion of a gentle heat is always sufficient to re-dissolve it.1283 URINE. Deposit of Earthy Phosphates. The earth}' phosphates, consisting of mag- nesia in combination with ammonia and phos- phoric acid, are seen as deposits in the urine in two forms, viz. as a monobasic and a bi- basic salt. The monobasic phosphate, which is seen in neutral or only slightly alkaline urine, presents the microscopic appearances as under (Jig. 793). Fig. 793. Urine depositing the first of these two varieties of sediment is generally of lighter colour than natural, and of moderately high specific gravity. The second variety, if not occasioned by the use of alkaline remedies, generally indi- cates important mischief in some part of the urinary apparatus, and is often combined with large quantities of epithelium, mucus, pus, and blood corpuscles. Deposit op Oxalate of Lime. This deposit, which is composed of lime in combination with an acid foreign to the con- stitution of healthy urine, presents itself under the microscope in the following forms, first described by Dr. Golding Bird (Jig. 79o). Fig. 795. The appearance of dark crystals, looking like cubes, is observed when this deposit is allowed to dry. The transparent spot in the centre is caused by reflection from the sides of the octohedron. Urine depositing oxalate of lime is generally of about the normal specific gravity. It oc- casionally has a light greenish hue. The de- posit when allowed to collect in a glass vessel is rarely seen otherwise than as a floating cloud collecting at bottom, and closely re- sembling the appearance which would be put on by the presence of an excess of the mucus of the bladder natural to the urine. It has recently been stated, by Dr. Frick, of Baltimore, that the crystalline masses, in the form of dumb-bells, described by Dr. Bird as consisting of oxalate of lime, are really com- posed of lithic acid. It is true that lithic acid occasionally assumes a form more or less re- sembling the dumb-bells figured by Dr. Bird, but scarcely so nearly as to be easily mis- taken for them. Dr. Marris Wilson has also recently shown that lithic acid may be made to assume a form nearly approaching in character to the dumb-bells. I have ex- amined, with Dr. Bird, some specimens of the dumb-bells, and am satisfied that those we operated upon were composed of lime in com- bination with an organic acid. In a paper recently published by Dr. Bird in the Medical Gazette, some reasons are given by him for believing that acid to be the oxaluric, and not the oxalic, and there would appear good grounds for the adoption of that opinion. Deposit of Cystine. This substance, which is not one of the ingredients of normal urine, is an organic bodj', occasionally existing as a deposit in the form of flattened hexagonal plates. Under the microscope it presents the following ap- pearances (Jig. 79G). Fig. 796. Carbonate of Lime Deposit. This rare deposit exists in the form of spherical masses, more or less crystalline, and apparently made up of slender rhomboidal prisms, diverging from a centre. It presents the following appearance under the micro- scope (Jig. 797). Fig. 797. Hippuric Acid. This exists occasionally in excessive quantity in human urine in disease. Under the micro- scope it shows the following appearance (Jig. 798). 4 N 21284 URINE. Fig. 798. Besides these more or less crystalline de- posits, the urine in disease frequently contains blood, mucus and pus corpuscles, and also epithelial scales, and other bodies of various kinds ; with all of which it is necessary the physician should be familiar, as symptomatic of different diseases. In order satisfactorily to detect these, the microscope is of course indispensable. The following are the appearances shown by these more or less organised bodies, when existing in the urineg (fig. 799). Fig. 799. on a, Blood corpuscles endosmosed or distended, owing to the entrance of the urine through their membrane. This effect is the consequence of the contained fluid of the corpuscles having been heavier than the urine in which they float, in virtue of which condition more fluid passed into the corpuscle than could escape out. b, Mucous corpuscles, c, Pus cor- puscles, d, Scales of epithelium, e, Fibrinous casts of the urinary tubules of the kidney, seen in the morbus Brightii, deposited from albuminous urine — sphe- roidal epithelium from the tubules is seen embedded in these fibrinous casts. /, Spermatozoa, g, Torula diabetica, seen in diabetic urine during its fermenta- tion. A tendency to the secretion in excessive quantity of the unorganised deposits, such as lithic acid and the lithates, oxalate of lime, &c , leads not unfrequently to the formation of urinary calculi. These are either made up, as is most frequently the case, of several of the constituents of the urine, or may be en- tirely constituted of one of them. The following table, constructed by the late Dr. Prout, exhibits a general view of the relative frequency of the different kinds of urinary calculi in England, Swabia, Germany, andDenmark. The hospitals of St. Bartho- lomew and of Guy in London, and those of Norwich, Manchester, and Bristol, principally supplied the specimens quoted in this table. The ingredients of particular species of cal- culi included between parentheses, are to be considered as existing in a mixed state. * For further information respecting urinary deposits, I must refer to Dr. Golding Bird's work on the subject, and my Treatise " on Analysis, and the Treatment of Urinary Diseases."

The data here collected are too limited to throw much light on the relative prevalence of calculous affections in different parts of England, much less in England as compared with the different countries of Eu- rope ; yet in other points of view, and par- ticularly in demonstrating the relative pre- valence of the different species of calculi, and the order of the succession of the different layers of which calculi are composed, &c., they are highly interesting and important. " In this table, the whole of the data com- prising the analysis of 1520 calculi, are col- lected into one point of view, under the general heads of 1. Lithic acid, 2. Mulberry, 2. Cystic oxide, 4. Phospkatic, 5. Alternating, and 6. Compound Calculi. " On each of these heads we shall make a few remarks. "1. Of lithic acid calculi.—The proportions of pure lithic acid calculi to the whole num- bers contained in the different museums, are as follow : — In Bartholomew's Hospital, as 1 : ; in Guy's Hospital, as 1 : 5+ ; in the Norwich Hospital, as 1 : 4+ ; in Swabia, as 1 : Jl-i ; in Copenhagen, as 1 : 5—. The relative proportions of pure lithic acid calculi in the Manchester and Bristol Museums are not mentioned ; hence, abstracting the Man- chester and Bristol, the general proportion of pure lithic acid calculi is as 1 ! C^, nearly. " The relative proportions of calculi in the different museums, composed essentially of lithic acid, (i. e. consisting of pure lithic acid, lithate of ammonia, and the latter ingredient mixed with minute quantities of the lithate and oxalate of lime, and the phosphates,) are, in Bartholomew's Hospital, as 1 : 7— ; in Guy's Hospital, as I : 4— ; in the Norwich Hospital, as 1 : 3+ ; in the Manchester Hospital, as I '. ; in the Bristol Hos- pital, as 1 : 3— ; in Swabia, as 1 : 10+ ; and in Copenhagen, as 1 : 4^—. The general proportion in all the collections is as 1 : 3^—. "If we take into account all the calculi of which the lithic acid or its compounds form the nucleus, the proportions of calculi originat- ing with this principle (and which probably would otherwise have not been formed) is very much greater. Thus in Bartholomew's Hospital the proportion of calculi containing the lithic acid or some of its compounds as a nucleus, is to the whole number of calculi as 1 : If— ; in Guy's Hospital, as 1 : 4—, (not fairly comparable, as the calculi do not appear to be divided ;) in the Norwich Hospital, as 1 : \\-\- ; in the Manchester Hospital, as 1 : If — ; in the Bristol, as 1 : 2\+ ; in Swabia, 1 : 1^ + ; and in Copenhagen, as 1 : The relative proportions of all the calculi originating in some form or combina- tion of lithic acid, in all the different collec- tions, is nearly as 1 : !•§•, which is equal to saying, that if a lithic acid nucleus had not been formed and detained in the bladder, two persons at least out of three who suffer from calculus would have never been troubled with that affection. "Of mulberry or oxalate of lime calculi.— The proportions of mulberry calculi in the different hospitals are nearly as follow : in Bartholomew's Hospital, as 1 : 10+; in Guy's Hospital, as 1 : 4— ; in the Norwich Hospital, as 1 : 31 a— ; in the Manchester Hospital, as 1 : 17; in the Bristol Hospital, as 1 : 6£—; in Swabia, as 1 : 27 ; in Copen- hagen there does not appear to be any cal- culus composed throughout of oxalate of lime ; but if we take the nearest approach to such composition, in which calculi are com- posed principally of this salt with a mixed nucleus, likewise containing oxalate of lime, the proportions will be as 1 : 19^— ; the general proportions in all the museums are as 1 : 14+ " If we take into account all the calculi of which the oxalate of lime constitutes more or less of the nucleus, the proportions in the different museums will be, — in Bartholo- mew's, 1 : 4f + ; in Guy's, 1 : 4— ; in Nor- wich, 1 : 7£+ ; in Manchester, 1 : 4-J + ; in Bristol, 1 : 3^— ; in Swabia, 1 : 27 ; and in Copenhagen, 1 : 2^+. The general pro- portion of calculi, into the nucleus of which oxalate of lime largely enters, in all the museums, is as 1 : 4^-+ ; which is equivalent to saying, that if a mulberry stone had not been formed and detained in the bladder, two persons out of about nine who suffer from calculus would not have been troubled with that affection. "3. Of cystic oxide calculi.— Of this rare form of urinary calculus, four out of the seven museums contain no specimen. Calculi of this substance exist in the museums of Bar- tholomew's, Guy's, and the Manchester Hos- pitals, amounting altogether to five only. Hence the general proportion to the whole number of cystic oxide calculi examined, is only as 1 : 304. " 4. Of phosphatic calculi. — Calculi com- posed throughout of the phosphates are com- paratively of uncommon occurrence; while calculi consisting externally of the phosphates, as will be presently shown, are the most fre- quent of all others. At present we have to do with calculi composed essentially of the phosphates. " The proportion of calculi composed of the phosphate of lime, in Bartholomew's Hospital, is as 1 : 32\; in Guy's Hospital, as 1 : 29 ; in the Norwich Hospital, as 1 : 132f ; in the Bristol, as 1 : 155. The other museums contain no specimen. The general proportion of phosphate of lime calculi, to the whole number, is as 1 : 117 —. " The proportion of calculi composed of the1288 URINE. pure triple phosphate is still less; thus in Bartholomew's Hospital the proportion is as 1 : 129 ; in Guy's, as 1 : 43'- ; in the Bristol, as 1 : 218 ; in Copenhagen, as 1 : 19^—. The other museums contain no specimen. The general relation of the triple phosphate in all the collections, is as 1 : 12Gf. " On the other hand, the proportion of cal- culi composed of the mixed phosphates is very considerable ; thus, in Bartholomew's Hospital, the proportion is as 1 : I2T% ; in Guy's, as 1 : 3J+ ; in the Norwich, as 1 : 19—; in the Manchester, (including those containing a little lithic acid,) as 1 : 81; in the Bristol, as 1:12 4-; in Swabia, as I : Hi + ; in Copenhagen, as 1 : 19f. The relative proportion of the mixed phosphates in all the collections is as 1 : 12^ + . " Under the head of the phosphates are included a few rare specimens of other cal- culi, e. g. carbonate of lime and siliceous cal- culi. Of these two varieties, there is only one of each reported to exist in the Copen- hagen collection ; and one containing silex in the Norwich collection " The general proportion of all the calculi arranged under the heads of the phosphates, in the different museums, is as 1 : 10—. " 5. Of alternating calculi. — Calculi com- posed of different layers constitute by far the most frequent results of urinary diseases ; of the successive forms assumed by which, they may be said to constitute the index. We shall first consider the relative proportions of the calculi composed of two, three, and four deposits ; and afterwards of the whole con- jointly. " The proportion of alternating calculi com- posed of two deposits is, in Bartholomew's Hospital, as 1 : 2\— ; in Guy's, none are reported, probably on account of the calculi not having been divided ; in Norwich, the proportion of alternating calculi composed of two layers is stated to be as 1 : 2$— ; in Manchester, as 1 : 2f ; in the Bristol, as 1 : 3—; in Swabia, as 1 : \%-\- ; and in Co- penhagen, as 1 : 2i—. The proportion of alternating calculi composed of two lay ers, in the conjoint collections, is as 1 : 2f 4-. " The proportion of alternating calculi com- posed of three deposits, is, in Bartholomew's Hospital, as 1 : 6—; in Guy's Hospital, none is reported; in the Norwich Hospital, the proportion is as 1 : 64- ; in the Manchester, as 1 : 26-f- ; in the Bristol and Swabia collec- tions, none is reported ; in Copenhagen, the proportion is stated to be as 1 : 4£—. The proportion in all the collections, is as 1 : S-|—. " Alternating calculi composed of four de- posits are only reported to exist in the Nor- wich Hospital, and the proportion stated is as 1 : 26^4". In the different collections there are twenty-four alternating calculi, the com- position of which is not stated. The propor- tion of all the varieties of alternating calculi in the different collections, is somewhat more than one-half; that is, as 1 : 2—. "6. Of mixed or compound calculi. — In one sense of the term, all calculi may be said to be mixed or compou?id, as there are perhaps none absolutely pure, i.e., formed of a single in- gredient. But in the sense in which the term is here applied, namely, as expressive of cal- culi composed of different ingredients mixed together in large or nearly equal proportions, compound calculi may be said to be rare. The most usual mixtures consist of the lithate of ammonia and of lime; of the oxalate, car- bonate, and phosphate of lime ; of the lithate of ammonia, and the mixed phosphates, &c.; and such mixtures are usually confined to small calculi or calculous nuclei. Calculi composed of pure lithic acid, or of any other pure ingredient, with the phosphates or other compounds, do not appear to exist; at least I have met with no such mixtures. " Lastly, it remains to make a few remarks on the order of calculous deposits ; an inquiry that throws considerable light on the laws of their formation and general pathology. " On reference to the table it will be found, that in the different alternating calculi, the ratio in which the oxalate of lime succeeds to lithic acid, is as 1 : 15f 4- ; on the contrary, that the ratio in which lithic acid succeeds to oxalic acid, is as 1 : 13"^-. Hence the alter- nation of the two ingredients may be con- sidered as nearly equal. It will be found, however, that the oxalate of lime succeeds to the lithate of ammonia, &c, more frequently than to lithic acid; thus the ratio in which the oxalate of lime succeeds to the lithate of ammonia was 1 : 9f—. On the contrary, the ratio in which the lithate of ammonia succeeds to the oxalate of lime, is only as 1 : 38 ; a very striking distinction. The ratio in which the phosphates succeed to lithic acid, is as 1 : 9i'— ; in which the phosphates succeed to the lithate of ammonia, is as 1 : 12.£— ; and in which the phosphates succeed to the oxa- late of lime, is as 1 : 7j-f-. On the contrary, three instances only occur in which the lithic acid or lithate of ammonia succeeds to a phosphate ; and the proportion in which the oxalate of lime succeeds to the phosphates is as 1 : 253£ only. The general proportion in which the phosphates succeed to the other ingredients in all the collections, is as 1 : Hence the generality of the im- portant law alluded to in various parts of this volume, that in urinary calculi a decided depo- sition of the mixed phosphates is not followed by other depositions." The following table, constructed by Dr. Prout, illustrating the frequency of calculous affections at different ages, and in the different sexes, is from a paper published by Mr. Smith in the eleventh volume of the Med.

Since like effects follow like causes, and since in inflammatory affections the vascular system similarly participates in the disturbance, we may assume a priori that similar changes will occur in the urine,—a point confirmed by ex- perience. " The urine discharged during inflammations is usually termed febrile urine. There is no objection to this term, since the cause of the change in the urine must be sought for in the fever. I shall not, however, introduce the term ' febrile urine' here, since it is more than probable that the changes in the compo- sition of the urine vary according as the cha- racter of the fever is synochal or torpid. " My analyses show, in fact, that the relative proportions of urea in fevers of a torpid and of a synochal character are different; and al- though the analyses are not yet sufficiently numerous to establish the difference with cer- tainty, it still appears to me to be a point of sufficient importance to demand attention, and one that should be carefully worked out. In order to take a correct view of the compo- sition of the urine, we must bear in mind the composition of the blood, the reaction of the vascular system, and the diet, since the mix- ture of the proximate constituents is de- pendent upon these circumstances. " The following are the general characteris- tics of the urine in inflammatory affections. It is darker than usual, and of a yellow, brown, or reddish-brown tint; it has an acid reaction, and is generally of a high specific gravity. With respect to its most important consti- tuents, the urea is either absolutely increased, or is at the ordinary physiological average, or may be a little below it; the uric acid is always absolutely increased, and so are the extractive matters, especially the alcoholic extract. The salts are always absolutely di- minished, especially the chloride of sodium. The sulphates, on the other hand, either ap- proximate to the physiological average, or are not far below it. " Assuming as the mean of numerous ana- lyses, that the urea constitutes 39 per cent, of the solid residue of normal urine, 1 have found it as high as 46*8 in inflammatory af- fections. (In abdominal typhus, with a quick small pulse, I have seen it as low as 22.) " The physiological average of uric acid may be placed at'1'5 per cent, of the solid residue ; in the phlogoses I have observed it amount to nearly 3 per cent., and Becquerel even found it rise as high as 5 9 per cent. The quan- tity of extractive matter, &c, which in normal urine amounts to 23-5 per cent, of the solid residue, rises in inflammations to 43 per cent. The fixed salts, which in healthy urine con- stitute about 25 per cent, of the solid residue* diminish here to 12 per cent. The sulphate of potash, which in healthy urine forms about 10 per cent, of the solid residue, I found to vary in inflammation between 7 and 9 per cent. " The composition of the urine becomes changed if much blood is abstracted during the inflammation. It becomes clearer, speci- fically lighter, and the amount of urea de- creases absolutely and relatively. " At the height of the inflammation, or (per- haps it would be better to say) at the time •when the fever puts on the synochal type most strongly, the urine is usually clear and deeply coloured ; it subsequently forms a sediment of a yellow or red colour, composed of uric acid and urates." I shall now proceed to describe the state of the urine as it is observed in different diseases. Pericarditis.— A managed 36.

The second shows the effects of the copious bleedings in reducing the excretion nearer to the normal standard. With respect to the presence of albumen in the urine in this and other inflammatory affections unconnected with disease of the kidneys, there is in my mind no doubt what- ever that the opinion is founded in error. There is no institution in the world at which the question has been so thoroughly investi- gated as at Guy's Hospital; and our daily ex- perience still confirms the opinions arrived at by Dr. Bright in his first experiments. It will be observed that the test of heat (a most inefficient one in itself) is alone referred to in the above-described case; and I have little doubt the precipitate produced was composed of phosphate of lime, a common source of1291 URINE. fallacy which I pointed out some years ago in connection with this subject.* Phlebitis Uterina. The following is a description, by F. Simon' of specimens of urine in this disease. 1. Co- lour dark ; reaction acid ; deposit of uric acid and urate of ammonia. 2. Colour dark ; al- kaline reaction ; ammoniacal odour; deposit dirty yellow in colour, composed of mucus, ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, amorphous precipitate of phosphate of lime, and urate of ammonia. Meningitis. The urine in this disease assumes the or- dinary inflammatory type. It is described as dark red, scanty (8 to 9 fluid ounces in the twenty-four hours), strongly acid ; specific gravity high. According to Becquerel, the mean of four cases was 1025*2. Deposit of uric acid, which, if not present spontaneously, is immediately produced by the addition of nitric acid. Encephalitis. Urine much the same as in meningitis ; sometimes a sediment. Spec, gravity, 1020-2. Observations have been made by several foreign writers on the state of the urine in insanity. Drs. Sutherland and Rigby have also paid some attention to the subject. It appears to be generally alkaline, and to con- tain much ammonia in these cases ; the whole subject, however, needs further and cartful investigation. Dr. Bence Jones states, that in acute inflammation of the brain there is an increase in the total amount of phosphates excreted in the urine. Delirium Tremens. In this disease the urine is said to present the general features of the inflammatory type. Dr. Bence Jones states, that in delirium tremens the phosphates are decreased in quan- tity in the urine, provided no food is taken. If food be taken, this diminution is not ob- served. Myelitis. In this disease the urine is of much the same character as in inflammation of the brain, viz. red, acid, thick, and containing a sediment. Cases are, however, recorded by Becquerel, in which the urine did not greatly vary from the natural standard. There appears no ex- cessive excretion of the phosphates in this disease, according to Dr. Jones's experiments. Bronchitis. All that we gather worthy of notice from the detailed examinations of Becquerel in respect to the state cf the urine in this dis- ease is, that it occasionally contains albumen. This may perhaps sometimes happen when great obstruction to the circulation of blood through the lungs has existed for any length * For the proper method of examining the urine in order to determine the presence or absence of albumen, I beg to refer to my work on Diseases of the Kidney connected with albuminous urine. of time. In by far the greater number of cases, however, no indication of this kind is found, unless the kidneys be predisposed to such form of disease as favours the effusion of serum. Pneumonia. In pneumonia the urea excreted is less than in health ; the uric acid is increased, the salts diminished, and the extractive matters increased, and more especially the alcoholic extract. The following are comparative analyses of the solid matters in 100 parts : — Urinp of Becquerel. Simon. health.

Uric acid was also thrown down on the addition of acids. This latter reaction, however, is not peculiar to this disease, I having myself often observed it in low forms of fever and also in small-pox. Heller relates the case of a boy in which the urine had the odour of hydrosulphateof ammonia, and deposited urate of soda. Pleuritis. In this disease the urine in general exhibits much the same characters as in pneumonia. Empyema. In cases of empyema the urine has been observed to contain pus by Schonlein and Simon. The empyema gradually disappeared, the urine containing albumen, and the deposit, when examined, showing the ordinary pus corpuscles. Hepatitis. In hepatitis the urine is extremely deficient in urea, according to Rose, who in one case believed it absent. Henry agrees in this opinion ; and Coindet states that, instead of urea, the urine contains a substance resembling bilin. Simon and Becquerel, however, differ from Rose and Henry, and mention a case of hepatitis in which urea was excreted in excess. Nephritis. In this disease, when it assumes the acute character, the urine is often bloody and very acid, and deposits the uric acid crystalline deposit. In arthritic nephritis the quantity of the uric acid crystals is sometimes ex- tremely great. In a case mentioned by Schon- lein the sediment occupied half the volume of the urine. Chronic Nephritis, Albuminous Nephri- tis, Morbus Brightii. In the morbus Brightii the urine contains abundance of albumen. Blood is occasionally observed in the early stages. It is generally acid, far less, frequently alkaline, and occasion-URINE. 1292 ally neutral. Its specific gravity is nearly always lower than that of health. The uric acid is usually in very small proportion, and sometimes altogether absent. This is not, however, always the case; and I have some- times seen the lithic acid in excess existing as a deposit. Simon believes albumen not unfrequently present in diseases quite uncon- nected with affections of the kidneys. His facts, however, are not satisfactorily stated, and I believe him to have been greatly mis- taken in this opinion. In connection with the morbus Brightii, we have to notice two substances which, according to Heller, are often present as deposits in that disease, viz. uroglaucin and urrhodin. These are colour- ing matters, derived by oxidation from uro- xanthin, or a yellow colouring matter of urine, which exists only in small proportion in healthy urine, but which is greatly increased in Bright's disease. The deposits observed in the morbus Brightii consist of the casts of the urinary tubules of the kidney — epi- thelium of two kinds, viz. spheroidal and pavement epithelium. ( Vide woodcut of urin- ary deposits, Jig. 799.) Cystitis. The urine in this disease is alkaline, the alkalinity increasing rapidly after the urine is voided, owing to the formation of carbonate of ammonia. Mucus and pus are present in quantity. Albumen can always be detected in solution when the pus corpuscles are pre- sent in the deposit. As cure is effecting, this albumen is found to decrease in propor- tion as the pus corpucles disappear. Tvphus. In typhus the urine shows no great va- riation from the normal standard, so far as specific gravity and amount of solid consti- tuents is concerned. The urea is generally in deficient proportion, the uric acid in- creased. The salts are much diminished. During the progress of typhus, the urine very generally becomes alkaline. Becquerel and Andral have made many experiments on the state of the urine both in typhus and typhoid fevers. They both have met with a large number of cases in which it was precipitable by nitric acid ; this is quite in accordance with my own observations ; the precipitate, how- ever, is lithic acid, and not albumen. Scherer found, like former observers, that the salts were much decreased in the urine of typhus, and that there was always an excess of uric acid. The following analyses are worthy of note. They were made by Scherer at the 9th, 12th, and 15th day of a slow nervous fever, which occurred in the person of a woman aged thirty- eight years. 9th Day. Water 945-48 Urea 8-60 Uric acid ....

The " salts so- luble in water" also diminished in quantity. Intermittent Fever. L'Heritier has made analyses of the urine in this disease, and has drawn up the follow- ing table, which represents its composition in the different stages, as deduced from a mean obtained from twelve cases.

Cholera. In this disease the urine is often altogether suppressed. When it can be collected in any quantity, its specific gravity is generally below the natural standard, and it has only a feeble acid reaction. Albumen is very often to be found it it. The urea is below the standard of health. Vogcl states that the urine, in a case of this disease which he examined, was entirely wanting in the salts of lime and mag- nesia, and that the chloride of sodium was deficient. The sulphates, however, were in larger proportion than in health. Albumen and biliary colouring matter could be detected by the appropriate tests. «URINE. I2!).'5 Rheumatism. In this disease the urine shows the usual appearances of the inflammatory type, accord- ing to Becquerel. Oxalate of lime not un- frequently exists as a deposit. Phthisis. In this disease the principal feature ob- served in the urine is the increase in the quantity of uric acid. One analysis gave as much as 240 of this acid in 1000 parts of urine. Struma. In struma, generally speaking, the urine is deficient in urea and uric acid. The phos- phates are often excreted in excess, and there is a tendency to the deposit of oxalate of lime. In mollities ossium and rachitis the earthy phosphates are excreted in very large quantity, the alkaline salts are increased, and the urea and uric acid diminished in proportion. The analyses which showed the above results were made on the urine of children, which always contains less urea and salts than that of adults. The following is an analysis, by Marchand, of the urine of a child suffering from mollities ossium. It was acid.

The urine in this disease contains a sugar which may be regarded as identical with sugar of grapes. It is generally of very high specific gravity, varying from the highest specific gravity observed in health to 1055 or even 1060. Schdnlein has an opinion that in the first stages of diabetes there is albumen in the urine, and that this becomes replaced by sugar. This opinion I scarcely can believe correct. The fact, indeed, could not well have escaped my notice, my attention having been parti- cularly directed to the study of albuminaria for some years past. The experiments of Kant have shown that urea is generally ex- creted in diabetes mellitus to the same amount as in health in the twenty-four hours. During the progress of the disease I have several times observed the whole of the sugar sud- denly disappear from the urine, and its place supplied by an enormous excretion of urea. I at first was inclined to regard this as a favourable indication, but experience has not confirmed that belief. Uric acid is |not un- commonly present in considerable quantity, and this I believe to be a favourable indication in diabetes. Simon has shown that the ab- solute quantity of urea excreted in twenty- four hours is occasionally diminished; but the general rule is that the quantity approaches that of health. Caseous matter is sometimes found in diabetic urine, and, when present, it excites rapid fermentation immediately after the urine is voided. Bouchardat has described a form of sugar which occasionally exists in diabetes, which is insipid, but which corresponds in every other respect with the sweet sugar. Simon says he once met with it. Lehmann, Ambrosiani, Midler, and Simon have observed the presence of hippuric acid in diabetic urine. Diabetes Insipidus. In this disease the urine contains an excess of water, and varies in specific gravity from 1001 to 1006. The urea, if regarded in pro- portion to the other solid matters excreted, is excessive in quantity, but the proportion discharged during the twenty-four hours is generally far below that of health. This excessive discharge of urea, as com- pared with the other solids, may be accom- panied by a less discharge of water than that which is generally found to accompany it. Then the urine attains a specific gravity ap- proaching that of health, and sometimes even exceeding it. Chemically, these two con- ditions so nearly approach, as scarcely to need division. Pathologically considered, however, the latter is the more serious form of disease, and is believed by some to be not an unfre- quent forerunner of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes Chylosus. This disease is characterised by the dis- charge of chyle in the urine. It is quite milky in appearance. A specimen I examined some few years ago yielded the following results: Specific gravity 1021. Acid in slight degree only. Milkiness, not changed from subsidence by standing. Agitated with ether the urine was cleared, and the ethereal solution, which then floated above, contained a fat, yielding an alkaline ash on incineration. This fat was not saponifiahle by boiling with a solution of potassa. The urine cleared from the fat coagulated by boil- ing, and also on the addition of nitric acid. Jaundice. The elements of bile exist in the urine in cases of jaundice. Simon has published the following result, obtained from the urine of a female, aged twenty, suffering from inflamma- tory icterus. The urine was brownish red, and of specific gravity 1020, and very acid.

Scherer examined urine obtained from a person labouring under long-continued icterus, dependent on chronic inflammation of the hepatic structure. On emission this urine was clear, yellow, and perfectly neutral: it subsequently became acid, and deposited uric acid and bile pigment. This acidity Scherer believes was owing to the development of lactic acid. The specific gravity of the specimen was 1018 ; 1000 parts yielded 4'3 of urea only, and as much as l-8 of uric acid. Silica was also found in this urine. Urine of Pregnancy. The urine of pregnant women often con- tains a peculiar substance, to which the name of kystein has been given. It appears as a white scum when the urine has stood some hours. I have frequently found this substance in urine at the third and fourth months of gesta- tion, and have no doubt that its appearance is closely connected with the phenomenon of the secretion of milk. In several instances I succeeded in detecting distinct milk globules in such urine. Foreign Substances in the Urine. Medicines, and substances taken for food, are occasionally found in the urine. Some of these, however, undergo changes in the organ- ism before they are excreted by the kidneys. Simon has classified these bodies; and I shall here enumerate them according to his arrangement. Inorganic non-metallic bodies. — Iodine, bromine, chlorine, sulphur *, iodide of potas- sium, alkaline borates, silicates, chlorates, and carbonates, chloride of barium, ferridcyanide of potassium, sulphocyanide of potassium. The ferridcyanide was converted, however, into the ferrocyanide in the system. Metallic substances. — Arsenic, antimony, iron, nickel, gold, silver, tin, lead, bismuth, copper, and manganese. I have sought in vain for mercury in the urine. Lehmann and LTIeritier have also failed to find it where it has been largely exhibited. Several chemists, however, declare they have detected it. Inorganic acids. — Nitric f, hydrochloric, and sulphuric. Organic acids. — Oxalic, citric, malic, tar- taric, succinic, gallic, and acetic. Pereira has succeeded in detecting meconic acid in the urine of animals poisoned by opium. Vegetable bases. —Quina, morphia. Indifferent organic substances. — Colouring matters of indigo, gamboge, rhubarb, red beet- root, madder, logwood, mulberries, black cherries; odorous principles of valerian, * This, if exhibited in combination in sulphurets, is excreted as sulphate of the base. \ Dr. Bence Jones believes that nitric acid is com- monly present in healthy urine, and appears as the result of the oxidation of nitrogenised food. assafcetida, garlic, eastoreum, saffron, turpen- tine. Liebig and Wohler both state that alcohol cannot be detected in the urine. Percy, how- ever, has proved that it can. Dr. Wright has corroborated Percy's experiments, and ob- tained alcohol by the same plan of analysis. Lehmann and others sought unsuccessfully for the following substances in the urine : viz., salicin, phloridzin, caffein, theobromin, as- paragin, and amygdalin. These substances probably undergo changes in the organism. Leh mann has shown that salicin becomes converted into salicylous acid ; this was taken up by ether with the oxide of omichmyle. The addition of nitrate of iron produced the fine violet colour characteristic of salicylous acid. Hippuric acid and oxalate of lime were also produced. Phloridzin is converted into oxalic and hippuric acids during its passage through the organism, according to Lehmann. For the Bibliography reference is made to the works of Berzelius, Prout, Simon, Liebig, Dumas, Lehmann, on Animal Chemistry, and to those quoted in the foot notes. (G. Owen Reesi) VARIETIES OF MANKIND.—Under this head it is intended to give a general ac- count of the distinctive characters, — struc- tural, physiological, and psychological — of the principal Races of Men ; and to inquire into the nature and degree of their mutual affinity. Before entering upon these subjects, however, it will be desirable, in the first place, to set forth the most important characters by which Man, under whatever form, is distin- guished from the Mammalia which approach most nearly to him ; and, secondly, to lay a foundation in the recognised principles of natural history and physiology, for a true ap- preciation of the characters which serve to distinguish sjiecies from each other, as con- trasted with those which may be presented by varieties, whose original stock is known, or believed, to have been identical. I. Distinctive Characteristics of Man. By Cuvier and nearly all modern zoologists, the various races of mankind are included under one genus, Homo; and this genus takes rank, in the classification of Mam- malia, as a distinct order, Bur ana, of which it is the sole representative. Of all the cha- racters which distinguish Man from the in- ferior Mammalia, the possession of two hands is doubtless the most easily recognised, and at the same time the most intimately related to the general organisation of the body; and there is none, therefore, which could be more appropriately selected as the basis of a dis- tinctive designation for this order. At first sight it might be considered that the pos- session of only two hands, whilst Apes and Monkeys and their allies are designated as possessing four, is a character of inferiority ; but such is not really the case ; for noneVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1295 of these four hands are adapted to the va- riety of actions of which those of man are capable, and they are all in some degree re- quired for support; so that whilst in the higher forms of the Quadrumanous order, the extremities present a certain approximation in structure to those of man, in the lower they gradually assimilate to the ordinary quadrupedal type. " That," says Cuvier, " which constitutes the hand, properly so called, is the faculty of opposing the thumb to the other fingers, so as to seize upon the most minute objects ; a faculty which is car- ried to its highest degree of perfection in Man, in whom the whole anterior extremity is free, and can be employed in prehension." The peculiar prehensile power possessed by man is chiefly dependent upon the size and power of the thumb ; which is more developed in Man than it is in the highest apes. The thumb of the human hand can be brought into exact opposition to the extremities of all the fingers, whether singly or in combination ; whilst in those Quadrumana which most nearly ap- proach man, the thumb is so short, and the fingers so much elongated, that their tips can scarcely be brought into opposition ; and the thumb and fingers are so weak, that they can never be opposed to each other with any de- gree of force. Hence, although admirably adapted for clinging round bodies of a certain size, such as the small branches of trees, &c., the extremities of the Quadrumana can nei- ther seize very minute objects with such pre- cision, nor support large ones with such firmness, as are essential to the dexterous per- formance of a variety of operations, for which the hand of Man is admirably adapted. There is much truth, then, in Sir C. Bell's remark, that "we ought to define the hand as belong- ing exclusively to man." There is in him, what we observe in none of the Mammalia which approach him in other respects, a com- plete distinction in the functional character of the anterior and posterior extremities ; the former being adapted for prehension alone, and the latter for support and progression alone; and thus each function is performed in a much higher degree of perfection, than it can be when two such opposite purposes have to be united. For not only is the hand of man a much more perfect prehensile in- strument than that of the orang or chim- panzee, but his foot is a much more perfect organ of support and progression than theirs, being adapted to maintain his body in an erect position, alike during rest and whilst in motion, — an attitude which even the roost anthropoid apes can only sustain for a short time, and with an obvious effort. The arm of the higher apes has as wide a range of motion as that of man, so far as its articu- lation is concerned ; but it is only when the animal is in the erect attitude, that the limb can have free play. Thus the structure of the whole frame must be conformable to that of the hand, in the way that we find it to be in man, in order that this organ may be advan- tageously applied to the purposes which it is adapted to perform. But it cannot be said with truth (as some have maintained) that Man owes his superiority to his hand alone ; for without the mind by which it is directed, and the senses by which its operations are guided, it would be a comparatively valueless in- strument. Man's elevated position is due to the superiority of his mind and of its ma- terial instruments conjointly ; for if destitute of either, the human race must be speedily ex- tinguished altogether, or reduced to a very subordinate grade of existence. The next series of characters to be con- sidered, are those by which man is adapted to the erect attitude. On examining his cra- nium, we remark that the occipital condyles are so placed, that a perpendicular dropped from the centre of gravity of the head would nearly fall between them, so as to be within the base on which it rests upon the spinal column. The foramen magnum is not placed in the centre of the skull, but just behind it; so that the greater specific gravity of the pos- terior part of the head, which is entirely filled with solid mattcr,iscompensated by the greater length of the anterior part, which contains many cavities. There is, indeed, a little over- compensation, which gives a slight prepon- derance to the front of the head, so that it drops forwards and downwards, when all the muscles are relaxed; but the muscles which are attached to the occiput are larger and far more numerous than those in front of the condyles, so that they are evidently intended to counteract this disposition; and we find, accordingly, that we can keep up the head for a whole day, with so slight and involuntary effort, that no fatigue is produced by it. More- over, the plane of the foramen magnum, and the surfaces of the condyles, have a nearly horizontal direction when the head is upright ; and thus the weight of the skull is laid verti- cally upon the top of the vertebral column. If these arrangements be compared with those which prevail in other Mammalia, it will be found that the foramen and condyles are placed in the latter much nearer the back of the head, and that their plane is more oblique. Thus, whilst the foramen magnum is situated, in Man, just behind the centre of the base of the skull, it is found in the Chimpanzee and Orang to occupy the middle of the poste- rior third ; and as we descend through the scale of Mammalia, we observe that it gra- dually approaches the back of the skull, and at last comes nearly into the line of its longest diameter, as we see in the Horse. So the angle of inclination which the condyles make with the horizontal is very small in Man, but rises in the Orang to 37° ; whilst in the Horse their plane is vertical, making the angle 90°. If, therefore, the natural posture of man had been horizontal, the plane of his condyles would be brought, like that of the horse, into the vertical position ; and the head, instead of being nearly balanced upon the summit of the vertebral column, would hang at the end of the neck, so that its whole weight would have to be supported by someVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1296 external and constantly-acting power. But for this there is neither in the skeleton, the ligamentous apparatus, nor the muscular sys- tem of Man, any adequate provision ; so that in any other than the vertical position, his head, which is relatively heavier than that of most Mammalia, would be supported with more difficulty and effort than it is in any other animal. The position of the face immediately be- neath the anterior portion of the cranial cavity, so that its front is nearly in the same plane as the forehead, is peculiarly character- istic of Man ; for the crania of the Chimpanzee and Orang, which approach most nearly to that of man, are entirely posterior to, not above, the face (see Jigs. 800—802.). It should be remarked that in the young ape, there is a much greater resemblance to man in this re- spect, than there is in the adult; for it is at the time of the second dentition, that the muzzle of the ape acquires its peculiar elonga- tion and consequent projection in front of the forehead ; and the whole cast of the features is altered at the same time, so as to approxi- mate much more closely to that of the lower Quadrumana than would have been thought likely from the inspection of the young ani- mal only. This projection of the muzzle, taken in connection with the obliquity of the condyles, is another evidence of want of adaptation to the erect posture; whilst the want of prominence in the face of Man shows that none but the erect position can be natural to him. For supposing that with a head formed and situated as at pre- sent, he were to move upon all fours, his face would be brought into a plane parallel with the ground ; so that as painful an effort would be required to examine with the eyes an object placed in front of the body, as is now necessary to keep the eyes fixed on the zenith ; the nose would then be almost inca- pacitated for receiving any other odorous emanations, than those proceeding from the earth or from the body itself; and the mouth could not touch the ground, without bringing the forehead and chin also in contact with it. The obliquity of the eomtyles in the Qua- drumana enables them without much difficulty to adapt the inclination of their heads either to the horizontal or to the erect posture; but the natural position, in the highest among them, is unquestionably one in which the spinal column is inclined, the body being par- tially thrown forwards, so as to rest upon the anterior extremities ; and in this position, the face is directed forwards without any effort. The vertebral column in Man, although not absolutely straight, has its curves so arranged, that when the body is in the erect posture, a vertical line from its summit would fall exactly on the centre of its base. It increases con- siderably in size in the lumbar region, so as to be altogether somewhat pyramidal in its form. The lumbar portion, in the chim- panzee and orang, is by no means of the same proportional strength, and contains but four vertebrae instead of five. The processes for the attachment of the dorso-spinal muscles to this part, are peculiarly large and strong in man ; and this arrangement is obviously adapted to overcome the tendency, which the weight of the trunk in front of' the column would have to draw it forwards and down- wards. On the other hand, the spinous pro- cesses of the cervical and dorsal vertebra;, which in other Mammalia are large and strong, for the attachment of the ligaments and muscles that support the head, have compara- tively little prominence in man, whose head is balanced upon the summit of the column. The base of the human vertebral column is placed on a sacrum of greater proportional breadth than that of any other animal ; this sacrum is fixed between two widely expanded ilia; and the whole pelvis is thus peculiarly broad. In this manner the fe- moral articulations are thrown very far apart, so as to give a wide basis of' support ; and by the oblique direction of the axis of the pelvis, the weight of the body is trans- mitted almost vertically from the top of the sacrum to the upper part of the thigh bones. The pelvis of the anthropoid apes is very differently constructed. That of the orang, for example, is much longer and narrower ; its alas extend upwards rather than outwards, so that the space between the lowest ribs anil the crest of the iliac bones is much less than in man; their surfaces are nearly parallel to that of the sacrum, which is itself longer and narrower; and the axis of the pelvis is nearly parallel with that of the verte- bral column. The position of the human femur, in which its head is most securely retained in its deep acetabulum, is that which it has when supporting the body in the erect attitude; in the chimpanzee and orang, its analogous position is at an oblique angle to the long axis of the pelvis, so that the body leans forwards in front of it; in many of the four-footed Mammalia, as the elephant, it makes a right angle with the vertebral column ; and in several others, as the horse, ox, &c, the angle which it makes with the axis of the pelvis and vertebral column is acute. In this respect, then, the skeleton of man presents an adaptation to the erect pos- ture, which is exhibited by that of no other mammal. The lotver extremities of Man are remark- able for their length, which is proportionally greater than that which we find in any other mammalia, excepting the kangaroo and a few other leaping animals. The chief difference in their proportional length, between man and the semi-erect apes, is seen in the thigh ; and from the relative length of this part in him, and the comparative shortness of his anterior extremities, it happens that the hands of Man, when he is standing erect, only reach to the middle of his thighs, whilst in the Chimpanzee they hang on a level with the knees, and in the Orang they descend to the ancles. The human femur is distinguished by its form and position, as well as by its length. The obli- quity of its neck still further increases the1297 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. breadth of the hips; whilst it causes the lower extremities of the femora to be some- what obliquely directed towards each other, so that the knees are brought more nearly into the line of the axis of the body. This arrangement is of the greatest importance in facilitating the purely biped progression of Man, in which the entire weight of the body must be alternately supported upon each limb; for if the knees had been kept further apart, the whole body must have been swung from side to side at each step, so as to bring the centre of gravity over each tibia, — as is seen, to a certain extent, in the female sex, whose walk, owing to the greater breadth of the pelvis, and the separation between the knees, is less steady than that of the male. There is a very marked contrast between the knee-joint of Man, and that of even the high- est Apes. In the former the opposed extre- mities of the femur and tibia are so expanded as to present a very broad articulating sur- face ; and the internal condyle of the femur being the longer of the two, they arein the same horizontal plane in the usual oblique position of that bone; so that by this arrangement the whole weight of the body, in its erect posture, falls vertically on the head of the tibia, when the joint is in the firmest posi- tion in which it can be placed. The knee- joint of the Orang, on the other hand, is comparatively deficient in extent of articu- lating surface ; and its whole conformation indicates that it is not intended to serve as more than a partial support. The human foot is, in proportion to the size of the whole body, larger, broader, and stronger than that of any other existing mammal, save the kan- garoo. Its plane is directed at right angles to that of the leg ; and its sole is concave, so that the whole weight of the body falls on the summit of an arch, of which the os calcis and the metatarsal bones form the two points of support. This arched form of the foot, and the habitual contact of the os calcis with the ground, are peculiar to Man alone. All the apes have the os calcis small, straight, and more or less raised from the ground, which they touch, when standing erect, with the outer side of the foot only ; whilst in animals more remote from man, the os calcis is brought still more into the line of the tibia ; and the foot being more elongated and nar- rowed, only the extremities of the toes come in contact with the ground. Hence Man is the only species of mammal which can stand on one leg. The points in which the feet of the anthropoid apes differ from his, all assi- milate them to the manual type of conforma- tion, and enable them to serve as more efficient prehensile organs, whilst they diminish their capacity to sustain the weight of the body when it simply rests upon them. There is a considerable difference in the form of the trunk, between Man and most other mammalia ; for his thorax is expanded laterally, and flattened in front, so as to pre- vent the centre of gravity from being carried too far forwards. His sternum is short and VOL. IV. broad compared with that of quadrupeds generally; and there is consequently a con- siderable space between its lower extremity and the symphysis pubis, occupied solely by muscular parts, which would be quite inade- quate to sustain the weight of the viscera, if the habitual position of the trunk had been horizontal. In these particulars, however, the most anthropoid Apes agree with Man. Returning now to the skull for a more minute examination, and referring to the ar- ticle Quad rum an a for an account of the principal differences presented between the skulls of the ordinary Chimpanzee and Orang, and that of Man, we shall take as our standard of comparison the recently-discovered species of Chimpanzee, designated as the Troglodytes gorilla, whose cranium is considered by Prof. Owen to approach in some respects more nearly to that of man, than do either of the preceding. This species differs from the T. niger (Simla troglodytes, Vrolik) by its con- siderably greater dimensions, by the greater prominence of the supra-orbital ridges, the enormous development of the crest, which oc- cupies the place of the sagittal suture, the greater strength of the zygomatic arches, and the greater size of the temporal fossa. For the more minute, but definite cha- racters, on which the specific distinction is grounded, the description by Prof. Owen must be consulted.* The slightest glance at Jigs. 800, 801, 802. is sufficient to show how strongly marked are the features by which the skull of this Chimpanzee differs from that of even the most degraded of the Human family ; but it will be advantageous to sub- join Prof. Owen's enumeration of the chief differences which are revealed by a careful anatomical survev. These are : — " 1. The smaller proportional size of the cranium. " 2. The more backward position of the foramen magnum, and its more oblique plane in relation to that of the base of the skull. " 3. The smaller relative size, and more backward position, of the occipital condyles. " 4. The longer basi-occipital, and broader, flatter, and lower supra-occipital. " 5. The longer basisphenoid, and shorter alisphenoids. " 6. The smaller size of the coalesced pa- rietals, and their separation from the alisphe- noids. " 7. The conversion of a greater part of the outer surface of the parietals into con- cavities or depressions for the lodgment ot the temporal muscles, by reason of the bony crest developed from the line of the obliterated sagittal suture, and of the lambdoidal crest. " 8. The larger proportion of this crest and of the squamosal plate developed from the mastoid, and the smaller size of the proper mastoid processes. " 9. The smaller size of the vaginal and styliform processes, and the absence of the * Transactions of the Zoological Society, vol. iii. p. 392. et seq. 4e O1298 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. styloid process, arising from the non-anchy- losis of the stylo-hyal bone.

The larger post-glenoid process, and the longer auditory process (tympanic bone), with their relative position, one behind, but not below, the other. "11. The position of the stronger zygo- mata opposite the middle third of the basis cranii. " 12. The prominent supra-orbital ridge. " 13. The longer nasal bones, anchylosed together, and flattened at their lower half. " 14. The greater proportional size, and greater prominence of the upper and lower jaws. " 15. The longer osseous palate, and the median emargination of its posterior border. " 16. The parallelism of the alveoli of the molars and canine of one side, with those of the other. " 17. The diastema, or vacant place, in front of the socket of the canine in the upper jaw, and behind that socket in the lower jaw. " 18. The larger and more produced pre- maxillaries, the persistence of more or less of their sutures, showing the intervention of their upper extremities between the nasal and maxillary bones. " 19. The minor extent of connection of the lachrymal with the 'pars plana' of the aethmoid, or their separation by the junction of the orbital plate of the maxillary with that of the frontal behind the lachrymal. " 20. The depth of the olfactory fossa, and the absence or rudimental state of the crista galli. " 21. The squamosal, lambdoidal, alisphe- noidal and pterygoid air-cells. " 22. The more prominent cusps of the molar teeth. " 23. The larger relative size, and more complex grinding surface of the last molar tooth in both jaws. " 24. The larger relative size of the pre- molars, especially of the first. " 25. The more complex implantation of the premolars by three roots, two external and one internal. " 26. The much larger and longer canines. " 27. The sexual distinction in the develop- ment of these teeth. " 28. The more sloping position of the crowns of the incisors. " 29. The broader and higher ascending ramus of the lower jaw. " 30. The total absence of the prominence of the symphysis forming the chin. " In the form of the premaxillaries, and the earlier obliteration of their sutures," Prof. Owen continues, " the smaller chimpanzee more nearly resembles man than the great gorilla does; it seems also to deviate less through the minor development of the canine teeth, and of the parietal and sagittal crests ; but it has been shown, in the comparison of the skulls of Troglodytes gorilla and T. niger, that the latter departs in more numerous and important particulars further from the human type." _ Now, of the foregoing characters, some of those which constitute the most striking fea- tures in the cranium of the Chimpanzee, are those which must be admitted from analogy to be liable to variation under the influence1299 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 4 o 2 of a change of habits, provided such change could be induced. Thus vve find that in dogs, the general form of the cranium, and the sagittal crest, undergo considerable modifica- tion ; the brain acquiring a very large size, in several of the domesticated races, at an early period of life ; and the parietal bones being expanded over it so as to form a smooth dome, instead of rising up to meet in a ver- tical ridge. But the prominence of the supra- orbital ridge does not seem to be in any way connected with the relative development of the cerebrum and of the muscular system ; and as Prof. Owen remarks, " We have no grounds from observation or experiment to believe the absence or the presence of a pro- minent supra-orbital ridge to be a modifiable character, or one to be gained or lost through the operation of external causes, inducing particular habits through successive genera- tions of a species. It may be concluded, therefore, that such feeble indication of the supra-orbital ridge, aided by the expansion of the frontal sinuses, as exists in man, is as much a specific peculiarity of the human skull, in the present comparison, as the ex- aggeration or suppression of this ridge is respectively characteristic of the chimpanzees and orangs." The same may be said of nearly all the other distinctive characters which have been so minutely enumerated ; for they serve to distinguish the great chimpanzee from all the varieties of the human race, — from the most degraded African, as well as from the most elevated European. The shape, size, and construction of the " pre- maxillary " bones (" inter-maxillaries " of the ordinary nomenclature) are peculiarly distinc- tive ; for they not only differ from those of Man in their vastly greater proportional size, their greater prominence, and the longer per- sistence of their sutures, but also in their upward extension around the nostrils, so that they completely exclude the maxillary bones from their borders, and form the bases of support for the nasal bones (7%. 800.) It is to be remembered that the apparent defi- ciency ofthe inter-maxillary bone in the human subject is the result of its early coalescence with the maxillary ; anil that this coalescence may be prevented by an arrest of development, so that the two bones remain permanently distinct.* Having dwelt thus fully on the distinctive features of the Osteology of Man, it will be sufficient to pass over his other peculiarities of conformation more cursorily, referring to the article Quadrumana for more minute details. In his A'lyology, the most charac- teristic difference is the much greater de- velopment of those muscles of the trunk and limbs, which contribute to the maintenance of the erect posture. Thus the gastrocnemii and the other muscles which tend to keep the leg erect upon the foot, form a much * A very definite account of the early embryonic state of the intermaxillary bone, is given by Dr. Leidy in the Proceedings of the Academy of the Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for 1848. more prominent " calf" than is seen in any other animal. So, again, the extensors of the leg upon the thigh are much more powerful than the flexors ; a character which is pecu- liar to man. The glutaei, by which the pelvis is kept erect upon the thigh, are of far greater size than is elsewhere seen. The superior power of the muscles tending to draw the head and spine backwards, has been already referred to. Among the differences in the attachment of individual muscles, we may no- tice that the flexor longus pollicis pedis pro- ceeds in man to the great toe alone, on which the weight of the body is often supported ; whilst it is attached in the chimpanzee and orang to the three middle toes. The latissi- mus dorsi of man is destitute of that pro- longation attached to the olecranon, which is found in most of the lower Mammalia, and which exists even in the chimpanzee, pro- bably giving assistance in its climbing movements. The larger size of the muscles of the thumb is, as might be expected, a characteristic of the hand of man, though the number of muscles by which that digit is moved is the same in the chimpanzee as in the human subject. The existence of the extensor digiti indicis, as a distinct muscle, however, is peculiar to man. The visceral apparatus of Man presents very few characteristic peculiarities, by which it can be distinguished from that of the higher Quadrumana ; among the most re- markable is the absence of the laryngeal pouches, which exist even in the chimpanzee and orang-outan, as dilatations of the laryngeal ventricles. Of the anatomy of the last-named animals in their adult condition, however, we know as yet too little, to enable its resem- blance to that of man to be confidently pro- nounced upon. The conformation of the brain of Man does not differ so much from that of the chimpanzee and orang, as the superiority of his mental endowments might have led us to anticipate. The following are the principal differences which it seems to present:— 1. The mass of the entire brain is considerably larger in proportion to that of the body, and in proportion also to the diameter of the nerves which are connected with it. 2. In the external configuration of the cerebrum, we notice that the posterior lobes are more developed, so as to project further beyond the cerebellum than they do in any of the quadrumana ; the convolutions are more nu- merous, and the sulci are deeper. 3. On ex- amining the internal structure, it is found that the peripheral layer of grey matter is thicker, the corpus callosum extends further backwards, and the posterior cornua of the lateral ventricles are relatively longer and larger than they are in any Quadrumana. 4. The cerebellum, also, is proportionally larger. — The great size of the cranial portion of the skull in Man, as compared with the facial, produces a marked difference between his facial angle, and that of even the highest Quadrumana. According to Camper, who first1300 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. applied this method of measurement, the facial angle of the average of European skulls is 80°, whilst in the ideal heads of the Grecian gods it is increased to 90° ; on the other hand, in the skull of a Kalmuck he found it to be 75°, and in that of a Negro only 70° ; and applying the same system of measure- ment to the skulls of Apes, he found them to range from 64° to 60°. But these last mea- surements were all taken from young skulls, in which the forward extension of the jaws, which takes place on the second dentition, had not yet occurred. In the adult Chim- panzee, as we learn from the measurements of Prof. Owen, the facial angle is no more than 35°, and in the adult Orang only 30°; so that instead of the Negro being nearer to the Ape than to the European, as Camper's estimate would make him, the interval be- tween the most degraded human races and the most elevated Quadrumana is vastly greater than between the highest and lowest forms of humanity. It must be borne in mind that the facial angle is so much affected by the degree of prominence of the jaws, that it can never afford any certain information con- cerning the elevation of the forehead and the capacity of the cranium ; all that it can in any degree serve to indicate, is the relative proportion between the facial and cranial parts of the skull. The small size of the face of Man, compared with that of the cranium, is an indication that in him the senses are sub- ordinated to the intelligence. Accordingly we find that he is surpassed by many of the lower animals in acuteness of sensibility to light, sound, &c. ; but he stands preeminent in the power of comparing and judging of his sensations, and of drawing conclusions from them as to their objective sources. Moreover, although none of his senses are very acute in his natural state, they are all moderately so ; and they are capable of being wonderfully improved by practice, when cir- cumstances strongly call for their exercise. This seems especially the case with the tactile sense (see article Touch, p. 1177), of which man can make greater use than any other animal, in consequence of the entire freedom of his anterior extremities, although there are many which surpass him in their power of appreciating certain classes of tactile impres- sions. So, again, Man's nervo-inuscular power is inferior to that of most other animals of his size; the full grown Orang, for example, surpasses him both in strength and agility ; and the larger Chimpanzee, according to the statements of the negroes who have en- countered it, is far more than a match for any single man, and is almost certain to destroy any human opponent when once within his grasp. The absence of any natural weapons of offence, and of direct means of defence, are remarkable characteristics of Man, and dis- tinguish him not only from the lower Mam- malia, but also from the most anthropoid Apes ; in which it is obvious (both from their habits and general organisation) that the enormous canines have no relation to a car- nivorous regimen, but are instruments of war- fare. On those animals to which nature has denied weapons of attack, she has bestowed the means either of passive defence, of con- cealment, or of flight; in each of which Man is deficient. Yet, by his superior reason, he has not only been enabled to resist the at- tacks of other animals, but even to bring them into subjection to himself. His intellect can scarcely suggest the mechanism which his hands cannot frame ; and he has devised and constructed arms more powerful than those which any other creature wields, and defences so secure as to defy the assaults of all but his fellow men. The power of adaptation to varieties in external condition, which renders Man to a great extent independent of them, is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of his economy. He is capable of sustaining the lowest as well as the highest extremes of temperature and of atmospheric pressure. In the former of these particulars he is strikingly contrasted with the anthropoid apes; the Chimpanzee being restricted to the hottest parts of Africa, and the Orang outan to the tropical portions of the Indian Archipelago*; and neither of these animals being capable of living in temperate climates without the assistance of artificial heat, even with the aid of which they have not hitherto survived their second dentition. So, again, although Man's diet seems naturally of a mixed character, he can support himself in health and strength either on an exclusively vegetable diet, or, under particular circumstances, on an almost exclusively animal diet. It is in thus adapt- ing himself to the conditions of his existence, in providing himself with food, shelter, wea- pons of attack and defence, &c, that man's intellectual powers are first called into active operation; and when thus aroused, their development has no assignable limit. The will, guided by the intelligence, and acted on by the desires and emotions, takes the place in man of the instinctive propensities which are the usual springs of action in the lower animals ; and although, among the most ele- vated of these, the intelligent will is called into exercise to a certain extent, yet it never acquires among them, the dominance which it possesses in man. The capacity for intel- lectual progress is a remarkable peculiarity of man's psychical nature. The instinctive habits of the lower animals are limited, and peculiar to each species, and have immediate reference to their bodily wants. Where a particular adaptation of means to ends, of actions to circumstances, is made by an indi- vidual (as is frequently the case, when some amount of intelligence or rationality exists), the rest do not seem to profit by it ; so that, although (as will be shown hereafter) the in- stincts of particular animals may be modified by the training of man, or by the education of circumstances, so as to show themselves after a few generations under new forms, no elevation in intelligence appears ever to take place spontaneously, no psychical im-1301 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. provement is manifested in the species at large. One of the most important aids in the use and development of the human mind, is the capacity for articulate speech; of which, so far as we know, man is the only animal in possession. There is no doubt that many other species have certain powers of com- munication between individuals; but these are probably very limited, and of a kind more allied to the " language of signs," than to a proper verbal language. In fact it is obvious that the use of a language composed of a cer- certain number of distinct sounds, combined into words in a multitude of different modes, requires a certain degree of that power of abstraction and generalisation, in which (as elsewhere remarked*) it appears that the lower animals are altogether deficient. The correspondence between the psychical endow- ments of the Chimpanzee and those of the Human infant before it begins to speak, is extremely close ; and those who have perused the interesting narrative given by Dr. Howe, of his successful training of Laura Bridgeman, will remember how marked was the improve- ment in her mental condition, from the time when she first apprehended the idea that she could give such expression to her thoughts, feelings and desires, as should secure their being comprehended by others. Now, this capacity for progress is con- nected with another element in Man's nature, which it is difficult to isolate and define, but which interpenetrates and blends with his whole psychical character. " The soul," it has been remarked, "is that side of our nature which is in relation with the infinite ;" and it is the existence of this relation, in whatever way we may describe it, which seems to con- stitute the most distinctive peculiarity of man. It is in the desire for an improvement in his condition, occasioned by an aspiration after something nobler and purer, that the main- spring of human progress may be said to lie; among the lovvest races of mankind, the capa- city exists, but the desire seems dormant. When once thoroughly awakened, however, it seems to " grow by what it feeds on ;" and the advance once commenced, little external stimulus is needed; for the desire increases at least as fast as the capacity. In the higher grades of mental development, there is a con- tinual looking upwards, not (as in the lower) towards a more elevated human standard, but at once to something beyond and above man and material nature. This seems the chief source of the tendency to believe in some unseen existence ; which may take various forms, but seems never entirely absent from any race or nation, although, like other innate tendencies, it may be deficient in individuals. Attempts have been made by some travellers to prove that particular nations are destitute of it ; but such assertions have been based only upon a limited acquaintance with their habits of thought, and with their outward observances ; for there are probably none * See Art. Instinct, vol. iii. p. 2. who do not possess the idea of some invisible power, external to themselves, whose favour they seek, and whose anger they deprecate, by sacrifice and other ceremonials. It re- quires a higher mental cultivation than is commonly met with, to conceive of this power as having a spiritual existence ; but wherever the idea of spirituality can be de- fined, it seems connected with it. The vulgar readiness to believe in demons, ghosts, &c. is only an irregular or depraved manifestation of the same tendency. Closely connected with it, is the desire to participate in this spiritual existence, which has been implanted in the mind of man, and which, developed as it is by the mental cultivation that is almost necessary for the formation of the idea, has been regarded by philosophers in all ages as one of the chief natural arguments for the immortality of the soul. By this immortal soul, Man is connected with that higher order of being, in which Intelligence exists, un- restrained in its exercise by the imperfections of that corporeal mechanism through which it here operates; and to this state, — a state of more intimate communion of mind with mind, and of creatures with their Creator, — he is encouraged to aspire, as the reward of his improvement of the talents here committed to his charge. II. Of Species and Varieties, zoologi- cally CONSIDERED. The meaning which the scientific Na- turalist attaches to the term Species, is not always defined in the same manner, although the notions which the various definitions are intended to convey, are for the most part essentially similar. Thus a species has been described as " a race of animals or of plants, marked by any peculiar character which has always been constant and undeviating ;" it being obvious, from this definition, which carries us backwards from the present to the past, that the first parents or " protoplasts " of such a race must have been distinguished by the same characters as those by which their descendants are now recognised. But, again, this community of parentage is made by Cuvier to constitute the leading idea con- veyed by the term ; for he defines a species to be " the collection of all the beings de- scended the one from the other, or from com- mon parents ; and of those which bear as close a resemblance to these, as they bear to each other." "We are under the necessity," he elsewhere remarks, " of admitting the exist- ence of certain forms, which have perpetuated themselves from the beginning of the world, without exceeding the limits first prescribed ; all the individuals belonging to one of these forms, constitute what is termed a species." And M. De Candolle, in like manner, ob- serves that " we unite, under the designation of a species, all those individuals which mu- tually bear to each other so close a resem- blance, as to allow of our supposing that they may have proceeded originally from a single 4 o 3VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1302 being or a single pair." Thus it appears that, in one mode or another, the fundamental idea of the term, among all those naturalists who admit the " permanence of species," con- nects itself with the notion of community of descent. This notion, as M. De Candolle admits, is hypothetical, so far at least as its particular applications are concerned ; since in no one case have we the power either of looking back to the epoch of the first pro- duction of a species, or of tracing downwards the whole line of descent from any original pair. Still, as it is the only definition which conveys the essence of what naturalists or- dinarily mean by species, we shall accept it as the basis of our further inquiries ; and shall now point out the mode, in which it is brought into application in the actual study of natural history. We will suppose the Zoologist to have two new specimens of shells or insects placed before him, or the Botanist to be examining two new specimens of plants. If the con- formity between the two is so extremely close, that the differences do not exceed the limits of variation which are commonly seen to prevail in the offspring of a common parentage, he places them in the same species ; because he considers that each may produce a form resembling the other, or may have been pro- duced by it, so that there is no sufficient ground for assigning to the two a distinct ancestry. But supposing that the differences should be more strongly marked, and the naturalist should be tempted to assign dif- ferent specific names to his two shells, or insects, or plants : in what way is he to diag- nose their similarity or diversity of origin ? He forms his judgment, in the first place, by the nature of the characteristic difference ; for this may be of such a kind, that its variability could not be reasonably suspected. Yet this is not a point on which much stress can be laid, when it stands alone; for although in many groups there are certain characters which present such constancy, that a pre- sumption of specific diversity may be fairly entertained if these should exhibit well-marked differences, yet there are too many exceptions to allow such differences to be unhesitatingly admitted as valid specific characters. They may arise, in fact, from three sets of causes; namely, differences in age and degree of de- velopment, differences in the conditions under which the individuals have existed, and tend- ency to spontaneous variation inherent in the race. It is necessary, therefore, to ex- clude each of these possible sources of error, before the specific diversity of our two objects can be established. 1. It is now universally admitted that the cases are extremely numerous, in which diver- sities of age have led to the establishment of species which have no existence in nature ; the forms thus distinguished being those of the same species in different grades of de- velopment. The more our knowledge of the history of the lower tribes of animals in- creases, the ffiore is it found that metamor- phosis is with them the rule, and not the ex- ception ; so that the cases seem comparatively rare, in which an invertebrated animal at its emersion from the egg possesses the cha- racters that serve to distinguish it in its adult condition. And just as the larva, pupa, and imago states of any insect, are all compre- hended in a complete account of the species, so must we rank the extraordinary diversities of form presented by the Medusa or the Balani, in the early period of their lives, as coming within the limits of their specific definitions. It is obvious that this source of fallacy can only be completely avoided, when we have obtained an acquaintance with the whole his- tory of the life of any individual, from its com- mencement to its dissolution, and are thus enabled to say positively what are, and what are not, alterations producible by age. Where this knowledge cannot be acquired, the only safe basis on which the naturalist can pro- ceed, is that which is derived from a know- ledge of these phenomena as presented in the most nearly allied forms; and yet this often fails, as in the case of the Astacus jiuvia- tilis (river cray-fish), and Gecarcinus (land crab), which undergo no change that can be called a metamorphosis, notwithstanding that in all other Macrourous and Brachyourous Decapods yet observed, a real metamorphosis takes place. Even in the case of extinct species, the history of whose life can never become known to us by any other means than by the preservation of their remains in different stages of growth, the careful com- parison of a sufficient series of these remains will sometimes establish a strong probability, if not a positive certainty, as to their mutual relationship : thus, M. Barrande, of Prague, has succeeded in showing that it is next to certain that no fewer than eighteen forms of Trilobites, which have been described as dis- tinct species and ranked under ten different genera, are really the successive forms of one and the same species; the differences which they present both in size and conformation being analogous to those that we see in the existing tribes most nearly allied to them, and the whole series constituting one con- tinuous succession. Instances in which new species have been erected among the higher classes of animals, especially among Birds, for the reception of individuals whose differences were only seasonal, have been so frequently recorded, that it is sufficient here to mention them. It is obvious that such errors can only be corrected by a knowledge of the seasonal changes which the species is liable to undergo. Of this source of difficulty in the discrimination of species, we need take no account in our future inquiries ; for although, in the Orang and Chimpanzee, the alteration in the conformation of the cranium which takes place at the period of second dentition, is so very decided, that it formerly gave rise to much confusion, which has only disap- peared before a fuller knowledge of the history of these animals, yet no change of such magnitude occurs in Man; and of theVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 130.'} + o 1 degree of change which does take place in the several races of mankind, between infancy and old age, there is seldom much difficulty in collecting information. 2. The influence of external conditions in modifying the conformation both of Plants and Animals, is a question of fundamental importance in the determination of the value of specific characters. In this respect there is a very extraordinary diversity among the several races of living beings, even among those which are most nearly allied to each other ; for whilst some possess such a capacity for variation, that they are easily influenced by changes in external conditions, and can, in consequence, readily adapt themselves to these, to others this capacity seems altogether denied. It is from this circumstance that we find particular species, of plants, as well as of animals, restricted to particular conditions in regard to climate, food, &c., their constitu- tions not being able to adapt themselves to any considerable change ; whilst others are more widely dispersed, simply because their constitutions can accommodate themselves to alterations in these conditions. Hence a change of food or climate, to which the latter soon become habituated, is fatal to the former. We see this difference well marked in the Feline tribe ; for whilst the greater part of the larger species, such as the lion and tiger, are inhabitants of tropical regions, and cannot endure the winter's cold, even in the temperate zone, the domestic cat follows man in almost all his wanderings, and can sustain extremes of heat and cold as well as he can himself. This accommodation is effected by a change in the organism itself, of which evident indications are frequently presented, even within the course of a short time: thus, sheep transported from this country to the West Indies soon loose their covering of thick wool, and acquire in the place of it a short, fine hair, shining and smooth, like that of the goat in his best state, so that after a few years the sheep can scarcely be distinguished from the goats, save by their general con- formation ; and in this, too, from the usual absence of any considerable accumulation of fat in the bodies of the sheep, there is not nearly so much difference between the two races, as there is in temperate climates. The continued action of the same cir- cumstances for a few generations, gives in- creased permanence to the new characters of the breed, so that acquired peculiarities of conformation become congenital. Thus, Sir C. Lyell mentions* that some Englishmen engaged in conducting the mining operations of the Real del Monte Company in Mexico, carried out with them some greyhounds of the best breed, to hunt the hares which abound in that country. The great platform, which is the scene of sport, is at an elevation of about 9000 feet above the level of the sea, and the mercury in the barometer stands habitually at the height of about 19 inches. * Principles of Geology, seventh edit. p. 568. It was found that the greyhounds could not support the fatigues of a long chase in this attenuated atmosphere, and before they could come up with their prey, they lay down gasping for breath ; but these same animals have produced whelps, which have grown up, and are not in the least degree incommoded by the want of density in the air, but run down the hares with as much ease as the fleetest of their race in this country. In fact, it can- not be reasonably questioned, if the history of the domesticated races of animals be fairly considered, that changes in external condi- tions are capable of exerting a very decided influence upon the physical form, the habits and instincts, and the various functions of life, in species possessing this adaptiveness. The variations thus induced extend to con- siderable modifications in the external aspect, such as the colour, the texture, and the thickness of the external covering; to the structure of limbs and proportional size of parts ; to the relative development of the organs of the senses and of the psychical powers, involving changes in the form of the cranium, and to acquired propensities, which, within certain limits (depending, it would appear, on their connexion with the natural habits of the species) may become hereditary. Of the changes in psychical characters thus induced by external circumstances, the fol- lowing are trustworthy examples. We are informed by M. Roulin (to whose researches on the changes which the domesticated races, introduced by the Spaniards into South Ame- rica, have subsequently undergone, we shall frequently have occasion to refer), that a race of dogs employed for hunting deer in the platform of Santa Fe, in Mexico, is distin- guished by the peculiar mode in which they attack their game. This consists in seizing the animal by the belly, and overturning it by a sudden etfort, taking advantage of the moment when the body of the deer rests only upon the fore-legs; the weight of the animal thus thrown over, being often six times that of its antagonist. Now, the dog of pure breed inherits a disposition to this kind of chase, and never attacks a deer from before while running; and even should the deer, not perceiving him, come directly upon him, the dog steps aside, and makes his assault upon the flank. On the other hand, European dogs, though of superior strength and general sagacity, are destitute of this instinct; and for want of similar precautions, they are often killed by the deer on the spot, the cervical vertebra; being dislocated by the violence of the shock.* A new instinct has also become hereditary in a mongrel race of dogs, employed by the inhabitants of the banks of the Magda- lena almost exclusively in hunting the white- lipped peccari. The address of these dogs consists in restraining their ardour and attach- ing themselves to no individual in particular, but keeping the whole in check. Now, among these dogs, some are found, which, the very * Annales des Sciences Xaturelles, 1829, torn, xvi. p. 16.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1301 first time they are taken to the woods, are acquainted with this mode of attack ; whereas a dog of another breed starts forward at once, is surrounded by the peccari, and, whatever may be his strength, is destroyed in a moment. The fixed and deliberate stand of the pointer, again, whether taught by the agency of man, or a habit engendered, like the preceding, by the force of circumstances, is so intimately con- nected with the constitution of the race, that occasionally it becomes hereditary ; a young pointer, taken into the field for the first time, being often observed to perform its duty as well as its long-trained seniors. A still more remarkable example of the transmission of acquired psychical peculiarities, is afforded by the case of the retriever, a breed of dogs which has been trained to keep close to the sportsman until he has fired, and then to go in search of the game which he has wounded or brought down. It is obvious that this habit could only have been taught by the agency of man ; and yet it has been frequently observed that a young retriever, on the very first occasion of being taken into the field, has conducted itself as well, and brought back game with as much steadiness, as older dogs which had been schooled into the same ma- noeuvre by means of the whip and collar.* No really philosophical botanist or zoolo- gist, then, should venture to establish specific distinctions between two races, otherwise than provisionally, until he has been able to assure himself that the one may not be con- verted into the other by a change in external conditions. Characters which are of the most trivial kind in themselves, may be valid grounds of specific distinction, if they are nut liable to be thus affected ; on the other hand, characters which would be accepted in one group as sufficient for the separation of ge- nera, may be found totally inadequate in an- other for the discrimination of species, being liable to modification under a very slight change of external conditions. Every one is familiar with the changes which have been in- duced in plants by cultivation, — how a " sin- gle" flower is converted into a "double" one; how the spines, prickles, and thorns covering the surface may be obliterated (a change which was fancifully, but not impro- perly, termed by Linnaeus " the taming of wild fruits ") ; and how the wavy leaves may be- come thick and fleshy (as in the change of the Brassica oleracea into the cabbage), or the slender flower-stalks may be converted into a substantial mass (as in the conversion of the same plant into the cauliflower). These changes do not, as some have alleged, throw the least doubt on the " permanence of spe- cies," or favour the doctrine of " transmuta- tion " in the slightest degree ; for however wide may be limits of variation, each species has its limits; and so far from having per- manently advanced, under the influence of * See Mr. P. A. Knight's Paper on the Heredi- tary and Acquired Instincts of Animals, in the Phi- losophical Transactions for 1837. cultivation, to a superior type of structure, the plants thus modified will all return to their original form, when subjected to their original conditions. Numerous instances might be cited from the British Flora alone, in which the most experienced botanists are in dis- agreement upon the question of specific unity or diversity, simply because they have not yet ascertained the limits to the variations which the same plant may present, when growing under a variety of external conditions ; and the difficulty is yet greater when British and Continental species are compared, the variety of external conditions being greater, and the amount of allowance which should be made for their influence being known in but a few cases. The same may be said of Animals ; particularly of those on which the influence of domestication has been brought to bear. Upon this point, however, we shall defer en- larging, until the next head of the inquiry has been considered. 3. A tendency to variation exists in many races, which manifests itself rather in modi- fications of the specific type presented in the course of successive generations, than in the alterations induced by external agencies in the individuals of one generation. Thus we find that the offspring of any one pair do not all precisely agree among themselves, or with their parents, in bodily conformation or in psychical character ; but that individual differ- ences (as they are termed) exist among them. Now, as this tendency to variation cannot be clearly traced to any influence of external cir- cumstances, it is commonly distinguished by the term ' spontaneous ;' but there is much to favour the belief, that such variations are attributable to agencies operating either on both parents, previous to their intercourse, or at the time of coition, or to influences acting on the female during the period of utero-gestation.* For it may be uniformly observed, that those animals exhibit the greatest tendency to this ' spontaneous ' va- riation, which present the greatest constitu- tional adaptiveness to a variety of external conditions. And there are many cases in which it seems pretty clear, that the cause of this variation must be looked for in that com- bination of influences, which is known under the general term domestication. Thus it may be stated as a general fact, that the varieties of colour so remarkable in domesticated races, tend to disappear when these races return in any considerable degree towards their primi- tive wild state. This has been especially noticed in the horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, and dogs, introduced by the Spaniards into South America ; and the observation has been con- firmed in other parts of the globe, showing that there is nothing peculiar to the climate of that country, which brings about the altera- * As these modifications are witnessed in domes- ticated birds no less than in mammals, it is obvious that the latter source of influence is excluded in their case; and we must fall back upon the pro- bability of a change in the constitution of the pa- rents, previously to the generative act.1305 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. tion. Now this has been attributed to the free intermixture of differently-coloured pa- rents, which tends to confuse the breeds, and to merge those varieties which are artificially kept up among domesticated races by the matching of similar parents. But although this cause doubtless operates, yet it is far from being the whole truth ; for the converse occurrence may take place in animals which are in process of being reclaimed from their wild state, under circumstances that forbid the idea of any such intermixture. Thus, Mr. Bell informs us that an Australian bitch, or dingo, had a litter of puppies, the father of which was also of that breed ; both parents had been taken in the wild state ; both were of the uniform reddish-brown colour which belongs to the race ; and the mother had never bred before; but the young, bred in confine- ment, and in a half-domesticated state, were all more or less spotted.* Now, considering the strong evidence which exists, that the colour of the offspring, in animals in which the hue is disposed to vary, may be affected by a mental impression at the time of im- pregnation f, it does not seem improbable that various differences in the general condition of a wild and of a domesticated animal, should so affect the constitution of the latter, as to occasion an amount of variation in its off- spring which does not exist in the former. — The same general rule holds good in Plants. The tendency to the (so called) spontaneous production of varieties, is the greatest in those species which are most susceptible of influence by cultivation ; andthose which are themselves least changed by external conditions, are those which are observed to transmit their distinc- tive characters most constantly and uninter- ruptedly from one generation to another. Fur- ther, the influence of cultivation will sometimes develop in the individual the very same de- partures from the usual specific type, which are, in other cases, 'spontaneously ' manifested in the offspring of a common parent. Thus, it is well known that, by cultivation, the prim- rose may be converted into the polyanthus, and the cowslip into the oxslip; but the late Dean of Manchester raised all these four forms from the seeds of the same plant; and Professor Henslow has been equally suc- cessful. Until the limits of this tendency to spon- taneous variation have been determined, there* fore, in each particular instance, no valid specific distinctions can be erected. It hap- pens, in certain groups, that a peculiarity, in itself very trivial, is transmitted uninterrupt- edly from one generation to another, with such constancy and regularity as to justify us in believing that it has been always manifested. Thus many of the reputed specific differences of Moths and Butterflies rest on no other foundation, than the constant presence of a certain spot on some part of their wings; and * British Quadrupeds, 2d edit. p. 203. f See a valuable collection of such cases by Dr. Harvey, in the Edinburgh Monthly Journal for November, 1850. there are Felines, which agree so closely in the structure of their skeletons as not to be dis- tinguishable osteologically, and which are only regarded as belonging to distinct species, be- cause a certain stripe or spot, which uniformly shows itself on the skin of one, is as uniformly absent from that of the other. On the other hand, we see, in all our domesticated races, great diversities among the offspring of a common parentage ; and these differences are sometimes so marked, that if he had not positive evidence of this common parentage, the naturalist would undoubtedly be justified, by the importance of the diversity, in the es- tablishment of numerous specific types, when he has really seen but a few of the varieties into which one and the same may pass. Of this tendency to " spontaneous " varia- tion, it may be remarked, further, that like the variation which may be traced to external conditions, it has its limits, and does not really tend to confuse the boundaries of species, although it may frequently show the necessity for their extension. Thus, notwith- standing the multitude of varieties of the Apple and the Pear which we possess, and notwithstanding the apparent triviality of the specific distinction between them (this being little else than the existence of a gritty centre in the pear, which is absent in the apple), yet we never find this distinction confounded by the presence of the distinctive characters of the pear in the descendant of an apple, or by the absence of it in the descendant of a pear. So we find that, notwithstanding the multi- plication of breeds of dogs and horses, sheep and oxen, pigs and poultry, they all retain the characters by which their respective kinds are distinguished from their congeners. There is no tendency to an obliteration of the dis- tinctions between a dog and a fox, or between a horse and an ass; but these distinctions are perpetuated with the same regularity, that marks the stripes of the leopard or the spots on the wing of a moth. But, on the other hand, by observation of the spontaneous changes which particular tribes of plants or animals are liable to exhibit, we are some- times led to extend our ideas of the compre- hensiveness of species, and to bring into the same category forms which were previously supposed to be distinct types. Thus, for example, it is the opinion of many distin- guished naturalists, that not only are all the breeds of Dogs to be considered as consti- tuting one species, but that this species must also include the Wolf; or, in other words, that the wolf and the dog are to be con- sidered as collateral descendants from the same original parents. We shall presently examine more in detail the evidence on which this belief is founded ; supposing it to be correct, we are only required to enlarge our idea of the comprehensiveness of the species Cams lupus, which must then include all the breeds of C. familiaris as its varieties: and none of them are in any more danger than before, of being confounded with the fox or the jackal. Until, however, the limits ofVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1306 variation have been clearly determined in the case of any species which is known to exhibit the tendency, it is obviously impossible to erect specific distinctions that shall possess anything but a provisional value ; and thus the naturalist may feel a confident assurance of the genuineness of one set of species in a natural group, whilst he is utterly at a loss respecting another. Reverting, then, to the " idea" of a species, as involving descent from a common, or at any rate from a similar parentage, in all the in- dividuals composing it, we have to aim at ascertaining, in the case of two or more beings whose specific identity or distinctness is a question for our determination, whether their characters are presented so fixedly and deter- minately in all the individuals of the same and of successive generations, as to justify us in believing that they have been thus preserved through all time, and under all changes of external conditions. According to the amount and correctness of our information upon this question, will be the validity of our specific distinctions; on the other hand, according to the hastiness and crudity of our decision, will be its liability to be overthrown by subsequent researches. Of course, where the progeny of any known stock can be traced through a long period of time, and under great varieties of external conditions, and their successive variations have been noted, this evidence must outweigh every argument founded upon the supposed importance of the characters which are found to undergo modification. But such opportunities are too frequently wanting ; and the naturalist is obliged to have recourse to means of discrimination which are less certain, but which will frequently conduct him, pro- vided that his researches have been sufficiently extensive, to a satisfactory conclusion. The great point at which he should aim, is the assemblage of as many forms as possible of each type ; and having done so, he will care- fully compare them with each other, for the sake of determining whether the supposed specific characters are constant and well- marked throughout, or whether they tend to run together by intermediate gradations. If the first of these should prove to be the case, great confidence may be entertained of their genuineness; but if the second, we may feel an almost certain assurance of their invalidity. Thus, to revert to the case of the apple and the pear, the persistence of their distinctive characters through all the numerous varieties of each, renders it almost certain, that in all other varieties which may hereafter present themselves, the same constancy will obtain; and that it has obtained during the entire suc- cession of generations of pears and apples, from the time of their first propagation. But let us take an opposite case. Two Terebratnlce are brought together from different parts of the great Southern Ocean, the one of which has the edges of the valves of the shell thrown into deep plications, whilst in the other they are quite smooth. Now in most other Bivalve Mollusca, such a difference would be justly admitted to afford a valid specific character , and the conchologist who had only these two shells before him, would be justified, by the usual rules of the science, in ranking each as a distinct specific type. But as his col- lection extends, intermediate forms come into his possession; and at last he finds that he can make a continuous series, passing, by the most gradual transition, from the smoothest to the most deeply plicated form. Thus, then, the supposed validity of this distinction is altogether destroyed ; and it becomes evident that the most plicated and the smoothest of these Terebratulce must be regarded as be- longing to one and the same species, notwith- standing the marked diversity of their extreme forms. Hence, whilst new types are continually being discovered, the progress of research is tending to diminish the number of species previously enumerated ; for there are many groups in which an immense reduction has been effected, by bringing together all those which are found to be nothing else than suc- cessive stages of the same individual, and by ranking under one designation all those which are either known or strongly suspected to be mere varieties, resulting from the direct influ- ence of external conditions upon themselves or upon their ancestors, or produced through the obscurer operation of these influences on the act of generation. Frequently it is found that forms which have even been accounted generically distinct, are in reality specifically identical. Thus it has been shown by Pro- fessor Henslow, that the " rust of corn" (Uredo rubigo) is but an earlier form of the " mildew " {Puccinia graminis) ; the one form being capable of development into the other; and the fructification characteristic of the two supposed genera having been produced from the same individual. And it is asserted by Fries, that out of a single species of Thelephora, more than eight genera of Fungi have been con- structed by various authors. So among higher plants, the invalidity of the generic distinctions on which reliance is usually placed, has been shown, so far as the Orchideous tribe is con- cerned, by the fact that the same individual has borne the flowers and pseudo-bulbs usually accounted characteristic of three distinct genera, and that another individual has pre- sented the character of a fourth. * So in the animal kingdom, it has been shown by Pro- fessor Milne Edwards, that the polypidom of Tubulipora verrucosa, according to the circum- stances under which it grows, may present the characters of three other reputed genera. If it be attached to a plane surface, as the expanded lamina of a sea-weed, it remains circular, and * For the first of these cases, see the Linn asan Transactions, vol. xvii. The second fell under the writer's own observation in the Durham Down Nursery, near Bristol; here, also, three different forms, generally considered as generically distinct were presented ; and two of them were the same as in the preceding case : but the third was one not exhibited by that plant.1307 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. increases with great regularity, constituting the Madrepora verrucosa of Fabricius. If it cluster round the cylindrical and branching stem of a Fucus, it increases irregularly, and assumes the form of the Millcpora tubulosa of Ellis. If its development in any direction be checked by a mechanical obstacle, the form of the mass will again be changed, and its tubes will be recurved backwards; a character on which Lamouroux founded his genus Obclia. Sometimes on the very same polypidom, we find one portion whose disposition corre- sponds with that of Millepora tubulosa, and another which, if detached, would be con- sidered a specimen of Obclia lubulifcra* Many similar cases might be quoted ; all of them showing, not that there is any real con- fusion amongst species and genera, but that naturalists have too often assumed variable and non-essential characters as the basis of their systematic distinctions, in ignorance of those which are fixed and determinate. Thus, in the case in question, it is on the structure of the animal, not on the form of the poly- pidom, that the modern Zoophytologist places his chief reliance ; and a knowledge of this would have prevented the assignment of the varieties of coral, formed by one anil the same kind of animal, to three different genera. So among Mollusca, it has been shown by Mr. Gray-)- that a large number of species have been formed, in consequence of the variations pre- sented by the shells of the same species at different periods of life, or developed under different circumstances. The change from salt or fresh water to brackish, or from brackish to salt or fresh, which many species are able to sustain, appears to have a con- siderable influence on the form of their shells ; thus Professor E. Forbes has shown that certain Palvdinm and Naticce, which are found in successive tertiary strata in the island of Cos, associated in some cases with decidedly fresh-water, and in others with decidedly marine, testacea, are probably to be regarded as varieties of the same species, notwith- standing that they would be regarded by conchologists as distinct; gradations being traceable between one form and another, and the changes being of a kind which are known to take place among fresh-water mol- lusca. % As an example of the mode in which the philosophic zoologist proceeds in his exami- nation of a doubtful case of unity or diversity of species, in a group more closely related to man, we shall consider the question of the relations of the several races of Dogs to each other. Every one is familiar with the fact that numerous breeds of dogs exist in almost every part of the world inhabited by civilised man, distinguished from each other by well-marked peculiarities, which appear to be transmitted continuously from parent * Memoire sur les Tubulipores, in Ann. iles Sci.

These dif- ferences extend to stature, form, proportions, swiftness of foot, colour and texture of hair, acuteness of sensations, intelligence, and at- tachment to man ; and they are particularly well marked in the conformation of the cra- nium, the part to which the anatomist first looks for his distinctive characters, b The changes in the conformation of the cranial portion of the skull, which distinguish the domesticated races of the dog from those which have been less modified by the j in- fluence of man, partly consist in the obli- teration of the sagittal crest, which rises up on the line of junction of the parietal bones, and of its continuation on the occipital bone. In the large deer-hound, we are assured by Prof. Owen, these cristas are as strongly developed as in the wolf; whilst in the smaller spaniel or pug, they are entirely wanting, the cranial dome being smooth ami round. But " such modifications," as Prof. Owen remarks, " are unaccompanied by any change in the connections, that is in the dis- position of the sutures, of the cranial bones ; they are chiefly due to arrests of develop- ment, — to retention of more or less of the character of immaturity; even the large pro- portional size of the brain in the smaller va- rieties of house-dog, is in a great degree due to the rapid acquisition by the cerebral organ of its specific size, agreeably with the general law of its development, but which is attended in the varieties cited by an arrest of the gene- ral growth of its body, as well as of the par- ticular developments of the skull in relation to the muscles of the jaws." Such an altera- tion is considered by this eminent anatomist as fairly referable to the influence of domes- tication ; since, as he remarks, " no other domestic animal manifests so great a range of variety in regard to general size, to the colour and character of the hair, and to the form of the head, as it is affected by different propor- tions of cranium and face, and by the inter- muscular crests superadded to the cranial parietes." " Yet under the extremest mask of variety so superinduced," he continues, " the naturalist detects in the dental formula, and in the construction of the cranium, the un- mistakable generic and specific characters of the Canis familiaris." * Generally speaking, the cranial cavity of the domesticated dogs is relatively increased in capacity; the facial por- tion, on the other hand, is oftener shortened. The skull of the Australian dingo differs but little from that of a wolf. In both, the arch formed by the temporal and parietal bones is much depressed, so that the cranial cavity is small, and the head flat. The Danish doc and the mastiff resemble the dingo in the shape of their heads, and display as little of intellect or sagacity. The terrier and the hound have the parietal bones more arched, and, consequently, possess a larger cranial cavity. The greyhound has a longer muzzle, and smaller frontal sinuses than the hound ; * Zoological Transactions, vol.iii. p. 41 j.1308 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. and the nasal cavity, though elongated, is much contracted, especially at its upper part, so that the sense of smell is less acute in this breed than in most others. The shep- herd's dog, which Buffon very erroneously considered as the breed least modified by domestication, is distinguished by its remark- ably capacious cranium ; the temporal bones not beginning to arch over the cavity, until they have risen perpendicularly to half their height. In the spaniel and Newfoundland dog, the capacity of the cranium is yet greater than in the preceding ; and they are also dis- tinguished by the remarkable size of their frontal sinuses, which causes the forehead to rise almost perpendicularly from the nasal bones. The bull-dog, on the other hand, is distinguished by the shortness and extraordi- nary breadth of its muzzle ; while its cranium is less capacious than that of the shepherd's dog. The varieties in general conformation are not less remarkable than those in cranial configuration. Thus, the relative length of the tail is subject to great variation, even the number of its vertebrae differing so widely as from 16 to 21. Some races have an addi- tional claw on the hind foot; and many have an additional false molar on one or both sides. The nature of the hairy covering, too, varies in regard to its closeness or scantiness, its length, its colour, the fineness or coarseness of its texture, &c. &c. ; so that, as M. Fred. Cuvier remarks, the dog-kind presents all the varieties, in respect to the nature of the hairy covering of the body, that are to be found in the entire class of Mammalia. The form of the ears, too, is another marked feature of distinction ; these organs being short and erect in some, long and pendulous in others. The differences in habit and psychical cha- racter, also, are almost as characteristic as those of form. The greater number of dogs track their prey by scent ; and this quality may be developed by care in breeding*, so that it attains its greatest excellence in the highest-bred fox-hounds, blood-hounds, and pointers. But the greyhound hunts almost solely by sight ; and, in breeding it, every care is taken to obtain swiftness and " wind," and power of enduring sudden and violent bursts of exertion. In the degree and nature of their attachment to man, again, which is the most marked psychical feature common to them all, we observe a very striking diversity. Perhaps the bull-dog is, of all the domestic- ated races, that which is least prone to seek the society of man ; yet, notwithstanding its obsti- nacy and ferocity, it does form attachments to human beings, and especially to those'whose savage nature is most akin to its own. On the other hand, the pug, which seems like a dwarf- variety of the bull-dog, is remarkably timid ; and, though possessing but litde sagacity, is tolerably good tempered. The mastiff, again, * The principal mode in which the influence of man is exerted in modifying the characters of the races under his control, consists in the selection of those individuals only for propagation, which display the desired attributes in the greatest perfection. possesses the determined courage of the bull- dog, but is greatly influenced by kindness, and shows a generous and intelligent nature. The setter, with a considerable degree of sagacity and intelligence, is remarkable for its affectionate and grateful nature, for its docility, and for its humble and anxious solicitude to please. Of all the races of dogs, the spaniel is the one most distinguished for attachment to man; the most timid, fond, and affec- tionate ; the most patient under ill treatment: it is, however, by no means distinguished for courage ; and though very docile, is not re- markable for native sagacity. It is perhaps in the shepherd's dog that the attribute of intelligence is most strikingly displayed, in combination with courage, fidelity, and per- severance : he lives in habits of constant familiarity with his master, learns to interpret his looks and words with an intuitive com- prehension, and allows no difficulty or danger to prevent him from carrying his directions into effect. The Newfoundland dog, perhaps, combines more than any other breed the qualities which render the race most generally serv iceable to man ; although this combination is not such as fits him for any of those special uses, to which other breeds are particularly adapted. Now these differences are far greater than those which exist among the acknowledged species of the feline race * ; and therefore, at first sight, might be considered as amply jus- tifying the erection of specific distinctions among the several breeds of the canine. But the endeavour to do so would be attended with insuperable difficulties ; for, in the first place, it has been shown by M. Fred. Cuvierf, who has paid particular attention to this question, that if we assume the varieties to be permanent races, or originally distinct species, and predetermine that these races are susceptible of few or no modifications, it will be requisite to institute at least fifty different species of dogs, all distinguished from each other by recognisable characters, — a hypo- thesis which cannot for a moment be enter- tained. Moreover, every one who has much intercourse with the canine races becomes im- pressed with the feeling, that, notwithstanding the diversities of the greyhound and the bull- dog, the blood-hound and the spaniel, the Newfoundland and the terrier, they are all dogs; and there is obviously an instinctive recognition of this fact among the animals themselves, as is seen by the readiness in which the individuals of the most dissimilar breeds will fraternise together. Further, as already remarked, there is a marked ab- sence of tendency to variation in the cha- racters of the feline races, the limits of each • The writer has been assured by Mr. S. Stutch- bury, who was formerly sub-curator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, that even Cuvier proved himself unable to distinguish the cranium of a lion from that of a tiger. f Recherches sur les Caracteres Osteologiques, qui distinguent les principales Races du Chien do- mestique. Armales du Museum, torn, xviii.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1300 species being defined by the preservation of its characters through successive genera- tions and under all circumstances ; the only exception to this general statement, being in the case of the domestic cat, which, like the dog, passes into numerous varieties, none of which, however, show an approximation to the characters of any other species. Hence, notwithstanding the extent of variation pre- sented among dogs, the characters of the breeds do not bear a specific value; for an amount of variation may be seen among the successive generations of the same breed, how- ever pure it may be kept, or even among the offspring of the same litter, quite sufficient to show that a strong capacity for modification exists in this species. It would not be diffi- cult, moreover, to bring together a series of individuals, that should connect the most ex- treme forms by imperceptible gradations ; all the different races breed together with the most complete freedom ; and, as already re- marked, there is a continual tendency amongst them, if they escape from the influence of man, and intermingle unrestrainedly in a state approaching to their original wildness, to a return to one uniform type of configuration and of hue. Further, whatever their other differences in psychical character, we find that they all agree in that tendency to association with man, which is pretty obviously the chief source of those diversities ; the most impor- tant departures from the natural habits of a wild race, being those which have been im- pressed upon the several breeds by a long course of training, whose influence has been transmitted, to a certain extent, from one generation to another. We have seen that, in particular races of dogs existing in a half wild state, the force of circumstances, without any human intervention, has developed a new instinct, which has become hereditary within a few generations; and there can be no diffi- culty in understanding, therefore, that the psychical as well as the physical characters of the dog may have undergone a far more marked alteration, in the prolonged period during which he has been under the influence of man. However considerable, then, are the anatomical and psychological differences of the most diverse breeds, these are perpetuated only by the agency of man, and tend to merge themselves in a common type as soon as this is withdrawn ; and through all these changes, the pl/i/siological conformity, as marked especially by the generative function, is constantly preserved. And thus it may be unhesitatingly asserted, that there is no such clear and well-marked' natural distinction be- tween the several breeds of dogs, as can serve to justify the assignment of a separate parent- age to any of them. The question next arises, whether the dog is a domesticated form of any other species of the genus Canis, e. g. the wolf* the fox, or the jackal; or whether it is descended from an original wild stock, which has sub- sequently become extinct. Now the fox may be at once excluded, as differing in the vertical elongation of the pupil, the peculiar bushiness of the tail, and in other charac- ters. The affinity of the dog to the jackal is certainly not so close as that which it bears to the wolf; and there are many dis- tinguished naturalists who regard the latter as its original. In support of this view, the following considerations may be urged. No specific character has yet been framed so as to be equally applicable to all the breeds of dogs, which does not include the wolf also ; and it does not seem likely that any valid specific distinction can be established upon anatomical grounds only. The various races of wild dogs, in proportion to their entire emancipa- tion from the influence of man, exhibit more and more of the lank and gaunt form, the lengthened limbs, the long and slender muzzle, anil the great comparative strength, which cha- racterise the wolf; and in the dingo of Aus- tralia, which presents these peculiarities in the most marked degree, and which may be con- sidered as the most remote from a state of do- mestication, the tail assumes the slightly bushy form of that of the wolf. In no point of its osteology does the wolf differ more from dogs in general, than they differ from each other; and the interval, in fact, is much less between the wolf and the races of dogs just alluded to, than it is between these and the races which most strongly exhibit the influ- ence of domestication. Further, the wolf and the dog readily breed together, and their progeny is fertile with either of the parent races ; but whether the hybrids thus produced are fertile with each other, and a new race can be thus established, has not yet been ascertained. The term of utero-gestation is the same for the wolf as for the dog, viz. sixty-three days; that of the jackal, on the other hand, is but fifty-nine. It is a remark- able fact, that the habit of barking is pe- culiar to dogs which have been accustomed to intimate association with Man ; and, like variety of colour, it is soon induced in the progeny of those to whom it is not natural, when these are reared in a state of domes- tication. Thus, the puppies of the Esqui- maux dogs brought home by our Arctic ex- plorers, being accustomed to the sound of the human voice from the earliest period, learn to bark, whilst their parents remain confined to their original sounds. The principal objection to the idea of the specific identity of the two races, lies in their difference of psychical character; the wolf being apparently altogether destitute of that disposition to attach itself to man, and of that capacity of modification under his in- fluence, which is so marked a feature in the nature of the dog. It has been asserted that the wolf is so untameably savage, that it would require ages of domestication to render it even moderately tractable, if, indeed it could ever be brought under subjection. Such an assertion, however, does not seem borne out by facts. Mr. T. Bell* relates an * British Quadrupeds, p. 199.1310 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. instance of friendly recognition towards him- self and other persons, shown by a bitch wolf at the Zoological Gardens ; and cites from Mr. Fred. Cuvier a very remarkable instance of affectionate and submissive attachment shown by a young wolf towards the individual by whom he had been brought up, in a degree that scarcely seems inferior to that manifested by the dog. " Now, if we find," he remarks, " that the mere education of a young wolf, taken from its parents in a wild state, could so far change its natural disposition, and render it so fond, so intelligent, and so grate- ful as this, what may we not expect from the successive transmission of improvement by the culture and training of a whole race for ages?" On the other hand, in those races of dogs which have become emancipated from human control, the psychical nature of the wolf developes itself, in precise proportion to the approach presented to its physical charac- ters. And even in the most domesticated breeds, instances of spontaneous reversion to wild habits are occasionally to be met with. " Thus," says Mr. Blyth, " I have known this to occur in a male pointer and a female grey- hound ; the latter was so fine a specimen of the breed, that on being entrapped, it was thought desirable to obtain a litter from her, which was accordingly effected; but while her puppies were very young, she managed to escape to the woods, and never returned ; three of her progeny grew to be excellent hounds, but two others proved quite irreclaim- able, and escaping from servitude, like their dam, were finally shot, for their destructive poaching propensities."* Thus it appears that, even if we hesitate in pronouncing in favour of the specific identity of the dog and the wolf, there is, at any rate, no valid ground for the establishment of a specific distinction between them ; and if it should prove that the hybrid offspring are fer- tile amongst themselves, and that a vigorous mixed race is the result, the probability of their specific identity would be greatly in- creased. The required proof, however, could only be afforded by the actual production from the wolf stock, of a race having the aptitude for domestication, and capacity for variation, exhibited by the dog. There is another mode of looking at the question, however, which has been recently suggested by Professor Agassiz.j' This distin- guished naturalist thinks it impossible to ac- count for the geographical distribution and va- rieties of conformation of many existing species of animals, without having recourse to the idea that, instead of all the individuals of that spe- cies having descended from a single parentage, or pair of ' protoplasts,' they are the offspring of several distinct pairs of' protoplasts,' first introduced in different localities, all possessing the same essential nature, but having that nature modified in accordance with the spe- * Translation of Cuyier's Regne Animal, p. 90. t See his recent woA on the Fishes of Lake Su- perior ; also the Ediftb. New Philos. Jouni., April, 1850. cial conditions in which each was destined to exist. From the definition of species, there- fore, he would exclude the idea of identity of descent, and would substitute that of similarity ; but would still base his distinction of species, as do other naturalists, on the constant trans- mission of some well-marked peculiarity com- mon to all the races, and would thus as- sociate all those which obvious!}' partake of a common nature, and are disposed to free intermixture, notwithstanding the non-iden- tity of their parentage.* He would probably accord with other naturalists, therefore, in regarding the different breeds of dogs as va- rieties of one species ; but would attribute the origin of their several peculiarities in part to the differences in their first parents, which were not, however, sufficient to constitute specific distinctions. Although there may be cases in which such an hypothesis presents the readiest solution of the difficulty, yet it can scarcely be accepted as applicable to that of the dog; for we do not here find that the races which most nearly approximate to the wild state in different parts of the world, do present any differences that enable us to re- gard them as the respective ancestors of our most diverse domesticated breeds. If, for example, it could be shown that the Esqui- maux dog peculiarly resembled the mastiff", that the Indian dhole might be regarded as the progenitor of the greyhound, that the * Of the hypothesis of the radiation of species from several distinct centres, Prof. E. Forbes may be regarded as the most conspicuous opponent. He has laboured to show that the peculiarities in the geographical distribution of existing species are quite reconcilable with the idea of migration from single centres, and that, generally speaking, they necessarily lead to that idea; whilst, on the other hand, in those instances in which detached or out- lying spots occur, remote from the principal area of distribution, and from each other, he considers that these represent the original extent of range, which has been subsequently interrupted by geological changes that have been fatal to the existence of the species over the intermediate connecting areas,— as, by the substitution of water for land, or of land for water; by the elevation or depression of the sea- bottom, in a degree incompatible with the continued existence of the species if it be marine ; by similar changes in the land, exerting a like influence on ter- restrial species; by alterations thus induced in the course and connection of rivers and watercourses, which have broken up the areas of fluviatile and la- custrine species; by changes of temperature conse- quent upon remoter causes; and many other in- fluences too numerous here to recount. He affirms that, in so many cases, these peculiarities may be thus explained by knoivn geological changes, which have occurred since the introduction of the species in question (this being the case peculiarly with those that existed in the glacial epoch, and then had an extensive southern range, which is now only in- dicated by their occurrence in outlying spots, the principal area of the species being now restricted to the circum-polar regions, in consequence of the more elevated temperature of the parts beyond), that we have fair ground for extending this view to all, and for in ferring the occurrence of geological changes, subsequently to the first diffusion of particular species, from the peculiarities of its existing distri- bution. As yet, however, his views on this subject have not been given to the world in any complete form, save by oral discourses.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1311 Australian dingo was the probable ancestor of the spaniel, and that the American wild-dog gives us the type of the pug, the hypothesis of Professor Agassiz might be admitted to possess a considerable claim to our reception. But so far is this from being the case, that, as already pointed out, the several races of wild clogs present a remarkable conformity to a common type; and neither of them can be looked to, in preference to the others, as the probable source of those domesticated breeds which are most diverse from each other, and from the supposed common type. Moreover, there is a strong probability, considering the very remarkable character of the zoology of New Holland, that the dingo was not indige- nous to that country, but that it was intro- duced there by its human colonizers ; thus, being a descendant of the Indian dhole, or of the same stock with it. Hence, even if we admit the multiplication of' protoplasts' in the case of the dog, we are still driven back upon the influences of domestication as the direct or indirect source of those variations from the fundamental type, by which the existing races are severally characterised. The historical evidence of modification in successive generations, which is inadequate to prove the specific identity of the several races of Dogs, is much more fully supplied in the case of some other domesticated animals; and suffices to show that although the tendency to spontaneous variation may seem to have nearly exhausted itself heretofore in the production of the most divergent forms, still there remains enough to originate new races, distinguished by well-marked pecu- liarities of conformation, even under our own eyes. Some of our most valuable information on this subject, is derived from the changes which have taken place in the races of do- mesticated animals introduced into the West Indies and South America, by the Spaniards, three centuries and a half since. Many of these races have multiplied extremely in a soil and in a climate congenial to their na- ture; and several of them have run wild in the vast forests of America, and have lost all the most obvious appearances of domestica- tion, whilst they have acquired various pecu- liarities which distinguish them from their domesticated progenitors, some of these, per- haps, being indications of a partial restoration to the primitive characteristics of their re- spective races. The greatest part of our knowledge on this subject is derived from the researches of M. Roulin (already referred to) which relate to New Grenada and Venezuela, anil from the well-known and justly esteemed work of D'Azara on the natural history of Paraguay. No zoologist has any doubt whatever, that the wild boar is the original of our domesti- cated swine; the change from the one form and condition to the other being capable of accomplishment in the course of a few gene- rations. Yet, as Blumenbach has remarked, the difference between the two forms of crania is as great as that between the Negro and the European skulls. And the same eminent physiologist has pointed out, that the varie- ties of swine in various countries, all clearly referable to one stock, exceed in their extent of divergence from it, the very widest de- partures of the human conformation from any one type. Thus, swine with solid hoofs were known to the ancients ; and large breeds of them arc found in Hungary and Sweden, as also in some parts of England. In some other breeds there are five distinct toes, each having its own hoof. The European swine, first carried by the Spaniards to the island of Cubagua, in 1509, have been the progenitors of a race now found there, possessing toes of half a span in length. The hogs which were first introduced into South America by the Spaniards at about the same period, rapidly extended themselves over the northern and central parts of that continent ; and whilst wandering at large in the vast forests of the New World, and feeding on their original diet of fruits and seeds, they have reverted very nearly to the type of the European boar. Their colour, too, has lost the variety ob- servable in the domestic breeds, the wild hogs of the American forests being for the most part uniformly black. The hogs which cover the mountains of the Paramos, where they are subject to severe cold and deficient nourishment, are small and of a stunted figure ; but their skins are covered with thick fur, often somewhat crisp, beneath which is found in some individuals a species of wool. In some of the warmest regions, the swine are not uniformly black, but red like the young peccari ; and elsewhere there are some, whose blackness gives place under the belly to a white band, which reaches up to the back. The question of the original source of the various breeds of ox, will not be now dis- cussed ; it is sufficient for our present pur- pose to notice some of the most remarkable departures from the European type, which have shown themselves in the South Ameri- can descendants of the individuals first intro- duced there by the Spaniards. In the year 1770, as we learn from D'Azara, a hornless bull was produced in Paraguay, which has been the progenitor of a race of hornless cattle that has since multiplied extensively in that country. So, again, as we are informed by M. Roulin, in some of the hot provinces of South America, a variety of ox has been produced, which is noted for its extremely rare and fine fur. This variety tends to per- petuate itself ; but it is not encouraged, be- cause the " pelones" (as they are termed) are too delicate in constitution to bear the cold of the Cordilleras, to which the cattle are driven for the provision of the towns situated upon them. These pelones obviously con- stitute a variety adapted for a particular climate; oxen of other breeds frequently perishing when driven into the provinces in- habited by them, or being with difficulty acclimatised.* But the same hot provinces * Hence we see that so much of Prof. Agassiz' argument for the multiplicity of specific centres, asVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1312 occasionally produce another curious variety, characterised by the entire absence of hair; these naked-skinned oxen, which are called " calongos," are, like the pelones, unable to bear a cold climate, and are very delicate and weak. Another remarkable fact, relative to the oxen of South America, is recorded by M. Roulin. In Columbia, the practice of milking cows was laid aside, owing to the great extent of the farms and other circum- stances. In a few generations, the natural structure of the parts and the natural state of the function have been restored ; the se- cretion of milk taking place only so long as the calf remains with the mother, and ceasing if it dies or is removed. Hence we have a valuable confirmation of the belief previously entertained, that the continued production of milk by the European breeds of cows is a modified function in the animal economy, originating in an artificial habit kept up through many generations, and depend- ent upon a modification of structure which that habit has been the means of inducing. That the various breeds of sheep at present domesticated in Europe, have had a common origin, is not doubted by any zoologist, not- withstanding the differences in their stature and proportions, the texture and colour of their wool, the presence or absence of horns, &c. The most marked deviation from the usual type is presented by a breed of Spanish sheep, distinguished by the length and straightness of the hair, and by the length and spiral twist of the horns. Various breeds are found in Asia and Africa, as to whose specific unity with each other, and with Eu- ropean sheep, zoologists are not agreed. We have a remarkable example of climatic varia- tion, however, in the fact, that in the races spread through Persia, Tartary, and China, the tail seems replaced by a double spherical mass of fat, which forms a most awkward excrescence on the rump, and is nearly desti- tute of hair; whilst these sheep, transferred to the cold, dry pastures of Siberia, are affirmed by Ermann to lose this peculiar conformation in the course of a few generations. The sheep of Syria and Barbary, on the other hand, have an accumulation of fat in the tail itself, which is long, and sometimes attains a weight of from seventy to one hundred pounds. It is a curious and very significant fact, that the sheep of the Cape of Good Hope, which are descended from the European stocks, should exhibit the same tendency to the accumulation of fat about the rump, as is seen in the human races indigenous to that region. The sheep which were transported into South America by the Spaniards, have not multiplied so extensively as the oxen and swine ; and from their more limited diffusion, we find, as might be expected, that they ex- hibit but a comparatively slight amount of variation. The remarkable change in the depends upon the adaptation between the constitu- tion of the several races and the climates in which we find them, is deficient in solidity of foundation. character of the hair, presented by the sheep in the West Indies has been already referred to. — Among sheep, as among other do- mesticated animals, new races are continually being produced by breeders, not merely by crossing or intermixing races already con- stituted and well known, but also by taking advantage of peculiarities which occasion- ally present themselves spontaneously, and using means to perpetuate these. The fol- lowing is one of the most curious examples of this kind upon record. In the year 1791, a ewe on the farm of Seth Wright, in the state of Massachusetts, gave birth to a male lamb, which, without any known cause, had a longer body and shorter legs than the rest of the breed ; the joints also were peculiarly formed, and the fore-legs crooked. The con- formation of this animal rendering it unable to leap over fences, it was thought desirable to endeavour to propagate its peculiarities ; and accordingly when it was fit for procreation, several ewes were impregnated by it. Out of the lambs first produced, only two presented the same peculiarities ; more were obtained hi subsequent years ; and when they became capable of breeding with each other, the new race was completely established j its distinc- tive characters being uniformly presented when both parents possessed them, but tending to disappear when the sheep of the " ancon" or " otter" breed (as it is called) were allowed to breed with those of the ordinary type.* This fact, as we shall hereafter see, has an important bearing on the question of the spontaneous origination of permanent varieties, in the human or any other species that is disposed to undergo occasional modifications ; which modifications, under ordinary circum- stances, disappear as often as they recur. Thus it is not uncommon to meet with fami- lies distinguished by the possession of some peculiarity of feature, or by some well marked departure from the ordinary conformation, such as the possession of six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. If such were to intermarry exclusively with one another, there can be no reasonable doubt that the children would invariably exhibit the same peculiarity ; and that the six-fingered race, which now tends, whenever it is originated, to merge in the prevailing five-fingered type, would then become permanent. When it is considered that the influence of a scanty population, in the early ages of the world, by isolating different families from each other, and causing inter-marriages amongst even very near relatives, would have been precisely the same with that which is now exercised by the breeders of animals, we see one reason why the varieties which then arose should have had a much greater tendency to per- petuation, than those which now occasionally present themselves. In regard to the horse, it will be sufficient to observe that no zoologist has ever ex- * See Col. Hutchinson's Memoir in the Philo- sophical Transactions for 1813.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1313 pressed any doubt of the specific unity of all the domesticated breeds, or of their identity of origin with the so called " wild horses " of Northern Asia: which are probably descended from domesticated progenitors. Yet their diversities in stature, conformation, &c. are very considerable. Thus the ordinary height of the Shetland pony is from eight to ten hands ; and individuals have been occasionally seen which were no more than seven. On the other hand, the draught horse commonly stands from sixteen to seventeen hands ; aifd not unfrequently surpasses this height. In regard to the conformation of the skull, again, it has been remarked by Blumenbach, that there is more difference between the elon- gated head of the Neapolitan horse and the skull of the Hungarian breed, which last is re- markable for its shortness and the breadth of the lower jaw, than there is between the most dissimilar human crania. The differences in general constitution, also, as regards the power of sustained effort on the one hand, or of intense exertion for a short period on the other, are no less remarkable. But the breeds which are furthest removed from each other in these particulars are connected by such a gradual series of transitional forms, that there is no possibility of drawing a line between them ; and, like the various races of dogs, sheep, &c, they freely inter- mingle with each other, and produce offspring which are as fertile with their own kind, as with either of the parent stocks. It has been, in fact, by such intermixture of the large and powerful races of Northern Asia with the lighter and more agile horses of Arabia and Barbary, that many of the Euro- pean breeds have been obtained. The wild horses which at present range over the plains of Tartary differ from the domesticated races in several particulars ; thus, as we are in- formed by Pallas, the cranium is relatively larger and more vaulted, the limbs are stronger, the back is less arched ; their hoofs are smaller and more pointed; their ears are longer and bent more forward. Their habits, moreover, are peculiar; for they asso- ciate together in herds or troops to the number of several thousands, spreading abroad to feed, but congregating together on the appearance of danger, and seemingly putting themselves under the direction of a leader; on the approach of an enemy they close into a dense crowd, and, attacking the intruder, trample him to death; or, like many other gregarious animals, the females, the young, and the weak being placed in the rear, the stronger individuals array themselves in front, and fight most vigorously with their heels. Now these peculiarities of structure and habit are not only seen in the wild horses of Northern Asia, but also in those which have spread themselves over the extensive plains of South America, since their introduction into that continent by the Spaniards ; and it is nearly certain that the former, like the latter, are the descendants of a domesticated stock, whose return to something like the VOL. IV. original condition of the species, has repro- duced (at least in some degree) the original instincts, which had been entirely subdued for a time by the influence of domestication. In the horse, as in the dog, we have evidence that the habits which are developed by human training may become, to a certain extent, hereditary. Thus, it is observed that the wild horse has no pace but the walk and the gallop; the trot, to which European horses are usually trained, is an acquired habit, yet it obviously " comes naturally " to the colt of a domesticated breed ; and, in like manner, the peculiar pace to which the South Ame- rican horses are trained (which is a kind of running amble, the two legs of the same side being moved forwards together) is used with- out any instruction by the offspring of those by whom it has been acquired. Another ex- ample of the transmission of acquired pro- pensities in horses is mentioned by Mr. Knight: the Norwegian ponies have been taught to obey the voice of their riders rather than the bridle ; and the English horse-breakers com- plain that it is impossible to produce the latter habit in the offspring of this race placed under their tuition, notwithstanding that they are exceedingly docile and obedient when they understand the commands of their master, as imparted by word of mouth. It is equally difficult, he adds, to keep them within hedges, owing, perhaps, to the unrestrained liberty to which the race may have been accustomed in Norway. From the present condition and past his- tory of the domesticated races of Mammalia, of which a general survey has thus been taken, some important inferences may be drawn, which it may be advisable to put in the shape of formal propositions ; since in this manner we shall be able to define our terms more strictly, and to use these definitions as the foundation for our future investigations into the relationship of the several branches of the Human family. 1. Races of living beings are, properly, successions of individuals propagated from any given stock ; and the term implies no more than the fact of the transmission of a distinctive character by descent. 2. Two races, distinguished by well-marked peculiarities, may rank either as distinct spe- cies, or as varieties of the same species ; being supposed, in the first case, to be descended from parents which themselves originally ex- hibited the same peculiarities ; and being considered, in the second, as the descendants of an identical, or, at any rate, of a similar, parentage. 3. The question of unity or diversity of species, between two races, cannot be decided by the degree of difference w hich exists be- tween them ; for the answer to it entirely depends upon the constancy with which the peculiarity (of whatever nature it may be) is transmitted from parent to offspring, and upon the amount of variation which is exhibited even within the acknowledged limits of the i pVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1314 respective races. And thus a character which is perfectly valid in one group, may be en- tirely inapplicable in another. 4. Two races can only be regarded ' as specifically distinct, when the characters which separate them are transmitted with complete uniformity from parent to offspring; when there are no intermediate gradations tending to connect them; and when no such tendency to variation has manifested itself in either race, as shall make it probable, or, at any rate, possible, that their differences may be the direct result of external influences, or may be attributed to an unusual divergence in the characters of the offspring from those of the parents. 5. On the other hand, two races may un- doubtedly be regarded as specifically identical, when, however great the differences in stature, conformation, psychical character, &c, pre- sented by their respective types, these types are connected with each other by inter- mediate gradations, so close as to render it impossible to establish a definite boundary- line between the collections of individuals which are assembled around them. 6. Again, two races may be undoubtedly regarded as specifically identical, when in either race varieties present themselves, which ex- hibit the distinctive characters of the other race ; since we then have evidence, that, al- though these peculiarities are so generally transmitted from parent to offspring that each race possesses a certain degree of permanence, yet they are not thus uniformly inherited; and, consequently, there is nothing to pre- vent the transformation of the one race into the other, if the circumstances which have originated the variation, even in a single case, should act with sufficient potency on the whole mass. 7. No character can be safely adopted as justifying the assumption of the specific di- versity of two races, which has been found by experience to undergo considerable modifica- tion in either race, even though such mo- dification should not proceed to the extent of conversion into the character of the other ; for if a limited amount of change in external conditions be found capable of effecting a certain degree of alteration, the probability is strong that the higher difference may have had its origin in the more potent operation of the same class of causes. 8. The very fact of the extensive dispersion of a race, and of its existence under a great variety of external conditions, implies a marked capacity for variation ; since without such capacity, the race could not continue to flourish. 9. Among the conditions which most tend thus to produce varieties, within the limits of species, are those that are included under the general term domestication ; and the widest divergence among these varieties is to be found in those species, which are brought into the closest relation to Man. 10. Among the domesticated races of quad- rupeds, the characters most susceptible of variation are,— 1. Stature ; — 2. General con- formation of the body, as dependent upon the proportionate development of the limbs and trunk, the proportion of the breadth and thickness of bones to their length, the relative development of the soft tissues in different parts, &c. &c.;—3. Conformation of the skull, as shown especially in the relative development of the cranial and facial portions, the capacity of the cranial cavity, and the elongation of the muzzle ; — 4. Quantity, texture, and colour of the hairy covering ; — 5. Psychical character, as shown in the increase of intelligence, in the acquirement of new methods of action, and in the disappearance of some of the na- tural instinctive propensities. 11. In every race of domesticated animals, new varieties, departing more or less from the parent stock, in one or more of these charac- ters, are occasionally produced; some of these being directly traceable to the influence of external conditions, whose action upon a long succession of generations gradually mo- difies the character of that part of the race which is exposed to it; whilst others originate in the production of offspring, which, from some cause not understood, present a marked departure from the parental type. In the first case, the variety is permanent, that is, it tends to hereditary transmission so long as the same conditions exist ; and thus arise the peculiar adaptations between the characters and constitutions of races, which have been dispersed through regions very dissimilar in their physical conditions, and the climate, food, &c, to which they have been respec- tively habituated. In the second case, the variety is transitory, the individual peculiarity tending to disappear in the course of two or three generations, by becoming merged in the more general type ; but if it should happen that the individuals thus distinguished should breed together, the peculiarity shows a ten- dency to perpetuation by hereditary trans- mission ; and thus an entirely new race may originate, which remains distinct so long as it is not allowed to breed with others. 12. The several races of any kind of do- mesticated animals, which, according to the foregoing criteria, are accounted as belonging to the same species, breed freely and sponta- neously with each other, when allowed to do so ; and the offspring are fertile, not only with either of the parent races, but with each other. The mixed races thus originating, it may be added, frequently surpass either of their parent stocks, not only in the advanta- geous combination of different attributes, but also in general vigour, and in procreative capacity ; so that the mixture of races which are specifically identical, tends to the multi- plication of the species as a whole. 13. On the other hand, although propaga- tion may take place between individuals of undoubtedly distinct species, yet there is little spontaneous tendency to such admix- ture ; for each animal will select one of its ow n species for sexual intercourse, in preference to one of another species ; and it is, con-1315 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. sequently, only when restricted by artificial interference, that a male and a female of different species are disposed to copulation with each other. The hybrid offspring of this act partake of the characters of both the parent stocks, but are deficient in genera- tive power; so that, although a mule may be fertile when paired with an individual of either of the parent races, it is seldom or never fertile with one of its own kind. Thus the peculiarities introduced by hybridity are speedily merged into those of the parent stocks ; and no new race has ever been known to originate from this kind of union.* 14. Among all those races which are en- titled to rank as varieties only, the physiological conformity is often closer than the structural ; thus, as Dr. Pilchard has pointed out " the great laws of the animal economy, all the principal facts which relate to the natural and vital functions, the periods and duration of life, the economy of the sexes, the pheno- mena of parturition and reproduction, are, with slight deviations resulting from external agencies, constant and uniform in each par- ticular species." 15. So, again, among the varieties of the Fig. 803. Negro of Bournou. {From a portrait taken points of difference are never obliterated. But among these types we should find so wide a diversity, that we should naturally be led to question their relationship to each other and to ourselves ; and should seek to determine whether these differences are in- herent and unalterable in each race, so as to * It is not quite certain whether mule or hybrid Animals have ever produced fertile offspring when matched with each other; but it is quite certain that if a second generation of hybrids has thus been engendered, a third has never been, the race having no capacity for perpetuation.

III. General Survey of the Diversities, in Physical and Psychical Charac- ters, presented by the different Races of Mankind. If it were possible to bring together under one view, characteristic examples of every type of Human conformation which the pro- gress of Ethnological research has hitherto made known, it would be found that they all accord in the peculiarities by which Man has been shown (Sect. 1.) to be dis- tinguished from even the highest of the Quadrumanous order ; and that, notwith- standing a certain amount of approximation which is presented to that order in the aspect of certain human countenances {figs. 803, 804, 805.), and even in the habits of life of cer- tain tribes, yet the essential and fundamental Fig. 804. under the direction of Prof. Milne-Edwards.) forbid the idea of any essential modification, either in the past or the future, from the in- fluence of external circumstances ; or whe- ther there is any probable evidence that they may have been produced by those external agencies, which we have seen to possess such a remarkable power of altering the conforma- tion, and even the instinctive propensities, of domesticated animals. Such is the first ques- tion which we should have to answer ; and in a practical point of view, as influencing our conduct towards the races which differ more or less widely from our own, it is undoubtedly the most important. But the physiologist and the zoologist seek to attain a more positive scientifc determination of this rela- tionship ; and since, if such a determination 4 p 2VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1316 can be attained, the practical question is at once and completely settled, we shall apply Fig. 805. \ Tasmanian female. {From the " Atlas du Voyage de rAstrolabe.") What, then, is the true zoological relation- ship between these different races, so dissi- milar in colour, features, bodily conformation, stature, habits of life, and moral and intel- lectual cultivation ? Have we any ground to consider them as distinct species ? or are we to regard them as varieties of one and the same species? Are the fair Circassian and the jet- black African, the olive Malay anil the red American, the dusky New Zealander and the florid Saxon, all of one original stock ? Did the Patagonians, whose average height is nearly six feet, spring from the same parents with the pigmy Bosjesmans, whose usual height is under five, that of the females rarely much exceeding four ? Are the fat, blubber- fed, flat-visaged Esquimaux even most distantly related to the lean, date-eating, hatchet-faced Arab ? " Does the Bosjesman, who lives in holes and caves, and devours ants' eggs, locusts, and snakes, belong to the same species as the men who luxuriated in the hanging gardens of Babylon, or walked the olive-grove of Academe, or sat enthroned in the imperial homes of the Caesars, or reposed in the mar- ble palaces of the Adriatic, or held sumptuous festivals in the gay salons of Versailles ? Can the grovelling Wawa, prostrate before his fetish, claim a community of origin with those whose religious sentiments inspired them to pile the prodigious temples of Thebes and Memphis, to carve the friezes of the Parthe- non, or to raise the heaven-pointing arches of Cologne ? That ignorant Ibo, muttering his all-but inarticulate prayer, is he of the same ultimate ancestry as those who sang deathless strains in honour of Olympian Jove, or of Pallas Athene ; or of those who, in a purer worship, are chanting their glorious hymns or solemn litanies in the churches of Christendom ? That Alfouro woman, with ourselves to the search for it, as fully as our present limits permit. Fig. 806. Aramanga youth. {From a portrait in Dr. Picker- ing's " Natural History of Man." ) her flattened face, transverse nostrils, thick lips, wide mouth, projecting teeth, eyes half closed by the loose swollen upper eyelids, ears circular, pendulous, and flapping ; the hue of her skin of a smoky black, and, by way of ornament, the septum of her nose pierced with a round stick some inches long, —is she of the same original parentage as those whose transcendent and perilous beauty brought unnumbered woes on the people of ancient story, convulsed kingdoms, entranced poets, and made scholars and sages forget their wisdom ? Did they all spring from one common mother ? Were Helen of Greece, and Cleopatra of Egypt, and Joanna of Arragon, and Rosamond of England, and Mary of Scotland, and the Eloisas, and Lauras, and Ianthes, — were all these, and our poor Alfouro, daughters of her who was ' fairest of all her daughters, Eve ?' The Quaiqua or Saboo, whose language is described as con- sisting of certain snapping, hissing, grunting sounds, all more or less nasal, — is he, too, of the same descent as those whose eloquent voices ' fulmined over Greece,' or shook the forum of Rome, or as that saint and father of the church sumamed the 'golden-mouthed,' or as those whose accents have thrilled all hearts with indignation, or melted them with pity and ruth, in the time-honoured halls of Westminster ?"* This question is capable of being considered under a great variety of aspects. There are many very excellent persons, who think it quite sufficiently answered by the authority of the Scriptural narrative, and who maintain that to this authority all opposing considerations * From an Introductory Lecture, entitled " Our Institution and its Studies; " by Dr. J. A. Syniouds. Bristol, 1850.1317 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 4 p 3 must give way. But, on the other hand, the conviction is now fast spreading among en- lightened thinkers, that the Scriptures are no more intended to teach men Ethnology than to instruct them in Geology or Astronomy; and that the former, like the latter, is a legitimate object of scientific investigation, and should be pursued without fear as to the results. Any attempt, in fact, to fetter the scientific inquirer by the supposed authority of inspira- tion, is certain to damage the latter in the estimation of the most intelligent part of man- kind ; for, as has been well remarked by a very orthodox theologian, Dr. Henry More, " the unskilful insisting of our divines upon the literal sense of Moses has bred many hundred thousands of atheists." But even those who profess to place the most implicit confidence in the declarationsof'the Scriptures, as to the common origin of all the races of mankind, do, in effect, get rid of all the force of these declarations, when it suits their pur- pose to do so, by the mode of interpreting them which they adopt. They assert that the Adamic race does not include the barbarous inhabitants of remote regions; and that Ne- groes, Hottentots, Esquimaux, and Austra- lians are not, in fact, men in the full sense of the term, or beings endowed with mental faculties similar to our own. They contend that these and other uncivilised tribes are inferior in their original endowments to the proper human family, which supplied Europe and Asia with inhabitants ; and that, being organically different, they are separated by an " impassable barrier" from the race which dis- plays in the highest degree all the attributes of humanity, and can never be raised to an equality with it. They maintain that the ultimate lot of the ruder tribes is a state of perpetual servitude ; and that if, in some in- stances, they should continue to repel the attempts of the civilised nations to subdue them, they will at length be rooted out and exterminated from every country on whose shores Europeans shall have set their feet. Now if the distinct origin of these tribes be admitted, — if we are to regard the Negro and Australian, not as our fellow-men, brethren of the same great family as ourselves, but as beings of an inferior order, — and if duties towards them were not contemplated, as we may in that case presume them not to have been, in any of the positive commands on which the morality of the Christian world is founded, our relations to those tribes will ap- pear not to be very different from those which we might consider ourselves to hold towards the higher races of brutes. If such races be not men, then the golden rule, " Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them," is not applicable to our intercourse with them. We can scarcely imagine a Grotius or a Puffendorf, or any other great jurist, attempting to determine the jus belli or 2>ac>s between ourselves and a tribe of orangs, who had just sense enough to pass for men, and began to be suspected of the cheat, — which is nearly the true character of the Negroes, if those are right who maintain the doctrines just alluded to. And we may go a step further, and assert that there is, in such a case, no moral principle winch should prevent a hungry wanderer in Negroland or Australia from satisfying his appetite, by killing and eating the first native he might happen to meet. Thus, then, the widest extremes of opinion, and the greatest diversity in those rules of conduct which are founded upon such opi- nions, may exist among those who profess the most implicit reverence for the scriptural die* turn, that " God hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth." For, whilst some include under the term "men," all the individuals grouped together by the naturalist under the genus homo, and regard this genus as consisting of but a single species, of which the several races are only to be ranked as varieties, others assert that this genus includes several species, which form a gradual transition from the highest and most cultivated races of mankind, to those degraded races, which (as they affirm) have more in common with the brutes ; the former alone being really entitled to the appellation men, whilst the latter should be called by some other name indicating their close affinity to chimpanzees and orangs. Thus we are thrown back upon scientific inquiry, as the only legitimate means of bringing this ques- tion to an issue ; and such an inquiry can only be rightly pursued, when it is prosecuted upon the broadest possible basis, and is made to comprehend every kind of information which can be brought to bear upon it. Nothing can be easier than to bring together an ex parte collection of facts, which shall give to either doctrine, — that of the specific unity, or that of the specific diversity, of the human races, — an apparently fair claim to recep- tion. But since both cannot be true, and since the question can only be decided by the balance of probabilities, no evidentiary fact having any relation to the subject ought to be left out of view ; and thus the science of Ethnology must be built upon the foundation afforded by numerous other departments of scientific inquiry. The anatomist examines the configuration of the body, and compares the peculiarities of the various tribes, with the view of determining how far structural dif- ferences prevail over resemblances, and of ascertaining whether these differences possess that constant and untransitive character, which the naturalist requires as a justification of specific distinction. The physiologist searches into the history of the vital functions in the several types of humanity, and seeks for in- formation with regard to the permanence of anatomical differences, the effects of external agencies in modifying the configuration or constitution of the body, and the tendency to spontaneous variation in the forms presented by individuals, families, or tribes,known to be of the same stock. The psychologist has a most interesting subject of investigation, in the study of the psychical constitution of theVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1318 several races, and in the extraction (so to speak) of their respective mental and moral characters, from their habits of life, their languages, and their religious observances. It is his business to inquire how far one com- mon psychical character can be inferred from such diverse manifestations ; that is, how far the differences which he cannot but observe in intellectual capacity, and in moral and even instinctive tendencies, are fixed and per- manent, or are liable to spontaneous variation, or to alteration from the modifying influence of education and other external conditions. The physical geographer lends his aid, by bringing to bear upon the inquiry his know- ledge of the outward circumstances under which these variations in bodily and mental constitution are most constantly found. And it is from the materials which he contributes, that the physiologist and the anatomist have to determine the degree in which these cir- cumstances can be justly considered as the causes of variation; and, more especially, whether the coincidences between particular bodily configurations or mental constitutions, and certain combinations of climatic and geo- logical conditions, are the result of induced differences among the human races which are respectively subject to the latter, or are to be attributed to the implantation of originally dissimilar stocks in the respective localities in which their descendants are now found. But in order to carry on these researches, the information of the historian is continually needed, on the actual descent, migrations, conquests, &c. of the nations whose physical and mental characters we are comparing. The question of the fixity of all or any of the characters by which the races of mankind are at present distinguished from each other, requires for its solution a comparison of the present with the past. No valid proof of their permanence can be drawn from the limited experience of a few generations; and no evidence of change can be reasonably looked for, except under the long-continued agency of modifying causes. The required information is sometimes supplied by direct historical testimony ; but this is frequently insufficient, and recourse must be then had to the philologist, who derives from the compara- tive study of the languages of different tribes, most important evidence as to their degree of filiation, and thus extends, combines, and con- firms the indications, which the historian had drawn from other sources. Independent of the aid which philological research affords to other departments of ethnology, it directly bears upon the great problem of the unity or identity of mankind ; for it not only answers a common purpose with historical testimony, in establishing the genealogical relations of tribes long since dispersed from their original centres, and separated at present by strongly- marked physical and psychical differences ; but it also affords important evidence as to the fundamental similarity, if not identity, of the primitive stocks. It is obviously impossible to enter at any length into any one of these topics of inquiry, within the limits of the present article ; and all that will be here attempted, will be to place before the reader a general resume of the whole subject, carrying out those portions into some- what more of detail, in which the anatomist and physiologist are most concerned. The question at issue has usually been con- sidered under the simple aspect of specific unity or diversify ; — that is, in the first place, whether all the existing races may be sup- posed to be the descendants of one pair of "protoplasts ;" all their diversities in physical conformation, in language,in mental character, and in social condition, having since arisen ; — or whether, secondly, the existing races must be regarded as having sprung from several distinct pairs of protoplasts ; which originally presented differences amongst themselves, nearly the same with those which now exist amongst the races that seem most remote from each other. Now the first of these suppositions requires that evidence should be given of a very considerable amount of vari- ability from the original type (whatever that may have been) amongst the descendants from the common ancestry : whilst the second is based on the idea, that the leading characters which now separate the different races are per- manent, and must have been presented by their original progenitors. A third supposition, which has been put forward within the last few years, regards the existing races as not all proceeding from one pair of " protoplasts," but from several; but considers that these, though scattered over the globe, were funda- mentally similar in corporeal and mental con- stitution, and differed only in the adaptation of certain of their physical characters to the different circumstances of their several abodes, — thus being all comprehensible within the limits of one species,— and all possessing, too, a certain capacity for variation, which has been manifested in the production of subor- dinate diversities, and has even proceeded, in some instances, under the prolonged influence of change of climate, civilization, &c, to soften down, if not entirely to obliterate, the original differences. On the general bearing of the last of these hypotheses, a few remarks seem called for. Although the same affinity or blood-rela- tionship would not exist between the de- scendants of several distinct pairs of " proto- plasts," as between those of a common ancestry, yet the moral relations between them would be as close as on the supposition of their consanguinity. For, as has been justly observed, " the moral rights of men depend on their moral nature; and while Africans have the hearts and consciences of human beings, it could never be right to treat them as domestic cattle or as wild fowl, if it were ever so abundantly demonstrated that their race was but an improved species of ape, and ours a degenerate kind of god."* This view has recently been very forcibly * New Quarterly Review, No. XV. p. 131.1319 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 4 P 4 urged by Professor Agassiz, who has adopted in regard to the human races the same views as he has put forth with respect to many other species (p. 1310.) ; and who thus upholds the " unity of mankind," whilst contending for the diversity of " protoplasts." " We recognise," he says, " the fact of the unity of mankind. It excites a feeling that raises men to the most elevated sense of their connec- tion with each other. It is but the reflection of that Divine nature which pervades their whole being. It is because men feel thus related to each other that they acknowledge those ob- ligations of kindness and moral responsibility which rest upon them in their mutual relations. And it is because they have this innate feeling, that they are capable of joining in regular societies, with all their social and domestic affinities. This feeling unites men from the most diversified regions. Do we cease to recognise this unity of mankind, because we are not of the same family, because we ori- ginate in various countries, and are born in America, England, Germany, France, Switzer- land ? Where the relationship of blood has ceased, do we cease to acknowledge that ge- neral bond which unites all men of every na- tion? By no means. This is a bond which every man feels more and more, the farther he advances in his intellectual and moral culture, and which in this development is continually placed upon higher and higher ground ; so much so, that the physical relation arising from a common descent is finally entirely lost sight of, in the consciousness of the higher moral obligations. It is this consciousness which constitutes the time unity of mankind." This unity, he continues, may become a yet stronger bond of moral affinity, than that afforded by community of descent. " Where men of the same nation, individuals whose studies, whose calling in life have developed in them the same faculties, the same feelings, are brought closely together, relations spring up between them so intimate as by far to outweigh the natural bonds which a com- mon parentage may establish between men. Such individuals do not feel themselves to be near each other, do not sympathise in their aspirations, do not join in the same purposes, because they are brothers, because they belong to the same family, because they are of the same nation ; but because they feel that they are men, and that the natural dispositions wherewith they are endowed as men are de- veloped in them in a similar manner, and with reference to the same great human interests. Is there any one who would consider the ties between two such individuals on that intel- lectual and moral ground, as lessened because they may not be physically related at all ? or who would consider the differences in their physical features as an objection to their being more intimately connected than other men who in features resembled them more, or are related to then) more closely, perhaps by the nearest ties of blood ? We can therefore take it as a matter of fact, that, as we find men actually living together in the world, it is not the physical relation which establishes the closest connection between them, but that higher relation arising from the intellectual constitution of man." Professor Agassiz then refers to various departments of Natural His- tory, as affording proof " that the closest and most intimate unity may exist without a com- mon origin, without a common descent, with- out that relationship which is often denoted by the expression ' ties of blood.' On the other hand, that these ties of blood may exist, without necessarily calling forth the higher connections which may be found between in- dividuals of the same type, is, alas ! too plainly shown by the history of mankind. The im- mediate conclusion from these facts, however, is the distinction we have made above, that to acknowledge a unity in mankind, to show that such a unity exists, is not to admit that men have a common origin, nor to grant that such a conclusion may be justly derived from such premises. We maintain, therefore, that the unity of mankind does not imply a com- munity of origin for men ; we believe, on the contrary, that a higher view of this unity of mankind can be taken, than that which is de- rived from a mere sensual connection; that we need not search for the highest bond of humanity in a mere animal function, whereby we are most closely related to the brutes."* The Anatomical differences by which the several races of Mankind are distinguished from each other, may be referred to the fo.l« lowing heads: — 1. Conformation of the cranium. 2. Conformation of the pelvis. 3. Conformation of other parts of the skeleton. 4. Colour of the skin. 5. Colour, texture, and mode of growth of the hair. By most writers on the diversities of mankind, the varieties which are observable in the conformation of the bony skeleton, and particularly in that of the cranium and pelvis, have been thought to furnish distinc- tive characters of more importance than those derived from the colour of the skin, or the texture of the hair; since, while a certain capability of alteration in the latter, under climatic influences, can scarcely be gainsayed, it might be supposed, a priori, that strongly marked peculiarities in the configuration of the skull, in the proportion of the parts of the body, and in the development of the brain, would be less likely to undergo alteration. Special attention will be here bestowed, there- fore, upon the first three of this series of characters. 1. Conformation of the Cranium. — In esti- mating the degrees of diversity presented by the skulls of various races, it is absolutely necessary that some definite method of com- parison should be fixed upon. The first attempt of this kind of which we have any account, was made by Camper; who main- * Christian Examiner, Boston, N.E. Jan. 1850.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1320 tained that the profile view is the most cha- racteristic, and that the " facial angles " of the different races vary so greatly and so con- stantly, that upon this character alone a valid distinction might be founded. By Blumen- bach, on the other hand, it was considered that the comparison of the breadth of the head, particularly as seen in the vertical aspect, is the method by which the most strongly-marked differences are brought into view. By Professor Owen the importance of the basal aspect has been especially dwelt upon, in his comparison of the skulls of the higher Quadrumana with that of Man, as more fully indicating the relative proportions and extent, and the peculiarities of formation, of different parts of the cranium, than any other method. By Dr. Pritchard, again, the importance of the front or facial view has been clearly shown, in regard, at least, to one variety of cranial conformation. Lastly, by Prof. Ret- zius, the length of the cranial cavity in pro- portion to its breadth is considered as the character of greatest importance; this being regarded by him as indicative of the relative development of the posterior lobes of the cerebral hemispheres, and of the degree in which they cover-in, or extend beyond, the cerebellum. As we have already seen, the superior development of these posterior lobes constitutes a marked difference between the cerebrum of Man and that of the higher Quadrumana ; and in this respect it would appear from the evidence afforded by cranial conformation *, that there is a marked differ- ence among the several races of mankind. The only method of comparison which can be fairly relied on, is that in which all the points of difference are taken into account; and as this has been done more fully by Dr. Prichard than by any other ethnologist, his arrangement will be taken as the chief guide in the present instance.—If we were to select from a large collection of human crania, brought together from all quarters of the globe, those which differed most widely from each other, and which might, therefore, be considered as types of certain peculiarities of conformation, and if we were then to com- pare these more closely, so as to eliminate those which might be regarded as presenting mixtures or combinations of the most di- vergent types (just as in studying the solar spectrum, the optical investigator eliminates all the colours which can be generated by ad- mixture, and leaves only the three primaries, red, blue, and yellow), we should find our- selves reduced at last to three forms, which would probably be the crania—(1) of a Negro of the Guinea coast, or of a Negrito of Australia, (2) of a Mongolian or Tun- gusian of Central Asia, or of an Esquimaux or Greenlander, •—and (3) of a native of Western or Southern Europe. The most marked feature of the first of these would be the projection of the jaws ; hence this type is called by Dr. Prichard the prog- nathous. That of the second would be the breadth and flatness of the face, which, with the narrowness of the forehead, gives to the facial aspect somewhat of a pyramidal form, which is the designation applied to this Fie. 807.

The third form would not be distinguished by any particular fea- * The author would remark, however, that this evidence cannot by any means be implicitly relied on ; since the relative positions of the different parts of t he encephalon may vary, without a corresponding alteration in their development, as is seen when the form of the cranium has been altered by compres- sion. Of the fallacy of inferences drawn from an inspection of the cranium, as to the development of the different parts of the encephalon, we have an example in the assertion of Gall, that castration oc- casions atrophy of the cerebellum; a statement which has been completely negatived by the ob- servations of Leuret. tures so much as by an absence of the longi- tudinal projection of the first, or the lateral projection of the second, and by a general symmetry of the whole configuration, which maybe characterised as oval or elliptical; such being the form presented when the cranium is viewed either facially, basally, or vertically. The distinctive characters of these three types will now be more particularly considered ; and the European type may be conveniently taken as the standard of comparison, since it is in many respects intermediate between the two others; one of these departing from it in one direction, and the other in the opposite.1321 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. Of the Prognathous type. — The most marked feature of the typical prognathous skull, as already remarked, is the prominence of the jaws, as seen in profile {fig. 807). It is this which gives to the features of the Ne- gro and Australian their peculiar ugliness ; and it is on this that the difference of the facial angle between the Negro and the Eu- ropean chiefly depends. In both jaws we observe that the alveolar ridges project in such a manner, that the front teeth implanted in theni meet at an angle, instead of being in the same, or in parallel planes, as in those skulls which are termed for the sake of dis- tinction, orthognathic. Independently of the projection of the muzzle, however, there is an appearance of general elongation of the cranium from back to front,so that the antero- posterior diameter of the cranial cavity is greater in proportion to the lateral, than it is in the oval cranium. Thus the average length of ten Negro skulls measured by Pro- fessor Van der Hoeven*, was 6*90 inches, while their average breadth was 5*11 inches; so that the relation of their length to their breadth was as 1-36 to 1-00. On the other hand, the average length of twenty European skulls was 7*04 inches, and their breadth 5*47 inches ; so that the relation of their length to their breadth was 1*30 to 1*00. But this difference (which is by no means great) seems to depend rather upon the relative narrow- ness, than upon the elongation, of the Negro cranium ; for it will be observed that its ab- solute length is less than that of the European, and that the difference in the dimensions of the two consists chiefly in the inferior breadth. The form of the whole cranium suggests the idea of lateral compression. The tem- poral muscles cover a large surface, and rise high upon the parietal bones; and the zygo- matic arch has a large opening, but this is given by a forward rather than a lateral pro- jection of the cheek bones. Although the forehead very commonly recedes in the prog- nathous skull, this is by no means a constant character {fig. 810) ; even where it is high, however, it is seldom or never broad or full. The position of the foramen magnum has been affirmed to be, in the Negro, so far be- hind the nearly central place which it holds at the base of the European skull, as to constitute a marked character of approxi- mation to the quadrumanous type ; but it has been shown by Dr. Prichard, that, when due allowance is made for the projection of the alveolar processes, the position of the foramen magnum in the Negro is as central as in the other races f, its anterior border being immediately behind the trans- verse line bisecting the antero-posterior dia- meter of the base of the cranium. The height of the Negro skull seems to be rather less than that of the European ; but there is a more marked inferiority in the capacity * Bijdragen tot de Natuurlijke Gesehiedeniss van den Negerstam ; Leiden, 1842. f See Physical History of Mankind, vol. i. p. 200. of the Negro cranium, as shown by the length of the vault over the vertex, and in Fig. 810. Young Negro of Benguela. {After Mugendas.) the circumference; for the former averaged, in the measurements of Professor Van der Hoeven, 13*81 inches in the Negro, and 14-67 inches in the European ; whilst the average of the latter was 19*75 inches in the Negro, and 20*51 in the European. Although Pro- fessor Tiedemann attempted to prove *, by filling the cranial cavity with millet-seed, and then weighing the quantity which it was found to contain, that the capacity of the Negro's cranium is equal to that of the Eu- ropean's, yet, as Professor Van der Hoeven has pointed out, the average capacity of the Negro skulls thus examined by Tiedemann was about one-twentieth less than the average capacity of European skulls. On the other hand, the facial portion of the prognathous skull is relatively, and even absolutely larger. It has been usually described as being cha- racterised by the large relative size of the parts subservient to the organs of the senses ; but although it certainly appears that both the anterior and posterior nares are wider than in the European, that the nasal cavity is altogether more capacious (so as to allow a more extended surface for the distribution of the olfactive nerve), and that the external auditory meatus is remarkably large, it does not appear that the same holds good of the orbits, which, though sometimes larger, are sometimes smaller than in the average of Europeans. -J- This prognathous type, although most re- markably developed among the Negroes of the Delta of the Niger, is by no means confined to them, nor to the African races in general, of which it is usually regarded * Das Him des Negers, mit dem des Europaers unci Orang Outangs verglichen. Heidelberg: 1837. f See Prichard, op. cit. p. 292.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1322 as characteristic. Tt is met with among in- habitants of various quarters of the globe; but is nearly always associated with squalor and destitution, ignorance and brutality. In- stead of following an agricultural or pas- toral life, the people among whom it pre- vails are, for the most part, hunters, or inhabitants of low marshy forests, dependent for their supplies of food upon the chase, or upon the accidental produce of the soil, and but little advanced in any of the arts which are characteristic of civilisation. Such is the character of those aborigines of Australia, and of certain islands of the Polynesian Ar- chipelago, amongst whom the prognathous type is presented almost, if not quite, as characteristically as among the Negroes of the Guinea coast. The skulls of some of these inferior races have been asserted by Dr. JohnNeill * to pre- sent a division of the articulating surface of each occipital condyle into two facets, by a groove or ridge ; which appears to be the persistent indication of the fissure that originally separates the basi-occipital bone from the ex-occipitals. This character, how- ever, is far from being constant in any one family. Thus it was only found in 30 out of 81 African crania; whilst it presented itself in only 4 pure Egyptian heads in Dr. Mor- ton's collection, in 3 out of 105 skulls of aboriginal Americans, and in none of the other 129 skulls of different nations whose history was well known. Thus, although more common among the African races than in the others, and marking in them (like the occasional persistence of the separate inter- maxillary bone to a later period than usual) a less complete development, yet its presence in but little more than one-third even of the Negro-crania, and its occasional existence elsewhere, altogether destroy its title to be considered a mark of separation between dif- ferent branches of the human family. The writer has looked for this character in at least twenty African crania, without once meeting with it ; the only skull which unequivocally presented it being that of a Tasmanian female, set. 14.—Dr. Neill points out, also, that the lower boundary of the anterior nares in the Negro skull wants the sharp edge which is found in the higher races; and that this, also, may be regarded as a retention of the fcetal type. This character, however, is at least as strongly marked in Australians as in Negroes ; and an approximation to it is shown wherever there is a tendency to the prognathous conformation. Of the pyramidal type. — The most striking feature in this type of cranial conformation, which is best seen in the front and basal views {figs. 811. 813.), is the lateral or out- K?'81I. Fig. 812. Fig. 813. Pyramidal Cranium of Mongolian race. (From a specimen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.~) ward projection of the zygomatic arches ; this is principally due to the peculiar form of the malar bones, whose facial surface is very broad and flat ; but partly, also, to that of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, which forms a large rounded sweep. From this peculiarity, in conjunction with the nar- rowness of the forehead, it results that lines drawn from the zygomatic arches, touching the temples on either side, instead of being parallel, or nearly so, as amongst Europeans, meet at no great distance over the forehead, so as to form, with the line joining their bases, a triangular figure. The upper part of the face being remarkably flat, the nose also being flat, and the nasal bones, as well as the space * American Journal of the Medical Sciences, Jan. 1850. between the eyebrows, being nearly in the same plane with the cheek-bones, the trian- gular space bounded by these lines may be compared to one of the faces of a pyramid. This, however, is by no means the most im- portant peculiarity of this type; for the shortness of the antero-posterior diameter of the cranium, in relation to the lateral, is, as pointed out by Professor Retzius, at least equally characteristic. Thus the average length of sixteen Laplander's skulls measured by him was about 6-90 inches, while the average breadth was as much as 5-78 inches ; making the proportion of the former to the latter no more than 1*20 to 1-00. The greatest longitudinal dimension among all these skulls was only 7-08 inches, while the greatest late- ral extension was as much as 6-16 inches ; thus reducing the proportion to 1*15 to 1"00.1323 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. The orbits in these skulls are large and deep ; and the peculiar conformation of the hones which surround them give to the aperture of the lids an appearance of obliquity, the inner angle being directed downwards (7%. 814). Fig. 814. Portrait of one of the "Sianiese Twins." {Taken in Paris in 1830.) The whole face, instead of approaching the oval, as in Europeans, is of a lozenge-shape; and the greater relative development of the zygomatic bones, and of the bones of the face altogether, when compared with the capacity of the cranium, indicate in the pyramidal skull, as in the prognathous, a more ample develop- ment of the organs immediately subservient to sensation ; the lateral expansion being attended with a similar result in this respect, to that which is consequent upon the forward prolongation of the prognathous skulls. In the breadth of the lower jaw {.fig. 813) a remarkable contrast will be noticed with that of the prognathous type {fig. 809). The greater part of the races representing the pyramidal type in a well marked degree, may be designated as pastoral nomades ; some of them wandering with their flocks and herds over the vast plains of high Asia, whilst others creep along the shores of the Icy sea, supporting themselves partly by fishing, but living in part upon the flesh of their rein-deer. As in the preceding case, however, the same type is encountered in a remote quarter of the globe, among tribes whose descent would seem to be altogether different, yet which closely corresponds with the nomadic races of high Asia as to the physical conditions under which they live ; namely, the Hottentots of South Africa, whose resemblance to Mon- golians in cranial conformation, as well as in complexion, hair, and several other charac- ters, is so striking as to have been noticed by all travellers familiar with both, and to have given rise to many speculations as to their possible blood-relationship. It will be here- after shown, however, that there is no valid reason for separating the Hottentots from the general mass of the African nations ; and just as the Australians repeat the progna- thous type at a distance from its chief centre, with a slight admixture of the pyramidal, so do the Hottentots in some degree repeat the pyramidal, with an admixture of the prog- nathous. Of the Oval or Elliptical type. — This form of cranial configuration at once approves itself to the educated eye, as distinguished by its symmetrical contour; neither the muzzle nor the zygomatic arches having an undue prominence, whilst, on the other hand, there is no appearance of flattening or compression. The cranium, in its fullest development, may be said to have the length of that of the Negro with the breadth of that of the Mongolian; and it is particularly distinguished by the lateral fulness, as well as by the elevation, of the forehead. This will be especially appa- rent on the comparison of fig. 815 with Fia. 815. Fie. 816. Fie. 817. Elliptical Cranium of European. (From a specimen in the 3Iuseum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) the corresponding view in Jigs. 807. and 811.; for in the former it will be seen that the breadth continues to increase above the orbits, and that the cranial vault is rounded and capacious ; whilst in the other two, the frontal region, from the floor of the orbits upwards. The form of the zygomatic arches is such, that in the facial view they do not project laterally beyond the general boundary line, as they do in the Mongolian ; whilst the breadth diminishes rapidly, especially in the conformation of the jaws is such, that they1324- VARIETIES OF MANKIND. do not form nearly as great a projection be- yond the ellipse which would include the whole cranium and the greater part of the face, when seen in profile, as they do in the Negro. Owing to the more perpendicular direction of the alveolar processes, the front teeth of the two jaws are fixed in planes ■which are nearly or quite parallel to each other. The chief positive distinction of this form of cranium, is the large development of the cranial cavity, and especially the fullness and eleva- tion of the forehead, in proportion to the size of the face; indicating the predominance of the intellectual powers over those merely instinctive propensities which are more di- rectly connected with sensations. Among European nations, the Greeks have probably displayed the greatest symmetry in the form of the head, in the largest proportion of in- dividuals ; but examples of equal symmetry might be found amongst any of the great group of nations now termed Indo-Atlantidae, and even, as will hereafter appear, in na- tions of entirely different descent. Nearly all of these have acquired a certain amount of civilisation, living by agriculture, and possessing settled habitations ; and among them, or among the offsets which have pro- ceeded from them (as the people of the United States), we find all the nations which have been most distinguished for intellectual advancement, for the successful cultivation of the fine arts, and for the various improve- ments which distinguish the state of civilisa- tion from that of barbarism. To the foregoing general account of the three principal types of cranial conformation, may be added the results of the observations recently made public by Dr. Morton *, as to the capacity of the cranium of different races, measured after the manner adopted by Tiede- mann (p. 1321.). The number of crania ex- amined was 623 ; and they were derived from various races and families, as shown in the following table, which is here given without modification, although the writer (as will hereafter appear) is far from agreeing with Dr. Morton in the classification of these varieties which he has adopted. It appears from this comparison, that the Teutonic race, and the nations chiefly de- rived from it, take the highest rank among those examined in regard to cranial capacity ; whilst the lowest is occupied not by the Negroes, but by the Hottentots, the Austra- lians, and the ancient Peruvians and Mexi- cans. The Negro race seems to be scarcely or not at all inferior in this particular to the Per- sians, the Bengalees, the Fellahs, the ancient Egyptians, the modern Fellahs, the Chinese, the Polynesians, and the North American In- dians. It must be remarked, however, that the number of crania examined is too small, in some of the families, to admit of a fair aver- age. This, however, it is most important to * Transactions of the American Medical Associ- ation, vol. iii. p. 57.

Australians 8 83 63 75 observe, that in the skull of largest capacity amongst the races whose average is the loivest, the cubical content is greater than that of the smallest skull among the highest. Thus we see that the largest native African skull contained 99 cubic inches; the largest Ame- rican-born Negro, 89 cubic inches ; and the largest Hottentot and Alforian skulls, 83 cubic inches; whilst, on the other hand', the smallest German skull contained but 70 cubic inches ; the smallest English, 91 inches ; and the smallest Anglo-American, 82 cubic inches. It is worthy of note, too, that the largest Negro skull possesses two inches more capa-1325 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. city than the largest Anglo-American. It is obvious, then, that no constant and impass- able line of distinction can be drawn on this basis, between any of the varieties of the human race. We have now to inquire if the foregoing types of cranial conformation are sufficiently fixed and definite to furnish specific characters ; that is (1.), whether they are always clearly distinguishable from each other, or are con- nected together by a succession of gradations that renders it impossible to draw a distinct line of demarcation between them : and (2.) whether they are so invariably transmitted from one generation to another, where the purity of the race has been preserved, as to entitle them to be regarded as permanent and unalterable ; or are occasionally seen to vary in a succession of generations, so that a race loses more or less completely its original type, and assumes some other. When the cranial conformation of the whole Indo"Atlantic group of nations is care- fully examined, it is perceived that although the elliptical type prevails among them, it is comparatively seldom seen in its perfection, and that a decided tendency is frequently seen towards one or other of the other types, or towards a mixture of the characters of all. Considerable variation is thus presented, not merely by the different races, but by different individuals of the same race. Thus in every large collection of English skulls, for example, crania would probably be found differing nearly as widely from each other in the proportion of length to breadth, as do the average of Negro and Mongolian crania; whilst, again, some would exhibit more or less of approximation to the prognathous type, and others to the pyramidal. Of the former we have an example in Jig. 818., and Fig. 818.

Bradii/cephalic Cranium of an Englishman. {From a specimen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) sions of its cranial portion were alone re- garded, in the " dolichocephalic " division of Professor Retzius, and only wants a little more elongation of the muzzle to be almost as prognathous as many African skulls ; whilst in the second, the breadth and front-flattening of the malar bones, with the inferior breadth of the forehead, show that it is obviously in- termediate in character between the typical oval (Jig. 815) and the typical pyramidal (fig. 811). So, again, if the so-called Mon- golian group be surveyed, it will be found that the peculiarities of the pyramidal skull are often softened down, so as to present an approach to the elliptical form, sometimes through the whole of certain races, occasion- ally only in individuals. Here, too, there is a tendency to an admixture of types ; for we find among the American nations a very- gradual transition from the truly pyramidal, such as is seen in the Esquimaux (Jig. 820), Fig. 820. Cranium of Esquimaux. (From a specimen hi the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) to a form in which there is at least as great an admixture of the prognathous (Jig. 822); whilst among the Chinese and other civilised nations of South-eastern Asia, we find so close an approximation to the oval type, that individuals are not unfrequently met with amongst them, whose skulls might be taken for those of Europeans.* So, again, if we * Such was the case, for example, with the Chinese skull, whose measurements are given by Professor Van der Hoeven (op. cit.); for in every one of its dimensions it varied less from the aver-1326 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. Fin. 821. Fig. 822. Cranium of Masacusi Indian. (From a specimen in the Museum of the Royal College o f Surgeons.) take a survey of the African nations, we find the prognathous type gradually softened down (so to speak) among them, until in some of the races of undoubted African descent, in- habiting the Nile valley, it merges into the oval. We have already noticed the curious admixture of the pyramidal and prognathous types which is seen in the Hottentot races ; and among the widely spread and isolated tribes by which Oceania is peopled, the same com- bination is exhibited in various degrees. For Fig. 823. whilst the skulls of the Malayan portion of the population are referable to the pyramidal type rather than to any other, those of many native Australians, and of various islanders designated as " Pelagian Negroes," are almost purely prognathous, presenting but a very slight indication of a pyramidal tendency about the upper part of the face ; and between these there is every degree of gradation. Thus, in the Australian skull, delineated in figs. 823, 824, there is decidedly less prognathism Fig. 824.. Cranium of Aboriginal Australian. {From a specimen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.') than in that already described (Jig. 808.) ; and in the skull of the Tahitian (Jig. 825), with about the same amount of prognathism, there Fig. 825. Cranium of a Tahitian. (From a specimen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) is a considerably less degree of antero- posterior elongation ; in both these skulls, age of European skulls, than the latter varied from each other. moreover, the upper part of the face, when seen in front, shows a decidedly pyramidal tendency. So, again, the Greenlanders are ranked by Professor Retzius among his Do/i- chocephalcB prognathic, along with the Negroes and Australians, although the upper part of the face is often most characteristically pyra- midal ; and even the Brachiocephalic Tartars and Kalmuks are reckoned by him suffi- ciently prognathous to be separated from the Finns, Lapps, Turks, &c. These facts, to which many more might be added, should be sufficient to convince every philosophic naturalist, who duly estimates what is required for the establishment of spe- cific distinctions, that none such can be laid down among the different races of mankind, upon the foundation of cranial conformation alone. Those ethnologists who hold the doctrine of originally distinct stocks, which (they maintain) have continued to preserve their characteristic features through succes- sive generations, have been obliged to admit, not three or five varieties of cranial conform-VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1327 ation, but twenty or thirty ; and as we in- crease our acquaintance with the physical characters of tribes at present little known, the number requires continual enlargement. And whether the types selected be few or many, they are always found to be con- nected by such a gradation of intermediate or transitional forms, that the well-marked boundary-lines which are necessary for the limitation of species, cannot be drawn with the slightest show of justification. It is not meant to be here asserted, that the absence of any such definite peculiarities of cranial con- formation is of itself a sufficient reason for regarding the several races of mankind as specifically identical. On the contrary, as we have already seen, the genus Fclis contains species as unmistakeably distinct as the lion and the tiger, between which there is no appreciable difference in cranial conformation All that we have a right to affirm is (I.), that the most extreme differences in the configura- tion of the skull, existing among the several races of men, are not greater than those which present themselves among races of domesti- cated mammals known to have had a common origin (e.g. those of the hog), and are not nearly so great as those existing among other races of mammals (as the various breeds of dog,) which are generally believed to have had a common origin; and (2.) that, as in the case of the domesticated races, the distinctive characters are by no means clearly marked out, but that those of the typical forms are softened down in intermediate gradations, so as to present a continuous series from one type to another, in which no such hiatus is left, as would justify the assumption of the specific distinctness of those types. This last fact of itself invalidates that supposition of the uniform transmission of physical cha- racters from parent to offspring, on which the presumption of original distinctness mainly rests. For, on the theory of specific distinct- ness, all the descendants of the same parentage should repeat the characters of their ances- tors without essential modification ; whereas we find, as a matter of fact, that the distinc- tive characters are perpetuated in their full intensity in only a small proportion of each race, and that in the great masses they are so shaded off as gradually to disappear. And this must be admitted, whatever types we may select as those representing the original species ; unless we go to the extreme length of selecting a distinct type for every distin- guishable mollification in the conformation of the skull, which would be a sort of reductio ad absurdum of the hypothesis. We are thus led to the second branch of the inquiry, namely, whether there is ade- quate evidence that the cranial characters of the several races are really thus transmitted, with little or no modification, from generation to generation, or whether an actual passage may be effected in time from one type to another. Now, every one who has been accustomed to discriminate the varieties of cranial conformation which present them- selves within his own range of observation, must have noticed that not only between the parents and their offspring, but also among the different children of the same parentage, a considerable diversity not unfrequently exists. Further, on looking at the various individuals composing the ramifications of a particular family, it is frequently observable that they agree among themselves in some peculiarity of cranial configuration, which seems (from the evidence of portraits, busts, &c.) to have been transmitted downwards for centuries; and by this very character it may be separated from other families, which are in like manner distinguished for their re- spective peculiarities. Now, there can be no reasonable doubt that many such families had originally a common ancestry, so that there must have been a time when each of these peculiarities first manifested itself in its own branch of the common stock; for, if this be not admitted, we must suppose each of them to have descended from a distinct pair of " protoplasts." It is obvious, then, that the question of possible modification is only one of degree ; and judging by the analogy of the domesticated races, by the amount of varia- tion exhibited under circumstances not very dissimilar, and by the considerations already advanced (p. 1303. ct scq.) respecting the pro- bable sources of such variations, we should be prepared to expect that even the widest diver- sities which have been described, might have been occasioned by the sufficiently-prolonged influence of external causes acting upon a succession of generations. That such has been the case to a considerable extent, would appear in some instances from the direct evi- dence of history; in other instances it would seem a necessary inference from the facts of philology; whilst in others, again, the two classes of evidentiary facts, neither of them sufficient in themselves, tend to confirm each other. One of the most striking examples of this kind is afforded by the change in cranial conformation from the pyramidal to the ellip- tical, as well as in other characters, especially the length and abundance of the beard,— which has taken place among the Turks of Europe and Western Asia. These so closely accord in physical characters with the great bulk of European nations, and depart so widely from the Turks of Central Asia, that many writers have referred the former to the (so-called) Caucasian, rather than to the Mongolian stock. Yet historical and philo- logical evidence sufficiently proves, that the Western Turks originally belonged to the Central Asiatic group of nations; with which the eastern portion of their nation still re- mains associated, not only in its geographical position, but in its language, physical charac- ters, and habits of life ; and that it is in the western branch, not in the eastern, that the change has taken place. Some writers have supposed that this change might be explained as the result of an intermixture of the Turkish race with the inhabitants of the countries theyVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1328 have conquered, or by the introduction of Georgian or Circassian slaves into their harems. But the cause suggested is plainly inadequate to the effect. For we know that in the Christian countries subjugated by the Turks, the conquering and the conquered races have been kept from properly domestic intermixture by mutual hatred, fostered by their difference in religion and manners ; and although Greek, Georgian, and Circassian females have been introduced into the harems of those who could afford to purchase them, yet any other modification which has been effected by their means must have had but an insignificant effect upon the mass of the population, since the pure Turkish descent of the poorer classes must have been but little interrupted, and universal experience shows that if the " cross-breeding " be not kept up, any new element introduced into a race speedily disappears. Even admitting that some modification may have been thus engen- dered, we cannot fairly attribute to it more than a very trifling share in the result ; since the effect of intermixture would simply have been to produce a hybrid or intermediate race, instead of the entire substitution of the elliptical type, which now manifests itself among the comparatively civilised Western Turks, whilst those which inhabit Central Asia, and retain the nomadic habits of their ancestors, have retained also their cranial conformation. Another instance of the same modification is to be found in the Magyar race, which forms a large part of the population of Hun- gary, including the entire nobility of that country. This race, which is not inferior in physical or mental characters to any in Europe, is proved by historical and philolo- gical evidence to have been a branch of the great Northern Asiatic stock, which was ex- pelled about ten centuries since from the country it then inhabited (which bordered on the Uralian mountains), and, in its turn, ex- pelled the Slavonian nations from the fertile parts of Hungary, which it has occupied ever since. Having thus exchanged their abode, from the most rigorous climate of the old Continent, — a wilderness in which Ostiaks and Samoiedes pursue the chase during only the mildest season, —for one in the South of Europe, amid fertile plains abounding in rich harvests, the Magyars gradually laid aside the rude and savage habits which they are recorded to have brought with them, and adopted a more settled mode of life. In the course of a thou- sand years, their type of cranial conformation has been changed from the pyramidal to the elliptical ; and they have become a handsome people, with fine stature and regular Euro- pean features, with just enough of the Tartar cast of countenance, in some instances, to recal their origin to mind. Here, again, it may be said that the intermixture of the con- quering with the conquered race has had a great share in bringing about this change ; but a similar reply must be returned ; for the existing Magyars pride themselves greatly on the purity of their descent; and the small infusion of Slavonic blood, which may have taken place from time to time, is by no means sufficient to account for the complete change of type which now manifests itself. The women of pure Magyar race are said by good judges to be singularly beautiful, far surpass- ing either German or Slavonian females. A similar modification, but less in degree, ap- pears to have taken place among the Finnish tribes of Scandinavia. These may be almost certainly affirmed to have had the same origin with the Lapps* ; but whilst the latter re- tain (although inhabiting Europe) the no- madic habits of their Mongolian ancestors, the former have adopted a much more settled mode of life, and have made considerable ad- vances in civilisation, especially in Esthonia, where they assimilate with their Russian neigh- bours. And thus we have in the Lapps, Finns, and Magyars, three nations or tribes, of whose descent from a common stock no reasonable doubt can be entertained, and which yet exhibit the most marked differences in cranial characters, and also in general con- formation, the Magyars being as tall and well- made, as the Lapps are short and uncouth. Another instance of the same kind, which is still more remarkable if it can be entirely substantiated, is the conversion of the Geor- gian and Caucasian nations from the pyra- midal or Mongolian to the elliptical or Indo- European type. The designation Caucasian seems to have been given to the latter on the following most unsatisfactory ground. " Blu- menbach had a solitary Georgian skull ; and that solitary skull was the finest in his collec- tion, that of a Greek being next. Hence it was taken as the type of the skull of the more organised divisions of the species. More than this, it gave its name to the type, and introduced the term Caucasian." f Now the fact is, that the Georgian and Circassian * This proposition, which is supported by the almost unanimous voice of the learned historians of Germany, was assailed a few years since by Profs. Nilson, Retzius, and other Scandinavian savans, who endeavoured to prove by archaeological and anatomical evidence, that the origin of the Finnish race was not the same with that of the Lapps, but that it was more nearly connected with the Swedish nation, which is a northern branch of the great Indo-European family. Much of the archajological evidence adduced, however, is capable of receiving a directly opposite interpretation; and the philo- logical evidence, derived from the comparative study of the Finnish and Swedish languages, shows that the basis of the former was essentially peculiar to it, and that the nature of the modification which it has undergone from Swedish influence, indicates a con- siderable advance in civilisation previously to the subjugation of the race by foreign invaders. Dr. Latham, the latest authority on this subject, ex- presses himself very decidedly as to the affinity of the Finns, Lapps, and Hungarians, whom he ranks with the Voguls, Ostiaks, and Permians, as off-sets of the Ugrian branch of the Turanian (Mongolian) stock.—See his Natural History of the Varieties of Man, p. 100. t Latham, op. cit. p. 108.1329 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. nations are composed of an assemblage of tribes inhabiting a mountainous country, speak- ing languages almost unintelligible to each other, and remarkably isolated from the na- tions which inhabit the countries border- ing on theirs. The beauty of form and feature, and the delicacy of complexion, which charac- terise individuals and families among these Fig. 826. Portrait of a young Circassian, belonging to the suite of the Persian Ambassador. (From a portrait taken in Paris by M. A. Colin.') tribes, are well known (Jig. 826.) and have led to a regular consignment of the 3011th of both sexes to the Turkish market, the females to be introduced into the harems, whilst the youths are valued for their superior energy and intelligence, and are frequently adopted as sons. But these attributes are for the most part confined to the families of the chiefs; and they are carefully cherished by exemp- tion from labour, and by seclusion from undue exposure. The common people, who are en- gaged in the cultivation of the soil, are de- scribed by travellers as being for the most part coarse and unshapely.—Now from a careful comparison and analysis of the lan- guages of these races, Dr. Latham and Mr. Norris have independently arrived, on different grounds (the one from the tvords and the other from the grammar), at the same result; namely, that they are aptotic, or destitute of inflexions, like the Chinese ; and that the people must have been of Mongolian origin, but separated from the common stock at a very early period ; the perpetuation of the low development of their language being fa- voured by the peculiar characters of the VOL. IV. country in which they located themselves, whilst these same characters tended to modify their physical conformation. For the area which they occupy is at once temperate, mountainous, and wooded ; " in other words," as Dr. Latham remarks, " the reverse of the true Mongol areas." And thus, if this view should be confirmed, we must regard the very people which has been selected as fur- nishing the type of the most perfect con- formation, as an improved race of a decidedly inferior stock. The Negro type is one which is not unfre- quently cited as an example of the perma- nence of the physical characters of races, and especially of types of cranial conformation. The existing Ethiopian physiognomy is said to agree with the representations transmitted to us from the remotest times in Egyptian pictures ; and this physiognomy, it is further maintained, continues to be transmitted un- changed from parent to child, even where the transportation of a Negro population to tem- perate climates and civilised associates (as in the United States of America) has entirely changed the external conditions of their ex- istence. Now it is perfectly true that the Negro races which continue to inhabit their original localities, and maintain their barba- rous habits of life, retain the prognathous type ; and this is precisely what we should expect. But it is not true that no modifica- tion has taken place in them, either under the influence of civilisation, or from a change in the physical conditions of their existence. For the most elevated forms of skull occurring among the African nations, are found in those which have emerged in a greater or less degree from their original barbarism; their civilis- ation having been due to external influences brought to bear upon them. We shall here- after see that there is strong evidence that even the Syro-Arabian or Semitic nations may be referred to the African stock; at any rate, there are numerous tribes in the interior of Africa, whose affinity with the true Negroes cannot be disputed, and which yet present a far superior cranial organisation ; so that we must either regard the one form to be the result of improvement, or the other to have preceded from degeneration. In regard to the transplanted Negroes, it is obvious that the time which has elapsed since their re- moval, is as yet too short to justify us in ex- pecting any considerable alteiation in cranial configuration. Many of the Negroes now living in the West Indian islands are natives of Africa ; and a hirge prt p >rtion of the Negro population, both there and in the United States, are removed by no more than one or two descents from their African progenitors. The climate, too, of the southern states of the North American Union, as of the West Indies, is not very different from that of the Guinea Coast, in regard to temperature ; and the low undrained character of much of the soil which they are employed in cultivating, still further tends to keep up the correspond- ence. Still, according to the concurrent 4 QVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1330 testimony of disinterested observers, both in the West Indies and in the United States, an approximation in the Negro physiognomy to the European model is progressively taking place, in instances in which, although there has been no intermixture of European blood, the influence of a higher civilisation has been powerfully exercised for a lengthened period. This is particularly the case with Negroes employed as domestic servants. Dr. Han- cock, a most intelligent physician of Guiana, even asserts that it is frequently not at all difficult to distinguish a Negro of pure blood, belonging to the Dutch portion of the colony, from another belonging to the English settle- ments, by the correspondence between the features and expression of each, and those which are characteristic of their respective masters. This alteration, too, is not confined to a change of form in the skull, or to a di- minution in the projection of the jaw ; but it is also seen in the general figure, and in the form of the soft parts, as the lips and nose. And the writer has been informed by Sir Charles Lyell, that during his recent tour in America, he was assured by numerous me- dical men residing in the slave states of the North American Union, that a gradual ap- proximation is taking place in the configura- tion of the head and body of the Negroes to the European model, each successive gene- ration exhibiting an improvement in these respects. The change is most apparent in such as are brought into closest and most habitual relation with the whites (as by do- mestic servitude), without any actual inter- mixture of races, which would be at once be- trayed by the change of complexion, and by the more strongly marked indications of hybridism. It is more easy to imagine that a pyramidal or a prognathous cranium can be metamor- phosed into an elliptical one, than that either of the two first-named forms can be converted into the other. Yet very strong evidence is furnished by philological considerations, that the Hottentot races constitute a branch of the common African stock ; and the approx- imation which their skulls present to the pyramidal type cannot be for a moment attri- buted to intermixture with any Mongolian race. On the other hand, among the in- habitants of Oceania, there are many races which present, more or less decidedly, the prognathous type ; and this sometimes asso- ciated with woolly or " frizzled," sometimes with long and straight hair. Yet there is strong philological evidence for regarding these as descendants of colonists who spread themselves (probably by various lines of migration) from south-eastern Asia, and who carried to the various islands of the vast Malayo-Polynesian Archipelago, the pyra- midal type more or less softened down. On no other hypothesis can the extraordinary community in the fundamental elements of their languages be accounted for, the tribes which use them being in a state of complete isolation from each other. Where, as is frequently the case, the same island or group is peopled by two or more races, having different physical characters, it is always found that the greatest tendency to the prognathous type shows itself among those which appear to have longest dwelt there in a state of barbarism; and that it is most strongly marked, when, to other degrading agencies, that of a low and marshy soil has been added. Even the elliptical type, as already re- marked, may occasionally present indications of degradation towards one of the others. Want, squalor, and ignorance, have a special tendency to induce that diminution of the cranial portion of the skull, and that increase of the facial, which characterise the prog- nathous type; as cannot but be observed by any one who takes an accurate and candid survey of the condition of the most degraded part of the population of the great towns of this country, but as is seen to be pre- eminently the case with regard to the lowest classes of Irish immigrants. A certain degree of regression to the pyramidal type is also to be noticed among the "nomadic" tribes which are to be found in every civilised community. Among these, as has been re- marked by a very acute observer, " accord- ing as they partake more or less of the purely vagabond nature, doing nothing whatsoever for their living, but moving from place to place, preying on the earnings of the more industrious portion of the community, so will the attributes of the nomade races be found more or less marked in them; and they are all more or less distinguished for their high cheek bones and protruding jaws * thus showing that kind of mixture of the pyra- midal with the prognathous type, which is to be seen among the most degraded of the Malayo-Polyncsian races. It has not been pointed out, so far as the writer is aware, by any ethnologist, that the conformation of the cranium seems to have undergone a certain amount of alteration even in the Anglo-Saxon race of the United States, which assimilates it in some degree to that of the aboriginal inhabitants. Certain it is, that, among New Englanders more particularly, a cast of countenance prevails, which usually renders it easy for any one familiar with it to point out an individual of that country in the midst of an assemblage of Englishmen ; and although this may chiefly depend upon the conformation of the soft parts, yet there is a certain sharpness, and an angularity of feature about a genuine " Yankee," which would probably display itself in the contour of the bones. So far as the writer's observation has extended, there is especially to be noticed an excess of breadth between the rami of the lower jaw, giving to the lower part of the face a peculiar squareness (something like that which is shown in fig.82]), that is in strik- ing contrast with the tendency to an oval * London Labour and the London Poor; by Henry Mayheiv, p. 2.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1331 4 Q 2 narrowing which is most common among the inhabitants of the " old country." And it is not a little significant, that the well-marked change which has thus shown itself in the course of a very few generations, should tend to assimilate the Anglo-American race to the aborigines of the country ; the peculiar phy- siognomy here adverted to, most assuredly presenting a transition, however slight, to- wards that of the North-American Indian. 2. Conformation of the Pelvis. — Certain differences in the pelvis have been thought to be characteristic of particular nations or groups of nations. According to Professor Vrolik*, who was the first to take up the enquiry systematically, the difference between the male and the female pelvis is much more strongly marked in the Negro than in the Eu- ropean. The pelvis of the male Negro, in the strength and density of its substance, and in the form of its component bones,resembles the pelvis of a wild beast ; while, on the contrary, the pelvis of the female of the same race com- bines lightness of substance and delicacy of form and structure. Notwithstanding this delicacy of conformation, it is considered by Professor Vrolik to present characters which indicate an approximation to that of the Quadrumana ; for the ossa ilii are unusually vertical in their direction, and the highest part of their crest is situated immediately above the posterior and upper tuberosity, instead of being midway between the anterior spine and posterior tuberosity ; the length of the an- tero-posterior diameter at the brim is very great in proportion to the transverse diameter; the sacrum is narrower, and the angle beneath the pubic articulation more acute; the whole pelvis is longer; but the diameters at the outlet are not sensibly different from those of the European pelvis. The conformation of the pelvis in the female Hottentot, who died in Paris in 1815, is considered by Professor Vrolik to present a still wider departure from the European form, and a correspondingly nearer approximation to the quadrumanous ; the ilia are so vertical in their direction, and are so much lengthened upwards, as to rise above the level of the middle of the fourth lumbar vertebra. In the Javanese (Malay), the pelvis is distinguished by its smallness, its peculiar lightness of substance, and the cir- cular form of its upper aperture; the pro- montory of the sacrum projects very little; and the ischiadic spines are remarkably turned inwards. A more extended comparison of the pelvis of different races, however, has been made by Professor M. I. Weber ; who classifies all the varieties he has met with under the four fol- lowing heads, which are named according to the form of the aperture of the brim : — 1. The oval, in which the aperture has somewhat the form of an egg, the narrowest end of the ellipse being at the symphysis * Platen behoorende tot de Beschowing van het Verschel der Bekfcens in onderscheidene Volkstam- men. Amsterdam: 1826. pubis : but the antero-posterior diameter is shorter than the transverse. 2. The round, in which the antero-pos- terior and transverse diameters are nearly equal. 3. The square, or four-sided ; in which the sides, especially that formed by the os pubis, are flat and broad, so that the aperture forms nearly a perfect square ; the transverse di- ameter is greater than the antero-posterior. 4. The oblong ; in which the sides are com- pressed, and the transverse diameter is con- sequently the least; the sacrum is narrow; and the angle at which the ossa pubis unite is very acute ; the ossa ilii are high, and nearer to each other than in the previous forms. Now, if any attempt be made to assign any one of these forms of pelvis to a particular nation or group of nations, it fails in toto ; because, although particular types are more common than others in each principal variety, yet each kind may present itself in other individuals of the same race. Thus, the oval type is most common in the European, where it is in accordance with the oval form of the skull ; but round, square, and wedge-shaped pelves also present themselves occasionally ; and the oval form is met with again in the pelvis of a Botacudo, a people reputed to be the most savage of all the American nations. The round type seems most frequent among the American and Malayan nations ; but it has been observed by Weber not merely in the European, but in a Negress,and in a female Hottentot. The square form seems most common among the nations with decidedly pyramidal skulls, especially the Northern Asiatics ; but it occurs also in Europeans, and in the mixed race of Mestizos. Finally, the oblong pelvis is most common among the African races, and is conformable to the elongated shape usually possessed by their crania ; but it has been observed also among Europeans and Botocudos.*—The writer's own observations, so far as they extend, con- firm this view, as to the conformity between the shape of the pelvis and that of the skull ; which renders it probable that the influences which affect the latter will modify the former also. 3. Conformation of other parts of the slce- leton.— Other characters have been at dif- ferent times adduced, as showing that the Negro and other degraded races are really to be considered as forming a distinct group, in- termediate between the higher specimens of humanity and the superior apes. Of these, the most important will be now inquired into. It was maintained by Soemmering, and since his time very generally believed, that the position of the foramen magnum in the Negro skull is intermediate between that which it holds in man, and that w hich it presents in the anthropoid Simias; but this, as already shown, is a mistaken view of the case; for, * Die Lehre von den Ur- und Kacenformen der Sehaedel und Becken des Menschen, von Dr. M. I. Weber. Dusseldorf: 1830.1332 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. if we make allowance for the projection of the jaws, and consider only its relation to the cranial portion of the skull, the position of the foramen magnum is found to be the same in the Negro as in the European; whilst in the adult forms of the highest apes, as shown by Professor Owen, it is removed very much further back, although in the young it is nearer the centre of the base. Again, it was stated by White, and has been generally believed, that the length of the fore arm in the Negro is so much greater than in the European, as to constitute a real approximation to the quadrumanous type. But an extended com- parison proves, that only a very slight differ- ence exists between the average length of this part in the two races ; and that this difference is by no means greater than that which may be observed on comparing the individuals of which any single race or nation is composed. On the other hand, a constant and decided difference exists, as already pointed out, be- tween all races of mankind and the highest Quadrumana. Again, it has been supposed that the Negro races are characterised by that peculiar curved form of the bones of the leg, which gives rise to what is popularly desig- nated as the "cucumber-shin;" also by the great elongation of the heel; and by the breadth and flatness of the foot. Such pecu- liarities are doubtless to be observed among individuals, and may be said to be general among the inferior Negro tribes ; but they are scarcely discoverable in the higher, among which a remarkable degree of symmetry in the conformation of these parts is often dis- cernible. And it should not be forgotten that the increased development of the heel, and the flattening of the foot, are characters which remove the Negro from the anthropoid apes, still more widely than the European, instead of being a character of approximation. It has been further asserted, that the inferior races generally are characterised by slender, elongated, and mis-shapen limbs, and by a great deficiency of physical power, as compared with Europeans. This is undoubtedly true of such as are habitually ill-fed, and live in a condition of squalid ignorance. But it is scarcely less true of those individuals among any of the higher races, who are subjected to the same conditions. Thus, although the extreme of this condition is witnessed among the Bosjesmans and Alfourous, yet approaches to it may be seen among the lowest grades of the population in the most civilised nations. The accompanying figure (Jig, 827), which represents a group of Australians looking at a Fig. 827. mirror that had been presented to one of their tribe, who had been clothed by the sailors of the Astrolabe, might almost be supposed to be intended for a set of half-starved Irish. More- over, among the races which are considered to exhibit this character in its most decided form, individuals are often found, who, having grown up under more favourable conditions, exhibit the most complete symmetry, and the greatest vigour. Such, for example, are not wanting among the Australian races, which present a remarkable variety in this particular. Among most savage races, the families of the chiefs exhibit a higher grade of physical de- velopment than the ordinary population ; and this is quite sufficiently accounted for by theVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1333 difference of the conditions under which they live, especially in regard to food. It may he safely asserted, then, that on none of the foregoing characters can specific distinctions be justly based, since none of them possess the constancy which is required to give them such a rank; and those which are most strongly marked in particular cases, are such as can be proved to he most liable to modification from external conditions. 4. We next have to inquire into the dis- tinctions founded upon the Colour of the Shin ; which, at first sight, appear to present a degree of constancy that gives them a strong claim to be regarded as permanent, and there- fore as valid distinctive characters between the several races of mankind. The hue of the Skin, it is now well known, exists in the epidermis only, and depends upon the pre- sence of pigmentary matter in the ordinary cells of that part. What was formerly known as the " rete mucosum," or " rete Malpighii," and described as a distinct colouring layer between the epidermis and cutis vera, is now known to be nothing else than the newest and softest layer of epidermis. There is no structure (as has been affirmed by some ana- tomists) in the skin of the dark races, that is at all peculiar to it ; the very same dark matter being found in particular spots of the fairest skins, as in that of the areola sur- rounding the nipple during pregnancy. The following is the description of the structure given by Messrs. Todd and Bowman, the accuracy of which the author can fully confirm from his own observation :—" However vari- ous in colour and hue, the colouring matter always consists of oblong or oval grains of extreme minuteness (l-20,000th of an inch in their long diameter), and occupying the interior of some of the epidermic particles. In the Negro it is accumulated in enormous quantity, and completely envelopes the nu- clei immediately resting on the cutis. On examining a vertical section of the whole cuticle, we find the colouring matter gradually diminishing as we approach the surface ; and it is most clear that there is no true line of demarcation between the two portions. We may observe the colour of the rete muco- sum deeper at points; and a greater propor- tionate depth of colour is traceable over such points, through all the layers, as far as the sur- face ; we may even discern a sort of stream of coloured grains advancing towards the surface. Hence there can be little doubt that the de- crease of colour in the superficial laminae is due to that chemical change which has been described as gradually taking place in the interior of the epidermic particles."* Still it might be affirmed that the presence of a large amount of pigmentary matter, of a * Physiological Anatomy, vol. i. p. 415.—The Rete Malpighii is represented by Prof. Kolliker as more distinct from the superjacent layers; but the writer has not been able, to satisfy himself of the accuracy of the descriptions and figures of Prof. Kolliker on this point. See his Microskopische Ana- tomie; Zweiter Hand. §§ 14—22. peculiar tint, in the substance of the epider- mis, constitutes a typical character of par- ticular races, even though there be no distinct pigmentary layer ; since spots and patches of colour are often admitted as specific distinc- tions among the lower animals. Thus, for example, it has been maintained that the fair and ruddy Saxon, the jet-black Negro, the olive Mongolian, and the copper-coloured North-American, have as good a claim to be ranked as distinct species, on the score of the uniform transmission of their respective hues from generation to generation, as have many races of Lepidoptera (for example) which are regarded by naturalists as specifi- cally diverse on account of the distribution of colour in the scales of their wings. But as the validity of the specific distinction among these last entirely rests upon the intransitive nature of the character, the several individuals that constitute either race exhibiting no ap- proximation towards those of the other, and the successive generations repeating the re- spective peculiarities of each race with great exactness, we must apply the same test to the Human races. Now, if we take anyone of those groups of nations which are usually regarded as alto- gether constituting a race, such as the (so- called) Caucasian, the Mongolian, the African the American, or the Polynesian, it will be found that the greatest diversity of com- plexion exists within its limits. Thus, among the " Jnpetic" races, — which are cha- racterised by the possession of the oval type of cranial conformation, and whose languages are so clearly traceable to a common stock, that no philologist now questions the identity of their origin,—we find every range of colour, from the fair Saxon and Celtic nations, to the deep brown of the Indian Brahmin.* Among the Syro-Arabian, or " Semitic" races, again, which are spread over South-western Asia and Northern Africa, and which are connected by close affinity of language, there is an equal variety of complexion. All travellers who have visited the high lands of Arabia, repre- sent the inhabitants as having light com- plexions, their eyes being often blue, and their hair red. The Arabs near Muscat are of a sickly yellow hue ; those of the neigh- bourhood of Mecca are of a yellowish brown, while those of the low countries bordering on the Nile are almost jet-black. So, again, among the various tribes referable to the same stock, which inhabit the Atlantic region of the north of Africa, similar differences of com- plexion prevail; for whilst those which inhabit the higher lands and mountain passes, such as the tribe of Mozabi among the Kabyles, are remarkably fair, those which dwell in the more level parts of the country are swarthy, * The hue of many of the races of Lower India is as black as that of any Negroes ; but there is a doubt (as will hereafter appear) as to their origin. If not Indo-Atlantic, however, they are Mongolian ; and the peculiarity is at least as striking, when they are viewed as off-sets from the latter stock, as when they are considered as appertaining to the former.1334 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. and some of the Tuaryks which inhabit the borders of the Great Desert, are as black as the darkest Negro. Among the proper African nations, it may be supposed that no such variety would embarrass us; blackness, with a reddish or yellowish tinge, being accounted the uni- versal hue of the Ethiopian race. But this notion is chiefly founded upon the com- plexion which prevails in a very small part of the great African continent ; and no fact is really better established, than that of the great diversity of complexion which pre- vails among its different inhabitants. Thus, among some of the Kaffir tribes,—which often possess high foreheads and prominent noses,— light brown complexions, and reddish hair are often met with ; yet there is every reason for the belief that they are of the same stock with the Negroes of the Guinea coast, and intermediate gradations in complexion are presented by the nations which occupy an intermediate geographical position. There are tribes even upon the gold and slave coasts, which are considerably lighter than ordinary Negroes. Moreover, the Hottentot has a large admixture of yellow in his com- plexion, whilst the Fiilahs of Central Africa are of a dark copper colour. The African tribes which border on the Red Sea,and which seem to constitute the link of transition be- tween the Ethiopian and the Semitic races, present every grade of colour, from the deep black of the Negro to the swarthiness of the lighter Arabs, notwithstanding that there is no reason to believe these characters to have been acquired by the intermixture either of an Ethiopian stock with Arabs, or of an Arab stock with Ethiopians. There is strong ground for the opinion, as we shall see here- after, that the ancient Egyptians, whose com- plexion (as represented by their own artists) seems to have been of a red copper or light chocolate colour, were so closely allied to the proper African nations, that the origin of both must have been the same.—The complexion of the African nations, then, wants that cha- racter of uniformity, which is required to distinguish it from that of other branches of the human family ; and a marked tendency to assimilation is exhibited in the hues of the African and of the Semitic races inhabiting similar localities, a fact whose full significance will appear hereafter. On instituting a similar comparison be- tween the complexions of the various branches and off-sets of the mongolian race, it will appear that, although an admixture of yellow is one of its most constant cha- racters, yet this may co-exist with other shades, and may even disappear altogether. Thus, in the remains of the aboriginal tribes of India still existing in the hilly regions of the north, in the Dekhan, and especially in Ceylon, all of which appear, from the charac- ters of their language, their peculiar customs, and their traditions, to be descendants of the Mongolian rather than of the Japetic stock, we find a variety of shades of complexion, and this within the limits of the same people. For example, the Cinghalese are described by Dr. Davy as varying in colour from light brown to black; the prevalent hue of their hair and eyes is black, but hazel eyes and brown hair are not very uncommon; grey eyes and red hair are occasionally, though rarely, seen, and sometimes the light blue or red eye, and light flaxen hair of the Albino. Dr. Davy, in describing such a one, remarks that her complexion would scarcely be con- sidered peculiar in England, certainly not in Norway ; for her eyes were light blue, and not particularly weak, her hair of the colour that usually accompanies such eyes, and her com- plexion rather rosy. This tendency towards a fair and even florid complexion, with light eyes and bushy hair, can be traced in several other nations of the same type, such as the Mantchoos in China, and also among the Chinese themselves. On the other hand, the hardy Samoiedes, Tungusians, Kamschatdales, and others, living on the borders of the Icy Sea, have a dirty brown or swarthy com- plexion. If we pass on to the Oceanic races, we find that any attempts to employ com- plexion as a means of distinguishing them from other primary stocks, must utterly fail, so great and numerous are the diversities. In almost every group of islands in the great Oceanic area, the natives differ in complexion from those of other groups ; thus the Malays of the Eastern Archipelago, who resemble the Chinese in features and general conforma- tion, are of a darker colour, retaining, how- ever, a yellow tinge in their complexion ; this tinge comes out very strongly in the natives of the Caroline Islands, whose aspect is de- cidedly Mongolian, and whose complexion is of a citron hue, becoming brown by exposure; the Tahitians and Marquesans, especially in the families of their chiefs, which are secluded from the wind and the sun, exhibit a clear olive or brunette complexion, such as is common among the nations of Southern Europe ; the Hawaii, or Sandwich Islanders, are somewhat darker ; while of the new Zea- landers and Ombai Islanders, some are com- paratively fair, while others are dark or almost black. Besides these, however, Australia, New Guinea, and some of the neighbouring islands are more or less exclusively peopled by tribes bearing a close resemblance in com- plexion and aspect to Negroes, whose precise relation to the Malayo-Polynesian races it is difficult to determine. There is, however, such a complete transition from one type to the other, presented by the natives of different localities among whom there is no reason to suppose that any intermixture has taken place, and the differences are such between the higher and lower castes of even the same tribe, that all intelligent persons who have long resided among the islands of the Pacific, under circumstances favourable to accurate investigation, appear to have come to the conclusion,—that none of those characters on which some observers have relied, as being1335 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. strongly marked in the individuals whom they have happened to see in the course of their brief visits to different localities, can be relied on as general expressions of the attributes of particular races. So that if colour be once adopted as a test of separate origin, we must suppose that tribes speaking the same lan- guage, having the same customs and tradi- tions, and closely allied in general conforma- tion, sprang nevertheless from ancestors who had no relation to one another ; and a distinct pair must be assigned to almost every island or group of islands, and, in some instances, even two or more pairs to a single island. Lastly, in regard to the American nations, it is sufficient to remark, that the appel- lation " red men," is by no means charac- teristic of them as a whole ; for not only are tribes elsewhere found at least equally deserving of it, but it is not applicable to a large proportion of the population of the New Continent. For although some of the North-American Indians are copper-coloured, some are as fair as many Europeans; others are of a brown or yellow complexion; and others nearly, if not quite, as black as African Negroes. Similar diversities exist among the aborigines of South America. Here, also, therefore, we should be forced into the sup- position of a large number of primitive stocks in near vicinity to each other, were so much authority to be attributed to colour, as to allow it to rank as a sufficiently distinctive character for the specific discrimination of any of the races of mankind. We have now to examine if the peculiari- ties of colour seen among different races can be attributed with any considerable degree of probability to external agencies; and the evi- dence bearing on this question may be con- sidered under two heads, namely (1.) the constancy of the relation between the habitual operation of particular climatic influences and particular shades of complexion ; and (2.) the historical evidence of an actual change of complexion, in races or tribes that are known to have migrated from one locality to an- other of a different character, or to have changed their mode of life. Now, the general relation between climate and complexion is apparent on the most cur- sory survey of the facts. It is only in the intertropical regions, and in the countries bordering on them, that we meet with the greatest depth of colour in the skin ; and all the nations inhabiting the level parts of those regions exhibit a tendency towards a very dark hue. On the other hand, the colder temperate regions are the residence of the fair races. And the intermediate coun- tries exhibit the transition from one com- plexion to the other, as we see on passing from Central Africa, through Northern Africa and Southern Europe, to Northern Eu- rope. Now this, if we had no evidence to the contrary, might fairly be held to indicate that each race had been created with especial reference to a particular cli- mate ; the principal difficulty in the way of such a supposition, being the great number of different races whose separate origins it would be necessary to assume, if it be held that each has uniformly exhibited the complexion which it now possesses. But it is most re- markable that elevation above the sea-level is found to have the same uniform relation to the human complexion, that it has to vege- tation. For as we find the plants of temperate or even arctic regions on the sides of inter- tropical mountains, so do we notice that high mountains and table-lands of great elevation are almost uniformly inhabited by people of lighter hue than those of the surrounding country, however close may be their affinity ; whilst low and level countries, especially those which border on the sea, are as com- monly tenanted by people of an unusually dark colour. Thus the deepest hue among the African races is to be found among the negroes of the swampy plains of the Guinea coast; yet there are several instances, in which nations residing at no great distance from these, but at a higher level, are compa- ratively light, although their ancestry is un- doubtedly the same. In Northern India, again, the lightness of complexion among the inhabitants of the mountains and table-lands is almost exactly in accordance with the elevation at which the tribe has been accus- tomed to dwell ; and some of these present complexions of almost European fairness. On the other hand, among the tribes that wander along the shores of the Icy Sea, their proximity to the ocean, together with their habitual exposure, seem to compensate in some degree for their distance from the equator; so that their hue is much swarthier than that of the more civilised inhabitants of Northern Europe. The influence of seclu- sion from exposure, in lightening the hue of the skin among the higher castes of various tropical races, has been already remarked upon ; and another indication of the import- ance of this influence is derived from the concurrent though independent observations of M. D'Orbigny and Sir R. Schomburgh upon the people of the New World, both having remarked that those tribes which live under the damp shade of dense and lofty forests, are much fairer than those which are freely exposed to solar light and heat in dry and open spaces. The influence of continued exposure to the solar rays is often strongly marked in individuals of the lighter races ; those who are naturally of a " brunette" complexion becoming swarthy, whilst in those who are naturally fair or " blonde," there is a tendency either to a general reddening or " tanning" of the skin, or to the development of " freckles," which are nothing else than local collections of pigmentary matter, usually of a reddish-yellow colour. In such cases, the parts of the body which are habitually kept covered retain their original fairness. Seeing, then, that continued exposure to the solar rays has such a marked effect upon the complexion of individuals who are sub- jected to it, we should be led to expect, upon 4 q i1336 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. the principles already laid down, that this effect would be increased when the cause is in continued operation for several genera- tions. And we might with the more confi- dence anticipate such a result, when we see that a marked difference in complexion often exists between parent and offspring, or be- tween the children of the same parents. Thus, it is a matter of familiar observation, that of two members of the same family, the one shall be a blonde, the other a brunette. Further, it is not uncommon to find, in indi- viduals of the fair races, large patches of the surface almost as deeply coloured as the skin of the negro. On the other hand, albinoism, that is, the total absence of colouring matter in the skin, is probably as common among dark races as among fair. And Dr. Prichard has collected evidence which shows that in many of the individuals who have been de- signated as " white Negroes," there has not been mere albinoism (that is, an entire ab- sence of colouring matter), but a positive de- velopment of the colouring matter that cha- racterises the xanthous variety, in which the complexion is fair and ruddy. Such being the tendency to variation presented by this character, we might fairly anticipate that it might undergo marked changes in the course of a long succession of generations, especially where the external conditions have been altered ; and there is no deficiency of valid historical evidence, that proves this to have been the case.—Perhaps the most striking example that could be cited, is that afforded by the Jewish race; in which there is no ques- tion that a general purity of descent has been preserved through a long succession of gene- tions, during which the scattered residence of the race has subjected it to a great variety of climatic influences. Now, although the de- scendants of Abraham are still generally re- cognizable by certain peculiarities of physiog- nomy (so that they have often been quoted as examples of the permanence and fixity of the characters of races), yet a great variety of complexion exists among them. Thus, among the Jews whose families have been long settled in this country, although a light brunette hue with black hair is most common, yet a fair complexion, with blue eyes, is not unfre- quent. In Germany and Poland, the ordi- nary complexion is more florid, and blue eyes are more common. On the other hand, the Jews of Portugal are almost invariably much darker than those of Northern and Central Europe, as are also those who still cling to their ancient home in Palestine. Lastly, the Jews that have been settled in India for a long succession of generations, have become nearly as black as the natives around them, so that the people of a particular colony at Mattacheri, in Cochin, in whom this change has not yet taken place, are distinguished >y the appellation of" white Jews." Hence it may be stated as a general proposition, that the complexion of the Jewish race tends to as- similate itself to that prevailing in any country in which their residence has been sufficiently prolonged ; and even admitting that a limited admixture with the surrounding population has taken place in any or all of these in- stances, still the introduction of a small quan- tity of extraneous blood does not by any means afford an adequate explanation of the change, since it has not been sufficient to alter any of the other characters of the race, and (as already remarked) the immediate results of such an occasional admixture are soon merged in the general uniformity of the mass. It is probable that, in races as in individuals, the influence of a tropical climate in darkening the complexion will be more decided, in pro- portion to the previous condition of the chro- matogenous function ; for example, that the Jews, whose natural complexion is swarthy, are more readily blackened than Saxons or Celts would be, the pigmentary matter in their epidermis being of a different character. There are several other cases of the same kind, in which the historical testimony is less complete, but in which the deficiency is made up by philological evidence. Thus, the Ba- rabra or Berberines of the higher parts of the Nile, appear, from the most careful researches that have been made into their history, to be the descendants of the Nobatae, who were brought by Diocletian from an oasis in the western country, fifteen centuries ago, to in- habit the valley of the Nile. The particular district out of which they issued was proba- bly Kordofan, the inhabitants of which, true Negroes, still preserve and speak the Barabra language. In their habits of life, they show a considerable advance in civilisation ; and this has been accompanied by a considerable change in complexion, their present physiog- nomy and hue of skin presenting a marked resemblance to that of the ancient Egyptians. This alteration cannot be set down to any intermixture with the Arabs, or other in- habitants of the Nile Valley, from whom the Berberines keep themselves distinct.—In like manner, the Funge, who made themselves masters of Sennaar about three centuries ago, although originally Negroes of the Shilukh nation, no longer present the physiognomy or complexion of that race, but much more nearly approach the Berberines. There ap- pears, in both cases, to be a special tendency towards a red complexion, and even red hair ; and among the Funge, the individuals thus distinguished are stated to form a separate caste, being known under the name of " El Akmar," or "the red people." In Northern India, again, there is no doubt that many of the tribes of mountaineers, already alluded to as distinguished by fair complexion and blue eyes, are of the same stock with the inhabit- ants of the low country ; their language, tra- ditions, religious observances, &c, being es- sentially the same. One of the most remark- able of these tribes is the Siah-Posh, a people of exquisite beauty, with regular Grecian features, blue eyes, arched eyebrows, and a fair complexion, having no resemblance to the Affghan or Cashmerian people, near whom they dwell; their language principallyVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1337 consists of Sanscrit words, although Sanscrit is no longer the spoken language of any part of India ; and they are acquainted with only the simplest form of Hindoo mythology ; whence it may be fairly concluded, that they separated from the common stock at a very early period. Thus, then, we have very strong evidence that a certain relation exists between climate and colour; and it is no valid objection to the existence of such a relation, to say that it is not perfectly uniform. For it is at least as uniform as the relation between colour and race, even where the climatic influences are the same ; that is, the difference of shade among people of different races that have been exposed sufficiently long to the same climatic influences, is not greater than that which presents itself among individuals of the very same nation. It would seem that, among the most dark-skinned races, there is a greater variety of complexion than is found in those of fairer hue. Such has been already shown to be the case among the Polynesian islanders; and the following extract from Bishop He- ber's Journal will serve to indicate the amount of variety existing among the Hindoos. " On first landing," he remarks, " the great differ- ence in colour between different natives struck me much. Of the crowd by whom we were surrounded, some were as black as Negroes, others merely copper-coloured, and others little darker than the Tunisines whom I have seen in Liverpool. Mr. Mill, the principal of the British College, who came down to meet me, and who has seen more of India than most men, tells me that he cannot account for this difference, which is general throughout the country, and every where striking. It is not merely the difference of exposure, since this variety is visible in the fishermen, who are naked all alike. Nor does it depend on caste, since very high-caste Brahmins are sometimes black, while Pariahs are comparatively fair. It seems, therefore, to be an accidental difference, like that ot light and dark complexions in Europe ; though, where so much of the body is exposed to light, it becomes more striking here than in our own country." So among the in- habitants of Central Europe, it appears that a considerable modification in complexion has oc- curred, which is not sufficiently accounted for by the climatic change that has taken place in it since the classical epoch. For the Ger- manic nations were unanimously described by ancient authors as exceedingly fair, possessing yellow or red hair, and blue or grey eyes; but these characters are now far from being pre- valent among them, and it is only amongst the Scandinavian races that they are common to the mass of the people. On the whole, then, it must be concluded that the Colour of the Skin is a character of such variable nature, that no positive line of demarcation can be drawn by its aid between the different races of mankind ; and whilst it must be freely admitted that we are far from comprehending all the influences which ope- rate to modify it, there seems ample evidence that climatic variations, whose agency is ex- erted for a sufficiently long period, are among the most efficient. This statement is ob- viously not invalidated by the fact, that Ne- groes and other dark-skinned people, who have lived for some time in temperate cli- mates, have not lost their characteristic hue. For there is no example on record, so far as the author is aware, in which a Negro tribe or set of families has maintained itself for even three or four generations in a temperate climate, without intermixture either with the surrounding " whites " or with " blacks " of more immediate tropical descent. And until it shall have been shown that a continuous descent of many generations has taken place, in a group of Negroes completely isolated from the parent stock, and exposed to the condi- tions which are presumed to favour the pro- duction of the xanthous variety, without any considerable departure from their present com- plexion, there will be no negative evidence at all equivalent in probative value to the facts already cited on the affirmative side of the question. 5. We have now to inquire into the cha- racters furnished by the colour, texture, and mode of growth of the Hair, which have been much relied on by some writers, as more per- manent and distinctive than those furnished by the hue of the skin. Thus, the Negro is usually characterised by his " woolly " hair ; while the Mongolian races are affirmed to be peculiar in the scantiness of their pilous covering ; and the Hottentots are further separated by its tufted arrangement, which has been compared to the mode in which the bristles are set in a scrubbing-brush.—Now in regard to the colour of the hair, it is scarcely necessary to remark that it cannot be taken alone as a distinctive character of races ; since it is liable to present the most extreme variations within the limits of any one. Among the xanthous Anglo-Saxons, for example, jet-black hair is by no means uncommon ; although various shades of brown are most frequently met with. Among Ne- groes, on the other hand, it is not at all rare to meet with a more or less complete de- parture from what may be freely admitted to be the prevalent character of their race. In the instances which have been already cited as proving the want of constancy in the com- plexion of the dark or melanic races, a corre- sponding change manifests itself in the colour of the hair, which often becomes of a reddish brown, or even of a much lighter hue. These may occur in individuals, or in whole tribes. Thus, Dr. Pickering speaks of having seen two children, in whom "the Negro aspect had so entirely disappeared, that they might have passed for the children of Europeans, but for the remarkable appearance of the hair," which he could " compare to nothing but a white fleece." * The Cinghalese, according to the testimony of Dr. Davy, present as many va- * The Races of Man (Bomi's edition), p. 188VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1338 rieties of hair as they do of complexion ; its hue ranging through black and brown to red and even flaxen : and precisely the same is true of the Tahitians and Marquesans among the Oceanic race, as well as among many other nations. The texture and mode of growth of the hair, however, are characters on which it would appear, at first sight, that more re- liance may be placed. The pilous covering may be described as " woolly," " crisped" or "friz- zled," "flowing " or "wavy," and "straight." The African and Oceanic Negroes alone are characterised by " woolly" hair ; the Austra- lians, Abyssinians, and many African nations, usually have the hair more or less " crisped" or " frizzled;" among the Indo-Europeans, the " flowing" or " wavy" character prevails ; while a peculiar straightness most commonly presents itself among nations of Mongolian descent. It is obvious, however, that these several terms express little more than differ- ences in degree. For if " straight" hair has a slight tendency to curl, it becomes " wavy;" if this tendency be increased, it is commonly termed " curly ; " the " crisped " or " friz- zled " hair is little else than hair with a pecu- liarly stiff" and close curl ; and the " woolly " covering of the head of the Negro is by no means so different from the crisped hair of other dark races, as the designation given to it would imply, the chief difference consisting in its closeness of texture and its tendency to mat together. As Dr. Prichard has correctly stated, it is clearly shown by microscopic ob- servation that the hair of the Negro is not really " wool," and it presents no constant structural difference from the jet-black hair which is not uncommon among Europeans. It has lately been asserted, however, by Dr.P. A.Browne, of Philadelphia, that the following definite structural differences do exist: —" The hair of the white man presents an oval section ; that of the Choctaw and some other American Indians is cylindrical ; that of the Negro is eccentrically elliptical or flat. The hair of the white man, besides its cortex and intermediate fibres, has a central canal, which contains the colouring matter, when present. The wool of the Negro has no central canal, and the colouring matter is diffused, when present, either throughout the cortex, or this and the intermediate fibres. In hair the enveloping scales are comparatively few, smooth of surface, rounded at their points, and closely embrace the shaft; in wool they are numerous, rough, sharp-pointed, and project from the shaft. Hence the hair of the white man wiil not felt ; the wool of the Negro will."* Now, upon this it may be remarked that neither of the characters speci- fied by Dr. Browne will stand the test of extensive observation. The form of the shaft, as shown in transverse section, varies greatly in the hairs of the same race, and even in those of the same individual ; for not only is it sometimes round, sometimes oval, and (though more rarely) eccentrically elliptic or * Transactions of the American Medical Associa- tion, vol. iii. p. G2. nearly flat; but it may be even reniform, or channelled on one side, a variety of which Dr. Browne takes no notice, except as oc- curring in the Hottentot. The central canal of the hair, which is occupied by medullary cells, is an extremely variable character; being often undistinguishable in the hair of the white races. Moreover, the pigmentary matter is sometimes almost exclusively con- fined to the cells of the central canal ; some- times it is equally diffused through the whole fibrous substance forming the shaft of the hair: and sometimes we have even seen it in greatest abundance towards the periphery, the centre being pale. Hence the elliptical section, the absence of " central canal," and the diffusion of pigmentary matter through the hair, are not in the least degree peculiar to the Negro, and cannot be regarded as characteristic of his hair. So, again, the writer takes upon himself to assert that there is not a greater difference in the degree of serration on the surface (which is due to the imbricated arrangement of the scales forming the cortical layer) between the hair of the Negro and that of other races, than exists among the individuals of any one race ; and that the Negro's hair does not approximate more closely to wool in this respect, than the Negro's cranium does to that of the chim- panzee. The only constant peculiarity of the Negro's hair is the tendency to a close curl; and this seems connected with its form. As a general rule it may be stated that the roundest hairs curl least, and that those which show most flattening are the most disposed to curvature in their growth. But that there is something also in the nutrition of the hair which influences its mode of growth, appears from the following fact stated by Mr. Erasmus Wilson as the result of extensive observa- tions : — "I have collected several instances in which the hair, naturally possessing a strong curl, becomes lank and straight if its pos- sessor be out of health ; the straightness of the hair becoming as certain an index of a disordered state of the economy, as a yellow eye-ball or a white tongue."* Now if we attempt to apply the texture of the hair to the discrimination of races, we find that although it has a certain value as affording a character of general applicability, yet that this will not bear being carried too minutely into particulars. Thus, among the African nations, there are many whose affinity to the Negro race cannot be questioned, and which yet have merely " crisped " or " friz- zled" hair, instead of a woolly covering ; and there are others which cannot be shown on any other grounds to have a different descent, among whom the hair is long and flowing. On the other hand, we not unfrequently meet with individuals among the Anglo- Saxon race, in whom the hair is not merely curly, but " frizzled," and almost " woolly" in its texture. Among the Oceanic races, again, there is every gradation of the same kind ; * On the Management of the Skin, 3d ed. p. 77.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1339 find great varieties present themselves within the limits of any one tribe. Here, too, the influence of external conditions shows itself in a very marked degree ; for it is among the inhabitants of the lower levels bordering on the sea, between the tropics, who are most exposed to the vertical rays of the sun, their climatic conditions being nearly allied to those of the Negro, that the "woolly" character most remarkably shows itself; whilst in other tribes of the same race, which are not less prognathous, but live in higher and drier situa- tions, the hair is only " frizzled," or even becomes long and wavy. Even if, as Dr. Prichard justly remarks, the hair of the Negro were really analogous to wool, it would by no means prove the Negro to be a peculiar and separate stock, unless the peculiarity were constantly presented by all the nations of similar descent ; and were restricted to them alone ; for, as already pointed out, there are breeds of domesticated animals which bear wool, whilst others of the same species, under different climatic influences, are covered with long straight hair. It is not unimportant to notice, that wool is occasionally borne by the dog, ox, and hog, to neither of which it is natural ; whilst the sheep, whose ordinary covering is composed of it, occasionally ex- change it for long straight hair. These facts so unequivocally prove that the texture of the hair is peculiarly liable to be influenced by external conditions, that it could only be on the strictest proof of invariability, that such a character could be properly adopted as a basis for specific distinction. As examples in which there is historical evidence of alteration in the texture and mode of growth of the hair, it will be sufficient to refer to the case of the Barabras already cited, whose hair, originally woolly, has be- come longer and straighter, only retaining a slight crispness ; and to that of the Western Turks, w hose chins are furnished with flow ing beards, in which their Eastern relatives are almost entirely deficient. The greatest peculiarity in the growth of the hair is exhibited by the Hottentot race. The following account of its appearance in a young Bushman, who recently died in the United States, is given by Dr. Parsons* : — " His hair lay in little distinct, compact, curly tufts, twisted spirally ; and in the intervals of these tufts, the skin was distinctly seen. The filaments were very fine, some of them five inches long, and black. They contained a distinct cortex and granular medulla. The transverse section of a filament resembled that of the Negro's, except in being concave on one of the two longer sides of the ellipse," or reni- form. Thus, in the texture of the hair itself, the Hottentot seems allied to the Negro, whilst its sparseness reminds us of the scanti- ness by which the Mongolian races are gene- rally characterised. We shall hereafter see, that there is strong reason for regarding the Hottentot race as of kin to the Negro ; and * Transactions of the American Medical Associa- tion, vol. iii. p C2. for attributing the modification which it has undergone to the external conditions of its existence. The peculiar character of the chevelure of the Papuans, which will be no- ticed in the account of that race, seems to be chiefly due to its artificial treatment. From the Anatomical portion of our inquiry, then, we are led to the general conclusion, first, that no such difference exists in the ex- ternal conformation or internal structure of the different Races of Men, as would justify the assertion of their distinct origin ; and, secondly, that although the comparison of the structural characters of races does not furnish any positive evidence of their descent from a common stock, it proves that even if their stocks tverc originally distinct, there could have been no essential difference between them, the descendants of any one such stock being able to assume the characters of an- other. Of the next subject for investigation, the Pliysiolvgical conformity or diversity of the several races of mankind, a much briefer sum- mary will be sufficient. This part of the in- quiry has been pursued with great diligence and success by Dr. Prichard*, who lays it down as a general axiom (the truth of which must be admitted by all who are competent to form an opinion on the subject, its validity being confirmed by the careful study of those races of domesticated animals w hich are re- markable for the greatest amount of anatomi- cal variation), that the great laws of the vital functions, such as those expressing the periods and duration of life, the economy of the sexes, and the phenomena of parturition and repro- duction, are, with slight deviations resulting from external agencies, constant and uniform in each particular species; whilst there are usually decided differences in regard to the same peculiarities among races of animals, which, though nearly resembling each other, are yet specifically distinct. Now, taking the average duration of life as the first point of comparison, it has been shown by Dr. Prichard, that, whilst there is a marked difference in this respect between man and the highest apes — the full term of exist- ence of the chimpanzee being stated by M. Lesson at not more than thirty years, and that of inferior species being less,— there is absolutely no difference among the several races of mankind, the extreme age of the Negro and American races being at least as great as that of the European, with the same average duration of life under the same cir- cumstances as regards climate, mode of life, &c. The age at which the body attains its full development, also, appears to be the same amongst different races ; or, at any rate, does not differ more than among the different indi- viduals of the same race. The inquiry into the epoch of the first menstruation has been most industriously prosecuted by Mr. Ro- * Physical History of Mankind, vol. i.1340 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. berton ; and its results, published from time to time, as they were obtained, have been lately collected in a form which admits of easy comparison.* It appears, from the evidence which he has brought together, that there is no considerable difference either in the average period of puberty, or in the earliest date of menstruation, among the greater number of tribes who are scattered over the whole of the habitable globe, from the equatorial to the polar regions , and that neither has a cold climate that influence in retarding it, nor a warm one in accelerating it, which is popu- larly attributed to these agencies respectively. The only well-marked exception to this general rule, occurs in the case of the Hindoo females, among whom the first menstruation occurs on the average about two years earlier than in this country. But this only arises from the fact, that a larger proportion of first menstru- ations among Hindoo females, takes place in the earlier years of that period, over which the commencement of puberty is distributed in European females, the distribution in the latter being more equable, as will be seen by the following table, furnished by Mr. Rober- ton: — Ages. Hindustan. England. 8 3 9 8 14 10 18 55 11 80 77 12 145 142 13 139 263 14 105 396 15 45 417 16 24 340 17 18 215 18 5 138 19 3 65 20 1 33 21 2 9 22 4 23 1 1 597 2169 For whilst the average age of puberty in the Hindoo female is thirteen years, and in the British, fourteen years eleven months, the per-centage of menstruations under eleven years is nearly the same in the two countries, so that the current idea of the very early pu- berty of Hindoo females is quite incorrect ; and the difference in the average solely arises from the fact, that the greatest number of first menstruations occur among Hindoo females in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth years, whilst among the females of this country the larger proportion presents itself in the four- teenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth years. Now this difference, as Mr. Roberton justly re- marks, cannot be attributed to climate, for Demerara and the West Indian Islands have a higher mean annual temperature than Cal- * Essays and Notes on the Physiology and Dis- eases of Women, and on Practical Midwifery. 8vo. London, 1851. cutta and the Dekhan; and yet we know that the Negresses in these colonies are not earlier than the peasant women in England. A more probable cause, however, lies in the peculiar habits of the natives of that country, which tend, in more ways than one, to force forward the period of puberty. " It is the law of the Shastras, that females shall be given in mar- riage before the occurrence of menstruation, and that, should consummation not take place until after this event, the marriage is a sin. Accordingly, it is the custom in Lower Ben- gal to send the girl at the age of nine years to the house of her husband, unless the latter be so distant that it cannot be done ; and two ancient Hindoo sages are of opinion, that if the marriage is not consummated before the first appearance of the catamenia, the girl becomes 'degraded in rank.' At Bangalore it would seem that this revolting custom does not obtain, the husband refraining from taking his wife to his own house till not less than sixteen days have elapsed subsequently to puberty."* Now, it can scarcely be ques- tioned that such a premature sexual excite- ment will have a tendency to accelerate the epoch of puberty; and that, when this is con- stantly acting through a long succession of generations, an early puberty may come to be a character of race. But besides this modus operandi of the custom in question, the fol- lowing has been pointed out by Mr. Ro- berton :—"When it is recollected that the consummation of marriage among the Hindoos has taken place, at the latest, on the arrival of puberty, during a lapse of more than three thousand years, and that the practice is sanc- tioned by ancient laws and consecrated by custom, it is easy to conceive that those females who were latest in reaching puberty, would be the least sought after for wives,—that such women would not be unlikely, in many in- stances, to remain unmarried,—and that thus (owing to the origination of a preference on this ground in the selection of their wives, operating through a long period of time) Hindoo women would gradually come to con- sist, in a proportion different from that in Europe or elsewhere, of such as by constitu- tion are early nubile. To me there seems no- thing extravagant or far-fetched in this sup- position. The production of a like state of things in England, in any particular district, is quite conceivable. Nothing is better esta- blished, than that early (or late) puberty is a family peculiarity. Let us, then, only sup- pose families, possessing this kind of consti- tution, to intermarry, and the peculiarity in question would be propagated, extended, and transmitted ; and so a race, distinguished by it, would be produced."-|- It is a justification of this view, that the mean age of puberty should differ in Bengal and the Dekhan, to the extent of nearly a year, being twelve years six months in the former province, and thirteen years five months in the latter, notwithstand- ing its warmer latitude ; for, as just stated, * Op. cit. p. 131. f Op. cit. p. 129.1341 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. although formal marriages take place at a very early age throughout India, the custom is so far modified in the Dekhan, that consummation is not effected until after the first menstruation has appeared. The frequency of the catamcnial flux, and the epoch of life to which it extendi!, appear from Mr. Roberton's inquiries, to be no less constant among different races. It is quite true that the period of child-bearing is sooner terminated among the women of many tribes, especially in tropical climates, than it usually is in this country ; but this is fairly attri- butable to the earlier marriages, and the con- sequently premature excitement of the gene- rative power, of which its earlier decline is the natural consequence. The same is continually seen in this country. The marked difference in this respect, that arises out of laws and customs affecting the marriage state, is shown by the fact, that in India the mean age for a first parturition is I5£ years, whilst among 500 Manchester female operatives, tabulated by Mr. Roberton, the mean age was found to be 23 years. Some very curious evidence has been collected by that gentleman, which goes to prove that marriages nearly as pre- mature as those of Hindoo females were for- merly sanctioned by law and public opinion in this country; and that in Ireland they have been by no means unfrequent within a recent period. The duration of pregnane!/ is well known to be the same throughout all the races of man- kind ; and this is a fact of peculiar importance, as a difference in this respect is elsewhere observable between species that are in other respects closely allied. The fertility of hybrid races, originating in the intermixture of two races whose affinity is most remote, is a fact of which there can be no doubt whatever ; and there is strong reason to believe that those hybrid races, the parents of which are Europeans on one side, and the aborigines of any country on the other, are generally destined to become the dominant population of those countries. For, on the one hand, these " half-castes" very commonly combine the best attributes of the two races from whose admixture they sprang ; namely, the intelligence and mental activity of the European, and the climatic adaptation of the native.* And they are also in general distinguished for their fertility, when paired with each other, so that they are rapidly rising into numerical importance. On the other hand, this very intermixture, taking place as it usually does between an European father and a native mother, tends to di- minish the number of the native population in a very remarkable manner ; for there is now a large amount of evidence, that when a native female of the American or Polynesian races has once been impregnated by an European male, she thenceforth loses all power of conception from intercourse with * This is well seen in the case of the descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty and of Tahitian women, who now occupy Pitcair'n's Island. the male of her own race. This was first pointedly stated by that very intelligent tra- veller, the Count de Strzelecki, who has lived much among different races of abo- rigines, the natives of Canada, of the United States, of California, Mexico, the South American Republics, the Marquesas, Sand- wich, and Society Islands, New Zealand, and Australia, and who affirms that in hundreds oj cases of this kind into which he has inquired, and of which he preserves memoranda, there has not been a single exception.* As regards Australia and New Zealand, this statement, strange as it seems at first sight, has been fully borne out by independent evidence ; and it offers the most complete explanation yet given, of the very rapid de- crease in the native population of the various islands of Oceania, in which European races have been long established. Nothing pre- cisely analogous is known in any other case. Instances of the influence of the father of a first offspring upon subsequent off- spring by another father, are so frequent, as to have given rise to a current be- lief among the breeders of domesticated animals, that such is the fact; and the very ingenious hypothesis has been suggested by Mr. M'Gillivray, and ably advocated by Dr. Harvey, that the female parent in such a ca*e becomes inoculated with the qualities of the male, through the blood of the foetus, which partakes of the latter. But there is no known case, in w hich impregnation of a female by a male of a different species or variety has ren- dered her subsequently infertile to males of her own; on the contrary, the facts just re- ferred to, as to the extension of the influence of the first father over the subsequent progeny, indicate that such is not the case. Hence this peculiarity affords no ground whatever for the establishment of a specific distinction between the two races ; and the invalidity of such a distinction is at once indicated by the fact, that the peculiarity in question does not hold good in regard to the African races, the fertility of the Negro female with the male of her own race not being apparently impaired by previous fruitful intercourse with the European male, a kind of intercourse which is notoriously common in the West India Islands, and in the slave-holding states of North and South America.f * See the Count de Strzelecki's Physical Descrip- tion of New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, pp. 345—347.; and Dr. Harvey's Papers on the In- oculation of the Maternal System with the Pecu- liarities of the Paternal, through the Foetus in Utero, in the Edinb. Monthly Journal for October, 1849, and October and Kovember, 1850. f It may be, as suggested by Dr. Harvey (loc. cit.), that the final purpose of this curious provision should be to replace the least improvable races by a population of a much higher order; the aboriginals thus becoming extinct without violence, but in the natural course of things; and their places being oc- cupied either by half-breeds or Europeans. And, on the other hand, the immunity of the Negro may be designed to preserve his tenure of those parts of the earth, whether in subserviency to the European or independently of him, where," by reason of the1342 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. The Psychical comparison of the various races of mankind is really, in a practical point of view, the most important department of the whole investigation ; and yet it has been the most neglected, until Dr. Prichard took up the inquiry. Whilst the capaciousness of the skulls of the Negro and European has been measured and compared, but little account has been taken of the workings of the brains which they contained. The colour of the skin, the flatness or projection of the nose, the lankness or crispness of the hair, the straightness or curvature of the limbs, have been scrutinised and contrasted, as if these alone constituted the proper description of Man; though it is surely in his mental cha- racter and its manifestations, that the attri- butes of humanity peculiarly consist. The tests by which we recognise the claims of the outcast and degraded of our own coun- try to a common humanity, are surely the same as those by which we should estimate the true relation of the Negro, the Bushman, or the Australian, to the cultivated European. We must not judge of their capabilities solely by their manner of life, however wretched that may be ; since this is often, in great degree, forced upon them by external circum- stances. Nor have we any right to pronounce them incapable of entertaining any particular class of ideas, simply because we cannot find the traces of these in their existing forms of expression. It is only when such people have been attentively studied — not by passing travellers, who, though they may pick up a little of their language, see little of their inner life,—but by residents who have suc- ceeded in gaining acquaintance with habits which a jealous reserve would conceal, and ideas which the imperfections of language render most difficult of transmission *, that we have any right to affirm what they are ; and even this amount of information affords little means of judging what they may be- come. It will be only when the effect of education, intellectual, moral, and religious, has been fairly tested, that we shall be entitled to speak of any essential and constant psychical differ- ence between ourselves and the most degraded beings clothed in a human form. It will only be when the influence of a perfect equality in civilisation and social position has been in- effectually brought to bear upon them for several consecutive generations, that we shall be entitled to say, of the Negro or of any other race, that it is separated by an " impassable barrier " from those which arrogate to them- selves an inalienable superiority in intellectual and moral endowments. All our present knowledge on this subject tends to show that high temperature, the European cannot toil in the way or to the degree which the cultivation of those regions requires. * A curious example of the difficulty of fully comprehending the import of abstract terms, in a language which has been so much studied, both by linguists and by philologists, as the Chinese, will bo found in the Athenajum for March 1. 18ol. no such barrier exists, and that there is a real community of psychical characters among the different races of men ; the differences in the degree of their positive and relative de- velopment, not being greater than those which exist in the successive or contemporaneous varieties of our own race. And it may be added, too, that in almost every instance, the more we learn concerning any particular nation or tribe reputed to possess the meanest possible aspect of humanity, the more we generally have to recede from the harshness of our first impressions. A very striking example of the near affinity that may exist between the most degraded "outcasts of humanity," and races consider- ably advanced in civilisation and intelligence, is presented by the relationship of the Bush- men of the Cape of Good Hope to the Hot- tentot population which tenanted that region previously to the arrival of European colonists. The following is a graphic account recently given of them by one who has had ample opportunities of observation: — " The Dutch Boer, the Griqua, the Bechuana, the Kaffir, all entertain the same dread of, and aversion to, these dwarfish hordes, who, armed with their diminutive bows and poisoned arrows, recklessly plunder and devastate, without regard either to nation or colour, and are in their turn hunted down and destroyed like beasts of prey, which in many respects they so nearly resemble. . . . Time, a knowledge of, and an occasional intercourse with, people more civilised than themselves, have made little change in the habits and disposition of this extraordinary race. The Bushman still continues unrelentingly to plunder, and cruelly to destroy, whenever the opportunity presents itself. His residence is still amongst inacces- sible hills, in the rude cave or cleft of the rock — on the level karroo, in the shallow burrow, scooped out with a stick, and shel- tered with a frail mat. He still, with deadly effect, draws his diminutive bow, and shoots his poisoned arrows against man and beast. Disdaining labour of any kind, he seizes when he can on the farmers' herds and flocks, recklessly destroys what he cannot devour, wallows for consecutive days with vultures and jackals amidst the carcases of the slain, and, when fully gorged to the throat, slumbers in lethargic stupor like a wild beast, till, aroused by hunger, he is compelled to wander forth again in quest of prey. When he can- not plunder cattle, he eagerly pursues the denizens of the waste, feasts indifferently on the lion or the hedgehog, and, failing such dainty morsels, philosophically contents him- self with roots, bulbs, locusts, ants, pieces of hide steeped in water, or, as a last resource, he tightens his 'girdle of famine,' and, as Pringle says,— ' He lays him down, to sleep away, Iu languid trance, the weary day.' Whether this precarious mode of existence may, or may not, have influenced the personal appearance and stature of the Bushmen it isVARIETIES C difficult to say, but a more wretched-looking set of beings cannot easily be imagined. The average height of the men is considerably under five feet, that of the women little ex- ceeding four. Their shameless state of nearly complete nudity, their brutalised habits of voracity, filth, and cruelty of disposition, ap- pear to place them completely on a level with the brute creation, whilst the ' clicking ' tones of a language, composed of the most unpro- nounceable and discordant noises, more re- semble the jabbering of apes than sounds uttered by human beings."* Now, there is ample evidence that the Cape Bushmen are a degraded caste of the Hotten- tot race. They agree with the Hottentots in all the peculiarities of physiognomy, cranial conformation, &c, by which the latter are cha- racterised ; and a careful comparison of the languages of the two races has shown that there is an essential affinity between them. It has been ascertained by Dr. Andrew Smith, that many of the Bushman hordes vary their speech designedly, by affecting a singular mode of utterance (employing the peculiar clapping or clicking of the tongue, which is characteristic of the Hottentot language, so incessantly, that they seem to be giving utter- ance to a jargon consisting of an uninterrupted succession of claps), and even adopting new words, in order to make their meaning unin- telligible to all but the members of their own community. According to the same autho- rity, nearly all the South African tribes who have made any advances in civilisation, are surrounded by more barbarous hordes, whose abodes are in the wilderness and in the fast- nesses of mountains and forests, and who con- stantly recruit their numbers by such fugitives as crime and destitution may have driven from their own more honest and thriving communities. In this manner it has happened that within a comparatively recent period many tribes of Hottentots have been de- graded into Bushmen, through the oppres- sions to which they have been subjected at the hands of their more civilised neighbours. Now, although of the Hottentots them- selves we are accustomed to form a very low estimate, — our ideas of them having been chiefly derived from the intercourse of the Cape settlers with the tribes which have been their nearest neighbours, and which have un- fortunately undergone that deterioration which is so often found to be the first result of the contact of civilised with comparatively savage nations,—it appears from the accounts of them given by Dutch writers at the time of the first settlement of the Cape, that they were a people considerably advanced in civi- lisation, and possessed of many estimable qualities. Their besetting sins seem to be indolence and a love of drink (in this respect strongly resembling the Irish); yet when they can be induced to apply, they show no want of capacity or vigour. The testimony of * Lieut-Colonel E. E. Napier's Excursions in Southern Africa. F MANKIND. 1343 Lieut.-Col. Napier is very strong as to their merits as soldiers when officered by Euro- peans ; " and it has been," he says, " on the Cape Mounted Rifles, composed chiefly of this race, that many of the greatest hardships, fatigues, and dangers of the last and former Kaffir wars have principally fallen." * It has been frequently said that the Hottentots differ from the higher races, in their incapacity to form or to receive religious ideas. This is, however, by no means true. The early Dutch settlers describe them as having a definite religion of their own ; and it was their obsti- nate adhesion to this, which was the real ob- stacle to the introduction of Christianity among them. When the attempt was per- severingly made and rightiy directed, the Hottentot nation lent a more willing ear than any other race in a similar condition has done to the preaching of Christianity; and no people has been more strikingly and speedily improved by its reception. Now, if we compare the condition of these people with that of the lowest members of the population of countries that claim to be most advanced in civilisation, we find that the difference is not so great as it might at first appear. Unfortunately, there is scarcely a civilised nation, in the very bosom of which there does not exist an outcast population, neither less reckless, nor less prone to the indulgence of their worst passions, than the miserable Bushmen, and only restrained from breaking loose by external coercion. The want of forethought and wild desire of re- venge, which are said to be among the most striking characteristics of the Bushmen, are scarcely less characteristic of those classes dangereuses, which, as often as the arm of the law is paralysed, issue from the unknown deserts of our great towns, and rival in their excesses of wanton cruelty, the most terrible exhibitions of barbarian inhumanity. So, again, there is nothing in the inaptitude of any barbarous tribe for religious impressions, which surpasses that of the young heathens of our own land, who, when first induced to attend a " ragged school," are recorded to have mingled " Jim Crow" with the strains of adoration in which they were invited to join, and to have done their best, by grimaces and gestures, to distract the attention of those who were fixing their thoughts on the solemn offering of prayer ; or of those who, after having joined with apparent sincerity in reli- gious worship, simultaneously took their de- parture as the hour approached for the break- ing up of the city congregations, in order that they might " go to work," as they expressed it; that is, that they might exert their thievish ingenuity upon the dispersing crowds. Now if, on the one hand, we admit the influence of want, ignorance, and neglect, in accounting for the debasement of the savages of our own * The conduct of this corps in the recent out- break (March 20. 1851), is stated by the Governor to have been most admirable.

The latter, like the former, have a secret or " slang " language of their own, adapted for the con- cealment of their designs; and, as already mentioned, they are generally characterised by the great de- velopment of the facial in proportion to that of the cranial part of the skull. The one tribe of " nomads," like the other, " is distinguished from civilised man, by his repugnance to regular and continuous labour; by his want of providence in laying up a store for the future; by his inability to perceive consequences ever so slightly removed from immediate apprehension; by his passion for stupifying herbs and. roots, and, when possible, for intoxicating fermented liquors; by his extraordinary powers of enduring pain; by an immoderate love of gaming, frequently risking his own personal liberty upon a single cast; by his love of libidinous dances; by the pleasure he experiences in witnessing the suffering of sentient creatures; by his delight in warfare and all perilous sports; by his desire for vengeance; by the looseness of his notions as to property; by the absence of chastity among his women, and his disregard of female honour; and lastly, by his vague sense of religion, his rude idea of a Creator, and utter absence of all appreciation of the mercy of the Divine Spirit." It is further re- markable that the nomadic tribes seem to possess (sometimes hereditarily, sometimes as an acquired habit) such a constitutional adaptation to a wan- dering life, that, despite its privations, its dangers, and its hardships, they can rarely be induced to abandon it. It is well known that among the many instances in which the aborigines of Australia or of North America have been brought up and educated from an early age amongst Europeans, there are few, if any, in which they have been satisfied to to remain and to adopt the habits of civilised life. On approaching manhood, they become restless, and take the first opportunity of absconding to join their brethren in " the bush." So, again, there are numerous examples of white men adopting, by their own choice, all the usages of the Indian hunter or Australian bushman; and these, having once imbibed a fondness for the nomadic life, are as irreclaimable as those who have grown up in it. The same is the case, according to Mr. Mayhew, with a large proportion of the "street-folk" of London ; who will give up situations affording com- forts and advantages of a far superior order, to return to the indulgence of their wandering pro- pensity. for a moment be assumed as the basis for specific distinctions between them. If the Negro, for -example, is at present far behind the European standard, yet, under favourable circumstances, the intellect and moral charac- ter of individual Negroes have been elevated to it; while, on the other hand, we have too frequent proof that the intellect and moral character of the European are capable, not merely in individuals, but in families and groups of people, of sinking even below the average African standard. It is the observa- tion of all who have had experience in the education of the children of races reputed to be inferior, such as Negroes, Hottentots, and Australians, that their capacity is at least equal to that of the lowest class of our own youthful town population, and that their do- cility is, if anything, greater. That this mental development is generally checked at an early age, and that the adults of these races too frequently remain through life in the condition of " children of a larger growth," may be freely conceded. But observation of the difference in developmental power, between the mind of the descendant of an educated ancestry, and that of the descendant of an ignorant and uncultivated peasantry, shows that within the limits of the same race the same difference may exist; and nothing is more likely to main- tain it, than the absence of any encourage- ment to advancement, and the persistence, on the part of society at large, in the doctrine that the Negro never can be admitted within the pale of white civilisation. Looking to the fact already mentioned (p. 1341.), as to the^absence of that tendency to extinction in the African races, by sexual contamination from Europeans, which shows itself so remarkably among other aborigines, it is not a little interesting to observe, that there are elements in the Negro character, which have been deemed, by competent ob- servers, capable of working a considerable improvement in even Anglo-Saxon civilisa- tion. Many intelligent ihinkers have come to the conclusion, that the boasted superiority of the latter is, after all, more intellectual than moral; and that in purity and disinterested- ness of the affections, in childlike simplicity and gentleness of demeanour, in fact, in all the milder graces of the Christian temper, we may have even much to learn of the despised Negro. " I should expect," says Channing, "from the African race, if civilised, less energy, less courage, less intellectual ori- ginality than in ours; but more amiableness, tranquillity, gentleness, and content. They might not rise to an equality in outward con- dition, but would probably be a much happier race." And it is to be remembered that these and similar remarks have been made respect- ing the Negroes of the Guinea coast, or their descendants, who are, as we shall presently see, the most degraded of all the African races, except those of the neighbourhood of the Cape, whose degradation has been in great measure the result of European oppression, and the introduction of European vices. ItVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 134.5 is not a little remarkable that the earliest civilisation of which we have any distinct traces in the western portion of the Old World, — perhaps the very earliest develop- ment of the arts of life and of a spiritual phi- losophy that man has witnessed — should have presented itself in a race which was not only African in its locality, but also in its affinities, such being demonstrably the character of the Ancient Egyptians, as will be seen hereafter. Yet to this race the civilisation of Greece, of Rome, and of Western Europe may be in great measure ascribed; and long after the time when its power and intelligence had gained their highest state of development, the progenitors of the Anglo-Saxon race, both in Britain and in Germany, were in a state of barbaric ignorance and brutalism. Referring, for the particulars of this part of the enquiry, to the valuable collection of in- formation brought together by Dr. Prichard chiefly from the records of the Moravian mis- sionaries who have planted themselves over almost every portion of the habitable globe, and who have gained a more intimate ac- quaintance with the mental habits and feelings of the people among whom they dwell, than has been acquired by any other class of Eu- ropean settlers; the following may be adopted as its general results : — In all the races of mankind, with which any adequate acquaint- ance has been gained, unequivocal indi- cations may be discerned of the same moral and intellectual nature as that which the most civilised tribes exhibit ; and these indications become more obvious, the more complete is our knowledge of their habits, not merely of action, but of thought. We can trace, in short, among all the tribes who are endowed with the faculty of articulate speech, the same rational, human nature; superior to that of the highest brutes, not merely in the com- plexity of the processes which it is capable of performing, but in that capacity for generating abstract ideas, and thus arriving at general principles, which, so far as we have the means of judgment, appears to be the distinguishing attribute of man. So, again, we discover in all of them the same elements of moral feeling; the same sympathies and susceptibilities of affection; the same conscience, or internal conviction of accountableness, more or less fully developed ; the same sentiments of guilt and self-condemnation, and the same desire for expiation. These principles take very different forms of expression, even in civilised life; much more, therefore, ought we to be prepared for finding nothing more, even among the best specimens of uncivilised barbarism, than the mere rudiments of a higher under- standing, and of a nobler moral nature, than that which they have at present reached. But the rudiments are there, though not always in the same degree of forwardness for being moulded to the institutions of a more regular society, for the development of the intellectual powers under a rational education, and for that growth of the moral and religious sentiments which Christianity is pre-eminently VOL. IV. fitted to promote in every mind that opens itself to its benign influence. The general conclusion, then, which we seem entitled to draw from the Anatomical, Physiological, and Psychological facts to which reference has been made, is that all the human races may have had a common origin ; since they all possess the same constant cha- racters, and differ only in those which can be shown to vary from generation to genera- tion.—We have now to inquire, lastly, into the bearing of philological evidence upon the same question ; and as this department of the inquiry is more foreign than the preceding to the character of the present work, a brief notice of its chief results is all that can be here admitted. These results, it may be re- marked, are of extremely recent acquisition. In fact, there is no department of ethnology in which progress is at present so rapid, as it is in the study of glottology. Now it may be observed, in the first place, that what has been just said of the com- munity of psychical nature amongst the se- veral races of mankind, is very strongly con- firmed by the general fact of the universality of spoken language, and of the power of trans- lating from one language to another. Dogs and monkeys may have languages of their own ; but there is no such relation between these and ours, as may enable us to com- prehend them ; and where brute animals have been taught to comprehend human lan- guage, it has been only so far as to acquire a mental association between the sounds of certain words, and the material objects which they represent. This is but the first and simplest stage of the acquirement of language, as every one must perceive, who watches the development of the power of communication by this means, in early childhood. A very large part of all languages, but especially of those employed by nations advanced in in- tellectual culture, consists of terms expressive of ideas and relations, rather than of material objects; and it is in the capacity for ex- pressing the former, that the distinctive at- tributes of human language appear specially to consist. This capacity, though existing more or less in all languages, will obviously vary considerably in degree, according to the in- tellectual culture of the people of whose thoughts they are the habitual expression; and the power of fully rendering the thoughts conveyed by one language into another tongue, must of course depend in great part upon the relative advancement of the two. The abstractions of a German transcendental philosopher do not always admit of being ef- fectively conveyed, even in a tongue so nearly related as the English to their original, far less could they be translated into Hottentot gibberish. So, again, the peculiar style of eloquence cultivated in the East, does not produce its adequate effect, when rendered in Western tongues. But any two barbarous languages, or any two which are highly cul- tivated, are, on the whole, so pervaded by a 4 R1346 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. sameness of character, as to bear witness to the similarity of their internal source. The affinities between languages are sought by philologists in two entirely different di- rections ; namely, in their vocabularies, and in their methods of grammatical construction. In comparing the former, it is of course ne- cessary to make due allowance for the pos- sible influence of conquest, intermixture, or frequent intercourse, in modifying the original tongues ; but the experienced enquirer may generally eliminate this source of error, by placing his chief reliance on what are termed primary ivords, i. e. on words which serve to represent the universal ideas of a people in the most simple state of existence. Such are the terms expressive of family relations ; the names of the most striking objects of the visible universe, the sun, moon, stars, trees, rivers, &c. ; terms distinguishing the prin- cipal parts of the body, as the head, eyes, hands, and feet; the numerals, up to five, ten, or twenty ; and verbs descriptive of the most common sensations and bodily acts, such as seeing, hearing, eating, drinking, sleeping. Such primary words are never wanting in the language of any nation ; and it has been ascer- tained by observation, that they are the last to undergo change, either in the spontaneous modifications which take place in the course of time, or under the disturbing influence of a foreign idiom ; so that a conformity in primary words affords very strong evidence of a community of origin among the nations which exhibit it.—The evidence afforded by conformity in grammatical construction, re~ quires a more intimate acquaintance than is needed for the preceding, with what is some- times called the genius of the language; but when it has been gained, it is frequently even more important than that furnished by the vocabularies. For there are many cases in which the latter are so continually under- going important changes (the want of written records allowing them to possess no more than a traditional permanence), that the diver- gence of tongues becomes so great, in the course of even a few generations, as to prevent tribes descended from a common ancestry from understanding one another ; and yet the system of grammatical construction, which depends more upon the grade of mental de- velopment, and upon the habits of thought, exhibits a remarkable permanence. The following are the principal types of construction, or " methods by which the re- lation between the different words that con- stitute sentences is indicated," according to a very recent and distinguished authority.* I. The Aptotic type, of which the Chinese is an example. In this, there is a total ab- sence of inflections ; and the words which, in languages of the classical form, do the work of the inflections, that is, express the relations of the principal words to each other, are themselves most commonly the names of * Dr. E. G. Latham, on the Natural History of the Varieties of Man, p. 9. jobjects and actions, i. c, nouns and verbs. " Thus if," says Dr. Latham, "instead of say- ing, / go to London, Jigs come from Turkey, the sun shines through the air, we said I go end London, figs come origin Turkey, the sun shines passage air, we should discourse after the manner of the Chinese." This is the lowest grade of linguistic development. 2. The Agglutinate type, which is carried to its fullest extent in the American lan- guages. These possess inflexions, which can be generally shown to have arisen out of the juxta-position and composition of different words, the incorporation not having been suf- ficiently complete wholly to disguise the ori- ginally independent and separate character of the inflexional addition. This may be re- garded as a decided advance in development. 3. The Amalgamate type, of which the classical languages are the most perfect ex- amples. These possess a very complete system of inflexions, which express the relation be- tween the fundamental idea denoted by the term, and some other ; and these inflexions are so completely incorporated with the root with which they are conjoined, that their existence as separate and independent words cannot be demonstrated, and can only be sup- ported upon the analogy of the agglutinate languages. Thus, " in a word like hominem, there are two parts, homin, radical; em, in- flexional. In the word te-tig-i, there are the same. The power of these parts is clear. The tig- and homin- denote the simple action or the simple object. The te- denotes the time in which it takes place ; the i, the agent. In the proposition te-tig-i homin-em, the em denotes the relation between the object (the man touched) and the action (of touching). logically, there are two ideas, e. g. that of the action or object, and that of the super- added conditions in respect to time, agency, and relation." 4. The Anaptotic type, of which the English is an example. This designation is given to languages which were once inflexional, but which have in great part ceased to be so. In such we find that the auxiliary words which do the work of the Greek and Latin inflexions, are not names of objects and actions like those of the Chinese language, but possess (generally speaking) a purely abstract value, having a meaning only when in context with other words. Thus, where the Roman said te-tig-i, we say, I have touched ; where the Roman said patri, we say to father; where a Roman said tangam, we say, I will (or shall) touch. In many of these auxiliary words, however, an independent meaning can be clearly seen ; thus have and will are obviously verbs in their own right; and the conjunction if is a corruption of the Saxon gif (give). Moreover, the inflexions are seldom or never wholly disused; so that these anaptotic languages always preserve relations of affinity to those of the two preceding types, of which they may be considered a peculiar development. To one or other of these types, or to tran-VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1347 4 R 2 sitional grades between them, it is believed that all existing languages may be referred. It is remarkable that the development of a language should not by any means correspond to the advance of civilisation, so far, at least, as this is manifested by progress in the arts of life. The Chinese, for instance, of all known languages, most completely preserves, in a fixed or stereotyped condition, that earliest phase in the development of speech, in which every word corresponded to, or represented, a substantial object in the outward world ; and it cannot be denied that a considerable amount of intellectual development is to be found amidst that people. And from what is known of the ancient Egyptian language, this appears to have been nearly in the same con- dition. On the other hand, there are many languages of comparatively barbarous nations, even belonging to the same group with the Chinese, which possess much greater flexi- bility. The highest development of language however, is undoubtedly to be found coinci- dent with the highest intellectual cultivation ; since this pre-eminently shows itself in the Indo-European tongues, of which the Sanscrit may be taken as the type, the Hellenic pre- senting its highest development in the amalga- mate form, and the English in the anaptotic. In both these do we find that the general plan of construction tends to give to every single word a fixed and definite meaning, and at the same time, to render it subservient to the general idea that the sentence is to unfold, which is obviously the great end and aim of language; whilst in the Chinese, every spoken word has an immense variety of meanings, and its import being determined, partly by its place in the sentence, partly by the tones or accents with which it is pronounced, and in the written language by an immense number of conventional signs derived from figurative sources, which are destined, not to express sounds, but to suggest ideas, and thus to assist the reader in guessing the meaning of the word. Now the most positive evidence which philology is able to afford, in regard to the affinities of two languages, is undoubtedly that which is derived from their conformity both in vocabulary and in grammar. But it fre- quently happens that one of these kinds of evidence is deficient; and the degree of reli- ance that can be placed upon the other, taken alone, must depend greatly upon the circum- stances of the individual case. Thus, if there be evidence that the vocabulary of one of these languages is in a state of continual change, an entire difference of vocabularies is no obstacle to the idea of the affinity between two languages, when this is decidedly indi- cated by a striking conformity in their systems of construction. On the other hand, when two languages or groups of languages differ greatly in their construction, but present a certain degree of verbal correspondence, full weight may be attached to that correspond- ence, if it can be proved that it has not been the result of intercourse subsequently to the divergence of the stock, and if it can be shown to be probable that their separation took place at a period when as yet the grammatical development of both languages was in its in- fancy. The first appears to be true of the American languages, which seem, as a whole, to be legitimately referable to a common stock, notwithstanding their complete verbal diversity. The second is the aspect under which it appears likely that the Indo-European or Japetic, and the Syro-Arabian or Semitic groups of languages will come to present themselves ; the results of the recent labours of Rawlinson, Layard, Botta and others, on Eastern Archaeology, tending decidedly in this direction. Philological inquiry, then, must be looked to as the chief means of determining the question of radiation from a single centre or from multiple centres ; and although, in the present state of this department of science it would be unsafe to venture on a positive con- clusion, yet the following may be considered as the principal groups under which the various languages hitherto studied may be arranged. 1. The Indo-European, sometimes termed Indo-German, frequently Japetic, and by late writers Arian, or Iranian. This group com- prehends nearly all the existing languages of Europe, and those of a portion of South- western Asia. 2. The Sj/ro-Arabian, often termed Semitic; which are spoken by a large part of the popu- lation of Syria, Arabia, and Northern and Eastern Africa. 3. The Turanian, or Ugro-Tartarianj which are spoken by the (Mongolian) people of High Asia and of certain parts of Northern Europe. 4. The Seriform, or Indo-Chinese ; which are spoken by the people of South-Eastern Asia. 5. The African ; which are spoken by the people of Central and Southern Africa. 6. The Malayo-Poh/nesian ; which are spoken by the inhabitants of the numerous islands and island-continents of Oceania. 7. The American ; which are spoken by the inhabitants of the New World, from the Arctic Sea to Cape Horn. Now it is not a little curious that the linguistic affinity should often be strongest, where the conformity in physical characters is slightest, and weakest when this is strongest. Thus among the Malavo-Polynesian and the American races, as already remarked, there are very striking differences in conformation, features, complexion, &c.; and yet the lin- guistic affinity of the great mass of tribes forming each group is not now doubted by any philologist, though a doubt may still hang over some particular cases. On the other hand, the hiatus between the Turanian and the Seriform languages is very wide ; but the physical conformity is so strong between the Chinese and the typical Mongolian nations, that no ethnologist has ever thought of as-1348 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. signing to them a distinct origin. So, again, there would seem to be no near relationship between the American and the Turanian lan- guages ; but the affinity of the two stocks appears to be established by the transition- link afforded by the Esquimaux, which are Mongolian in their conformation and Ame- rican in their language. The affinity of the Semitic and Japetic languages, moreover, is so deeply hidden, as to have, until recently, almost defied discovery; and yet the people who speak them so far resemble one another in physical characters, that they have been almost invariably associated together under the general designation of the Caucasian race. The common origin of the inhabitants of the continents of Europe, Asia, and America is thus pointedly indicated by the combination of these two sources of evidence. The por- tion of the Malayo-Polynesian race, that is, in nearest proximity with South-Eastern Asia, presents such a striking] resemblance in phy- sical characters to the inhabitants of the neighbouring part of that great continent, that their community of origin can scarcely be doubted ; and when certain points of re- semblance between some of the Oceanic and Indian dialects are taken into account, this inference receives strong confirmation. The African nations have long been regarded as the most isolated from the common centre from which all the others appear to have radiated ; but recent investigations have shown that such isolation has no real existence. For, on the one hand, there are tribes which form (like the Esquimaux) a connecting link between the Semitic and proper African fa- milies, being African in their conformation, but Semitic in their language ; and, on the other, the study which has been recently be- stowed on the proper African languages, especially by Dr. Latham, has shown them to have so much in common with the Semitic tongues, that, with the additional evidence derivable from community of certain usages, extending through vast areas physically iso- lated from each other, it now seems impos- sible to believe but that the African nations are nearly related to the Semitic, and are through them, derivable from the great Asiatic centre. IV. General Survey of the principal Families of Mankind. In the summary view v hich will now be presented, of the characters of the principal varieties of the human race, it will be con- venient, in the first instance, to arrange them according to their existing geographical dis- tribution, stating, under each head, the most important peculiarities in physical conforma- tion, in psychical character, and in language, which they may respectively present. A ge- neral scheme of their probable relations of affinity will be subsequently given. I. European Nations. — The collective body of European nations, with the excep- tion of the Lapps, present a great uniformity in physical characters; for although minor differences exist among their subordinate groups, they all possess the elliptical cranium, the symmetrical form, the xanthous com- plexion, and the flowing hair, which cha- racterise what is ordinarily designated as the Caucasian variety. This group of nations, however, must be primarily divided into those of Avian or Indo-Median origin, and those whose origin is probably or certainly Mon- golian. Under the latter head may be ranked (as already remarked) the Lapps and Finns of Scandinavia; the Magyars of Hungary; the Turks of Turkey ; not improbably the Basques or Euskaldunes of Biscay and Na- varre ; and (possibly) the Albanians or moun- taineers of ancient lllyria and Epirus.* The European tribes of the Arian stock are con- sidered by Dr. Latham as fundamentally di- visible into the two great groups of Celts and Indo-Germans. The former seem to have de- tached themselves from the common stock, be- fore the evolution of the language had pro- ceeded to the formation of the cases of the nouns, but after that of the persons of the verbs had taken place")"; and their language presents obvious traces of agglutination, which, as already shown, marks an early stage in lin- guistic developement. The eastern origin of the Celtic nations was first demonstrated by Dr. Prichard j, and has been subsequently more fully proved by Pictet.§ The typical Celts exhibit somewhat of that development of the malar bones, which is carried to its fullest extent in the pyramidal skull ; and in their comparatively unprogressive psychical character they contrast remarkably with the Germanic group of nations. The Indo-Ger- mans, on the other hand, seem to have de- tached themselves from the common stock after the evolution of the cases of nouns had taken place ; ami their language presents less evidence of agglutination than does the Celtic. The Eastern origin of this group of nations is not now doubted by any competent ethno- logist ; for their languages, in spite of their diversity, constitute but one philological group, being united alike by community in many of the most important primary words, and by general similarity of grammatical construc- tion ; and being obviously all formed upon the same base with the Sanscrit, if not upon that language itself. Of all extant European dialects, the Lettish and Lithuanian approach most nearly to the ancient Sanscrit ; but a still nearer approach seems to have been presented by the old Prussian, a dialect now extinct, which maintained, to the sixteenth century, a very slightly changed form of the Zend or Median language, which was an early deriva- tion from the Sanscrit. Whilst every one of the Indo-Germanic languages bears traits of * See on this last point Dr. Latham's " Natural History of the Varieties of Man," p. 552. t Op. cit. p. 529. j On the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations, 1831. § De l'Affinite' ties Langues Celtiques avec le Sanscrit; Paris, 1837.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 134-9 affinity with every other, each has been mo- dified by the introduction of extraneous elements. Thus, in those of Western Eu- rope, there is a considerable admixture of Celtic ; whilst in others there are traces of more barbaric tongues. In fact, there can be little doubt, that Europe had an indigenous population before the immigration of the Indo- German or even of the Celtic tribes ; and of this population it seems most probable that the Lapps and Finns of Scandinavia, and the Euskarians of the Biscayan provinces, are the remnant. There is evidence that the former of these tribes once extended much further south than at present; and, on the other hand, there is ample proof that the latter had formerly a very extensive distribution through Southern Europe. It has been clearly shown by William Von Humboldt, that the Eusk- arian language, so far from having been de- rived (as some writers have supposed) from the Celtic, must have been in existence long anterior to the immigration of the Celtic nations into Western Europe; and since that time, it has been shown to have affinities with the Finnish tongue, and through this with the languages of High Asia. It may be sur- mised, then, that the advance of the Indo- European tribes, from the south-east corner into central Europe, separated that portion of the aboriginal population, which they did not destroy or absorb, into two great divisions ; of which one was gradually pressed north- ward and eastward, so as to be restricted to Finland and Lapland; and the other south- ward and westward, so as to be confined at the earliest historic period to a part of the peninsula of Spain and the South of France, gradually to be driven before the successive irruptions of the Celts, Romans, Arabians, and other nations, until their scanty remnant found an enduring refuge in the fastnesses of the Pyrenees.* It is curious that the Eusk- arian language should carry out the principle of agglutination to an extent which has no parallel among the languages of the Old World, and which is only surpassed by those of America. The Indo-Germanic race are unquestionably those which are destined to acquire the greatest predominance, not only in the Old World, but in all those newly-found lands which have been discovered by their enterprise. With scarcely any exception, as Dr. Latham has justly remarked, they present an encroaching frontier; there being no instance of their per- manent displacement by any other race, save in the case of the Arab dominion in Spain, * This view, which was suggested by the Author (British and Foreign Medical Review, Oct. 1847) without the knowledge that it had been elsewhere propounded, has been put forth with considerable confidence by Dr. Latham (Varieties of Man, p. 551.) as originating with Arndt, and adopted by J ask, distingmshsd Scandinavian ethnologists. Ths great, antiquity of the Albanian tongue having been fully proved, and the circumstances of the tribe having been nearly the same, it is suggested by Dr. Latham that this, too, may be a remnant of the abo- riginal Turanian population. which has long since ceased ; in that of the Turkish dominion in Turkey and Asia Minor, which is evidently destined to expire at no distant period, being now upheld only by ex- traneous influence ; and in that of the Magyars in Hungary, who only maintain their ground by their complete assimilation to the Indo- Germanic character. It has been already pointed out, however, that the rapid exten- sion of this race is due, not merely to its superior skill in the arts of war and diplomacy, but to a physical cause which tends to ex- tinguish the aboriginal population of many of the inferior races, wherever sexual inter- course takes place between them (p. 1341.). II. Asiatic Nations. — Whilst in Eu- rope the presence of the Avian family is the rule, and that of the Mongolian is the excep- tion, we find in the vast continent of Asia, that the reverse is the case; the presence of the Arian family being the exception, and that of the Mongolian the rule. In fact, although the Celtic and Indo-Germanic races undoubtedly had their origin in Central or Western Asia, yet the tribes which can, with greatest probability, be regarded as the de- scendants of the ancient stock, are extremely few, and scarcely able to maintain their ground. They are, according to Dr. Latham, the Persians of Northern and Western Persia; the Kurds, the Beluehi, the Affghans, the Tajiks of Bokhara, and the Sia-posh. All these speak languages which contain a large proportion of Sanscrit words ; but whether they are so far akin to the Sanscrit in gram- matical structure, as to hold to it the same relation as that which the European lan- guages possess, is as yet uncertain. Whether or not the Armenians belong to this group, has not yet been ascertained.* It has been generally considered, until recently, that the nations of the great Indian peninsula for the most part belonged to the same stock ; but philological investigation has shown that such a doctrine is certainly untrue with regard to some, and is probably or possibly erroneous with regard to others. The Tamulian, which is the dominant language of Southern India, is undoubtedly not Sanscritic in its origin, although containing an infusion of Sanscritic words, but more closely approximates to the Seriform type. Many of the hill tribes, in different parts of India, speak peculiar dia- lects, which appear referable to the same stock. And in Dr. Latham's opinion, the dialects spoken throughout Northern India are to be regarded in a similar light, notwith- standing the large infusion of Sanscritic words which they contain. Viewed under this aspect, the mass of the population of India is * It is somewhat remarkable that greater atten tion should not have been paid to the study of the Armenian language; as the facilities presented by commercial intercourse are not small; and the iso- lated position of this nation is one which might lead to the anticipation, that its language might retain the Sanscritic type, with less alteration than that of other nations, which have been more affected by conquest and intermixture of races. 4-r 31350 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. not to be regarded as Arian, but as Mon- golian ; and the introduction of the Sanscrit language was accomplished by an invading branch of the Arian stock, the only trace of which is to be found in the distinctness of the Brahminical portion of the Hindoo popu- lation, in whose religious and other writings the Sanscrit language is still preserved. Tn the Asiatic group of Indo-Germanic nations, the same general type of conforma- tion presents itself as in the European : there is, however, a much greater variety of com- plexion. The mountaineers, even within the tropics, are often as fair as Europeans; whilst those who live in the level plains, and are ex- posed to the full heat of the torrid zone, may be of a very deep brown or even black hue. The variety of complexion shown among the Hindoos, even in the Brahminical caste, has been already adverted to. There is but little to remind us of the Mongolian type in the countenances of the Hindoos, which are often remarkable for symmetrical beauty, that only want a more intellectual expression to render them extremely striking ; some traces of it, however, may perhaps be found in the rather prominent zygomatic arches (Jig. 828); Fig. 828. Hindoo Female of Pondicherry. {From a portrait in M. Geringer's " L'lnde Francaise") but this is a character which not unfrequently shows itself strongly in the Arian races (e.g. the Celts) ; and the cranial part of the skull presents no approach to the pyramidal type, being often very regularly elliptical. Among the southern inhabitants of the peninsula, however, a much greater departure from the Caucasian type presents itself; for not only is the colour darker, but the cheek bones are more prominent, the hair coarse, scanty, and straight, the nose flattened; and sometimes the lips are very thick, and the jaws project, so that we have indications of a transition towards both the pyramidal and the progna- thous types. The south-western portion of Asia is occu- pied by the Arabs and other Semitic races, which, as will be presently explained, form the transition between the proper Asiatic and pro- per African nations. The whole remainder of the vast Asiatic continent is occupied by nations which present a sufficiently close approximation to each other, either in physical characters or in lan- guage, or in both, to justify their association in one extensive group, under the name of Mbngolidce. The typical character of this great family of nations, as seen in a Mongolian or a Tungus from Central Asia, consists in the pyramidal form of the skull (Jig. 811. et seq.), with the broad flat face and prominent cheek-bones, and its antero-posterior diameter scarcely exceeding the parietal; the nose is flat, neither arched nor aquiline; the eyes drawn upwardsat their outer angle (fig. 814.); the skin of a swarthy yellow ; the hair straight and scanty, and the beard deficient; and the stature undersized. These characters are softened down in many members of the group ; and may even be entirely wanting, as for in- stance, in the Circassians and Georgians, (p. 1328.), termed by Dr. Latham the Dioscurian Mongolidte. Still they are very extensively distributed ; and there is by no means the same amount of variation in complexion, under the influence of temperature, that is seen in the Indo-Germanic races. The following, accord- ing to Dr. Latham, are the principal groups into which the Asiatic nations may be ar- ranged : — 1. The Seriform stock, distributed over China, Thibet, the Indo-Chinese penin- sula, and the base of the Himalayan range of mountains ; their configuration is Mongolian, softened down (fig. 829.) ; their languages Fig. 829. Sftntl of a Chinese Ludrone. (From a specimen in the Museum o f the Royal College of Surgeons.} are aptotic, or with only the rudiments of an inflexion ; and they thus preserve more thanVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 13.51 4 r 4 any other race, the primitive condition of human speech. In their mode of life, they present the phenomenon of a civilization which has attained a considerable degree of develop- ment, remaining stationary through a very long period of time, and isolating itself as jea- lously as possible from the general current of progress. In passing from China towards India, there is a gradual transition in physical and mental characters, between the Chinese and the Hindoo ; thus the Burmese have more hair and beard, more prominent features, and darker complexions, than the Siamese and Chinese; and the darkness in complexion in- creases towards the confines of Bengal. There is, therefore, no such abrupt transition, as shall make it difficult to admit the Seriform origin of the bulk of the Hindoo population, if fur- ther investigation of their language should render this connection as probable as it has already been shown to be in the case of the in- habitants of the Dekhan and Ceylon.—2. The Turanian stock, including the proper Mongo- lians of High Asia, the Tungusians, the Turks, and the TJgrians. Among these, the con- formity in physical characters is extremely close, the only exception being in the case of the offsets which have migrated into Europe, and which have undergone transformation (as explained at p. 1327.) into the Caucasian type (Jig.8\5ct seq.). The languages of these people are not monosyllabic, but have not undergone any high development; and they are spoken with very little variation over extensive areas. The general character of the country inhabited by this group is remarkably uniform, being a series of high table-lands or steppes, well adapted for maintaining a nomadic pastoral population. Such is the general habit of these people, and such it has been from our earliest knowledge of them. The Tungusians, how- ever, advance to the Polar Sea, and adopt a manner of life more resembling that of the proper Hyperborean races.—3. The Peninsular Mongolidcc, inhabiting the islands and penin- sulas of the north-eastern coast of Asia, such as Korea, Japan, and Kamschatka. These are all Mongol in their conformation, but dif- fer from the preceding in the character of their languages, which seem to be, in some cases, extremely poly-syWnb'xc, always showing a strong tendency to agglutination, and thus showing atransition to the American languages, in which this peculiarity presents its highest development. These tribes are separated from each other, however, by considerable breaks in geographical continuity; some of them lying within the Arctic circle, and others as far south as 26° N. L. And they are not less distant in the two extremes of their social de- velopment, one section of the group partaking of the civilization of China, and another ex- hibiting the rudeness of the Samoied. This group is obviously not a typical, but a transi- tional one.—4. Hyperborean Mongolidcc, in- habiting the borders of the Icy Sea, especially in the neighbourhood of the courses of the large rivers, and subsisting especially by fishing and fur-hunting. The area which they occupy is not continuous ; the principal tribes, known as the Samoiedes, the Yeniseians, and the Yu- kahiri, being separated from each other by the advance of the Northern TJgrians and Tungu- sians. Their conformation is Mongolian ; but their growth is stunted, and their complexion swarthy; and they bear a very close resem- blance to the Laplanders and Esquimaux. It is probable that they will be united when their languages shall have been more fully studied, either with the Turanian or with the Penin- sular stocks. Turning now to the Syro-Arabian or Semitic nations, which occupy a considerable area in the south-western part of Asia, we encounter a very different type of physical conformation, and a group of languages which is peculiar alike in its structure and in its vocabulary. Generally speaking, the people of this race ex- hibit a remarkable symmetry of form, and per- fection of cranial organisation {fig, 830); and it Fig. 830. Arab of the Guard ot the Imaun of 3Iuseat. (From a portrait taken by an officer of L'jArtemise.') was remarked by Baron Larrey, who had ample opportunities for observation during the Egyp- tian expedition, that experience has proved to him that their psychical character is con- formable to this high standard, a great aptitude for intellectual activity being combined with extraordinary acuteness in the use of the or- gans of sense. There can be no doubt what- ever, that the Semitic races have exerted a most important influence on the civilization of the world ; and this not merely by their own early progress in the arts of life (as shown by the extraordinary history of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, on which so much new light has recently been cast) ; but also by having afforded the channel through which Monotheism was transmitted from the patri-1352 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. archal times to that of Moses; by having served as the depository of the Mosaic dispensation, by which that Monotheism was preserved and organised in the Judaical system; and by having been the centre whence has emanated the fuller light of Christianity, which, in the fulness of time, was exhibited among a people blinded by their own prejudices and self- esteem, to be the regenerator of the nations that as yet knew not God. Scarcely less re- markable is it that the third great Monotheistic system—that of Mahommedanism—which; is essentially a degraded mixture of Judaism and Christianity, should have developed itself amongst the same people, occupying the place, on the one hand, of its Divine prototypes, and on the other, of the various inferior religions whose professors have been brought under Arab sway, and forced to embrace the dogma of their conquerors. Wherever this last change has taken place, it has obviously been for the better; and there is no more striking example of it, than the superior condition of the African nations which have been thus brought under Mahommedan influence. And it can be scarcely doubted that it is the pur- pose of Divine Providence, thus to spread and to maintain a Monotheistic system, adapted to the capacities of the people who receive it; until a higher intellectual and moral develop- ment shall render them capable of appreciating the purer light of Christianity. The Semitic languages early attained a considerable development ; but the forms it took were not well adapted for further evolu- tion ; and they present nearly the same type at the present time, as that which is exhibited in the earliest literature which the world pos- sesses : namely, the sacred books of the He- brew nation. Their alphabet was the earliest in the world; and their writing is peculiar in passing in the direction contrary to that of other languages, namely, from right to left. " Of the several nations," remarks Dr. Prichard *, " who are connected by this com- munity of language, some who were formerly celebrated have become nearly extinct; while others have spread themselves, either as the exiled followers of a persecuted faith, or as the enduring apostles of a victorious one, over the world, and seem destined, through the energy of their invincible mind, to survive to the end of time. The Syrian race scarcely exists; their language only survives in some districts on the borders of Kurdistan ; every- where they have been lost under the predomi- nating Arabs. The Homerites in Arabia, if they there exist, are little known ; the Abys- sinian Homerites are the only inhabitants of the province of Tigre, to the eastward of the Tacazze, whose idiom still resembles the an- cient Gheez. The Arabs, who spread Islam by their victories from the Atlantic to the Ganges, and the Jews, who are wanderers over the whole world, are perhaps now more numerous than were even their forefathers." Of the difference in complexion that manifests * Natural History of Man, p. 145. itself among the Arabs of Arabia, mention has already been made ; the greatest modifi- cations of the ordinary type present them- selves, however, among the African members of the Semitic group, as will presently appear. III. African Nations. — Of the various nations inhabiting the African continent, those of the Negro type are usually regarded as the most characteristic specimens. But, as Dr. Latham has justly remarked, " no fact is more necessary to be remembered, than the differ- ence between the Negro and African ; a fact which is well verified by reference to the map. Here the true Negro area, occupied by men of the black skin, thick lip, depressed nose, and woolly hair, is exceedingly small; as small in proportion to the rest of the continent, as the area of the district of the stunted Hyper- boreans is in Asia, or that of the Lapps in Europe." When we have separated the region north of the Great Desert, which is mostly occupied by Semitic tribes; the Great Desert itself, whose scattered population is far from being Negro in many of its features ; the valley of the Nile, at least in its middle and lower portions, including Egypt and Nu- bia, and even Abyssinia ; and the Kaffre and Hottentot areas south of the equator ; there is only left the western portion of the continent, including the alluvial valleys of the Senegal, the Gambia, and the Niger, with a narrow strip of central Africa, passing eastwards to the alluvial regions of the Upper Nile. Even within this area, the true Negro type of con- formation is by no means universally preva- lent ; for many of the nations which inhabit it must be ranked as sub-typical Negroes. Our idea of the Negro character, in fact, is almost exclusively founded upon that division of the race which inhabits the low countries near the Slave Coast ; such tribes, indolent and degraded in an extreme degree, are dis- tinguished alike by their extreme ugliness, and by their brutal sensuality. The proper Negro character consists in the combination of a prognathous form of skull, with receding fore- head and depressed nose, thick lips, woolly hair, black unctuous skin, and crooked legs ; the facial aspect being such as is represented in Jigs. 803, 804. Similar characters are met with, again, among the inhabitants of the al- luvial regions around Lake Tchad, in the interior ; and some of the tribes in the lowest lands on the eastern side are but little superior. On the other hand, in the imme- diate neighbourhood of the typical Negroes, but inhabiting higher levels, and presenting a more advanced civilization, are found a num- ber of tribes departing from the Negro type in one or more of its distinctive characters. Thus the race of Iolofs near the Senegal, and the Guber in the interior of Sudan, have woolly hair and deep black complexions, but fine forms and regular features of the European cast (Jig. 831) ; the high parts of Senegambia, where the temperature is moderate and even cool at times, are inha- bited by Fulahs of a light copper colour; and on nearly the same parallel, but at theVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1353 Fig. 831. Senegal Cliief. (From a portrait taken by an officer in the expedition of Capt. Laplace.) opposite sides of Africa, are the high plains of Enarea and Kaffa, where the inhabitants are said to be fairer than the natives of Southern Europe. So, again, whenever we hear of a Negro state, whose members have attained any considerable degree of improvement in their social condition, we constantly find that their physical characters deviate considerably from the strongly-marked or exaggerated type of the Negro ; such are the Ashanti, the Sulima, and the Dahomans of Western Africa, of which last nation the king is de- scribed by a recent visitor (Lieut. Forbes) as many shades removed from black in his com- plexion, as having quite an intellectual expression of countenance, and as possess- ing a remarkable symmetry of figure. It is obvious, too, from the account given by the same observer*, that a very complex social system has developed itself among this people, and that they have made considerable progress in the arts of life, although this has hitherto been only turned to account in furthering the traffic in slaves, of which Dahomey is now the centre, so far as the Slave Coast is concerned. The highest civilization, and the greatest im- provement in physical characters, are to be found in those nations which have adopted the Mohammedan religion. This was intro- duced, three or four centuries since, into the eastern portion of Central Africa; and it appears that the same people who were then existing in the savage condition still exhibited * Dahomey and the Dahomans, 1851. by the pagan nations further south, have now adopted many of the arts and institutions of civilised society, subjecting themselves to governments, practising agriculture, and dwelling in towns of considerable extent, some containing even as many as 30,000 inhabitants — a circumstance which implies a considerable advancement in industry, and in the resources of subsistence. The languages of the Negro nations, so far as they are known, seem to belong to one group'; although there is a great difficulty in becoming ac- quainted with them; in consequence of the entire deficiency of written records. The same cause would of course give a want of fixity to their vocabulary : and thus the dia- lects of two nations descended from a com- mon original, would be likely soon to diverge from each other. Still they all present, so far as is known, the same grade of develop- ment, and the same grammatical forms ; and various proofs of their affinity with the Semi- tic tongues have been developed, these being derived from similarity alike of roots and of construction. The Semitic affinity of the Negro nations is further indicated in a very remarkable manner, by the existence of a variety of superstitions and usages among the Negroes of the Western Coast, which prevail also among the Nilotic races whose Semitic relations are most clear, as well as among branches of the Semitic stock itself; this is especially the case with the rite of circum- cision, which seems to be universally practised throughout the Negro area. The southern portion of the African con- tinent is inhabited by a group of nations which speak various dialects of the Kaffre tongue, and which recede more or less decidedly from the Negro type in physical characters. Our acquaintance with them, however, is at pre- sent very limited ; the interior of South Africa having been as yet scarcely at all explored by- civilised man; and the only people well known to us being those of a few points on the coast, such as Kongo on one side, and Mozambique on the other ; and those of the southernmost extremity, or the region of the Cape. As we pass southwards from the equatorial region, we find a gradual softening down of the proper Negro characters ; and this is greater according to the degree of civi- lization, and the general improvement in ex- ternal conditions. Thus, in the people of Kongo (fig. 832), and in those of Mozam- bique and its neighbourhood (Jigs. 833, 834), although the hair is woolly and the colour black, yet the skulls are more vaulted (Jig. 833) and capacious anteriorlv, anil have much less of the prognathous cha- racter ; the nose is much more prominent, the lips are less thick, and the general expression is milder and more intellectual, than that of the natives of Guinea. When we arrive at the true Kaff'res, the race of warlike nomadic people which inhabits the eastern parts of South Africa to the northward of the Hot- tentots, so great a departure from the Negro type presents itself, that many travellers have1354 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. Fig. 832. Woman of Kongo. (After Rugendas.") regarded them as having had a different origin. The degree of this departure, however, varies greatly in the different tribes ; for while some of them are black, woolly-headed, decidedly prognathous (fig. 835), and obviously ap- proaching the modified Negroes of Kongo in Fig. 833. Man from Mozambique. (After Rugendas.~) their features and general aspect, others recede considerably both in complexion, features, and form of head from the typical progna- thous races, presenting a light brown colour, high forehead, prominent nose, and tall robust stature. The thick lips and frizzled hair are generally retained, however; but the hair is sometimes of a reddish colour, and becomes flowing; and the features may present a Eu- ropean (fig. 836) cast. Even among the tribes which depart most widely from the Negro-type, individuals are found who present a return to it; and it is interesting to remark, Fig. 834.

Generally speaking, the Kaf- fres are a people very superior in vigour and capacity to the destitute savages who occupy the insulated regions of Negioland, and how a considerable advance in civilization ; but between the most elevated Kaffre and the most degraded Negro, every possible gradation is presented to us, as we pass northwards and westwards from KafFraria towards the Guinea coast, so that no line of distinction between them can be founded on physical characters. So, on the eastern side, we pass up until we meet with the same transition. The languages of these people are distinguished by a set of remarkable characters, which have been con- sidered as isolating them from other African tongues. According to Dr. Latham, how- ever, these peculiarities are not so far without precedent elsewhere, as to establish the very decided line of demarcation which some have attempted to draw ; and may be regarded, in fact, as resulting from the fuller development of tendencies, which manifest themselves in other African languages. The Hottentot race (including the Bush- man) has, perhaps, so far as regards its phy- sical characters, a better title to be considered as forming a distinct species of the genus Homo than any other ; for not only do these characters present a combination which is not found elsewhere, but that transitional grada- tion is wanting, which usually presents itself wherever there is a continuous population that has long occupied the same locality. The peculiarities of these people have been already noticed separately; the following is a general summary of them. The cranium is Mongoli- Fig. 837. form and brachycephalic, the cheek-bones pro- minent, the jaws somewhat projecting, the eyes oblique, the nose broad and flat, the lips thick, the chin long and pointed; the complexion is a mixture of black with yellow ochre ; the hair grows in little tufts ; the stature is low, and the limbs are slight; the buttocks, however, frequently present a steatomatous accumula- tion. In their cranial characters there is, therefore, an admixture of the Mongolian and the Negro, the former being predominant ; and this resemblance to the people of High Asia is the more remarkable, when it is considered that the physical conditions of the Hottentot country bear a very close correspondence with those of High Asia, the habitation of this people being for the most part on karroos, or elevated terraces and table-lands, over which the vision extends with as piercing a gaze as that of the Mongols. The buttock-hump, or stea- topyga, is not by any means so characteristic of this race as lias been imagined ; for, as Mr. Burchell has ascertained, it is only an indi- vidual peculiarity, about as frequent as cor- pulence among European nations ; and it has been met with in other tribes of Southern Africa, as the Makuani of the Mozambique coast. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as affording the least indication of difference of race, but would seem to result from the opera- tion of the same local influences, whatever may be their nature, as produce a similar accumula- tion of fat in the rumps and tails of the sheep inhabiting the same regions. The peculiar relation of the Bushman tribe to the Hottentot race, has been already explained ; among this degraded people, the same general features present themselves as those which have been described as characteristic of the Hottentots (Jigs. 837, 838.), but in stature, vigour, and capacity, they are much inferior.

The ethnological position of the Hottentot race is not altogether clear. There is evidence that it once occupied a more extensive area than it does at present, and that this was much encroached on by the Kaffres, previously to the European colonisation of the Cape. This fact lends weight to a suggestion offered by Dr. Latham, in order to account for the abruptness of the transition between the two races : — " Let two divisions of a certain class pass into each other by imperceptible degrees, and let one of the central portions of either class spread itself at the expense of the parts belonging to its circumference ; the effect w hich follows is, that those portions of the area which represent the phenomena of transition are overlaid or overlapped ; and that, instead of two populations coming into contact by im- perceptible degrees, they meet as separate classes, with as broad a line of demarcation between their respective representatives, at the peripheries of their respective areas, as there was between their central or typical portions. North-western America illustrates this. The more southern Algonkins have overlaid both the Algonkins of their own section which ap- proached the Esquimaux, and the Esquimaux of the opposite section, which approached the Algonkin. Hence the two populations meet as widely-separated and broadly-distinguished varieties of mankind."* So, it may be sur- mised, the bold and warlike Kaffres have over- spread themselves through a region whose aboriginal population exhibited a transition between the Hottentot and Kaffre types. " The language of the Hottentots," says the same learned ethnologist, " can be shown not to be more different from those of the world in general, than they are from each other;" it has not yet, however, been sufficiently studied to enable its true affinities to be known, though some philologists affirm that it is a degraded Kaffre tongue.f * Varieties of Mankind, p. 498. f The author thinks it worth while still to repeat a suggestion which he made some years since; namely, that the Hottentot race is the remnant of an earlier migration from High Asia, than that which was the stock of the great bulk of African nations; and that it has been driven down into the remotest corner of the continent, just as the aboriginal Turanian population of south-western Europe seems Passing now to the valley of the Nile, we find a group of nations whose physical charac- ters and languages present a complete and almost uninterrupted gradation from those of the proper African tribes to those of the Semitic group. Under the general designation of Nilotic nations may be included the Gallas, the Nubians, the Bishari, and many subordi- nate groups. These come into close ap- proximation, both locally and physically, with the Eastern Negroes of the first division, and Fig. 842. Souakiny Chief,—Eastern Nnbia. {From a portrait given in " Salfs Travels.") with the northern Kaffres of the second. The colour of the Gallas varies from a deep black to have been driven back by the Indo-European immigration, and at last to have been limited to the Basque provinces. For anything yet known to the contrary, the structure of the Hottentot lan- guage may, like their physical conformation, be more closely related to that of the Turanian stock than to the Semitic, with which the languages of Northern Africa are obviously connected.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1357 to a brownish yellow ; their stature is tall ; their bodies spare, wiry, and muscular ; their frontal profile vaulted, their nose straight or even arched, their lips moderately full, their hair often hanging over the neck in long twisted plaits. Nearly the same description applies to some of the Nubian tribes (Jig. 842), of which the resemblance to the Arab physiog- nomy becomes very striking, although their colour is jet-black ; and, [as already shown, there is distinct evidence of their Negro an- cestry. The languages of these Nilotic people present an intermediate gradation between the proper Semitic and the proper African; and all that has been made known by the explora- tions in these regions, which have been carried on, more or less uninterruptedly, ever since the French expedition into Egypt, tends to break down the line of demarcation which was supposed to separate the African nations from all others. To a similar result have tended all those Egyptological researches which have been carried on with so much ardour during the same period. For a careful examination of the delineations of themselves left to us in the paintings and sculptures of the ancient Egyptians, and of the crania preserved in their sepulchres, leaves no reasonable doubt, that in their physiognomy and complexion they were essentially African; although very marked va- rieties in cranial conformation, and in the hue of their surface, appear to have existed amongst them. The Copts, or existing natives of Egypt, seem, on the whole, pretty nearly to represent their physical characters, although in a condi- tion of comparative degradation, owing to the state of subjection to which they have been re- duced ; and although the existing Coptic lan- Fig. 843.

Such were the sovereignties of Morocco, Algiers, and Tunis, which brought the aboriginal tribes under nominal subjection to themselves. guage has been undoubtedly changed from its original form by the successive colonizations and conquests to which the country has been subjected, yet it still shows a marked affinity with the proper African languages in certain peculiarities of its construction. Lastly, the northern and north-western portion of the African continent is occupied by tribes whose Semitic origin is undoubted. Several immigrations appear to have taken place at different times from the Syro-Ara- bian stock ; but that which has most claim to the title of an aboriginal population, is that of which the Berber races (from which the north-west of Africa received the desig- nation of Barbary) may be regarded as the types ; the Kabyles of Algiers and Tunis (the people of Abd-el-Kader), the Tuaryks of Sahara, and the Shelahs or mountaineers of Southern Morocco, being branches of the same stock ; as were also, most probably, the Guanches or ancient population of the Canary Islands. These people all speak dialects of a language, which has been shown by Prof. Newman to be an offset from the Semitic : and whilst the complexion, and even the hair and physiognomy, of those which approach the Negro area, present a remarkable approximation to those characteristic of the Negro, those of the northern and more ele- vated districts retain the Caucasian type, and some of them are quite fair in skin, and Euro- pean in feature. But subsequently to the settlement of these tribes in the regions they still inhabit, there have been colonizations by Phoenicians and true Arabs ; and these immi- grants have for the most part remained distinct from the aboriginal population (figs. 843.844), Fig. 844. its taken under the direction of Prof. 3111 ne-Edwards.) Notwithstanding its Semitic affinities, the language of the North-African aborigines is considered by Dr. Latham as having affinities also with the proper African tongues, and as having been isolated from them without suf-1358 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. ficient reason ; and if this be the case, another link of transition exists, which, with those previously named, brings the two groups into such relations, that their separation cannot be justified. By Dr. Latham, accordingly, the Syro-Arabian or Semitic race is ranked with the African under the general designation Atlantidce. IV. American Nations.—The aboriginal inhabitants of America have been considered by some ethnologists as a department of the human family very distinct from the inhabit- ants of the Old World ; and attempts have been frequently made to define them as a race by physical characters. But these attempts have been founded upon a very imperfect acquaintance with the nations peopling this vast continent; for, taken in the aggregate, they are by no means uniform either in phy- sical qualities, in intellectual endowments, moral character, or grade of civilisational development; nor is the line of distinction between them and the rest of mankind nearly so obvious or strongly marked as is usually imagined. Thus the native Americans have been described as ,; red-men; " but there are tribes equally red, and perhaps more deserv- ing that epithet, in Africa and Polynesia; and the American nations are by no means all of a red or copper hue, some being as fair as many European people, others being brown or yellow, and others nearly, if not quite, as black as the Negroes of Africa. Again, it has been attempted by anatomists to dis- tinguish the American races by a certain con- figuration of skull and form of features ; and Fig. 845. Indian of the Oto tribe, — basin of the Mississippi. {From the " Atlas du Voyage du Prince de Neu- wied") Notwithstanding this diversity in their phy- sical characters, however, there is strong evidence that the American nations constitute one natural family,, bound together by com- munity of descent. This appears from the even Dr. Morton, in his splendid work en- titled " Crania Americana," has given his authority in support of the opinion, that such distinctive characters are to be found " in the squared or rounded head, the flattened and vertical occiput, the high cheek-bones, the ponderous maxillae, the large quadrangular orbits, and the low receding forehead." Nevertheless, even he is obliged to admit that very considerable diversities present them- selves in the cranial conformation of the American nations ; and he altogether ex- cludes the Esquimaux, who, according to the evidence of language, must be regarded as being as truly an American people as any other, in spite of their obvious conformity to the Mongolian type of cranial configuration. And it will be observed that many of the characters just enumerated are those of the Mongolian cranium ; a decided approximation to which may be seen among several tribes, whose dwelling is much further south than that of the Esquimaux. The testimony of travellers who have visited parts of the con- tinent remote from each other, and who have scrutinized with observant eyes the physi- ognomy and form of head, not in individuals only, but in nations, is very decided as to the marked varieties in configuration which pre- sent themselves among these; thus, says that eminent zoologist, M. D'Orbigny, "A Peru- vian is more different from a Patagonian, and a Patagonian from a Guarani, than is a Greek from an Ethiopian or a Mongolian." The ac- companying figures present examples of this diversity {Jigs. 845 and 846). Fig. 846. Soirth American of the Cliarruan tribe. (From a portrait by Werner, in the Museum of Paris.) remarkable relationship which has been dis- covered among their languages ; not, however, in their words or even their roots,but in their grammatical construction. In regard to vo- cabulary, indeed, there are few parts of the1359 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. Fig. 847. South American o f the Puri tribe,— interior of Brazil. {After Rugendas.) globe in which so many dialects, or even dis- tinct languages, are spoken within such limited areas ; and thus, if difference in this respect be considered as a sufficient reason for denying the mutual affinity of the races, the number of separate stocks must be enor- mously multiplied. On the other hand, the mutual relationship just indicated, which con- sists more particularly in the very remarkable agglutination of words or portions of words, has been found in all the American languages which have been carefully examined, including some of the most important dialects spoken in parts of the continent very remote from each other. And it is easily shown that this practice, carried on without any regular sys- tem, but according to the wants and caprices of each detached community, will, in the absence of such a literature as gives fixity to a language, almost necessarily induce such changes, that two offsets of the same stock, developing themselves under different circum- stances, shall cease in a few generations to be mutually intelligible. There are other causes, too, in the character of the people themselves, and in the mode in which they employ lan- guage, which tend to introduce such varia- tions. Their speech is, for the most part, rather an expression of their own ideas and emotions, than a reflex of external things, — much more subjective than objective ; and hence their names for the most familiar objects, or the simplest ideas, are long compound words or epithets, which are in striking contrast with the brief terms employed for the same pur- poses by most other nations. This feature in their phraseology seems common to all the American languages ; and it is strikingly indicative of a fundamental peculiarity in the psychical character of the people, namely, a predominance of the imaginative and rhetorical disposition, over the mere sensuousness which is observable among most nations that have Fig. 848. South American of the Achagua tribe,—basin of the Orinoco. {From a portrait by 31. Roulin.~) attained to a similar grade of material pro- gress. Those, indeed, who are most familiar with the psychical nature of the aborigines of America, have been struck with the manifes- tations they present of greater energy and mental vigour, of a more reflective nature, of greater fortitude, and of more consistent per- severance in their various pursuits and enter- prises, than are to be met with among any of the aboriginal nations of the Old World ; and these peculiarities are in great part due to the intensity of their selfish emotions, which ex- hibits itself in the sullen and unsocial cha- racter, the proud apathetic endurance, the intensity of hatred and revenge, the feeble influence of the benevolent affections, and the deep malice-concealing dissimulation, which are so remarkable in the dwellers amid the dark solitudes of the American forests. Among many of the American nations, moreover, traces have been observed of ancient institu- tions,— complicated forms of government, regulated despotisms or monarchies, privileged orders, hierarchical and sacerdotal ordinances, systematic laws (the result of reflection and a settled purpose) connected with marriage, in- heritance, family relationships, &c. and other customs, — that mark a very early progress in social development, the forms of which are in great degree peculiar to them. Their opinions, moreover, respecting a future state, and the nature and attributes of invisible agents, are strikingly different from those of nations who have never emerged from primi- tive barbarism. They have had in use, more- over, from time immemorial, cultivated plants and domestic animals, different from those of the Old World; and their earliest traditions refer the knowledge of these to some fabulous person, who descended from the gods, or who suddenly made his appear- ance among their ancestors ; thus indicating the remoteness of the era of their separationVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1360 from the inhabitants of the Old World, who have similar mythical legends in regard to the introducers of their first arts and acquire- ments. Abundant evidence is afforded, by architec- tural and other remains still existing, as well as by the accounts of the early Spanish his- torians, of the high degree of civilisation which some of the nations of America had attained, previously to the European immi- gration, especially in the warmer regions of that continent. Thus the natives of Mexico had erected stupendous edifices, which rivalled those of Egypt ; and although they did not attain to the greatest of human inventions,— that of symbols representing the sounds of words, — they had long aspired after it, and had contrived a method of recording events and of handing down to memory the passages of their ancient history. They had even made great advances in science, and had a solar year with intercalations on the principle of the Roman calendar. They were diligent cultivators of the ground, and also expert miners and workers in metals ; even astonish- ing the workmen of Europe with their skill in setting gems. They appear, too, to have been influenced by a deep sentiment of religion, and to have had a very stately and majestic ceremonial. Nevertheless, they do not seem to have derived from these advances in civi- lisation, any moral improvement, or any miti- gation of that sullen malignity which seems to be the general character of the native tribes of the New World ; and their religion was far from having an exalting influence, since their gods had no attribute of clemency or mercy, but were invested with the worst forms of their own dark passions. In Peru, also, we find remains of Cyclopean structures erected during the government of the Incas, which bear comparison with those of ancient Egypt ; and the wonder is increased when it is recollected, that no beast of burden save the llama existed in Peru before the Spanish invasion. At a time when there were no public highways in Britain but such as were relics of Roman greatness, there were roads of 1500 miles in length in the empire of Peru, carried over heights which overtop the Peak of Tenerift'e. The ancient Peruvians were ignorant of the manner of forming an arch ; but they had constructed suspension- bridges over frightful ravines. They had no implements of iron; but they could move blocks of stone as huge as the Sphinxes and Memnons of Egypt. Everything, then, seems to indicate one of two things ; either that the American races are descended from a stock originally distinct from that of any part of the Old World, or that, having had a common origin with the abori- gines of Asia and Europe, they have existed as a separate family of nations from a very early period in the history of the race. This question will be considered hereafter; but it must not here be left unnoticed, that several of the tribes of the Western coast of America present a striking physical resemblance to the Peninsular Mongols ; and that there are in- dications of communication between them, at a comparatively late period.* This brief account of the American races would be incomplete, without a notice of one of their most remarkable customs, — that of altering the form of the skull by artificial compression — which may be traced in dif- ferent parts, both of the northern and southern divisions of the continent. This flattening was vertical in some instances, horizontal in others. Of the former, Dr. Morton figures examples, in his " Crania Americana," from the tribe of Natchez Indians (which appears to have been a branch of the Toltecan family) that was exterminated by the French in the year 1730. The compression was effected by means of a bag of sand placed upon the fore- head, whilst the occiput lay upon a sort of mould, of which it gradually took the form under the slow but constant influence of this pressure. Some curious bas-reliefs, executed by the Toltecans during their sojourn in Mexico, show that the practice prevailed amongst the most civilised portion of that race. The horizontal flattening is practised at the present time by the Chinooks and other tribes inhabiting the neighbourhood of the Columbia river; the mode in which it is ac- complished varying considerably in the differ- ent tribes, but the general effect being the same. So highly is this deformity valued by them, that their slaves are not allowed to practise it; and yet the process by which it is induced often gives rise to ulceration of the scalp, and not unfrequently to death. In one of the skulls figured by Dr. Morton, the ver- tical diameter is reduced to little more than four inches, the top of the cranium presents a flattened arch not far removed from a hori- zontal plane, and the face is protruded until the facial angle is reduced to 60°, probably the lowest grade ever observed in a human skull; the compression has also destroyed in a re- markable degree the lateral symmetry. Yet the capacity of the cranium is not altered by the process ; and the " flat-head " Indians are certainly not deficient in any of the mental qualities of their race. Both kinds of flatten- ing appear to have been practised by the ancient Peruvians ; in whose sepulchres are found vast numbers of crania, presenting such different degrees of departure from what seems to have been the normal form, that it is not easy to find one which can be positively affirmed to be unaltered. A characteristic example of the effect produced by the process of horizontal flattening is given in jigs. 8±9, 850, 851 ; which represents a skull closely resembling that of a flat-head Indian of the Columbia river. It seems not improbable that the horizontal flattening was prac- tised anteriorly to the advent of the Incas, which may be dated at about the year 1100; and that the vertical flattening was introduced by them. It seems to have been * See Humboldt's " Views of Nature" (Bohn's edition), pp. 131—133.VARIETIES OF MANKIND. i.361 Fig. 84-9. Artificially-compressed Cranium from Titicaca. (From a specimen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.) continued among the Peruvians for some time after their conquest by the Spaniards ; for the Ecclesiastical Court of Lima passed a decree in the year 1585, forbidding parents, under certain specified penalties, to compress or distort the heads of their children in the various modes which were then in vogue. The practice still exists among certain tribes of South American Indians ; and seems to be regarded in much the same light with the artificial compression of the foot by the Chinese, or of the waist by the French and English,—namely, as an artificial develop- ment of a natural beauty. V. Oceanic Nations. — The vast Oceanic area, extending in longitude from Madagascar on the one side, to Easter Island (half way be- tween Asia and America) on the other; and in latitude from Formosa to New Zealand, includ- ing the numerous islands of the Indian and Polynesian archipelagoes, and the great island- continent of Australia, is peopled by tribes the greater part of which are undoubtedly related to each other very intimately, and have no near affinities with those of any other region. The only part of the mainland of Asia which is in- habited by an Oceanic tribe, is the Peninsula of Malacca ; and there is far more reason to think that this tribe has migrated to that locality from the neighbouring part of Oceania, than that it represents the original stock and line of migration of the Oceanic races. In the physical characters of the Oceanic tribes, two typical varieties present themselves ; and these may be designated as the Malayo-Polynesian, and the Negrito, The Malayo-Polynesians present a nearer approach to the Mongolian type than to any other ; but they must be compared rather with the modified Mongols of the south-east por- tion of the Asiatic continent, than with the proper Turanian stock. Their complexion is yellow, olive, brunette, or brown, rarely or never darkening into black ; their hair, often long, is usually black and straight ; the face is usually somewhat flat, the cheek-bones high, and the antero-posterior diameter of the skull short; but there is often a tendency to the VOL. IV. prognathous character, such as is shown among the inferior Hindoos. This division of the Oceanic races occupies the greater part of the Indian Archipelago, and the whole of the Polynesian ; but it does not exist in New Guinea, Australia, Tasmania, New Ireland, or the islands between it and New Caledonia, which are peopled exclusively by Negritos. That the tribes thus widely dispersed are all descendants of one and the same stock, and belong to the same race, seems distinctly proved by the affinities of their languages ; which, although presenting considerable modi- fications (as might be naturally expected from a prolonged isolation, and from the entire ab- sence of a literature), yet accord, as has been proved by William Humboldt, in many of their primary words, and in their general plan of construction. This mutual relationship is the closest among the Malayan dialects of the Indian Archipelago on the one hand, and among the tongues spoken by the various Poly- nesian islanders on the other; but these two groups are also undoubtedly related to one another, in such a manner as to constitute but one family of languages.—The proper Malays are, for the most part, a people of short and slender stature, and small limbs, but well- formed and vigorous; they have flat faces, somewhat oblique eyes, and features resem- bling the Chinese; the hue of their com- plexion, however, is considerably deeper, but is not so dark as that of the Hindoos, yellow being still a large ingredient. These cha- racters, however, are far from being uniformly exhibited by the whole Malayan branch ; and in particular it is to be remarked that a ten- dency to the prognathous type occasionally shows itself, as in the skull of a Bugis of Celebes, described by Blumenbach.—Between the Malayan and the proper Polynesian area is a small group, including the Pelew, Caroline, and Marianne islands, the inhabitants of which are even more conformable to the Mongolian type than are either the true Malays or the proper Polynesians ; these are termed by Dr. Prichard, Micronesians. A consideration of the probable lines of that migration which 4 sVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 362 must be admitted to have taken place, unless every island is supposed to have had its own independent stock, has led Dr. Latham to the conclusion that the Micronesian group was peopled before the Polynesian area. — The proper Polynesian branch presents such a wide diversity in physical characters, that if it were not for the unquestionable community of lan- guage, usages, &c, it might be thought to con- sist of several races, as distinct from each other as they are from the Malayan branch. Thus the Tahitians and Marquesans are tall and well made; their figures combine grace and vigour ; the skulls are usually as symmetrical as those of most Europeans ; and their physiog- nomy presents much of the European cast, there being only a slight flattening of the nose, expansion of the nostrils, and thick- ening of the lips, to indicate a degradation, which is rather in the Negro than in the Mongolian directio:i (fig. 850.). The cora- Fis. 850. plexion, especially in the females of the higher classes, who are sheltered from the wind and sun, is of a clear olive, or brunette, such as is common among the natives of Southern Eu- rope ; and the hair, though generally black, is sometimes brown or auburn, or even red or flaxen. Among other tribes, as the Sandwich Islanders, the New Zealanders, and the Tonga and Friendly islanders, there are greater di- versities of hue and conformation (fig. 851.); some being of a copper-brown colour; others, nearly black; others, olive ; and others, almost white ; the fairer races are generally taller and more vigorous, whilst the darker are inferior in stature and figure. Many of these varieties present themselves in a single community, Fig. 851. New Zealander. (From a portrait by Eurle.~) such as that of New Zealand, and are so strongly marked as to have led to the idea that the difference is due to an intermixture of races; but the unity of language, and the ab- sence of any other indication, prevent such a supposition from possessing the least claim to reception. It is a most remarkable fact that the Madccassians, or natives of Madagascar, speak a language which is obviously derived from the Malayan stock, being most nearly allied to that of the Philippine Islands ; and some of the multiform population of that island bear a striking resemblance to Malays, whilst others seem more allied (as might be expected) to the African nations of the main- land. At present, the character and origin of the Madecassian population is one of the doubtful questions of ethnology. The Negrito race presents a marked ap- proximation to the physical characters of the true Negro. The skull is of the prognathous type ; the nose is flattened, the nostrils ex- panded laterally, the lips thickened, and the complexion a deep brown, or even black. The character of the hair varies considerably ; for in some cases it is long and straight ( fig. 827.); and in others, crisp and frizzly ; and in others, even woolly (figs.HQo, 806.). By Dr. Prichard and others a distinction was drawn between those with straight, and those with woolly hair; but the validity of this can scarcely be maintained, since it appears that the very same people may present one or the other kind of hair, according, as it would seem, to the climatic and other conditions under which they exist. The Negrito race not only inhabits the area which is more exclusively its own, but is also believed to exist inVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1363 4 s 2 the interior of many of the larger islands of the Indian Archipelago ; it is not always cer- tain, however, whether the people whose pre- sence there is reported, are Negritoes or dark Fig. 852. Portrait of Ourou-Mare, an Australian Chief. (From the " Atlas da Voyage au Terres Australes."") Malays. There are many indications, indeed that the Malayo-Polynesian and Negrito races are not really so distinct, as the marked dis- similarity of their respective physical types, and the complete want of conformity between their languages, would make it appear. For as, on the one hand, some of the subdivisions of the former present a decided tendency to- wards the prognathous character, and the depth of complexion, which are typical of the latter, so among the latter we do find a lighter shade of skin, a greater symmetry of skull, and a considerable improvement in form and fea- ture, not unfrequently displaying themselves ; as is the case, for example, with some of the Papuans, or inhabitants of New Guinea, and even occasionally with the Australian abori- gines, notwithstanding that the physiognomy of the latter generally exhibits a very manifest degradation (Jig. 852.) The relations of the language of the different branches of this race to each other, and to other languages, have not yet been clearly developed. They appear, however, to possess a general community of structure, with differences in the vocabulary; and such differences present themselves very prominently among some of the languages of Australian tribes, whose common origin can- not be questioned. According to Dr. Latham, they contain a considerable infusion of Malay words ; but this is scarcely enough to establish their community of origin with the languages of the Malayo-Polynesian stock. Some other affinities have been pointed out by Dr. Prich- ard ; but these, it is remarkable, are not so intimate as those which subsist between the Australian and the Tamulian of Southern India. Remote as the connection seems, this circumstance adds weight to the idea, that the native Australians are an offset from that southern branch of the great nomadic stock of Central Asia, which seems early to have spread itself through the Indian and Indo- Chinese peninsula. It is commonly believed that there is no people, excepting the most degraded of the Negroes and the Bushmen of the Cape, whose physical condition is so miserable, or whose mental development is so low, as that of the Australian aborigines ; but the testimony of those who have visited them in their native haunts, where as yet they have been uncontaminated by contact with Europeans, and have not suffered from the deprivation of the land which affords them the means of subsistence, is very decided i i regard to the exaggeration which has prevailed on this point. In particular it may be re- marked, that, although they have less suscepti- bility than exists among many other rude nations to religious impressions, yet it is cer- tain that they are not destitute (as some have represented them to be) of all idea of a God ; they even seem to have a notion of a future state, and a belief in good and evil angels. They have likewise a superstitious belief in magicians or sorcerers ; a belief which seems to attain its highest point among the nations of High Asia. Many complex and singular institutions, especially relating to the tenure of property, exist among them ; to which the nearest approach elsewhere is presented by the North American Indians. Looking, then, to the great diversity which exists among the subordinate groups of which both these divisions consist, and their ten- dency to mutual approximation, it cannot be shown that any sufficient reason exists for isolating them from each other ; and, as already remarked, there seems no medium between the supposition that each island had its aboriginal py.ir or pairs, and the doctrine that the whole of Oceania has been peopled from a common stock. Looking, again, to the very marked approximation which is presented by certain Oceanic tribes to the Mongolian type, and this in a locality which, on other grounds, might be regarded as having received the first stream of migration, the possibility, to say the least, can scarcely be denied, that the main-land furnished the original stock, which has under- gone various transformations subsequently to its first dispersion ; these having been the re- sult of climatic influence and mode of life, and having been chiefly influenced as to degree, by the length of time during which the transform- ing causes have been in operation. At any rate it may be safely affirmed, that there is no physical peculiarity which entitles the Oceanic races to rank as a group, which must have ne- cessarily had an original stock distinct from that of the continental nations. General Recapitulation. On the whole then, the result of the ex- tensive range of inquiries, of w hich an out-VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 136-1 line has now been given, may be stated as follows : — 1. The extremest differences from each other, or from a common stock, presented by the races of Mankind, in regard alike to physical, physiological, and psychological peculiarities, are not greater in degree than those which are known to arise amongst other species of animals possessed of a similar adaptive capacity, under the influence of changes in external con- ditions ; and they differ only in degree, not in kind, from those of whose origin in a change of external conditions, in the case of mankind, we have adequate evidence. 2. In whatever mode the types of the prin- cipal varieties are selected, they are found to be connected by intermediate or transitional gradations ; the descendants of each principal stock exhibiting, in a greater or less degree, a capability of approximation to the characters of others. 3. There is nothing in these diversities, therefore, to justify the erection of specific distinctions among the different races of Man- kind ; and, whilst a probability of the unity of their original stock may consequently be said to exist, all scientific evidence points to the conclusion, that, if the original stocks were multiple, they must have had attributes es- sentially the same. 4. The supposition of a number of distinct " protoplasts," one for each principal region of the globe, is not required to account for the extension of the human family over its area, and it does not afford any assistance in ac- counting for the phenomena of their existing distribution; since each principal geogra- phical area contains races of very diversified physical characters, the affinity of whose lan- guages makes it next to certain that they must have had a common descent. 5. The evidence of philological research decidedly tends to the conclusion, that such affinities exist between the earliest known stocks of the principal groups of languages now and heretofore in use, as can only be reasonably accounted for on the hypothesis of their common origin, and the consequent ra- diation of the whole species from one centre. What that centre is likely to have been, is a legitimate object of inquiry ; and the follow- ing, which have long been regarded by the author as the most probable deductions from modern Ethnographical research in relation to this subject, are now submitted with additional confidence, on account of the confirmation which they have received from the most recent investigations, and, in particular, from their conformity with the arrangement which Dr. Latham's linguistic researches have led him to adopt. The stock from which the globe was ori- ginally peopled, is probably more nearly repre- sented at this time by the Turanians of High Asia than by any other; and soaie part of that region was probably their primary seat. It is among the Mongols and their allies, that that combination of physical attributes which is best adapted to the exigencies of a nomadic life, and that constitution which renders a nomadic life a necessity of their nature, most characteristically present themselves. The bodily system of these people possesses a vigour and adaptiveness, which enables it to flourish under all the diversities of climate to which their wandering propensities conduct them ; and they can accommodate their mode of life, without any great departure from their characteristic nomadism, to a great variety of external circumstances. Moreover, the geo- graphical relations of High Asia make it the most central spot on the whole globe, for the radiation of Man to every corner of the ha- bitable world; its connections with all other lands are such as are possessed by no other region ; while its climate is so intermediate between that of the frigid and that of the torrid zones, that the passage into either is without any violent transition ; and, as a matter of fact, we find that, while the Tungu- sians and Ugrians have carried the Turanian stock to the shores of the Polar Sea, a Tartar tribe has made itself master of China, and governs the whole of the south-east of Asia, even to the Indian Ocean. This a priori ar- gument, however, would be worth very little, if we did not find it in correspondence with the very curious fact, that the most ancient inhabitants of nearly every part of the globe are connected with the nations of High Asia, more or less closely, by affinity of language or of physical characters. This we have seen to be the case, not merely with the Seriform stock of Southern Asia and the Hyperborean and Peninsular Mongols of the north and north-east, but also with the aboriginal people of Northern and Southern Europe, with those of the Caucasus, and with the first settlers of the Indian Archipelago. Not less complete is the transition to the American nations; for whilst, on the one hand, the Esquimaux forms the link of connection, agreeing in physical character with the Hyperborean Mongols, and in language with the mass of the proper Ame- rican nations, increased acquaintance with the languages of the latter, and with the languages of the Northern Asiatics, has confirmed the suggestion long since made, that they are con- structed upon a plan essentially the same; the tendency to agglutination, which is less manifested in the more immediate descendants of the parent-stock, beina: most fully carried out in its offsets, the Euskarian of the Basque provinces, the languages of the Peninsular Mongolidae, and the American tongues. The only region regarding which there is not the same amount of evidence, is Africa. But we have seen reason to regard the whole group of African nations as connected, through the Semitic stock, with the Asiatic races ; and all the knowledge recently acquired of the lan- guage of Ancient Egypt*, together with all the information gained by Major Rawlinson and * See the memoir by the Chevalier Bunsen, " On the results of the recent Egyptian Researches in reference to Asiatic and African Ethnology, and the Classification of Languages," in the Reports of the British Association for 1847.1365 VARIETIES OF MANKIND. 4 s 3 other decipherers of the most ancient inscrip- tions in the south-west of Asia, tends towards the conclusion, that the languages of the Afri- can nations are derived from the same funda- mental stock with those of the Arian and Turanian, the separation having taken place when they were as jet in that early stage of development, which has remained stereotyped (so to speak) in the Chinese and other Seri- f'orm tongues. Looking at the African popu- lation under this aspect, we may fairly imagine it to have been first derived from immigrants by no means remote from the Turanian stock ; these gradually spreading themselves over the entire continent, became gradually modified in their physical characters by the new cir- cumstances in which they found themselves; and whilst the dwellers in the Nile valley ad- vanced in civilization and in intellectual de- velopment, and became assimilated in cranial characters to the other races surrounding the Mediterranean sea, those of Central, Western, and Southern Africa underwent a degradation into the prognathous type, similar to that which has affected the earlier settlers in Oce- ania, and to which some approach is seen in Southern India. Viewed under this aspect, the re-appearance of the Mongolian type of conformation among the Hottentots of South- ern Africa is extremely significant; for, al- though they are Africans by immediate de- scent, yet the characters of their remoter ancestry reappear, so soon as a correspondence in physical conditions favours their repro- duction. In certain spots of the globe thus peopled with races derived from a common centre, varieties in physical conformation appear to have sprung up, which, in a scanty and scat- tered population, would have a far greater tendency to perpetuation than is now any- where exhibited (see p. 1312) ; new and more refined languages were originated ; local de- velopments of higher forms of civilization oc- curred ; and subordinate centres were thus formed, from which more limited radiations have subsequently taken place, impressing their own features of civilization upon the countries through which they have spread. Thus we have, at a very early period, indi- cations of the Egyptian, the Syro-Arabian, the Arian, the Indo-Chinese, the Mexican, and the Peruvian races, preserved to us in their architectural remains, or in their written records ; and although some of these may possibly have been mutually connected at their origin, yet they seem to have been very early separated, and to have attained their fullest development independently of each other. The subsequent migrations of certain of these races, or of offsets from them, have en- tirely changed their original distribution. The Arab race has extended itself through North- ern and even Central Africa, over Southern Asia, and even into the Indian Archipelago. But the Arian has displaced the aboriginal population from almost every part of Europe, and has there formed a secondary centre of radiation, whilst its original stock has been almost obliterated. It is obviously a stock which attains its fullest development under the influence of a moderate temperature ; and oidj', therefore, when it exchanged its original seat for the more favourable influences of European climate, did it manifest its remark- able capabilities. It can scarcely be doubted that from this race, or from a mixed race de- veloped between it and their aboriginal popu- lations, America and Oceania are destined to be re-peopled ; the destiny of Asia and Africa, however, seems more obscure. In the former country, the primitive races possess a con- siderable amount of self-sustaining vigour ; and in the latter, they exhibit an adaptiveness to its peculiarities of climate, which will perhaps never be acquired by Europeans. Moreover, whilst the American and Oceanic races appear doomed to extinction as pure races, wherever they come into contact with Europeans, there is no evidence that such is the case with those of Mongolian or of African descent; the latter, indeed, hold their ground with remarkable tenacity, and we may not improbably regard them as destined, under the influence of Chris- tian civilization, to bear an important part in the future history of Mankind. (Seep. 1344.) Addendum.—[Since the former part of this article has been in print, the statements of Count Strzelecki, cited in p. 1341, have been pointedly contradicted, as regards the abo- riginal females of Australia, by Dr. T. R. H. Thompson (surgeon, R.N.), who states as the result of personal inquiries among several different tribes, that for a native female to bear children to a native male, after having borne half-caste children to an European father, is by no means an uncommon occurrence. He admits that wherever European settlers are commingled with the aborigines in Australia, the native race disappears. This however, he maintains, does not arise from "any deviation of nature's laws ;" but because the European, wherever he takes with him his civilization, takes with him his vices also; so that drunken- ness and syphilitic diseases, which soon be- come rife among the neighbouring population, speedily cause their decline. Dr. Brown allows that the diminution is partly caused by the comparative infecundity of the females who have cohabited with Europeans ; but he ac- counts for this by attributing it to the change of life to which she is subjected. " From living in a state of nature, with irre- gular and uncertain diet, exposed to every vicissitude of climate, with no other protection than a few kangaroo skins, or a roll of bark, or of the 'tulka,' she enters on a more regular life, partakes of regular meals, and sleeps no longer exposed. But even with this a'teration for the better, she does not bear to the white man more prolifically than to her native hus- band ; on the contrary, her fecundity appears to decrease,— for, on partaking of the white man's comforts, she is a recipient of his vices; she passes much of her time in a half inebriatedVARIETIES OF MANKIND. 1366 state, smoking tobacco and drinkinjr ardent spirits whenever they can be procured. In- deed, it is well known, that among the chief inducements for the native female to remain with a European, are the rum and tobacco with which she is supplied ad libitum. Can we then wonder, if, after some years spent in a manner which must militate against her capabilities for procreating, more than her previous rude mode of life, she returns to her tribe with a broken constitution, and probably past the usual term of life for conception (they seldom bear children after thirty years of age) to prove in such instances sterile?"* The same explanation is probably appli- cable to the case of the other Aboriginal races adverted to by Count Strzelecki; and, if it be the correct representation of facts, it altogether destroys the force of any argument which might be raised upon the infertility of the native females after having borne children to Europeans, in favour of the specific differ- ence of the races.] Bibliography.— For the facts of the latter part of this article, the author has relied in great part on the learned and elaborate treatises of Dr. Prichard, whose " Researches into the Physical History of Mankind" (3rd edit, London, 1836-1847), will long hold its rank as a most complete and masterly treatise on Ethnology. His smaller work, " The Natural History of Man" (London, 1848), though chiefly an abridgement of the preceding, contains in its supplement some additional information of value. The author has also derived much assistance from Dr. Latham's more recent treatise, " Natural History of the Varieties of Man," (London, 1850). A large part of the materials of the earlier portion of the article, however, have been drawn direct from original sources. The Bibliography of the subject, to be complete, must include a most extensive catalogue, not only of special treatises in various departments of Eth- nology, but also of Voyages and Travels, and of Philological works and memoirs.

VEIN (Wij/, Gr.; Vena, Lat.; Vcinc, Fr ; B/utader,Ger.; Vena, Ital.; Vena, Span.). — In general anatomy the term vein, in the higher animals, includes four sets of blood-vessels, differing in so many respects from each other as to renderit difficult to give a general defini- tion which shall include all under one head, either as it regards structure, course, or func- tion : indeed, so unlike are the different sys- tems of veins, that the only remark which can be said to apply to them all is, that they convey blood in a direction towards the heart ; in this respect, as well as in their want of uniformity of character, being directly opposed to the arteries. The four systems of veins are the systemic, the portal, the pulmonary, and certain veins peculiar to foetal life — the ductus venosus and umbilical vein ; and it will be found, upon contrasting them, that they differ much from each other, considering that all enjoy the common appellation vein. Thus, the systemic veins, which correspond to the branches of the aorta, excepting those of the abdominal viscera, collect the blood from small and nu- merous vessels into larger and fewer in its progress towards the heart, constituting a course of circulation of a truly venous cha- racter ; while, on the other hand, that portion of the blood, which is conveyed to the ab- dominal viscera by the branches of the ab- dominal aorta, is first collected from numerous branches into one vessel — the vena porta — thus far the circulation being venous, and is then again broken up into smaller and re* dividing vessels, after the manner of ar- teries, and forming, as regards this particular, an arterial circulation, though the vessels are nevertheless veins. In both these in- stances the blood conveyed by the vessels in question has a similar quality, which is characteristic of veins, and is called venous; it is blood saturated with carbon. In the two other systems of venous circulation — the pulmonary and umbilical — the current is venous while the fluid is arterial, these vessels being channels by which the blood is returned to the heart after it has left the arterialising organs. Again, as regards the structure and calibre of veins, our definition is necessarily loose; for, while veins are, in a general way, thin, less elastic, and distensible, as contrasted with arteries, they are nevertheless very varied in these particulars in different regions, and though, for the most part, the calibre of veins is greater than that of the corresponding arteries, stdl this is not always the case, as is found upon contrasting the area of sections of the pulmonary arteries and veins. It is there- fore imj ossible to give a succinct, and, at the same time, a comprehensive definition of vein ; and the one which appears to me to be most applicable and to include the members of each venous system is this — that a vein is a blood-vessel, neither artery nor capillary, convey- ing blood in a direction towards the heart, having walls of greater tenuity and extensibility and, at the same time, less elasticity than an artery. The literary history of this subject is chiefly interesting as referring to veins, in their rela- tion to the general circulation. Until the time of Harvey's great discovery, the general physiological relationship of the veins was not understood, and the most discrepant notions were entertained. Hippocrates, in none of his writings, draws distinction between arteries and veins. Plato, in his Timseus, describes the veins as con- nected with the heart, and receiving blood from it. He regards the veins as the messen- gers, transmitting to the whole body the orders coming from the soul : he attributes to them the functions of sentient and motor nerves. He considers that the veins have two centres — the heart and the liver ; and he makes no distinction between them and arteries. Prota- goras taught that the veins were blood-vessels, in contradistinction to the arteries which he considered air-vessels. Aristotle drew no distinction between arteries and veins. Hcro- philus describes both arteries and veins as blood-vessels: but he expresses himself in doubt, as to whether the veins arise from the heart or the liver. Erasistraius, holding the same general doctrines as Praxagoras, further described the texture of veins very minutely, and, according to Marx, he noticed the ex- istence of valves. Celsus and Aretasus made no advance in this subject. Galen distin- guished between arteries and veins — both blood-vessels : he also observed the anasto- moses of each : he stated the origin of veins to be from the liver, and of the arteries from the heart, and that both were destitute of sensa- tion. Avicenna described the veins " venas quietae," in contradistinction to the arteries, which he styled " venae pulsantes et audaces." According to Baulinus, Avicenna described the valves of veins under the name of "cel- lules." The European anatomists of the loth, lGtli and the early part of the 17th century, re- mained in a state of great confusion and ig-VEIN. 1368 norance, as to the bearing of the veins upon the circulating system. Vesalius endeavoured to establish the doctrine, that the vena cava takes its origin from the heart, and not the liver; but in this he was opposed by Sylvius, Columbus, Eustachius, and Fallopius. While Ccesalpinus had occasional faint glim- merings of the physiology of the veins, and Fabricius, a remarkable knowledge of their anatomy, it was still left to Harvey to indi- cate their function and relation to the general circulation.* Veins are the necessary companions of arteries, and are consequently found in all animals possessing the latter vessels. In the following remarks I shall, for the purpose of examining the subject more com- pletely, divide the consideration of vein into these heads: — I. Structure. II. Physical and vital properties. III. Origin, course, anastomoses, plexuses, &c. IV. Function. V. Development. My observations will be principally con- fined to the consideration of these various heads as applied to the veins of mammalia, especially the human subject. The general anatomy of this subject in invertebrate classes has not, as yet, been sufficiently examined, and does not appear to furnish many points for generalisation beyond those supplied in the mere anatomical description given of the venous system in the several invertebrate classes, in the articles specially applied to them. I. Structure.—There is scarcely any sub- ject in structural anatomy, which has given rise to so many varied and discrepant opinions, and so much contradictory description as the structure of veins ; the different writers upon this point having been numerous, and with scarcely any exception, each giving an ac- count in some, and often important, respects, contrary to those who have preceded him. This circumstance may, to a certain extent, be explained by the various observers having ex- amined different veins, in different regions, and in different animals ; and it must be remem- bered that all microscopical observations necessarily differ from those which are made with the scalpel and the naked eye, and are incompatible unless conjoined, compared and interpreted by the same individual; for, as we shall presently find, structures which seem reduced by dissection to their simplest ele- ments, are found, when submitted to the mi- croscope, to be compound ; this is especially the case as it regards the internal tunic of veins, as displayed by coarse anatomy and the microscope respectively. All the discrepancies, however, which have occurred cannot be settled upon these grounds, and it must be * For more elaborate details of literary history, I would refer the reader to the article Circulation, and to the learned " Diatribe Anatomico-physio- logica de struotura et vita venarum," by Marx. See Bibliography. granted that in some instances the writers upon this subject have rather drawn upon their imagination than depended entirely upon anatomical demonstration. These conflicting statements, however, serve to keep be'bre us the fact that there is considerable difference of structure in veins in certain regions. The early anatomists who devoted their at- tention to the investigation of the intimate structure of organs, applied themselves to the study of the minute texture of veins, and it was indeed one point in their structure which was greatly instrumental in leading Harvey in his discoveries of the circulation. Constantinus first described the structure of veins as consisting of a " tunica villosa." Ve- salius speaks of the membranous character of veins, and of their being composed of three sets of fibres, — a longitudinal, a circular, and an oblique. Fallopius and Bartholini deny the fibrous nature of the coats of veins, and Diemebroec/c described veins as consisting of one membranous tunic, and believes the state- ment of the existence of three tunics to be mere imagination. Willis, Nicolai, and Blan- card describe veins as being composed of four coats or tunics. Haller denies the existence of transverse muscular fibres in the coats of veins, which had been repeatedly mentioned by other anatomists. Lieutaud states that the veins are identical in structure with the ar- teries, but simply attenuated. Prochaska does not admit the existence of a fibrous tunic in veins, whilst Scemmerring says it is to be found only in the larger ones. Aleckel, Autenrith, and Bichat deny altogether the circular or transverse coat of veins, and Senac says that their tunics are composed simply of longitu- dinal fibres. To these might be added a long list of di- verse descriptions, which are however of more literary curiosity than anatomical value. Veins, in the human subject and mammalia, and I believe in vertebrata generally, are membranous cylinders, consisting of various fibrous coats, lined internally by an epithelium. The walls of veins, which are sufficiently thick to admit of coarse dissection, are with care divisible b}' the scalpel into three layers, an internal, middle, and external coat : but, when submitted to microscopical scrutiny, a still further analysis is made; the internal layer is found to have a compound character, and the direction of the elementary fibres of the several tunics is also shown ; the internal and external coats are seen to be longitudinal, while the middle is compound, partly circular and partly longitudinal. The relation of coarse and microscopical ana- tomy will be best seen by the following table: Coarse Dissection. Microscopical Examination. f Epithelium. Internal coat \ Fenestrated membrane.

This may be taken as a tabular view of the typical structure of veins of larger size, and in the smaller vessels the same order of parts is represented, but with less distinctness and greater tenuity. There are certain regions, however, where the venous texture, both in quality and order, departs considerably from the typical arrangement: these will be noticed hereafter. In the following observations, the several coats of the veins will be described in succes- sion, beginning with the innermost. Epithelium. — It is difficult (as has been ob- served by Henle),in all cases, to make out a dis- tinct epithelial layer lining the vascular cavity; but, as far as my observations go, it is more constant in arteries than in veins, and the epithelium is more perfectly formed in the former than in the latter. The anatomist will frequently make search in vain for epithelium on the inner surface of veins, and, when found, a perfect epithelial cell is less common than one imperfectly formed, the nucleus existing, but the cell-wall either partially or wholly absent. Fig. 853. Epithelium from the Vena Cava of a Sheep. a, perfect epithelium; b, common form; c, epithe- lium seen edgewise ; d, nuclei of epithelium desti- tute of cell-wall. (Magnified 200 diameters.) The best method for examining the epithe- lium is by scraping the inner surface of the vessel, and placing the material removed on a slip of glass; or by viewing the free edge of a valve under the microscope. Existing in its most perfect form the epithelium is of a dia- mond or rhomboidal figure, containing a nucleus, large in proportion to the cell, of a pranulai character, and lenticular or oval form. The nucleus is distinct and well defined. The cell itself is clear, pale, ami watery to an ex- tent that it is impossible to portray in a wood- cut. Henle states that the longaxis of the rhom- boid corresponds with that of the vessel in which it exists. In the figure (fig.853.a\ is re- presented the most perfectly formed specimen I have seen from a vein ; the rhomboidal figure being very marked: it was obtained from the vena cava of a sheep. There is also seen {Jig. 853. b), a more common form, where the cell and nucleus are both present, but the structure is less regular and more confused. The epithelium is of the pavement or scaly form, existing in a single layer : the cells are flat, and either have no cavity, the opposed sides being adherent, or the cavity is very minute. This is displayed in the drawing {Jig. 853. c), where some cells are seen edge- wise : in this position the dimensions of the nucleus are observed to bulge out the cell- walls where it is placed, while the cell itself forms a comparatively narrow line, or is even reduced in appearance to a mere linear fila- ment attached to the nucleus, sometimes at one extremity and sometimes at both. But the condition in which I have most commonly found the epithelium is that re- presented at d in the accompanying figure ; the nucleus, the essential part of the cell, being apparently all that is present, and re- presenting the whole epithelial structure. These lenticular corpuscles, the nuclei, are scattered on the inner surface of the vein in pretty much the same position and form as if the cells were present, but the cell-walls are not sketched out, or the nuclei are only here and there partially invested by a cell. This appearance 1 have observed in the freshest specimens, and it may also be produced by keeping those where the cell is distinct for a short time, when the cell-wall liquefies, and becomes invisible. From the fact that the nuclei are in some instances pretty equally separated from each other, and hold about the same relative distances, whether the cell-wall be present or not, it would seem not impro- bable that, where not visible, the cell might still exist in a state of imperfect and indistinct formation, — that the blastema may be present in a mucilaginous condition, but of sufficient density to retain the nuclei in their proper relative position. The nuclei may sometimes be seen thus arranged on the surface of a valve near its clear, thin edge, as is seen with unusual distinctness in Jig. 865. a. These appear- ances are generally destroyed by manipulation. When a valve is placed for examination, the nuclei are apt to float off' its surface in the fluid with which the object is moistened, and arrange themselves along the free margin of the valve in the interval between its edge and the glasses. Henle has represented, in his matchless work on general anatomy, the edge of a valve magnified, in which the nuclei of epithelium are arranged on a clear area, which rims the margin of the valve; and this transparent, structureless boundary he describes as the epithelial cells, in which the nuclei, also visible, are embedded. I have seen well de- veloped epithelium at the edge of a valve, but it did not present the appearance depicted by Henle, the cell being a mere line as repre- sented in j7g.86o. a. a, and scarcely forming a transparent edge. I have also occasionally seen a structureless rim to a valve, and as that was not changed by the washing and brushing off of the superimposed epithelium,1370 VEIN. I have given it a different interpretation: I have indeed considered it as a reduplication of the fenestrated membrane, existing there in a state of great tenuity and destitute of fibrous striations. From the vena cava of the human subject I have obtained epithelium, differing far from the normal form. The specimen consisted of flat, irregular cells, with a small bright nucleus ; some cells distinct, others pale and ill defined ; some densely granular, others scarcely so at all. In Birds (Loon — Colymhw septentiionalis), I have seen the epithelium diamond-shaped, with a large, flat, bright nucleus. In Batraehia (Frog — Bona temporaria), the epithelium was large, pale, and irregular. In Fish (Cod — Gadus morrkua) the epi- thelium was large, irregular, and granular. Fenestrated membrane. — This structure, which Henle has called the " fenestrated," or " striated " membrane, is placed intermediately between the epithelium and the fibro-vascular elements of the vessels' walls, and, from this circumstance, as well as its physical proper- ties, it bears a strong resemblance to the basement or limitary membranes on the skin, the serous and mucous surfaces. This structure has been described and figured by Henle, in a manner which exactly coincides with my own observations. When a portion of the membrane is stripped off the inner surface of a vein (or artery, for it is the same in either), and examined under the microscope, it is found to consist of a thin, continuous sheet, of a pellucid, structureless membrane, to which are adherent some re- ticulated fibres, having a longitudinal direc- tion — hence it is " striated." It is also fre- quently perforated with small holes, from which circumstance it is called " fenestrated." This homogeneous membrane has the remark- able property of rolling itself up in the form of a scroll, somewhat like the elastic laminae of the cornea. According to Henle, it rolls itself in the longitudinal direction, but I have found the same tendency in the opposite course. The apertures, or fenestras, seen on the membrane, all have more or less of a cir- cular or oval form, and I have found that the number and extent of these perforations de- pend on the manipulation it has undergone. Its physical properties are peculiar ; it is crisp and somewhat elastic, and its inclination to roll up in a scroll is so great, that it is never seen in a flat form. The elasticity, which it pos- sesses, is the reason, as it seems to me, why the fenestras are universally of a rounded form ; for when any lesion is effected in it, retraction occurs all round from the injury, and thus makes the point or tine of lesion the axis of a circular or oval aperture, as the case may be. In several specimens of this tissue, in which no fenestras at first existed, I have produced them to any extent by pricking or lacerating it with needles. The fenestras in the figure were thus produced. The longitudinal striations appear to me to be some fibres of the next tunic, — the in- ternal longitudinal fibrous coat — accidentally adherent to the homogeneous membrane.* Fig. 854. septcntrionalis). a, Fenestra. (Magnified about 100 diameters.) In the accompanying drawing (fig. 854.) is represented a portion of this membrane, from the jugular vein of the red-throated diver (Colymbus septentrionalis). It was of a pale pink tint, from contact with the blood in the vessel, and, seen by transmitted light in the mi- croscope, had a slight yellow cast. It was marked by fine longitudinal threads on one surface, which projected at some spots beyond the torn edge of the membrane. Purkinje and Rauschel consider this mem- brane as similar to the middle coat of arteries. Valentin describes it as a peculiar structure- less membrane. Henle considers it as a tran- sition from epithelium to fibrous tissue, in which opinion he is supported by Schwann. The fenestrated membrane has been found on various parts of the internal surface of the arteries and veins; but the best specimens I have seen have been from the principal veins of large birds (goose, loon, gull), &c. At the * Henle has made a singular speculation concern- ing the nature of this structure: he believes it to be an intermediate stage between the epithelium and the longitudinal fibres next beneath it — that the former is converted into the latter, and that this is its intermediate condition. He believes that the epithelium becomes fused into a continuous sheet, and the nuclei absorbed, and that this subsequently breaks up into fibres, — in short, that fibrous tissue is formed from epithelium, and that, the coats of the vessels derive their density and increase from the epithelial cells secreted on their interior.VEIN. 1371 free margin of valves I have occasionally seen, as noticed above, a clear, structureless rim, which I have imagined to be this membrane reduplicated, the membrane being extremely thin, and the interposd fibrous lamina not reaching quite to the margin. It is said by Henle and others only to exist in a few places, and certainly it is not always to be found, though it is not perhaps right to limit i(s existence to those spots only where it has been recognised, as its extreme tenuity and firm adhesion to the next coat might ac- count for its not being generally seen.* The tissue in question is best seen by slit- ting up a vein and pinning it out on cork. The inner surface is then scratched with a needle after it has been moistened. The fenestrated membrane retracts, and its edges may be ruffled up and a small portion removed by the points of very fine forceps, and thus ob- tained for examination, which is best done without any superimposed glass, as that flattens the coils and folds, and it is impossible to unravel them.

(Magnified 40 diameters.) Infernal tunic "if longitudinal fibres. — The internal tunic of longitudinal fibres is ex- tremely thin, and occupies but a very small amount of the thickness of the vessels' walls. This is well seen in fig. 855. a, which is a trans- verse section of the subclavian vein of an ox, made vertical to the surface, and displaying * It appears to me that there are sufficient grounds to acknowledge the existence of a limitary membrane beneath the epithelium in the blood- vessels, and no sufficient reason to question its uni- versal distribution. It must be recollected that there are certain regions, even in the mucous mem- brane (the nasal fossa, for instance), where no base- ment membrane has been found, and I am not aware that, in the skin, it has ever been separated from the chorion, and yet in neither case is its existence doubted. To exhibit the limitary membrane well, some peculiar mechanical arrangements of the sur- face is necessary, as papilla; or crypts, and such are not presented on the surface of blood-vessels. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that there is here great difficulty in displaying the limitary mem- brane. the relative thickness of the three elementary fibrous coats. Specimens for displaying the profile views of the walls of veins are best obtained by slitting up the vessel, pinning it out upon cork, and suffering it to get dry. Sec- tions are then to be made vertical to the surface, cither parallel to, or at right angles with, the axis of the vessel. Thin shavings may then be removed with a very flat knife (and for this purpose, a Beer's cornea knife is the best), and when placed on a slip of glass, moistened, and covered with a square of thin glass, are ready for observation. The accom- panying drawings were made from sections thus obtained. When a longitudinal section of the in- ternal tunic is examined with a high power, as in fig. 856. a, it is seen to consist of very fine yellow elastic tissue, which is peculiarly pale and indistinct, having mainly a longi- tudinal direction, but being much interlaced and matted together, so that its longitudinal course is, in many situations, obscure. This coat is seen to be fine, and dense, and in strong contrast to all the other structures, from which it is separated by a distinct line of demarcation. When thus viewed, the fibres of this tunic are seen to present a succession of waves, not unlike those of white fibrous tissue, but finer and smaller : whether these undulations are from its own inherent pro- Fig. 856. Longitudinal vertical Section of Wall of Subclavian Vein of an Ox. a, internal coat rather thicker than common; b, mid- dle coat; c, part of external coat. (Magnified 200 diameters.) perties, or whether they are produced by its adhesion to the next tunic, whose elastic con- traction is greater than its own, thus throwing it into folds and waves, I am unable to say! The identity of these fibres with yellow elastic tissue is shown by the action of acetic acid, which does not destroy them, but renders' them even more distinct, while the contiguous1372 VEIN. masses of white fibrous tissue are obliterated. When treated witli this reagent the fibres of this coat lose their wavy character to a cer- tain extent, and present intersecting undula- tions. (Fig. 857. a.) When the internal coat is seen in transverse section, it presents a granular, indistinct appearance, without fibres of any determinate direction : in some places it presents lines of a crumpled or corrugated as- pect. In Jig. 858. a, this may be seen, as also its distinctness from the next coat, from which it is separated at one part by a slight interval. This coat appears to exist in all the veins, and in the smaller ones, and larger capillaries when treated with acetic acid, as hereafter to be described, its presence would seem to be indicated by the internal longitudinal nuclei, which are then displayed. Middle coat of intermixed circular and lon- gitudinal fibres. — This tunic occupies about one-fourth of the entire thickness of the wall of a vein. Its internal boundary is sharp and distinct, where this coat is in contact with the internal, but the outer boundary, where it gra- dually merges into the external, is indefinite, and indeed artificial. In Jig. 856. the middle coat is represented at b, and is composed of intermixed fibres of longitudinal and transverse yellow elastic tissue embedded in a nidus of white fibre. As this figure represents a longitudinal section, the transverse fibres of the yellow element Fig. 857. Longitudinal vertical Section of Wall of Subclavian Vein of Ox, treated with Acetic Acid. a, internal coat; b, middle coat; c, part of external coat. (Magnified 200 diameters.) are seen cut across, and appear as small discs : on the other hand, the longitudinal fibres with which they are mingled, are seen in pro- file, as interlacing and parallel rods: the former gradually diminish, and the latter, in the same proportion, increase, as viewed fur- ther and further from the inner surface; and that point where the discs entirely disappear and the longitudinal fibres alone remain may be considered as the external limit of the middle coat. This limit is very clearly seen in a specimen treated with acetic acid (Jig. 857. b) ; when, as in Jig. 858. b, the sec- tion has been transverse, the discs and rods of yellow elastic tissue occupy a position and proportion the reverse of what has been de- scribed. The discs are the most abundant on the outer, and the rods on the inner part of this coat, the former being seen in section, and the latter in profile. This middle coat is very compact, especi- ally near the inner surface, and it gradually becomes less so in proceeding outwards. It is difficult to tell what is the course and direction of the nidus of white fibrous tissue in which the yellow element is embedded, as in the middle coat it forms a dense granular compact mass*, when seen in situ, and its true nature is only displayed by the action of acetic acid. When, however, portions of the tissue are picked abroad with needles, though its direction is lost, its characters are ob- vious. As it regards the muscularity of this coat, there can exist no doubt. The recent ob- servations of Kolliker on the low form of muscle, which he designates " muscular," or "contractile fibre-cells," have placed this pre- viously obscure subject in an intelligible and satisfactory light, and have done much to ex- plode the idea of non-muscular contraction, by exhibiting the wide diffusion of this hitherto unrecognised tissue. Kolliker describes two forms of fibre-cells as existing in blood-vessels,— one, consisting of short, round, spindle-shaped, or rectangular plates, like epithelium ; the other, of long plates of irregular, rectangular, spindle, or club, shape. The substance of these cells is soft, light yellow, and homogeneous, and each con- tains a peculiar, characteristic nucleus, whose shape is constant, being that of a club or staff. These fibre-cells are placed transversely as it regards the vessel, and constitute a thin coat, immediately external to the lining membrane, intermixed with cellular tissue. These mus- cular elements are clearly seen (as exhibited by their nuclei) by the action of acetic acid on small vessels. (Fig. 860.) He further states that the great develop- ment of the uterine veins during pregnancy is principally from an increased size of the fibre- cells existing in the middle coat, but partlv also from the inner and outer coat acquiring a considerable quantity of smooth muscular fibre. According to the same authority this mus- cular element is not found in the veins of the uterine portion of the placenta, the cerebral T I would here observe, that when white fibrous tissue is dried and re-moistened, as in these sec- tions, it does not regain all its physical characters : it has lost to a great degree its wavy lines, and hence it is not so easily recognized.VEIN. 1373 veins, the cerebral sinuses, Breschet's veins of the bones, and the venous cells of the corpora cavernosa. External coat of longitudinal fibres.—The ex- ternal coat consists of a mass of areolar tissue, adhering together with more or less compact- ness, and running in a longitudinal direction. This tunic occupies full two-thirds of the entire thickness of the whole wall of a vein. Its internal boundary is irregular at the union with the equally irregular outer limit of the middle coat, and its external boundary is the Fig. 858. Transverse vertical Section of Subclavian Vein of Ox. a, internal coat; b, middle coat; c, part of external coat. (Magnified 200 diameters.) loose cellular tissue into which it degenerates, and which constitutes the "sheath" of the vessel. This coat, like the preceding, gradu- ally diminishes in density and compactness as it is examined further and further from its inner limit, though its density is everywhere inferior to that of the middle ; indeed, it may be said that the tissue of which the vessel is composed becomes looser and looser in pro- ceeding outwards from the inner boundary of the middle coat, — this quality passing gradu- ally from one coat to the other. The textural arrangement of this tunic must be examined, like the preceding, from longitudinal and transverse sections. In the former it is seen that bundles of rods of yel- low elastic tissue are disposed in alternate laminae with white fibre, or rather, that the former are embedded in a mass of the latter, and that they are a continuation of the longi- tudinal fibres of the middle coat, which gradu- ally become arranged more and more in strata, and at increasing distances. {Fig. 856. c.) The characters of the white fibrous tissue between the bundles of yellow, become more conspicuous as the laminae are wider apart. The stratified arrangement of the fibres, and their correspondence with the longitudinal rods of the middle coat are very well seen in the specimen treated with acetic {Jig- 857.). When this tunic is viewed in transverse section, the relative thickness and proportion of the lamellae are better seen than in a longi- tudinal cut: the yellow element is seen to occupy but a small relative thickness in com- parison with the white. When viewed with a high magnifying power the divided extremities of the rods of yellow fibrous tissue form undulating, and somewhat imbricated lines of discs, while the white fibrous tissue, cut across, shows slight, indis- tinct, wavy indications. (Fig. 858. c.) Seen with a low power, the ends of the yellow fibrous tissue appear as series of dark undulating dots on a field of white. Minute veins. — When very small veins, a few removes from capillaries, are examined microscopically, they merely present faint stri- ations in the longitudinal direction. When, however, these vessels are treated with acetic acid, nuclei and fibres are distinctly displayed, whose long axis may he assumed to indicate the direction of the tunic (or set of fibres) which they represent, in which they are em- bedded, and of which they form a part. Henle was, I believe, the first to point out this mode of textural dissection of vessels, and nothing can be more satisfactory' than the analysis that it makes. By this means small vessels alone can be examined, but the scru- tiny may be carried up to those the third of a line in diameter, which are sufficiently trans- parent, when entire, to exhibit the nuclei. Small vessels may be conveniently obtained from the pia mater and mesentery ; they are there free from other structures, and their form is not interfered with. I have found, however, that it is in the pia- mater somewhat difficult to trace the small veins; the arteries about them are more de- finite and conspicuous, and less injured by manipulation, and generally catch the attei.- tion of the observer. It has been more con- venient to obtain isolated cerebral veins from the surface of the ventricles of the brain ; the small veins on the corpus striatum may be raised and torn away with the points of fine forceps, and sufficient capillaries will generally be found attached to their extremities to ex- hibit the structure of these vessels of all size. The accompanying figures were made from specimens thus obtained, about whose venous character there could be no mistake. Small veins vary in structure in different regions, and according to their size ; some ap- approach the structure of arteries *, whilst * It may be convenient here to give a brief out- line of the anatomy of capillar;/, and minute, arteries. Their structure is more definite than that of veins; their walls are thicker and their cavity less in pro- portion. The larger ones exhibit both a longitu- dinal and a transverse striation. When treated with acetic acid the nuclear corpuscles are numerous, sharply defined, and obvious in their direction. Capillaries, up to about l-16C0th of an inch in1374 VEIN. others are far removed from them in com- position. Venous capillaries do not, that I am aware of, differ from arterial. They consist of tubes of homogeneous membrane, studded here and there with nuclei of a more or less oval form, and placed generally with their long axis cor- responding with that of the vessel. In passing to larger veins the change in structure of the vessel (its increase and character) depends upon the region from which it is obtained, and whether or not it is endowed with muscle- cells. In the cerebral veins, which have no muscle, in passing from small capillaries to larger vessels, all that is observed is ihe superaddi- tion of a tunic of areolar tissue, surrounding the lining membrane ; and when this tissue is treated with acetic acid, all that is observable is a series of nuclei, oval, irregular, and longi- tudinal, embedded in the substance of the parietes, which have a perfect resemblance to the external, or cellular coat of small arteries. (Fig. 859. a.) In none of the microscopical cerebral veins have I been able to discover any nuclear or yellow fibres. In veins of the ^ to of an inch the vascular wall has been composed of a tissue rendered trans- parent by acetic acid, and displaying oval and irregular nuclei having a longitudinal course, without any admixture of elastic fibre. The mo>t internal of the nuclei appeared elongated, but there was no appearance of fibres upon the internal membrane, so as to produce a striated membrane. In those veins which are endowed with diameter, consist of tubes of homogeneous mem- brane, studded here and there with nuclei of an oval form, whose long axis is that of the vessel, except in the larger ones, where a few are placed transversely. These corpuscles are elongated, and more numerous, in the larger capillaries. In arteries about 1-600th of an inch, the walls consist of a homogeneous tube, with the nuclei on the outer surface still more elongated ; and external to this, a set of nuclei, club-shaped and sharply defined, placed at right angles to the former, and representing the circular (muscular) tunic in which they are embedded. In larger arteries a cellular tissue, still more ex- ternal, is seen, whose corpuscles — oval and irregu- lar— are longitudinal. In such arteries (say, about 1-300th of an inch in diameter), the tunics are, 1st. a homogeneous tube covered with elongated longitudinal nuclei; 2nd. a circular tunic, repre- sented by the club-shaped transverse nuclei ; and 3rd. a longitudinal tunic of cellular tissue, in which are imbedded oval and irregular nuclei. In passing to larger vessels, the nuclei of the internal coat elongate and disappear; and the internal membrane then consists of perfect striated membrane, the homogeneous tube being covered with very fine longitudinal fibres of elastic tissue. Such may be seen in arteries of l-100th to l-60th of an inch in diameter, and in some much smaller. Fibres make their appearance shortly afterwards in the circular tunic, intermixed with the club-shaped nuclei. The proportion existing between the diameter of an artery and the thickness of its walls is sub- ject to considerable variety; and the same may be said of the relative thickness of the several tunics which compose the wall. Henle has given good figures of the structure of arteries. muscular tissue, small club-shaped nuclei are observed placed externally to the lining mem- Fig. 853.

Such may be seen in the small veins of the mesentery, which are more easily examined than any other veins of this class. In these vessels, two or three removes from capillaries, the muscular nuclei make their appearance, at first, few in number and irregular ; and in still larger, but microscopical veins, these nuclei are seen to be mixed up with, or covered in by, more or less areolar tissue, which at first is destitute of nuclear fibre, but contains conspicuous nuclei, oval and irregular in shape and longitudinal in direction. In the accompanying drawing (fig. 860. is) is a small vein from the mesentery of a rabbit, measuring about Tl^T of an inch in diameter, and treated with acetic acid. On the lining membrane are seen a few elongated nuclei and longitudinal striations, constituting a sort of incipient striated membrane. External to this is a thin layer of muscular tissue, and without that, again, is cellular tissue, which constitutes the main bulk of the vascular wall. The muscular coat is less distinct than in arteries of the same size and thinner in pro- portion to the areolar coat. Such veins have, however, a strong resem- blance to small arteries. Henle states that the two systems of vessels are not to be dis- tinguished in those measuring up to lr±^ of an inch ; and he appears to consider thinness of until as the main characteristic in larger micro- scopical veins. He instances one vessel, which he considers as venous, measuring -gK of an inch in entire diameter, having an annular tunic i^i-^, and a cellular yryV- °f an inch. It has appeared to me that the differences of these vessels are principally these,— micro- scopical veins have thinner walls ; the mus-1375 VEIN. ciilar tunic is less distinct, thinner than the areolar, with which it is more or less mixed up, and the latter is more abundant and more developed than in small arteries. In passing to vessels of larger size, the fibrous tissue is seen to have a more conspi- cuous development. The longitudinal stri- Fig. 860.

(Magnified 200 diameters.) ations and fibres on the lining membrane form a perfect striated membrane, and, in still larger vessels, increase so as to constitute a compact coat of fibres, of more or less density — the internal tunic of longitudinal fibres. In the middle coat, the muscular element becomes involved and mixed up with areolar tissue, some fibres of which run parallel, and some at right angles to the muscular nuclei. The external tunic of areolar tissue becomes in- creasingly developed, and yellow fibrous tissue conspicuous and abundant.* In fig. 860. a, is represented part of the renal vein of a rabbit. The vessel is not cut open or seen in section, but is simply laid upon glass, treated with acetic acid, and a small portion of the margin submitted to mi- croscopical scrutiny. The internal membrane is densely striated, and the other coats de- veloped in proportion. * In the comparative examination of small and large blood vessels, there is much to confirm Henle's doctrine of nuclear and cell fibre. In the capillaries, which are mere tubular cells, there is no fibre, and the nucleus is persistent; in larger vessels, where fibrous tissue is developed, the nucleus disappears and yellow fibre is found : but in those veins which retain abundant persistent nuclei, as the cerebral veins, even in those of larger size, no nuclear fibre is detected. There are certain regions in which the veins undergo striking modifications in structure, which require description ; and the remarkable organs — valves — placed in their interior are yet to be considered. These points will be examined as follows: — I. Veins, at their junction with the heart. II. Cava;, passing through the diaphragm and pericardium. III. Cerebral sinuses. IV. Umbilical vein. V. Venous valves. I. At the junction of the veins with the heart there is a great alteration in their composition, and this as it respects both cava, and the pul- monary veins: they assume a muscular cha- racter, and become thicker and red, which arises from a prolongation of the muscle of the auricle into the fibrous structure of the vein. This anatomical fact, as far as the cavae are concerned, was described as early as 1664, by Borelli ; subsequently (1700), by Eidloo, who gave figures of it; and afterwards (1779), by Goiter, who imagined that the muscle was continued into the smaller vessels, and that it there assumed a paler colour. This muscular layer (though its existence is denied by Cruveilhier) may be followed upon the superior vena cava as far as the cla- vicle, upon the inferior as far as the diaphragm, and upon the pulmonary veins as far as the division of the trunks into branches. (Henle.) It exists on the superior cava in greater amount than on the inferior, and it is there best submitted to examination. When viewed with the naked eye, the vena cava superior, at its junction with the heart, is seen to be red and muscular, and thicker than elsewhere. In following this away from the heart, the muscular character gradually diminishes, and the ordinary fibrous tissue assumes the pre- ponderance till the former is altogether lost. At ten lines from the junction of the vessel with the heart the mass was removed from which the accompanying drawing was taken. The cavae of some birds are sufficiently thin and transparent to be vitwed with transmitted light when entire, and when slit up and held to the light a beautiful arrangement of these fibres is seen : they do not form one flat, even, circular, covering, but are arranged in numerous, successive, interrupted, rings, very fine and red, gradually diminishing as they are seen further from the heart. I have observed this in the red-throated diver (Co/ymbm sep- tentrionalis), moor-hen {Gallinula chloropu.s), and various other birds. According to Cuvicr, in the ostrich, muscular fibres extend the whole length of the posterior cava, and dis- appear suddenly opposite the kidneys. When a little mass of this structure is ex- amined with the microscope, it is found to consist of muscle of the same character as that of the heart, — the fibres being smali, striped (though, perhaps, rather less distinctly so than that of the auricle or ventricle), and, as far as I have seen, destitute of sarcolemma. There is a good deal of wavy fibrous tissue, inter- mixed with the muscle ; in this respect, con-1376 VEIN. trasting remarkably with that of the heart: this exists in less amount in the immediate vicinity of that organ. There is yet another peculiarity in the structure of the great veins near the heart,— they have a partial investment of the serous layer of the pericardium ; this, however, exists only on the anterior surface ; and in the in- ferior cava the amount of serous covering is very small.

When the caves pass through the peri- cardium and diaphragm they contract an inti- mate connection with those structures whose fibrous tissue is more or less reflected upon them and adds to their coats. Upon the su- perior cava are to be seen (external to the pericardium) white, glistening fibres, having a longitudinal course, and traceable from the pericardium directly upon the vein. The pulmonary veins have a similar covering. In the human subject, the inferior cava passes through the pericardium and diaphragm at once, and there forms so intimate an ad- hesion to the margin of the aperture that I have removed striped muscle (of the dia- phragm) from the fibrous tissue of the vessel, it having taken its origin from the outer tunic of the vein. In many of the lower animals (as in the sheep, cat, and rabbit,) there is a considerable interval between the diaphragm and pericar- dium, in which the vena cava inferior is in- vested with a covering of fibrous tissue con- tributed from both these sources. It is white, glistening, and strictly longitudinal, and is fur- nished in largest amount by the pericardium. III. Cerebral sinuses.—The cerebral sinuses hold the place of large veins to the brain, but are materially different from large veins in structure. They consist of excavations or tubes in the substance of the dura mater,— the dura mater is, as it were, split into two layers, and the interval is the cavity of the sinus. Their form, which is very irregular— triangular, quadrilateral, &c. — differs in dif- ferent situations. The internal or lining membrane of the sinuses is stated by all anatomists to be iden- tical with that of the veins ; but its exact amount and nature I have not myself ascer- tained. The continuity of the lining mem- brane with that of the veins is seen where the sinuses join the veins; thus, at the ca- vernous sinus, where the ophthalmic vein and circular sinus join it, the lining membrane adheres to the inner wall of the sinus, but is separated from the outer by the carotid artery and certain nerves. The other element of the walls of these peculiar veins is the white fibrous tissue of the dura mater, arranged without any regularity. The inner surface of these vessels is smooth, but rendered ex- tremely irregular by the occurrence of nu- merous fibrous processes on bands projecting into their cavity. In the superior longitudinal sinus, the cavernous, and middle basilar, this is most conspicuous. In the first mentioned of these, the fibrous bands have been called " cordec WiUisiancc" (after Willis, their first desciiber). They are slips of white fibrous tissue passing from the sides of the sinus, es- pecially near the angles, attached at both extremities, and either free or attached along one side : these give the appearance as if the inner surface were divided into cells ; into some of these the probe enters and passes on into the veins on the surface of the brain; others are blind, or lead to lesser sinuses, which not un- frequcntly run parallel, for some length, to the great sinus; or the probe passes from one of these cells to another. In the cavernous sinus these fibrous bands are so numerous that they look like a mass of areolar tissue, whose areolae are distended with blood. The cordae Willisianae are traversed by minute arteries. (Sir C. B II.) IV. The umbilical vein has a structure quite peculiar to itself. The vessel may be best examined by splitting it up with a director and pinning it down on cork, with its inner surface upwards. It is then seen to be smooth, valveless, and whiter than other veins. From the inner surface I have obtained epithelium : the cells were flat, irregular in outline, granular and fatty. On making an incision, the membrane of which it is composed retracts, so as to leave a gap, and displays the dense fibrous mass which forms the basis of the cord. It tears off in irregular shreds, not showing a tendency to tear in any particular direction. With care, considerable portions of the membrane may be stripped off'. This structure is soft, elastic,1377 VEIN. and semi-pellucid. It appears structureless to the naked eye, and looks almost like a thin film of fecula jelly (arrow-root made with water), or rather, perhaps, like the flaccid dull cornea of an animal dead some clays. When separated, it coils up, and, where the surfaces have become adherent, it is difficult to unfold it again : it now looks and feels like thick mucus — it is semitransparent and adhesive. When seen under the microscope, it is found to be indis- tinctly fibrous ; some masses appear as a dense web of flat fibres, the fibres being strictly on the same plane, with their sides adherent at some points, and leaving intervals at others ; in some places the interspaces are only small specks on the surface of what appears to be in other respects, an almost homogeneous sheet; there are also some indistinct longi- tudinal striations, connecting these minute interspaces and obscurely indicating the out- line of fibres. The element of which this coat is composed is singularly pellucid under the microscope, scarcely refracting excepting at its edges. The fibrous mass of which the vein is com- posed, in many places exhibits the appearance as if the fibres were formed of spindle-shaped cells strung together, with their ends over- lapping ; and these cells may be occasionally isolated, — they are spindle-shaped and have an oval nucleus. They resemble those ob- tained from the middle coat of the aorta of a foetal pig, by Lehmann. (See his figure.) Whether this condition is the result of im- perfect maturation of the tissue of which the vein is composed, or otherwise, I am unable to say. V. Valves. — The valves are membranous folds on the inner surface of the veins, having a definite form and regular arrangement with regard to their object—the progress of the venous blood to the heart, and obstruction to its regurgitation. They are of peculiar interest to the physiologist, as presenting a clear and elegant specimen of animal mechanics; and to the literary anatomist they are not less inter- esting, as having been one of the main objects which suggested to Harvey his brilliant de- duction of the circulation of the blood. Cruveilhier states that the valves of veins were first discovered by Etienne. Harvey leaves the priority of discovery in doubt; for he writes, " The celebrated Hieronymus Fa- bricius of Aquapendente, a most skilful ana- tomist and venerable old man; or, as the learned liiolan will have it, Jacobus Sylvius, first gave representations of valves in the veins."* Fabricius himself lays claim to the discovery, " non solum nulla prorsus mentio de ipsis facta sit, sed neque aliquis prius base viderit, quam anno Domini septuagesimo quarto, supra millesimum et quingentesimum, quo a me summa cum laetitia inter disse- candum observata fuere."-]- Marx, who ap- * Harvey on the Motion of the Heart and Blood, Sydenham Society's Translation, chap. xiii. ■f Fabricius, ab Aquapendente.

IV. pears to be profoundly versed in the literature of this subject, says the discovery is due to Erasistratus ; for he observes, " Erasistratus (30-t B.C.), item clarus anatomus jam subtilius in structuram et usum venarum inquisivit, valvulas jam observavit."* Harvey's description of the valves is so apposite and clear, as well as so interesting in a literary point of view, that I shall quote it. The valves, he observes, " consist of raised or loose portions of the inner membrane of these vessels, of extreme delicacy, and a sig- moid or semilunar shape. They are situated at different distances from one another, and diversely in different individuals ; they are connate at the sides of the veins ; they are directed upwards or towards the trunks of the veins; the two—for there are, for the most part, two together — regard each other, mu- tually touch, and are so ready to come into contact by their edges, that if any thing at- Fig. 862. a, femoral vein; b, saphena interna. tempt to pass from the trunks into the branches of the veins, or from the greater veins into less, they completely prevent it; they are further so arranged, that the horns of those that succeed are opposite the middle of the convexity of those that precede, and so on, alternately." He further writes, " In many places two valves are so placed and fitted, that, when raised, they come exactly together * Marx. Diatribe Anatomico-physiologica de Structura atque Vita Venarum. Carls. 1819, p. 6. f Fabricius, Opera omnia, tab. iv. p. 15/. 4 T1378 VEIN. in the middle of the vein, and are there united by the contact of their margins ; and so accurate is the adaptation, that neither by the eye, nor by any other means, can the slightest chink along the line of contact be perceived. But if the probe be now intro- duced from the extreme towards the more central parts, the valves, like the flood-gates of a river, give way, and are most readily pushed aside."* Valves exist in two different situations ; namely, at the orifices of lesser veins where they join the trunks which they supply, and in the canals of veins, arranged at various points. Fig. 863. Diagram exhibiting different forms of Valves. a, valve placed at the orifice of the renal vein in the sheep, seen in face; a', the same in ideal section; the ordinary semilunar valve from the tube of a vein; V, the same in section ; c, imperfect valve at orifice of intercostal vein ; c', section of imperfect valve at orifice of hepatic vein; d, the same in face (the dotted lines in a, c and d correspond to the orifices of the respective veins); e, very imperfect valve; e1, the same in section ; f plan of double valve at orifice of vein ; ft, the same in section ; g, ideal section of small valve and sinus; h, sec- tion of sinus without a valve. At the orifices of veins the valves are either single or double: when single, the free margin always looks towards the heart. In the canals of veins the valves are usually double in the larger, and single in the smaller. It is rare, in the human subject, to find them in threes * Loc. cit. on the same plane, though it has been found both by Morgagni and Haller ; but in the great vessels of the larger mammalia it is common. There are none in the capillaries ; but, accord- ing to Henle, in veins of not more than half a line in diameter, they make their appear- ance. For the purposes of anatomical description a valve may be said to have a body, margins, and cornua. The body of the valve has a cardiac, concave, or proximal face and a convex or distal face. The margins are,—the free, or that which is unattached, and the attached margin. The cornua are the angles formed by the meeting of the two margins, and constitute the extreme lateral boundaries of the valve. Valves differ from each other very con- siderably in form, varying from a mere linear elevation on the inner surface, in which the probe scarcely hitches as it is pushed along, to others which almost form a long isosceles triangle. The outline of the margins deter- mines the form of a valve. Cruveilhier says that the free margin is always straight ; but this is not the fact, though it is always more so than the attached. In the first attempt at a valvular formation there is merely a slight elevation of the inner surface, and the free and attached margins are nearly parallel: these scarcely constitute valves. (Fig. 863. c,e'.) Valves, stdl imperfect but of larger dimen- sions, are found at the orifices of veins, as well as in their canals. When existing in the former situation (and this is applicable to all valves thus placed), their attached margin corres- ponds with the side of the orifice which is furthest from the heart, and the outline of this margin is determined by the form of the vessel's mouth. If the lesser vessel joins the greater at right angles, the opening will be circular, and the attached margin of the valve a semicircle. If, however, the junction be ob- lique, and an acute angle be formed by the two vessels, then the margin attached will be drawn out of the semicircle, so as to form a sort of apex in the centre. The former of these conditions is shown at fig. 863. c, taken from a small valve at the orifice of an inter- costal vein, joining the azygos; and the latter is represented at d, which is a drawing made from a valve at the orifice of an hepatic vein, where it joins the vena cava: c is an ideal section of the same. The dotted line in a,c and d represents, in conjunction with the line of the attached margin of the valve, the orifice of the tributary vein. The next form, in order, and the one which is the most common, is the semi-lunar* valve, as it is ordinarily found in the tube of valved veins,— the attached margin being nearly semi- circular, and the free nearly straight (Jig. 863. b). It was probably of these valves that Haller spoke when he said that the attached margin of valves constitutes a parabolic curve: it may be applicable to some of the semi-lunar, * Pabricius, not inaptly, described them as re- sembling a finger nail, " forma ostiolorum ea est, ut indicia ungueni imitentur."—Loc. cit. p. 151,VEIN. 1.379 4 t 2 but it cannot be to valves in general: a para- bola is a constant form, but the outline of the valves is various. It appears to me that the outline of a valve rather conforms to the ellipse, the curve being sometimes very much elongated, sometimes nearly approaching a circle. An ellipse is obtained from a cylinder, by an oblique section of it; an oblique sec- tion of a cylinder will only give an ellipse. For the line of attachment, therefore, of a valve with the cylindrical surface of a vein to generate an elliptical curve, that line of attach- ment must coincide with an oblique section of the cylinder : and we see that this is fre- quently the case, that is, when the valve is viewed in profile, its attached margin forms a right line at an angle, more or less acute, with the wall of the vein, the acuteness of the angle determining the elongation of the el- lipse. This is represented inJig.86-i.n, where a shows the line of attachment seen in profile, and «' the curve generated by that line when seen in face. But sometimes the attached margin does not form, when viewed laterally, a straight line, but is more or less curved, as seen at Jig. B, b b', and then we necessarily get Fig. 864. A a a A i \ a!

B, exhibits the lines of attachment of, a, elliptical valve in profile, and a', the resulting form; b, the attachment of parabolic valve in profile, and V, the resulting form. an aberration from the ellipse, and an approxi- mation, more or less near, to the parabola. Now, in such valves as are placed in pairs in the canals of veins, with their convex faces opposing and their cornua in contact, their relative length and breadth depend upon the obliquity of their attachment,— the require- ments being constant, namely, that the op- posed valves should meet by their free mar- gins in aline across the centre of the vessel,— for if the attachment be oblique and extend more in the axis of the vessel, it will require a much deeper valve to reach its fellow in the centre, than if the attachment were more across the tube, where a short, broad valve would accomplish the object. These two con- ditions are represented in the figure (Jig. SG4. a.), which is an ideal section of a vein, in which both forms of valves are seen in a state of action. Valves in the canals of veins, though in contact by their cornua, are sufficiently loose and large to fall back fully upon the sides of the vessels to allow the progressing current to pass on uninterruptedly. A valve the furthest removed in form from those first mentioned, is represented in Jig. 863. a, which is the drawing of a valve situated at the orifice of the emulgent vein, where it joins the inferior cava in the sheep. Its depth is very considerable in proportion to its width, and the centre of its attached margin is nearly an acute angle, produced by the angle at which the renal vein joins the cava.* Structure of valves. — A venous valve con- sists of a thin fibrous lamina, protruded into the tube of the vessel. If the attached margin be carefully cut from the wall of a vein, and the organ be extended upon a slip of glass, it is seen to be thin at the free margin and thick at the attached ; if it be viewed by transmitted light, with the naked eye, it will be seen that the body of the valve is divided, rather indistinctly, into two portions, of which the free half is thinner and bluish-white, while the other is much thicker, and of a yellowish colour ; the line of demarcation, between these, extending across the body of the valve about parallel with the free margin ; this however, does not exist, in some valves. The examination of a valve with the mi- croscope requires that it should be completely unfolded at its free margin, in the neighbour- hood of which, in the larger valves, its struc- ture can alone be successfully observed, on account of the thickness and opacity of the other parts of the valve. When removed from a vein it should be placed upon a slip of glass, moistened, and, the attached margin being seized with forceps, it should be drawn over the surface of the glass so as to unravel any folds of the free margin, which are apt to occur. The epithelium cannot always be found on the face of the valve, and to see it the body must be very thin, and the focus of the in- strument be thrown superficial to the fibrous lamina, when their nuclei will sometimes be viewed pretty distinctly. They are scattered evenly over the surface, but the cell-wall is extremely ill-defined, or not to be made out. At the margin of the valve they are frequently to be seen in one or two conditions, — free, detached nuclei, accidentally adherent along the margin ; or cells, seen edgewise, with con- spicuous nuclei, as already described. The Jibro7is lamina is the most conspicuous element of the valve, and constitutes its bulk. It consists almost entirely of white fibrous tissue, extending from side to side of the valve, running parallel with the free margin, and continuous, apparently, with the circular coat of the vein on each side of the attached * The extreme depth of the valve here represented is not constant; it sometimes barely reaches across the orifice.1380 VEIN. margin of the valve. The fibres are singularly regular, and present the most beautiful and equal undulations, as if each fibre were of exactly the same size and extent; and the un- dulations of all succeeding fibres are precisely similar, as far as the tenuity of the structure towards its attached margin is sufficient to allow of its examination. These fibres may be looked upon as a portion of the circular coat protruded into the cavity of the vein. Fig 865. Small Portions of the Valves from a Sheep. A, The valve showing a line of epithelial nuclei at the extreme margin a a'; a', detached nuclei; b, small portion of face of valve, exhibiting wavy fibres, epithelium and muscle. B, the same treated with acetic acid, a a, margin. On the face of this valve are seen two sets of nuclei; and fine threads of elastic fibre. {Mag- nified 200 diameters.} Running at right angles to these, and placed upon a different plane, are to be seen fibres or elongated corpuscles of a spindle shape, and of very variable distinctness. These cor- puscles are apparently muscular fibre-cells: they are very conspicuous in some specimens, and very indistinct in others ; whilst in others they cannot be discovered at all. On treating a valve with acetic acid, two sets of nuclear corpuscles are to be discovered, running at right angles to each other. Those which are parallel with the wavy fibres of the fibrous lamina are mainly oval, interspersed with a few more elongated; and those, cutting the former at right angles, and being parallel with the muscular fibre-cells, are club-shaped and spindle-shaped, having a strong resem- blance to the nuclei of muscular fibre-cells. The former, as it appears to me, are mainly persistent nuclei of areolar tissue, and belong to the wavy fibres, whilst the latter are evi- dently muscular nuclei. Small threads of yel- low fibre are occasionally seen. They are very fine, detached and scattered ; and fre- quently exhibit a spiral form. In examining these structures it is necessary that, when removed from the body, they should not be allowed to dry before the observations are completed ; for the characters both of the fibrous lamina and nuclei are impaired per- manently if they have once been dry. Sinuses. — There is yet another item in the valvular apparatus of venous canals, — the oc- currence of sinuses in the walls of the veins. These consist of small pouches or dilatations in the walls of the veins immediately in front of the valves. By these, the cylindrical form of the vessel is lost at that spot, two bulgings being apparent on it. These bulgings pro- duce a certain amount of attenuation at these points, the thinness being in direct proportion to the increased area produced. The sinuses vary in dimensions, and do not bear any exact proportion to the size of the valve. Lateral dilatations maybe seen in the walls of veins where no valves are present. (See^g/863., b',g, e , h.) When the valves are in action, these distended sinuses present knots along the course of the vessel; an appear- ance first described and figured by Fabricius: he observes of them, " non dissimilem for- mam exterius pras se ferentes, ac nodi in plan- tarum ramulis, et cattle apparent."* The supply of valves in the venous system is only partial, and is irregular. Valves are only found (in the human subject) in those veins which are subjected to muscular pressure, and are, therefore, most abundant in the veins of the limbs : and it has been well laid down by Cruveilhier, " that their pre- sence and their number, their proximity and their distance from each other are directly influenced by the degree of opposition to the onward progress of the blood in any set of veins." f Of the veins of the head and neck, the ex- ternal jugular is the only one with valves : it possesses two, which however are not suffi- ciently compact to oppose injection. There are none in the cerebral sinuses or veins, and none in the internal jugular. The veins of the upper extremity are abundantly supplied with valves, which appear to be somewhat more numerous near the upper part of the arm. There are valves in the axillary vein, but none in the subclavian, vena innominata, or superior cava. They are abundant in the lower extremity, but most numerous at its lower part; in this respect differing from the superior extremity. The branches of the internal iliac vein are supplied with valves, while the external and internal iliacs them- selves, the common iliac, and the inferior cava, have none. The spermatic veins (male) have valves, while the ovarian (female) are desti- tute of them. In the azygos veins, Cruveil- hier denies the existence of valves, but they are occasionally found in an imperfect state of development. The spinal veins are destitute of valves, as are, also, those of the portal system, the he- patic veins, those of the heart, kidney, uterus * Loc. cit. For figures of these " nodi," see Fa- bricius, Opera omnia, tab. II. p. 157. ; also Harvey, De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus, Ana- tomiea Exercitatio. Lugd. Bat. 1639, p. 187. f Cruveilhier. Anatomie Descriptive.1381 VEIN. and lungs. Comparative anatomy and acci- dental aberrations from nature furnish some exceptions to the foregoing statements. Meyer has found incomplete valves in the pulmonary veins. Theile has found valves in the ova- rian veins. E. H. Weber has observed them in the portal veins of the horse ; and Cuvier, in the same animal, has found them in the splenic and mesenteric veins. Haller has dis- covered valves in the pulmonary veins of the dog and sheep. Valves exist but sparingly in Birds and Cetaceans; and in R/ptiles and Fish are almost wanting. The office of valves is to prevent the blood from effecting a retrograde course; "lest, instead of advancing from the extreme to the central parts of the body, the blood should rather proceed along the veins from the centre to the extremities ; but the delicate valves, while they readily open in the right direction, entirely prevent all such contrary motion; being so situated and arranged, that if any thing escapes, or is less perfectly ob- structed by the cornua of the one above, the fluid, passing, as it were, by the chinks be- tween the cornua, is immediately received on the concavity of the one beneath, which is placed transversely with reference to the former, and so is effectually hindered from getting any farther." * This refers especially to the valves in the venous canals. There is a peculiarity about those placed at the orifices of veins. I have already remarked that all single valves placed at the mouths of veins are attached to the distal margin of the orifice : the free margin looks towards the heart, the concave face obliquely towards the cavity of the tributary, and the convex in the opposite direc- tion. Now it is obvious from this arrange- ment, that when the blood falls back upon the concave surface of such a valve, it throws it more or less across the area of the larger trunk, and away from the orifice of the smaller vessel, over which it forms no pro- tection. The office of the single valve, thus placed, appears to be not to guard the small veins, or to prevent the retrocessant blood from passing into it, but to oppose the blood which it supplies from passing into that por- tion of the recipient vein which is behind the orifice of the tributary : the valve, as it were, directs the blood into the onward track of the great vein, and prevents it from taking an opposite course. The case, however, is different where the valvular apparatus is double, for there a valve is placed at the proximal, as well as at the distal margin of the orifice : now the former of these valves prevents the blood from pass- ing behind the other into the smaller vein — the two valves mutually assist each other, and prevent the blood from passing behind either; and the result is a complete obstruction to a'l retrograde circulation into the smaller vessel. The important object of exclusion of venous blood from the thoracic duct is thus effected. * Harvey, loc. fit. Valves are essentially jmssivc organs in the circulation ; and they only avail when mo- tion is given to the circulating fluid by other means, — they determine what shall, and what shall not, be the direction of the moving fluid. The contraction of the muscles is one of the great motor agents of the venous circulation. When a muscle contiguous to a vein con- tracts, the vessel is compressed and the blood forced out of it; and, were it not for the valves placed at the distal side of the com- pressed point, the blood would be sent as much from, as towards, the heart. Autenrieth has put this in a striking point of view; he says, " Each swelling muscle becomes thereby, for the neighbouring veins, a kind of heart furnished with valves; thus, while it presses the vein, the valves prevent the blood in the lower part of the same from being driven backwards ; but, in the upper part, opening valves are placed, from which the blood, driven forth by the contracting muscle, meets with no opposition in its direction to- wards the heart. It is from this circumstance that each violent movement of the body, which consists in an alternate swelling up and sink- ing down of the muscles, has so great a ten- dency to accelerate the circulation ; naturally, however, while the muscles are in a state of repose, the valves cannot facilitate the move- ment of the blood."* The function of the sinuses is this,—to re- ceive the valves when they are folded back, during the onward current of the blood; and to allow the blood to pass behind them and to throw them across the area of the vessel when that fluid regurgitates. Vasa vasorum. — The coats of all blood ves- sels, except those of very small size, are sup- plied with arteries and veins especially devoted to their nutrition, called " vasa vasorum." According to Henle, vessels (veins and arteries in common) receive vasa vasorum, though themselves not larger than of an inch in diameter, and sometimes even smaller. The coats of capillaries and those of the smallest vessels are not thus nourished by a separate vascular supply. The nutrient arteries of the venous coats are derived from the small arterial trunks in the vicinity of the vessel \ ; they do not come directly from larger arterial trunks, but from smaller vessels; and the source of the vascular supply is determined by the particular neigh- bourhood of the vein — the same vessel having vasa vasorum from different sources as it passes along different regions : thus, the vena azygos is nourished by the intercostal, pericardial, and oesophageal, arteries, according to its various relations as it proceeds along its course. The arteries supplying the tunics or' a vein, appear to go promiscuously to the vessel and the adjacent tissues, sending some of its ramules to the areolar tissue, nerves, fat, &c, in the neighbourhood, and others to the walls of the vessel. In the accompanying figure, repre- * Autenrieth. Physiologie, §§ 388, 389. t The artery usually has its vascular supply from the same source as the vein which accompanies it. + T 31382 VEIN. senting a vein from the oesophagus of an eel, magnified with low power, the vasa vasorum are seen to supply, indiscriminately, the vessel's coats and some small pellets of adipose tissue which were near it. The arteries, nourishing a vein, ramify and divide principally upon, and among, its cellular coat, and form an elaborate plexus, with meshes having a general longi- tudinal direction, as seen in the figure ; which, Fig. 866.

Natural injection. (Magnified about 18 diameters.) though drawn from a fish, sufficiently indicates the condition as found in man and mammals. The arrangement of these capillaries is, how- ever, subject to variety : in the vena cava of the cod, I have seen them long, straight, even, and perfectly parallel, with scarcely any trans- verse branching or anastomosis. The little venous trunks of the vasa vasorum usually open directly into the cavity of the vein, among whose tunics they have previously ramified, and their course is quite independent of the corresponding arteries. (Henle.) The vasa vasorum principally exist in the areolar tunic, but Henle states that they are to be found abundantly among the annular fibres of the veins.* The internal longitu- dinal coat is, in all cases, extra-vascular. Nerves of veins. — As far as our knowledge hitherto goes, veins differ remarkably from arteries in rarely being made the support of * In arteries, Weber has never found them in the circular tunic. Burdaeh states that he has found a few. nerves, and in seldom receiving any distribu- tion of them to their coats. It is a remark- able circumstance that veins appear, with slight exceptions, to be separated from nerves. The exceptions to this rule are few and in- considerable. The inferior vena cava receives some small filaments from the diaphragmatic ganglion of the sympathetic, just below the diaphragm. The vena porta supports and is entwined by the branches of the hepatic plexus, which it conducts to the liver. Pappenheim describes some nerves as being distributed to the cere- bral veins. Bidder states that he has traced some filaments of the fourth cerebral nerve to the lateral sinus: and Wrisberg describes a nervous plexus as surrounding the facial vein, which he ingeniously imagines may cause contractions of the vein, and thereby pro- duce that congestion of the face constituting blushing. In the cod-fish (Gadus morrhua), I have traced nerves from the auricle down upon the venous sinus immediately below it: these formed loops in the walls of the sinus, and appeared to return to the heart. The nerves in question are doubtless a continuation of the cardiac nerves ; and, in all probability, bear the same relation to the rhythmical action of this pulsating cavity, which the other car- diac nerves do to the cavities of the heart itself. It is very probable that some such nervous supply is furnished to those parts of the veins of man and mammals, near the heart, in which cardiac muscle is found. It may, perhaps, be still a question whether the almost complete non-nervous character of veins is absolutely correct, and whether the paucity or tenuity of the nerves, supplied to veins in general, be not the reason why they have as yet eluded observation; for analogy scarcely justifies the idea of organs possessing muscular tissue and still being destitute of nerves. This opinion is strengthened by the fact that arteries, having the same sort of muscularity as veins, though in larger amount, are regularly supplied with nerves. Comparative structure. — I am not aware of any observations upon the comparative structure of veins in birds anil reptiles. Those that I have myself made are principally in- troduced under the heads, Fenestrated mem- brane, Epithelium, 8fc. In Birds, the venous walls are composed principally of areolar tissue, external to the lining membrane; and I have observed that in the diving-birds, the vena cava posterior is composed almost solely of elastic tissue- There are no muscle-cells in the cerebral veins of birds. In Fishes, the venous parietes appear to be formed of a sort of areolar tissue longitudi- nally disposed. Embedded in the walls of the veins there is an abundance of pigment, which exists in greater quantity in the inter- costal veins, and those tributary to the car- dinal vein. This pigment is of the variety called by Schwann " stellate pigment cells,"VEIN. 1383 and consists of branched cells, of a black colour, and various form. The body of the cell is generally some modification of an oval or oblong, and lies with its long axis corres- ponding to that of the vessel; and from its extremities Cauda; project, of every imaginable shape and proportion, of larger size than those which project from its sides, which are few and small. The body of each cell appears to be occupied by its nucleus. Fig 867. Veins from Fish exhibiting Pigment cells. A, vein from muscle of eel (Anguilla acutirostris) (Magnified 50 diameters').

They also vary in the same individual in different situations : in the cardinal vein they are most numerous and aggregated ; in smaller veins they are less numerous and more distinct; and in those of minute size, they only occur here and there at considerable intervals, and at the spots where they are placed they occupy nearly the whole face of the vessel. When submitted to high microscopical power, these cells are seen to be mixed up with the tissue of the venous coats, and their thin branched extremities have, in some places, much the aspect of elastic tissue, in the uni- formity of their dimensions and their dicho- tomous divisions. Caudal venous heart of eel.—Dr. Marshall Hall, in 1831, first figured and described a peculiar pulsating organ which exists in the tail of the eel, calling it by the name of "caudal heart; " and he considered it to be a muscular ventricle, by whose contractions the blood is propelled in the vein at the commencement of which it is placed. Rusconi has differently interpreted this organ, and calls it a lymphatic heart, believing that it is perfectly analogous to those pul- sating sacs, which are found in certain parts of the lymphatic systems of various reptiles. And certainly the occurrence of a little pul- sating organ, having the form, colour, and general aspect of the lymphatic hearts in the frog, situated in the vicinity of the venous system, having an action independent of the systemic heart, and existing in a cold-blooded animal, is, from analogy, enough to suggest the idea that Rusconi's view is the correct one. But this is not confirmed by anatomy, for after repeated and numerous observations of this heart, I am convinced that the original description of it, given by Dr. Hall, is the truth. The caudal heart is to be found in eels of all sizes, but is best seen in small individuals a few inches in length, on account of their clear skin, and the larger proportional size of the organ in them. It may be seen by holding the eel's tail between the light and the eye of the observer, either with a lens, or without the aid of any magnifying power. It may be con- veniently examined with the microscope by wrapping the head of the animal in a wet cloth, and then applying its tail to a slip of glass, and placing it under the field of the instrument; but the extreme restlessness of the little fish some- times renders it necessary that it should be partially or completely stunned before it can be viewed. The heart is then seen to be Fig. 868. Caudal Venous Heart of Eel magnified about 25 diameters. A and B represent two forms, a, the heart: b car- dinal vein; c sinus that receives the blood from the capillaries; d, minute veins from caudal fin. placed near the extremity of the cardinal vein, on the haemal aspect of the caudal vertebra; at the end of the tail. It is of a yellowish colour, chequered more or less with stellate pigment, and of a form varying from a pear- shape to a spindle-shape. (Fig. 868.) At the distal extremity it is connected with a small vein, which collects the blood from the capillaries of the tail ; at its proximal ex- tremity it is connected with the commenc- ing cardinal vein ; or it may be said that on I T iVEIN. 1384 either side is the cardinal vein, and that the heart is a muscular development on the coats of that vessel. The action of this heart ap- pears to be quite independent of the branchial heart ; for, as Dr. Hall observes, " whilst the latter beats sixty, the former beats one hun- dred and sixty times in a minute. It con- tinues for a very long time after the influence of the pulmonic heart is entirely removed."* I have never seen the action of the caudal heart quite so rapid as is described by Dr. Hall : in one individual, partly torpid from cold, it contracted but sixty times in the minute; but when this fish was warmed, the number rose to one hundred and two, — the beats of the branchial heart being less than half the caudal. The blood, which is deep red, appears to flow into the extreme end of this organ in a continuous stream, but is forced out at each contraction from the other aperture in an interrupted current. The absence of any re- gurgitation, at the further end of the heart, would suggest the presence of some valvular apparatus there situate. The jet of blood, sent forward at each contraction, may be beautifully seen by holding up the tail of the eel to the light; it is seen as a regular, ar- terial, per-saltum, jet, passing along the vessel in front of the heart, which, in the intervals of each contraction, is empty: as Dr. Hall expresses it, the blood is " propelled with great velocity, at first with the appearance of successive drops.''-)- This per sal turn cur- rent only exists a short distance, and gradu- ally degenerates into a continuous, venous, stream. When the parts are submitted to low magnifying power, I have observed that at each systole of the heart the veins at the distal extremity of the organ are vio- lently tugged in the longitudinal direction (produced by the shortening of the heart in its contracted state), and this exists as far as several ramifications from the heart (d'd'). A movement in the opposite direction takes place at the diastole, which is doubtless as- sisted by the elasticity of the vessels restoring them to their former length. This circum- stance, moreover, proves the complete con- tinuity of structure of this organ with the small vessels which furnish the blood upon which it contracts. I have seen this best when the tail has been cut from the body,— the bloodless heart still going on contracting. I have failed altogether to find any lym- phatics going to this pulsating organ ; and the facts which I have already adduced, that it receives blood from behind, and transmits it forwards ; the large aggregate quantity of fluid which it propels in a given time ; the rhyth- mical tension of the capillary veins, attached to the distal end, at each contraction, as well as the apparent absence of lymphatics, seem to prove that it is a blood, and not a lymph, heart. * Hall's Essay on the Circulation, p. 172. | Loc, cit. II. Physical and Vital Properties.— As it regards the physical properties of veins, it may be remarked that their walls are thin as contrasted with arteries of the same calibre, those of the upper extremity being less than those of the lower; they are somewhat looser in texture, especially externally, and more extensile in the transverse direction — are distensible, and when distended they do not readily return to their former dimensions ; both circumstances being due, in a great measure, to the general longitudinal direction of their fibres : according to Soemmering the resisting power of veins diminishes with advancing age. The walls of veins are elastic, though less so than arteries, which pre-eminently exhibit that quality. The extreme thinness and slight physical resistance of veins is the cause why they collapse when empty. An empty vein presents very fine longi- tudinal rugae on its inner surface. The tissue of veins is less distinctly yellow than arteries, and frequently is stained of a pinkish colour by the blood in contact with it. Though their physical properties are, for the most part, of a negative character, they nevertheless possess the property of tenacity to a great degree, and are at least as strong as arteries of the same capacity, though the substance of the latter is so much more con- siderable. Ligature applied to a vein produces a longi- tudinal folding of the walls, which is very ap- parent when the vessel .is laid open after it has been tied. An indentation is produced across the inner surface of the vessel at the line of ligature, caused by the complete or partial rupture of its thin inner, longitudinal, fibrous tunic. But the entire thickness of the wall appears to have undergone a partial cut, as though one element of the compound mass of which it is composed had been divided while the rest remained entire ; and it would seem probable that a ligature applied tightly around a vein would divide the crisp yellow elastic tissue, while the tenacious white fibrous element, with which it is mixed, would remain entire. This probable expla- nation I have found, upon microscopical ex- amination, to be correct; the two parts, there- fore, of a vein that has been ligatured, are held together by the white fibrous tissue that enters into the constitution of its walls.* Vital Properties of Veins. — I am not aware of any experiments which have been directed to decide the amount of sensibility possessed by veins : it is probably, judging from anato- mical grounds, exceedingly low. As regards vital contractility, it has been a matter of dispute whether veins possess that property or not. Soemmering held them to possess it in an eminent degree, especially under the influence of chemical stimuli, wh ist * For some beautiful illustrations of ligatured veins, I would refer to Cooper and Travers's Sur- gical Essays, vol. i. plate 12.1385 VEIN. Haller * denies that they are endowed with irritability. It is now placed beyond all ques- tion that veins are endowed with vital contrac- tility, and that it exists in them in two distinct and entirely separate forms — first, as a rhyth- mical contraction, similar to what occurs in the cardiac cavities ; and secondly, as that peculiar slow and prolonged contraction which is known as tonicity, and which in so striking a degree exists, and exists alone, in arteries, — the former occurring in a small portion of the venous track, the latter pervading nearly the entire venous system. To the establishment of this last physiological fact, we are mainly indebted to Professor KoUiker. Venous rythmical contraction in man and mammalia generally occurs only in the im- mediate neighbourhood of the heart, but in cold-blooded animals it extends a considerable distance along the venous trunks. Flourensf was the first to describe it in the frog, where it has frequently been since witnessed ; and Miiller has observed that the venous trunks of the frog continue to contract even after the removal of the heart and the auricle. Nysten has witnessed contraction of the upper part of the vena cava in fish ; and Wedemeyer has observed the same in other cold-blooded animals. According to Miiller the rhythm of the veins in frogs occurs just previous to that of the auricle, and the rhythm of the auricle before that of the ventricle, and the rhythm of the aortic bulb follows the ventricular: there are four successive con- tractions, of which that of the veins is the first. In mammalia the venous contraction is almost synchronous with the auricular. I have frequently witnessed it in vivisect animals—rabbits, kittens, &c. ; and it exists in the pulmonary veins as well as in the cavpe. It is only in the immediate neigh- bourhood of the auricles that the veins contract, doubtless just so far as the cardiac muscle is prolonged into the venous tissues. The rhythm appears to commence upon the vein and pass forward upon the auricle. This vascular rhythm, existing in a high degree in the lower vertebrata, and diminishing in the higher, would appear, in man, to be the last remnant of the tubular heart seen in the in vertebrata. It appears very probable that the contrac- tion of the veins close to the auricles may be of assistance in the economy of the heart's action. If it be recollected that the auriculo- venous orifices are not guarded by valvular apparatus, it will be difficult to explain how, when the auricles contract, the blood is pre- vented from flowing back into the patent veins : may not this be prevented to a certain extent by the contraction of the veins, which thus constitute a sort of sphincter ? This rhythmical action of the veins must in no way be confounded with that peculiar venous * Sec. Mem. sur les part, sensibles et irritables : and Elem. Phys. lib. ii. p. 126. and lib. vi. p. 125. f In Annales des Sciences Natur. torn, xxviii. p. 65. pulsation which exists in certain forms of disease. Venous tonicity has lately been esta- blished by Kolliker*, and his physiological ex- periments have been based upon and fortified by the most conclusive anatomical discovery —viz. the demonstration of unstriped muscu- lar fibre in the walls of veins. Professor Kolliker's experiments were made upon the veins of a leg immediately after amputation; and the agent of muscular excitation was an electromagnetic apparatus. " The vena saphena minor was touched in the fossa poplitea, on the lower part of the leg and on the foot; the vena saphena magna on the lower part of the leg and dorsum pedis. A few seconds after the application of the wire, contraction took place ; at the end of a minute the parts touched contracted so much, that the blood that they contained in large quantities was pressed out, until the vessel had the appearance of a white cord. On smaller veins of the skin, the effect was not so rapid or so powerful." " Three applications of the wire had no effect on the vena poplitea, but it was already very flaccid and empty before the experiment. The vena tibialis postica was empty by con- traction in a minute." The irritability endured in the veins for an hour and fifteen minutes, being somewhat longer than in the arteries and lymphatics, and shorter than in the muscles. This contractile power in veins is of that peculiar character which has long been known to exist in arteries : it is slow, gradual, and persistent, and by it the vessel is braced up and set at a given calibre. This contractility, combined with the elasticity of the vessel's walls, is the antagonist to the distending force of the blood within the vessel. I have frequently noticed in animals ex- amined during life, that the large venous trunks are of greater calibre than when viewed after death : that whilst the blood flows on through the vessel, it is distended to a larger size than when from exudation and other causes the quantity of distending fluid is diminished; just as at each jet of blood pass- ing through an artery the tube is distended, in opposition to its contracted state after death,—the explanation being undoubtedly this, that immediately after death the vein- muscle becomes affected with cadaveric rigidity, and this being unopposed by the distending blood, contracts the vessel" to a calibre less than that which it could hold whilst the contraction was opposed by the distending force of the circulating fluid. The same thing occurs more distinctly in arteries, and, whilst the rigor mortis remains in ac- tivity, forms a powerful opponent to injections. III. General Remarks upon Veins Origin ; Course ; Anastomoses ; Plex- uses, &c. — General considerations of veins are to be made principally in relation to arte- * Kolliker and Siebold's Zeitschrift. 1849.VEIN. 1386 l ies, in contrast with which the characteristics of the former are most conspicuous. The general, the pulmonary, and the portal venous systems may be looked upon as the roots of a tree, the trunks of which would correspond with the auricles and the porta ; or they may be viewed as three cones, the bases of which are the capillaries of each system, and the apices, the auricles, and the porta. In either view, the veins are to be examined, in their track intermediate between these two points, as to their number, size, relation, and modes of dividing and junction. These observations will be carried solely as far as they refer to the general circulation, and that principally as it affects the human subject ; the pulmonary and the portal sys- tems being more properly considered in con- junction with those viscera with which they are connected. The venous system is far more extensive than the arterial, both as it regards size and number of vessels. Attempts have been made by different ana- tomists to estimate the relative size of arteries and veins, though it is difficult to see upon what data any thing like an exact calculation can be based ; nevertheless, Sauvages states the capacity of veins, as compared with arteries, to be as nine to four, Haller as two to one, and Borelli as four to one. Though it may be impossible to say which of these is the true estimate, it is ob- vious that the disparity between the two sets of vessels is very great. In the extremities and head, indeed everywhere but in the vis- cera, the veins form two distinct sets, the superficial, subcutaneous, veins, and the deep veins accompanying the arteries. These lat- ter, which are called satellite veins (vena comites),ave almost always double—two veins accompanying each artery of the same name. " This rule, however, has some exceptions; in fact there is only one accompanying vein for most of the great arterial trunks, and even for some arteries of moderate size ; lastly, in some few instances there is but one vein to two arte- ries. Thus, there is only one superior and one inferior mesenteric, one renal, and one external iliac, vein, each of which corresponds to the artery of the same name ; but there is only one umbilical vein to two umbilical arte- ries, and there are several suprarenal arteries, but only one suprarenal vein." (GruveMhier.*) These exceptions, however, are not suffi- ciently numerous to alter the ditiuse and branching character of veins. The following apposite quotation upon this head is from Meckel: — "It is a universal law with veins, that the branches or ramifications are larger in comparison with the trunks than in the arterial system; the veins of a part, or even of the whole body, never uniting themselves to so small a number of stems as those out of which the arteries take their origin. The aorta and pulmonary artery originate as single stems out of the respective cavities of the heart; the systemic veins, on the contrary, terminate in three trunks, the superior and inferior cava? and the coronary vein ; more- over, the superior cava receives, but just be- fore its entrance into the heart, a fourth trunk — the azygos vein. The pulmonary veins terminate in four, five, or even six trunks into the left auricle. Again, in the extremities, — take the arm, for instance,— where there is but a single artery, there are four considerable venous trunks. Thus divi- sion is the character of the arrangement of the veins ; contratension that of the arrangement of the arteries." (Meckel, Handbuch der mensehlichen Anatomic, Band i. S. 201.) Origin of Feins.—Veins originate, almost without exception, by the capillaries uniting — increasing in size, and diminishing in num- ber. This fact has been known, and all but universally received, since the days of Mal- pighi, who (in 1661) demonstrated, by micro- scopical research, that portion of Harvey's system of the circulation which had not been displayed, — the passage of the blood inter- mediately between the arteries and veins,— the capillaries, — and thereby explained the origin of the veins. That veins originate only by capillaries has also been generally ad- mitted ; but Haller has described absorbent veins as arising from all free surfaces ; and Cruveilhier speaks of veins commencing with open mouths on the surface of all mucous membranes; opinions long since refuted. There appear, however, to be some excep- tions to this general rule of capillary origin of veins. Thus, the veins which return the blood from certain portions of erectile tissue would seem to commence as little venous caverns or sacs, into which blood is poured by arteries of a size much above capillary vessels. (^Valentin: Midler?) Mr. Paget has recently pointed out another mode of venous origin as occurring in the wing of the bat (fTesperlilio), where arteries of comparatively considerable size pass at once into veins without intermediate capil- laries. Mr. Paget observes : " Very gene- rally the arteries of the second and third order of branches pass into veins of corre- sponding size without any intermedium of capillaries. The capillaries are rather in the position of offsets from the continuous chan- nels of arterial and venous loops, than in their more ordinary relation as intermediate canals leading from arteries to veins."* Further research, especially in comparative anatomy, will probably exhibit other instances of pecu- liar venous origin. Course, Anastomoses, Plexuses, Sfc. of Veins. — In travelling from their commencement to their termination, veins follow very various courses, the most marked differences indi- cating a division into thote which accompany their corresponding arteries, and those which pursue an independent course; a division which corresponds, with a few exceptions, to the deep and the superficial veins. In commencing, the veins form networks of * Lectures on Inflammation, by James Paget, F.R.C.S., in Medical Gazette, vol. xlv. p. t)G8.VEIN. J 387 vessels, which unite and reunite till they form venous trunks, which then take a more or less direct route to the heart. The deep veins accompany the correspond- ing arteries, and pursue the same course as these latter vessels, having similar relations with the bones, muscles, nerves, and fascia;: they are moreover surrounded by the same sheath of condensed areolar tissue as the arteries. It is remarkable, as has been ob- served by Cruveilhier, that the relative posi- tion of the two kinds of vessels, although constant, does not seem to follow any general rule ; all attempts to ascertain any law by which the relations of the veins with the arteries are regulated have been unsuccessful. In some situations deep veins do not take the same course as the corresponding arteries. This is the case with those of the nervous system (the cranial sinuses and spinal veins), the hepatic vein, the ophthalmic vein, the azygos vein, &e. The superficial or subcutaneous veins follow an independent course, as respects arteries,and accompany the cutaneous nerves and lympha- tics in the interval between the muscular apo- neuroses and the skin. The anastomoses of veins, and the plexuses formed thereby, are abundant and elaborate. The inosculations are more numerous than those of* arteries, and occur by means of much larger vessels. They take place " by direct inosculation, by lateral, transverse, or oblique, communications, and anastomoses by con- vergence, which are found in every situation and with all conceivabie varieties. The branches of the veins form lozenge-shaped meshes ; and both the trunks and the branches communicate freely with each other ; that is to say, the superficial with the deep set, the veins of the superficial set and those of the deep set amongst each other, and the vena cava superior with the vena cava infe- rior : so that we may say that the whole ve- nous system forms one vascular network ; and it is by these free communications that such obstacles as impede or completely inter- cept the course of the blood in a given part are rendered incapable of stopping it alto- gether." ( Cruveilk icr.) The anastomoses are so numerous and complete, that it is almost impossible to inter- cept the venous circulation by the interrup- tion even of vessels of considerable size: if even the superior cava with the venae innomi- nate be interrupted, the blood will be re- turned— finding its way back to the heart by the anastomoses of the internal mammary, the acromio-thoracic veins, &c. with the inter- costal, azygos, and epigastric veins — so taking the blood back by means of the inferior cava. An obstruction of the inferior cava is com- pensated for by the same set of vessels, the blood going then in the other direction.* Obstruction to the portal circulation does not absolutely stop the blood : inosculations oc- cur between the portal and general systems * See Morbid Anatomy. of veins in the haemorrhoidal plexus sufficient to maintain the blood-current. These are some of the special examples of anastomoses; the general method of inoscu- lation also requires some explanation. For example, a vein arises in conjunction with another collateral vein, or takes its origin from the latter, and after having pursued a course of various length, again joins the prin- cipal vein. Instances of this may be seen in the various veins of the extremities. A venous trunk may divide jx QCO . . P . . ■ ■ i 1 >s. soy. into two of equal size, which separate at a very acute angle, and, after an elliptical interval, again unite into one. Such may frequently be observed in the saphcena. Cross anastomoses, by means of large veins uniting those on the opposite sides of the body, are not unfrequent. Such are the circular sinus and the basilar sinus, in the skull, the azygos, and the intercostal veins, &c. A vein, just before its junction with the trunk to which it is tributary, divides into two, and joins at different parts — an oc- casional variety of the frontal vein. The plexuses of veins are merely a high degree of anasto- mosis : they are not subservient to any laws in their formation and arrangement, or susceptible of any systematic division ; and will probably be best under- stood by describing and figur- ing a few of the most charac- teristic. The simplest and most primi- tive form of plexus is that which is produced by the inosculations and joinings of two vena: comites around and across an artery. Such is exhibited in the accom- panying figure : the anastomoses are so numerous, that it is diffi- cult to tell in parts whether they are to be considered as two vessels, or as one, with fre- quent trivial interruptions of cavity : at some points they run a considerable distance without conjunction,leaving an elongated elliptical interval ; and at other points 'their confluence is so great that the intervals are re- duced to small circular apertures on the face of one broad vein. A coarser and more compli- cated form of plexus is exhibited in the subcutaneous system of veins, in the production of which t- , 1 i . . rente mites several venous trunks combine, Spermatic*. and by their lateral branchings (afterBreschet.) and confluxes produce diamond- shaped, rhomboidal, and triangular inter-1388 VEIN. Spaces : — these anastomoses being all on But the most elaborate and complex of all the same plane, excepting at a few points the plexuses in the human* subject are here and there where a small channel dips those formed around, about, and within, down to the deep veins. Such plexuses may the spinal canal: they are composed of nu- be seen on the dorsum of the hand and foot. merous trunks, w hich unite, divide, and re- unite, at every possible point, and in all con- ceivable modes, by branches of all sizes, lengths, and shapes, and leave intervals pre- senting forms of endless variety. A portion of these plexuses, seen in the accompanying figure, from Breschet's work on the veins, conveys a better idea of them than any lengthened description. The diploic plexuses are the net-works of veins which exist in and among the cancel- lated tissue of the bones. In the flat bones of the cranium, at the period of adult life, they form large irregular meshes, by the mean- derings of large, irregular, ampullated, veins. These vessels are very unequal in size, are subject to dilatations, and frequently end in culs-de-sac. They are well represented in figs. 187. and 188. Vol. I. But the most re- markable peculiarity in these plexur-es, is the change they undergo during osseous de- velopment. In early foetal life, when ossifi- cation commences the cranial bones consist of stellae of numerous ossifie rays, the inter- spaces between them being occupied by hosts of small, almost straight, radiating, veins: these veins are not covered in by osseous structure, but are exposed on both surfaces of the bone (fig. 872.); they then gradually become tortuous, and fuse into one another, so as to diminish in number, and lose much of their radiating character ; and after a time they become covered by a thin plate of bone on either surface. The process of fusion and dilatation of the veins still goes on during life, and ultmately leaves the diploic plexus, consisting of a few large vessels. Diploic vessels exist in all cancellated bone in various plexiform combinations.

Function of Veins. — In function veins may be considered as having a triple office : they are passive organs of circulation ; they are diverticula or reservoirs for blood ; and they are agents of absorption. Circulation in the veins consists of the passive and equable transmission of blood along their tubes. " When we consider the great size of the veins, compared with the arteries, we must conclude that the blood flows but slowly in the venous system ; that, from the narrowness of the trunks of the veins near the heart, the blood must be ac- celerated as it approaches the heart ; and that receiving the impulse from the ventricle, it must take a rapid course through the arteries, until, again approaching the extreme branches of the arteries, and passing into the veins, its motion becomes more languid and slow. In youth, as the size of the veins is not in so great a proportion to the arteries as in advanced life, the blood must be in more rapid circulation : but in old age, owing to the largeness of the veins and the accu- mulation of blood in them, it moves slowly through the venous system, and is almost stagnant in the dilated veins and in the sinuses. " There is no pulsation to be observed in the veins, but what they receive from con- tiguous arteries. There is no pulsation in the veins because they are removed from the heart; because they do not receive the shock of the heart's action in their trunk, but only by their widely-spread branches ; because the contraction of the heart and of the arteries so alternate with each other, as to keep up a perpetual and uniform stream of blood into the veins." (Sir C. Bell's Anatomy, vol. ii. p. 284.) As diverticula and reservoirs of blood the veins must be considered as performing a most important service in the oeconomy of the cir- culation. There are numerous circumstances both in health and disease which either tem- porarily or permanently disturb the balance of the circulation, and thereby displace and choke up large quantities of blood ; and, were it not for the reservoirs, diverticula, and lateral compensating channels, which are afforded by large, bulging, and dilatable veins, by the enor- mous area of the common venous cavity, and by the numerous and elaborate inosculations and plexuses which these vessels every where exhibit, such interruptions might lead to consequences, permanent, irremediable and destructive. The whole subcutaneous system of veins must be looked upon as a series of compen- satory channels. The cavities of the deep veins are quite sufficient to return the blood that is sent to them by vessels of smaller aggregate calibre. But during muscular ex- ertion, &c, these deep vessels are impeded by pressure, and then the blood finds a colla- teral route by means of the subcutaneous veins. So again, when from cold, or other causes, the skin-muscle contracts and presses on the cutaneous veins they are more or less emptied, and their office is resumed by the deep veins : they thus keep up a mutual reciprocation of function. The large internal veins of the body; theVEIN. 1390 dilatations of the veins at the base of the brain ; the large amount of veins in the parenchymatous viscera ; the venous plexuses of the spinal canal, together with the venous cells and tubes in the cancellated tissue of all bones, form a series of diverticula and reser- voirs, equal to all emergencies*, where the blood may slowly flow, or recede, or stagnate. But the most striking examples of venous re- servoirs are furnished by comparative anatomy. All those animals which have diving habits subject themselves to peculiar disturbance of circulation. The prolonged stoppage of re- spiration, but still more the immense pressure of water to which they are exposed, when deeply submerged, mechanically empties all the superficial veins and produces much deep- seated and visceral congestion. This is com- pensated for by a special arrangement. In diving birds there is great dilatation of the posterior vena cava. In the Grebes and Divers (■Podiceps and Cotymbus) the posterior cava is largely dilated in the liver and below, extend- ing to opposite the kidneys. In the Cetacea, which are subject to the same influence, enormous dilatable venous plexuses, placed within the abdominal cavity, perform the same office. Venous absorption probably occurs wherever veins exist, but especially in the alimentary canal, where, in conjunction with the lacteals, they perform the important office of extracting from the food the different materials which enter the circulation and nourish the various tissues of the body. It is not my intention to enter upon any of the elaborate arguments or disquisitions on the evidence of venous absorption. I shall content myself with a brief summary of the most im- portant salient points. That absorption by the veins takes place independently of the lacteals has been proved by a series of conclusive experiments conducted by Tiedemann and Gmelin")", who administered to a number of animals various substances of distinct and easily recognisable physical and chemical properties, and afterwards analysed the venous blood, the secretions, and the chyle. Substances having deep colours, such «s cochineal, indigo, litmus, gamboge ; sub- stances having strong odours — turpentine, assafeetida, garlic, musk — and saline sub stances, such as sulphate of iron, chloride of barium, ferro-cyanide and sulpho-cyanide of potassium, were all in turn submitted to ex- periment. Almost all of these matters were found in the venous blood, several of them in the urine, and a few only of the latter (the sa- line substances) in the chyle. Therefore it ap- pears that absorption did take place, in many instances, independently of the lacteals, and * Not literally equal to all emergencies: the great deep-seated congestion caused in the cold stage of an ague-fit has ruptured the vena cava: the same has occurred in violent muscular exertion. f Versuche tiber d.

This conclusion is fortified by other experiments conveying both positive and negative evidence, which have been performed by Majendie, Blake, Delille, Sega- las, &c. Majendie and Delille in conjunction per- formed the following experiment. They severed all the parts of the posterior extremity of a dog, excepting the artery and vein by which the circulation of the" limb was kept up. They then introduced some upas poison into the foot; and in ten minutes the animal died. It cannot be imagined here that the lymphatics absorbed the poison, as they were divided; but it may be objected that the matter was mechanically introduced into the divided extremities of the vessels in the wound. This difficulty has been over- come in another experiment devised by Ma- jendie. He found that death was caused by the introduction of nux vomica into the intes- tine of an animal in which the lacteals had been tied, where the veins, by which alone absorption could here take place, remained entire. An experiment exactly the reverse of the last was performed by Segalas, which completely bore out the idea of venous ab- sorption. Instead of tying the lacteals and leaving the veins untied, Segalas tied the veins, the lacteals remaining unimpaired. The result ;vas, that when poison was applied to the intestine, no absorption took place, and no result followed. It was further found by Mr. Blake, that ligature of the vena porta prevented the action of poisons introduced into the stomach. V. Development of Veins. — Are the veins, large and small, originally developed as capillaries, the succeeding changes by which their texture and size are modified taking place subsequently to their being permeable sanguiferous channels ? Whether this is en- tirely the case is doubtful: that it is so to some extent is certain; and therefore the development of veins would involve two con- siderations — first, the development of capil- laries, and secondly, those after-changes by which the vessels cease to be capillaries, and become, in texture and volume, true veins. The arguments in favour of the view that veins are developed primarily as capillaries, are—that veins, arteries, and capillaries con- stitute one continuous system, which renders a community of development antecedently probable ; that arteries and veins are so similar in structure as evidently to possess a common development, which heightens the probability of their development being the same as their connecting link; that the part possessed by capillaries — basement mem- brane — is that which we see in other parts capable of giving rise to fresh structures ; that we see all stages between the largest veins and capillaries filled up without a gap; that structures which in an early stage are furnished only with capillaries, and vessels a little removed from them, are found shortlyVEIN. 1391 to contain veins, and that the venous textures become more strongly marked as the parts become more mature ; and that veins but little removed in size from capillaries, differ from them by the addition of structures exactly similar in nature to those which larger veins possess in a greater amount. The development of capillaries has been ob- served, principally, by Schwann* in the tails of young tadpoles, and the germinal mem- brane of an incubated hen"s egg, by Kollikerf, in the tails of batrachian larvae generally, and by Paget % in the foetal membranes of sheep. Their accounts, which my own observations on the tails of batrachian larvae entirely con- firm, all substantially agree. On subjecting the tail of a very young tad- pole to microscopical observation, and viewing it with an object glass of a quarter of an inch focal distance, it wilfbe seen that the vessels possess all the characteristics of very fine capil- laries, that is, they possess a delicate, perfectly homogeneous membrane, with nuclei adhering here and there to its internal surface. The two great arterial and venous trunks are elongated posteriorly, as the larvae grow, by throwing out prolongations, which, by joining the embryonic cells accumulated about the extremity of the chorda dorsalis, inoscidate with them so as to form a continuous cavity. The first lateral vessels of the tail, which have the form of simple arcs going from artery to vein, are formed by the junction of pro- longations, from the caudal artery and vein, with certain elongated or stellate cells in the substance of the tail. From these vessels, which constitute what may be called the pri- mary arches,are thrown out projections which, by inosculating in an exactly similar way with neighbouring stellate cells, form secondary capillary arches; and thus the capillary net- work continually extends itself in proportion as the tail gets longer and broader, and at the same time becomes more dense by the forma- tion of new vessels between the primitive meshes. Such are the general appearances seen in the tail of any of the batrachian larvae. These, however, Schwann does not consider so con- clusive as the appearances in the germinal membrane of a hen's egg. He says that when the germinal membrane of a hen's egg which has been subjected to thirty-six hours' incuba- tion, is placed under the microscope, and the area pellucida examined with a magnifying power of 4o0, the capillary vessels are readily distinguished in it. In some situations they are perfect, and connected with the larger vessel, some are of irregular calibre, having bulgings here and there where two or three channels meet, the intervening portions vary- ing in size from that of a fibre of yellow fibrous tis ue to the full capillary diameter, and permeable to blood or not. * Microscopical Researches, translated for the Sydenham Society, by Henry Smith. f Annales des Sciences Naturelles. August, 18J6. j Supplement to Midler's Elements of Physiology, by Drs. Baly and Kirkes. In addition to these capillaries, which form a network of channels of irregular calibre, and give off blind branches, some separate irregular corpuscles are seen which are not connected with the vascular network. These bodies send off blind processes, of various forms, in different directions ; in other words, they are stellate cells. They have a reddish- yellow colour, like that of the capillaries of bone, which circumstance alone would be suf- ficient to make it probable that they are the primary cells of capillaries in process of forma- tion; and this probability becomes a certainty when we perceive that some of these same stellate cells are already connected with the true capillaries, forming with them a common cavity. This is Schwann's description. Of its correctness I cannot speak from my own observation, but of the correctness and ex- treme truthfulness of Kolliker's account of the same process in the tails of young batra- chia I can, from my own observations, con- fidently speak : indeed he has left nothing to be added. Morbid Anatomy of Veins. Veins are subject to a variety of morbid changes, which are naturally incident to blood vessels of their particular organisation and functions, occasioning a remarkable contrast in their pathology with that of arteries. Thus veins are much more subject to diffuse inflammation than arteries, and the products of their inflammation being carried in the blood to the heart, are conveyed all over the body ; they moreover offer peculiar facilities for the introduction of morbid materials into the cir- culation, and from both these circumstances wide-spread and diffuse disease is the result— conditions which have no parallel as the conse- quence of arterial disease. Again, an injury to a vein, such as a punctured wound,is followed by- cicatrization ; and any dilatation of its tube interferes only partially with its functions; whereas in an artery, from the vigorous and pulsating character of the circulation in it, a wound is only to be healed by obliteration of the vessel, and any dilatation of it causes an aneurism — a progressive and destructive disease. From the time of Hippocrates, some of the diseases of veins—varix and haemorrhoids — have been recognised ; but it was not till John Hunter, in 1793, published his paper on the diseases of veins in the "Transactions of a Society for the Improvement of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge," that any light was thrown upon that most important of these diseases — phlebitis. Since then the subject has received a large share of attention at the hands of some of our most distinguished pathologists : and Hodg- son, Travers, Breschet, Bovillainl, Ribers, Ar- nott, Lee, and hosts of others, have all added their quota towards its elucidation. The diseases of veins divide themselves into phlebitis, with which may be considered the effects of wounds and ligatures; varix and1392 VEIN. hemorrhoids ; rupture ; disease of valves ; jjh/e- bohtcs ; calcareous degeneration ; fatty tumours ; entozoa. Phlebitis. — Phlebitis may be conveniently divided into plastic and suppurative. They, however, frequently exist together, are pro- duced by the same cause, or give rise to each other. Veins possess peculiar facilities for the pro- duction of certain of their diseases, especially inflammation of their lining membrane, caused by the introduction of morbid materials into their cavities ; which is a very general cause of the disease now under consideration. They are peculiarly subject to being opened, on account of their superficial position, and their being submitted to the surgical opera- tion of venesection ; and it must be remem- bered how large a superficies of the venous cavity is exposed at every parturition to the contact of those fluids which are secreted in the healing of the placental wound. The veins si- tuated in the osseous tissues present peculiar facilities for the introduction of morbid mat- ters into the circulation, on account of the patency of their cut extremities, caused by the adhesion of their walls to the unyielding tissue in which they are embedded. Again, the di- rection ofe th current of the circulation to- wards the heart, is not likely to expel any materials that are introduced into the vein, but would rather tend to carry them on into the mass of the circulating fluid. The absorbing function of veins is often re- ferred to as a cause of the introduction of morbid matters into the circulation, and this especially as it regards pus, but it cannot be strictly said that pus is absorbed in cases of purulent phlebitis ; and I apprehend that the distinction laid down by Hunter*, on this point, is perfectly correct. It appears to me impossible for any one acquainted with the structure of the coats of blood-vessels, and the anatomy of a pus-cell, to imagine that pus, as such, can be introduced within a vein by any process analogous to absorption. It is true that pus may enter a vein bodily, and as pus ; and it is equally true that pus may be absorbed ; but the former is by introduction through some lesion in the vessel's walls, and in the latter the fluid is in some way altered be- fore it can pass through the tunics of the vein, if, indeed, a vein be here the agent of absorp- tion. When pus is absorbed, as from a bubo, or in empyema, it is attended with a different series of symptoms and consequences from those which arise when it is introduced bodily, and pus is, in these cases, not to be found in the veins ; and it must be remembered that all the circumstances — a wound secreting pus and an open vein, or, what is tantamount to the same, such inflammation of a vein as leads to secretion of pus in its cavity, — are uniformly present where the characteristic results of phlebitis occur. The same thing is imitated by injecting pus into the veins—with like results. Plastic phlebitis bears the same relation to * On the Blood, p 3G0. suppurative, that the two forms of inflamma- tion hold relatively to other organs. Plastic phlebitis indicates a form of disease of milder character, and consummated with results of less severity. Suppurative phlebitis is more or less mixed up with the plastic form, and is generally secondary to it. When a vein undergoes inflammation, the affected portion throughout its entire thick- ness becomes of a diffused red, which is not, at this stage, to be distinguished from the red stain produced by contact of the blood, ob- servable, under certain circumstances, in both arteries and veins ; this fades at the edges of the inflamed portion. As the disease advances, the part becomes irregularly mottled of all shades, from purple to the natural colour of the part; with this appears, in the areolar tissue of the veins, an effusion of sanious serum. The effusion does not end in a serous exudation; but, as the disease progresses, a plastic effusion is exhibited, not only in the tissue of the vein, but also within its cavity. Whether or not the previously developed serous effusion also escapes in part upon the free surface of the lining membrane of the vein, is not easily de- termined, but in the stage now under con- sideration it probably does so, as in other serous inflammation. At all events, at or im- mediately after the time when such effusion occurs, the tube of the vein becomes blocked up with a coagulum of blood: this does not occur at once, but progressively, beginning by the deposition of fibrine upon the inflamed surface, which deposition is increased by suc- cessive layers, the original being for the most part the most compact, until the entire tube is blocked up. That part of this fibrinous product is formed by the serous lining of the veins, — secreted from the vasa vasorum, — is proved beyond all question by the experiments of Gendrin and Hope. Gendrin found that, by securing a portion of a vein between two liga- tures and removing all the blood it contained, upon injecting some irritating substance into it, plastic lymph was exuded in sufficient quantity to fill the cavity of the insulated por- tion.* In this experiment the fibrinous matter was clearly true plastic lymph, in all respects similar to the plastic effusion in other serous cavities. Again, the experiments of Dr. Hope, in which, by mechanical irritation, he pro- duced warty excrescences on the valve of the aorta, support the view I have taken. There are many points in the formation of these coagula in veins which are remarkable. That they do, as already stated, consist both of lymph-exudation and coagulated blood is more than probable. But what determines the coagu- lation of the blood in plastic phlebitis, is less obvious. That the inherent power of coagu- lation, which the blood in itself possesses, is the cause, is not saying enough. There are * The experiments were originally performed upon arteries, but were repeated upon veins with similar results. Dr. Hope's were upon the aorta near the heart: however, they prove the same fact — effusion of lymph on the lining of the vascular cavity.VEIN. 1393 certain conditions which must occur before coagulation can develop itself. While the blood, itself in a state of health, remains in contact with the lining membrane of healthy blood vessels, coagulation is impossible; but under certain conditions of disease the blood loses its fluidity, and these conditions may either consist in some abnormality of the ves- sel's walls, or in some foreign matters becom- ing mixed with the blood,—the former in- fluence being passive, and the latter an active agent in producing or hastening coagulation. I would here urge the doctrine that the vascular cavity,—the hollows of all the tubu- lar vessels (veins, arteries, and lymphatics), together with the ventricles and auricles of the heart, — constitutes a true serous shut sac, much complicated in form and modified by its peculiar functions, it is true ; but pos- sessing the, same anatomical elements, — an epithelial pavement placed upon a sheet of limitary tissue, on the other side of which is situated a nutrient vascular system. 1 would here urge this view, because it applies with much force to certain questions in venous pathology, and to few more so than the one under consideration, where arguments by analogy are a desideratum. The lining mem- brane of the veins then is a serous membrane. On the surface of other serous membranes — pleura, pericardium, &c.—plastic effusion con- sists of sheets of lymph, and a certain amount of serum. By analogy we, a priori, conclude that lymph is effused in inflammation on the lining surface of the veins, and this the experi- ments of Gendrin and Hope have established by indisputable proof. That the inflammatory product consists partly of serum as well as lymph is supported by analogy alone ; but if admitted would explain the coagulation of the blood to complete the clot, which is known to be so much facilitated by the ad- mixture of foreign or abnormal secretions. Whatever may be the opinion of the forma- tion of the coagulum, its characters are these : — it consists of concentric lamina?, brownish, yellowish, or white, of which the central are the darkest and softest; and sometimes the centre is nearly fluid blood. The density of the entire clot is subject to much variety. The coagulum is moulded to the cavity of the vein, and sometimes prebent the exact impression of the valves. Mr. Arnott has made an interesting observation with respect to the coagulum, that it extends along the affected vein usu- ally to the next collateral branch, and there abruptly ceases. The true explanation of this circumstance is doubtless that given by Mr. Henry Lee.* " When any portion of a vein is obstructed, the blood is kept at rest between the obstruction and the next collateral branch ; and, if disposed to coagu- late, there is nothing to interfere with such an action. But the case is different as soon as one vein opens into another. A fresh cur- rent of blood is then continually sweeping the * On Phlebitis and Purulent Deposits, by Henry Lee, Lond. 1800, p. 23. VOL. IV. orifice of the obstructed vessel; and even although the blood at this point should have a tendency to coagulate, it is carried on in the course of the circulation, before it can adhere to the sides of the unobstructed vein." The coagulum thus extends towards the heart, beyond the limits of the inflamed por- tion, having a mere mechanical boundary. It extends also at the distal end, but here it becomes gradually attenuated : it often rami- fies into many branches and subdivisions of the veins that are tributary to the one ob- structed, especially where they are not re- lieved by collateral anastomoses. At those points where inflammation has not occurred, and the coagulation has been favoured by me- chanical circumstances simply, the clot scarcely adheres to the lining membrane of the vein. But the plastic product is not always in the form of a plug, moulded to the cavity of the vein: it sometimes consists of shreds or fringes of lymph, firmly attached to the lining of the vein, and hanging into its cavity, either from the walls or in festoons from the valves.* The walls of the vein, at the same time, undergo change, indicative of the same inflam- matory phenomena, which consists mainly in interstitial plastic deposit among the areolar tissue of the tunics. " So soon as a fibrinous plug of this de- scription is established, the red and violet speckled colouring abates in intensity, and the internal membrane, losing its smoothness and polish, assumes a dull velvety or slightly puckered appearance. The external mem- brane appears thickened, turgid, and soon becomes adherent to the cellular tissue, which in its turn has been rendered firmer and paler from the effusion of plastic lymph. Both membranes are still readily distinguishable, and even separable, from each other; the con- sistency of their texture is however impaired, and they are easily torn. In this state of things a vein, w hen cut asunder, does not col- lapse, even after the plug has been removed ; but, on the contrary, its calibre remains open like that of an artery. This is more than ever the case when the surrounding cellular tex- ture has acquired firmness by the condensa- tion of the inflammatory product infused into it, or when it puts on a brawn-like character, and intimately coalesces with the external membrane of the vessel.-j- These phasnomena may occur in veins of any size ; and to any extent in anj ;,articular set of vessels. They occasion obstruction of the circulation in all vessels tributary to the one affected. Of such a condition Phlegmasia alba dolens may be instanced as an example. As regards the cause of plastic phlebitis, or, indeed, of venous inflammation in general, it may be the result either of spontaneous action, or the circulation of poisoned blood— the latter being infinitely the most common * See Cooper and Travers's Essays, Lond. 1818, part i. plate 10. t Hasse's Pathological Anatomy, Sydenham So • ciety's translation, Lond. 18-16, p. 13. 4 uVEIN. 1394 cause. In the latter case the inflammation of the vein is excited by contact of a coagu- lum of vitiated blood with the lining of the vessel. But the veins may, as well as other tissues and organs, be the seat of spontaneous inflammation. This is frequent in some forms of varix; especially in haemorrhoids, and usu- ally, though not always, leads to the coagu- lation of the contained blood. I have seen acute inflammation of a varicose saphena causing much interstitial plastic deposit, in which no coagulum formed in the interior of the vessel, whose canal was quite pervious. Suppurative Phlebitis.—When phlebitis leads to suppuration, it is generally, I bel eve always, accompanied by plastic effusion also. The question of pus formation within veins is one of great importance and interest, and difficult of solution. In a great proportion of examples, purulent phlebitis is originally lighted up by the mechanical introduction of pus into the veins. In some few cases the pus would seem to originate within the vein, either from an ulceration of the inner surface, or perhaps it is secreted free on the unbroken lining membrane. One very remarkable point is the enormous multiplication of the pus within the vein. No absorption, or me- chanical introduction, can at all explain the immense increase ; and it is obvious that there exists within the vessel some source of this pus generation. It was imagined by Gendrin and Donne that the blood itself was the source of the pus, and that it was developed by the metamorphosis of blood globules into pus cells ; and they imagined that the change of form to a sphere, which the blood discs un- dergo, when submitted to the action of certain fluids, was an indication of the change. This doctrine has, however, been long since ex- ploded. A more reasonable explanation, and one founded upon analogy, is that, the pus is se- creted by the inner surface of the vein, by a metamorphosis of epithelium. Vogel has long since demonstrated, on the mucous mem- branes, that pus is producible by a change of epithelial cells, and this suggests an explana- tion, — why, in an unbroken vessel, pus may be produced in great abundance. Wherever epithelium exists, it appears that pus cells may be generated without lesion of surface; espe- cially where the action is started by contact of pus from some other source. This certainly happens in serous cavities,—pleura, pericar- dium, &c.; and we may, from analogy, judge that the same occurs in veins. This' doctrine is entertained by the high authority of Basse : he observes, —" In accordance with these views, the puriform masses, generated within the veins, would be developed as follows : — First of all the cells of epithelium-lining dis- covered by Henle, separate from the internal membrane' of the vein, so as to give the inner surface of the vessel the dull appearance al- ready described, and to render it more sus- ceptible of a morbid tinge from imbibition. The next change affects the passing blood cor- puscles, which assume a spheroid or else a gibbous appearance, advance with a slow re- volving movement, or cling to one another, parting with their serum and with their pig- ment. The internal membrane of the vessel generates new imperfect epithelium cells, which mingle with the altered blood, and finally actual pus-globules, which, when con- gregated in sufficient number, completely ar- rest the current of the blood, and affect the blood-corpuscles in the manner already pointed out. The simultaneous effusion of both fibrin and albumen now serves to complete the formation of a plug, which differs in external characters according to its more or less rapid development, and to the varying proportions of its constituent parts. The plug, thus originat- ing, afterwards undergoes further changes."* The actual changes that occur, and are ob- vious to the naked eye, affect the plastic plug, the fluid contents, and the parietes of the vein. In suppurative as well as adhesive phlebitis, plugs of lymph and coagula are formed, and are partly the result of inflammatory action, and partly they are the direct result of the contact of fluid pus with the blood.f The plugs that form in suppurative phle- bitis are softer, more numerous, and vary in form. They soon become broken down, and exhibit disintegrated fibrin mixed with ge- nuine pus. The coagula become softened, first in the centre ; they loose their laminated structure, and ultimately break up. These coagula, in phlebitis the result of infected blood, must not be considered as any indica- tion of the locality in which the disease has originated. In such cases the whole circu- lating mass is infected : little portions of coagu- lating fibrin, entangling pus-cells, are con- tinually passing through the vessels, and here and there attaching themselves to the lining of the vessel, light up circumscribed regions of inflammation. This coagulation is a re- medial effort: by its means the materies morbi is shut up and circumscribed by a harmless coagulum: circulation in the affected vessel is suspended and the poison cannot again mix with the blood. Perhaps these coagula some- times become absorbed, or organised and ob- literate the vessel; at other times they sup- purate, and the walls of the vessel become implicated and ultimately give way. " The formation of matter being brought about with- in the inflamed vein, its membranes have like- wise to undergo a further change. Their colour now inclines to a greyish white ; they become softened and thickened, are no longer to be distinguished from one another, and form, in conjunction with the surrounding tex- tures, a nearly uniform membranous layer of * Hasse's Pathological Anatomy, p. 16. t The influence of pus in causing coagulation of the blood may be seen in the following experiment: — "An abscess was opened in the groin, and a quantity of pus received into a gallipot; some blood from the divided vessels was also received into the same vessel; they were then stirred together, and in two minutes the mass coagulated. Some blood taken from the same patient in the same manner, but not mixed with pus, coagulated in eleven and a half minutes."—Lee on Phlebitis, &c. p. 27.VEIN. 1395 a lardaceous aspect and Character. By and by a turbid puriform fluid is often found de- posited at intervals in the cellular texture ; ia some instances where the suppuration is vi- gorous in the vicinity of the vein, the latter traverses the purulent channel for a consider- able space, denuded of its entire circumfer- ence. Here the membranes of the vein gra- dually soften, and at length melt down, so to speak, until no further vestige of their texture is discernible within the common centre of suppuration."* If, however, this circumscrip- tion of the pus by means of eoagulum does not occur, and it floats through the vascular sys- tem, it produces a variety of secondary effects remarkable and important in their results. The products of this secondary action are known as " purulent deposits" or " lobular abscesses." Strictly speaking, they are not deposits of pus; but the pus is "translated" from one part to another, and there becomes the originator and centre of a fresh abscess. The actual mode of production of these lo- bular abscesses has been the subject of much discussion ; but the evidence upon the va- rious points appears to resolve itself into the following explanation. The pus-cells being bodily introduced into a vein, or generated in it, pass forward in the circulation till arrested in the capillaries by their size being too great to admit of their passage : they then excite inflammation of the parenchyma of the affected organ, which leads to condensation, and, sub- sequently, to suppuration : the pus-cells being the excitants of the inflammation, which is suppurative, not only from its intensity, but from the fact that pus germs are furnished by the same body as originates the inflammation, and thus more pus is generated. The appearances of these local abscesses, which are, strictly speaking, foreign to our present subject, are determined by the cha- racter of the organ in which they occur. There appears to be some general laws as it respects the development of these abscesses. They occur in those organs which are most vascular, and through which the largest quan- tity of blood passes in the smallest space of time; thus the lungs and liver are affected the most abundantly. Again, after the blood has been infected and the pus added to it, that system of capillaries is first affected, through which the fluid first passes; the capillaries, as it were, filtering off the pus-cells and retaining them. Thus, if pus gets into the systemic veins, the capillaries of the lungs will be the first to arrest their progress ; and when this happens, as is generally the case, lobular ab- scesses are most abundantly, or exclusively, found in those organs, and when found else- where also are most advanced in the lungs : when, however, the portal s\ stem is the vehicle of the pus, as occasionally happens after oper- ations on the rectum, for example, we find the abscesses in the liver. These laws are quite correct in the main ; but there are some ex- ceptions to them, and these exceptions are * Hasse, loc. cit. p. 18. quite explicable ; for though pus-cells are for the most part too large to pass capillaries, especially with their tendency to coagulate blood, they may nevertheless pass through some of the larger ones ; and it must be ad- mitted that disintegrated pus globules may pass through the smallest vessels : hence, in some instances, the laws here suggested are not exemplified. The results of phlebitis are either suppura- tion, resolution, or obstruction, the consequence of organisation of the effused lymph. Upon the latter subject some observations are ne- cessary. Obliteration of Veins.—Obliteration of veins, the result of phlebitis, may be either incom- plete or complete. Hasse mentions two forms of partial obliteration of veins ; the first of which has also been described by Carswell. This form consists of a thickened and turgid condition of the vessel's walls, as if they had been macerated; at the same time they are closely connected with the surrounding areo- lar ti.isue. Within the vein, and intimately connected with the lining membrane, is a hol- low cylinder of fibrin, firm and whitish on its exterior, and soft and dark-coloured within ; the interior being bathed with the circulating blood. Dr. Carswell's explanation of this, in which Hasse coincides, is that the soft centre of the plug is carried away before the circu- lating current, whilst the exterior becomes organised and united with the interior of the vein. In the other form he describes the vein as reduced to a whitish cord, and filled with an organised plug. " Betwixt this plug and the thickened coats of the vessel, round about the periphery of the former, were several little canals, which, running along the w hole extent of the vein, had already begun to re-establish the circulation. In all probability the impulse of the blood below had, during the first period of inflammation, here and there severed the plastic plug from the parietes of the vessel; subsequently, the above plug being organised, and the intervening blood absorbed, several peripheral channels w ould form, instead of a single central one." * In complete obliteration the vein diminishes in size, shrinks nearly to a cord, and becomes pale and soft. The plug also becomes reduced in size anil organised, and adheres firmly to the lining of the vein. How the plug re- ceives its vessels and communicates with the vasa vasorum of the vein, I am not prepared to state. But fibrin thus isolated probably has the inherent power of generating vessels, which ultimately communicate with those of neighbouring textures. The secondary con- sequences of obliteration of veins, — oedema, Phlegmasia dolens, &c. cannot here be con- sidered. Healing of Wounds in Veins. — The condi- tion of the wound and its mode of healing de- pend upon the character and direction of the * Hasse, loc. cit. p. 26. I beg to make abundant acknowledgments to the very valuable writings of this author, from whom I have drawn largely. 4 v 2139G VEIN. wound. If the wound be linear, and made in the axis of the vessel or somewhat ob- liquely, and there be not. much bleeding, its lips will come together, adhere, and rapidly form a linear cicatrix. If, however, it be transverse, or if much bleeding occur from it, a coagulum will form in and over the aperture. " An oval naked coagulum forms the plug of the orifice, and a flattened co- vered clot, which is an extravasation into the cellular sheath, extends to some distance around it."* In twenty-four hours the lips of the wound are found separated, the edges are everted and adhere to the clot. At the expiration of three days the internal margin of the wound is elevated and rounded, and a thin, narrow, membranous expansion, parti- ally extending over the inner surface of the clot, is seen to be continuous with the everted edge of the internal tunic. The clot is more compact and lamellated. At the fifth day the membranous appearance extends over the whole inner surface of the clot. Subsequently the clot becomes more and more absorbed, and the new membrane, extending from the lips of the wound, becomes more organ- ised. Vasa vasorum can be seen on it by means of a lens from the twelfth to the six- teenth day. " On the twentieth day it is only possible to distinguish the recent from former wounds, by the tenuity, smoothness, and transparency of the new membrane compared with the old, which is dense, tough, and wrinkled." These dates, &c. refer to the wounds made in ordinary bleeding operations; in larger wounds the process is proportion- ately longer. The wound is ever after indi- cated by the peculiar thin, transparent, exten- sile membrane with which it was repaired. If a vein, having one of these cicatrices in it, be injected with water, the new membrane bulges out, on account of its elasticity, into a pouch or bag.-j- Mr. Travel's is quite con- vinced that this new membrane is continuous with the internal membrane of the vein. Effects of Ligatures on Veins.— The effects of ligatures on veins are different from those on arteries. The coats of the vein are, by the ligature, thrown into longitudinal folds, which are indicated when the vessel is slit up, and its interior examined. The effect on the ele- mentary coats of the veins is different from that produced by ligature on the arteries : instead of the deep cut through the inner and middle coat, which occurs in the latter, there is but a slight indentation, correspond- ing to the ligature on the vein. This is produced by the lesion of the thin internal tunic, and that alone. As regards the rest of the thickness of the vein's walls, it ap- pears that the outer or cellular tunic is di- vided, leaving the middle condensed portion of the venous wall uninjured. Upon a close examination, however, it is found that one element—namely, the yellow elastic tissue — is divided throughout the entire thick- ness of the outer and middle coats, leaving the continuity of tube to be maintained by the white fibrous element, which does not suffer division ; and therefore that part of the wall where the white fibrous element is most condensed and abundant is that where least impression is made by the ligature. A thin, tightly tied, string produces the deepest im- pression. Accordingto Mr Travers, whenaligaturehas been applied for a period of from twenty-four hours to five days, it has produced the follow- ing changes : — " The vein above and below is thrown into longitudinal folds on either side of the ligature. The portion next the heart is perfectly empty and collapsed ; that next the extremity is filled to distens:on by a long, and, generally, firm, coagulum of blood, which is a mould of the vessel, and bears the impression of its semilunar valves. The coagulum ex- tends for several inches; it is not always com- pact and lamellated, and adhering to the in- ternal tunic, being sometimes less consistent and broken; but it always fills the calibre of the vein. There is no blush upon the in- ternal tunic, much less any sign of adhesive inflammation, or thickening of the proper coats of the vein, or agglutination of its contiguous folds ; these folds being effaced on the re- moval of the ligature ; but the cellular sheath is thickened by a deposit of lymph in the vi- cinity of the ligature." * If two ligatures be applied, and the vessel divided between them, the ends retract about an inch. At the se- venth day the interstitial deposit of lymph among the areolar tissue around the vein is very dense, and forms a hard fibrinous mass, through which the ligature runs in a sort of canal. According to Mr. Travers, ulceration commences on the ninth day, and lasts from fifteen to twenty-five days. " The ulcerated ends of the vein formed a crescentic sweep, and were separated to the extent of an inch, and fastened by adhesion to the cellular sheath, which was much extended and thickened by a subjacent deposition of lymph, so as to form a smooth solid bed between the divided ends of the vein. The internal membrane of the superior portion of the vein had a thin ragged edge, where it had been severed by ulceration. The lower edge was smooth and blended in with the bed of the wound. The extremities had undergone no contraction but that produced by the adhesion of the severed extremity to the sheath. The portion of the vein next the heart was empty. The upper f was filled by a dark lamellated coagulum of blood, adhering very strictly to the internal tunic, which was discoloured by it. On care- fully separating the outer lamella; which coated the interior of the vein, I could not discover any thickening of the proper coats of the vein, nor any appearance of inflammatory action within its canal, nor was any such ap- pearance indicated in the lower portion of the vein.J * Travers, loe. cit. p. 240. t See the beautiful plates accompanying Mr. Tra vers's essays before referred to. * Travers, loc. eit. p. 252. j- The jugular vein is referred to. X Travers, loc. cit. p. 253.1397 •VEIN. i v 3 Phlebectesis — Varix. — Dilatation of veins is not only the commonest morbid change in veins, but is the most frequent single patho- logical condition that occurs in the human body. Varix is a condition of vein which occurs in every possible variety of degree, and in va- rious localities, and is generally developed by the superaddition of some mechanical exciting cause upon a constitutional predisposition, — by the operation of some local physical in- fluence upon veins, which, in common with the other veins of the body, already possessed an abnormal laxity or softness of texture that favours their dilatation. The structure of veins, already described, pre-eminently favours their dilatation:—-a structure consisting almost solely of longitu- dinal fibres, with comparatively few in a cir- cular direction to brace up its calibre, pre- sents little to restrain its dilatation beyond the lateral adhesion of the contiguous fibrous rods and their matting together by a certain amount of lateral branching. The coats of veins moreover are very thin, and the amount of distending force applied to them often very- considerable. The anatomical relations of certain veins give them, when in a state of varix, consider- able peculiarities, and various distinctive ap- pellations have been conferred upon such local affections, — varicocele, haemorrhoids, &c.: their pathological identity is, however, indisputable. Though varicosity of the veins is, for the most part, confined, in one individual, princi- pally to one locality, it nevertheless appears to depend upon a vice pervading the entire venous system, the effects of which are more particularly called out in one local'ty by the existence of some mechanical excitant there present. I cannot at all agree with Hasse and Landouzy, " that the full development of this disposition in one locality prevents its out- break in another." This doctrine has, how- ever, been supported by a show of argument. Thus it may be truly said that haemorrhoids, varicocele, anil varicose subcutaneous veins very seldom exist together in the same indivi- dual : the concurrence of either two of them is unusual, and much less frequent than their solitary development ; and moreover the dif- ferent forms are met with, as a rule, in different classes of society : — thus haemorrhoids are most frequent in the affluent, varicocele in the sensual, and varix of the lower extremities in the labouring classes. Again, the different forms appear at different periods of life,— varicocele aboutorsoon after puberty; haemor- rhoids and other varix usually about man- hood. But all these arguments fail, when it is recollected that in each of these suggested instances there is some special circumstance, which, acting as an excitant, superadded to a previous constitutional disposition, might ac- count for the particular locality in which the disease makes its appearance, and the parti- cular time at which it occurs. If in all these instances obstruction to the circulation cannot be made out, there is some cause of greater vascular activity, which is also seen to be efficient in the production of phlebectesis. Haemorrhoids are most frequent in the af- fluent, because their mode of life leads to greater vascular activity in the alimentary canal, and to frequent portal obstruction: varicocele in the sensual, from the greater stress of blood upon the spermatic veins ; at puberty also, from the same cause: the la- bouring classes likewise are afflicted with saphenous varix on grounds similarly expli- cable. It is because there is particular em- phasis laid on one particular organ in each of these cases that the specific form of phlebec- tesis is assumed in the separate examples. And where such influences have been compound, other effects have followed, combining more or fewer forms of varix. It cannot therefore be said that one form of phlebectesis prevails another, or even diminishes the chance of its formation ; the truth is, that the same indivi- dual is not liable to be exposed to the exciting cause of more than one form,— that the pre- disposing condition of the veins may be uni- versal, but in one set alone is the morbid change called forth.* Phlebectesis may conveniently be divided into several forms. Andral has made the fol- lowing division : — " First species. Simple dilatation, unat- tended by any other alteration, either affect- ing the whole length of the vein, or existing only at intervals. " Second species. Dilatation of the veins, either uniform or at intervals, with thinning of the parietes at the dilated points. " Third species. Uniform dilatation of the veins with increased thickness of the parietes. " Fourth species. Dilatation of the veins at intervals with thickening of the parietes at the points where the dilatations exist. " In these two latter species, the vessel in- creases in length as well as in breadth, and in consequence becomes quite tortuous in its course. " Fifth species. Dilatation of the veins, with the development of septa or partitions, which divide the interior of the vessel into small compartments, that allow the blood to stag- nate or to coagulate, &c. " Sixth species. Dilatation of the vein, its in- terior being divided into a number of separate compartments, as in the preceding species, and in addition its parietes drilled by a number of minute holes, which allow the blood to pass from the vein into the surrounding cel- lular tissue," &e. These include all the forms of phlebectesis as far as systematic division is concerned. * This may be very pointedly illustrated by in- stancing the two spermatic veins in varicocele re- spectively. It cannot be said that varix of the left prevents varix of the right spermatic vein; for both, not unfrequently, occur together. It cannot be said that there is any difference in structure or constitution between the two veins in the same in- dividual. Then, why should the left, and the left alone, be, in nine out of ten cases, affected? Simply because a strong mechanical influence operates on one and not on the other vein.1398 VEIN. The first species simply includes a general predominance of the venous system,— a dis- proportionate size of the veins. It is of very frequent occurrence, and is indicated by a plethora or distinctness of the veins of the subcutaneous system. This is often seen in the veins of the back of the hand. It is not to be considered strictly morbid, — it is in many individuals an original conformation, and in others merely temporary, the result of warmth, strong exercise, pressure on a venous trunk, ccc. It is common, nay gene- ral, in old people, though the healthiest. It may be here observed that the capacity of veins, as well as that of arteries, increases with age. The second species represents a condition unquestionably morbid. It consists in a dila- tation of the vein at the expense of its walls, they becoming attenuated in proportion to the increase of the vessel's calibre. This appears to consist essentially in a separating of the longitudinal fibres of the outer coat, by which the internal membrane is permitted to dilate or protrude. The dilatation is seldom cy- lindrical, it is usually unequal and in pouches. These pouches are usually more or less globular or oval; sometimes, however, they are con- stricted, or form pear-shaped, or even pedun- culated, tumours. The third and fourth species of AndraFs division are modifications of the same condi- tion, and seem to be in many cases the direct but gradual result of the first. Whether the dilatation be general and equable, or partial and irregular, the thickening is confined to the dilated portion, and is doubtless a re- parative condition, — an effort to resist by increased strength of the vessel's walls any further stretching ; and it may be ob- served that in this thickened form of phlebec- tesis, those large, pouchy, and tumour-like, dilatations do not occur. In these forms the dilatation is more regular and cylindrical, or increasing somewhat evenly in passing from one part of the vein to another. In almost all these cases there is increased length, some- times very considerable, so as to make the vein assume a serpentine or tortuous course; in some instances the vein remains perfectly straight. The increased thickness arises from the superaddition of fibrous tissue in the ex- ternal coat, probably developed from a sub- inflammatory plastic exudation among the normal tissue of the outer coat, itself an effect of the stretching, in the dilataiion of the vein. The amount of thickening varies in different cases: in those fullv formed it is often very considerable. The increased thickness of the vessel's walls prevents it from collapsing when cut through : it remains patent like an artery. The colour of its tissue differs, however, from the arterial; it is reddish white, and pale,like the normal venous tissue. Besides thickening of the coats of the veins, they become inde- finite and very hard ; the outer coat becomes completely blended with the areolar tissue of the sheath of the vessels; by this means the walls, which are often thicker than those of an artery of the same size, are with difficulty pressed together. As regards the fifth species, I agree with Hasse, that it more deserves to be considered as a mere variety of the others than as itself distinct. TUe septa are probably not new formations. The sixth species, whilst it evidently refers to a particular form of venous dilataiion, is obviously misdescribed ; the minute holes " drilled in the sides of the veins" in this spe- cies being in reality nothing more than the mouths of small and dilated veins, whose di- lated and attenuated walls are not easily re- cognised, and thus the blood is thought to escape into the cellular tissue. To these may be added certain varieties of erectile tumour, which consists essentially of modified capillaries, but on which the venous character is conspicuously impressed. In these cases there are oval or spheroidal tumours of a bluish or purple colour. They are composed of dilated capillary veins, which are supplied by enlarged arteries. The veins are stretched into saccules and crypts, and the blood is re- moved from them in veins disproportioned to the size of the affected part, and often them- selves varicose. Having considered phlebectesis in general, I may conveniently devote some remarks to a few of the special forms of varix. Varices of the Leg. — Varices of the lower extremity usually occur after the commence- ment of adult life. They are generally the result of habitual toil in the erect posture; they result also from obstruction to the cir- culation ; and a not unfrequent source of ob- struction has of late been displayed in the fascia lata that forms the saphenous opening. Briquet has shown that this affection is more common amongst males than females. In 258 males examined by him 71 had varix of the leg; in 485 females, 42 were affected. There is another distinction in the disease as it appears in the two sexes ; in man one trunk is usually affected, or, at all events, the disease is confined to vessels of larger size; whereas in the female, the smaller cutaneous twigs are generally the subject of the disease, and then present an elaborate series of purple ramifica- tions, very superficial and distinct ; and often associated with the latter are circumscribed local varices of greater size. This is the ge- neral rule, but it is liable to exceptions ; each form may occur in either sex, but the latter is almost always confined to the female. This circumstance was, I believe, first pointed out by Hasse. It is unusual for all the veins of the leg to become varicose ; it is usually confined to one branch of the internal saphena : the external saphena may however likewise be affected, or several branches of each. It is uncommon for them to be affected symmetrically ; the right leg, according to Briquet, is most generally the subject of varix. Varices of the leg are arranged in various forms : in some cases they consist of packets of folded and reduplicated tubes, which, not a1390 VEIN. 4 v i little, resemble, when seen through the skin, the vesiculse seminales; in other examples tlie varix is single, straight and prolonged. A re- markable instance of this occurred under the observation of the author not long since ; it consisted in a varicose condition of the in- ternal saphena on one side alone: the vessel formed one large, straight, uniform cylinder from the saphenous opening to the inside of the foot, measuring about two thirds of an inch in diameter. Phlebitis often occurs in varix of the leg. The valves moreover are subject to peculiar malposition, dependent upon the distension of the vessel's tube: these conditions are no- ticed elsewhere. Varicocele, or varicose dilatation of the sper- matic veins is another peculiar form of pide- bectesis. In its general anatomy it differs in no respect fiom the other forms of varix. Varicocele appears to be dependent upon sexual development, and occurs principally about puberty. Landouzy has demonstrated this as follows : — fl" occurred between 9 & 15 yrs. of age. In 41 cases <c 20 „ 15 & 25 „ (.3 „ 25 & 35 „ The influence of mechanical pressure in causing this malady is very strikingly shown by the fact that the disease is almost confined to the left side, on account of the long and uninterrupted current of blood which bears upon the left vein, by means of the high juncture of the spermatic vein of that side with the renal vein. Breschet found in 120 cases but one on the right side. Hemorrhoids, in their relation to phlebecte- sis, consist merely of dilated veins, situated in the vicinity of the anus, and in which chronic inflammation ami thickening of the external coat and surrounding areolar tissue is very conspicuous. The dense covering of areolar tissue, and the comparative smallness of the enclosed vessel's calibre, have given rise to different explanations of the pathological origin of piles. Le Dran, Racamier, Delaroque, Cullen, Chaussier, and others have considered them as encysted coagula of extravasated Wood. Delpech and Cruveilhier describe them as tumours of erectile tissue. But by far the most numerous and reputed pathologists, among whom may be mentioned Andral, Stahl, Petit, Morgagni, Hodgson, Lobstcin, Froriep, and Brodic, concur in the now gene- rally received doctrine of the origin of he- morrhoids in varicose veins. Haemorrhoids consist of ova', ovoid, or round masses with broad bases,situated either just within, or just without, the sphincter ani. On examining the texture of these tumours, they are found to consist of cells or cavities of various sizes, surrounded by layers of red, dense, areolar tissue. These, which vary in shape, are lined internally by the smooth lining membrane of the vein, and are perfor- ated here and there with the apertures of small communicating and tributary veins. The absolute continuity of these cells with the venous cavity has been proved by Hasse and Brodie, who have injected them from the arteries ; the former has also injected them by the veins. They are very apt to inflame and become lined with lymph, or stuffed with coagula. Varices occur in all situations and in every variety : instances are on record where they have occurred in the veins of the oesopha- gus, lips, eyelids, bladder, heart,&c: indeed there appears to be no region which is free from the occasional development of this dis- ease. Rupture or Perforation of Veins — A number of pathological examples, in which perforation of the vessel's walls is the conspicuous cha- racter, may be conveniently, though, it must be confessed, not very naturally, classed under this head. Either with or without previous change, and that change very various, the lesion may occur, so that the only condition common to these instances of morbid change is a breach in the venous cylinder. A rupture, without previous morbid change in the vessel, and which may occur in any case where the tissues of the vein are thin and weak, may be produced by an unusual amount of internal tension of the contained fluid. So again, an attenuated or ulcerated state of vein may yield before an amount of distension that is neither excessive nor unusual : rupture is the result in either case. Destructive disease may, as well in veins as elsewhere, attack the tissues of the organs in question, — suppurative inflammation, ulcer- ation both extrinsic and intrinsic, extension of malignant disease, &C.-J perforation is here the issue. In the rupture of a previously healthy vein the change consists in a rent or tear of the structure, the surrounding tissues being nor- mal : the rent is sharp, and more or less re- gular. In perforation from ulceration, &c. the aperture is rough, irregular, and jagged; the parietes of the vessel are thinned down tow ards the hole, are much thickened more remotely, and the orifice is ragged and shreddy. Sudden or extreme obstruction to the cir- culation, thus causing excessive distension, has produced rupture of the healthy veins. Bichat mentions instances of rupture of the veins of the lower extremities during preg- nancy ; Lee, those of the labia during labour. Violent muscular exertion has ruptured veins, by producing local congestions : Hodgson, for example, has witnessed rupture of the veins of the leg during cramp of the gastrocne- mius ; I have three times seen rupture of a vein on the dorsum of the foot during strong exertion. Andral narrates an example where, during a violent struggle, the vena cava in- ferior was ruptured ; " the borders of the perforation seemed as if they had been torn asunder, and the coats of the vein in the neighbourhood were perfectly healthy." The peculiar bloodlessness of the surface, and con- sequent deep-seated congestion which occurs during rigors or the sudden application of coldVEIN. 1100 to the surface, has ruptured the large internal veins. Portal tells us of a case of rupture of the vena cava superior from a patient getting into a cold bath : and Senac mentions the rupture of the large internal veins as occurring in the rigors of intermittents. Rupture of the inferior cava from disease, has been described by Dr. Squibb, in the Phi- ladelphia Medical Examiner for 1847. " The vein at this point had been very much dilated, and its coats much diseased and thinned: a semiorganized mass or clot, which was con- tained in the dilatation, was connected by its surface to the softened coats of the expanded vessel, and the rupture had occurred at the junction of the edge of this mass with the side ot the vessel, and not at the projecting point cf the dilatation. The tumour was on the anterior portion of the circumference of the vessel, and was overlapped by the edge of the liver, and by a portion of the stomach." Morgagni mentions the rupture of a varicose azygos vein, the result of extreme varicosity. Perforation of veins from suppurative inflam- mation or ulceration is not uncommon. The cavities of the veins, especially in the stomach and uterus, are often laid open by the exten- sion of malignant disease. But the commonest form of venous perforation is from the tegu- mentary varicose ulcers of the leg, which is originally extrinsic to the vein. The following enumeration of ruptured or perforated veins is from Andral. " It has been seen, first, in the superior cava, both witiiin and without the pericardium ; second, in the inferior cava ; third, in the vena porta?, both within and without the liver ; fourth, in the splenic vein ; fifth, in the jugular vein ; sixth, in the subclavian vein ; seventh, in the veins of the extremities ; eighth, in the veins that run between the coats of the intestines." Affections of the Valves of Veins are partly mechanical and partly dynamical. The most frequent change they suffer from is the result of the distension of the vein in which they are placed ; but they are occasionally the sub- ject of the same changes as occur in the vessel itself. In varix the valves are not necessarily damaged, though from the increased size of the vessel in which they are placed they are disproportioned to their office, and become useless. Instances are mentioned by Stan- ley, Langs taff, and Dr. R. Lee, where the valves in varix were quite healthy, thin, and transparent, but drawn aside and inadequate to cross the vessel's tube. The usual result of varix is to injure the valves : they then be- come torn in shreds or perforated ; or the attached margin becomes detached, and the valve is reduced to a membranous thread, which stretches across the diameter of the vessel. In other instances the valves are ren- dered opaque and thick,— the result of chronic inflammation. Whenever any affection of the valves occurs, they are apt to become coated with lymph ; and when a vein is the seat of plastic inflammation, the valves usually be- come ragged fringes of lymph. Phlebolites. — The curious bodies called phlebolites, ph/ebolithes, or vein-stones, which have excited much interest in the pathology of veins, are true vascular calculi, — are cal- culi or earthy concretions deposited from the blood in the veins; and though their mode of formation differs considerably from those other bodies which form in other hollow or- gans, and which we call calculi, they are still quite as much entitled etymologically to the same designation. At a very early date, among the writings of Realdus, Columbus, and Bartholin, phlebolites were recognised and described ; but it was not until Otto, Tiedemann, Cruveilhier, and Carswell devoted their attention to them that they excited much interest. Matured phle- bolites are, for the most part, oval or round- ish bodies, sometimes irregular and flattened ; they are sometimes prolonged and much at- tenuated at one extremity, corresponding to the distal end of the vein in which they are embedded. They vary much in size, from a grain of millet seed to a pea, or even to a hazel nut ; their form also differs. Dr. Lee describes a cylindrical vein stone, which was found in the right common iliac vein of the late Lord Liverpool; it was an inch or more in iength. These concretions are of a yellowish or white colour; they are of varying densit}', being sometimes of bony hardness, and at others much softer, with a firmer nucleus, which is always harder than the other parts of the stone. When sections are made the cut surface presents a series of concentric rings, — there being at different distances from the centre sufficient change of colour and density to mark each annulus ; so that the calculus is thus seen to be composed of successive concentric laminae, hardest in the centre, and gradually becoming softer in proceeding outwards. They are frequently seen sur- rounded externally by a layer of plastic mate- rial, looking like a membranous investment; at other times they are firmly imbedded in a dense coagulum ; but in the majority of instances the)' are free from any covering. The hardest stones, however, contain, inter- mixed with the calcareous matter, much soft anim.il material; for, when desiccated, they diminish in size; and, unless the layers have received equal proportions of earthy deposit, they become irregular. Phlebolites have been made the subject of chemical analysis. According to Gmelin, the following is their composition : — Animal matter - - 27-5 Phosphate of lime - - 53'5 Carbonate of lime - - 15'5 Magnesia and loss - - 3'5 100- This analysis has been repeated with the same general results by Prout, Kemp, Hasse, and Lehmann. They have since been sub- mitted to another analysis by Schlossberger,HOI VEIN. who has given his results more in detail, as follows: — Phosphate of lime 50-1 Phosphate of magnesia Carbonate of lime 13-7 8-3 Organic matter 20-4. Water ... 6-1 Loss - I-4 100- These, then, are phlebolites completely ma- tured. In those les;i completely developed the phlebolite consists of an altered coagulum, in the centre of which is earthy matter, sur- rounded by white fibrinous concentric layers. Cloquet has described one, which was not fully formed, in which the calcification was incomplete. It was taken from the inferior cava, and consisted of a fibrinous mass, con- taining a calcareous centre, from which a number of rays of the same substance passed through the fibrinous matter toward the cir- cumference. Cloquet describes one of similar structure, which he saw in Scemmering's mu- seum, and which was also taken from the inferior cava. In a still more primitive condition these calculi are recognisable. " On drying the coagula found within dilated veins, previously to their having coalesced with the internal membrane, they shrink together, grate under the knife, and exhibit calcareous induration at certain points, even in cases where it had not been at all suspected."* As regards the origin and development of phlebolites, only one opinion is now enter- tained, namely, that they are developed from modified coagula. Andral, however, gives the following explanation. After speaking of cal- careous degeneration of the coats of veins, he goes on to say, " these calcareous concretion*, instead of lying between the coats of the veins, sometimes push the internal membrane before them, and project into the interior of the vessel; the membrane in such cases ge- nerally contracts behind the concretion, and forms a peduncle, which serves to attach it to the side of the vein. It is probable that these peduncles are sometimes ruptured or ab- sorbed, and thus the concretion is completely detached from its connection, and drops loose into the vessel. This rationale may serve to explain the origin of some of those calcareous concretions which have been found in the centre of the venous coagula. f Hodgson imagined that phlebolites were formed in the neighbouring textures, and found their way into the veins by progressive absorption. Dr. Carswell has described and illustrated the true method of their formation in detail, exhibiting their successive changes in the pro- gress of maturation. At first a coagulum of blood is formed, which becomes condensed and laminated in the centre ; the colouring matter of the blood subsequently becomes ab- * Hasse's Pathological Anatomy. f Andral, Precis, d'Anatom. Pathol, torn. ii. sorbed, and leaves ordinary yellow fibrin ; this also becomes lamellated throughout. After this calcification commences in the centre and proceeds outwards till the whole is calcareous. This mode of formation is maintained also by Otto, Tiedemann, Lobstein, Cruveilhier. Errhinan, Briquet, and Uasse. The position of the phlebolite within the vein, anil the condition of the vein and phle- bolite respectively, are subject to much variety. In the dilated pouches, which sometimes form in the sides of the veins, coagula are fre- quently produced, which may terminate in phlebolites. The pouch being filled, the walls become atrophied, the inner surface becomes rough and cellular, and closes firmly round the calculus, sometimes making it appear ex- ternal to the vein. At other times, not only the pouch, but the entire calibre of the vein, becomes implicated and stuffed with calcifying coagulum ; in this case a portion of the tube becomes obliterated. In other instances the phleboliie is free in the cavity of the vein, is ioose and movable, ami the vessel that con- tains it is still permeable to the circulating current. Such phlebolites, though loose and movable, are frequently surrounded by coagula of blood ; sometimes by a layer of fibrin. They have occasionally been surrounded by a thin layer of fibrin, and attached atone point to the side of the vein by a sort of peduncle, the rest of the body hanging free into the cavity of the vessel. Tiedemann very naturally suggests that in these cases the peduncle is produced by the effusion of coagulable lymph, the result of inflammation, caused by the presence of a foreign body. Phlebolites have been discovered in very many of the veins : they have been found in the vena c ava inferior, the renal, the dorsal, the common iliac, anterior and posterior tibial, the saphena and other superficial veins of the lower extremities, the hypogastric veins ; also in the uterine, the vaginal, spermatic, vesical, prostatic, and haemorrhoidal, veins. They have likewise been seen in the splenic and mesen- teric veins. Their most frequent and most abundant position is in the veins of the pelvic viscera. In number they vary considerably : there are generally, though not always, more than one. Tiedemann found thirty-six in the spermatic veins of one individual,—fifteen in one, and twenty-one in the other. They occur almost always after middle age. They produce no injury or inconvenience ; nor is their presence known, except in a few situations, during the life of the individual. There are some general circumstances re- lative to phlebolites which are striking and curious. They always occur in veins below the diaphragm, — in depending veins, — in veins which circulate their blood against the force of gravity. According to Hasse, they always occur in conjunction with phlebectesis. They frequently, perhaps generally, occur in veins returning the blood from diseased organs, — from n diseased testicle or prostate, from an ulcerated rectum, from an inflamed orVEIN. H02 cancerous uterus, from an ulcerated leg, &c. Examples of all these are on record. What, then, determines their development? This question it is not easy to answer ; all we can say is, that those circumstances which fa- cilitate mechanically the coagulation of the blood, favour their production; and it is not improbable also that a vitiated state of blood may predispose to and favour their develop- ment: it is certainly probable that the pre- disposing causes, whatever they are, may be started into activity and be made efficient for the production of these bodies, by some temporary local disturbance of the circulation, or by some slight subinflammatory condition, which varicose veins readily take on, and which, were it not for the existence of pre- disposing circumstances, would soon be re- solved. Calcareous Degeneration of Feins. — The transformation of the walls of veins into earthy tubes, or calcareous deposition among their tissues, is infinitely less common than in arteries. It still however does occur, and apparently in the same manner, by the same progressive changes, and from the existence of the same constitutional tendency, only in cir- cumstances of greater intensity. Occasionally patches of atheromatous de- posit — consisting, as in arteries, of choles- terine, oil, and phosphate of lime, — are seen on the inner surface of veins, though they are always much smaller, and less general than those which are found in the arteries of the same individual. They present a white opaque appearance, and produce a slight elevation of the surface where they are situate. This de- posit becomes converted by degrees into bony matter, as in arteries ; but instances where this has existed to any considerable extent, are very rare. There are, however, some few on record. Bailie has described ossification of the inferior cava. Morgagni refers to a case observed by Bonazolius and Stancarius, in which the cava and emulgents were much dilated, and con- verted partly into cartilage and partly into bone. Beclard mentions an instance where the femoral vein was calcined, and it was lying in contact with a still more ossified fe- moral artery. Horn noticed ossification of the femoral and uterine veins. Mr. Hodgson re- lates an instance of ossification of the saphena, in which one calcareous patch measured an inch in length; ami Phoebus states that he saw in an anatomical museum an ossified sa- phenous vein taken from a patient fifty-six years of age, who died of cancer of the stomach. By the calcareous deposit the vein was rendered thick and inflexible ; but at the points corresponding with the joints of the leg the vein could be bent. The deposition was between the coats of the vein, and was less regular than that which is found in the coats of arteries. The lining membrane was thick, opaque, and nowhere broken. Microscopi- cally, the deposit presented irregular projec- tions and excavations. Furst and Bonetus have found the coronary veins of the heart converted into bone. Otto enumerates in- stances of this change as also having occurred in the splenic, ported, brachial, femoral, and coronary veins. A concretion of phosphate of lime, the size of a nut, was found by Andral in the parietes of the external saphena. This might have been an attached phlebolite. Fatty Tumours. — Fatty tumours are occa- sionally developed in the walls of veins around the areolar tissue. Andral mentions one,— " I once saw a case of this description, in w hich a tumour, presenting all the anatomical characters of adipose tissue, was developed between the coats of the vena portae, near its entrance into the liver. This tumour, which was about the size of a walnut, projected into the interior of the vein, and almost entirely ob'iterated its cavity.* Entozoa in Veins. — There is upon record a unique example of acephalocysts being deve- loped in the pulmonary veins of the human subject, in which pouches were formedfor their reception. The observation was made by Andral. I quote his description in extenso from the " Clinique Medicalc." " Several of these (acephalocysts) were lodged in pouches with a smooth surface, which at first seemed to be so many cysts. Others of them empty, and rolled several times on themselves, were contained in nar- row canals, the elongated form of w hich they assumed. The inner surface of these canals was smooth, like that of the great pouches ; they ramified like vessels. We soon ascer- tained that at each pouch a vessel terminated of small calibre, which, to form it, underwent greater or less dilatation. We then dissected the pulmonary veins, at their entrance into the heart, and w e traced them into the lungs : when we had come to the;r almost capillary divisions, we began to perceive several of them present a considerable number of enlargements, which were filled with hydatids. After being thus dilated, the vein resumed its original ca- libre ; then, a little further on, it was again dilated. The largest of the pouches might have contained a large nut, and the smallest would admit a pea. They existed equally in both lungs. The hydatids, which they contained, had all the characters of acephalocysts ; se- veral presented small points of a dull white colour in their substance ; others presented on their inner surface a great number of miliary granulations. Most of them were burst."-)- Another entozoon, the Distoma hepaticum, has been found in the (hepatic) veins. Several examples have been recorded, but have again been questioned. The matter has, however, now been set at rest. In 1830, M. Duval, at Rennes, demonstrated to an anatomical class several of these parasites in the hepatic veins of a man. They were floating about in the fluid blood. The vessels themselves were free from any lesion.

VENOUS SYSTEM (in descriptive hu- man anatomy). — Under this head it is in- tended to give a connected and concise ac- count of the descriptive anatomy of the several elements of the venous system, referring the reader to those articles which treat of the regional anatomy of the body, in which will be found the application of the subject in its practical bearings, in so far at least as the large venous trunks are concerned. The veins connect the capillary vessels with the heart, one of their functions being, to bring back to the central organ of the cir- culation the blood which has been distributed over all parts of the body : they are naturally divided into two classes. 1. The veins which concur to form the two vence cavee, and which thus communicate with the right auricle of the heart ; these constitute the systemic venous si/stem: and 2. The veins which commence in the ca- pillaries of the lungs, and finally discharge their contents into the left auricle: these re- present the pulmonary venous system. These two classes of veins differ from each other in the nature of their contents, no less than in their modes of termination, for whilst the sjstemic veins contain dark-coloured, and essentially venous blood, the office of the pulmonary veins is to convey red or arterial blood from the pulmonary capillaries, where it has been re-oxygenated, to the left auricle of the heart. Valves are not found in the veins of the pulmonary system, whilst they are very abundant in many of the systemic veins. The cardiac veins constitute a small system apart from that of the general venous system, for not having any communication with the venae cavas or with any of their branches, these veins open by a separate orifice into the right auricle of the heart. Neither can the portal veins be included in any general description of the venous system. These veins emanate from the stomach, in- testines, spleen, and pancreas, and unite to form one large vessel, the vena porta;, which entering the liver, branches out in every di- rection through that organ after the maimer of an artery, and thus constitutes the system of the vena porta;. From the capillaries of the portal vein in the liver, another series of veins is derived, which coalesce and form larger and larger trunks, like the systemic veins generally, and ultimately, to the number of three or four, issue from the liver at its thick margin, and join the inferior vena cava. These last-men- tioned veins are termed hepatic veins, or vena? cava; hepaticae, and the function to w hich they are subservient in the economy, is that of re- conveying into the general venous system, the blood which has been diverted to the liver by the ramifications of the portal vein. 1. The Pulmonary Veins. These veins commence in the capillaries of the pulmonary lobules, and by successive junctions with adjacent branches enlarge in size, whilst they diminish in number. They traverse the lungs in company with the sub- divisions of the bronchial tubes and of the pul- monary arteries, the number of venous rami- fications being identical with that of the arterial, and finally emerge from those organs, having formed into trunks, each of which correspondsVENOUS SYSTEM. 1404 to a lobe of the lungs. There are consequently three venous trunks for the right lung, and two for the left. On the right side the branch from the middle lobe unites with that from the superior; and hence two pulmonary veins, one superior to the other, are usually found in the root of each lung, where on both sides they are placed below but on a plane anterior to the pulmonary artery and bronchial tube. In the substance of the lungs the relative po- sition of these parts is different, for there the branches of the veins are behind, whilst those of the artery are in front, the bronchus being interposed between both. The four pulmonary veins then perforate the pericardium, and after a short course enter the most posterior part of the left auricle, those of the left side opening very close to- gether, and not unfrequently by a common orifice. Within the pericardium these veins are in- vested by its serous membrane, but on their anterior surfaces only. In passing to their destination, the right pulmonary veins lie behind the right auricle of the heart. II. The Systemic Veins. The veins of this system will be described in the following order. a. The veins which form the vena cava superior, anil which are derived from the head, face, neck, thorax, and upper extremities. Amonst these the veins of the parieties of the thorax (azi/gos veins), and those of the spinal column (rachidian veins'), are remarkable as serving to connect the branches of the superior with those of the inferior vena cava. b. The veins which form the vena cava inferior, and which convey the blood from the lower extremities and from the pelvic and abdominal cavities. The portal veins are an adjunct to this system. c. The proper veins of the heart (cardiac veins), which arise in the substance of that organ, and open by a separate trunk into the right auricle. A. The Veins which form the Vena Cava Superior. These are constituted by the veins, 1. Of the head and face ; 2. Of the neck ; 3. Of the upper extremities ; 4 . Of the thorax. 1. Veins of the head and face. * — The super- ficial veins of the head and face unite to form three principal trunks, which are placed on the anterior, lateral, and posterior aspects of the cranium ; anterior/// is seen the Facial vein. — This vein originates in the * The veins of the head may be divided into two sets, those which ramify on its exterior and those which occupy its interior; the former will alone be noticed in tins place. The latter, which are repre- sented by the cerebral veins and sinuses of the dura mater, are described in Article Nervous Centres (Dr. Todd), Vol. III. 631. Intermediate to these two systems are the veins of the bones of the head (the diploic veins), which, by their inosculations with both, maintain a free communication between the superficial and deeper seated veins. For a de- scription of the diploic veins, see Art. Bone, Vol. I. p. 43G. frontal region from numerous interlacing branches, which usually give rise to one large vein on each side (frontal vein), which is joined by branches from the upper lid (palpe- bral) and root of the nose, and by the supra- orbital vein ; sometimes there is but one frontal vein placed in the mesial line, and dividing into two branches, which descend one on either side of the nose. The frontal vein continues its course in the sulcus along the inner margin of the orbit under the name of angular vein, accompanying the artery of the same name, and receives numerous brandies from the orbit, by which a close connexion is maintained between the circulation on the exterior of the cranium and that of the cere- brum itself. At the lower margin of the orbit the angular becomes the proper facial vein, which passes downwards and outwards in an almost direct course to the anterior edge of the insertion of the masseter muscle. The facial vein consequently has a much shorter extent than its corresponding artery., to the outer side of which it is invariably placed ; it passes beneath the zygomatic mus- cles, and lies on Steno's duct, just where the latter is about to penetrate between the fibres of the buccinator muscle. Thefaci.d vein receives the following branches. Veins from the alae nasi, the coronary, buccal, infra-orbital, and masseteric veins; and also several large communicating veins (deep facial or alveolar) from a venous plexus which is lodged in the pterygoid space. Having passed below the ramus of the jaw, the facial vein enters the digastric space, which it traverses from above downwards and back- wards, and lies beneath the platysma myoides and on the submaxillary gland (which con- sequently is interposed between the facial vein and artery) ; this vein next passes across the external carotid artery to terminate in the internal jugular vein, having been previously joined by a large branch of communication from the temporo-maxillary vein. In its course through the digastric space the facial vein receives (a), the ranine vein, which comes from the inferior surface of the tongue, passes backwards by the side of the fraenum, and accompanies the t^poglossal nerve, between the rn)lo-hyoid and hyo-glossus muscles; (b), the satellite vein of the gustatory nerve, which is derived from a plexus of superficial veins on the dorsum of the tongue, and com- municates freely with the preceding (Cruveil- hicr); (c), the submental vein, which arises in the sublingual gland ; and (d) several palatine veins which are derived from a venous plexus encircling the tonsil. In many instances the facial vein unites with the proper lingual veins, and thus forms a common trunk, which throws itself into the internal jugular ; into this common trunk the superior thyroid, pharyngeal, and temporo- maxillary veins, will in such a case be fre- quently found to open. On the lateral region of the head are placed the trunks of the temporal and internal max- illary veins.1405 VENOUS SYSTEM. The temporal vein is formed by the union of two branches, which represent the superficial and middle temporal arteries. The superficial temporal veins form a wide- spreading network of vessels on the lateral aspect of the scalp, which communicates with the frontal veins in front, with the occipital behind, and with the temporal veins of the opposite side across the vertex. The middle temporal veins arise in the sub- stance of the temporal muscle, where they are joined, behind the external orbital process, by branches from the orbit: these veins, by their union, form a branch which is placed at first between the temporal muscle and fascia, but subsequently perforates the latter imme- diately above the zygoma, and forms with the superficial temporal vein a common trunk, which enters the parotid gland, and unites with the internal maxillary vein. Internal maxillary vein. — In the pterygoid space the branches of veins which correspond to those given off in the same region by the internal maxillary artery, viz. the inferior dental, deep temporal, pterygoid, and (according to Cruveilhier) the middle meningeal veins {vena comites to the middle meningeal artery, which communicate in the cranium with the inferior cerebral veins), unite to form a great venous plexus placed between the pterygoid muscles, which communicates freely, as has been men- tioned, with the facial vein. Arising from this plexus, the internal maxillary vein passes backwards along with its artery, between the ramus of the jaw and the internal lateral liga- ment of the temporo-maxillary articulation, and entering the parotid gland joins the tem- poral vein ; by the union of these branches the external jugular vein is formed. Many ana- tomists give to the upper portion of the venous trunk, formed in the manner which has just been described, the name of temporo-max- illary vein, by others it is designated posterior facial, names which are applied to it until it has emerged from the parotid gland, where, according to these authorities, the proper external jugular vein commences. The temporo-maxillary vein (or that stage of the external jugular vein which is contained in the parotid gland) is joined by the branches which accompany the transverse facial and posterior aural arteries, and sends off a large communicating branch, which unites with the facial vein. The temporo-maxillary vein is situated more superficially than the external carotid artery, which it separates from the plexiform rami- fications of the portio dura nerve. On the posterior region of the head is found the occipital vein. The ramifications of this vein are spread over the posterior portion of the scalp, and correspond very accurately to the terminal branches of the occipital artery; the trunk which they form likewise acconi- paniesthat of the artery, passes with it beneath the splenitis and sterno-mastoid muscles, and joins the internal jugular vein below the di- gastric muscle ; less frequently it unites with the external jugular vein. Opposite the mastoid process, the occipital vein is joined by several branches from the mastoid region, one of which passes through a canal in the bone (mastoid hole), and communicates directly with the lateral sinus of the dura mater. 2. Feins of the neck. — The most remarkable of these are the internal and external jugular, and the vertebral veins. External jugular vein. — This vessel is the principal channel of the superficial venous circulation of the neck. Its direction is down- wards and blightly outwards, and it extends from the lower margin of the parotid gland to the subclavian vein. Crossing the sterno-mas- toid obliquely, the external jugular vein de- scends parallel to the posterior edge of that muscle, through the supra-clavicular space, and lies on the deep cervical fascia, by which it is separated from the omohyoid muscle, bra- chial plexus, and subclavian artery. Finally, the vein passes forwards through an opening in the fascia cervicalis, and joins the subcla- vian vein. Several of the nerves of the cer- vical plexus are related to this vein ; many of their branches cross it as they descend the neck; and the largest of the three ascending branches of the plexus, the nervus auricularis magnus, is parallel to the vein and to its outer side, as it lies on the sterno-mastoid muscle. Throughout the entire of its extent the ex- ternal jugular vein is covered by the fibres of the platysma myoides, which cross its direc- tion obliquely forwards and inwards. This vein is furnished with two sets of valves, one of which is placed at its entrance into the sub- clavian vein, and by this circumstance the ex- ternal jugular is distinguished from all other veins of the head or neck, in none of w hich are valves found to exist. The branches which the external jugular vein receives are the following : first, several large veins from the posterior region of the neck ; one of these, which from its superior size, and also from its position, may be distinguished by the name of posterior jugular vein, descends from beneath the trapezius muscle, through the postero-superior triangle of the neck, and joins the external jugular vein a little below its centre. Lower down this latter vein re- ceives, secondly, the " venae comites" of the superior and posterior scapular arteries. By its anterior surface the external jugular vein receives; thirdly, muscular branches; fourthly, a communicating branch, which passes be- neath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and joins the internal jugular vein ; and sometimes, fifthly, the anterior jugular vein. Anterior jugular vein. — This vein is but seldom absent, although its size is subject to much variety ; in general its development is inversely as that of the external jugular trunk, to which it is to be regarded as sup- plemental. The branches of origin of the anterior jugular vein are derived from several small muscular and cutaneous veins of the supra-hyoid region, w hich generally communi- cates with the facial veins. Thus formed, this vein passes down by the side of the larynx along the anterior margin of the sterno-VENOUS SYSTEM. H06 mastoid muscle, beneath which it passes, a little above the clavicle, to join the internal jugular vein, close to the junction of the latter with the subclavian vein. The anterior jugular vein, in its course down the neck, communicates freely with the inter- nal and external jugular veins, and sometimes terminates by opening into the latter. It receives branches from the larynx, and sometimes from the thyroid gland. Not unfrequently the veins of opposite sides are connected by a transverse braneh, which crosses the trachea immediately above the sternum, and receives the terminations of some of the inferior thyroid veins, and of one or two subcutaneous veins from the thorax. Internal jugular vein. — The blood which has circulated through the brain and sinuses of the dura mater, is returned by the great lateral sinus to the internal jugular vein, which extends from the posterior part of the foramen lacerum posterius, to the root of the neck, where on each side it forms the vena in- nominata, by its union with the subclavian vein. Its direction is strictly vertical. At its commencement this vein presents an oval dilatation (sinus, or gulph of the internal jugular vein), which is lodged in the jugular fossa, and into which the inferior petrosal sinus of the dura mater opens. The internal ju- gular vein is placed posterior, and external, to the internal carotid artery, (the lingual, glosso- pharyngeal, and pneumogastric nerves inter- vening,) and rests upon the anterior surface of the rectus capitis lateralis muscle ; but as the vein is traced downwards, it will be found, a littie below the base of the skull, to lie parallel with, and to the outer side of, the internal carotid ; the spinal accessory nerve here de- scends upon the anterior surface of the vein. Subsequently, the internal jugular vein enters the sheath of the common carotid artery, along with the vagus nerve, and preserves the same rtlative position to that great vessel as it did to its internal branch. At the root of the neck the vein of the right side intersects, at right angles, the front of the first stage of the subclavian artery; on the left side, the vein, whilst it is anterior, is at the same time parallel, to the thoracic stages of the sub- clavian and carotid arteries. Collateral brunches of the internal jugular vein.—Opposite the cornu of theos hyoides, the internal jugular vein is joined by (a) the facial vein, and sometimes by (b) a large communi- cating branch from the temjwro-maxillary vein, by which its size is sensibly augmented ; above the os hyoides, it receives (c) the pharyngeal vein, derived from a venous plexus on the sides and back of the phanynx ; (d), the proper lin- gual veins, two in number, " venae comites " of the lingual artery, the course of which they accurately follow : the lingual veins, as has been already stated, sometimes form a trunk of considerable size, by uniting with the facial vein * ; and (e), the occipital vein, w hich has * In considering the distribution of the veins of the tongue, it may be observed that there are two been described in the preceding page. Below the level of the os hyoides, the internal jugular vein receives (f) a laryngeal branch, which escapes from the larynx through an opening in the thyro-hyoid membrane ; (g), the supe- rior thyroid veins, " venae comites " of the superior thyroid artery, and which emanate from the superficial and upper portions of the thyroid gland : these occasionally terminate in the anterior jugular vein, or in the common trunk of the facial and lingual veins when it is present; and (h) the middle thyroid veins, which pass out from the lower part of the lateral lobe of the gland, and join the most inferior portion of the internal jugular vein. The vertebral vein. — The vertebral vein arises by muscular branches, which are deeply placed at the base of the skull, in the vicinity of the foramen magnum, and first exists as a distinct trunk in the foramen of the transverse process of the atlas, where it is joined by two communicating branches, one of which passes through the posterior condy- loid foramen, and opens into the great lateral sinus, whilst the other is derived from the oc- cipital vein. The course and relations of the vertebral vein, from this to its termination, are iden- tical with those of the cervical stage of its corresponding artery, which it accompanies through the foramina in the transverse pro- cesses of the cervical vertebrae. On issuing from the foramen of the sixth vertebra, it is joined by the veins which accompany the ar- teria cervicalis profunda and the arteria cer- vicalis superficial. Lastly, the vertebral vein usually passes behind the subclavian artery on the right side, and in front of that vessel, on the left side, to terminate in the vena inno- minata. Sometimes, though rarely, the ver- tebral ends in the internal jugular vein.* The vertebral veins anastomose very freely with the spinal veins, as well with those which are within the spinal canal, as with those which are external to the vertebrae, by means of small branches which enter the foramina, by which the cervical spinal nerves issue. 3. Veins of the upper extremity. — These veins are arranged in two scries,a superficial and a deep; both of w hich are provided with valves, but the deep veins the most abundantly. Superficial Veins. — In the fore-arm and hand these veins are distributed with great minuteness in the subcutaneous areolar tissue, and anastomose freely with one another; but their larger branches chiefly occupy the radial and ulnar (the lateral) aspects of the fore-arm. The radial or external superficial veins ema- nate from numerous venules on the thumb and dorsum of the fore-finger, and are joined superficial or submucous veins, (the ranine vein, and the satellite vein of the gustatory nerve') correspond- ing to the subcutaneous veins in the limbs, by which the blood is returned when the deep veins (proper lingual) are compressed during the contractions of the organ. * Vide Art. Subclavian Arteuy, Vol. IV. pp. 815. and 822.J 407 VENOUS SYSTEM. in the fore-arm by many cutaneous branches from either side. Opposite the elbow joint these tributaries have ended in one vessel of considerable size, the cephalic vein, which, being joined by a branch from the median vein {median cephalic), ascends between the biceps and supinator longus muscles, follows the outer margin of the biceps, traverses the interspace between the pectoralis major and the deltoid, and ultimately having arrived in the subclavicular triangle, bends over the upper edge of the pectoralis minor, penetrates the thin expansion of the "fascia clavicularis" (Ugamentum bicorne), and enters the axillary vein immediately beneath the clavicle. In some instances a branch is continued upwards from the cephalic vein, which passes over the clavicle and communicates with the external jugular vein. The ulnar or internal superficial veins have their origins from veins which ramify on the dorsum of the hand and of the two inner fingers, one of which from the little finger has been long known as the "vena salvatella;" others arise anteriorly from subcutaneous veins on the front of the wrist. In the vici- nity <>f the elbow both sets of branches unite to form one principal trunk, the basilic vein, which is reinforced almost at the moment of its formation by the median basilic vein, a branch of very considerable size from the median. The basilic vein, now much enlarged, as- cends along the inner margin of the biceps muscle, parallel to the brachial artery, but more superficially than that vessel, (for the deep fascia intervenes,) until it arrives oppo- site the centre of the arm, when it pierces the brachial aponeurosis, and joins one or other of the vence comites of the brachial artery. In a few instances the vein ascends as high as the axilla, and entering that space joins the trunk of the axillary vein. The superficial veins in the front of the upper part of the fore-arm unite to form a short trunk termed median vein, which by its lateral branches connects the radial and ulnar super- ficial veins ; near the bend of the elbow the median vein receives a large communicating branch from the venae comites of the brachial artery, and terminates by dividing into two very considerable veins, termed median basilic and median cephalic veins respectively : the latter passes obliquely upwards and outwards, over the tendon of the biceps, and joins the cephalic vein ; the former, which is the largest, inclines inwards, and in its course to join the basilic trunk passes across the bra- chial artery, separated from it only by the " semilunar fascia" of the biceps tendon. The deep veins of the upper extremity ac- company the ramifications of the larger arteries chiefly, which in the lower as well as in the upper extremity, are invariably attended by two veins, one on either side, hence called vence comites; transverse branches at short intervals maintain a free communication between these vessels. The vence comites of the ulmar artery are de- rived from veins which correspond to the di- gital arteries, and which form a superficial pa/mar arch of veins, which at its outer ex- tremity receives branches from the deep radial veins, through which the venae comites of the radial and ulnar arteries are brought into com- munication with each other. The associate veins of the interosseous artery unite with the venae comites of the ulnar artery. The vence comites of the radial artery com- mence from the palmar hiterosseal veins, which form a deep palmar arch across the heads of the metacarpal bones, and are joined by veins from the muscles of the thumb, and by branches of the superficial arch which follow the course of the arteria superficialis volae. The vena; comites of both the radial and ulnar arteries receive numerous tributaries from the veins of the adjacent muscles, and ultimately unite to form the Satellite veins of the brachial artery. — The brachial venae comites are joined by veins which correspond to the branches of the brachial artery in the arm (superior and inferior profunda and anastomotic^ magna), and also by the basilic vein. At the lower part of the axilla, these veins, by their union, form the axillary vein. The axillary vein returns all the blood from the upper limb : it is formed by the union of the brachial venae comites (with one or other of which, in the arm, the basilic vein is con- tinuous), whilst the cephalic vein joins it near its termination. Like its accompanying artery, the axillary vein consists of three stages, and its relations to surrounding parts are identical with those of that vessel. The vein is placed internal and anterior to the artery throughout its entire course. When the arm is abducted, the vein becomes inferior. In addition to the cephalic vein, the axil- lary trunk receives numerous branches which correspond to those of the axillary artery, viz., the circumflex and subscapular veins, the alar, and the long, superior, and acromial thoracic veins. The axillary is the last vein of the upper extremity, as we approach the heart, in which values exist: at the lower edge of the first rib it becomes continuous with the subcla- vian vein. Subclavian vein. — This great vessel extends from the axillary vein to the inner margin of the scalenus anticus muscle, where it uniteswith the internal jugular vein, to form the vena innominata. The subclavian vein therefore corresponds to the second and third stages only of the subclavian artery ; and, as the direction of the vein is nearly transverse, whilst that of the artery describes an arch, it necessarily follows that the former vessel is much shorter than the latter. On both sides of the neck the scalenus anticus muscle, and the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves, are, interposed between these associated vessels. The subclavian vein is related anteriorly to the subclavius and sterno-mastoid muscles, to the clavicle, supra-scapular artery, platysma, and superficial structures of the neck, andVENOUS SYSTEM. 1+08 rests upon the first rib, the scaleni muscles, and the phrenic nerve, which descends be- tween the vein and the scalenus anticus mus- cle. Contrary to what is observed in the case of the axillary and of most other veins of large size, the branches which join the subclavian vein do not correspond to those which are given off' by the subclavian artery. The collateral branches of the subclavian vein, are the external and internal jugular veins; the former joins it on the outer, and the latter on the inner side of the sterno-mastoid mus- cle. The subclavian vein not uncommonly receives the vertebral also, although, as has been stated, this vein is most frequently a tributary of the brachio-cephalic trunk. Brachio-cephalic veins. (Vena innominata?, Meckel.) — These veins, one on each side, are formed by the union of the internal jugu- lar with the subclavian vein ; they are appa- rently of the same size, but are contrasted in other essential particulars, as they are ex- amined on the right and left side: thus they will be found to differ from each other in length and in direction, as well as in their connexions with surrounding parts, as also in the number of collateral branches which they respectively receive. The right vena innominala is comparatively short, and nearly vertical in direction ; it is placed behind the cartilage of the first rib, and is related externally to the right pleura and internally to its corresponding artery, the arteria innominata ; the vein and artery how- ever are not in close apposition, and the right pneumogastric nerve is found in the interval between them, but deeper than both; fila- ments of the cardiac nerves also are inter- posed between them.* The left vena innominata, more than twice as long as the preceding, traverses the upper part of the anterior mediastinum almost hori- zontally from left to right, but at the same time with an obliquity downwards and slightly forwards. It is placed behind the first bone of the sternum, from which it is separated by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and by the thymus gland ; and bending across the three primary branches of the aorta, slightly overlaps the anterior surface of the arch itself towards the right side. Imme- diately below the cartilage of the first rib and on the right side of the mesian line, the innominate veins unite to form the superior vena cava. Collateral branches. — The vertebral is in general the only vein which terminates in the right vena innominata, for although it does occasionally occur that the inferior th\roid and internal mammary veins join the vena in- nominata on their respective sides, yet in the great majority of instances these veins ter- minate differently on the right and left side : on the left they almost invariably open into * At the moment of its formation the right vena innominata is placed anterior, and inferior, to the first stage of the subclavian artery ; between them, however, we find the mammary artery, and the phrenic and pneumogastric nerves. the corresponding vena innominata, whilst on the right they as constantly open into the vena cava superior. It is not very uncom- mon for the left vena innominata to receive all the inferior thyroid veins ; and the left superior intercostal vein, which is usually connected by a large collateral branch with this vein, sometimes, but more rarely, termi- nates directly in that vessel. Inferior thyroid veins. — Although generally described as consisting of two principal trunks, one for each side, these veins very often con- sist of as many as four or more branches, which, arising from a plexus of veins in the interior of the thyroid gland, emerge from its lower border and descend on the front of the trachea, covered by the deep layer of fascia and by the infra-hyoid muscles, to open into the left vena innominata. These veins lie in a well-defined triangular space of much sur- gical importance, which is bounded on the one side by the innominata, and on the other by the left carotid artery, whilst its third side, which represents the base of the triangle, is defined by the lower margin of the thyroid body : the apex is constituted by the con- vergence of the arteries which form its sides, to the arch of the aorta ; and in this latter direction, the space above described is some- what encroached on by the left vena inno- minata. Sometimes the thyroid veins of op- posite sides unite to form an arch across the trachea, and in some few instances they open into the transverse branch of communication which sometimes unites the anterior jugular veins of opposite sides. Internal mammary veins. — These, which constitute "venae comites" to the trunk of each internal mammary artery, are formed by branches which correspond with those which emanate from that vessel. Very frequently the two vessels unite in a single trunk, which ends, as has been stated, in the vena inno- minata on the left side, and in the vena cava on the right. Vena cava superior. — This great vein re- ceives all the blood from the head and neck, and from the upper extremities; it is formed by the union of the two brachio-cephalic veins, and extends from the lower margin of the cartilage of the first rib on the right of the sternum, to the upper and posterior part of the right auricle of the heart where it terminates. Shortly after its formation, the superior vena cava enters the pericardium. That portion of the vein which is without the pericardium (and which is of very small extent) is invested by a sheath of the fibrous layer of that membrane, whilst its intra-pericardial stage is completely invested by the serous membrane, which it serves to convey to the surface of the heart. In its entire course this vein describes a curve, the convexity of which is related to the right pleura with the inter- vention of the pericardium, whilst the con- cavity touches the aorta ; the pericardium is anterior to it, and the pulmonary artery of the right side passes behind it. The principal collateral branch of the thoracic vena cava is1409 VENOUS SYSTEM. the great azygos vein, which joins that trunk at the moment of its entrance into the cavity of the pericardium. Azygos veins,*—The azygos veins anil their tributaries (which are described by Cruveil- hier amongst the superficial rachidian veins) constitute a remarkable system which is of great importance, as it assists in maintaining the circulation through the spinal system of veins, and at the same time connects the branches of the superior with those of the inferior vena cava. The veins of the azygos system usually consist of three principal trunks, the greater and lesser azygos veins, and the left superior interc stal vein. The vena azygos major commences in the lumbar region, by the union of several branches from the upper lumbar veins, through which it communicates with the inferior vena cava. Sometimes the azygos vein receives a branch directly from that vessel,and frequently another from the renal vein. After a very short stage in the abdomen, the great azygos vein enters the thorax through the aortic canal in the diaphragm, and ascends on the vertebral column to the right of the aorta, from which it is separated by the thoracic duct. Having arrived at the third dorsal vertebra, the vein now changes its di- rection, and passing forwards and to the right side, leaves the posterior mediastinum, arches over the right bronchus, and descends to ter- minate in the superior vena cava, where that vessel is about to enter the pericardium. The vena azygos major is joined by all the intercostal veins of the right side, and by the lesser azygos vein, through the medium of which it communicates with the lower inter- costal veins of the left side also. Two or three of the middle intercostal veins of the left side open directly into the great azygos vein, it likewise communicates very freely with the left superior intercostal vein. The lesser azygos vein (or left or inferior azygos vein), likewise has its origin in the lumbar region, from some of the upper lumbar veins on the left side of the spine ; it anas- tomoses with the neighbouring veins which ramify on the surface of the vertebrae, and is connected, more frequently even than the greater azygos vein, with the corresponding renal vein (Breschet). The lesser azygos vein enters the thorax, either through the aortic canal in the diaphragm, or by per- forating its left cms along with the left splanchnic nerve, ascends on the left side of the spine, as high as the fifth or sixth dorsal vertebra, where, crossing the front of the spinal column, behind the aorta, to terminate in the great azygos vein. The veins from the five or six lower inter- * As these veins have already been described in an article specially devoted to the subject, they are but briefly noticed in this place, and only in so far as was necessary to carry out the design of giving a continuous description of the elements of the venous system. Vide Art. Azygos (Dr. Harrison), Vol. I. p. 364. VOl,. IV. costal spaces terminate in this vessel. In some instances there is no venous trunk cor- responding to that above described, in which case the left intercostal veins cross the spinal column behind the thoracic aorta, to join the great vein of the right side, which, under these circumstances only, is appropriately termed " azygos." The left superior intercostal vein (left supe- rior azygos vein) is formed by the union of the three or four superior intercostal veins of the left side. Its course is subject to some variety, but it always serves to establish a connexion between the azygos system and the deep veins of the neck. In many instances this vein passes upwards, and opens into the left vena innominata, but more frequently it descends, increasing in size as it approaches its termi- nation in the great azygos vein. Sometimes the left superior intercostal vein terminates in the azygos minor. There is sometimes a similar branch on the right side, which corresponds to the right su- perior intercostal artery ; this vein is always inferior in size to that of the left side, and, like it, terminates in the great azygos vein. The bronchial veins are the " venae comites " of the bronchial arteries, from the capillaries of which they are derived, and which they accompany throughout the lungs. They leave the root of the lung, having formed into two or three trunks, and terminate, on the right side, in the superior vena cava, or in the great azygos vein, and on the left side in the left superior intercostal vein, or in the azygos minor. In the pelvis the middle and lateral sacral veins represent the azygos system ; they com- municate freely with the veins in the sacral canal, and with the vesical and haemorrhoidal plexuses, and end in the common iliac veins. The sacral veins thus establish a communi- cation between the general venous system and the system of the vena portae. There are no valves in the azygos veins, although they exist in great numbers in their tributaries, the intercostal veins. Veins of the spine.* (Rachidian veins: Breschet.) — These veins, imperfectly known to Ohaussier, were first accurately described by Dupuytren and Breschet-f-; they have been comprehensively arranged by Cruveilhier, who includes, under the head of spinal veins, a larger portion of the venous system than the author first quoted. By Cruveilhier the veins of the spinal system are divided into—A. The superficial or extra-spinal, and B., the deep or intraspinal veins. A. The superficial veins of the spine are sub- divided into the anterior and the posterior. * Such of the veins of the spine as are situated in the interior of the spinal canal, are described in the Article Nervous System (Dr. Todd), at page 629, Vol. III. of this work; any other than a brief notice of the subject in this place is, therefore, un- necessary. t Essai sur les Veines du Eachis, 4to. Ee- cherehes Anatomiques sur le Systoine Veineux, fol. avec Flanchcs. 4 xVENOUS SYSTEM. 1410 1. The anterior superficial spinal (or rachi- dian) veins, include, according to this au- thority, the vena azygos major, the vena azygos minor, the trunk of the right and left superior intercostal veins, the lumbar and ilio-lumbar veins, and the lateral and middle sacral veins. 2. The posterior superficial spinal veins, " form an exceedingly complicated network, the meshes of which surround the spinous processes and lamina?, and the transverse and articular processes of all the vertebra?." B. The deep or intraspinal veins comprise the following : — 1. The veins of the bodies of the vertebras ; 2. The great anterior longitudinal veins or sinuses (Willis) ; 3. The posterior spinal veins and plexuses; all these are external to the " theca verte- bralis:" and 4. The veins of the spinal cord itself; in- ternal to the theca vertebralis. Superficial sj)inal veins. — The anterior super- ficial spinal veins have been already described as constituting a part of the azygos system. The posterior superficial sjmial veins (the dorsi-spinal veins of Dupnytren and Breschet) are derived from the muscles which fill the vertebral grooves, and thus cover the laminae and the spinous and transverse processes with a series of anastomosing vessels. In the neck they form a complicated plexus, from which proceed two large veins (posterior jugular, Cruveilhier), which communicate freely with the vertebral veins, and join the venae in- nominatse. From the numerous venous circles and plexuses formed by the "dorsi-spinal " veins, communicating branches are given off, which perforate the ligamenta subflava, or pass through the intervertebral foramina, and unite freely with the deep spinal veins. Deep spinal veins. — 1. Veins of the bodies of the verfebrcs: (veines basi-verlebrales, Bres- chet), [vide .Kg. 361. Vol. III. p. 630.], are contained in bony canals in the bodies of all the vertebrae, and are analogous to the diploic veins of the cranium. The basi-vertebral veins originate in the canallated tissue of the bone, and form larger trunks, which converge towards the posterior surfaces of the bodies of the vertebras, where the orifices of the bony canals in which they are contained are very apparent; on emerging from the vertebras these veins form a plexus (transverse plexus) interposed between the bones and the pos- terior common ligament of the spine, and from which veins pass laterally to terminate in the anterior longitudinal sinuses. Some of the smaller venous canals pass forwards to cpen on the anterior surface of the vertebral column, where they anastomose with the su- perficial veins. 2. The anterior longitudinal sinuses, Willis : (grandes veines rachidiennes longitudinales an- terieures, Breschet), [vide Fig. 360. p. 630.] —These extend the entire length of the ver- tebral column, under the form of two longi- tudinal veins situated within the spinal canal, along the external margins of the posterior common ligament, and consequently between the bodies of the vertebras and the dura mater, (hence sometimes termed meningo- rachidian veins). Opposite every vertebra these longitudinal vessels are connected to each other by the transverse plexus of the basi-vertebral veins, whilst externally they communicate, by means of branches which pass through the series of intervertebral fora- mina, with the numerous veins which ramify on the exterior of the spinal column, viz., the; vertebral, azygos, intercostal, lumbar, sacral, &c. These longitudinal venous channels are neither parallel to each other, nor are they of uniform dimensions; opposite the bodies of the vertebras they are most closely approxi- mated, whilst corresponding to the interver- tebral foramina they are widely separated, as if drawn outwards by the branches which are here connected with them. Each longitudinal sinus, or " venus plexus," (for occasionally two or more veins enter into the formation of these channels on each side,) might therefore be described as formed of " a series of plexi- form arches, which embrace the pedicles of each vertebra, have their concavity directed outwards and their convexity inwards, and the extremities of which anastomose together opposite the intervertebral foramina, where they communicate with the branches on the outside of the spine." * According to Bres- chet, interruptions occasionally occur in dif- ferent parts of these longitudinal channels, a circumstance which still further authorises this description, in which each venous arch is regarded as a separate trunk, communicating with its fellows of the opposite side, and also with similar branches above and below. 3. The posterior deep spinal veins (veines longitudinales rachidiennes posterieures, Bres- chet) are likewise situated in the interior of the spinal canal, between the posterior sur- face of the dura mater and the front of the laminae. They there form a close interlace- ment of vessels (jwsterior intraspinal plexuses) which is most remarkably developed in the upper part of the canal. These veins and plexuses are joined by the posterior superficial spinal veins (dorsi-spinal veins), and they com- municate with the anterior longitudinal sinuses by numerous small lateral branches. 4. The proper veins of the spinal cord (me- dulli spinales, Breschet) are small tortuous vessels, which form an irregular plexus upon both surfaces of the medulla spinalis between the pia mater and the arachnoid membrane ; they communicate through the foramen mag- num with the petrosal sinuses or cerebellar veins, and give off small branches which pass through the foramina with the spinal nerves to establish communications with the several e.rfra-spinal veins. The veins of the spinal cord are apparently the " venae comites " of the proper spinal arteries. " The veins of the spine may be regarded, in reference to the general circulation, as es- tablishing an unbroken communication be- * Cruveilhier's Descriptive Anatomy, vol. ii. p. 808.VENOUS SYSTEM. Mil 'tween the veins of all parts of the trunk, so that we can suppose one of the vena? cavse to be obliterated without the venous circulation being interrupted. The greater azygos itself, which is generally regarded as the principal means of communication between the two venos cavse, is not, however, necessary, when we consider the arrangement of the anterior and posterior spinal plexuses. Thus, I have sometimes seen the inferior, and sometimes the superior vena cava, obliterated without any apparent increase in the diameter of the vena azygos, and, what will perhaps be thought surprising, without oedema either of the upper or lower extremities. " Supposing the vena cava ascendens to be obstructed from the entrance of the hepatic veins down to the renal veins, the blood would then flow back by the lumbar veins into the plexuses contained within the spinal canal; through these plexuses it would ascend to the vertebrocostal (intercostal) veins, from thence to the azygos veins, and through them into the superior vena cava. " If all the jugular veins were obliterated, the venous circulation in the head would still continue, and would be carried on through the spinal veins." * B. Veins which form the Interior Vena Cava. The veins which unite to form the inferior vena cava transmit the blood which is derived from the lower extremities and from the vis- cera of the pelvis and of the abdomen. I. Veins of the lower extremities.— The veins of the lower, like those of the upper extremities, are divided into a deep and a superficial set; they are likewise provided with valves, which are most numerous in the veins of the former class. Superficial veins of the lower extremities. — The small veins, which in great numbers exist in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the dorsum of the foot, unite to form two prin- cipal trunks termed saphenous. These are placed, the one on the inner, and the other on the posterior aspect of the leg. Internal or long saphena vein. — This vein first exists as a distinct vessel a little below the ankle joint, in front of which it ascends and passes along the inner surface of the leg, at the distance of half an inch from the inner margin of the tibia. At the knee it lies be- hind the internal condyle, superficial to the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semi- tendinosus muscles, and continuing to ascend on the internal and anterior surface of the thigh, gains the " saphenic opening" in the fascia lata, through which it passes backwards to end in the femoral vein, at the distance of about an inch below Poupart's ligament. In this long course the saphena vein re- ceives many cutaneous branch s, and also several communicating veins from the deep vessels. In the thigh, it is.joined, near its termination, by a large branch, which comes * Cruveilhier's Descriptive Anatomy, vol. ii. p. 810. from the back of the limb, and by two or three veins which are derived from the an- terior and external surfaces of the thigh. These latter pursue a direction upwards and inwards, and thus cross anterior to the femoral artery, so that they are liable to be injured by the incisions made to expose that artery. The trunk of the saphena vein itself is seldom thus endangered, as it ascends on a plane internal to the artery. Shortly before its termination, the saphena vein is enveloped in the meshes of the cribriform fascia, where it is joined by three cutaneous veins from the parieties of the abdomen, — viz. the superficial pubic, the superficial circumfiexa i/ii, and the superficial epigastric veins. When, from any cause, the circulation through the inferior vena cava is obstructed, those veins become remarkably enlarged and tortuous. The internal saphena vein is accompanied, from the ankle to the knee, by the internal saphena nerve. The valves, in its interior, vary from two to six sets. Communicating branches pass between this vein and the deep veins of the leg and thigh ; they are most numerous in the leg, where they connect the saphena with the anterior and posterior deep tibial veins. Posterior or external saphena vein. — The external saphena vein is formed by the union of several branches from the outer side of the foot, and ascends into the leg behind the outer ankle. Inclining inwards and upwards, it gains the centre of the back of the leg, passes superficial to the groove between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, and enters the poplitaeal region. Opposite the line of flexion of the knee-joint, this vein passes through a small round opening in the popli- teal fascia, and joins the poplitaeal vein about its centre. This vessel, sometimes called the short saphena vein, is accompanied in part of its course by the posterior saphena nerve. It is usually furnished svith two valves, which are found near the termination of the vessel. This vein communicates but rarely with the deep veins of the leg. Deep veins of the loiver extremity. — In the lower, as well as in the upper extremities, the deep system of veins is represented by the " venae comites " of the larger arteries. The satellite veins of the posterior tibial artery are derived from the deep plantar veins {external and internal'). At the upper part of the leg the posterior tibial veins are joined by the satellite veins of the peroneal, and subse- quentlv, at the lower edge of the popliteeus muscle, by those of the anterior tibial artery. By the union of these is the trunk of the poplitaeal vein formed. The poplitceal vein. — This vein is of large size, owing to the number and magnitude of the branches which it receives ; it is joined by the tibial veins, by the external saphena, by the articular, and, lastly, by muscular veins of hu ge size (sural) from the calf of the leg. The poplitaeal vein is placed posterior to its artery below, posterior and a little external to that vessel, at the upper part of the poplitaeal 4x21412 VENOUS SYSTEM. space. It is consequently situated between the artery and the posterior tibial nerve. The valves in this vein are four or five in number. Its coats are stated by Cruveilhier and others to be of more than ordinary thick- ness. The femoral vein is the continuation of the poplitceal, which latter vessel, having passed through the tendinous opening in the adduc- tor muscles, enters the thigh, and becomes femoral. In the lower third of the thigh the femoral vein and artery (enclosed in a com- mon sheath) are contained in " Hunter's canal," the vein lying, as in the ham, posterior and external to the artery. In the centre of the thigh the vein is placed directly behind the artery ; but throughout its upper third the two vessels lie side by side, and in close con- nection, the vein being the more internal. A thin, fibrous septem derived from the sheath which surrounds them passes backwards, and separates these vessels at this part of their course. The point of the aneurism needle is apt to be entangled by this partition, in con- veying a ligature round the femoral artery, if care be not taken to keep the instrument on its outer or arterial side, whilst at the same time the sheath is kept tense. At the highest point of its course, just where it is about to pass beneath Poupart's ligament, the femoral vein constitutes the external boundary of the crural ring, and would therefore neces- sarily bear the same relation to the neck of any hernial tumour which may have descended through this aperture. In its course through the thigh, the femoral vein is joined by nu- merous muscular branches, also by the profunda vein, about an inch and a half below the crural arch, and, lastly, by the internal saphena vein. Its valves are from three to five in number. Beneath Poupart's ligament the femoral becomes continuous with the external iliac vein. The external iliac vein, whilst it accom- panies the external iliac artery, and holds the same relation to surrounding parts as that vessel, is nevertheless differently related to its artery on the right and left side. As these vessels lie on the horizontal ramus of the pubis, their relative positions at both sides is the same, the vein being placed internal to the artery. On the left side this relation does not alter, and the vein lies on the inner side of the artery throughout its whole course ; on the right side, however, the vein, in its ascent, passes first behind the artery, and then appears slightly to its outer side. The interned circumflex ilii and the two deep epigastric veins join the external iliac vein at the commencement of its course im- mediately above Poupart's ligament. The former holds a remarkable relation to the ex- ternal iliac artery, for it crosses that vessel at right angles to its anterior surface, and thus separates the artery from the fascia transver- salis. The infernal iliac vein is formed in the cavity of the pelvis by the union of the veins which correspond to the numerous divisions of the internal iliac artery, —viz. by the glulaeal, sciatic, internal pudic, and obturator veins, all of which arise external to the pelvis; and by numerous branches from the viscera contained within the pelvis, and which are remarkable for their plexiform arrangement. Of these, the vesical veins form a plexus which surrounds the neck of the bladder, and the prostate gland (vesico-prostatic plexus), receives the blood from the dorsal veins of the penis, and communicates freely with the inferior hemor- rhoidal veins. In the female a similar plexus receives veins from the clitoris and the labia, and in addition there are two others, still more remarkable for their development, — the vaginal plexus, which surrounds the vagina near its commencement, and communicates with the vesical plexus in front, and with the haemorrhoidal veins behind, and the uterine plexus, the veins of which are scarcely ap- parent except during gestation, and which communicate with the ovarian veins. In both sexes the lower extremity of the rectum is surrounded by the ramifications of the hemorrhoidal plexus, the blood of which is returned to the internal iliac vein by the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal veins. This plexus likewise communicates freely with the superior hemorrhoidal veins, which unite with the inferior meseraic veins, and so constitute a part of the portal system. In all these vessels valves exist in great numbers, although none occur in the great trunks in which they terminate. The internal iliac vein on each side is in- ternal to its corresponding artery. The common iliac veins are formed by the union of the external and internal iliac veins. The junction takes place opposite the sacro- iliac symphisis. These veins exhibit on each side some interesting anatomical peculiarities. The right common iliac vein, nearly vertical in its direction, is placed posterior and external, to its corresponding artery. The left common iliac vein, larger than the preceding, and nearly transverse in its direction, lies internal, and inferior, to its corresponding artery, and crosses behind the common iliac artery of the right side. The common iliac veins usually unite upon the intervertebral substance between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebras, to form the vena cava inferior. The junction occurs to the right of the mesial line, and inferior to, as well as to the right of, the angle of bifurcation of the aorta.* The collateral branches of the common iliac veins are the following : — (a) The itio-lumbar vein.—This vein arises in the iliac fossa, by radiating branches, which * The junction of the venoe innominate to form the superior vena cava, as well as that of the com- mon iliac veins to form the inferior vena cava, oc- curs on the right of the mesial line of the body. In the former instance, the uniting veins are found on a plane anterior to the arterial trunks which they accompany; whilst in the latter they lie be- hind them.VENOUS SYSTEM. 1413 correspond in their distribution to those of the artery of the same name, and communicate freely with the lower lumbar and sacral veins. (b) The middle sacrnl vein. — A single trunk placed on the sacrum in the middle line, w hich communicates inferiorly with the vesi- cal and hemorrhoidal plexuses, and on each side with the adjacent lateral sacral veins. It usually opens into the left common iliac vein, but sometimes terminates more symmetrically, by bifurcating and giving a branch to either common iliac vein. (c) The lateral sacral veins,—These ana- stomose very freely with the middle sacral and gluteal veins, and with veins in the sacral canal, before terminating in the common iliac veins. Inferior vena cava. — (Vena cava ascen- dens.) This vein, the largest in the bod}', since it returns to the heart all the blood which is circulated below the diaphragm, is formed by the junction of the common iliac veins, just as the superior cava is constituted by that of the vena; innominatae. The abdominal vena cava passes upwards in front of the lumbar vertebra;, behind the liver and on the right side of the aorta. At first the inferior vena cava and the aorta are in close contact; but as they ascend, the vein inclines forwards and to the right side, so that in the vicinity of the dia- phragm these great blood-vessels become more and more remotely related to each other, and finally, the thoracic duct, the vena azygos, the right splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, the right cms of the diaphragm and the Spigelian lube of the liver intervene between them. The anterior relations of the inferior vena cava are the following : the peritoneum, the mesentery, the inferior portion of the duodenum, the pancreas, the commencement of the vena portce, and the liver, w hich latter sometimes iorms a complete canal for the cava. Pos- teriorly, the inferior cava corresponds to the vertebras, to the psoas muscle, and to the right renal and right lumbar arteries : exter- nally, it is related to the right kidney. The inferior vena cava is not uniform in its dimensions, for it presents two remarkable di Ufa t ions in its course, the first where it is joined by the emulgent veins, and the second, opposite to its junction with the venae cave hepaticae. Having passed behind, or through, the liver, the vena cava is transmitted through the " foramen quadratum " of the diaphragm, and at the same time penetrates the fibrous layer of the pericardium, which is here intimately connected with the cordiform tendon of the diaphragm. Above the diaphragm the vena cava bends abruptly to the left, and, after a very short, and almost transverse course within the pericardium, during which it is in- vested on its anterior surface by the serous membrane, terminates by entering the most posterior and inferior portion of the right auricle; the axis of its opening is directed upwards, backwards, and to the left side. There are no valves in this vessel. Collateral branches. — Besides the common iliac veins, which are its formative roots, the inferior vena cava receives the following, viz., the renal, spermatic, (ovarian in the female), supra renal, lumbar, inferior phrenic, and hepatic veins. (a) The renal veins are of great size, and pass transversely to join the cava ; the left is the longest; it passes in front of the aorta to arrive at its destination, and is joined by the left spermatic, vein. Both renal veins arise in the cortical sub- stance of the kidneys by small radicles, which unite into larger vessels : these pass between the " pyramids," and so gain the hilus, where they lie in front of their accompanying arteries. (6) The suprarenal, or capsular veins, are more numerous than the arteries of the same name; there are usually three veins on each side, and but one artery. The veins are the superior, which joins the inferior phrenic, a middle, which unites directly with the vena cava, and an inferior, which opens into the renal vein of its own side. (c) The spermatic veins originate in the testis, and pass through the mediastinum testis. On entering the cord they receive veins from the epididymis, and assume a loose plexiform arrangement (plexus pampinifor mis). The spermatic veins, now four or five in num- ber, pass along the cord, and traverse the in- guinal channel with the vas deferens and spermatic arteries. At the internal abdomi- nal ring the spermatic veins leave the vas deferens and accompany their corresponding arteries, lying behind the peritoneum and in front of the psoas muscle. Continuing to ascend, these veins cross the ureters external to the common iliac arteries, approximate to one another, and finally terminate, that of the right side in the vena cava, and that of the left side in the left renal vein. In the abdomen there is either one sper- matic vein, on each side, or two veins which freely communicate by short transverse branches, and unite in one common trunk before terminating. In the female these vessels are represented by the Ovarian veins, which form a plexus between the layers of the broad ligament, and ter- minate in the same manner as the spermatic veins in the male. ((/) Lumbar veins (lumbo-vertcbral veins). — There are four or five pairs of lumbar veins which are in every respect analogous to the lumbar arteries from the aorta: they arise by muscular branches in the lumbar region, and in the parieties of the abdomen, where they are connected with the epigastric veins, and on both sides pass behind the psoas muscles to open into the cava close to one another: the veins of the left side cross the spine be- hind the aorta. The lumbar veins commu- nicate very freely with the venous system of the spinal canal, with the ilio lumbar veins below, and with the commencement of the azygos veins superiorly. (e) The inferior phrenic veins are derivcj 4x31414 VENOUS SYSTEM. from the diaphragm, ami correspond accu- rately to the phrenic arteries from the aorta. The hepatic veins may be considered as forming an adjunct to the portal venous system, in connection with which they will be briefly noticed. Portal venous system.—One remarkable class of the veins of the abdomen, those of the chylopoietic viscera, do not terminate directly in the vena cava, but unite to form a large trunk — vena portce, which enters the livei-, and, branching out like an artery (hence the name vena arteriosa), forms a capillary system in the substance of that organ; The trunk of the vena partes is formed by the coalescence of several large veins, which return the blood from the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and from the entire of the intes- tinal tract, with the exception of the lower part of the rectum, many of the veins of which open into the internal iliac vein, as has been already mentioned. The veins which form the porta are the following: — the superior and inferior mesen~ teric, the sp/enic, gastric, duodenal, and pan- creatic, veins. All these at e destitute of valves. 1. Inferior mesenteric vein.— The veins of the upper portion of the rectum (superior hemorrhoidal veins), sigmoid flexure of the colon, and descending colon, unite to form this vein, which ascends behind the inferior transverse portion of the duodenum and the pancreas, and opens into the splenic vein. By means of the free communications which exist between the inferior hemorrhoidal veins and the hemorrhoidal and vesical plexuses, the system of the vena porta? is connected with that of the general systemic circulation. 2. The splenic vein arises in the spleen, and, accompanying the splenic artery (which lies superior to the vein), follows a transverse direction from left to right, and passes behind the pancreas to unite with the superior me- senteric vein. Besides its proper splenic roots the splenic vein receives the veins which correspond to the " vasa brevia," as also the epiploic, pancre- atic, and inferior mesenteric veins. The gastric veins, of which the coronary (coronaria ventricu/i) is the most considerable, likewise terminate in the splenic vein. 3. The superior mesenteric vein (grande mesaraique, C'/oquet) receives the venous ca- pillaries from the duodenum and all the small intestines, also from the ascending and trans- verse portions of the colon, and passes behind the pancreas, where it unites with the splenic vein. The superior mesenteric vein corre- sponds to the artery of the same name, and is placed anterior and to the right of it. The trunk of the vena porta;, formed by the union of these two great veins (splenic and superior mesenteric), is placed at first behind the head of the pancreas, to the right of the spinal column, and a little to the left of the inferior vena cava : it next ascends, with an obliquity backwards and to the right side, between the layers of the gastro hepatic omentum to the transverse fissure of the liver ; after becoming slightly enlarged (sinus of the vena porta), it there divides into two branches, which pass horizontally into the right and left hepatic lobes respectively. Its principal anterior relations are the follow- ing : the head of the pancreas and the duode- num, the hepatic artery, and the ductus cho- ledochus; to the two latter vessels it is related, whilst traversing the gastro-hepatie omentum ; it is surrounded by branches of lymphatic vessels and of the hepatic plexus of nerves. The portal veins, and their subdivisions in the liver, surrounded by a prolongation from the capsule of Glisson, are contained within the " portal canals," and are each accompanied by a branch of the hepatic artery, and by a branch of the hepatic duct. From these arise the vaginal and interlobular branches, which, by their inosculations, form plexuses which are similarly named. The interlobular veins sur- round the lobules on their capsular surfaces, and ultimately, having been joined by the terminal branches of the hepatic artery, enter the lobules (forming the interlobular veins), and terminate by inosculating with the intralobu- lar (hepatic) veins: "this plexus interposed between the interlobular portal veins and the intralobular hepatic vein constitutes the venous part of the lobule, and may be called the lobular venous plexus." — (Kicrnan.) " The portal vein collects the venous blood from the chylopoietic v^cera, and then circu- lates it through the lobules : it likewise re- ceives the venous blood, which results from the distribution of the hepatic artery to the struc- tures of the liver: these two sources of supply constitute the two origins of the portal vein, the abdominal origin and the hepatic origin."* The blood conveyed to the liver by the branches of the vena porta? is convej ed hack again into the general circulation by the he- patic veins. Hepatic veins. — These veins arise in each lobule, from the lobular venous plexus, by a vein termed, from its position, intralobular. The intralobular veins unite with others termed sublobidar, which, by their coalescence from the venae cava? hepatica?, these latter, usually four in number, leave the liver at its thick margin, and open into the vena cava inferior, where that vein passes between the Spigelian and right lobes of the liver. C Cardiac Veins. The proper veins of the heart form a sepa- rate system of small extent, which communi- cates with the right auricle of the heart by the great cardiac vein. Their principal trunks are thus distinguished : ]. Great cardiac vein (anterior or great co- ronary vein). — This vein commences on the anterior surface of the heart, near its apex, and ascends in the anterior interventricular groove, as far as the base of the ventricles, where, bending abruptly to the left, it gains the hack of the heart by passing round the left margin of the organ in the deep horizontal groove between the left auricle and the left * Vide Vol. III. p. 1G8., Ai t. Liver.VESiCULA PR0STAT1CA. 1415 ventricle. Still observing a transverse direc- tion, the vein in its farther course, passes from left to right, crosses the upper extremity of the posterior interventricular groove, and finally opens into the posterior surface of the right auricle to the right of the mesial line. • Before its termination, the great coronary vein presents a bulbous dictation (sinus of the coronary vein). Its orifice in the right auricle, which is protected by a special valve ( valve of Thebesius or lesser Eustachian value), is situated between the great Eustachian valve and the right auriculo venticular opening. Posterior cardiac vein (posterior or lesser coronary vein).—The lesser cardiac vein arises near the apex of the heart, on its posterior surface, and ascends in the posterior interven- tricular groove, where it is joined by muscular branches from either side. Finally, it ter- minates in the great coronary vein when that vessel forms its ampulla in the deep groove above the base of the ventricles. Several small veins, which belong exclu- sively to the right ventricle, ascend along the right border of the heart, and, curving round in the groove between the right ventricle and right auricle, likewise join the great coronary vein — one of those which has long been dis- tinguished by the name of the " vein of Galen," is stated to communicate, frequently, by a separate opening, witii the right auricle. Other veins of extreme minuteness (vence minimce or veins of Thebesius) are described as opening separately at various points into either auricle. Their existence is denied by some anatomists. (B. Geo. M< Dowel.) VERTEBRAL COLUMN.— (Sec Sup- plement.) VESICULA PROSTATICA. (Syn. 55- Kus •prostata:; sinus pocularis; tiiriculus pro- bations; vesicula prostatica media sen spuria; uterus mascu/iuus; Corpusculum Weberi- asum.) The tubular structure indicated by this name is a part of the male sexual ap- paratus in Mammalia. It lies between the lower ends of the seminal ducts, and opens between them, by a special aperture, into the commencement of the urino-genital canal : an opening which has been usually, but not quite correctly, viewed as an immediate process of the urethra. In Man, in whom alone it was recognised until a few years ago, it is a little vesicle, which is covered by the prostate. A si- milar form and arrangement recurs in many mammalia: but others exhibit very consider- able deviations. Sometimes it is altogether absent, or is but very rudimentary ; while in other instances it is of considerable size. Its relation to the prostate is equally variable ; but even in man it is oniy superficial, being solety due to its local arrangement. On these grounds, the name " vesicula pro- statica," which at any rate merely applies to its human anatomy, cannot always be used. We prefer, therefore, to use that of " the Weberian organ or corpuscle," a name which has been lately proposed in order constantly to recall the great service which an eminent anatomist has rendered to our knowledge of this remarkable structure. E. II. Weber was the first who recognised the great morphological import of this organ, and who adduced proofs that in man and the male mammalia it is the rudiment of an organ which, by a great development in the female individual, determines the form and physiological relations of her generative ap- paratus. Weber* explained the vesicula pro- statica as the analogue of the uterus, and gave it the name of the uterus masculinus. We would willingly accept this denomi- nation, if Weber's view were quite correct. But since we shall hereafter point out that this never specifies the full morphological value of the vesicula prostatica, but is, in many cases, erroneous, we prefer the nomen- clature already mentioned. Our examination of the Weberian corpuscle is divisible into three sections. The first regards its variations of form ; while the second considers the ques- tion of its possible functional import; and the third has for its object to determine the mor- phological value of this structure. I. Anatomy. — The Weberian corpuscle occurs only in the class Mammalia, where we meet with a greater complication of the sexual apparatus than in any other group of the Vertebrata. Thus the Mammalia are the only vertebrate animals whose females possess a real vagina and uterus. What we desig- nate by this name in some other Vertebrata cannot be regarded as morphological equi- valents of the vagina and uterus of Mammalia. Man. — The Weberian corpuscle is a small flask-shaped vesicle, with a rounded blind end and a narrow neck directed downwards, placed on the hinder wall of the urethra, under the verumontanum, and covered by the prostate. The middle lobe of this gland limits the upper end of the corpuscle. The length varies, but is commonly 3, 4 or 6 lines; the breadth at the upper end is 2 lines, but it sometimes attains a more considerable size. Thus Adamsf men- tions an instance in which it had a length of an inch, and by its upper end, which projected free, was placed upon the dorsal surface of the middle lobe of the prostate. And in the hypospadian described by TheileJ; its size was yet more considerable (1 J-inches). The constricted neck sometimes forms half of the whole corpuscle, and is, according to Huschke$, sometimes separated from the 4 Annot. anat. et ptrysiol. zu Kretzschmar's Diss, inang. circa lineam physioL morbor.

The orifices of the two ejaculatory ducts * lie right and left of the opening, at a very small distance from it, usually somewhat higher, yet never quite symmetrical: they are sometimes close to it, or somewhat behind it. These ducts pass up the sides of the Weberian organ, and receive it between them, being bound up with it by areolar tissue. Fig. 873. Man (copied from Weber's Zusatzen.') a.

It became thinner in its ascent, so as to be only permeable by a hog's bristle, and ended as a solid thread, which separated by bifurcating. Morgagni | was the first who accurately described the Weberian organ, which he also probably discovered. Of fifteen human bodies which he examined with this object, he found it in fourteen. It is possible that in the one remaining case he overlooked it, since it sometimes happens that its mouth is but small, or is even altogether deficient, as Buschke has frequently ascertained it in healthy and robust suicides. Nevertheless it is not improbable that in some cases there is a complete absence of the Weberian corpuscle; the less so that we sometimes verify such dif- rences in other animals. In two of these fifteen cases, Morgagni found that the utri- culus, instead of opening by a special aperture, communicated with one of the ejaculatory * See Prostate, Vol. IV. fig. 103. | Zur Morphologie der Ham- u.

But at all events this is a rare ano- maly, which has been since observed by Adams only.* In a case mentioned by Hyrtlf, there was a simultaneous deficiency of both vesiculae seminales, and the ejaculatory ducts descended into the upper end of a single receptacle, which was one inch long and seven lines broad. But though Hyrtl and Theile regarded this structure as certainly an uterus masculinus, and thus as a Weberian organ; yet the in- sertion of the ejaculatory ducts at the upper end is a circumstance which contradicts their view. As we shall hereafter show, such a con- nection is a morphological impossibility. Even where an immediate communication between the vasa deferentia and the Weberian cor- puscle exists (as is normally the case in the hare), it occurs only at the inferior extremity of the latter organ.

It here in- closes a small, narrow and flat canal, which above has a blind extremity, and scarcely possesses a greater width than at its lower end. Its length is about two lines. Its mouth, in the uro-genital canal, is surrounded as with a wall by an annular swelling, which has some resemblance to a small os tinea?, and in which one may also, generally, dis- tinguish an anterior and posterior lip. Im- mediately behind this opening are the mouths of the ejaculatory ducts, the lower ends of which are apposed to the hinder wall of the corpuscle, and are covered by the prostate. As far as my researches go J, the above description will apply to the Weberian organ in all Apes. At least I have found it thus in Inuus Ci/nomolgus (in whom it was formerly described by BergmanntJ), in Inuus nemes- trinus, Cynocephalus Maimon, and a species of Harpaie (Harpale Iacc/nts?) which, with all the animals I examined, was placed at my * Adams, loc. cit. p. 153. t Oesterreiche Medic.

VolitanUa.— Among the Bats I have found a Weberian organ hitherto only in Vespertilio murinus. Here it is a small corpuscle, scarcely- one line in size, between the ejaculatory ducts. It is covered by the prostate, and opens at the usual place by a small and scarcely visible aperture. In Flecotus auritus I have sought after it in vain. So also in Galeopilhecus variegatus, where the points of opening of the two seminal ducts are placed close together upon a small and elongated verumontanuni. Insectivora. — The Erinaceus Europceus Ttdpa Europcea*, Sorex araucus, and Macro- scelides Rozeti were examined : only in the last is a Weberian organ present. It is a roundish flask, which is proportionately of a very considerable size, being fully one line long, and quite as broad at the end. It opens, by means of a short constricted neck, into the uro-genital canal between the two seminal ducts. The prostate, which consists, as in the Sorex, of two compound gland-tubes, lies in front of the utriculus, and close to it, but without covering it. The thickened lower ends of the seminal ducts receive it between them, and are united to it by areolar tissue. Ferae.—In the dog and the cat the Weberian organ forms, as Weber has shown, a long small bladder of some lines in size, which is, for the most part, placed before the prostate in a fold of peritoneum stretching between the two ejaculatory ducts. There is no open- ing into the urethra. The description of Weberf certainly holds good in many instances, yet not in all. I have examined numerous dogs and cats, and have very frequently found, instead of a vesi- cular structure, a simple solid cylindrical cord, which I have regarded as an obliterated ru- diment of the organ. In many individuals even this could not be detected. I also found the Weberian organ as a solid cord in the fox and leopard. The striped hyaena, on the contrary, possesses an elongated flask- shaped Weberian corpuscle; but it, together with the ends of the seminal ducts, is hidden between the two kidney-shaped halves of the large prostate.^ The latter are only fused posteriorly ; in the larger anterior half they are united by areolar tissue into a common mass. There is no opening into the uro- genital canal, and I have found none in any of the beasts of prey examined. The Weberian organ of the otter, which * The commencement of the uro-genital canal in the Eimacera and Talpa, forms in an anomalous manner a spacious and denned cavity. Into this cavity the urethra opens, as in the female mammalia, by a narrow slit-shaped aperture. This was de- si-rihed by me some time ago (zur Anatomie, &c, SS. 102. 105.) at which period I erroneously ex- plained the cavitv as a male vagina. t Zusatze, &c."Tab. VII. j The length of the prostate is fully one and a half inches: its breadth is yet larger. Cowper's glands are also of considerahle size, two inches long. They have a Iongly clavate form, and a very thick covering of striped muscular fibres. Fig. 875.

Leydig* has described, is of unusual form, and much more considerable development. It lies between the urinary bladder and the two seminal ducts, and consists of a body about six lines in length and propor- tional breadth, the upper free end of which is drawn out right and left into a long and thin thread lying on the seminal duct. The cavities and their openings could not be ex- amined ; but without doubt both were pre- sent. The Weberian organ is very similar in the Meles Taxus. It is a very considerable cylinder, which measures about ten lines, and rises to the hinder surface of the glandular ends of the vasa deferentia, being very firmly united to them by areolar tissue. The upper end is folded into two horns, only the right of which is permeable to a short distance. The left is, from its root onwards, a solid thin thread, which is closely attached to the Fig. 876.

Its cavity is that of a canal, but not so wide a one as might be guessed from the exterior thickness of the body ; and it opens by a distinct aper- ture on the verumontanum. Pinnipedia.— The genitals of a young male seal, probably Phoca vitulina, were examined by me. Here I saw a scarcely visible linear fold, which led to a longish Weberian organ of about two lines in size. The fold lay close behind a small ridge-shaped verumontanum, on which were the orifices of the vasa defe- rentia, situated close to each other. As in the dog, the organ is situated partly in front of, partly beneath, a prostate, which in form and development also corresponds with that gland in the dog. Marsupialia. — In Didelphys Virginiana the only animal of this order who.se male genitals I had, no trace of the Weberian corpuscle was present. Rudcnlla. — The Weberian organ showed mantis, and Hypudceus ampMbitts, I have looked for it in vain. But certainly the My- o.vus Vitela, Dipus JEgyptiacus and Cricelus vulgaris exhibited a single small longitudinally- folded verumontanum, which, from its situa- tion between the two orifices of the vasa de- ferentia, must have been the opening of a Weberian organ : but this structure iself, on account of its sheer minuteness and hidden situation, eluded the further searches, which were made in only a few individuals. In Cavia cobayn the Weberian organ is, as I described it some time since*, a small roundish vesicle, scarcely a line in size, which has a bilobed extremity, and, as in Macro- scelides, a constricted neck, which opens into the uro-genital canal between the two seminal ducts. The Weberian organ of the rabbit and hare is very much larger. It was formerly known to the older zootomists under the name of the azygous seminal vesicle f, and has only received a more accurate description and ex- Fie. 877.

In the rabbit this organ attains a length of from one to one and a half inches, so that it * Zur Anatomic, &c. p. 104. t See fig. 281. Art. Rodentta, Vol. IV. p. 393.

It has the form of a flask, and in its anterior half, which is compressed somewhat flat, it has a breadth of five to six lines. Its base is bi- lobed, as if drawn out into two lateral short and rounded horns. Its mouth in the uro- genital canal is wide (about one line), jet not round or linear, but rather placed across, and somewhat arched in shape, as if bent around the swelling of the verumontanum. In new- born individuals the organ is much smaller, scarcely three lines long; but it is otherwise exactly similar. In the male hare it is al- ways smaller. In one example it measured five lines, and was devoid of horns at the base ; but these are sometimes little developed in the rabbit also. But the most extraordi- nary circumstance about the utriculus of these animals is this, that it receives the ejaculatory ducts. In all other instances, these open in- dependently, by its sides, into the uro-genital canal ; but here, departing from this rule, they open into the undermost part of the Weberian organ, at a short distance (in the new-born rabbit half a line, in the adult two lines) above its orifice previously described. They occupy the anterior wall of the organ, on which they course downwards, and each terminates in a small papilla. In Lagomis the same arrangement seems to occur. At least Pallas* states of the Lagomis ogstona that the two ejaculatory ducts open together by a common tube, which must doubtless be regarded as a Weberian organ, -j- Another very remarkable form of Weberian organ is possessed by the beaver. The first information concerning it we owe to Brandt and RatzeburgJ, who compared this struc- ture, on account of its form, to the uterus bicornis of the female individual, yet without recognising any nearer relation between the two. They regarded it as a kind of sup- plementary seminal vesicle. Its correct inter- pretation is due to the acuteness of Weber.jJ The Weberian organ is simple only at its lower end, or that which usually opens be- tween the orifices of the two vasa deferentia. Very soon it is split into two horns, which ascend in the peritoneal fold between the two seminal ducts, and finally, after they have dwindled to the form of threads, are apposed to these. Brandt and Ratzeburg were able to follow the terminal threads to the testicles; while in the example which Weber inves- tigated, where the horns measured 2^ inches, they ceased much earlier. The lower half of the horn is of very considerable thickness, as * Nov. Spec, quadruped, e glirium ordine. Erlan- gen, 1778, p. 67. f According to Rymer Jones (loc. cit. p. 393.), the two vasa deferentia in the Agouti also open b}' a common duct into a cavity of the verumontanum. But since this at the same time receives the excre- tory ducts of the seminal vesicles, it certainly is not the cavity of the Weberian organ. Probably the same structure is repeated here which I formerly (loc. cit. p. 130.) described in the Cavia, and have recently found in the Dipus. % Medizinische Zoologie. Band I. S. 137. § Amtlicher Bericht., &c., loc. cit. much as four lines, and it encloses a spacious cavity. Edentata. — The sloth (Bradyptis tridac tyhis), the only animal of this class of Mam- malia whose genitals I was able to examine, is completely devoid of this organ. Pachijdermata—Duvernoy* mentions the Weberian organ in the elephant as a deep, blind sac, which lay concealed in the veru- montanum. In the swine it has been tie- scribed by Weber. It consists here of a body, which is nine lines in length and almost a line in thickness, and which lies in the peritoneal fold between the two ejaculatory ducts. At its upper end it passes on either side into a yet longer but thinner horn. Leydig, who also mentions the opening of this body into the uro-genital canal, states that, when in the inflated condition, it has the thickness of a goose quill. In an adult boar with hypospadias, I found this organ of yet larger size. The opening, which lay between the points of aperture of the two ejaculatory ducts, and had a length of l-l lines, led into a cylindrical body, which, gradually dilating to some extent as it passed upwards, finally, after a course of fourteen lines, split into two horns. These were placed against the seminal ducts, and, as cords of areolar tissue, could be followed with the cover- ings of those tubes to the testicles. In other instances the Weberian organ of the pig ex- perienced a more considerable reduction. Thus in a new-born individual whom I ex- amined, I found only a single solid cord in the middle line of the peritoneal fold between the vasa deferentia ; it had neither cavity nor opening into the uro-genital canal. Solidungula.— The Weberian organ of the horse, which is generally of very considerable size, was known to Cuvier+, who referred it to the vesicula seminalis. It has also been fre- quently described and figured by Gui lt J as a median seminal vesicle. The first who re- cognised its morphological importance was Hausmann.§ With a reference to the older researches of Weber upon the vesicula pro- statica of man and the beaver, but before this author had published his later observations on the horse, he explained it as the male uterus. And independently of him, Adams || was led to the same result. The Weberian organ of the horse is a wide tube, which opens into the uro-genital canal by a large opening between the two vesicuiae seminales, the ejaculatory ducts of which it receives by the constricted neck of its lower extremity. In particular instances this open- ing is, as Leydig observed, divided by a median bridge into two apertures, which lie close to * Cuvier, Lecons d'Anatomie compare'e, nouv. edit. t. viii. p. 210. j- Cuvier, Lecons d'Anatomie compare'e, nouv. edit. t. viii. p. 176. % Anatomie der Hussaaugethieren, Berlin, 1834, Th.

In the same manner Gurlt found that the Weberian organ, instead of opening by a special aperture, sometimes communicated with one or other of the eja- culatory ducts. The lower end of the tube is considerably dilated for a length of 1 to 3 inches. Above, this dilated part gene- rally passes into a narrow cylinder, which Ruminantia.— In the Llama, which pos- sesses a heart-shaped parenchymatous pro- state, I have been unable to find either a median, single, opening into the commencement of the uro-genital canal, or a Weberian organ. But, on the other hand, one finds a very dis- tinct rudiment in the new-born male deer.* Here it courses as a single cord-like thread in the peritoneal fold between the two eja- Fig. 878. Weberian Organ of the Ass (reduced in size.) a, a, vasa deferentia, with the seminal vesicles, b, b; c, Weherian orgati. sometimes attains a length of 5 to 7 inches, and then divides into two short and usually unequal horns. Not unfrequently this upper part is, as was observed by Leydigand seen by myself, a simple solid thread. In the instance described by Weber the cavity was altogether absent; and an absence of the whole Webe- rian organ has been observed by Leydig. In the male ass I have also seen a very con- derable Weberian organ {Jig. 878), the existence of which I was first made aware of by Berg- mann. It is here a straight canal, four and a half inches long, which ascends in the peri- toneal fold between the two ejaculatory ducts, and tlivides at its extremity into two, much wider, horns. These have blind ends, and a length on the right side of 5, on the left of 9, lines. There is no opening into the uro- genital canal, but the lower end has a vesi- cular dilatation of four lines in length, and is separated by a longitudinal fold into two blind sacs lying close behind each other. dilatory ducts until finally it bifurcates at about an inch from the place of their inser- tion. It is only during the earlier stage of embryonic life that I have been able to find a cavity and its opening: in the new-born in- dividual the Weberian organ is already ob- literated and solid. Some larger and smaller hydatidous vesicles which are found in its course, and especially at the site of its bifur- cation, are the only relics of this its earlier condition. The same form of Weberian organ is re- peated in the goat; but its development seems here to be very variable. I examined a large number of genitals, which had been preserved some time in spirit. In all, the Weberian organ was of considerable size and develop- ment. Nevertheless I have reasons for the conjecture that this is not the rule, and that * See my description in the Gottingische Gelehrte Anzeige, 1848, No. 174.1421 VESICULA PROSTATICA. Fur. 87!).

Weberian Organ of the Goat, a, a, seminal ducts; b, b, seminal vesicles; c, Weberian organ. in the majority of he-goats a less complete development of the Weberian organ occurs. According to my observations the organ consists of a cylindrical body, which ascends between the two seminal ducts, and is strongly united to these by areolar tissue, especially in its inferior half. Alter a course of an inch and a half it splits into two horns, which are apposed to the seminal ducts, and continue with these to the testicles, where they pass into the covering of the epididymis. In two instances the lower third of the body was dilated into a longish vesicle of about three lines in diameter, while the part above this measured scarcely one line. At the seat of bifurcation it was again dilated, though less considerably. In one individual the middle portion was obliterated so as to form a solid cord. The point of opening into the uro-genital canal is a small linear fold, which is separated by a short interval from the orifices of the vasa deferentia, and is usually placed below, but, in one instance, above them. The genitals examined were those of either new-born individuals, or of such as were but a few weeks old. In two instances, which were in no way distinguished by a special development of the Weberian organ, the uro- genital canal was wider and shorter than normal, measuring from 2 to 2i inches long only, instead of about 4 inches, while the penis was smaller, and twisted into numerous zigzags or spirals. But in other respects the male organs were quite perfectly developed; the urethra opened at the extremity of the penis, and the testicles bad descended into the scrotum. In the sheep there is no Weberian organ. Even in the new-born individual, neither its opening nor any other indication of it can be found. But in the bullock I found immediately under the orifice of the vasa deferentia a small and scarcely noticeable roundish aperture, through which a probe penetrated about two lines in depth, evidently into the tubular cavity of a small Weberian organ, which was covered by the heart-shaped mass of the pro- state.

It lies in the prostate, beneath the conspicuous * Zur Anatomie, Sec., S. 100.VESICULA PP-.OSTATICA. 1422 verumontanum, and possesses a flask-shaped cavity of about one inch in depth. The open- ing at the lower declivity of the verumon- tanum is a fissure which has the shape of a horse-shoe curved forwards, while a triangular papilla, which arises from its posterior mar- gin projects into it. In the Monodon the latter is farther separated by a linear fissure. In a dolphin (Delphinus area ?) which I ex- amined, the anterior extremity of this papilla was united with the opposite margin ; so that the opening was divided into two fissures converging superiorly. In the same way Leydig observed it in Delphinus phocana; while in another individual of the same species I have met with the condition previously de- scribed. Possibly in younger individuals of the Cetacea the Weberian organ has a yet greater development. At least Eschricht, who was not aware of the structure just described, states* that, in a male embryo of the Plerobakcna, the inferior extremity of both vasa deferentia was connected with a transverse fold, of which the free margins exhibited the appearance of an obliterated cord. From its situation this would about correspond to the lateral horns of an uterus. II. Physiology. — We, now, proceed to enquire what is the use of this structure, the occurrence and variable forms of which we have hitherto been treating of. It is a general law that the physiological import of an organ stands in a direct relation with its anatomical development. If we regard the Weberian organ in this point of view, we shall soon be convinced, from its absence in many Mam- malia, and from the varieties of Us develop- ment in particular individuals, that its in- fluence upon life cannot be very important. When Morgagni first discovered the human Weberian organ, he thought that it was con- nected with the prostate. Its situation made him think it possible that some tubes of the prostate emptied themselves into it, and that it was in a certain manner, like the gall- bladder, a saccular dilatation of the excretory duct of the prostate. But anatomical research soon convinced him that his conjecture was necessarily erroneous. A communication be- tween the prostate and the Weberian organ never exists, and is indeed rendered impossible by an arrangement like that which obtains in the horse, the goat, and the beaver. According to other views, the Weberian organ has the function of a seminal receptacle. Tims it has received the name of a vesicula seminalis. But we know how prone the earlier anatomists were to this designation, and how they indicated in this manner all those accessories of the male genitals of Mammalia which opened near, or together with, the ejaeulatory duets, without any closer acquaintance with their structure and import. More recent researches f have corrected us on this point. They have shown us that the * TJntersuchungen iiber die nordischen Wallthiere, Liepzig, 1849, S. 102. f Leydig, 1. c. dependent structures known as the dual se- minal vesicles of the vasa deferentia almost always possess a glandular texture, and never, or only occasionally (as in man), contain spermatozoa. It is true that the flask-shaped seminal vesicles of the horse and ass are genuine reservoirs of sperm, ■— as we may conclude from the fact, that the vasa defe- rentia open into them, — but as a rule exactly the reverse relation obtains. But the same anatomical arrangement as that of the vesicula seminalis in the horse may be seen in the Weberian organ* of the hare previously mentioned. On this ground only one might conclude a similar functional import. And the microscope really brings proof that the contents of the Weberian organ are, in this instance, sperm. But the connection of the excretory duct and the Weberian organ is limited to the hare and lagomys. In all the other Mammalia the two structures open near to each other without any communication. Now if, in spite of this, the Weberian organ has the function of a seminal receptacle, this can only happen by the sperm, which has been previously poured into the urethra, being discharged through the lower aperture of the Weberian organ into its interior. We will not quite deny the possibility of such an occurrence; but the probability of it seems but small. At any rate a contraction of the muscular layer around the urethra would be necessary thereto; but, without offer- ing any new hypothesis, it would scarcely be possible to perceive why the sperm should thus be sent upwards rather than downwards. The verumontanum alone would not be able to prevent this. Such considerations would be silenced by direct observation; but hitherto no one has ever met with real semen in the Weberian organ, except in the hare. Morgagni states, that on pressing the human vesiculag seminales, he has seen sperm exude from the prostatic utricle. But the correctness of this state- ment is rendered very doubtful by the fact, that the examination was made at a time when the accurate diagnosis of semen was not yet understood. A fluid may certainly have exuded from the Webe'ian organ, but that it was sperm is very doubtful. It might easily form the contents of the Weberian organ, where, as is sometimes the case, this has an abnormal communication with one or the other vas deferens. I will not bring forward further arguments against the import of the Weberian organ as a seminal vesicle, such as its little capacity in many instances, &c. They would only prove that such a function is sometimes impossible. A third theory of the function of the vesi- cula prostatica has been lately suggested by Weber. According to this view it is a kind of valvular ventricle, by which the urine * As has been also remarked by Leydig. II. Meckel, on a priori grounds, wrongly denies this connection in the hare.142.3 VESICULA PROSTATICA. * Op. Cit. p. 49. pletely developed, and possesses an internal is hindered from penetrating the vasa defe- rentia. In order to this, the urine must, like the semen in the previous view, enter into the vesicle, which, distended by it, must by its own pressure close the ejaculatory canals. Hence the same difficulties recur as in the first case. Since the urethra contains urine only during the act of micturition, and is at other times empty and collapsed, this fluid must, even in its passage through the tube by which it is discharged, pass into the vesi- culu: a fact which is the less supposable, inasmuch as to this end a backward move- ment of the urine would be necessary. Be- sides in many cases the situation of the Weberian organ is such that, even if distended by a fluid, it could not possibly operate in such a way. And moreover, even where it might perhaps be possible, it seems unneces- sary, since the tumid or papillary margins of the orifices of the vasa deferentia are suf- ficiently closed by the passage of the urine itself. One other conjecture of the physiologi- cal value of the Weberian organ still remains to us, — viz. that it is a secretory appa- ratus. It was found by the older anatomists that here and there, for instance in the horse, it was filled with a thick fluid, mostly of a yellow tint. As was previously remarked, this can only be secreted by the coats of the Weberian organ. Morgagni mentioned that the inner clothing of the organ was a mucous membrane, and possessed a glandular texture ; and the later researches of Huschke and Leydig have succeeded in verifying a number of small glands therein. These glandules have a different form in the different animals ; for instance, in the rabbit they are simply spherical ; in the boar they are elongated tubes provided with buds and processes. Whether such glandules always exist in the Weberian organ must be verified by further careful researches. Leydig could not find them in the dolphin, nor could I in the dog. At any rate they are absent where, as in the deer, &c, the cavity has disappeared. Exteriorly to this mucous membrane, which possesses a layer of cylindrical cells as an epithelium, there is a layer of smooth mus- cular fibres, which take tiie longitudinal di- rection. In the hare only, in whom they form a considerable layer, especially at the lower end, they are more twisted together. It is evident that this latter arrangement is connected with the import of their Weberian organ as a seminal vesicle. At all events they are thus susceptible of more powerful contractions, which one may produce in the recently dead animal by galvanic and other stimuli for a considerable time. Together with these muscular fibres there is a quantity of areolar tissue with white and yellow fibres. This sometimes predominates, and where the cavity disappears, it seems to occur alone. It can no longer be doubted that the Weberian organ, at least where it is com- cavity and an opening, may prepare a secre- tion ; but the nature and physiological import of the secretion are as yet unknown to us. H. Meckel* states, that he once found a clear vitreous mass in the Weberian organ of the rabbit, which from its re-actions was gelatine. Nevertheless it is very improbable that the secretion always consists of this sub- stance, at least if I can judge from its external physical properties. This secretion may easily be carried away from time to time with the urine or the sperm. Whether it plays any further part — whether it is possibly, like the secretion of the prostate, subservient to the dilution of the semen (as may be conjectured from the arrangement of the Weberian organ in the hare) or to other purposes, we know not. After all, however, the function of the secretion can scarcely be an important one. III. Morphology. — It is impossible that we should be quite satisfied with what we have learnt above concerning the physiological value of the Weberian organ. Granting that, in some instances, it serves as a seminal re- ceptacle, that in others it delivers up the pro- duct of secretion, still its essential import is certainly not thus exhausted. It seems that the application of the Weberian organ to this or that end is but a casual result of its general situation, rather than that it constitutes a sufficient reason for its presence. We are constrained to adopt such a view by the cir- cumstance, that the Weberian organ is fre- quently devoid of all connection with other structures, and is even sometimes reduced to a ligamentous thread, the functional value of which one cannot imagine. Thus the Weberian organ takes a rank amongst that class of structures which possess not so much a prominent functional value, as a morphological import ; which are neces- sitated not so much by the actual require- ments of life as by the general typical plan of the structure. Should any one deny tiie existence of such a class of structures, it would only be necessary to remind him of the wing-stumps of many apterous insects, of the bony girdle for the extremities of the blind worm, of the embryonal teeth in the bearded whale. All these are parts which are of scarcely any physiological value to the animals named, although, under different cir- cumstances, and in other animals they fulfil the most important functions: they are simply- morphological rudiments, which, according to the common architectonic law, are repeated even where they are useless. But such parts are found, not merely in particular animals and groups, but also es- pecially in the different sexes. Of what use to the male individual are the milk-glands and teats ? of what use to the female the well- known rudimentary penis called the clitoris ? Are they not the plainest indications that the male and female organs are constructed after a common type, and that it is only by different developments of the same elements that theyVESICULA PROSTATICA. 1 124 take their different forms, and with these their different destinies ? Careful contem- plation leads us to regard the Weberian organ as one of this class of structures. As was previously mentioned, Weber had pointed out, that by its situation and connection with the tiro-genital canal, and very frequently (as in the beaver) by its form, it corresponds so completely to the uterus of the female mam- malia, that there is every reason for regarding it as its morphological equivalent in the male individual. According to this view, the difference be- tween the Weberian organ and the uterus is limited to that of a lesser or greater degree of development. In the female individual it becomes the receptacle of the embryo. The physiological task which it thereby under- takes demands a complete development, while in the male individual, in whom it has not such an important functional import, and is only occasionally applied to this or that sub- ordinate purpose, it undergoes a check, or even retrogrades in development. The dif- ferent degree of this checked or retrograde metamorphosis, depending on its different application, conditionates the difference of its anatomical development. In many male in- dividuals it completely disappears ; in others it remains an useless relic of a rudimentary character, while in others it assumes a more considerable size and development. The form of the receptacle of the embryo, •which, despite many varieties, is in general very constant, is connected with its functional import. But the Weberian organ is devoid of so specific an object. What wonder, then, that we find it more freely submitted to the play of the formative process, and that its form and development are even subject to manifold varieties in particular individuals? The theory of Weber at once gives us a sufficient explanation of the different anato- mical circumstances of this notable organ ; and in like manner it affords a new and secure basis for the efforts of anatomists to deter- mine the analogy — i. e. the common plan of structure—of the male and female organs. Ever since Aristotle and Galen, vain at- tempts have been made to discover an indica- tion of the uterus in the male of the Mam- malia; and sometimes this structure, sometimes that—now the vesicula seminalis, and now the prostate — has been thus regarded. The explanation given by Weber offers the first satisfactory adjustment, and at the same time promises a sufficient interpretation of the nu- merous hermaphrodite misdevelopments, or of androgyny. Weber even hints at this (and in- dependently of him Bergmann also), while he subjects the well-known case of Ackermann* to a morphological analysis f, although only with the immediate intention of further sup- porting his explanation of the vesicula pro- statica. He came to the conclusion that the * Infantis androgyni historia et iconographia, Jena?, 1805. See also Art. Hermaphroditism, Vol. II. p. 709. * Zusiitze, loc, cit. S. 13. part described by Ackermann as a cystoid uterus, the opening of which into the uro- genital canal was situated close to the efferent apertures of the vasa deferentia, was due solely to a disproportionate enlargement of the vesicula prostatica. Under such circumstances it is easily ex- plicable why the theory of Weber has re- ceived a very general assent. Huschke, Theile, Hausmann, Bergmann, Leydig, and the author in Germany, Duvernoy in France, and Adams in England, have all accepted it, and have sought to give it further stability by new re- searches. And Leydig* has further shown that the type of the glands imbedded in the wall of the Weberian body completely cor- responds with that of the uterine glands in the respective female animals. H. Meckel-)- only has expressed himself against the interpretation of Weber, although he so far agrees with it as also to see in the vesicula prostatica a rudimentary structure of chiefly morphological import ; but he explains it as being the analogue, not of the uterus, but rather of the vagina. The chief support which he adduces of this theory is the relation of the Weberian organ to the vasa deferentia and the urethra. It is well known that the older anatomists regarded the vasa deferentia as the structures which, in the female individual, discharge the functions of the Fallopian tubes. Even Weber partook of this opinion, although Midler J had already shown the morphological differ- ences of the two in birds, and Rathke§ in snakes. That this holds good of Mammalia was first maintained by Bergmann || and the author of this article \, on the ground of their comparative researches; and it was afterwards reduced to certainty by the observations of Kobelt** on the development of the genitals in the human subject. As Miiller and Rathke had previously found, Kobelt showed that, at an early date of embr3 onic life, tubes and seminal ducts exist simultaneously in all in- dividuals, but that, in the different sexes, only one of these canals attained a complete development. If the seminal and Fallopian tubes were identical structures, the Weberian theory of the morphological nature of the vesicula pro- statica could not possibly be correct; for, in that case, the former of these must constantly open into the upper end of the vesicula?, or into its two cornua respectively, which is never the case. But now that we know the difference of these two canals, the anatomical arrangement of the vasa deferentia and Weberian organ no longer constitutes an ob- jection against the explanation of the latter as the uterus. * Opus cit.

But it is not on this that Meckel chiefly relies. He conspicuously brings forward an- other argument. He states that, if with Weber we regard the vesicula prostatica as the uterus, and its opening as the os tinea?, we must in consequence consider as the vagina the beginning of the uro-genital sinus, into which open, beside the vesicula, the ejacu- latory ducts and the urethra; a view which has often occurred to the author of this article. But, in the female Mammalia, the vagina never receives the urethra. This is always inserted at the outer border of the vagina, where it passes into the short and sinus-like dilatation of the uro-genital canal (vestibu.htm, atrium vagiiite), so that the vagina always lies internally to the aperture of the urethra. Its relation to the vasa deferentia is exactly similar, as the history of their development proves that they are originally the efferent ducts of the Wolffian bodies. It is true that these latter generally disappear in the female mammal, but here and there some relics of them are left. This is especially the case in the female ruminant and pig, where they are known under the name of Gartner's canals. Here also they open, never into the vagina, but into the ductus uro-genitalis, together with the urethra. So that in all cases, after the points of opening of the urethra and vasa deferentia, the vagina comes next interiorly. And in the male mammalian the Weberian organ has this situation : it is therefore, con- cludes Meckel, the vagina, and not the uterus. While I allow the correctness of the facts brought forward by Meckel, and while,—■ against my own earlier opinion,— I have some scruples as to the unconditional accuracy of Weber's explanation, yet I cannot approve of Meckel's conclusion. The form of the Weberian organ, the bifurcation at its upper end, which occurs in so many instances, even its being imbedded in a transverse fold of peritoneum (corresponding to the broad liga- ments of the uterus) remind one too closely of the female uterus to admit of the analogy being mistaken. Now, in oriler to reconcile this circum- stance with the facts brought forward by Meckel, there remains but two expedients ; either to suppose a complete deficiency of the vagina in the male mammal (in which case the explanation of Weber would be pre- served entire), or to set forth the Weberian organ as the morphological equivalent of the vagina and uterus together. The latter of these two acceptations, which I have already defended against Meckel in another place*, finds its full confirmation in the observations on its normal anil abnormal development. On these grounds it may be advisable to review them briefly in this place. From the exposition which Rathkef has given us of the development of the vagina * Gottingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, loc. cit. j- Abhandlungen zur Bildungs- und Entwicke- Iungsgesckichte, Leipzig, 1832, S. CO. VOL. IV. and uterus, it becomes evident that these two structures at first present the appearance of a common or inseparable tube, the genital canal, which is only afterwards divided into an upper and under section by a different development of its coats, being connected with a transverse dismemberment. One of these is developed into the vagina; the other forms the uterus. At its first formation the uterus is simple: its cornua only begin later, when the tubes enter its cavity. Now, if this genital canal sustained a check of development prior to the separation of the uterus and vagina, it would remain as a simple tube, the horns of which would be either not at all or but imperfectly developed : in short, it would be a Weberian organ. In this way the observations on the normal development of the genitals do not in the least contradict the explanation of the Weberian organ as a genital canal (uterus plus vagina). It is true that we can scarcely thence deduce an absolute proof. We find it, however, in the evidence afforded by the pathological his- tory of its development, since we observe that the Weberian organ is there metamorphosed into both of these parts. I have already mentioned above, that a knowledge of the Weberian organ is of the greatest importance in the study of herma- phrodism—a study which now requires a fundamental revision in connection with the recent observations on the morphology of the genitals — and especially since the numerous * instances of androgyny for the most part de- pend upon an excessive development of this structure in the male individual,— associate;! with some other abnormal occurrences in the development of the uro-genital canal and the penis, which appear at the same time, accord- ing to the law of coexistence. I have now a number of such atulrogyni before me. They are all goats, in whom this deformity of the genitals is proportionately very frequent. The exterior segments of the genitals (uro-genital sinus and penis) are, in different degrees of development, formed after the female type, i e. they are checked in their development to male parts; and so also is the Weberian organ; while instead of ovaries, testicles with epididymes and seminal ducts are present. In one of these, a new-born animal, the Weberian organ forms a very considerable tubular dependency, which opens by an oval and fissured aperture of about H lines in length, close beneath the two vasa deferentia, in the commencement of the short and wide uro-genital canal. (Fig. 8S2.) From thence the Weberian organ ascends for about two inches as a short and wide cylinder, to split at its extremity into two horns of an inch in length. The left horn is hollow in its whole course, but the right only in its lower half. The * Another smaller number of androgyni includes female individuals, with excessive development of the Wolffian bodies and their efferent ducts (Epi- didymis and vasa deferentia).

Subse- quently to the splitting they run along the Fig. 882.

The testicles have not descended into the scrotum. They lie at the ends of the cornua, the outer coverings of which pass into the sheath of the epididymis. If the vasa defe- rentia (which are somewhat thickened at their lower extremities, and, at about six lines from their apertures, possess a pair of seminal vesicles which lie more deeply), be removed from the Weberian organ, it will be seen that the lower end of the latter (e) is wider in an extent of nine lines than the segment which lies above it, and is distinguished therefrom by a constriction. By a further examination of the interior at this point, 1 find a transverse fold by which the two segments are still more separated from each other. Although this fold is not a complete os tineas, yet it cannot be doubted that the two segments of the Weberian organ, which are limited thereby, are the uterus and vagina; the less so that they possess different developments of the muscular and mucous membranes, which, in appearance and structure, exactly corre- spond with these membranes in the uterus and vagina of a new-born female goat. in a second individual 1 remark a very similar form and development of the Webe- rian organ : excepting that there is a much more considerable size and capacity, which is due to the adult age at which the animal was killed. But here there is no separation into vagina* and uterus. But, in spite of this, by a comparison with the normal female genitals of an individual of the same age, one will easily be convinced, that the Weberian organ in this instance corresponds to the uterus with the vagina, and not to the former of these only. But this may best be seen in a third herma- phrodite now lying before me (Jig. 883.). Here the Weberian organ is so completely separated into uterus and vagina by the development of Fig. 883.

Tab. 22. fig. 3, 4.), and copied by Simpson (loc. cit. p. 300.), exactly resembles this; only the horns of the uterus were here produced for a great length, because the testicles had descended through the inguinal canals into the scrotum. T The presence of real tubes in the so called An- drogyni is very rare, and has perhaps hitherto beei observed with certainty onlv by Mascagni in the bull. (Atti di Siena, vol. v'ii. p. 201.) What are usually thus called are only the longly produced horns of the uterus. All that lies between the body of the uterus and the Himterian ligament belongs, to the comu of the uterus. The tubes always lie, as II. Meckel has pointed out (1. c. S. 43.), on the other side of the Hunterian or round ligament, as is represented in my case by the ligure above. At the end of the tubes in this case, there is a smalt, almost cup-shaped, nodosity at the inner border of the epididymis, which is apparently the imperfectly developed fimbria.VESICULA PROSTATICA. 1427 able width of the vaginal orifice, and the almost female uro-genital canal, that we had a true female before us. The testicles (a a), which remain in the abdominal cavity, possess a true ala vespertilionis, and also exhibit a more solid parenchyma than usual, although they consist of spermatic gland-canals. Only the epididymis and vas deferens are distinctly male in character. The hitter ((/ d) takes the same course as in the instance previously de- scribed, except that the lower ends are com- pletely buried in the anterior wall of the body of the uterus and the vagina (like the Gart- ner's ducts), and the seminal vesicles are much smaller. In this way we acquire a conviction that the Weberian organ, by a further development, is formed — not into a uterus only, nor yet into a vagina only — but, at least as a rule, into both these structures simultaneously. Hence we need not scruple to regard it as the mor- phological equivalent of both. So that, the We- berian organ is the male sinus genitalis, which in the female animal undergoes a further develop, ment into the vagi>ia and the uterus. It is certainly an important guarantee for the correctness of this theory, which had been casually expressed for some time by Bim- baum *, and is now—from a communication to me by letter—shared in by my friend H. Meckel, that it had been applied by E. H. Weberf himself, to the vesicula prostatica of the rabbit. From a comparison with the female organs, he came to the conviction, that it represented the uterus with the vagina ; but unfortunately he neglected to extend this view, and in the other Mammalia he regards the vesicula prostatica as only a masculine uterus. We have mentioned above that the lower part of the Weberian organ is occasionally contrasted with the upper, either by an annular constriction, in man, or by a singular width, as in the horse : or that the contrast may be limited to particular individuals, as in the goat. It is evident that this can only be explained as a transverse severance into uterus and vagina, a condition which cer- tainly is never normally completed in the male animal. And when, as sometimes happens in the horse, the upper section altogether disappears, we need have no scruples in regarding the lower remaining part as the vagina only. J In such instances the theory of Meckel holds good : a theory which was but too widely ap- plied by its founder. Hence it may be laid down as a law, that the upper part of the Weberian organ, which corresponds to the uterus, and which also shows such great variations in the develop- * Besehreibung and Kritik einer eigenthumliche Bildungshemnuuig. Giessen, ISiS, S. 15. t Zusatze, &c, S. 8. j [n some pathological instances a vagina exists without an uterus ; as was detailed by Kicco (Cenno Stor. su di un neutro uomo), and quoted by Simp- son (I. c. p. 703.). ment of its horns, is less persistent than the under part of the vagina. Thus the question may arise whether the Weberian organ, when it is devoid of cornua, still possesses an upper or uterine part. In order to decide tiiis with certainty, every such instance would require a careful analysis, assisted by the liistorv of its normal and abnormal development. But as a rule we are justified in supposing that the Weberian organ is, as was stated above, and as is constantly rendered indubitable by the pre- sence of cornua, both vagina and uterus. I have here, without further discussion, passed over the question, whether a com- plete absence of the vagina may not obtain in the male mammalia ; a supposition which is required by the unconditional reception of Weber's theory. And this has been dona because an assumption of this kind only leads to doubtful morphological hypotheses ; the necessity of which seems very inconceivable after the positive results we have already obtained. Wherever the female individual possesses a vagina the Weberian organ is, at least in part, vagina also; even where, as in the beaver, the exterior appearances speak by no means strongly in its favour. But it is certainly otherwise in the case of those Mammalia whose females lack the vagina. Here 1 do not so much refer to the mono- tremata, who, in the development of their genitals, approach much more closely to the birds than to the other Mammalia, and per- haps are devoid of a proper uterus : but rather to the elephant, in the female of which, as Mayer has lately shown *, the orifice of the urethra is only separated by a very small fold from the external orifice of the uterus, and the vagina is absent. The whole genital canal is here metamorphosed into uterus. In like manner the Weberian organ of the young male certainly corresponds to the uterus solely. In any case, such instances constitute but rare exceptions, and do not affect the general interpretation of the Weberian organ. After all that we have now learnt concern- ing the morphological import of the Weberian organ, it is scarcely necessary to state, that it, —■ or rather the embryonic part out of which it is developed in the male animal,— is present in all mammalia up to a certain period of foetal life. Where it is afterwards absent it must be attributed to a retrograde process of development ; which to some ex- tent appears to occur very early, as in the sheep. The date and degree of this retro- gression is shewn by the anatomical de- velopment of the Weberian organ. In some instances it preserves both its embryonal form and size ; in others it continues to in- crease even after birth, as was especially men- tioned of the rabbit. I recur once more to this animal, because it, with its congeners, is not only conspicuous on account of the described connection be- * Beitrage zur Anatomie der Elephanten ; in den Nov. Act.

Accord- ing to my observations in the embryo of the rabbit, even here the ordinary relation is originally present: the Weberian organ opens close behind the vasa deferentia into the uro- genital canal. But very soon a transverse fold arises behind the points of opening of the seminal ducts, and by its continual enlarge- ment, even after birth, it as constantly pro- trudes these openings outwards into the neck of the Weberian organ. Even in the fully de- veloped condition this fold may be recognised in the anterior swollen margin of the opening of the Webcrian organ. Addendum.—A considerable period having elapsed since the MS. of the preceding article was placed in the Editor's hands, I have availed myself, during that time, of many op- portunities boLh of confirming and extending my observations on the phenomena con- nected with the Weberian corpuscle. My esteemed friend and colleague, the eminent embryologist, (J H. Bischoff, has, with great liberality, handed over to me a large number of rare preparations, from the collection of the Giessen University, for comparative ex- amination. From another source also an important addition to the knowledge of this organ has been afforded us ; and this I hail with the greater pleasure, as it shows how great an interest attaches itself to this subject in other countries. The treatise to which 1 allude is the Inaugural Dissertation by Wahlgren, pub- lished at Lund.* I therefore now find myself in a position to fill up many deficiencies in the foregoing paper. For this purpose I prefer the form of a supplement, and hope that the reader will excuse whatever degree of inconvenience at- taches itself to it, on account of the circum- stances under which a foreign contributor is situated. Quadrumana. — I formerly conjectured that the true Apes, without exception, possessed the Weberian organ (p. 1416.) ; in confirma- tion of this, I can now add, that it occurs both in the species mentioned (,'oc. cit.), and in Pitkecus troglodytes and Cynocephalus por- carius. Wahlgren observed it likewise in an undescribed species of Ape. It appears, how- ever, not to occur throughout the group in an equal manner. In the Lemur albifrons, I ob- served on the colhculus seminalis a fine longi- tudinal fissure, between the apertures of the seminal ducts (a fine capillary canal entered it a short distance — but this may have been * Eidrag till Gencrations-Organernas Anatomi och Physiologi lios Menniskan oc-h Daggdjuren, 1843.

Feree. — Wahlgren describes the Weberian corpuscle in Felis lynx as an oval cavity, three lines in length, and opening by a fissure-hke aperture into the uro-genital canal on the mid- die of the verumontanum. In the Brown Bear it is similar, but much larger (5'"), pear- shaped, and with a considerable aperture. Nasua fusca, also, according to Wahlgren, possesses a similar gland. In the Otter, I have now observed this organ in two speci- mens. It is disposed as the foregoing, and; as was conjectured, has a considerable central cavity, with a small aperture. The cornua are solid ligamentous cords. Marsupialia.— The marsupial animals ap- pear to be very generally destitute of this organ. In Halrnaturusgiganteus, Phascolomys wombatus, and Sarcophilus ursinus, I found no more traces of it than previously in Didelphys pirginiana. Wahlgren also found it absent in Halrnaturus giganteus. Rodcntia. — The remarkable structure of this organ in Rabbits and Hares might well belong to the whole group of the Lepurince. In Lepusborealis it is the least, asterisparibus, according to Wahlgren. Yet here it attains even the colossal size of three inches, with a proportionate breadth (up to \" 10"'). With the Palmipedia, on the contrary, it is other- wise. Distinct as it is in the Beaver (p. 1418.), it is but little developed in the nearly related 3fyopotanuis coypus,'m which Wahlgren found a mere rudiment, consisting of two thread-like cords. The two agreed in their position with the Weberian corpuscle of the beaver, and enclose a small cavity, with an opening on the colliculus seminalis. With re- gard to Sciurus, Wahlgren confirmed the ab- sence of the organ : nor was it observed in Lemnus. Hystrix eristata anil Hydroehcerus enpybara are likewise without it, according to my own observations. In the last, however, as in the closely allied Agouti and Cavia, the two seminal ducts have a common, cavernous, wide aperture. Edentata. — Besides the Bradypits iridac- tylus, I have lately examined Cholcep>us didac- tylu1', also Dasypus octosus, and Ornithorhyncus paradoxus. In none of these is the organ present. Wahlgren also states the same of Ornithorhyncus. Ruminantia.— The Weberian organ appears to be generally present in the Cervina. That of the deer is above described (p. 1420.). It is far moreconsiderable in the Hart and the Reindeer, where it ascends between the seminal ducts in the fcrm of a cylinder, about two inches long, which in the former is distinctly bi-cleft at the extremity. There is an internal cavity, which in the Hart is continued into the cornua, and opens on the vcmniontanum. In the Goat there are numerous individual varieties in the development of this organ, as I have before mentioned (p. 1420.). In many instances it is altogether wanting, as I have now convinced myself. In one case I1129 VESICULiE SEMINALES. 4 y 3 saw it in the form of a single longish body (3"'), between thevasa deferential in another it continued upwards as a long solid cord, which adhered by its bifurcate extremity to the seminal ducts. In both cases it had a distinct opening. The wide differences in the development of the organ above mentioned, are of rare occurrence. As regards the Sheep, the absence of the Weberian corpuscle in the perfect form has been already stated. According to Wahlgren, however, such is the case (as in the Goat) in isolated individuals only; whilst in others, on the contrary, a small purse-shaped body repre- sents this organ. Wahlgren describes this organ as occurring in the Bullock in the form of a flask-shaped sac, 6-7"' long. That here also many va- rieties occur (as pointed out by my observa- tions), is evident, for in another (castrated) animal it was present as a short uniform canal. Cetacea.—In a young specimen of Delpkinus delphis (so labelled), I now find, as already stated in regard to other species, two thick, cleft - sliaped, closely approximate pseudo-repre- sentations of tins organ. The examination of the Halicore dugong was of particular interest to me. Tin's animal, belonging to the group of herbivorous whales, possesses a Weberian organ, having a small roundish (and bordered) opening on the colliculus seminalis. Its form and size cannot be accurately determined on account of the condition of the preparation; it appears, however, to be about an inch in length, and in shape like a wide longish bottle. A peculiar structure here distinguishes the commencing portion of the uro-genital canal. Instead of exhibiting a direct continuation of the urethra, it begins with a peculiarly wide cavity, which is bent outwards like the belly of a retort, and receives the urethra (under wh'ch the large colliculus seminalis rises pro- minent!}') on its hinder wall. I know of only one male mammal that presents a similar structure, viz. the Hedgehog ; nor in this case is the disposition of parts so remarkable. When, therefore, Wahlgren asserts that this cavity at the commencement of the uro-genital canal in the Hedgehog is the Weberian organ, he is in error ; as is proved by the co-exist- ence of both of these peculiarities of struc- ture in the Dugong. In reference to the moi-phological significa- tion of the organ in question, Wahlgren com- pletely agrees with me. He also views it as the representation of the whole female sinus, that is, the uterus and vagina taken together.* We must not forget that, as we have already observed, the latter of these two parts finds * Still more recently, on the contrary, Van Deen affirms (Zeitschrift fur wissenschaftl. Zoologie v. Siebofd und Kfflliker, 1849, S.2G8.), also Betz (Mid- ler's Archiv, 1850, S. 65.), that the Weberian organ is exclusively the "uterus masculinus." We do not here again enter into a critique of this view, and must refer our readers to our'former remarks. ~\Ye must mention, however, that the first of these arti- cles contains very numerous errors, and many odd hypotheses, a complete and general representation in this organ. This especially applies to the simple form of this organ, when it occurs as a mere oval body without upward continuations of the cornua ; and among others, to the human utriculus, which, on that account, in the case of an abnormal enlargement, becomes merely a vagina. Steglehner lias already remarked* on this subject, that the so-called uterus cys- todes of Ackermaun's well-known hermaj ln o- dite case (Art. Hkrmapuroditism, Vol. I!, p. 709.), answered, not to the uterus, but the vagina. I have been led to the same results by the examination of a great number of human hypospadiacs and hermaphrodites. A true uterus, as in the single case of Mayer-f-, is indeed only seldom found on such a va- gina. The vasa deferentia pass constantly on the anterior wall of this vagina, and open near it in the uro-genital canal, like Gart- ner's canals in the Ruminantia. They are never connected with the vagina itself, as Hyrtl has observed. (Rud, Leuckart.) VESICULA SEMINALES. — These are a pair of sacculated organs, peculiar to the male, situated behind the bladder, be- tween it and the rectum. In man they ap- pear, externally, as multilocular cysts about two inches in length and three quarters of an inch in their greatest breadth. Their shape is fusiform; their larger ends diverging from one another, and their smaller ends con- verging so as almost to meet. These smaller ends are surrounded by the prostate, and are directed slantingly forwards, as well as down- wards and inwards. Along their inner sides pass the vasa deferentia, with which they join, by a narrow outlet, at the base of the prostate. The vesicula? are invested by a fascia de- rived from the prostate, which can be removed by careful dissection, ami then they are found to consist of a blind tube of about the calibre of a small goose quill doubled upon itself again and again, all the gyrations being held together by cellular tissue, so as to give the appearance of fusiform multilocular sacs. A little careful maceration will enable the anatomist to unravel these gyrations, when each vesicula will sometimes be found to be one simple ccecal tube about six or eight inches long, or, more frequently, there will be three or four cascal diverticular appendages to the main tube, in which case the greatest length (that of the central main tube) will be very much less. This tube has a very much smaller calibre for a short distance from its junction with the vas deferens than else- where. The narrow portion is straight, and is commonly called the duct of the vesiculce seminales. These vesicles are found to contain a synovia-like brownish mucus, the nature of * De Hermaphroditorum Xatura. Bamberga;, 1817, p. 07. | Vol. II. Art. Hermaphroditism, fig. 303.1430 VESICUL,E SEMINALES. which we shall have to inquire into presently, when we treat of their function. The fascia that invests the mass of gyra- tions, like a fusiform bag, contains a great proportion of involuntary muscular fibre, and there is also a large admixture of involuntary fibre in the proper parietes of the tube. It is, of course, lined throughout with a mucous surface, which has a faint reticular marking, like that of the stomach in some animals, and is evidently glandular, or secreting. Comparative Anatomy.— Some consider able difficulty has been experienced by com- parative anatomists in identifying the vesiculte seminales in different animals. This has given rise to much discrepancy as to their existence, or non-existence, in certain species. In the Ruminantia, for instance, the prostate assumes the very singular form of two organs, each having a large central cavity opening into the urethra by a single duct; and these organs, very naturally, have been regarded by some as vesicular seminales. Who, indeed, can undertake to say, with certainty, that they are not? It is far from improbable that they are both the one and the other — pros- tate and vesicula at once. There are two very distinct kinds of com- parative anatomical identity—functional iden- tity and homological identity. Instances are very numerous of homologically identical parts being very diverse in function ; the function of the (homological) hand, for instance, is to seize with in man, to walk with in the horse, to fly with in the bat, and to swim with in the whale. And there are not, wanting many in- stances of parts functionally identical, and homologically diverse; a striking instance of which is furnished by the urinary bladder in Mammalia, compared with the reservoir of urine sometimes met with in Ovipara. In the case now before us, the function is in question, and the homology by no means prononce ; no wonder then that identification should be difficult and uncertain. We pro- ceed, however, to notice the various forms of certain sacs met with in brute animals, posited in close relation to the vasa defe- rentia, and impressing one somehow, perhaps homologically, with a notion that they are identical with the human vesicular seminales. Such vesicular are exclusively confined to the placental division of the Mammalia, They are not met with in the JMarsupialia nor Monotremata, nor in the other vertebrate classes, — Aves, Reptilia, nor Pisces. In some of these, Aves for instance, there are undoubted reservoirs of semen, formed by di- latations of the vasa deferentia ; these, how- ever, are manifestly not the organs in question. Reservoirs of semen are also met with in some InveHebrula, but since, as I have else- where noticed (Art. Symmetry, Vol. IV., p. 850.), homological identity of parts can in no instance be established in animals belonging to different sub-kingdoms, the only identity being in all cases merely that of function, these have no title to be described in an article on the vesiculae seminales, from which by function they are, as will be seen here- after, for certain diverse. They are indubitably present in all the Quadrumana, the Cheiroptera, and the Insccti- vora. They are wanting in the Carnivora. Present in the Rodcntia, and Pachydermata, and in the Manatee. In the other Cetacca they are absent. In the Ruminantia, the ques- tionable organs, mentioned above as hollow prostates, occur. In the higher Quadrumana they much re- semble those of man ; and their ducts join the vasa deferentia much in the same manner as in the human subject. In most of the lower monkeys they have not the convoluted form, but occur as simple sacs, and the outlets, at the side of the verumontanum, alone are common to their ducts and the vasa deferentia. In Galeopithccus they are remarkably small. In the hedgehog their size is enormous — twice that of the vesiculae in man—and they have a very interesting form. They consist each of a small central duct, from which ramify very numerous convoluted caeca of much greater calibre. The central duct terminates on the verumontanum, near the vas deferens. In the Rodcntia they are, mostly, very large. In the rabbit and hare they are, apparently, fused together, and form a single mesial sac, the upper end of which is somewhat square, thick and glandular. This sac opens by a mesial orifice, which receives the vasa defe- rentia, upon the verumontanum, It is, how- ever, very improbable that this really (homo- logically) represents the vesiculae seminales ; its mesial position, between the vasa deferentia, is essentially different from that of the vesiculae, which is always external to those ducts. It is most probably the utriculus prostaticus. In the other Rodents they are double ;—long, simple, and bi-fusiform in the guinea pig; serrated in the rat; having small ramifications in the agouti; and convoluted in the beaver. In the squirrel they consist of a small tube with glandular parietes, and much convoluted. In the Alpine marmot they are but slightly developed, very convoluted, and have glandular parietes. In all these their outlets are quite distinct from, though near to, those of the vasa deferentia. In the Pachydermata they assume very various forms. In the genus Equus they re- semble two small urinary bladders, and have two distinct muscular coats. They are thicker at their fundus than elsewhere; the thickening consisting of a glandular substance. The orifice of their ducts is in common with those of the vasa deferentia. There is also, in this genus, a third vesicular organ, situated me- sially between the vasa deferentia, of a long cylindical form, with a rounded fundus, and secreting a substance of the consistence and colour of honey. This is, undoubtedly, the ho- mologue of the utriculus prostaticus. In the Hyrax they are very large and convoluted. In the Rhinoceros they consist of two large irre- gular sacs, whose excretory ducts join the vasa deferentia. They are very large in the elephant, of an oval figure, with a constriction at their upper end. Their internal surface is divided by1431 VESICULyE SEMINALES. irregular columns and grooves, more marked in their upper part, and deficient at the lower. On their outer anil anterior aspect is a pe- culiar muscle, arising from their neck and .middle portion, and spreading out over their upper part, which can contract their cavity and expel their contents. Their ducts join the vasa deferentia beneath their ampullated portion noticed below. In the boar they each consist of a great number of lobes and lobules arranged around, and communicating with, a small central canal, which opens on the veru- montanmn, near the vas deferens. It may not be out of place here to mention several remarkable peculiarities in the structure of the vasa deferentia, when they arrive at the back of the bladder, in several animals. In man this part of them is dilated anil sinuous, and generally contains a fluid very similar to that found in the vesicuke. In the horse this part of the ducts is extremely thickened by the occurrence of numerous glandular cellules in its walls. These cellules contain a thick mucus. Much the same condition is met with in the bull. In the elephant each vas deferens, when it arrives at this part, enlarges into a very large cavity, which it is evident may readily, and no doubt does really, fulfil the function indicated by the words vesiculaa seminales. Function. — With regard to the function of these organs, I am able to come to little more than a confimation of the negative con- clusion of Hunter, that they are not reservoirs of semen. Hunter's positive conclusion that they form part of the generative apparatus, is pretty clearly proved. I proceed to offer the evi- dence from which these two conclusions are arrived at. 1st. They arc not reservoirs of semen. That they were receptacles into which the semen might regurgitate and be stored up ready for emission, was doubtless suggested by their con- nection with the vasa deferentia in the human subject, so like the relation of the gall bladder to the hepatic duct. A very obvious objection to this is that, as we have seen, the same relation does not occur in the majority of animals ; but the difficulty of proving the identity of the sacs called vesiculae in other animals, diminishes very much the force of this ob- jection ; and even if a homological identity were proved, still numerous caveats warn us not therefrom to infer their functional identity. It is moreover extremely easy to conceive the possibility of the regurgitation of semen into the vesiculae, where the two ducts have an out- let, though merely an outlet, in common. ( In such cases they join just in the act, so to speak, of debouching.) And it is far from impossible to conceive the regurgitation of semen even when the outlets are distinct, especially in some instances. In the guinea- pig, for example, the outlets of the vasa defe- rentia, vesiculae seminales, and prostatic ducts, are surrounded by—occur in the bottom of—- a little spout, of about a line in diameter, which projects about half a line into the ure- thra, slanting towards the outlet. Another objection to their being reservoirs of semen is that the fluid found in them is extremely different from that found in the vasa de- ferentia, as observed by Hunter, in colour, consistence, and smell ; but that they should secrete a mucus of their own, is only pa- rallel with what we know to be the case in the gall bladder; and that admixture with this mucus should considerably alter the character of the semen, is extremely pro- bable. To a microscopic examination of the contents of the vesicula1, we naturally look for a solution of this question, now that we know the extremely characteristic microscopic appearance of semen —Are spermatozoa found in it? Miiller says " That the vesiculae seminales are really receptacles of semen, is beyond a doubt, since spermatic animalcules have been discovered in their contents in the human subject after death." * To the fact, that spermatozoa are occasionally found in the contents of the vesiculae, I can add my testimony ; but I am compelled by other facts to dissent from the conclusion at which Miiller arrives. To infer that the proper function of the vesiculae is to serve as re- servoirs of semen, because spermatozoa " have been" found in them after death, is a noil sequitur. Spermatozoa may often be found in the urethra, and I have found them in the .urinary bladder. These restless little entities often wriggle themselves into organs where their presence is far from usual or normal. Even after death they may be forced into the the vesiculae by the violence unavoidable in removing the parts for examination. The question is, are they usually found in the contents ot the vesiculae, and that in large numbers? To answer this question I thank- fully avail myself of the more extensive obser- vations of my friend, Mr. J. Quekett, who carefully examined the subject some years ago. He tells me that the presence of sper- matozoa in the human vesicuioe is not very frequent, even when the sacs are very dis- tended by their contents ; and that when they are present, it is in sparing numbers — in fact, as a few stray ones. This accords per- fectly with the results of my own researches. When I find the vesiculae seminales full to distension with a mucous fluid, and discover, by a microscopic examination, only a few solitary spermatozoa in it, and when I compare this with the crowds of spermatozoa seen in the fluid squeezed from the vas deferens, I cannot believe, even allowing a reasonably broad margin for dilution with mucus, that 1 am ex- amining stored semen. In the lower animals I have never observed a single spermatozoon in the contents of their vesiculae seminales, although I have carefully examined it taken from individuals that had been purposely sub- jected to prolonged sexual excitement un- gratified. My observations, however, have been entirely confined to those brute animals the ducts of whose vesiculae do not join the vasa * Physiology.

The best evidence that com- parative anatomy affords on the subject is, that, in the elephant, vesicula? seminales, join- ing the vas deferens just as in man, coexist with unmistakeable seminal reservoirs. If the vesicula; were merely receptacles of semen their presence here would be quite superero- gatory, and contrary to Nature's usual fashion. It adds to the signification of this fact, that the junction of the ducts occurs below the enormous ampulla, that is, between it and the urethra ; so that the ampulla must be filled before any semen could be regurgitated into the vesicula?. Still, as .spermatozoa are occasionally found in the human vesicula? seminales, microscopic evidence, of itself, is not able to give us that complete negation of the old and widely spread view of the functions of the vesicula; which I have ventured upon above. And here the acute observations, unaided by the microscope, of the immortal Hunter, of themselves suf- ficient to prove this negation almost to a certainty, afford such an accession of proof as cannot fail to be convincing. He examined the vesicula? in several subjects in which one testicle had been extirpated a long time before death, and he found in every case that the vesicula of the castrated side ivas as full as that of the other. One of the cases examined by him was a married man in whom he had ex- tirpated the left testicle a year before his death. " On examining the body, the vesicula? were both found nearly full, more especially that on the left side, which might have been acci- dental." To remark that the vesicula of the castrated side was fuller than the other seems to be proving too much (he observed the same in one other case) ; but the rest of his cases show clearly that this was, as he says, accidental. These invaluable observations of Hunter, together with Ins comparison of the thick brownish mucus found in the vesicula?, with the extremely different, milky, slightly viscid semen in the v,as deferens of the same subject, and the contrast observable in the two fluids by aid of the microscope, — a few scattered spermatozoa or none at all in the one, crowded myriads in the other, —' lead irresistibly to the conclusion that the vesiculae seminales are not reservoirs of semen. 2dly, They form part of the generative ap- paratus. This is pretty clearly \ proved by Hunter, by observations made on those animals that have periods of rut or sexual excitement alternating with periods of sexual quiescence or impotency, such as tiie stag, the mole, and the land-mouse. In these animals the vesiculae seminales, in common with the testicles, pro- state gland, &c., are exceedingly small during the period of impotence, and enlarge enor- mously and rapidly for the season of rut. In the mole they are hardly discernible in winter, but become enormously large in spring. Conclusive, however, as this proof appears, prima facie, to be, it is somewhat weakened by the fact that much the same thing happens, in various animals, to other parts which would scarcely be enumerated as belonging to the generative apparatus, such as the horns of the stag, the comb of the cock, &c. Yet, adding to the fact of this periodic enlargement and diminu- tion the anatomical position and connections of the vesicula?, together with their absence in the female, there is constituted a very satisfactory proof that they form part of the male generative apparatus. These conclusions, however, merely bring us two steps nearer to a definite knowledge of the exact office fulfilled by the organs in ques- tion. I now proceed to adduce such other ob- servations as I have been able to make, or have found upon record, as may aid in forming an hypothesis as to their positive function, or may appear interesting. The mucus found in the vesicula? is, as will readily be admitted from what has been said above, undoubtedly secreted by their glandular parietes. This is still better proved by a case of Hunter's, where, as a congenital defect, they had no outlet (nor inlet), and yet were full of mucus. This case shows also that they have the power of re-absorbing their secretion, or at least renders it highly probable. A mucus in all respects similar is usually found in the part of the vas deferens imme- diately contiguous to the junction of the duct of the vesicula?. This is very probably se- creted by the walls of this part of the vas — in the horse there is no doubt of it. The mu- cus of the vesicula? is very thick and viscid in all animals, but more so in some than in others. I have examined it carefully in the guinea- pig, in which animal it is remarkably thick ; but there is a difference, in this respect, be- tween that which is near the outlet and that which is at the fundus, it being thickest in the former position and gradually thinner towards the latter. It is transparent, granular, and has a faint opaline blue colour. I found that it rapidly solidified upon being squeezed out of the vesiculae, and that too even when not exposed to the air and when not subjected to any remarkable diminution of temperature, when lying, in fact, in the urethra of the animal just killed. The mucus contained in the vesiculae also solidified more though slowly — that in the fundus most slowly, and the rest in gradual progression up to that near the outlet. In opening the abdomen of a guinea- pig, it is almost impossible to avoid com- pressing the vesicula?, and probably from this cause a considerable quantity of the mucus is forced into the urethra, where I always found it forming a solid mass as hard and elastic as the cartilage of a ray-fish, and moulded to the shape of the urethra : this within a few minutes after the death of the animal. Now, this is just the contrary to what, according to Hunter, is the case with emitted semen, which becomes more and more fluid under exposure. I was, however, highly interested to observe that if the vasa deferentia and vesicula? be compressed at the1433 VESICUL2E SEMINALES. same moment, so that the mucus and semen shall mix in the act of escaping into the urethra, and they do mix in a remarkably per- fect manner in the little spout-like verumon- tanum of the guinea-pig, then the immediate solidification of the mucus dots not occur. Whether this curious effect of their mixing is clue to the mechanical whipping of the sperma- tozoa or to a specific solvent power for mucus in the semen, must remain undetermined at present. The degree of liquefaction produced seems to be much greater than what would be due to simple admixture, that is to say, it is much greater than would he produced by adding a drop of water equally small to a mass of gum, for instance, equally thick and equally large. This throws fresh light on some observations of Hunter's, made upon guinea-pigs. He killed a male (which, by the way, he had castrated on one side six months before), immediately after it had copulated, and he found the vesiculae of both sides full. He also killed a female immediately after she had received the male and "examined with atten- tion what was contained in the vagina anil uterus; in neither," he remarks, "could I find any of the mucus of the vesiculae, which from its firmness must have been easily de- tected." He regards these facts as proof that the contents of the vesicuke are not emitted in copulation ; but that part of the p.-oof based on the non-detection of thick mucus in the vagina and uterus is, of course, much weakened by the fact of the liquefying property of the semen. The other part of his proof, derived from the fullness of the vesiculae immediately after coitus, is, perhaps, answered by the following observations. The vesicuke are never found empty—except when they are diminished during the periodic rut in certain animals — in fact they seem to all appearance equally full at all times, but here no doubt appearances are dec< itful ; they contract and expand according to the volume of their contents, so that they are never flaccid, and always appear to be as lull as they can be. I have observed them exceedingly full and large in an animal just killed, and have watched them contracting under the stimulus of exposure to cold air, and when nearly the whole of their contents have been expelled by the contraction, they have still appeared to be quite full, —I should have considered them to be so if I had not actually seen them expel their contents. It is evident that the whole contents of the vesiculae are not emitted in one copulation, but there is strong reason to believe that a part is. The semen which can be squeezed from the vas deferens is milk white and has very little if any viscosity. Now Hunter de- scribing emitted semen says, " the semen first discharged from the living body is of a bluish white colour, in consistence like cream, and similar to what is found in the vasa deferentia after death ('?); while that which follows is somewhat like the common mucus of the nose but less viscid. The semen becomes more fluid upon exposure to the air, particu- larly that first thrown out." Here then is a mucus, which very probably is from the vesiculae. 1 am convinced that it does not exist in the semen of the vas deferens. The mucus of the vesiculae, examined in the guinea-pig, is not soluble in water. The urine of the animal seems to solidify it in an extreme degree, for if a little of it gets into the urinary bladder it becomes as hard as spermaceti. Boiled in water it shrivels up slightly, but is not in the least degree dis- solved. I dissolved it by repeated boiling in solution of potash, by which means I pro- cured a perfectly limpid, colourless solution. This yielded no precipitate on the addition of acetic acid. In neither of these respects, therefore, does it differ much from the ordi- nary varieties of mucus. (See Art. Mucus, Vol. 111. p. -182 ) Submitted to microscopic examination, I have found it to consist of a very sparing quantity of fluid, in which are suspended iittle conglomerated masses of trans- paient solid, just visible by the naked eye. The majority of these are of a pretty uniform volume, and appear, when magnified fifty dia- meters, about tlie size of duck shot; there are, however, much larger ones and much smaller. Their general contour, whether they be large or small, is spherical, and they have a nodulated, mulberry-like surface, as if composed of smaller bails. The smaller component balls have also an irregular, granular surface, and neither they nor the large conglomerate spheres show any distinct trace of being enclosed in a cell-mem- brane. 1 have, however, sometimes obseived numerous nucleated cells in a portion taken from the fundus of the organ. But often I have sought for these in vain. I have never found them when the vesiculae have been ex- ceedingly full and distended, in which circum- stances, most probably, secretion would be arrested, and perhaps even absorption going on. These cells are about the size of the smaller (component) spheres. I am tempted by these observations to conclude that the cells I met with were the secreting epithelia of the vesiculae, and that becoming filled with inspissated mucus (r1) they conglomerate them- selves into larger spheres. 1 found it con- venient in making these examinations some- times to add a little white of egg, which pro- duces no alteration in the appearances be\ond a greater isolation of the spheres. When water is added, the outlines of the spheres become much more distinct, showing a greater diflerence of refraction of light, and there be- come percept.ble very numerous insoluble globules, which have a great tendency to coalesce, and appear very much like oil ; their refractive power is, however, less, and there are other reasons for doubting that they are really globules of oil. When semen is mixed with ibis secretion of the vesiculae, the spheres are still visible, and the spermatozoa are seen disporting in the fluid between them. No solution of them is clearly detectable. This, however, it should be observed, is when the mixture is exposed to cold, &c. in examination;1434 VESICULiE seminales. it miglit be different when it is lodged in the uterus or vagina of the female. For reasons given hereafter, I am led to believe that the quantity of actual semen from the testicles emitted at each copulation, is most probably very small, perhaps only three or four drops, at all events not more than the vas deferens is capable of containing. Such an extremely small quantity would be lost in the capacious canal of the urethra, or still more in the enormously capacious canal of the vagina, in the uterus, and in the Fallo- pian tubes. Some dilution, some addition to the volume, seems necessary in order to obtain an efficient injection of the life-giving fluid. And the quantity actually emitted by a man amounts, by all accounts, to two or three drachms. There has been an ad- dition somewhere. The prostate has doubt- less contributed its share, the tiny glands of Cowper theirs, the urethra has given its mite of mucus, more mucus is awaiting in the va- gina, and 1 believe that the vesiculae are not behind in adding a portion of their hoard of ready-formed mucus to the general stock. The spermatozoa huddled and crowded in countless millions in the vas deferens are now able to disport themselves at ease in the con- genial medium ; and the number contained in a few drops of pure semen would be sufficient to people abundantly several drachms of fluid. 1 am induced by these considerations to form the hypothesis that the office of the vesiculae is to secrete, and keep in store, a mucus of such a nature as is congenial to spermatozoa ; which answers the simple purpose of diluting the semen secreted in sparing quantities by the testicles. By di- luting I mean merely increasing the volume, not liquefying; for ihe mixed fluid is more viscid than pure semen. This hypothesis I would, however, have regarded as only pro- visional until more satisfactory evidence is obtained. It is the only one which the facts at present known warrant. One is much inclined to doubt that so singular an organ as the vesiculae is devoted to so simple a pur- pose. The prostate is generally believed to perform an exactly similar office ; and one is still more loth to believe that two organs so different in appearance as the prostate and vesicular have an identical function. But as I have advanced this hypothesis I proceed to defend it on these and other points. That organs, having the air of being very important, are sometimes engaged in per- forming a very simple and subordinate func- tion, is instanced by the salivary glands, which afford also an example of several distinct organs fulfilling exactly the same purpose : — the parotid, the submaxillary, the sublingual, and the numerous little buccal glands, all engaged in secreting a moistening and diluting fluid, which is not indispensably necessary. All these salivary glands are, however, very much alike in appearance and structure, whilst the vesiculae seminales do not in any way resemble the prostate. In reference to the human subject this remark is true, but not as regards many brute animals. In the guinea-pig the prostate is composed of nu- merous ramified caeca, but loosely bound together, and not very small in calibre, and the vesiculae really appear as though they were merely a couple of the prostatic caeca gigantically develo; ed. The secretion of these prostatic cceca is also exactly similar to that of the vesiculae. Objections to the iden- tity of the functions of two organs, based on the difference of their appearance, are completely answered by observing the enor- mous difference of appearance of the liver, for example, in vertebrata, compared with the liver of a crab or lobster ; or, what is more similar to the case under consideration, the large and remarkable gland that secretes the egg-shell in the ray-fish, compared with the part which secretes the egg-shell in birds, which is nothing more than just a peculiar villosity of one portion of the oviduct. It is not now my task to enquire into the function of the prostate, I am merely combatting an objection that may be raised to the hypothesis which I am advocating. The question very naturally suggests itself, how is it that the vesiculae are absent in several animals of the mammalian class ? In birds and reptiles there is no urethra, no vagina, no uterus for the semen to be lost in : the orifices of the vasa deferentia are brought into immediate apposition with those of the oviducts in the act of copulation ; but in the carnivora, where the vesiculae are indubitably absent, the semen has to find its way, meandering through all those labyrinths; and in the kangaroo, the wombat, &c, the males of which have no vesiculae, the vaginae of the females are remarkably Ion;;, double, and sin- gularly crooked (see Vol. III., fig. 138,). The answer to this is, the males of these animals possess a great number of glands (loc. cit. figs. 13.5, 13o'. and Vol. IV. fig. 875.), pouring their secretion into the urethra, which secretion, not improbably, serves the same purpose of dilution. W ith respect to the difference of the con- tents of the vesiculae in different animals, so obvious, for instance, in respect of their con- sistence or viscosit}', it should be remembered that we have evidence of a specific relation between the spermatozoa of a given species and the medium in which they are destined to float after their exit from the spermatic ap- paratus. I allude to the fact noticed in the article Semen (Vol. IV. p. 504-.), that the spermatozoa of a marine non-copulating species continue their movements in sea water, but become instantly motionless and dead when treated with fresh water, which has no inju- rious effect on the spermatozoa of freshwater species. This may, perhaps, also throw light upon the function of other accessory seminal glands. Every copulating species is probably able to supply, from one or several glands, a medium congenial to its own spermatozoa. There is then no special reservoir for semen in the human subject, nor in the great ma- jority of mammalian animals. What then1433 VESICUL/E SEMINALES. becomes of the secretion of the testicles when it is not used ? Another question also requires to be answered. The semen, as will be seen by referring to Art. Semen, seems to be a highly elaborated secretion. There is none amongst the various secretions of the body that seems to require so much time for its elaboration. Not only have cells to be formed and thrown off, as in the case of other secretions, but, after they are liberated in the tubules of the testis, nuclei have to divide, nucleoli to multiply, and each division of the nucleoli to become, through a gradual adoles- cence, an adult spermatozoon. This surely requires time ; how can such a fluid be im- provised at any moment when copulation may take place ? To the first of these questions I would answer, the testicles do not go on continually secreting, but stop when there is no occasion for their action; as I have convinced myself by observing, that the vas deferens is gene- rally found empty in men who have been long removed from the society of women. Hunter arrives at the conclusion, that the vas deferens and testicles can and do reabsorb the unused semen, and that conclusion it is im- possible to avoid, because there are many instances on record of the vasa deferentia being imperforate in a subject whose testicles were in full functional activity. But involun- tary emissions in sleep are most probably the usual and natural means whereby the burden of unappropriated secretion is got rid of. The answer to the second question is as follows. There is strong reason to believe that man, in common with brutes, is subject to a periodic rut, an alternation of sexual excitement and quiescence, occurring at short intervals. During the period of excitement spermatozoa are becoming rapidly adult, the testicles and their ducts are full of semen, the individual is in the condition of a fish with a full milt, or a bird or stag with enlarged tes- ticles. He now instintively seeks the society of women (these things are not so much mat- ters of chance as is generally imagined, and the testicles may be blameable for much of what is usually ascribed to the heart). Lascivious dalliance increases his excitement, and all is ready for the copulative act. There is reason to believe that one vas deferens alone furnishes the semen for one copulation, the other vas supplies another emission ; but after a few encounters, some of them perhaps without effect, a period of rest is required to secrete and perfect a fresh store of semen. The duct of the testicle is the only reservoir, and for that reason, combined with the unlikeli- hood of the impromptu secretion of semen, I formed the opinion cited above, that the quantity of actual secretion of the testicles emitted in one copulation is probably so small as to require augmentation by some congenial fluid. Hunter remarks,— " We have a presump- tive proof that the semen can be absorbed in the body of the testicle and in the epididydi- mis, and that the vesiculas secrete a mucus which they are capable of absorbing when it cannot be made use of. We may likewise infer from what has been said, that the se- men is not retained in reservoirs after it is secreted, and kept there till it is used, but that it is secreted at the time, in consequence of certain affections of the mind stimulating the testicles to this action ; for we find that if lascivious ideas are excited in the mind, and the paroxysm is afterwards prevented from coming on, the testicles become pain- ful and swelled, from, we may suppose, the quantity of semen secreted, and the in- creased action of the vessels, which pain and swelling is removed immediately upon the paroxysm being brought on and the semen evacuated ; but, if that does not take place, the action of the vessels will still be kept up, and the pain in the testicles in general conti- nue till the paroxysm and evacuation of the semen is brought on, to render the act com- plete; without which a stop cannot be so quickly put to the action of the vessels that produce the secretion, nor the parts be al- lowed so easily to resume their natural state. There is at this time no sensation of any kind felt in the seat of the vesiculae seminales, which shows that the action is in the testicles, and in them alone. The pain in the testicles, in consequence of being filled with semen and,' of the action being incomplete, is sometimes so considerable as to make it necessary to produce an evacuation of the semen to relieve the patient." Hunter was not aware of the highly elaborated character of the seminal fluid, or he would probably not have so readily accepted the idea of the semen being secreted " at the time." The " lascivious ideas which he mentions are probably an effect or conco- mitant of seminal repletion rather than a cause, yet becoming, perhaps, an additional cause in their turn. Many interesting arguments in relation to this subject might doubtless be derived from the manner of copulation of different animals; but this is an occurrence in the natural history of species which authors have entirely left unnoticed, probably from feelings of delicacy. This want is felt as a great desideratum by the comparative anato- mist, in investigating any of the accessory parts of generation, where the manner of coition unavoidably forces itself upon our consideration, malgie the delicacy, which everybody feels, but which the physiologist is bound to suppress when he handles such sub- jects. As a sample of such arguments I may adduce the following. The prolonged coition of the dog, which is destitute of vesiculae, was formerly much dwelt upon in support of the pre-Hunterian view of tne receptacle-function of these sacs. But is the act prolonged in every animal destitute of vesiculae ? 1 have been told that the copulation of cats is very quickly completed ; and cats are as destitute of vesiculae as dogs. On the other hand, the boar is very long in coition, although his vesi- culae are very large and complicated. Such reasonings on the facts of comparative anatomy1436 VISION. are, indeed, very unsafe, unless the number of facts observed is very great, and that is not the present condition of our knowledge of the copulative act. For that reason I have not dwelt upon this, prima facie so obvious, line of argument. Our knowledge of the function of the ve- sicular seminales is, therefore, nearly in the same condition as it was left by the great Hunter, whose concise paper on this subject is a master piece of reasoning and scientific acumen. I have been able to add to this, be- sides confirmation, little more than some few observations tending to render it more pro- bable that the secretion of the vesiculae is used in copulation. I have, further, ventured on an hypothesis which, 1 suppose, has suggested itself to many before, and with which I am by no means satisfied. So great, however, are the difficulties surrounding the subject, that in this unsatisfactory state — the positive func- tion still hypothetical—I am compelled re- luctantly to leave it. (5. B. Pittard.) VISION. — ( Fr. vision, from Latin visio, from video, visas, sight.)—The faculty of seeing is one of the chief means by which living creatures are brought into relation with the world around, and is the especial means by which they are enabled to appreciate the wonderful pheno- mena which flow directly and indirectly from the creation of light. When in obedience to the Divine command, " There was light," there were organs created for its perception ; and it is interesting to observe that the re- storation of this gift of perception, when lost, was among the most frequent, and certainly not the least striking of the manifestations of miraculous power displayed by the Saviour of mankind. The vastness of the field over which the faculty of vision gives us command, the precision and permanence of this class of our percep ions, the variety and accuracy of the information it conveys, and the delight it affords, lead us irresistibly to regard it as the most perfect of our senses. In the in- vestigation of this subject a train of minute adaptation and wonderful contrivance is dis- closed to us, in which are combined the ex- tremes of grandeur and of delicacy. There is no department of science that possesses a more absorbing interest than the laws of optics when applied to the eye, and certainly none which points with a steadier hand to the wisdom of an omnipotent Creator. Very curious and unexpected information respecting the early condition of the surface of this planet and the ancient atmosphere has been afforded by an investigation into the structure of the organs of vision with which the earliest marine animals were supplied. In the eloquent language of Dr. Buckland, " with respect to the waters wherein the Trilobites maintained their existence throughout the entire period of the transition formation, we conclude that there could not have been that imaginary tur- bid and chaotic fluid, from the precipitate of which some geologists have supposed the ma- terials of the surface of the earth to be de- rived : because the structure of the eyes of these animals is such, that any kind of fluid in w hich they could" have been submerged at the bottom must have been pure and trans- parent enough to allow the passage of light to organs of vision, the nature of which is so fully disclosed by the state of perfection in which they are preserved. With regard to the atmosphere also, we may infer that had it differed materially from its actual condition, it might have so affected the rays of light, that a corresponding difference from the ejes of existing Crustaceans would have been found in the organs on which the impressions of such were then received. Regarding light it- self, also, we learn, from the resemblance of these most ancient organizations to existing eyes, that the mutual relations of light to the e)e and of the eye to light, were the same at the time when Crustaceans endowed with the faculty of vision were first placed at the bot- tom of primaeval seas as at the present mo- ment." Light. — To the opinions of the ancients on the subject of light but little allusion need be made, as they were but crude and vague con- jectures. One, for instance, supposed that the eyes emitted emanations of some sort by which objects were, as it were, felt. Others ima- gined that visible objects were constantly throwing out from them spectral resemblances of themselves, which, when received by the eye, produced an impression of those objects ; but in these fanciful notions there is litile satisfaction, and we proceed at once to the hypothesis of our illustrious countryman, Sir Isaac Newton. According to his theory, light was an imponderable substance, whose inconceivably minute particles produced the sensation of light by their action on the eye : moving with immense velocity, they were nevertheless acted on by attractive and repul- sive forces residing in all material bodies, and by these forces were liable either to be turned aside from their natural straight course, re- flected by the repulsive force, or penetrating between the particles of bodies, to take a direction on quitting them finally determined by the position of the surface at which they emerged. About the same time, however, a very different hypothesis was advanced by Huyghens, to the effect that all space is filled wilh an extremely elastic and rare ether, and that light is the result of the undulatory movements communicated to this ether by self-luminous bodies, which movements being transmitted to the optic nerve, give rise to the sensation of light. The beautiful experi- ments of Dr. Thomas Young strongly con- firmed the truth of this theory') which is based upon the supposition that light acts by vibra- tions upon the retina, in the same manner as the undulations of the air striking upon the tympanum excite the sensation of sound. The velocity of the luminous undulations deduced by Romer from the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter, is proved to be about 192,500 miles in a second; in other words,VISION. 1437 light travels a distance equal to eight times the circumference of* the earth, between two beats of a clock. That white light was supposed by Newton to be composed of seven colours is too well known to need description here ; but the proportion of each colour, according to the observations of Newton and Fraiinhofer, is as follows : — Newton. Fraiinhofer. Red - - 45 - - 56 Orange - 27 - - 27 Yellow - 40 - - 27 Green - 60 - - 46 Blue - 60 - - 48 Indigo - 48 - - 47 Violet - 80 - - 109 360 360 It is to Sir David Brewster that we are in- debted for our knowledge of the fact, that the solar spectrum in reality consists of only three primary colours, red, yellow, and hlue ; each of which exists throughout the whole of the spectrum ; and that the super-position of these in different degrees of intensity in dif- ferent parts produces the seven hues. The proportion in which the primary colours coin- bine to form white light, is : — Yellow, three parts. Red, five parts. Blue, eight parts. All the seven hues are possessed of different degrees of refrangibility; the red being least refrangible, the violet the most. It appears from Sir John Herschell's experiments that just beyond the violet there exists a band of coloured light of still greater refrangibility, which he has denominated the lavender band. The same great philosopher has also proved that the coloured rays in the spectrum differ materially in the length and rapidity of their undulations. Coloured rays.

Sir William Herschell discovered that there are rays in the solar spectrum which give rise to the sensation of heat, independently of those of light, and these calorific rays are most abundant a little beyond the red ex- tremity of the spectrum, and gradually di- minish towards the violet, beyond which they are imperceptible ; an important practical fact has recently been discovered in relation to these rays. It is well known that plants growing in stove houses often suffer from the scorching influence of the calorific rays, and when the great palm-house at Kew was about to be erected, an elaborate series of experi- ments was undertaken by Mr. R. Hunt, to ascertain whether it would not be possible to cut them off by means of a tinted glass. In this he was fully successful, and discovered that a glass tinted of a very pale yel'.ow-green colour by oxide of copper completely pre- vented the permeation of all that class of heat rays which exists below, and in the point fixed at that of maximum calorific action ; as it is to this class of rays that the scorching in- fluence is due, the use of the glass described has effectually protected the plants. The absence of oxide of manganese commonly employed in all sheet gla^s, is insisted on, it having been found that such glass will, after exposure for some time to intense sun-light, assume a pinky hue, which is highly objectionable. To Dr. Wollaston we owe the discovery of the existence beyond the extreme violet of chemical rays, which are known to us solely by their effects. It is to their action that the fading of vegetable colours, and the blackening of nitrate of silver, is due. The influence of these chemical rays extends throughout the spectrum, and to it the term actinism has been applied. From the experiments of Mr. Hunt it appears that actinism exercises an important influence on the vegetable world, exciting th3 germination of seeds, and being essential to the formation of the colouring matter of leaves. The actinic principle is most energetic in spring, when its stimulus is required to rouse dormant vegetation from the repose of winter : as soon <• as this is effected, the luminous rays, with the advance of the sun, become more active, and the formation of woody fibre proceeds under their particular agency ; but in autumn, the actinic power having performed its part, is no longer required,, the whole energy of ve- getation being concentrated under the in- fluence of the calorific rays in the ripening of fruits and perfecting of seeds. It has been long known that the calorific and lumi- nous rays were capable of extinction by means of polarisation, but it has only been very re- cently ascertained by Professor Wartmann that the chemical rays are equally .amenable to polarisation under similar conditions. Those diversified colours which render the floral world so attractive, which impart such beauty to the feathered tribes and the legions of butterflies, and in brilliant pigments re- ward the labours of the chemist, are not pro- perties inherent in matter itself, but arise from the action of matter upon light, whereby certain of the coloured rays which form white light are reflected, whilst others are absorbed or transmitted. Scarlet cloth, for instanceVISION. 1139 absorbs almost all colours except red, which it reflects ; but those substances which reflect all the rays appear white; those which ab- sorb all are black. The brilliancy of tints is greatly increased when viewed in light of their own colour, as may be proved by throw- ing the red rays from a prism upon any scarlet object, or the green rays upon a green leaf. The colour of transparent substances depends upon their property of absorbing some of the colours of white light, and transmitting others. The blue tint of the atmosphere in reflected light, and its red morning and evening tinge, are to be ascribed to this cause. Dyes ami paints are substances Which, when applied to bodies, so change their sur- faces, that when seen in white light, they re- flect only the particular colour of the dye or paint. There are several modes by which white light can be reproduced, of which a simple one is, the rapid rotation of a disk painted in stripes, with the prismatic colours in the correct proportions. In this case, the eye receives the impression at the same time, and in the same place, of a red circle, an orange, a yellow circle, and so on, and conse- quently a white circle, since the sensation of white is but the simultaneous sensation of all these colours. As in the production of white light, it is necessary that all the simple colours should exist in their due proportions; so it is evident that by suppressing or increasing one the harmony will be destroyed, and the light will be no longer white. Thus, for instance, by suppressing red, we obtain a blueish green, which, compounded with red, would form white light. Whenever two colours, simple or compound, fulfil this condition, they are said to be complementary one to the other. They are as follows : — Colour. Red - Orange Yellow Green - Blue - Indigo - Violet - Black - White - Complementary. Blueish-green. Blue. Indigo. Violet-reddish. Orange-red. Orange-yellow. Yellow-green. White. Black. With respect to the production of light, bodies are divided into luminous and non- luminous ; among natural bodies some pos- sess in themselves the property of exciting in our eyes the sensation of brightness, or light, as the sun and other heavenly bodies which shine by their own light. There is also chemical light, or that produced by com- bustion, electric light, phosphorescent light, et cetera. Non-luminous bodies are such as become visible only when light falls upon them from some luminous source. Bodies are also divided into transparent and opaque, in reference to their capacity for transmitting light through their substance, though this property depends, not merely on their absolute transparency, but also on the density of the medium through which the light passes. There is no perfectly opaque or perfectly transparent substance known. Diamond is nothing more than charcoal in a different state of molecular aggregation, and gold can be made pervious to light. On the other hand, the purest air or clearest water gradually extinguishes by absorption the rays transmitted through them. According to Bouguer the purest sea water loses all its transparency at a depth of 730 feet, and the reason that more stars are visible from the summit of a lofty mountain than from the level of the sea is, because the light from the more distant stars becomes so much enfeebled during its passage through the lower strata of the atmosphere, that it has not sufficient power to affect the sight. If a pencil of rays diverging from a lumi- nous point fall upon the surface of a convex lens, they will not all be equally refracted. The ray which passes through the axis of the lens will not be changed in its course, but the remainder of the l^-s will be more and more refracted in proportion as they recede from the optical centre of the lens. When the rays pass out from a bi-convex lens into air they are refracted from a line perpendicular to the point of emergence: the effect is to cause them all to converge towards the cen- tral ray to a point at which they meet, called the focus. The distance between the focus and the refracting surface is the focal dis- tance or focal length, and is influenced by the refracting power of the lens, the amount of its curvature, and the distance of the lumi- nous body. Parallel rays entering any plano-convex or double convex lens at an equal distance from its axis, are concentrated to the same focal point, but as the peripheral rays are more refracted than the central rays, they are sooner brought to a focus; hence the image formed at the focus of the lens is somewhat indistinct at its edges. This imperfection is due to what is termed spherical aberration, and is counteracted either by shutting out the peri- pheral rays, or by such a combination of lenses as will establish a just proportion between the refraction of the central and peripheral rays. Such lenses are made of crown glass, com- posed of flint and alkali only, and flint glass, in which oxide of lead is added to the other materials. The latter possesses a much higher dispersive power than the crown glass; but the refraction of the rays is nearly the same in both, and when combined, achromatic lenses are obtained. This term is applied from their utility in obviating another source of con- fusion, chromatic aberration, which is caused by the unequal refrangibility of the prismatic rays when transmitted through an ordinary lens, whereby the images are fringed with colours, and are rendered even more indis- tinct than by spherical aberration. Newton supposed that an achromatic lens was an im- possibility ; but in 1757 Dollond completely succeeded in overcoming the difficulty by the1130 VISION. combination of crown and flint glass. He supposed the mean refractive power of flint glass, as compared to crown glass, to be 158 to 153 ; Fraiinhofer states it to be 164 to 153. The prismatic dispersion in English flint glass is 1^ times, but in Fraiinhofer's, it is twice as great as in crown glass. Such are the chief facts concerning light, which bear reference to vision : to the con- sideration of the physiology of which we now proceed. Phenomena of Vision. — The special function with which the retina is endowed being the perception of light, a marvellous range of phenomena is open to the inquirer. It is indeed a wonderful thing to have ascertained beyond doubt, that in perceiving the tint of the scarlet geranium our eyes are affected by undulations recurring four hundred and eighty- two millions of millions of times in a second ; that before we can appreciate the tint of the yellow blossoms of the gorse or laburnum, five hundred and forty-two millions of mil- lions of vibrations must have taken place ; and that to discriminate the colour of the violet, not less than seven hundred and seven millions of millions of movements must have been communicated to the fibrillse of our re- tinae ! Whilst such facts almost transcend the powers of human conception, their esta- blishment is a striking triumph of human in- tellect. But how great ought to be our admiration of that Omnipotence which has endowed the eye with the gilt, not merely of appreciating one colour, but of distinguishing, in all their shades, the inexpressibly compli- cated vibrations which mark the hues of a parterre of flowers, and characterise the gor- geous plumage of the birds which give anima- tion to a tropical forest. The sense of sight, in its ordinary acceptation, may be defined as the recognition by the mind of certain im- pressions made upon the retina, and commu- nicated through the medium of the optic nerve to the encephalon ; a sound condition of each and all of these parts (which may be considered as the media of communication, so far as one sense is concerned, between the external world and the mind) is indispensable for perfect vision. Light may f dl upon the retina, and the images of objects may be there depicted, but should the optic nerve be un- sound, or certain portions of the brain be disorganised, no responsive image is called up before the mind ; the eye may gaze upon the noonday sun, but all is dark within. The natural stimulus of the retina is the luminous rays : the appreciation of light and colour its active condition ; and its state of repose suggests the appearance of darkness : but besides light, any other excitement ap- plied to the retina or optic nerve gives rise to the same result, — the production of luminous appearances. Pressure upon the eye-ball, the electric current, or vascular congestion, all excite this special phenomenon. Occasion- ally, too, irritation of the brain has the same effect ; and many are the waves and corrus- cations, the fiery clouds and flaming spectra, which haunt the amaurotic when certain morbid complications exist. The phantasms of fever, and the illusions of the dying, are to be placed in the same category with the above. For visual purposes, a certain amount of stimulation of the retina is .necessary ; hence it is both difficult and painful to discern ob- jects in very faint light : but in this respect the retina is endowed with great powers of accommodation. It is well known that per- sons long immured in dungeons profoundly dark to ordinary eyes, have acquired the power of discerning the most minute objects. On the other hand, excessive light is in- jurious, for by it vision may be instantane* ously extinguished, as happens by a stroke of lightning. The accommodation to various amounts of light is, however, gradual, as is proved bypassing from a dark room into sun- light, or into a brilliantly lighted apartment. In this case the pupil has been widely dilated to admit the greatest possible quantity of light into the eye. For the first second or two after arriving in the light, all is confusion; and there is even pain, from the flood of light which thus breaks in on the retina through the widely dilated pupil, and takes it, as it were, unawares. On the other hand, a per- son entering a moderately dark room from full sunlight, sees nothing for a time, because the strongly contracted pupil admits so little light, that no sensation is produced. After a while the pupil dilates, and vision gradually becomes complete. In order that a clear idea may be formed of the mode in which images are depicted upon the retina, and also of the causes of myopia and presbyopia, it is neces- sary that the mode of action of convex lenses should be described. Fig. SSL Let c d be a biconvex lens, and a b an ob- ject on one side of it, but further removed than the focal point F. Every point of the object will send forth rays in all direc- tions, but to avoid confusion, we will only consider those flowing from the extremities AB. The rays emitted from a undergo re- fraction, are altered in their direction, and are united at a' upon the secondary axes drawn from a through g, the centre of the lens. The rays from B are in like manner united at b'; consequently, a'b' is the image of the object ab, but inverted. Seen from the middle of the lens, the image and object appear at the same angle, for the angle b'ga' is equal to the angle bga, being angles at the vertex. The relative size of the object or the image depends upon the relative distance ofVISION. 1410 each from the lens. If the object lie twice as far as the focal distance from the lens, the image will be formed on the other side at an equal distance, consequently the image and the object are equal in size. But if the object approach nearer to the glass, the image will recede, becoming larger. We thus obtain in- verted and enlarged images of objects stand- ing further from the lens than the focal dis- tance, yet not so far as twice that distance. Tims the image a'b' is larger than the object A b. If the object be further removed from the glass than twice the focal distance, the image will be nearer ; we therefore obtain in- verted diminished images of distant objects. Dioptric phenomena.—Krause has described the anterior surface of the cornea as being spherical, the posterior parabolic. We re- cently had an opportunity of examining a human cornea in less than an hour after the eye had been extirpated from the living subject, and satisfied ourselves that, in that case at least, the two surfaces were perfectly parallel. According to Chossat the figure of the cornea is an elhpso'd of revolution about the major axis, which axis determines the axis of the eye. The ratio of the semi-axis of this ellipse to the excentrieity he determines at 1'3 ; and this being nearly the same with the index of refraction, parallel rays incident on the cornea in the direction of its axis will be made to converge, with great exactness, to a focus si- tuated behind it, the aberration, which would have existed had the external surface been of a spherical figure, being almost completely destroyed. The form of the crystalline lens is that of a solid of revolution, having its anterior surface much less curved than its posterior: by some authorities both surfaces are described as being ellipsoids of revolution about their lesser axes ; but Krause found the posterior surface to have a parabolic curve, whose parameter was from 3|-w to b"\ He found aUo that the elliptic.il curve of the an- terior surface of the lens varied as regards its long axis, in different cases from ¥" to 5^/"; its short axis also varying from lf/// to Dr. Alhert de Graefe informs us that he has repeated these observations, and ascertained them to be correct. Valee states that he has found by a comparison of Krauss's measure- ments of the dimensions of the eye, that the exterior convex surfaces have exactly that geometrical form which produces foci free from deviations. He calls them optoidal sur- faces, and also finds that the posterior convex surfaces are at least so far optoidal, as the pencils of light penetrating into the eye in- fringe upon them. The axes of the two sur- faces of the lens are not exactly coincident in direction with each other, nor with that of the cornea. The refractive index of the surface of the lens is, according to Brewster, I '3767 ; of the centre 1-3990, the mean being 1-3839 : that of the vitreous humour is 1-.3394; thus the refractive density of the lens being greater than that of either the aqueous or vitreous humour, it exercises an important influence on the converging rays incident on it from the cornea. The effect of its elliptic figure is probably to correct the aberration of ob- lique pencils, and general aberration is still further obviated by the peculiar and varying density of its substance. By Professor James Forbes the variable density is supposed to alter the figure of the lens under pressure, and so to assist in focal adjustment. As the rays refracted by the aqueous hu- mour pass into the crystalline, and those from the crystalline into the vitreous humour, the indices of refraction of the separating sur- face of these humours will be, according to Brewster : — From aqueous humour to outer layer of crystalline - 104GG From ditto to crystalline, using the mean index ... - 1-Q353 From vitreous to crystalline outer layer 1-0445 From ditto to ditto, using the mean index ----- 1-0332 Suppose, then, the eye to be directed to- wards an object, the rays of light proceeding from that object are thus disposed of. Those which strike the cornea very obliquely are reflected, as are those which impinge upon the sclerotic; a large proportion of the rays, however, pass through the cornea, being power- fully refracted by it, and the aqueous mem- brane, and less by the aqueous humour behind : proceeding onwards, many of the rays are arrested by the iris, some being ab- sorbed, others reflected, conveying the colours and brilliancy characteristic of that membrane. The more central rays pass through the pupil and the crystalline lens. The layers of this body, increasing in density from the circum- ference to the centre, resemble in their effect upon the rays the atmosphere of this earth, which causes a gradual bending of the rajs flowing from the heavenly bodies ; so the crys- talline lens by its form and structure gradually but powerfully increases the convergence of the rays which penetrate it, both on their entrance and their exit. They then traverse the vitreous humour, ■—-the chief use of which appears to be to afford support to the expanded retina, —and are brought in a perfectly natural eye, to foci upon the retina, forming there an exact but inverted picture of the object. If the eye of a white rabbit or any other albino be carefully cleansed, the flame of a taper held before the cornea may be seen inverted at the back of the eye, increasing in size as the taper is brought near, diminishing if it retires, and ever moving in the direction opposite to that given to the flame. Such, in general terms, are the phenomena attending the formation of images in the eye; and they are strictly in accordance with the mode of action of convex lenses, of which the rule is, that an image formed by a convex lens is inverted, and its position relatively to the position of the object and its magnitude, are to that of the object as its distance from the lens is to the distance of the object from the lens. The rays composing a pencil fallingVISION. 1441 upon the cornea, are refracted by the trans- parent media of the eye in proportion to the difference between the density of these media, and that of the air, and in proportion to the curves presented by their several surfaces. It is of course the central ray only, or that which passes through the axis of the eye, that is not refracted ; all the other rays un- dergo refraction, and are approximated to the central ray. The prime rays have been termed rays of direction, because every prime or axial ray determines the direction of the other rays. As every object emits rays, from every point, in all directions, which rays then proceed in straight lines, it necessarily follows that, un- dergoing these refractions, there must be some point in the eye at which the axial rays of the different pencils, proceeding from the ob- ject, cross ; and this appears to be very near the centre of the eye, somewhat behind the crystalline. Sir D. Brewster places it in the geometric centre of the eje-ball, consequently a little within the crystalline lens ; and Volk- mann has described the point of intersection as being 3'" 97 behind the cornea,0'" 43 before the posterior surface of the crystalline, and 23 in front of the retina. Other and very careful observers, however, place it at a very short distance behind the crystalline lens. It is called the focal centre, and the angle formed by the intersecting axial rays from two points is the visual angle. This focal centre seems, according to the researches of Ruete, to be of importance in another way. In the steady contemplation of objects, we have to bring them into the focal centre of the produced visual axis; and in the motion by which this is accomplished, it would appear that the eye revolves accurately round a point, which point of revolution is the focal centre of the eye. In vision, the muscles of the two eyes act under the influence of the will, with a remark- able and admirable sympathy ; and it is on this harmonious consent, as it were, of op- posing muscles, that vision in its most perfect form depends. Vision under water is attended with some curious consequences, the result of what is termed "internal" reflection. An eye placed under perfectly still water, as for instance, the eye of a diver, will see external objects only through a circular aperture (as it were) of 06° 5j' 20'' in diameter overhead. But ail objects down to the horizon will be visible in this space; those near the horizon being much distorted and contracted in dimensions, espe- cially in height. Beyond the limits of this circle will be seen the bottom of the water, and all subaqueous objects reflected and as vividly depicted, as by direct vision ; and in addition, the circular space above mentioned will appear surrounded with a rainbow of faint but delicate colours. In the eyes of fishes, the humours being nearly of the refractive density of the medium in which they live, the action of bringing the rays to a focus on the retina is almost entirely performed by the crystalline lens, which is nearly spherical and of small radius in comparison with the whole diameter VOL. IV. of the eye; there is also a very great in- crease of density towards the centre, whereby spherical aberration is obviated, the corneal refraction having little influence. When speaking of light we have mentioned spherical and chromatic aberrations ; and it is necessary that they should be again alluded to in reference to the eye. Spherical aberration is beautifully counteracted by the figure and vary- ing density of the crystalline lens; which, in- creasing in refractive power towards the centre, refracts the central rays in each pencil, to the same point as its external rays: bur an important agent in obviating this aberration is the iris, which is, as it were, perpetually on the watch to limit the rays entering the eye to those which produce a perfect image, cutting off others which, by their obliquity of incidence, might occasion the imperfection in question. Opticians endeavour to obtain the same effect in their instruments by the employment of an opaque screen or diaphragm ; but no device of human art can equal the ever changing pupil of the living eye. Sir David Brewster, and some other autho- rities, deny that the eye is perfectly free from chromatic aberration: and it is certain that when the pupil is dilated by belladonna, and the lateral rays freely admitted, coloured fringes are perceptible, as we have ourselves experienced ; on the other hand, the forms and relative densities of the humours of the eye closely imitate the achromatic combina- tion of lenses, for the two menisci, formed by the aqueous and vitreous humours, having the double convex crystalline lens, of greater density than either, placed between them, fiiifil these conditions very happily, and can hardly fail to obviate, in a material degree, chromatic aberration. The coloured fringes we have spoken of, as being produced by the dilatation of the pupil, must not be confounded with the chromatic images, which depend on certain conditions of the retina. The former are always connected with refraction, and they attach particularly to two conditions, namely, the falling of a light close to a shadow, and the projection of the limits of either on the retina, in such a way that all sharpness of outline is lost. The transition from light to shade — the blending of the light and darkness thus produced—gives rise to coloured fringes. This may be shown by taking up a position, at the end of a room, before a brightly illu- minated window, and holding up any small object, such as a pencil, before the eye, which must be steadily fixed upon the window- sash. Presently prismatic colours appear on either side of the bars as well as of the pencil. Goethe explained all chromatic phe- nomena on the sole ground of modifications in light and shade. In the light seen through dull media, according to his theory, yellow is first perceived, then in succession, red, pale blue, blue, violet, black blue, and black ; and he explains dioptrically-formed coloured margins from the subjective side, by a mutual encroachment of the light and dark, the shadow before the light being perceived as blue and 4 zVISION. 1442 violet, and the light before the shadow as red and yellow. Distinct vision. — Dugald Stewart, in his " Philosophy of the Human Mind," proposes this question : Suppose the eye to be fixed in a particular position, and the picture of an object to be painted on the retina, does the mind perceive the complete figure of the ob- ject at once, or is this perception the result of the various perceptions we have of the dif- ferent points in the outline ? He arrives at the conclusion that the mind does at one and the same time perceive every point in the outline of the object, for perception, like con- sciousness, is an involuntary operation : as no two points, however, of the outline are in the same direction, every point by itself constitutes a distinct object of attention to the mind ; but these acts of attention are performed with such rapidity, that the effect is the same as if the perception were instantaneous. When the eye is directed to any point of a land- scape, it sees with perfect distinctness only that image of it which is directly in the axis of the eye; but the extreme mobility of the eve, together with the duration of the impres- sions upon the retina, enable us to take in every part of the view with equal distinctness. In all probability, it is only in the axis of the eye, corresponding with the yellow spot, that vision is perfect; the posterior part of the retina is certainly better adapted to receive images than the anterior, where the grey nervous layer becomes thinner and thinner towards the border. Dr. Young calculated that the range of motion in the eye-ball is 5o° in every direction, so that the head being fixed, a single eye may have perfect vision of any point within a range of 110°. He fur- ther ascertained, by fixing the eye in the most natural direction, namely, forwards, and a little downwards, and by then moving a luminous object before it in various direc- tions, that the range of vision upwards was 50°, downwards 70°, inwards 60°, and out- wards 90°, giving an entire horizontal play of lo()°, and a total vertical play of 120°. The small portion of retina corresponding to the extremity of the optic nerve, is insen- sible to visual impressions. Volkmann states that he has satisfied himself by calculation that the small insensible spot corresponds exactly with the dimensions of the central artery. Dr. Young determined that the dis- tance of the centre of the optic nerve from the visual axis is T\f7 of an inch, and that the diameter of the most insensible part of the retina is ^ of an inch. It is to be borne in mind that the fibrous lamina of the grey nervous layer of the retina is at this point evolving itself from the nerve, and is not yet invested with the vesicular or other laminae. Mr. Bowman has well remarked that this in- capacity of vision at the entrance of the optic nerve seems to be essential to the mode of junction of the retina with the nerve, since it appears to have been the chief reason why the nerve was not made to enter in the axis of the eye. If the blind spot had been situated in the axis, a blank space would have always existed in the centre of the field of vision, since the axis of the eyes in vision are made to correspond. But as it is, the blind spots do not correspond when the eyes are directed to the same object; and hence the blank which one eye would present, is filled up by the opposite eye. Mariotte, was the first who described the existence of these blind spots, and they may be discovered by the following simple experiment: — Let two black dots be placed one inch apart on a sheet of white paper: if the left eye be closed, and the dots are regarded at the usual distance for distinct vision, the attention, however, being particu- larly directed to that on the right hand, the other dot will be found to disappear the moment the pencil of rays proceeding from it falls upon the centre of the entrance of the optic nerve. It has been already stated, that when the rays from an object meet in foci on the retina, a distinct image is formed : should the focus, however, be before or beyond the retina, it is evident that some indistinctness must be caused, for each point of the retina would then receive rays from several points of the object. It is to be borne in mind, that the nearer the object to the eye, the greater is the divergency of the incident rays; and the greater their divergency, the more distant is their focus. When the retina corresponds, or nearly corresponds, to the points of con- vergence of the several pencils of light, dis- tinct vision is obtained, the usual distance being from eight to ten inches, at which dis- tance, reading or writing is naturally per- formed. If, when writing, for instance, we removed the head further, or approached it nearer, and no alteration took place in the eye, vision would become indistinct, because the focus would be altered, and would either fall short of, or be thrown beyond, the re- tina : should the rays, however, very nearly unite upon the retina, vision, of large ob- jects especially, may prove sufficiently dis- tinct, though not perfectly clear. A just distinction was, therefore, drawn by Jurin between perfect vision and distinct vision, the perfection of vision depending on the distance alone of objects, whilst their distinctness would be regulated not less by their size, than by their distance from the eye. The pupil of the eye performs an important part in enabling us to see objects distinctly. When looking intently at a near object, the pupil contracts, thereby limiting the rays which pass through it to the most central, and stopping the progress of those more di- vergent rays which, not converging to foci on the retina, would cause circles of dissipation ; upon the same principle, vision of near objects is assisted by a pin-hole aperture. Let a per- son thrust a pin through a card, and make a clean hole ; then let him hold a book so close to his eyes that the type becomes con- fused ; if he now looks through the pin-hole, he will again see it distinctly, because the card answers the same purpose as a furtherVISION. 1443 contraction of the pupil, arresting the progress of those rays which are too divergent, anil limiting those entering the eye to the central rays, which, from their trifling divergence, unite correctly on the retina. The same ad- vantage is gained hy a near-sighted, and by a presbyopic eye. In the one case vision is im- proved by the card stopping the rays, which woidd converge to foci in front of the retina ; in the other, by its arresting those which tend to foci behind the retina. So that tin's simple experiment frequently makes a difference of several inches in the vision of myopic and presbyopic persons. A curious experiment devised by Father Scheiner, has reference to this point. If we make in a card two small orifices with a needle, at a less distance from each other than the diameter of the pupil, and hold these openings close to the eye, a double image of a small object held within the visual distance, — a pin's head, for instance — will be seen. From the pin's head there pass two very minute pencils of rays through the apertures into the eye. These rays converge towards a point lying behind the retina, and fall upon the retina at two different points. These are two isolated points of the circle of dispersion, which would exist upon the retina, if the other rays were not intercepted by the card. If we now withdraw the pin's head more and more, the images will approach, because the rays, falling upon the eye through the apertures, will diverge less, and will conse- quently be refracted towards a point lying nearer to the retina. If the object be re- moved from the eye to the distance of distinct vision, the two images will perfectly coincide, since all rays passing from one point, lying exactly at the distance of distinct vision, will be concentrated at one point of the retina. It may be asked, what are the conditions of adaptation necessary for an eye in looking through a fine aperture? In its normal con- dition, for the maintenance of which no effort is necessary, the eye is in the state necessary for seeing objects which lie at the distance of distinct vision. If a distant object be re- garded through the small apertures, the rays passing through them into the eye must evi- dently meet at one point before the retina, as the condition of each adaptation does not change in the eye: but the two pencils di- verge again behind the point of intersection, striking the retina at two different points, when, consequently, distant objects will be seen double ; therefore, we only see a small object single, through two small apertures, when it lies at the distance of distinct vision. This experiment of Scheiner led Dr. Porter- field to invent an instrument called an op- tometer, for the determination of the focal distance of the eye ; and Dr. Young sub- sequently greatly improved upon it, his in- strument being simple in construction, and both convenient and accurate in its applica- tion. The greatest distance of human vision is so variable, that no arbitrary limits can be as- signed to it. Uncivilised tribes, as the North American Indians, the inhabitants of the im- mense Asiatic steppes, and the New Zealan- ders, possess powers of sight which are almost incredible. It is interesting, however, to remark, that the mean degree of capability of vision was the same among the ancient Greeks and Romans as at the present day. The Pleiades furnish the proof of this, showing that some thousand years ago, as now, stars which astronomers call of the seventh mag- nitude, were not visible to the naked eye in persons of ordinary powers of vision. Even among civilised nations, however, instances are occasionally met with of extraordinarily keen sight. General Drinkwater, in his 1 History of the Siege of Gibraltar," mentions that there were two boys in the garrison pos- sessed of such uncommon quickness of sight, that they could see the shots fired by the enemy almost immediately after they had quitted the guns, and were constantly em- ployed to look out and give warning to the soldiers of the approach of these missiles. From the experiments of Harris, it seems that a simple object, as a black square on a white ground, or a white square on a black ground, can be seen under a less angle than the equal parts of a compound object, as the squares of a chequered figure, and that their least, or minimum visible angle cannot be less than 40'': others, however, say 30". If it is 40", the size of the image on the retina will be -jijoo inch. At a medium, Harris thinks it not less than 2'. He remarks that the diffi- culty of keeping the eye perfectly steady, may be one cause why a single object can be dis- cerned under a less angle than the parts of a complex one ; and that it is natural to sup- pose that the fewer objects we contemplate, and the more they differ in colour, the easier we can distinguish their several impressions on the retina. The result of repeated and very careful experiments by Hueck, tends to show that white objects on a black ground are seen at a greater distance than black objects on a white ground *, and this is fully corroborated by an instance mentioned by Humboldt. This distinguished traveller wras with Bonpland, at * The following facts, deduced from extensive and very careful experiments, conducted by Lieut.- Colonel Hamilton Smith, are of great practical im- portance. The object was to ascertain the liability of different colours to be hit as marks, tinder pre- cisely similar circumstances, as to men engaged, size of target, weather, &c. The result showed the proportion to be as follows . — Red, 12. Rifle-green, 7. Austrian blueish-grey, 5. Colonel Derinzy, who was actively engaged in the Peninsular War, has given much attention to the effect of different coloured uniforms on the chances of being hit. The day before the battle of Vittoria, bis Portuguese rifle company, dressed in earthy-brown, and a company of British Fusileers, of equal strength, dressed in red, had to dislodge the French from a bridge. They were equally exposed during the whole of the skirmish, and after it was over, Colonel Derinzy compared notes with his Fusileer comrade, and found that the relative losses were precisely one to two.' This fact (for which we are indebted to Captain Nelson, r.e.) strikingly 4 z 2VISION. 1144 Chillo, near Quito, in South America, from whence the long extended ridge of the volcano of Pichincha is visible. Bonpland had pro- ceeded on an expedition to the volcano, and Humboldt, with others, was somewhat anxiously looking out for him. The Indians of the party recognised the traveller as a white point moving along the face of a black basaltic precipice, before he was discovered by Humboldt and others, who were looking out for him with telescopes (a proof, by the way, of their excellent vision) ; but in a short time the Europeans also were able to distinguish the white moving figure with the naked eye. The weather was clear, and the distance 14-8 geographical miles. A small object in motion, however, is more easily discerned than if at rest: by the gradual motion of the image over the retina, the impression upon each part con- tinuing for some time, the effect is the same as if a linear image were formed. Duration of impressions. — A beautiful pro- vision to insure uninterrupted vision, is afforded by the duration of impressions upon the retina, whereby we never lose sight of an object we are viewing, during the necessary winking of the eyelids. M. D'Arcy found that the light of a live coal, moving in a circle, at the distance of 165 feet, maintained its impression upon the retina somewhat more than the seventh part of a second. From the observations of Plateau, it seems that the interval of time, during which the impression retains the same intensity, is more consider- able in proportion as the light is moderated ; the mean duration of the impression excited by all the colours from the instant of their maximum intensity till their entire disap- pearance, being one-third of a second in a dark room, and one-sixth of a second in a light room. If two or more impressions suc- ceed each other at such short intervals that the first has not faded away before the next commences, they run one into another, the eye seeming to receive but a single impression ; as, for example, the appearance of a circle of fire from a revolving burning stick — when it is in reality the combination of many indi- vidual impressions succeeding each other with rapidity : upon this depends many of the most beautiful examples of the pyrotechnic art; from the same cause a flash of lightning ap- pears as a continuous line of light, because the light emitted at any point of the line remains upon the retina until the cause of the light passes over the succeeding points. In order that an object may become visible, it is necessary that the retina should be exposed to its influence for an appreciable time, a fact first pointed out by Lord Bacon, who observes, that notwithstanding the rapidity of the act of vision, a certain time is required for its ex- ercise, which is proved by certain objects, as, for instance, a musket-ball, being invisible on corroborates Colonel Smith's results: hence it ap. pears that the liability of brown is =6, and that red is by far the most fatal colour, green next, then brown, and Austrian grey the least. account of the velocity of their motion; for the flight of the ball, he remarks, is too swift to allow an impression of its figure to be con- veyed to the sight. This subject has been recently investigated with much success by Mr. William Swan*, who arrives at the fol- lowing conclusions. When the eye receives a succession of flashes of equal duration from a light of con- stant intensity, which succeed each other so rapidly as to produce a uniform impression, the intensity of this aggregate impression will also be constant, provided the number of flashes in a given time varies inversely with the duration of each. The brightness of the impression produced by flashes of light of a given intensity, which succeed each other so rapidly as to "produce a uniform impression on the eye, is proportional to the number of flashes in a given time. When light of a given intensity acts on the eye for a short space of time, the brightness of the luminous impression on the retina is exactly proportional to the time during which the light continues to act. This law has been proved to be true for impressions lasting from T¥4¥^ to i% °f a second. The intensity of the impression produced by light, which acts on the eye for T£Ty of a second, is almost exactly Tyh of the apparent brightness of the light when seen by uninter- rupted vision ; and the time required for light to produce its full effect on the eye seems to be about J<y of a second. Lights of different intensities produce their complete impressions on the eye in equal times, so that the light of the sun requires the same time as common artificial light to produce its impression on the eye. The brightness of an impression on the eye increases with a rapidity exactly pro- portional to that of the light by which it is produced. Rays of different refrangibility act on the eye with equal rapidity. The apparent bright- ness of the spark produced by electricity of high tension is only about tooooo °f what its apparent brightness would become if its duration were prolonged to T\j of a second ; and the brightness of electric light increases with the tension of the electricity. The wonderful rapidity of the electric light is shown by the following experiments: —Viewed by the illumination of an electric spark, the spokes of a wheel in the most rapid rotation appear stationary, vibrating cords seem to be in a state of repose, and a succession of drops, which generally appear to the eye as a con- nected stream, is seen to be but a succession of drops, because the impression of each image lasts for so short a time that the posi- tion of the moving bodies is not altered. The light of electricity of high tension has a less duration than the millionth part of a second. When on the subject of light, we have alluded to the reproduction of the impression of white light by the rapid revolution of a disk * Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xvi. p. 581.VISION. 1445 4 z 3 painted with the prismatic colours; and Pla- teau describes an experiment which leads to a singular result. He takes two disks of exactly the same size, made of thick while paper, and divides one into eight equal sectors, of which two and two, corresponding and opposite ones, are coloured red, white, blue, and black. The second disk is coloured entirely black, two sections lying opposite to one another, and rather shorter and narrower than those of the first disk, being cut out. Both disks are then attached to rollers which are as much equal to one another as possible. They are placed vertically behind one another, so that the axes of rotation coincide, and the rollers are set in motion by cords which pass over two wheels, as nearly as possible equal to one another. The posterior coloured disk, which is rendered transparent by varnish, is well lighted from behind by a lamp. On rotation of the disks the whole field at first appears black, but, by gradual transitions, it passes into red, then white, and lastly into blue. The stimulus of vivid light produces an effect upon the retina which is stronger and lasts longer, in proportion to the intensity of the primitive effect. The after-images of light objects will be light, and those of dark objects dark, if the eye be withdrawn from all subse- quent action of light. If, for instance, we look long through a window towards the clear sky, and, turning suddenly away, close the eye, we shall see the light intervening spaces bounded by the dark window frames ; but if, on the contrary, the eye be turned towards a white wall, the after-image of the frame will appear light, and the intervening spaces dark. The reason is, that if the eye, already dazzled, be turned towards the white surface, the parts of the retina previously affected by the bright light will be less sensitive to the white light of the wall, than those parts on which the image of the dark window frames has fallen, and which has therefore not been unduly stimu- lated. If the bright sun, or the intense light resulting from the combustion of lime in oxygen, be gazed upon, the spectrum continues for a long period, and if the eye be closed, it pas.-es through a series of colours until it dis- appears. The white is followed by yellow, orange, red, green, violet, and finally black, one after the other in regular succession. Sir Isaac Newton experimented upon this subject, and ran a great risk of blinding himself thereby, as is described by him in a letter to John Locke, dated June 30th, 1691. After detail- ing the various steps of his experiment of gazing on the sun, and observing the subse- quent phantasm, he says, — " At length by repeating this, without looking any more on the sun, I made such an impression on my eye, that if I looked upon the clouds, or book, or any bright object, I saw before it a round bright spot like the sun; and, which is still stranger, though I looked upon the sun with my right eye only, and not with my left, yet my fancy began to make an impression upon my left eye as well as upon my right. For if I shut my right eye and looked upon a book or a cloud with my left eye, I could see the spectrum of the same almost as plain as with- out my right eye if I did but intend my fancy a little while upon it: for at first if I shut my right eye, and looked with my left, the spectrum of the sun did not appear till I in- tended my fancy upon it; but by repeating this it appeared every time more easilj'. And now in a few hours' time 1 had brought my e3'es to such a pass, that I could look on no bright object with either eye, but I saw the sun before me, so that I durst neither write nor read: but to recover the use of my eyes, shut myself up in my chamber made dark for three days together, and used all means to direct my imagination from the sun ; for if I thought upon him, I presently saw his picture, though I was in the dark: but by keeping in the dark, and employing my mind upon other things, I began in three or four days to have some use of my eyes again, and by forbearing to look upon bright objects, recovered them pretty we'll, though not so well but that, for some months after, the spectrum of the sun began to return as often as I began to meditate on the phenomena, even though I lay in bed at midnight with my curtains drawn." Dimensions of Objects.—With the represen- tation of external tilings by means of the organ of vision, the mind combines its knowledge of their size and distance. We infer the real magnitude of an object from its apparent mag- nitude, or from the angle under which its rays intersect each other in the eye ; our know- ledge of its actual distance from us is merely a deduction of our judgment arrived at through the sensations excited in the eye according to the different positions of objects, and such sensations are regulated by the angle of vision. Foi instance, we infer the increased distance of an object of known size, as a man, from the decrease of the visual angle. The angle of parallax, or that angle which the axis of the eyes when directed towards an object fjrms with it at the point of contact, is also to be taken into account, for it becomes greater in proportion to the nearness of the object. We are further aided by the position of the object relatively to other known objects, but here, in forming our conception of true dimensions, we are largely assisted by the lessons of experi- ence. The infant will grasp at the moon ; and it is by degrees that it acquires such experi- ence and judgment that the original percep- tions of sight become signs of the tangible qualities of external objects, and the distances at which they are placed. In determining the relative distances of objects one to another, we are principally guided by the angle of vision; yet what an exercise of judgment is implied, founded on a comparison of a variety of dif- ferent circumstances, and involving a complex mental operation, when a magnificent prospect is displayed to our view, and by an instanta- neous act of the mind we become aware of the various distances at which all the com- ponent parts are placed, the size of each indi- vidual part, and the relation held by each to the others. Here however, clearness of at-1116 VISION. mosphere and a sufficient amount of light are of importance, for every one must be aware bow deceptive is the estimate of the size of an object when seen through a fog, or looming large in the gloom of the evening. Some persons are gifted, as it were, intui- tively with the power of judging correctly of the true dimensions of objects. Napoleon possessed this in an eminent degree. He could tell at a glance the number of men com- posing a distant mass of troops, and the space of ground they would cover when deployed. In doing this a mental computation must have taken place unconsciously, rapid as thought, and based on a combination of great powers of calculation, long experience, and profound knowledge of the subject. For the production of a distinct image on the retina it is necessary that it be of a certain magnitude, which will depend on the suscep- tibility of the eye. We may here observe that the apparent magnitude of an object must not be confounded with its apparent superficial magnitude, the term being applied to its linear magnitude. The apparent superficial magni- tude varies in proportion to the squares of the apparent magnitude. The image of an object moderately illuminated must be O'OOl of an inch long, or the extreme rays of light must form an angle of half a minute in the eye at a minimum ; whence it follows that an object of mean illuminating power will be visible if its distance is not greater than 08,000 or 69,000 times its greatest length. Strongly luminous bodies, as the fixed stars, are visible at infi- nitely small visual angles. They excite in the eye merely a sensation of light, without creat- ing any impression as to their apparent mag- nitude. The disk of the moon subtends a visual angle of half a degree, the diameter of its picture on the retina will be of an inch, and the entire superficial magnitude of the image the ^i-loo-th of a square inch ; yet forms of light and shade are perceptible whose linear dimensions occupy upon the re- tina a space whose diameter does not exceed the 5005000 °t'a square inch. The eye in a healthy condition is capable of reading print in the light of the full moon, and that of the noon- day sun, their intensities being to each other as 1 to 300,000. Plateau asserts that white may be distinctly seen in the light of the sun at an angle of 12'', yellow at an angle of 13", red at 23", anil blue at 26", but that in ordinary day- light these angles must be half as large again. In estimating the motions of objects, we are guided by the movement of their images on the retina; and unless a body moves in such a manner that the line of vision shall describe at least one degree in each minute of time, its motion will not be perceptible; for which reason we are not conscious of the move- ments of the heavenly bodies. The more nearly at right angles to the line of vision the direction of the motion is, the greater will be the apparent motion produced by any real movement of an object. Erect Vision. — A variety of explanations have been offered to account for objects not being seen reversed, according to the position in which they are depicted on the retina ; but it would appear that by many a sufficient distinction has not been drawn between seeing the image and seeing by means of it. A little reflection shows that the actual perception of the object takes place in the sensorium, and that the image on the retina is only a necessary step in the pro- cess. In truth, we have no notion of upright or inverted, except that which is founded on experience. A man is upright whose head is upwards, and his feet downwards. Whatever be our standard of up or down, the sensible representation of up will always be an image moving on the retina towards the lower side, and the sensible representation of doivn will be a motion towards the upper side. The head of the man's image is towards the image of the sky ; its feet are towards the image of the ground ; and consequently it cannot ap- pear otherwise than upright. So, as all objects are inverted on our retinae, they do not change their relation one with another, and our only knowledge of position is from relative rela- tion, therefore we may truly say that we do not see the image on the retina, but by means of it. For every image on the retina, we sub- stitute an object, and seek in a definite direc- tion for the object corresponding to a definite image on the retina. In this we are assisted by other perceptions of sense, there existing the greatest harmony between such percep- tions in respect to locality. Dr. Alison, in an able paper*, advances the opinion, that the harmony between the inti- mations acquired by sight and by touch, as to the relative position of objects or their parts, notwithstanding that the impressions made by them on the external organs of sight and of touch are arranged inversely in regard to one another, arises from the course of the optic nerves and tractus optici, whereby im- pressions on the upper part of the retina are in fact impressions of the lower part of the op- tic lobes —that is to say, of the sensorium — and impressions on the outer part of the retina are, in like manner, on the inner part of the sensoi ium. This theory was first suggested by Mr. Dick, a veterinary surgeon ; but though ingenious, can hardly be considered satisfac- tory, as it implies the necessity for con- ditions which cannot always be fulfilled : and truly the question is of a nature not to be decided merely by anatomical inquiry. Kepler's explanation of objects appearing erect to us is, that the mind, perceiving the impulse of a ray on the lower part of the re- tina, conceives this ray to be directed from a higher part of the object, and vice versa. Por- terfield argues that the mind never sees any picture painted on the retina, and consequently never judges of the object from what it ob- serves in the picture; and that in seeing any * On Single and Correct Vision, by means of Double and Inverted Images on the Retina?, Trans- actions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xiii. p. 472.VISION. 1447 4- z 4 object the mind, by virtue of a connate immu- table law, traces buck its own sensation from the sensorium to the retina, and from thence outwards, along right lines drawn perpen- dicularly from every point of the retina on which any impression is made by the rays forming the picture, towards the object itself, by which means the mind always sees every point of the object, not in the sensorium or retina, but without the eye, in these perpen- dicular lines. But these lines nearly coincide with the axes of the several pencils of rays that flow to the eye from the several points of the object ; and since the mind has also a power of judging rightly of the distance of objects, it follows that every point of the object must appear and be seen in the place wheie it is, and consequently the object must appear in its true erect position, notwithstand- ing its picture on the retina is inverted. This theory of lines of visible direction Reid regards as a law of nature, of which our seeing objects erect, from inverted images, is a necessary consequence. Sir David Brewster too believes that erect vision results from the lines of visible direction being in all cases perpen- dicular to the impressed part of the retina ; but Miiller offers the following objections: — " The hypothesis that erect vision is the re- sult of our perceiving, not the image on the retina, but the direction of the rays of light which produce it, involves an impossibility, since each point of the image is not formed by rays having one determinate direction, but by an entire cone of rays. And, moreover, vision can consist only in the perception of the state of the retina itself, and not of any thing lying in front of it in the external world. The hypothesis also that the retina has an outward action, and that objects are seen in the direc- tion of decussating lines, that is to say, in the direction of the perpendicular of each point of the concavity of the retina, is a perfectly arbi- trary assumption; since there is no apparent reason why one direction should have the pre- ference rather than another, and each ultimate sensitive division of the retina, if it had the power of action beyond itself, would act in as many directions, as radii might be drawn from it towards the exterior world." * Notwith- standing these objections, the law of visible direction affords the most satisfactory expla- nation of"the phenonmena of erect vision ; all, however, we know positively is, that in the or- dinary exercise of vision, the mind infers the positions of objects from an impression made upon the retina, and that it as certainly draws the right conclusion therefrom. This, however, is not more wonderful than that the undulations of the luminous particles should excite the sensation of light in the retina, or that vibrations acting on the auditory nerve should give rise to sound. We may heap conjecture on conjecture as to the final cause of these phenomena, but we must stop at the limits to the boundaries of human knowledge. The profound resources of the Divine Intelligence excite our wonder and exalt our thoughts, but there are a thousand things abstractedly possible which set at nought our comprehension. 1 It is curious that such an acute mind as that of the late eminent metaphysician, Dr. Brown, should have been so satisfied that the perception of the number and position of visible objects is acquired only by association or custom, that he dismissed the subject thus curtly:—"In the single vision of the erect ol ject from a double image of the object in- verted, there is nothing at all mysterious to any one who has learnt to consider how much of the visual perception is referable to associa- tion. If the light reflected from a single ob- ject touched by us had produced, not two merely, but two thousand, separate images in our eyes, erect or inverted, or in any inter- mediate degree of inclination, the visual feel- ing thus excited would still have accompanied the touch of a shig/e object; and if only it had accompanied it uniformly, the single object would have been suggested by it, precisely in the same manner as it is now suggested by the particular visual feeling that now attends the double inverted image." * It has been justly remarked by Dr. Alison, that if it were only by experience and association with the perceptions of touch that we learned that any object placed before the eyes, and seen by two images, is nevertheless single, we might reasonably conclude that we should never see an object double which we know by touch to be single ; whereas we all know, that if by pressure on the ball of one eye, or by any other means we direct the axes of the two eyes to different points in an object, we imme- diately see it double, and cannot by any means avoid seeing it double so long as that con- dition of the eyes continues, notwithstanding the full conviction, derived from touch, of its being single. This tangible theory (if the ex- pression may be used) has found little favour, but having met with the support of so able a man as Dr. Brown, it could not be passed over in silence. Single Vision. — When both eyes, acting simultaneously, are directed to an object, a single image only is seen. A variety of opinions have existed with reference to this interesting point, some of them sufficiently singular. Gassendi, Du Tour, Porta, and Gall, for in- stance, asserted that we do not make use of more than one of our eyes at a time, the other being relaxed, and inattentive to objects. Dr. Brig_;s supposed that single vision was owing to the equal tension of the corresponding parts of the optic nerves, whereby they vibrated in a synchronous manner ; and Dr. Reid was of opinion that the correspondence of the two eyes, on which single vision depends, arose from some natural constitution of the eye and mind. Porterfield sa)s that the true cause why objects do not appear double, depends on the faculty we have of seeing things in the place where they are, every point of an object * Elements of Physiology, by Baly, p. 1171. * Lecture 29.VISION. 1 448 being seen nearly in a straight line drawn per- pendicularly to the retina from that point of it where its image falls and this law of visible direction may be regarded as exercising an important influence on the production of single vision. In reference to this phenomenon, it is ne- cessary to advert to the remarkable structure of the commissure of the optic nerve. The chiasma results from the junction of the optic tracts, in front of and inferior to the tuber cinereum. The fibres which constitute the inner margin of each tract, b, are continued Fig. 885. across from one side of the brain to the other, forming no connection with the optic nerves, and existing where those nerves do not exist, as in the mole. These fibres may be con- sidered as commissural between the thalami of opposite sides. The remaining fibres of the tracts go to form the optic nerves, the cen- tral passing across to the nerve of the oppo- site side, and the outermost, c c, passing to the optic nerve of the same side. Besides these, the two retina? are brought into direct connection by the fibres, a, which form the anterior border of the chiasma. From this arrangement it appears that corresponding parts of the two retinae are brought into relation one to the other, in the same manner as corresponding parts of the cerebral con- volutions are linked together by the various commissures: the right side of each retina appears also to be continuous with the right optic tract, and the left side of each with the left jthus each side of the central apparatus is brought into communication with its'own side of both retinal images, which may be supposed to favour their conception as one. The learned Arabian Alhazen supposed that when corresponding points of the two retinae are affected, the mind perceives one image ; this opinion has found favour ■ but Dr. Todd and Mr. Bowman, and also Dr. Alison have especially pointed out the importance of the decussation of the commissural fibres. Dr. Alison arrives at the conclusions : first, that certainly in some, and probably in all animals, the structure of the optic nerve brings the impressions which form inverted images on the retina into the same order on the sensorium as those which might result from the touch of the same objects ; secondly, that in those animals which can direct both eyes to one point, the partial decussation of the optic nerves, generally if not universally present, enables the images produced by an object on the corresponding parts of the retinae of the two eyes to co-operate in pro- ducing one impression on the sensorium, and one sensation in the mind; and lastly, that the decussation which takes place in the cor- pora pyramidalia affords correct information as to objects of sight from impressions made on them simultaneously in both optic lobes, — that is to say, on boih sides of the senso- rium,— notwithstanding that the impression on each side of the sensorium comes from the opposite side of the object in view. Thus it will be seen that Dr. Alison refers the con- nection of sight with touch to the decussation of the corpora pyramidalia. We may fairly conclude that there must be some structural provision in the organisation of the cerebral portion of the visual apparatus, which favours the perception of a single image from a double impression, and keeps in perfect harmony the important senses in question: how far the corpora pyramidalia may be concerned, is matter of speculation. The precise action of the mind, by which the single image only is appreciated, is of course unknown to us, but an additional argument in favour of the part performed by the chiasma is afforded by the occurrence of cases where only half an object or word is seen when both eyes are directed to it. Thus, as has been humorously illustrated by Dr. Hull, the word patriot becomes riot; ami of matrimony, only mony is seen. Such phenomena are (as remarked by Dr. Todd and Mr. Bowman) readily explained by supposing the anatomical arrangement of the sides of the retina, with regard to the optic tracts, to be such as has been described, since any derange- ment of one optic tract would then affect the same part of both optic images. For the production of single vision, it is necessary that the muscles which move both eyes should act in perfect concert. The effect of this is, that the axes of the eyes converge towards the object to which they are adjusted, and the image falls on corre- Fig. 88G. sponding parts of the two retinae. Let a b be the two eyes, and c any object before them. Then AC, cc are their axes, which meet in c. An image is consequently pro- duced in each eye which will correspond with the perspective projection of the object from the points a and b. If the two images are un- symmetrically placed, so that the axes meet either before or behind the object, a double sensation is exeited, as happens in strabismus, and the double vision of intoxication. The upper sides of both retinae correspond, as do the lower; and the outer side of each corresponds with the inner side of the other ; but the objects and corresponding points of the retinae shouldVISION. 1419 lie in a certain circle, designated the horopter; a circle which passes at once through point of coincidence, /, of the visual axes, / l>, and the points of decussation, c e' these axes with the lines of direction.

Fts. 888. Let c c' be the centres of the eyes a b, / the point regarded, Ice' the horopter, a and b the points of the retina on which the axes of the eyes terminate; and let m be a second point in the horopter. The point / appears upon the axial points a and b, the point in at o and p; a line betwixt Im will form the chord of the arc of the horopter lying between / and m ; and as all triangles drawn upon the arc of a circle have equal peripheral angles, so is the angle / c m equal to the angle I c'm. Both are farther equal to the opposite angles o c a, p e' b. Moreover o c is equal to p c, and a c to b c', as radii proceeding from the centres c and c' of the retinal circles, which in each eye have an equal circumference. Consequently o is just as far from the axial point a, as p is from the axial point /; ; and so identical or corresponding points of the retina are affected by the rays proceeding from both / and m. It is, however, to be borne in mind, that though impressions made on non-cor- responding points of the middle portions of the two retime are perceived as two, impres- sions made on non-corresponding points of the circumferential parts are not so perceived, the distance between such points being within certain limits. When an object is viewed at so great a distance that the optic axes of both eyes are sensibly parallel when directed towards it, the perspective projections of it seen by each eye separately are similar, and the appearance to the two eyes is precisely the same as when the object is seen by one eye only. But this similarity no longer exists when the object is placed so near the eyes that to view it the optic axes must converge : under these con- ditions a different perspective projection of it is seen by each e} e ; and these perspectives Mr. Wheatstone has shown that the single sensation excited by these two images is that of a third image different from them both, but excitable only by both of them at once, and attended with the notion of solidity or projec- tion in relief. This he has illustrated by a most ingenious instrument called the stereo- scope. Accurate representations are drawn of the appearance presented by an object of three dimensions, when viewed by each eye at a short distance. These drawings are then placed symmetrically in the right and left compartments of a small box, so as to be reflected by sloping mirrors to the eyes of the observer, who must place them as near as possible to these mirrors ; then, by moving sliding panels to or from him, he will find a position, and one only, in which the bin- ocular image will be seen single, of its proper magnitude, and without fatigue to the eye, because in this position only the ordinary re- lation between the magnitude of the pictures on the retina, the inclination of the optic- axes, and the adaptation of the eye to distinct vision at different distances, are preserved. It being thus shown that there is an essential difference in the appearance of objects when seen with both eyes, and when only one eye is employed; and that the most vivid belief of the solidity of an object of three dimensions arises from two different perspective projec- tions being simultaneously presented to the mind, the question arises, how is it that per- sons who see with only one eye form correct notions of solid objects, and never mistake them for pictures ? and how happens it that a person having the perfect use of both eyes perceives no difference in objects around him when he shuts one of them? To explain these apparent difficulties, says Mr. Wheat- stone, it must be kept in mind that, although the simultaneous vision of two dissimilar pic- tures suggests the relief of objects in the most vivid manner, yet there are other signs which suggest the same ideas to the mind, and are less liable to lead the judgment astray in pro- portion to the extent of our previous expe- rience. The vividness of relief arising from the projection of two dissimilar pictures, oneVISION. 1150 on each retina, becomes less and less as the object is seen at a greater distance from the eyes, and entirely ceases when it is so distant that the optic axes are parallel while regarding it. We see, with both eyes, all objects beyond this distance precisely as we see near objects with a single eye ; for the pictures on the two retinae are then exactly similar, and the mind appreciates no difference, whether two iden- tical pictures fall on corresponding parts of the two retinae, or whether one eye is im- pressed with only one of these pictures. A person deprived of the sight of one eye sees therefore all external objects, near and remote, as a person with both eyes sees remote objects only : but that vivid effect, arising from the binocular vision of near objects, is not per- ceived by the former, who, to supply the deficiency, resorts to other means of acquiring more accurate information ; and of these the motion of the head is the principal. Mr. VVheatstone has also shown that, if similar images, differing only in magnitude, are presented to analogous parts of the reduce, the resultant idea is that of an image appa- rently intermediate in size between them.* Foucault and I. Regnault have employed the stereoscope to determine whether com- plementary retinal images produce the im- pression of white on corresponding points of both eyes. Two complementary rays, ob- tained by chromatic polarisation, were thrown in a horizontal direction on the mirrors of a stereoscope, and reflected from them on the screens attached at the sides, so that two small disks of paper were coloured by them. At first one or other complementary colour was alternately seen : after a time, however, the two impressions united to form white ; and when the eyes had once become accus- tomed to this, a whole series of complemen- tary colours could be introduced successively, and nothing but white was seen during the entire experiment. From the following interesting experiments by Sir David Brewster, it appears that we give solidity and relief to plane figures by a suitable application of colour to parts that are placed at different distances from the eye. If we look with both eyes through a lens about two and a half inches in diameter, at an ob- ject having colours of different refrangibilities, as a red "rose among green leaves, the two colours will appear at different distances from the eye of the observer. In this experiment we are looking through the margin of two semi-lenses, orvirtual prisms, by which the more refrangible ra3 s are more refracted than the less refrangible rays. The doubly coloured object is thus divided into two, as it were, and the distance between the two blue por- tions is as much greater than the distance between the two red portions (red and blue being supposed to be the colours) as twice * Sir David Brewster disputes this and several other deductions of Mr. Wheatstone, in an able paper, " On the Law of Visible Position in Single and Binocular Vision," Transactions of the Royal So- ciety of Edinburgh, vol. xv. the deviation produced by the virtual prism, if we use a large lens or two semi-lenses, or by the real prisms if we use prisms. The images of different colours being thus sepa- rated, the eyes unite them, as in the stereo- scope, and the red image takes its place nearer the observer than the blue, in the same manner as the two nearest portions of the dis- similar stereoscopic figures stand up in relief at a distance from their more remote por- tions. The reverse of this will take place, if a concave lens be used, or if the refracting angles of the two prisms be turned inwards. The modified stereoscope has very recently been applied to photographic purposes with the happiest results. Adaptation to distance. — On no subject connected with the physioloey of the eye has there been a greater diversity of opinion than on the mode in which adjustment to distance is performed. That such adjustment is necessary, is proved by the simple experiment of looking between the fingers held about eight inches from the eye, at a distant object. When the distant object is seen distinctly, the fingers will be seen indistinctly; and if we look at the fingers so as to see them quite distinctly, the distant object will be indis- tinct. Our space will not admit of our doing more than glancing rapidly at the theories which have been advanced, and eagerly sup- ported, to account for this alteration in the focus of the eye. By Bayle, Itohault, Home, Olbers, and Schroeder Vanderkolk, alteration in the form of the eye by means of the ex- ternal muscles was supposed to be the medium of adjustment. The movements of the iris have had their supporters, of whom the prin- cipal were Mile and Pouillet. Ramsden and Sir Everard Home regarded a change in the convexity of the cornea as the medium of adjustment. By John Hunter and Dr. Young (who devoted much time to the inquiry), elongation and shortening of the axis of the lens, through a contractile power inherent in the lens itself, were supposed to be the cause; and lastly, it was referred by many authori- ties, including Kepler, Scheiner, Camper, and Porterfield, to the movement of the lens by means of the ciliary processes. Porterfield was probably the first who hit upon the true explanation, by referring the adjustment to the action of the ciliary body upon the crys- talline, and by distinctly asserting the mus- cularity of the ciliary body. In reply to the arguments of De la Hire (who maintained that at whatever distance objects were placed, the eyes never altered their focus), Porter- field acutely observes : " This author main- tains that it is impossible the crystalline can change its situation, because the ciliary liga- ment is not muscular, and consequently has no power of contraction : and of this opinion are likewise a great many anatomists, and in particular Hovius : but it appears that all of them have been led into this mistake by an unjust no;ion they have entertained about the colour of muscles. Every body knows that our muscles are generally of a red colour; butVISION. Hoi it does not from tlicnce follow that what is not red is not niusculous. The muscular fibres of the guts and stomach have scarce anything of redness in their colour ; and it is also certain that the pupil does contract and dilate itself according as objects are more or less lumi- nous, and yet noneof the fibres which perform that action are in the least red. Whence it follows that the fibres of the ligamentum ciliare are not to be deprived of a power of con- traction because of a colour different from what generally obtains in other muscles ; nor are we to be surprised that so many accurate anatomists, after a careful examination of this process, have not scrupled to affirm it to be truly muscular." Mons. Pouillet has advanced the hypothesis that, by the peculiar conformation of the lens, near objects are seen through the medium of the rays passing through its centre, and distant objects by means of the circumferential rays, lie describes the crystalline lens as made up of strata, differing in curvature and density, so that its section exhibits a series of concen- trical ellipses having varying excentricities, the internal strata being more curved anil more dense than the external; whence the rays which pass from the latter converge to a more distant point than those from the former. According to this theory, the crystalline lens has many different foci,and the effect should be, that when a pencil of rays falls upon it, those rays which are near the axis of the pencil, and therefore near the centre of the lens, are brought to a shorter focus than those which are near the border ; whence near objects would, says M. Pouillet, be seen by means of the central rays, and distant objects by means of those rays which fall near the borders of the crystalline lens. It has been observed that De la Hire de- nied that there is an alteration in the focus, whether we look at a near or distant object. He regarded the whole adjustment as a simple enlargement and diminution of the pupil. At first sight this may appear absurd, but there are facts which give some colour to his theory. That a change in the size of the pupil has a considerable influence upon the distinctness of objects at different distances, is known, and if the eye be turned to a near object, as a book, after it has been gazing at a distant ship, the illumination of both being equal, the pupil is observed to contract. Dr. Mackenzie says, it is an error not unfre- quently adopted, that if the rays which pass into the eye from a distant object, and those from a near object, have the same divergence, a circumstance which may depend on a mere change in the sue of the pupil, they will be collected on the same point of the retina without any change in the refractive media of the eye. That this cannot be the case, is evi- dent from the fact that the rays from a dis- tant object, and those from a near object, although they may have the same divergence, fall on the cornea at different angles of inci- dence, and must necessarily meet the axis of the eye at different points alter refraction. Now the whole effect of the alteration in the size of the pupil is, as explained elsewhere, to increase the distinctness of objects by cutting off those rays which would cause cir- cles of dispersion on the retina. On the one hand, an enlargement of the pupil gives dis- tinctness to distant objects, by allowing a greater quantity of light to enter the eye, and on the other, its contraction assists in render- ing near objects distinct by cutting off the lateral rays which are not duly refracted, and would cause confusion of the image on the retina. If, however, a proof were required to show that something more than a mere alter- ation in the form of the pupil is necessary to the perfection of vision at all distances, it would be afforded by the change termed pres- byopia. The eye, in w hat may be called its state of perfect indolent vision, is adapted only to see distant objects, the adjustment to the near focus requiring an effort : the power to make the effort in question is partially or entirely lost by the presbyopic eye, yet the pupil may act as vigorously as ever. Though it is not unusual to find a degree of sluggish- ness in the actions of the pupil in elderly persons, yet we have repeatedly seen instances in which the iris acted with great vigour, and where a book was obliged to be held at arm's length for the type to be distinctly seen. Wagner and Dr. Clay Wallace of New York follow Porterfield in attributing the ad- justment to the action of the corpus ciliare; the latter considering that, " by the graduat- ing power of the ciliary processes and ciliary muscles, together with the elasticity of the membranes of the vitreous bod)1, the crystalline may be drawn not only backwards and for- wards, but its inclination may be changed so as to throw the image on another part of the re- retina :" and the modus operandi he explains by supposing " the outer ciliary muscle to contract the vessels returning from the ciliary pro- cesses ; the ciliary processes which are at- tached by the filaments of Amnion to the ciliary zone and crystalline capsule, to become erect and to draw forward the crystalline body ; and the inner ciliary muscle, aided by the elasticity of the membranes of the vitreous humour, to draw it backwards." The opinion, however, which appears most satisfactory, is that advanced by Mr. Bow- man, who has clearly proved the muscular nature of the ciliary body. " It has (sa}s he) the arrangement of a muscle, very much the structure of a muscle, and is largely sup- plied with nerves, which are in great part derived from a motor source — the third pair. This muscle arises, or has its most fixed attachment, at the junction of the scle- rotica and cornea, as much in front of the lens as is possible, consistently with the preserva- tion of the transparency of the cornea. That it may act more freely, a canal, the circular sinus, is interposed between its origin and the portion of the sclerotica which it lies against. Beyond this point it is hardly at all attached to the sclerotica, over which its fibres may be supposed to move in contraction ; but it1452 VISION. covers, and is inserted into, the anterior one- eighth of an inch of the choroid membrane, which is in this part tougher and firmer than elsewhere, and united in a very special manner to the lens by the ciliary processes, through the medium of a firm tough membrane, and of a strong elastic fibrous membrane proceed- in" from it to the margin of the lens, and yet not quite to its margin, for an elegant arrange- ment exists, the canal of Petit, by which traction is made, not on the vitreous around the lens, nor on the edge of the lens itself, so much as on its anterior surface. I confess it seems to me very difficult to doubt that this complicated system of parts is intended to advance the lens towards the cornea, so as to bring forward, up to the retina, the focus of a near object, which would otherwise fall be- hind the nervous sheet. It is possible also, I think, from the peculiar direction taken by the ciliary muscle, that it may compress the front of the vitreous, and thus help to throw for- ward the lens." * An ingenious theory has been suggested by Sturm, and supported by Matteuci, founded on the results of Chossat's measurement of the eye of an ox, to the effect that in place of comparing the optical apparatus of the eye to a system of spherical lenses whose axes are blended, we ought to consider the organ as composed of several refracting media, sepa- rated by surfaces which are neither exactly spherical, nor even of revolution or symme- trical about a common axis. Reasoning from this, he argues that a peculiar refraction of the rays of light takes place, whereby Me retina is placed in what he terms a focal in- terval, which focal interval will change its position according as the external luminous point recedes from, or approaches to, the eye and that the retina will be always met by the concentrated fasciculus around the axis in the focal interval ; the surface of intersection of this fasciculus and of the retina being very slightly modified, in order that the impression may not be sensibly altered, or the perception rendered indistinct. This theory is, however, decidedly open to objection, and is rendered unnecessary by that of Mr. Bowman. Magnifying lens. — It has been already stated that the apparent magnitude of an ob- ject depends upon that of the angle of vision under which it is seen, and this increases in proportion as the object is brought nearer to the eye ; but the magnitude of the angle of vision being limited, we are obliged to resort to artificial means to enlarge it further than, in its natural condition, is admitted of. The pin-hole aperture affords some assistance, but the convex lens more. The following is the mode in which it acts : — Let CD be a convex lens, and ab an object lying within the focal length of the glass, then all the rays passing from a point of the object ab will diverge after their passage through the lens, exactly as if they came from the corresponding point of the image ab ; an eye * Lectures on the Parts concerned in the Opera- tions on the Eye, p. 60. Fig. 889. a behind the lens would be able to see the ob- ject distinctly through the lens if the image ab were at the distance of distinct vision. In this case, however, the object being much nearer the eye, it could not be seen without the lens. The magnifying power of the lens therefore depends essentially on the means it gives us of bringing the object very near the eye, and thus increasing the angle of vision. Abnormal Vision. In the consideration of abnormal vision, we propose to divide the subject into 1. Abnormal Vision resulting from defec- tive action of the retina or sensorium ; as Achromatopsy, Hypcrchromatopsy, and Anorthopia. 2. Abnormal Vision arising from faulty con- figuration of the eye, or from changes in the refractive media ; as Myopia, Pres- byopia, and Cylindrical Eye. Amaurosis, Chrupsia, and other morbid conditions, do not fall within the scope of this article. Achromatopsy (a not, xp^f-a colour, &ty the eye), or insensibility of the eye to colours, is an affection which has been recognised nearly two hundred years ; but, although cases have been from time to time published in the Phi- losophical Transactions and oilier scientific works, our knowledge of the phenomena of this singular condition is of recent date, and is chiefly due to the labours of Wartmann, Seebeck, Szokalski, Purkinje, Himly, &c. Various names have been proposed for this imperfection of vision ; but the majority are exceedingly unmanageable. By Sommer and Szokalski the term chromato-pseudopsis has been employed ; Goethe proposed to call it akyano-blepsis, whilst Purkinje divided the disorder into four varieties,—achromatopsis, chromato-dysopsvi, akyano-blepsis, and anery- thro-blepsis; others again have been satisfied with the simple term chromato-metablepsis. Jiingken employs indifferently the denomina- tions of achromatopsy, chromatopseudopsy, and ehromatometablcpsy. Many writers, however, have adopted the term Daltonism, proposed by Prevost, and supported by Wartmann ; and, although objectionable as perpetuating the in- firmity of an individual, it has the merit of simplicity and easy inflection. The term achromatopsy is, perhaps, that most usually employed, although, strictly speaking, it is only applicable to one class. Still, being ex- tensively recognised, we shall adopt it to de- signate this imperfection of vision ; occasion-14.53 VISION. ally the expression "Daltonian" may be used for the sake of brevity. Modifications of insensibility to colours exist in every degree, and in the minor shades are so frequent as to be almost proverbial with reference to the male sex ; indeed, if twelve men, taken at random, were shown a numner of ribands of the more delicate colours, a diversity of opinion would almost certainly arise as to the appropriate names. The number of persons who cannot distinguish certain colours is considerable; but the defect is seldom known to others, those who are con- scious of their imperfection being desirous of concealing it, and some perhaps, not being aware of it till accident leads to its discovery. In every case that has fallen under our notice, there has been reluctance to submit to ex- amination, from the fear of ridicule; and indeed it is difficult to repress a smile when a person is seen to match green and scarlet to- gether, or crimson and dark blue, and earnestly protest that the colours are absolutely iden- tical. The nearest approach to this condition in the healthy eye, and a test by which the embarrasment of Daltonians may be judged of, is the difficulty of distinguishing between blue and green by candlelight; a difficulty which every one must have experienced. Analogous to this defect of the organ of vision, is that better known, because more evident, insensi- bility of the organ of hearing, whereby many persons are utterly unable to detect the differ- ences between musical notes, or, as pointed out by Dr.Wollaston, their ears maybe abso- lutely insensible to sounds at one extremity of the scale. Sir David Brewster remarks* that, although his own hearing is perfect and each ear equally acute for all ordinary sounds, yet one of them is absolutely deaf to the chirp of the cricket, while the other hears it distinctly. Dr. Pliny Earle has published t a remarkable illustration of the imperfection of the two senses in conjunction. " The whole family (says he) of which the chart has been ex- hibited, is probably no less generally charac- terised by a defective musical ear than an imperfect appreciation of colours. Several of the individuals comprised in it are utterly inca- pable of distinguishing one tune from another. * * A gentleman who has the general delect under discussion, and whose case is included in the thirty-one herein mentioned, is a well- known professor in one of the Metropolitan Medical Schools of the United States. In him the total inability to discriminate between musical sounds is coexistent with the defec- tive perception of colour * * Another of the gentlemen whose case of defective per- ception of colours is herein noticed, is gene- rally acknowledged as one of the first and greatest of American poets now living. He also is unable to distinguish one tune from another; yet his poetry is not deficient in the requisites of perfect cadence, harmony, and rhythm." * Philosoph. Mag. vol. xxv. p. 13G. + American Journal of Medical Sciences, vol. 35. p. 347. It has been remarked by Warfmann as a curious fact, that in no ancient author is there any passage which can be referred to the subject of achromatopsy, and that the nume- rous travellers who have traversed the old and new world are equally silent in this respect. As to the relative frequency of achroma- topsy, Seebeck states that five out of forty youths w ho composed the two upper classes in a gymnasium at Berlin, were affected with it, and Prevost has declared that the pro- portion of this imperfect vision to perfect vision, is as one to twenty. It is true that Chelius and Chevreul entertain a very op- posite opinion, but the balance of authority is decidedly against them. This affection is often hereditary, and is found in some families to a remarkable extent. It sometimes occurs in successive generations, of which a remarkable instance has been pub- lished by M. Cunier*, and at other times it ap- pears in alternate generations, descending far more frequently on the maternal side than the paternal. In the case of Mr. Milne, recorded by Dr. Combef, the maternal grandfather was affected w ith Daltonism, also his two brothers and a second cousin. In that of a child related by Dr. NichollJ the maternal grandfather and several of his brothers were similarly affected ; such was also the case with two young men mentioned by Dr. Cornaz.§ They were the offspring of the same mother but by different fathers, and in both, achromatopsy existed to a marked degree. But the most striking illustration of the hereditary character of this defect has been recorded by Dr. Pliny Earle ||, and it is so remarkable that we give it in his own words. " My maternal grandfather and two of his brothers were characterised by it, and among the descendants of the first mentioned, there are seventeen persons in whom it is found. I have not been able to extend my inquiries among the collateral branches of the family, but have heard of one individual, a female, in one of them, who was similarly affected.* * * Nothing is known of the first generation (of five) in regard to the power of perception of colours. In the second, of a family consisting of seven brothers and eight sisters, three of the brothers, one of whom, as before mentioned, was the grandfather of the writer, had the defect in question. In the third generation, consisting of the children of the grandfather aforesaid, of three brothers and four sisteis, there was no one whose ability to distinguish colours was imperfect. In the fourth genera- tion, the first family includes five brothers and four si-.ters, of whom two of the former have the defect. In the second family there was but one child, whose vision was normal. In the third there were seven brothers, of whom four had the defect. In the fifth, seven sistei s and three brothers, of a!l of whom the * Annates d'Oculistique, torn. i. p. 417. t Transactions of Phrenological Society, p. 222 t Med. Chir. Trans, vol. vii. p. 477. § Annales d'Oculistique, toni. xxiii. p. 43. || Op. cit. p. 349.VISION. 14-54- vision is perfect in regard to colour. In the sixth, four brothers and five sisters, of whom two of each' sex have the defect. In the seventh, two brothers and three sisters, both of the former having the defect. In the eighth, there was no issue, and in the ninth there a e two sisters, both of them capable of appreciating colours." Of the fifth genera- tion "the defective perception has hitherto been detected in but two of the families. In one of them, consisting of three brothers and three sisters, one of the brothers has the defect, and in the other, a male, an only child, is similarly affected." Sex exercises a considerable influence on the occurrence of achromatopsy; of the thirty-one cases mentioned by Dr. Earle. twenty-seven were males and four females, and the result of upwards of two hundred cases shows that as a general rule the propor- tion of males is nine tenths of the whole. A very remarkable instance has however been published by M. Currier*, where achroma- topsy occurred in five generations of one family, there being thirteen cases, and all females ; but this stands alone as a notable exception to the general rule. If it be true that the works of the needle are the means of perfecting a delicacy in the judgment of tints, and in women the organ of colour is more developed than in men (as asserted by Gall), these very works ought to lead daily to the detection of achromatopsy if it existed ; and we may reasonably conclude that as cases are not discovered they do not exist. According to the observations of Szokalski, this defect of vision especially obtains among nations having a Germanic origin, as the Germans, English, Swiss and Belgians; the French, Italians, and Spaniards being com- paratively free : it seems to be common in the United Slates, but this does not militate against the proposition, the Americans being descendants of the old British stock. How far this peculiarity may be attributable to the greater sensibility of the inhabitants of southern climes, where the more brilliant sun- shine develops colours in a degree unknown in the northern latitudes, is a question which cannot be decided in the present state of our knowledge: nor can we affirm with con- fidence, as stated by the same writer, that achromatopsy occurs most frequently in ro- bust constitutions, combined with a bilious and melancholic temperament. A difference of opinion exists as to whether achromatopsy is indicated by any visible signs ; Szokalski, Ruete, and Himly affirm that there is no diagnostic mark, and llau considers that a yellowish tinge of the iris, which has been considered by some to be indicative of it, is far too common to be so regarded. Professor VVartmann has in his first memoir drawn attention to a peculiar golden lustre of the eyes, which presents itself in cases of achro- matopsy, where the iris is hazel. Miss Sedg- wick f says of the historian Sismondi, that he * Op. cit. t Letters from Abroad, vol i. p. ?50. had brilliant hazel eyes : lie was a Daltonian. At least five other cases are known to have presented the same peculiarity, but the num- ber is yet too small to admit of this being regarded otherwise than as a coincidence, for in truth there appears to be as many Dalto- nians with blue, black, and grey eyes, as with hazel, and as many eyes without a yellow pupillary margin as with it. There is sufficient evidence before us to warrant our considering achromatopsy under two distinct forms: congenital and non-con- genital. The former is always persistent: the latter may be divided into permanent and tem- porary. Writers have classified the defect according to degree; but the simplest and most practical arrangement is that of Wartmann, who recog- nises two classes only: the Dichromatic and the Poh/chromatic. This we think advantageous, as avoiding unnecessary sub-classification, the varieties of the defect being endless. Congenital Achromatopsy. — This form is most common, and the majority of recorded cases of insensibility of the eye to colour are examples of it. It presents the best marked illustrations of both varieties, which we shall proceed to consider. Class I. (Dichromatic Daltonism of Wart- mann).— Black, white, and the intermediate shades of grey are the only tints recognized by patients of this class. Such persons dis- tinguish with facility the forms of objects and the gradations of light and shade, but to them all the charms of nature and of art, as ex- pressed by colour, are unknown ; their retina? are rather sensitive than otherwise, and they not only see objects at a great distance, but can read with facility in an obscurity amount- ing to darkness. The first of these cases on record was pub- lished by Dr. Dawbeny Tubervile, an oculist of Salisbury,* being that of a young woman who consulted him about her sight, which, though excellent in every other respect, incapacitated her from distinguishing any other hues than black and white ; it is especially mentioned that she could read " for nearly a quarter of an hour in the greatest darkness." The next, best marked case has been recorded by M. D. Hombres Firmas.f M. , of Anduze, of a bilious and melancholic temperament,but lead- ing a very active life, had arrived at an ad- vanced age without its being known, except to a very few individuals, that there was any- thing uncommon in his sight; but all colours appeared to him as tints of grey, between black and white. Like several others having this infirmity, he was fond of painting, and had painted in his apartment two friezes and a pannel between the windows: of these he was proud; but some of his visitors inquired why he had represented the ground, the trees, houses, and persons all blue? He replied that he wished them to match the furniture, he * Phil. Trans. No. 164. p. 736. and Lowthorp's Abridgement, vol. iii. part i. p. 40. f Ann. d'Oculistique, torn. xxii. p. 72.1455 VISION. being quite unconscious that this was red. He had a collection of engravings, some coloured and others plain, but the only dif- ference he could perceive was, that some were clearer than others. When criticising a picture he would discuss the composition of the design, the light, shade, and perspective ; but, as to the colours, he was silent. When walking with others in a garden, he affected to speak of the beauty and size of the flowers, their regularity and perfume, but to his eyes they, like the pictures, were all grey. The case of a shoemaker named Harris, described in the Philosophical Transactions,* has been ge- nerally quoted as a well-marked example of this form of achromatopsy, but on carefully considering the remarks made upon it by Dr. Dalton f, we are doubtful whether it really was as supposed, and are inclined rather to refer it to the second class. The case of M. Collardeau J has been described as of this nature. This gentleman was an amateur artist, but the imperfection of his vision gave rise to the strangest pro- ductions. So long as he confined himself to the pencil, or to sketching in one colour, he designed with much skill, but his paintings in colours were the reverse of happy. For in- stance, wishing to work up a scene in which he had drawn a dog, he unfortunately mistook the colour, and painted red all those parts which should have been deep blue. He has been known to confound on the canvass yel- low with blue, and red with green, regarding his work with the complaisance of a man who felt that he had achieved success. The following interesting cases are of a character forming a connecting link between the two classes of achromatopsy. The first is related by D'Hombres Firmas. § Count of Alais, aged thirty -eight, married, and the father of a family, possessed excellent vision in every repect, except the perception of colours ; but yellow, and the shades be- tween black and white, were the only tints he could recognise. On a number of dif- ferent roses being placed in his hands, he merely saw that white flowers were brighter than purple; yellow flowers he distinguished, but red, blue, violet, and v\hite blossoms all appeared more or less dark though he dis- tinguished the yellow centres. This gen- tleman was fond of geology, but found it im- possible to judge of the colours whic h marked various formations in the map of M. Dumas. Lacustrine formations and the lias were the only ones which he distinguished, all the others appearing to him tinted in grey; and he would have confounded them together, if his excellent sight had not enabled him to follow the dotted lines and letters by which they were indicated. He drew with taste in crayon, Indian ink, and sepia ; but only on * Phil. Trans, vol. Ixvii. p. 260. f Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical So- ciety of Manchester, vol. v. part i. p. 38. J Observations sur la Physique et l'Histoire Na- turelle, vol. xiii. p. 87. § Op. cit. p. 73. one occasion attempted a scene in colours, of a peasant and a bouquet of flowers. The re- sult was so very unsatisfactory to ordinary eyes, that he was not tempted to repeat the experiment. The second case has been recorded by Dr. Deconde.* A soldier applying for his discharge on the ground of the formation of cataract, attracted particular attention on account of the cyanic colour of his sclerotica ; and on investigating his power of distinguishing co- lours, it was found that all those of the spec- trum were confounded in two fundamental hues, yellow and blue. Dark red, bright red, rose, orange, yellow, green in which yel- low predominated, and grey white, all ap- peared as different shades of yellow : whilst blue, green, and white with a blueish shade, were perceived as blue. All the very deep colours were regarded as black, and all the very light ones had a whitish appearance, though the man did not seem to have cogni- zance of white, properly so called. Light, de- composed by a prism, appeared to him of uni- form blue. His sight was feeble and easily fatigued. Numerous trials always led to the above results. Class II. (Polychromatic Daltonism of Wartmann.)—This form includes the vast ma- jority of cases of insensibility to colours, and presents a very remarkable diversity of phe- nomena. The colour, which, of all others, is the stumbling-block, is lilac, and next to it rose, indigo, and violet; on the othei hand, yellow and blue are most commonly recog- nised. A very general form is that first de- scribed by the illustrious Dalton "f, who has given his name to the affection; and the following are the chief features of his case. He was not conscious of any peculiarity of vision until the age of twenty-six, when, a dis- cussion arising as to the colour of the flower of Geranium zonale, it was discovered that he and his brother differed materially from other people in their ideas upon the point. About two years afterwards he entered upon an in- vestigation of the subject, anil the following are the principal results at which he arrived. The solar spectrum appeared composed of three colours, yellow, blue, and purple, the red being little more than a shade or defect of light. Orange, yellow, and green were shades of yellow, w hilst green and blue were strongly contrasted. Of ordinary colours, crimson and dark blue were identical; the colour of a florid complexion being a dull opaque blackish blue, upon a white ground ; blood seemed bottle green ; the face of a laurel leaf was a good match for a stick of sealing wax ; and the back of the leaf an- swered to the lighter red of wafers. Green baize appeared a dark brownish red : and a light drab was not to be distinguished from a light green ; browns were very diversified, some having a great affinity for green, others * Annates d'Ocnlistique, torn. xx. p. 52. f Mem. of the Lit. and Phil. Society of Man- chester, vol. v. part i.14j0 VISION. for red; pink appeared sky blue by daylight, but assumed an orange or yellowish appear- ance by candle light. Dalton believed that the peculiarity in his vision was caused by the vitreous humour of his eyes having a blue tint : to this point reference will hereafter be made. According to Professor Wartmann, the following are the most common confusions of colour, ranged in order of their frequency : — 1. Deep red with deep blue. Indigo with violet. Deep blue with violet. Bright orange with bright yellow. 5. Deep brown with deep green. Dark blue with indigo. Bright brown with bright green. Dark red with dark green. Rose with bright blue. 10. Dark orange with dark yellow. Bright red with bright green. Deep yellow with dark green. Dark brown with black. Bright red with bright blue. 15. Bright yellow with bright green. Bright red with bright yellow. Dark red with black. Dark red with dark brown. Dark green with violet. 20. Dark red with dark yellow. Dark red with violet. Bright yellow with bright brown. Bright blue with violet. 25. Dark red with dark grey. Dark red with indigo. Rose with violet. Dark blue with dark grey. Dark green with indigo. 30. Rose with dark blue. Rose with indigo. Dark green with dark grey. Bright orange with bright green. White with taint green. Putting aside the differences in the bril- liancy of the tints, it is found that the follow- ing numbers express how many times each of those tints is proportionally seen without error. Red - - 37 Blue - - 100 Orange - - 12 Indigo - - 0 Yellow - - 100 Violet - - 0 Green - - 59 Wartmann has given* a very interesting account of his experiments on the vision of Louis D . This individual did not per- ceive any great difference between the colour of the leaf and that of the ripe fruit of the cherry ; he confounded that of a sea-green paper with the scarlet of a riband placed close to it. The flower of the rose seemed to him greenish blue, and he called the ash colour of quick lime light green. The appearances presented by a solar spectrum were as follows, — the coloured bands, brilliant and distinct, extended a length of about O102'. D ■ perceived four colours only, blue, green, yel- low and red. He limited the blue part exactly to the space occupied by the violet, indigo and blue : he called the green and yellow bands, less an interval of O002' towards the orange, green ; he called that band of 0'002', and a fraction of the red 0-012' in breadth, yellow; * Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, vol. iv. p. 173. lastly, the remaining 0 008' of red appeared to him of a red difficult to define. By refracted light the results were nearly the same, thirty- seven plates of glass exhibiting only four different colours in various intensities. When examined by polarized light, it seems that on the one hand he did not appreciate the equality of intensity of two complementary colours as did ordinary vision ; but he found a total and abrupt difference when colours passed at once from the finest red to very rich deep blue, a distinction far from being marked to others. His visual organ was unable to perceive the different mixtures of red which accompany blue to make it pass into purplish violet. This precise circumscription of the consti- tutive domain of a colour is a fact which, in the opinion of Professor Wartmaun, was new and worthy of being remarked. Whilst a series of these experiments with polarised light were going on, the sun, which had been obscured, suddenly shone out, and D declared that the colours imme- diately assumed a different tint to his sight, all reddening in a sensible manner, so that he called red that which he had before named green and ill-defined blue, whereas the Pro- fessor saw no other change in the colours than an increaseof their brilliancy and strength. Wartmann then submitted the patient to experiments to ascertain his perception ol the complementary colours, and the result showed that although his eyes were not insensible to them, the colours which appeared to him complementary were not the same as those so regarded by the normal eye. The Professor then painted a human head, giving to each part a complementary colour. Thus the hair and eyebrows were white, the flesh brownish, the sclerotica black, the lips and cheeks green. When asked what he thought of the head, D replied that it appeared to him na- tural, that the hair was covered with a white cap little marked, and that the carnation of the cheeks was that of a person heated by a long walk. There are a certain number of cases of in- sensibility to colours which have been quoted by all writers on the subject. We shall there- fore content ourselves with merely referring to them*, describing a few well marked and uncommon instances less generally known. Dr. Boys de Loury f has published the particulars of a M. H , who was obliged, on account of his detective sight, to aban- don the profession of a dyer. His principal colour was yellow. The brilliant yellow of the apricot and deep brown of the chesnut were only distinguished as varieties of shade. All dark hues were called black; scarlet ap- * Cases of achromatopsy are detailed as follows: — Phil. Trans, vol. lxvii. p. 200, vol. lxviii. p. 611; Edinb. Phil.

There was no un- usual appearance in his eyes, but he saw most perfectly in the evening. Dr. Sommer* has described his own case thus. Blue can always be distinguished from yellow, bright blue from green, and deep red from black, but green and dark blue are often confounded. Yellow, black, and de- cided blue are the fundamental colours. If he holds a leaf of a tree and a stick of red sealing-wax side by side he recognises dis- tinctly the difference in intensity between the two colours, but cannot affirm which is preen or which red : rather decided blue and rather intense red bear a great re- semblance; blue is confounded with red, green with brown, brown and orange with bright brown. As to crimson, lilac, purple and deep scarlet, they are colours of which he cannot form even an idea. He one day met a lady wearing a blue bonnet ornamented with red roses, but could scarcely distin- guish any difference between the two. On another occasion when walking out it began to rain. " Then (says he) a crowd of red um- brellas displayed themselves, and I compared the colour to the azure of the sky." The rainbow appeared to him composed of blue and yellow ; he knew that there were shades, but could not satisfactorily discern them. The case of the late Mr. Troughton was examined by Sir John Herschell and Sir D. Brewster, and it was ascertained that he saw the red space yellow; hence according to the views of Sir D. Brewster, he saw a space con- taining much yellow, and little blue, the red light being as it were absorbed in consequence of the retina being insensible to its action. Sir D. Brewster goes on to say "jr. " If this be the case there must have been a diminution of light in the red space seen by Mr. Troughton, ami I am persuaded from the experiments I made upon his eyes that this was the case ; but whe- ther it was to the extent of the total defalcation of the red rays, I will not venture to assert. But it is not necessary that it should be so ; the defective perception of red light may be accompanied with a more acute perception of the other colours, in a manner analogous to what takes place in the chemical spectrum, where the removal of the red rays produces an increased action of the rays that are left." Sir D. Brewster, adds that he has long been of opinion that the retina receives a more powerful luminous impression from yellow light than from the pure white light of which this yellow forms but a part. Persons affected with achromatopsy not only see well in deep gloom, but their vision of distant objects is particularly sharp, from the azure blue of the atmosphere presenting the strongest possible contrast to black. One intelligent person says J, "So much is this the * Graefe unci Walthers, Journal fur Chirurgie, Bd. v. Heft i. S. 135. t Phil. Mag. vol. xxv. p. 139. j Glasgow Medical Journal, vol. ii. p. 12.

Daltonians endeavour to obviate the an- noyances arising from their infirmity by taking some standard colours or shades as [mints of comparison, as for instance the green of grass ; they also bring the sense of touch to their assistance, and are enabled by these means, united with close attention, to avoid many errors ; but nevertheless they feel repugnance to express an opinion upon colours Non-congciiilalAchromatopsy.—This though quite distinct from Chrup&ia, is generally a morbid symptom, and might easily be con- founded with it. It is to be borne in mind that in certain cases of chrupsia objects ap- pear tinged with colours foreign to them ; a general officer for instance saw all white objects of a deep orange colour at certain times of the day, and to a lady they appeared of a bright blue*; but in such cases all objects are tinged with a prevailing tint or it is confined to those which are white, coloured objects being properly recognised. In achromatopsy one or more colours are efTaced, and the individual is no longer cog- nizant of them. Permanent Achromatopsy. — A bootmaker in Paris f, was attacked with amaurotic amblyopia, which followed suppression of the cutaneous exhalation. It was accompanied with rheumatic pains, and there was at first irritation of the retina, but this subsided, leaving the si»ht imperfect. The patient, howe\er, assured M. Szokalski that he had possessed a full perception of colours until after a copious bleeding from the arm. From that time he could only discern white, black, and grey, and could not distinguish an engrav- ing from a coloured print. He one day bought a piece of yellow morocco leather by mistake for a white piece, and when examined by M. Szokalski, he could not distinguish any co- loured patterns which were exhibited to him. Dr. Mackenzie thus writes ; " I always con- sidered this affection as a congenital one, till I was consulted by a man who had gradually become subject to it. He was by trade an ornamental painter, and could judge at one time perfectly of colours. His right eye was affected with mydriasis when he called upon me, and there was incomplete amaurosis of both eyes, so that he could no longer read a common type. On trying him I found he mistook red and green. The use of spirits and tobacco was probably the cause of the affection of sight in this individual.''^ * Collections from the unpublished medical writ- ings of C. H.

M. Louis D was the eldest of seven brothers and four sisters, who were assorted in a very singular category. The first set had red hair, and their vision was perfect ; the others had fair hair, and all were unable to distinguish colours. Louis D belonged to the latter, as regards external appearances, but according to his own recollection, and the evidence of his mother, he perceived colours during his infancy, in the usual manner. At the age of nine years his skull was fractured, after which bis perception of colours appears to have become defective. The fact however of his brothers, who resembled him in ap- pearance, being similarly affected from birth, weakens the chain of evidence on this point. His infirmity was for some time unknown, and his father endeavoured, by repeated cor- poral punishment, to put a stop to what he called a perverse pretence, and a severe cor- rection was administered by his master, a bookbinder, because he used red paper, in- stead of green, for the covers of some books. Temporary Achromatopsy. — This form ap- pears to us not to have received the attention it merits, having been passed over in silence, or only cursorily alluded to, by the great majority of writers. The exciting causes are congestion, hepatic derangement, and dys- pepsia, and it may exist in conjunction with more or less amaurosis, or by itself, as a simple derangement of vision. The first case we shall relate is highly in- teresting from the marked maniter in which the insensibility to colours existed, its dura- tion and satisfactory disappearance as restora- tion to health proceeded. It occurred in the practice of that very able physician, Dr. Ilays.-)- Mary Bishop, aelat. twenty, was admitted into the Wills Hospital, Feb. 9, 1639. She was of short, robust stature, full habit, very dark complexion, black hair, and hazel h ides, flushed face, colour of her cheeks at times almost of a purplish hue; catamenia sup- pressed. In 1837 and 1838 she had suffered from two attacks of cerebral disease ; after the first attack, objects appeared double. The second attack left her entirely blind, in which condition she continued for four months. After this her sight began to return, and at the period of her admission into the hospital, she could read large print. When she came under the notice of Dr. Hays, in May, 1839, she had been largely depleted, and had taken remedies for the restoration of the catamenia, under which treatment her sight had im- proved. At this time it was discovered that she was unable to distinguish colours, yellow and blue being the only ones she could name with certainty. Nearly all others she termed brown, or hesitated to name, designating how- * Op. cit. t American Jouvn. of Medical Sciences, vol. xxvi. p. --'77. ever their shades; or intensity of colour accu- rately. Thus she called a deep red, dark brown; a bright green, light brown; and very pale pink, very light shade of brown. The patient was not sensible at first that she laboured under any particular defect in distinguishing colours. She had noticed, that grass and roses did not appear as formerly, and she remembered that as her sight began to re- turn, the first colour she perceived was yel- low. The usual treatment for amenorrhea was adopted, and on the 29th of May the catamenia returned copiously, but continued only for a single day. It was followed, however, by a very marked improvement in vision. Roses now appeared to her of their natural colour, and she could distinguish the difference be- tween the colour of the rose and that of the leaves, which she had not previously been able to do. By the middle of June she was able to see the eye of a needle and the end of a thread, but could not thread the needle from inability to see both at the same time. At this period she was again examined with the prismatic spectrum, and distinguished pretty accurately the yellow, blue, green, and red, but was doubtful as to the orange. On the 30th of November it is stated that her sii^ht was good, notwithstanding another attack of congestion and suppression of the menses. She distinguished all the primitive colours readily, and named most of the secondary ones as correctly as could be expected, with the exception of violet, which she was at a loss to name. A gentleman, aged 3G, librarian to one of our medical colleges, has communicated to me the particulars of his own case in the follow- ing words : " A few years ago I noticed that on getting out of bed, and looking at a new carpet which had been laid down but a short time, I was unable to distinguish the colours, though I could clearly make out the pattern, which appeared simply black and white. I felt rather alarmed, and asked my wife if it was the same carpet. She assured me it was, and inquired my reason for putting the ques- tion. On telling her, she at once suspected I had taken some bad wine at a public dinner I had attended over-night. I may add that I have invariably experienced the same effects after dining out, more especially if I take more than one kind of wine ; and of this I take but little, in consequence of the severe illness I experience on the following morning. If I take grog or punch, the symptoms, including the loss of power of seeing colours, are still more severe." Simple congestion of the head and eyes, especially when accompanied with fatigue, is also an exciting cause of achromatopsy. Ruete states, that a girl suddenly lost the faculty of distinguishing colours as a conse- quence of congestion ; and we have known instances produced by exhaustion. A clergyman, 45 years of age, of full habit, but enjoying good health, was performing Di- vine service in the month of June, 185), and felt fatigued and oppressed by heat and theVISION. 1459 5 a 2 close atmosphere of the church. At the con- clusion of the service, on rising from the kneeling posture, he was alarmed at finding that the crimson velvet cushion and hangings of the pulpit appeared of a dark violet hue, and that other familiar objects which he knew to be red, had likewise changed to bluish green ; there was at the same time some gid- diness and discomfort in the head. Having rested in the vestry about ten minutes, the symptoms gradually passed away, the crimson objects becoming less and less blue, and the red objects gradually resuming their proper colour. Aperient medicine, &c, was pre- scribed, and we are not aware of any other attack having been experienced. Another case occurred during the great Exhibition in Hyde Park. A stout plethoric farmer, aged 52, visited London, and had undergone much fatigue and excitement in seeing the various objects of interest. On the third day, alter spending some hours in the exhibition, he felt giddy and oppressed, and remarked that the crimson hangings appeared of a dull brownish green. This led him to notice other objects, and he ascertained that he could no longer discern the difference be- tween reds and greens generally, though yel- lows and blues retained their proper colour. On his Laving the building, the uniform of the Ibotguards and the colour of the foliage of the trees, nearly assimilated. When he reached home, he slept for three hours ; and on awaking, was much relieved at finding that the power of discerning colours had re- turned. The extraordinary variety and glare of co- lours at the exhibition was singularly dis- tressing to the eyes, and numerous persons suffered from congestion of the choroid in consequence. According to M. Cunier, temporary achro- matopsy almost always constitutes one of the symptoms of congestive amblyopia in per- sons affected with hemorrhoids and venous congestion of the abdomen. The confusion between the sensations of red and blue, takes place every time that the encephalo-ocular turgescence is augmented by the erf'ect of a lively emotion, anger, a rapid walk, too great application of the eyes, &c* That eminent oculist relates the following case. He was consulted by an officerof artillery, who suffered in a slight degree from congestive amblyopia. Every time that he performed manoeuvres, and fatigue increased the cerebro-ocular con- gestion, the men appeared dressed entirely in blue ; the white waistbelts he distinguished, but the red worsted epaulets, the red tuft of the shako, the facings of the coat and red stripes down the trowsers, appeared blue. He could see that the shako and trowsers were of black cloth. A brief repose, with cold water to the eyes and forehead, soon re- stored natural vision. An interesting example of temporary achro- matopsy, doubtless the effect of congestion, is related by Professor Wartmann. M Thury, an ex-professor of botany in the academy of Lausanne, had walked during the night from Geneva to Nyon to witness a magnificent aurora borealis, which shone on the night of the 17th and 18th of November, 1848. To his great surprise and disappointment, he could not discern any difference between the blue of the sky and the magnificent blood colour of the aurora, which was viewed with rapture by all around. Singular to say, another lady of Geneva, a septuagenarian, presented precisely the same peculiarity, though both she and the professor had distinctly seen mam previous auroras. The following case, which occurred under our own observation, is an example of tem- porary achromatopsy caused by vitiated blood circulating through the brain and retina, and disturbing the functions of those organs: — Mr. H., a solicitor aged 37, of a spare make and melancholic temperament, is fre- quently subject to attacks of congestion of the liver followed by vomiting and purging of bile. These attacks are ushered in by dull pain in the head and tenderness of the eye- balls, rendering motion of them distressing. At such times he is quite incapable of dis- tinguishing colours, all objects being simply divided into two classes, black and white with their intermediate shades of grey. The vision of objects continues perfectly distinct, but it is not until the portal system has been relieved that the perception of colours is recovered, and then yellow is the first dis- tinguished. If however he takes five grains of calomel, the attack is cut short and the power of discriminating colours at once re- stored. There is nothing whatever unusual about his eyes, and under ordinary circum- stances he possesses perfectly natural vision. Achromatopsy may be the result of injury, as in the following case related by Dr. Boys de Loury.* An individual was struck by a pistol ball which entered his mouth without touch- ing the tongue and broke through the hard palate and base of the orbit. After his re- covery from the wound, the injured eye re- tained but little sight; only a small spot of the retina was sensible to light, and to use this, the eye was obliged to be thrown con- siderably to one side. Then objects were seen distinctly but without colour. This person described a palette spread with co- lours, as a plate with many holes, and con- founded the thumb opening with the spots where the colours were placed. Various explanations, differing widely, have been offered to account for the insensibility of the eyes to colour ; and we may re- mark that the subjects of this affection have in several instances been men of intellectual eminence. As for example, the metaphy- sician Dugald Stewart, Dr. Dalton the illus- trious chemist, Mr. Troughton the eminent optician, Dr. Sonimers, Dr. Unzer, of Al- tona, and Professor Brandis. The opinion Op. cit. p. 49. * Revue M&licale, Nov. 18-13.1460 VISION. advanced by Dalton and supported with the ability for which he was remarkable, was this : " It appears therefore almost beyond a doubt that one of. the humours of my eye and of the eyes of my fellows, is a coloured medium, probably some modification of blue. I suppose it must be the vitreous humour : otherwise I apprehend it might be discovered by inspection, which has not been done."* Before his death, the great chemist had re- quested his friend Dr. Ransome to examine his eyes after his demise : this was done most carefully, and it was ascertained that though the crystalline lens had the slight yellow tinge common in old persons, the vitreous humour of both eyes was absolutely colourless. Nevertheless the h\ pothesis has been revived by Dr. Trinchinetti -f-, who considers that the defect is produced by a coloration of one or more of the transparent meilia of the eye, and probably of the crystalline lens, and even goes so far as to advise depression or extraction of the lens as a means of radical cure ! Goethef attributed the confusion of colours to an insensibility to blue ; whereas Szokalski expressly states § that among more than sixty cases of achromatopsy, of which he had notes, there was not one in which there was abso- lute deficiency of the perception of blue. Others again have supposed that the retina itself has a blueish tinge in such cases, whilst Dr. Thomas Young || attributed achromatopsy to the absence or paralysis of those fibres of the retina which are calculated to perceive red. The able metaphysician Dugald Stewart%, has viewed the subject from a different point. " In the power (says he) of conceiving colours, too, there are striking differences among individuals. And indeed I am inclined to suspect that in the greater number of in- stances the supposed defects of sight in this respect ought to be ascribed rather to a defect in the power of conception. One thing is certain, that we often see men who are perfectly sensible of the difference be- tween two colours when they are presented to them, who cannot give names to these colours with confidence when they see them apart, and are perhaps apt to confound the one with the other. Such men, it should seem, feel the sensation of colour like other n.en when the object is present, but are incapable (probably in consequence of some early habit of inattention) to conceive the sensation distinctly when the object is re- moved." This explanation would have weight sup- posing persons had rare opportunities of contrasting colours, for then their memory * Mem. of the Literary and Phil. Soc. of Man- chester, p. 43. f Atti della sesta Riunione degli Scienziati Itali- ani, p. 712. % Zur Farbenlchre, §§ 111 to 113. § Annales d'Oculistique, torn. iii. p. 7. || Phil.

Nevertheless Dr. Himly has adopted the same view. It is on record however that intelligent persons have expressly de- clared that their infirmity arose from no care- lessness on their part, as they had made many earnest endeavours to correct it.* By phrenologists, achromatopsy has been attributed to imperfect development of the organ of colour; Szokalski, though believ- ing that there exists in the brain a portion which presides over the function of vision, and that this portion is diminished in volume in persons affected with achromatopsy, adds, " We know well that phrenologists place the organ of colour in the middle of the super- ciliary arch ; we have, however, examined scrupulously and with great pains many persons who have presented very decided depressions of this arch ; but despite of the best wishes in the world, we could never discover in them any trace of chromatop- seudopsy."-j- Neither does our own experience support the theory of the phrenologists; in two well- marked Daltonians examined by us, the whole superciliary region was remarkably well de- veloped. The vision of the late Mr. Troughton was carefully investigated by Sir John Herschel, who instituted a series of ingenious experi- ments for the purpose of ascertaining, if possible, the cause of the imperfection. The result at which he arrived was, " that all the prismatic rays have the power of exciting and affecting the eyes with the sensa- tion of light, and producing distinct vision, so that the defect arises from no insensibility of the retina to rays of any particular refran- gibiiity, nor to any colouring matter in the humours of the eyes preventing certain rays from reaching the retina, but from a defect in the sensorium by which it is rendered in- capable of appreciating exactly those dif- ferences between rays on which their colour depends. | Hartmann$ is of opinion that it is by ana- lysis that we arrive at a knowledge of ob- jects which present themselves to our notice ; he supposes that we do not perceive them instantly, but little by little and only by exa- mination ot their distance, form and colour, which scrutiny rests on a series of changes operating on the retina, ciliary nerves, and motor ocular nerves : we do not easily recognize objects unless this succession of modifications has become habitual and takes * See GlasgowMedica-l Journal, vol. ii. p. 17 ; Op. it. p. 100. t Op. cit. p. 100. 1 Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, article "Light." § Der Geist des Mensehen, S. 152. 1820.VISION. 14GL 5 a 3 place easily, hence achromatopsy results from a certain state of torpor and indolence of the retina and motor muscles of the eye! Professor Wartmann, the most recent au- thority upon this suhject, stated in his first Memoir that achromatopsy (or Daltonism) has its origin in a defect of the sensorium. In his second Memoir he enters at length into a somewhat different explanation of the phenomena. " I admit (says he) with Harvey, Young, Jiingken, Midler, and others that its seat is in the retina, and [ think that it is produced by an abnormal state of the nervous expansion, in such sort that it reacts equally under two or more differently coloured vi- brations. If the vibration caused by a ray of red is identical with that engendered by a green ray, there will be confusion of these colours. This theory is independent of all systems destined to explain light. * * * The theory which explains Daltonism by an ab- normal elasticity of the retina has the ad- vantage of substituting a reasonable physical condition for a vague notion of the sensorium : besides, it is supported by facts, because the injuries which alter the ordinary constitution of the visual organ are capable of exciting, permanently or temporarily, a false perception of colours. Lastly it appears to be confirmed by the circumstance that with many Daltonians the eye sees less distinctly the red rays than those of which the rei'rangibility is greater. * The actual seat of the phenomena of achro- matopsy must, after all, remain matter of speculation, as it is one of those things in- capable of demonstration. D'Alembert says : " It is very plain that the word colour does not designate any property of body, bnt merely a modification of our mind : that, for instance, whiteness and redness exist only in us, and by no means in the bodies to which we refer them by a habit in force from in- fancy." The knowledge that we possess of the existence of colours is derived from the evidence afforded by the thousands of persons endowed with the power of distinguishing them, and therefore we conclude that they do exist. But supposing we were all like Dalton and many others whose visual organs never appreciate red any more than the gene- rality of eyes distinguish the calorific or ac- tinic rays, we should then not be aware of the existence of the colour called red, which plays so conspicuous a part in the adornment of the universe ; or if some few eyes gifted with superior powers discerned it, the majority would have to admit its existence on the evidence of others, not from knowledge de- rived from their own eyes As regards remedial measures, Wartmann and Seebeck recommend the employment or coloured glasses of a certain known tint; suppose this tint red, the impression of a green body and of a red body at first the * Deuxieme Me'moire, p. 46. Dr. Wartmann enters at length into the discussion of this subject, but our space will not admit of our extracting his ingenious arguments. same to the naked eye will be distinguished by the use of the transparent screen. Wartmann, however, admits that this me- thod only remedies mistakes in the specific nature of colours, and not those which apply to the shades of one and the same tint. Jiingken and Chelius have recommended the use of coloured batids, bearing the name of their colour, and Szokalski has suggested that sensations of the various shades may be ex- cited by fixing the eyes on different coloured patterns, and then on a black or white surface. But this proceeding is scarcely so likely to he productive of benefit as that recommended by Professor Wartmann. Should the achromatopsy result from con- gestion, such means should be adopted as are best calculated to subdue it; as depletion, purgatives, and low diet. If it arises from menstrual suppression, it will be proper to pre- scribe emmenagogues, with mustard pedituvia, hip baths, and such other means as are likely to restore the catamenia. Should derange- ment of the hepatic system be the exciting cause, a dose of calomel, followed by a bla'-k draught, will often be sufficient to remove it; but it will be proper to follow such a pre- scription with alterative doses of mercurials and saline aperients, of which the Pullna and Marienbad waters are very serviceable : ta- raxacum with or without the nitro-muriatic acid may also be advisable. Dyspepsia is too protean a disorder for us to attempt more than to suggest the pro- priety of carefutly investigating the parti- culars of cases where the insensibility to colour can be traced to this cause, and of laying down such a plan of treatment, medical and general, as seems best adapted to the exigencies of each individual case. Hyperckromatopsy (v-nip, be\ond ; xp^/J-a, colour; c!i|/iy, vision).— Our knowledge of this condition of the vision which may be regarded as the opposite to achromatopsy, is at present very limited, and is chiefly derived from the publications of Dr. Sachs * and Dr Cornaz.'f' As we have never had an op- portunity of investigating a case of the sort, we can only draw our information from these and some other sources. Dr. Sachs is, we believe, an albino, and is in addition affected with hyperchromatopsy. The first account of this very singular anomaly of vision was published by him, and other instances have since been discovered. Pro- fessor Wartmann, of Geneva, in a communi- cation with which he recently favoured us, thus writes:—" Quant a I'Hyperchromatopsie, e'est une affection qui n'est probublement pas extremement rare. Je connais deux personnes qui m'ontdit en etre atteintes, et j'espere etre un jour en etat de publier quelques recherches sur ce sujet.

It does not appear that the same colours always attach to the same objects with different individuals ; on this point there is considerable diversity, but as the account published by Dr. Sachs of his own perceptions is the most minute which has appeared, we shall take it as the ground of the following description :— The objects to which colours especially connect themselves in this condition of vision are, figures, dates, the clays of the week, the letters of the alphabet, and musical notes. These colours are not all equally distinct: the clearest are yellow, different shades of pure white and blueish white ; the less clear are orange, red, dull white, dark blue, brown and green. Black only attaches itself to one of the letters of the alphabet. This morbid sensibility to colours thus displays itself:—• A anil E are red, but the first has more of the vermillion tint, the second most of the rose. I is white, O orange, U black, and is the only example of black ; UE or U is white, so is M and N. C is of a pale ash colour. D is yellow. F of a dull white. H a blueish ash colour. K approaches deep green. S is of deep blue, and W is brown. Musical notes indicated by the names of the letters ^0 ^ et csetera, present gene- rally the same colours as these ; however whilst in the alphabet, B and G appear almost colourless, the Si flat appears of an ash grey, and the Sol of an uncertain green. < )f figures, 0 is almost transparent, of a pale and uncertain yellow, 1 of an undecided white, 2 of an uncertain tint, 3 almost ash coloured, 4 minium red, 5 yellow, 6 indigo, 7 blueish white, 8 brown, 9 almost deep green. The numbers composed of several figures take the colours of the last forming them. 0 does not change the colours of the figures to which it is joined, but gives to them a certain appearance, whilst a figure often repeated in the same number causes the colour proper to it to increase in intensity. 10, 11, 100, 110 and 11 1 are white ; the first of them re- sembles white glass, the second is milk- colour, the third semi-transparent white ; the two last perfect white. 14, 24, 40, 44, 400 and 440 are red, but 15, 25, 50, 55, 500, 555 and 1000 are yellow; why the 1000 is yellow whilst 100 is white we do not understand, as the addi- tional 0 does not account for it Sunday, is to the eyes of this conscientious observer, white slightly tinged with yellow. Monday, another shade of white ; the co- lour of Tuesday is obscure and undecided. Wednesday is yellow ; Thursday is of a yellowish green, verging towards orange. Friday of a dull white, and Saturday is of a blueish ash colour. It is stated that the abnormal sensations these objects, that some can only be seen without them by a strong mental effort, and that in the case of others this does not suffice. In the present state of our knowledge we are not in a position to offer any satisfactory explanation of this singular anomaly of vision. That its seat is not in the eye but in the sensorium is however most probable, and in this opinion Dr. Wartmann concurs. More extended opportunities for observations will doubtless throw additional light on what must be regarded as a very curious subject. Anorthopia (a, not; bpGbs, straight; litpis, vi- sion).— This is a condition of vision far from uncommon, and is characterised by the in- dividuals subject to it being unable to discern when objects are not parallel one to the other, and is often accompanied by a want of ability to distinguish whether objects are symme- trical. Such persons are incapable of drawing objects correctly; a house will be sketched with its proportions wrong and leaning on one side, and a figure will be equally unna- tural, yet the artist wi l be sublimely un- conscious of any defects. They are unable to discern whether pictures are straight on the walls, or blinds drawn parallel with the windovv frame; Negroes are very subject to this peculiarity of vision. Nothing is more common than to see them, when mark- ing out the ground-plan of a house, path, or boundary wall, draw the lines as awry as possible, and yet persist that they are quite straight, nor can they be convinced to the contrary. It has appeared to us that the persons in whom this condition of vision existed in a marked degree, were charac- terised by unsymmetrical heads and faces, but this may have been a coincidence merely. In children who show evidences of anor- thopia, pains should be taken to overcome it by practice and tuition. They should write upon ruled paper at first, and when subse- quently writing on ordinary paper, should always be made to place it straight before them and to write across it by the hand moving on the wrist which should be a fixed point, and seldom moved. In drawing, the correctness of the lines should be ascer- tained by admeasurement ; and the study of geometry, perspective, and all other branches requiring attention to symmetry are calculated to be of service. Myopia {fivai, I shut; aty, the eye), commonly called near sight, is an affection almost, if not entirely, confined to civilization. Every eye, when in a state of repose, is adapted by its size, figure, and the refrac- tive powers of its media, to the formation of a distinct image of an object presented before it, at one particular d/stance. This differs in different individuals; but from 12 to 20 inches may be regarded as the distance at which ordinary print is legible, the shortest distance at which it can be seen clearly and without exertion being from 6 to 8 inches. A person who brings small objects nearer to the eyes1463 VISION. It is commonly supposed that a certain visible conformation of the eye exists in con- nection with, and characterises myopia ; that the eye is full, the cornea prominent, the an- terior chamber large, &c.: but this is by no means necessarily the case; for it may happen that of two individuals in whom the apparent configuration of the eyes is the same, one will be myopic, the other presbyopic. It is also a popular belief that near-sight decreases with age ; such does not accord with our experi- ence. We have repeatedly seen persons above sixty years of age as near-sighted as in their youth, and are acquainted with a lady of eighty-five, who has certainly never fatigued her eyes with work or reading, and who still uses, and has used for many years, a No. 7. myopic glass. Myopia may arise from imperfection in the form, consistence, or relation of some of the refractive media ; or it may result from the loss of adjusting power. The first description may be induced by too great convexity either of the cornea or lens, or both ; by an undue density of any of the refractive media ; by a too great distance between the cornea and retina, &c. The effect is always the same, namely, to cause the rays of light to be so much refracted that, in place of being concen- trated to a focus exactly on the retina—a point essential to distinct vision—they are brought to a focus before reaching it. It is a law in optics that the nearer an object is brought to the eye, the more divergent are the rays proceeding from it, and consequently the greater the distance at which they will be collected in a focus by refractive media. For this reason it is that near-sighted persons habitually hold objects very close to their eyes, as by that means the image is thrown back upon the retina. One of the causes of imperfect vision in such persons, is the circle of dissipation formed on the retina by the rays after they have crossed at the focal point. This is principally produced by the circum- ferential rays; and if these can be excluded, vision is rendered much more distinct. Thus it is that great assistance is afforded by look- ing through a pin-hole in a card, and even by holding to the eye a hollow roll of paper, or the hand partially closed. The habit of half shutting the lids which has given the name to the affection, has reference to the same object — the exclusion of the circum- ferential rays. In connection with this point, we may mention that the reason stars are seen earlier in the evening twilight with the assist- ance of tubes than without, is, as pointed out by Arago, that the tube cuts off a large portion of the disturbing diffused light of the atmospheric strata which intervene between the star and the eye. In like manner a tube is useful even in a dark night in preventing the lateral impression of the faint light which the particles of air re- ceive from all the other stars in the sky, and thereby increases the intensity of the lumi- nous image and the apparent size of the star. Distant objects appear large to near-sighted persons, because a distinct picture is formed only at the point of intersection of the rays proceeding from an object ; as this point falls short of the retina in such persons, the retina receives the rays beyond the point of intersection, and they are consequently more extended. Myopes also read with more ease in partial darkness than those whose sight is perfect. The quantity of vays from an object is always in an inverse ratio to the square of the distance; and as these persons naturally bring the object close to the eye, they receive the f ull benefit of all the light proceeding from it; whereas other persons are obliged under similar circumstances to close the lids and contract the pupils to see distinctly, whereby much less light enters their eyes than those of myopic individuals ; hence they see with greater effort and less distinctness. In congenital myopia the pupils are fre- quently large, and do not contract fully. To compensate for this the persons acquire the habit of knitting the brows and half closing the lids, which gives them a characteristic appearance. The handwriting of near-sighted persons is generally small and cramped, the proximity of the letters to the eyes increasng the visual angle subtended by them, thus increasing their apparent size. Among the exciting causes of acquired myopia are, overwork of the eyes at the focus for near objects, the indiscreet use of glasses, and the necessity of working in obscure light. The first and last may be c'assed together, and apply especially to engravers, watch- makers, jewellers, and other artificers, the nature of whose work requires close inspec- tion. But there is yet another class espe- cially subject to this impairment of vision, namely, literary men. The public are little aware of the extent to which the studious and those who live by the exercise of their intel- lect, suffer from imperfection of sight. Many instances have fallen under our notice of poor students and writers, whose poverty compelled them to pursue their literary avocations in the gloom of dusky apartments, or by the aid of a dim candle, and who have become myopic and amblyopic in consequence. And scarcely less numerous are those who are visited with this affliction though pursuing their la- bours under more favourable circumstances. It would appear that even the study of oph- thalmic science may cause the same penalty to be paid; for M. Desmarres informs us that one of his pupils became very myopic by exerting his eyes too much in the diagnosis of diseases of the eye ; a sad result of most rare industry. A common cause of myopia is the improper use of eye glasses. In this country they are often worn from affectation ; but in France glasses are used by the young men who wish to escape the conscription, for the deliberate purpose of rendering themselves near-sighted, that constituting a ground for exemption During the years 1831, 1832, and 1833, 7\3 per 1000 of the conscripts examined inVISION. 14G1 France were rejected on the score of short sight. Oculo-cerebral congestion may give rise to myopia ; a case alluded to by Smith was probably of this nature, — that of a person who suddenly became myopic on coming out of a cold bath. And Revielle-Parise men- tions an officer who was similarly attacked at the end of a troublesome ague. Local con- gestion is said to produce the same effect. Desmarres relates a remarkable instance of a lady excessively presbyopic, who became near- sighted during a severe attack of conjunc- tivitis, the former condition of vision returning after the attack had subsided. Mr. Tyrrell also mentions a lady who had long suffered from granular lids, which were eventually cured, but she afterwards required the aid of concave glasses, from the cornea having become un- usually convex during the continuance of the chronic disease. In each of these cases, there may have been some change, either in the quantity or quality of the aqueous humour, or in the consistence of the cornea. Itis very common to meet with eyes differing in their focal length, and in such cases one usually falls into disuse ; it is also occasion- ally found that one eye will be myopic and the other presbyopic, a condition of vision embarrassing to the patient and the sur- geon ; but the nature of which may easily be ascertained by careful trial with glasses. D •. Serre, in a memoir on the application of phosphenes, or the luminous spectra excited by compression of the eye *, states that these as- sist in the diagnosis of myopia. He says that in such cases the nasal and orbital phos- phenes appear equal to the temporal in con- stancy, brilliancy, and sometimes in size ; but he cautions us against concluding that the re- tinae of myopes are more sensitive than those of persons having normal vision, ascribing the above appearances to the greater prominence of the eyes, which facilitates compression, and admits of its application to the deeper parts of the eye. These results he adds, are at com- plete variance with the opinion of M. Stceber of Strasburg, who thinks that the proximal cause of myopia may sometimes be a peculiar alteration of the retina admitting of a compli- cation of myopia with amblyopia, or com- mencing amaurosis ; for that if the retina be essentially affected, the orbital, and sometimes the nasal phosphenes are scarcely appreciable, or they may be entirely wanting. Dr. Serre further asserts that which is certainly con- trary to received opinions, and (we may add), to our own experience, that when the foci of two 1113'opic eyes differ, the retina of the eye with the shortest focus being that least used, is absolutely stronger and more active than the retina of the other eye. Myopia may be symptomatic of hydro- phthalmia, and of conical cornea. In the former case it will be accompanied with enlargement, and symptoms indicating some inflammation of the eye. In the latter, the change of form * Annales d'Oculistique, torn. xxiv. p. 161. in the cornea will he apparent on close exa- mination.* Instances have also come under our notice of congenital cataract having been mistaken for niyoj ia. "f In such cases the patients have dull vision, and are unable to see small objects distinctly even with the aid of glasses. On careful examination a greyish hue may be detected in the pupils ; and if these be dilated by atropine, the nature of the case is at once displayed by the semi-opaque or slightly turbid lenses be- coming visible. The progress of myopia depends very muc h upon the line of conduct pursued by the indi- vidual. If that be judicious from the com- mencement, the defect may not increase, or if acquired, may diminish ; but its march is too often as follows: — A person who is occupied for months together in reading small type (for example), finds that he discerns distant objects less and less distinctly, and at once jumps to the conclusion that spectacles are required ; he goes to an optician, tries a pair, sees better, purchases then), and proceeds with his labour. After a time he finds that these glasses do not afford the same amount of assistance they did at first; they are care- fully wiped, but still are not satisfactory, and therefore a pair of a higher power are purchased ; with these he sees sharply at first, though they do diminish a little ; but they in time are laid aside, and the individual goes on and on, until the whole scale has been run through, and he is half blinded for the remainder of his life. In the progress of such a case other symptoms often develop them- selves ; not only is the sight rapidly shortened, but it is weakened ; the eyes ache, and are speedily fatigued by application ; there is op- pression about the brow, and often headach; he is teased with muscae volitantes, and the sight is obscured from time to time by a mist. The case now assumes the character of impaired vision from overwork, and unless judicious treatment be adopted, amaurosis may be the result. It is important to know that near sight may be acquired in childhood by the common practice that children have, of approaching their eyes very close to any object on which their attention may be engaged. When learn- ing to read or write, or draw, they almost invariably hold their faces sideways, nearly touching the slate or paper. This should at all times be discouraged. In like manner infants should not have very small toys given them, or such as require to be looked at closely, for not only may they be rendered short-sighted, but strabismus may be caused, for as the visual axes naturally converge when objects are held very near the eyes, the frequent repetition of this may occasion a squint. For the same reason there is sound judgment in printing children's books in good bold type, and it is well to encourage young people to observe distant objects, and to describe what they * See Practical Remarks on Near Sight, pp. 47. 50. I London Journal of Bledicine, vol. i. p. 507.VISION. 110.3 sec in trees, landscapes, the exterior of houses, &c. As a general rule glasses are not ad- missible for young persons, for if worn there is scarcely any hope t f amendment; but it is sometimes necessary to allow them during music lessons, in which case they should be of the lowest power that enables the child to see the notes, and their use should be re- stricted to that pursuit. Myopic persons, generally, should remove objects they are regarding as far from them as possible, and should avoid small type, minute writing, and microscopical inves- tigations. The use of a high desk is very important, not merely as tending to prevent oculo-cerebral congestion, but also pain in the chest, which is often caused by stooping ; and as a general rule, all near-sighted persons, of whatever age, should exercise the eyes, when in the open air, by endeavouring to make out distant objects. There is a simple plan which persons who write or read much should adopt as being highly serviceable in preserving the powers of their vision. It is that of raising their eyes from their work at short intervals, and fixing them upon the cornice of the ceiling at the further end of the room, and if there be a pattern, making it out. This exercises the eyes at the focus for distant objects; and, simple as it is, is of great use in preventing nearsight. There is a form of myopia of which we have seen several examples, and which is deserving of attention. It occurs in young persons, and leads to unmerited punish- ment. The youth does not hold his book so near the eyes as to attract attention, and reads fluently at perhaps eight or ten inches ; but he cannot see objects distinctly at twenty feet. Such young persons have been brought to us under the impression that they were " sham- ming;" but careful investigation convinced us that such was not the case. Great responsi- bility attaches to the advice given in a case of this description, as on it depends much of the comfort of the individual during life. He should by no means be allowed glasses, as they would most assuredly confirm the mis- chief. His books should be of large type ; he should frequently rest his eyes when study- ing ; should be much in the open air ; and the eyes should be often bathed with cold spring water. Presbyopia (irptagvs, old ; the eye) is that condition of vision in which objects are not distinctly perceived unless they are at some distance from the eye. Although not neces- sarily confined to advanced years, it is one of the changes which warn the individual that the prime of Life is past, as it usually com- mences about the age of forty. To a person in whom presbyopia is com- mencing, distant objects appear as clear and sharply defined as ever ; but reading, writing, and working, especially by candlelight, be- come irksome and distressing. The eyes feel strained, and there is uneasiness over the brow sometimes amounting to headach ; the page of a book appears misty, the type con- fused at the ordinary reading distance, and a strong light is indispensable. The person therefore draws the candle to him, and holds the book close to it nearly at arm's length, throwing his head back to increase the dis- tance. These symptoms are the result of changes in the eye which cause the converging rays of light to be brought to a focus beyond the retina, upon which a confused and imperfect image is consequently depicted. They may be the result either of flattening of the cornea or the crystalline lens, diminution in the density of the humors, or diminished curvature of the retina. Absence of the crystalline lens pro- duces the same effect in an extreme degree. The explanation of the feelings of dis- comfort, and other presbyopic symptoms, is simply this — the object being removed to a greater distance than is natural, the visual angle is reduced in size, the picture on the retina diminished, and the quantity of light becomes less: hence the retina, with its some- what impaired .sensibility is unable to appre- ciate the object without effort, and a con- siderable increase of light. The necessity for this increased quantity of light is a frequent cause of amblyopia super- vening upon presbyopia, for a very large number of work-people pursue their avoca- tions in densely crowded and ill lighted rooms, and they are obliged to struggle on despite of their failing sight. Dr. Sichel states that one of the causes which renders amblyopia in connection with presbyopia so common in the conciergeries of Paris is, that the majority of persons are tailors and shoemakers, who almost without exception inhabit confined rooms called loges, into which light and air can scarcely penetrate. Presbyopia may be con- genital, and it is frequently excited in persons under thirty, by the injurious habit of wearing convex glasses, miscalled " preservers." Among the lower and even the middle classes the belief is general that if from any cause the sight is weakened, such glasses are beneficial, an impression most fallacious. It however answers the purpose of some advertising op- ticians to encourage the idea, regardless of the consequences to their victims. M. Desmarres states* that country people are almost all attacked with presbyopia at an early age, because their sight is much exer- cised on distant objects, and very little on near objects, whereas the dwellers in towns are attacked later in life. It may be so in France, but is certainly not the case in Eng- land. The same writer affirms that this im- perfection in sight is rife in countries where the light is very bright. The first indications of presbyopia are always perceived in the evening, and it is im- portant that they should be distinctly borne in mind. During the day, persons past the meridian of life, accustomed to read, write, or work can do so without inconvenience, but as * Traite' des Maladies des Yeux, p. 809.VISION. the shades of evening draw in and lights are introduced, they find that tliey cannot fix their eyes upon their work as before, without fatigue ; if they persist, this fatigue increases, and after a time amounts to headach ; but if they put on convex glasses of a low power, all discomfort vanishes, and their sight is at once restored, and they can pursue their occupa- tions with perfect ease. If however they persist in abstaining from glasses, and by in- creasing the light endeavour to improve their sight, the retina will be over stimulated, and in addition to presbyopia, they will acquire dull and imperfect vision of all objects, far as well as near. There are persons whose sight, never par- ticularly good, but who from easy circum- stances have used it little, become alarmed at finding, about the age of fifty, that their eyes appear to have suddenly failed, and they think they are becoming blind, Many such cases have fallen under our observation. The facts are simply these : presbyopia has advanced so slowly and gently, and the eyes have been used so little, that until the defect has become confirmed, the parties are uncon- scious of its existence. Some accidental cir- cumstance, as an attempt to read a news- paper in the evening, reveals the imperfection: proper glasses are alone required to restore the vision. Belladonna and atropine produce temporary presbyopia by suspending the power of ad- justment, the eye being fixed at the focus for distant objects. Mydriasis also renders the individual more or less presbyopic. Presby- opia may be converted into myopia, and vice versa, of which cases are related by various writers.* Dr. Sichel has justly pointed out that neu- ralgia of the eye-ball is by no means infre- quent in connection with presbyopia. We have seen several instances, and generally traced it to overstraining the eyes in efforts to read or work without glasses. The pain is at first transient, but if the exciting cause be continued, it becomes more severe and per- sistent, extending from the eye to the neigh- bouring parts and not readily yielding to treatment. In such a case, rest to the eyes is all important in the first instance, and suitable glasses are indispensable. The chief remedial measures for presbyopia are comprised in the early and judicious use of suitable glasses, but the means of prolonging natural sight and of staying the progress of presbyopia are as follows : — Persons habitually engaged in minute work should ascertain by experiment the greatest distance at which they can clearly and with- out effort see their work, and always endea- vour to maintain that distance; they should raise their eyes from time to time, and direct them to some object at the opposite end of the room to alter the focus: but when en- gaged in lighter pursuits they may if agree- * See Practical Remarks on Xear Sight, But, pp. 90—95. able read at less than their working distance. In reading or writing just that amount and quality of light is proper which thoroughly illuminates the object, and yet feels grateful and pleasant to the eyes. It is injurious to face the light; the best position when reading is with the light rather behind and on one side; the eyes are thus protected from all heat and glare, while the object is fully illu- minated. When this arrangement is incon- venient, a screen or shade may be used with advantage. Heading by twilight and firelight is highly injurious to feeble eyes. Stooping over work should be avoided as one great cause of congestion of the eyes; for which reason a high desk is useful. Whenever the ey es feel fatigued, a few minutes' rest and bathing with cold water will be refreshing and beneficial. There are two descriptions of lenses jin common use for spectacles, the dou- ble concave for short sight, the double convex for long or aged sight; plano-convexes and piano-concaves arc scarcely ever employed. It sometimes happens however that the cur- vatures of the surfaces are unequal; for in- stance, a ten-inch lens may be required, but the optician may not have what is technically called the "tool" of the proper curve, and therefore selects two tools, the numbers of which combined make ten—as one of seven and the other of three inches—and the lens produced by these, though with surfaces of very unequal curvature, answers the purpose perfectly. Periscopic glasses were invented by Dr. Wollaston, but are seldom employed, and there are others with attractive names but not deserving of particular notice. A common prejudice exists in favour of pebbles, but it is erroneous, for whilst on the one hand their chief merit consists in extreme hardness so that they are not easily scratched, that very hardness renders them difficult to cut and grind, many being broken in the process. They are expensive from this cir- cumstance, and the difficulty of meeting with crystal of sufficent size which is pure and without flaw. Crown glass is now made of such excellent quality and so colourless that lenses made, from it possess every qualifica- tion that can be desired. Among the many singular things characteristic of the Chinese is their spectacles. Without knowing any- thing of the theory of the convergence and divergence of light by means of lenses, both convex and concave lenses are used all over the empire, and of such a singular size and shape that there can be little doubt of their being original inventions. They are made of rock crystal ground with the powder of corundum and are of immense size, being re- tained in their position on the face by means of silken cords with weights attached, which are slung over the ears. Frames, of whatever material they may be formed (anil blue or bronze steel is the best), .should possess the following qualifications. The rims should accurately fit the form of the lenses, and be sufficiently strong to re- tain them; the connecting arch or bridge14C7 VISION. must he of such width and shape that it will fit the nose accurately, and maintain the centre of each glass in front of the axis of the corresponding eye. This is a point of great importance, otherwise the eyes will not have the full "assistance of the lenses. The necessity for the bridge being adapted correctly was proved by a case that re- cently came under our notice, where a wart on the side of the nose had degenerated into a scirrhous growth from the friction of an ill fitting spectacle frame which constantly pressed upon, and irritated that point. The lateral branches of the frame should be suffi- ciently strong and elastic to retain it in its place, firmly and immoveably under all move- ments of the head ; and they should be of such a shape and size that no undue pressure can be caused on the temples or sides of the head. Besides the injury to the eyes from ill-fitting frames, persons acquire the habit of grimacing in their efforts to see through them. Hand glasses and those retained on the nose by a spring are objectionable ; the latter, when clipping the nose, almost invariably throw the centres of the glasses out of the axial lines of the eyes, and both are deficient in that steadiness which is indispensable to perfect and comfortable vision. The power of bi-convex glasses is indicated by their numbers, and these numbers signify the inches of the focal length. The numbering of the French glasses, whether presbyopic or myopic, has a much more extensive range than the British, as will be seen by the following lists. Presbyopic (French). 80, 72, 60,48, 36, .30, 24, 20, 18,72, 60, 48, 30, 30, 24, 20, 18, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4^, 4, 3?- 3, 2-1, 2, 1A, 11. ^Myopic {French). 60, 30, 20, IS, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3f, S.±, 3, 23-, 2i, 2, lA, 14, 14, 1. Presbyopic (British). 48, 36, 30, 24, 20, 18, 14, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, &i, 5, 4.}, 4, 3j>, 2f, 2f, 91 9-3- 9 I 3- H '•T' -10' ~> 1 4» 1 1' Myopic (British). 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, II, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,20. The numbers of the double convex glasses below 5 in both scales are confined to patients who have undergone the operation for cataract. The golden rule in the selection of spec- tacles, whether for myopia or presbyopia, is to choose the lowest power that is productive of distinct vision ; and so long as these afford the necessary assistance the party should rest contented, for if he begins with too high a number or rashly increases the power, it will be found not only difficult to go back, but equally so to subdue the inclination for further increase. A myopic person should therefore select glasses which will enable him to distinguish the outlines of objects distinctly at about forty-five feet, without diminishing them in the slightest degree ; and with these he should be satisfied, not changing them for a higher power unless absolutely obliged. It frequently happens that the eyes of myopic persons arc of different focal length, in which case great care should be taken by diligent trial to determine the powers which will bring the eyes to perfect equality, and with these lenses the frames should be fitted ; but there is another condition of vision which is sometimes embarrassing ; it is when one eye is myopic and the other presbyopic. This can only be ascertained by careful trial of each eye with convex and concave lenses, and the results are sometimes quite unex- pected ; if therefore a person using glasses complains of faulty vision with one eye, which cannot be satisfactory accounted for, it is proper to try the eye with a different descrip- tion of lens, which will frequently show the nature of the case at once. Eyes thus faulty require a double convex and a double concave lens fitted into the same frame, and the same rules apply to their selection, as to glasses generally. In England the lowest power in use for presbyopia is a glass of 48 inch focus; in France it is otherwise, as will be seen by reference to the table already given. M. Sichel commences with a 72 inch, and in some cases with a 96 inch; Mr. A. Ross, however, who has had an im- mense amount of experience as an optician, informs us that he has met with but one per- son who could perceive any sensible difference between these two powers, as far as assistance to the sight was concerned. It is quite pos- sible that in the early stage of presbyopia a 72 inch glass may be sufficient, and if found to be so, it should by all means be preferred to a higher number; but, practically speaking, a 48 inch is that most usually required, because persons in this country seldom seek assistance until the presbyopia has advanced beyond the aid of a 72 inch glass. It has been recom- mended to calculate the requirements of the eye by the age of the individual, but this is fallacious, as eyes differ much in their natural powers of vision, and not less in the amount of assistance they need. The only true mode of obtaining suitable spectacles is by absolute trial. Persons should not be satisfied with a hasty trial of glasses in an optician's shop, for the eyes soon become excited and confused, rendering it impossible to arrive at a correct decision. It is fiir better to select two or three pairs of spectacles which are near the mark, and to test them leisurely at home. Those to be selected should simply give black- ness and distinctness to the letters of a book, and enable a person to read or work at the natural distance with perfect comfort ; such glasses supply to the eyes precisely that amount of refractive power in which they are deficient. Cylindrical Eye. — This peculiarity of the organ of vision was first investigated and ex- plained by the present Astronomer Royal. It depends on the curvature of the cornea being greater in the vertical plane than the hori- zontal, whereby the rays are refracted to a nearer focus in a vertical than in a horizontal plane ; this gives rise to much confusion of1408 VISION. vision, a point appearing a line, a circle an oval, and a square a parallelogram. In an in- teresting case related by Dr. Robert Hamil- ton*, the patient, when looking at a clock, was unable to distinguish the hands if they pointed perpendicularly, as at six o'clock, but if hori- zontally he had no difficulty : so when looking at a wheel at a little distance, the horizontal spokes only could be seen. The patient was a coach painter by trade, and this peculiarity of vision greatly interfered with his business, for he could not draw vertical lines with any degree of correctness, and unwittingly made them slanting, a serious fault in heraldic de- vices ; horizontal lines he drew with perfect precision. His method of correcting the per- ceptions of perpendicular lines was to bend his head at right angles with his body, where- upon upright bodies became distinct and accu- rately represented. This man also practised a manoeuvre which forcibly reminds us of an act common to persons having conical corneae, that of placing the fore-finger at the outer angle of the eyelids and drawing them out- wards whereby vision is improved. To remedy the defect under which he laboured, Professor Airey made a pin-hole in a blackened card, which he caused to slide on a graduated scale ; then strongly illuminating a sheet of paper and holding the card between it and the eye, he had a lucid point on which he could make observations with ease and exactness. Then resting the end of the scale on the cheek bone he found that the point at the distance of 6 inches appeared a very well- defined line inclined to the vertical about 35° and subtending an angle of 2°. Again, at the distance of 2>\ inches, it appeared a well-defined line at right angles with the former, and of the same apparent length. It was therefore neces- sary to make a lens which, when the parallel rays were incident, should cause them to diverge in one plane from the distance of 3J and in the other plane from the distance of 6 inches. The professor obtained a lens of which the radius of the spherical surface was 3^ inches, of the cylindrical 44, inches, and with this he was able to read the smallest print. In Dr. Hamilton's patient the relation of the horizontal to the vertical focus appeared to be as 5i inches to 6^ inches, and on trying him with plano-concave cylindrical lenses, it was found that a lens of 24 inches focal length, the cylindrical surface being made to act ho- rizontally, operated very beneficially. Besides this irregular refraction the man was myopic, but the lenses in question fitted as spectacles, enabled him to see well. The defect of the cylindrical eye may be de- tected by making a small pinhole in a card which is to be moved from close to the eye to arm's length, the eye meanwhile being directed to the sky, or any bright object of sufficient size. With ordinary eyes the indistinct image of the hole remains circular at all distances, but to an eye having this peculiar delect it be- comes elongated, and when the card is at a * Monthly Journal of Medical Science, June 1847. certain distance passes into a straight line. On further removing the card the image he- comes elongated in the perpendicular direc- tion, and finally if the eye be not too long-sighted, passes into a straight line per- pendicular to the former. Professor Stokes has invented a highly ingenious instrument for determining the nature of the required lens, and the following is the proposition on which it is based. Conceive a lens ground with two cylindrical surfaces of equal radius, one concave and the other convex, with their axes crossed at right angles ; call such a lens an astigmatic lens : let the reciprocal of its focal length in one of the principal planes be called its j'ower, and a line parallel to the axis of the convex surface its astigmatic axis. Then if two thin astig- matic lenses be combined with their axes inclined at any angle, they will be equivalent to a third astigmatic lens determined by the following construction. From any point draw two straight lines representing in magnitude the powers of the respective lenses, and inclined to a fixed line drawn arbitrarily in a direction perpendicular to the axis of vision at angles equal to twice the inclinations of their astigmatic axes, and complete the parallelogram. Then the two lenses will be equivalent to a single astigmatic lens represented by the diagonal of the pa- rallelogram in the same way in which the single lenses are represented by the sides. A piano-cylindrical or spherico-cylindrical lens is equivalent to a common lens, the power of which is equal to the semi-sum of the reciprocals of the focal lengths in the two principal planes, combined with an astigmatic lens, the power of which is equal to their semi-difference. If two piano-cylindrical lenses of equal radius, one concave and the other convex, be fixed one in the lid and the other in the body of a small round wooden box, with a hole in the top and bottom, so as to be as nearly as possible in contact, the lenses will neutralise each other when the axes of the surfaces are parallel; and by merely turning the lid round, an astigmatic lens may be formed of a power varying con- tinuously from zero to twice the astigmatic power of either lens. When a person who has the defect in question has turned the lid till the power suits his eye, an extremely simple numerical calculation, the data of which are furnished by the chord of double the angle through which the lid has been turned, enables him to calculate the curva- ture of the cylindrical surface of a lens for a pair of spectacles which will correct the defect in his eye.* A curious case is related in the Annates d'Oculistique f, of an anomaly of vision, which was probably the consequence of a defect in the form of the cornea, such as that under consideration. M. Schnyder, the Pastor of Menzberg in the Canton of Lucerne, * Report of the British Association, vol. xviii. f Tom. xxi. p. 222.VITAL STATISTICS. 1469 was presbyopic for horizontal lines and myopic for vertical. This he remedied by wearing spectacles the glasses of which were cylindric bi-convexes, with rectilinear, hori- zontal and similar axes. These glasses obvi- ated the presbyopia relative to the horizontal lines, and they were combined with sphero- biconcave lenses to get rid of the myopia for vertical lines. Each of the glasses was made moveable for facility of cleaning. The following means are recommended to ascertain if an eye has the defect now de- scribed. The person should attentively con- template for some time and with attention a cross, three or four lines in size, made of fine wire and fixed in a frame. If affected, he will see the horizontal lines differ in thickness and blackness of tint from the vertical. To determine the focal length which the lenses should have, a person whose sight is presbyopic in one direction should take bi- sphero-convex lenses which enable him to see distinctly at the ordinary distance the lines which otherwise appear indistinct: he can deduce the focal distance of the cylindrico- convex glasses. A person myopic in one direction should do the same with regard to bi-sphero-concave lenses. The convex glasses should be chosen of one or two numbers stronger.

VITAL STATISTICS.—The duration of human life, with a consideration of the princi- pal causes by which it may be lengthened or curtailed, is a subject which evidently belongs both to the domain of physiology and to that of statistics. It belongs to physiology, in- asmuch as the duration of human life "is the final effect of the operation of natural causes brought to bear on the healthy human frame ; and it belongs to statistics, whether we use that term in the less exact sense of a branch of human knowledge largely indebted to the use of numbers, or in the more accurate sense of a department of science, having an im- portant bearing on the interests of the public* In this place it is proposed to take only a limited view of the subject of Vital Sta- tistics, and to examine the scientific methods which have been suggested and employed for determining the true duration of human life in communities and classes of men ; in other * For some remarks on the true meaning of the term "Statistics," see Statistics, Medical, note p. 803. ■H70 VITAL STATISTICS. words, to do for this important branch of statistics what has been done elsewhere for the statistical or numerical method * Having already insisted on the precautions to be ob- served in the use of numbers as a scientific instrument, it remains to determine the pre- cise value of those measures of the duration of life which are in common use for scientific and practical purposes. On a superficial view of the subject, it might seem sufficient, in order to determine the mean age attained by a given class of persons exposed to a given class of influence?, to collect the ages, at death, of a certain number of persons belonging to that class, to add those ages together, and to divide the sum by the number of persons. But it must be evident, on further consideration, that an average so obtained may furnish a very im- perfect measure of the longevity of the class, and of the force of the influences brought to bear upon the individuals of whom it is com- posed. In order to build up a science of Vita! Statistics — in other words, in order to deter- mine the true influence of external agents on the duration of human life, we must make use of such materials as happen to be ready to our hands. These materials do not always present themselves in the same shape, nor do they all possess the same value. Sometimes they are simple averages ; at other times they are complex calculations based upon the same, or similar facts, but moulded into new forms by means of certain necessary corrections. A few preliminary observations on these mate- rials will be found to answer several useful purposes. They will serve, at one and the same lime, as a test of the value of the prin- ciples sought to be established, and as a check to the tendency with which the statist is often reproached to exaggerate the value of inferences drawn from numerical data. Several methods are in use for measuring the duration of human life. Of these, the best known and most commonly employed are the following: — 1. The mean age at death ; 2. The rate of mortality; 3. The expectation of life ; 4. The mean duration of life ; and 5. The probable duration of life. Other terms, such as the specific intensity of life, and other methods, such as the ages of the living, are occasionally employed. 1. The mean age at death. — The mean, or average age at death, is the sum of the ages at death, divided by the number of deaths. Thus, if five persons die at the respective ages of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60, their mean, or t , ' , . 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 00, average age at death is ' ■ = : or 40 years ; and if a second group of five persons die at the respective ages of 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80, their mean age at death is 20 + 35 + 50 + 05 + 80 , ,n v ... ! ! ' 1 ' or 50 years. JNow, it 5 J these two groups of five persons were each exposed during their lives to a peculiar set of * See Statistics, Medical, p. 801. influences, the mean age which they respec- tively attained would be a measure of the force of those influences. But such a mea- sure would be open to the serious objection that the number of facts from which the averages are calculated is insufficient. Let us, however, suppose this objection to be set aside by increasing the number of deaths in each case to several hundreds or thousands, so as to embrace either the entire number of deaths of the classes submitted to comparison, or such a considerable proportion of deaths taken without selection as would give satis- factory results in accordance with the strictest requirements of the numerical method, the question still presents itself, Is the mean age at death a safe measure and standard of com- parison ? The answer to this question must be in the negative. The mean age at death is not always a safe and sound standard. Its employment would often lead to very erro- neous inferences. It will therefore be neces- sary to discriminate between those cases in which it may be employed with safety, and those in which its use would lead to fallacious results. The mean age at death can be employed with safety as a true test or measure only in those cases in which the calculation purport- ing to embrace an entire class of persons, every member of that class is included, or in which the calculations embracing only a sec- tion of an entire class, the class in question is retained in a state of perfect uniformity during the whole time comprised in the calculation. According to the first supposition, we take a given number (say 100,000) of children born in a given year, and trace them through life till they are all dead, summing up their ages at death, and dividing by the number of deaths. According to the second supposition, we ex- tract from some register of deaths the ages of all who die during some term of years, having ascertained, by referring to the census, that the population has continued stationary (that is to say, constantly gaining as many by fresh births as it loses by death), during the time over which the calculations extend. The same reasoning will be found to apply to the mean age at death, taken as a measure of the true duration of life of the members of any handicraft, trade, or profession. It can only be a true measure so long as the blanks caused by death are fiiled by new recruits, entering at the same age as the age of entrance of the deceased. In all other cases but those now specified, the mean age at death is a more or less fallacious measure of the true duration of life. As the mean age at death has been lately revived as a measure of the duration of human life, and a test of the sanitary condition of the population, though its fallaciousness was long since recognised and pointed out by the early constructors of life-tables, it may be well to devote some space to a statement of the cases in which the proposed test is most open to objection. a. The mean age at death has been employed as a test of the sanitary condition of a nation,VITAL STATISTICS. J 471 and as a measure of that condition when com- pared with another nation, or with the same nation at another time, in ignorance or for.- getfulness of the well-ascertained fact that the living population of one nation may differ very widely in its composition from the living population of another, and that the elements of the population of the same nation may- undergo very extensive changes even in a short term of years. In illustration of the first of these state- ments, it will suffice to instance the strongly- contrasted populations of England and Ame- rica, of which the first has 46 and the second 54 in the hundred under 20 years of age, the number above 20 being, of course, reversed. In the two populations of Denmark and Sar- dinia, on the other hand, the relative pro- portions at different ages are very nearly the same ; and, when expressed in round numbers, for long intervals of age, identical. As a general rule, however, there is considerable difference between one population and another in the proportion of persons living at the same ages. In support of the second of these statements, the change which took place in the population of England in the interval from 1821 to 1841 may be adduced. At the former period, the persons living under 20 years of age were 49 per cent, of the whole population, but in 1811 they had fallen to 46 per cent. There is no room for doubt, therefore, that different populations vary in their composition, and that the same population may, in course of time, undergo considerable changes, and exhibit very striking contrasts in the number of persons living at different ages. Such being the case, it will not be difficult to prove that the differences in question do so materially affect the mean age at death as to rob it of its alleged value as a test or measure of the sanitary condition of nations. We have only to suppose the young population of America transferred to England, and exposed to the same causes of death as determine the duration of life of its own inhabitants, in order to be fully convinced of the fallacious- ness of this test. Now, according to the rate of mortality prevailing in England, little more than half its inhabitants die before com- pleting their 20th year, and somewhat less than half after that age. If the mean age of all who die under 20 years of age be taken at 5 years, and of all who die above 20 at 60 years, the mean age at death of fifty persons dying out of the respective populations of England and America, will be about 34 and 30 years. These numbers, however, though correctly calculated from the rough data just assumed, diverge much less widely than the true re- sults, for the actual mean age at death, which is 29 years in England, is only 20 years in America.* So that two populations, subject to the same law of mortality, and losing the same number of persons at the same ages, in * See an essay by F.G. P. Neison, Esq. in the 7th volume of the Journal of the Statistical Society. consequence of the different constitution of their respective populations, may have a widely different mean age at death. Similar results to those obtained by comparing Eng- land and America are arrived at if we compare England in 1821 with England in 1841. The mean age at death, which in 1821 was 25 years, became in 1841, owing to the change in the population already referred to, 29 years.* If any further illustration of the fallacy of the mean age at death, when used as a test of the sanitary state of nations, were required, it might be found in its failure when applied to coun- tries of which the true position in the sanitary- scale has been ascertained by the application of unexceptionable tests. The three nations, England, France, and Sweden, for example, occupy the following relative position :— 1. England. 2. France. 3. Sweden. But if the mean age at death were taken as our guide, they would rank as follows:— 1. France. 2. Sweden. 3. England. The mean age at death being 34 for France, 31 for Sweden, and only 29 for England, t b. The mean age at death has been em- ployed as a measure of the relative sanitary condition of English counties, cities, and towns, of town and country, and of the several districts of large cities. To show the fallacy of the method as so applied, it will suffice to prove that the populations thus compared are composed of different elements. Taking, as before, the number living below 20 years of age as an illustration, it appears that while there are 47 in the hundred under 20 in Essex and Suffolk, there are only 44 in the hundred under 20 in Staffordshire ; that for 47 in the hundred in Leeds, 46 in Sheffield and Birmingham, and 44 in Manchester, there are only 42 in Liverpool, 41 in Exeter, and 40 m London ; and, lastly, that the popu- lation under 20 years of age, which amounts to 47 per cent, in Bethnal Green falls as low as 41 in Clerkenwell, 40 in Kensington, 36 in St. Giles's and Marylebone, and 31 in St. George's, Hanover Square. The effect of this variable distribution of the population on the mean age at death is very well marked, and is placed in a very s'riking light by sup- posing the population of the metropolis to be transferred to some of these counties and cities, and to be exposed to the influences for good or evil which are brought to bear on the duration of life of their actual populations. Thus, if the population of London, of which 40 per cent, are under 20 years of age, were to be transferred to the county of Hereford, The exact age, deduced from the rough data as- sumed in the text, will be as follows: 4fi '4. England, — x 5+~*x60=115-j-1620=1735, which, di- vided by 50, gives 31-7 as the average age. America, iix 5 +1^x60 =135 + 1330=1515, which, di- 2 2 vided by 50, gives 30 3 as the average age. * For the facts on which these comparisons are founded, see an essay in the 6th vol. of the Journal of the Statistical Society. By G. R. Porter, Esq. + See the 6th annual Report of the Registrar General, p. 572,1473 VITAL STATISTICS. where the average age at death is nearly 38^ years, the mean age at death would become 30i years, or a year and a halt' in excess of the mean age at death of the existing inhabit- ants of London. The advantage, therefore, which the county of Hereford enjoys over the metropolis, in a sanitary point of view, instead of being represented by the difference between 381 and 29 years, or 9| years, is really not more than a year and a half. Again, the average age at death in the metropolis is 29 years, and in Sheffield 23 years ; but if the population of the metropolis were transferred to Sheffield, the average age at death would be 28 years. So that the difference of 6 years, which, according to this test of the mean age at death, marks the sanitary su- periority of London over Sheffield, dwindles, under this very obvious correction, to one year. If we apply the same correction to the several districts of the metropolis, we obtain similar results. Bethnal Green is the district in which the mean age at death is lowest, while in Kensington it attains its maximum. In Bethnal Green the mean age at death is 26, in Kensington 32. But the population of Bethnal Green transferred to Kensington, would have a mean age at death of 27 years; so that in this case also a difference of six years in favour of the more aristocratic quarter dwindles down to one year. In some cases the use of this corrective actually re- verses the position of the two populations submitted to comparison. Thus, the mean aire at death in the united parishes of St. Giles's and St. George's Bloomsbury is 28 years, and in Bethnal Green, as has just been stated, 26 ; but transfer the population of Bethnal Green to St. Giles's, and the mean age at death becomes 24 years. The application, therefore, of this correction completely alters the relative position of the two parishes, so that the parish which, when tested by the mean age at death, seemed the healthiest, proves to be the most unhealthy. Serious errors and exaggerations have also been committed in comparing the smaller districts of our large towns with each other. The meanest and most squalid districts are as naturally the resort of those who marry early, and of those who are sunk into poverty by the burden of large families of young children, as better districts are the abodes of the more prudent and least encumbered members of society. The lowest districts of the large towns of England are also the resort of that part of our population which indulges most habitually in intemperance, and in all the habits that engender poverty, misery, and disease. It is, therefore, inevitable that in comparing the worst districts with those of a somewhat better class, we should be comparing popula- tions containing a large proportion of persons liable to a high mortality for reasons other than the insalubrity of the districts themselves with those containing a smaller proportion. c. The mean age at death has also been used to test the sanitary condition of different classes of persons inhabiting the same town or town district. A very extensive series of tables, for instance, has been compiled, in which the mean age at death of the gentry, tradesmen, artisans, and paupers of the several parishes of the metropolis is represented, and used as a measure of their sanitary condition.* The parish of St. James's, Westminster, in which the class termed gentry is more likely to be appropriately named than in the poorer and less fashionable parishes, may be con- veniently taken as an example. In this parish the average age at death, children included, is 42 for gentry, 26 for tradesmen, 21 for artisans, &c, and 49 for paupers. The differ- ences are here so extraordinary, as only to admit of explanation on the supposition of a vast disproportion between the numbers living at the same ages in the several classes. If the element of age in the living is disregarded in comparing the gentry with the artisans out of the workhouse, it must equally be dis- regarded in contrasting the gentry with the paupers in the workhouse, who are drawn chiefly from the artisan class. The difference between 49 (the mean age at death of paupers), and 42 (the mean age at death of the gentry) is obviously due to the greater average age of the inmates of the workhouse, as the differ- ence between 42 (the mean age at death of the gentry), and 21 (the mean age at death of artisans), is traceable mainly, if not wholly, to the great disparity in the ages of the living members of the two classes. Unfortunately we are not yet in a condition to apply to the mean age at death of these classes of the population, the same correction which, when applied to counties, cities, and city districts, served in so striking a manner to equalize the results. The ages of the living members of the several classes of society is still an impor- tant desideratum. The tables under consider- ation also give the mean age at death of gentry, tradesmen, artisans, and paupers dying after 21 years of age. In the parish of St. James's, Westminster, the mean ages at death of these classes are 57, 51, 4G, and 58 respectively. The differences, though less considerable, are still at total variance with the results of the most accurate inquiries into the value of life of the same classes of society f, and only admit of explanation by supposing a great disparity in the ages of their living members, together with an erroneous method of se- lection and classification. (I. The mean age at death has also been employed to test the sanitary state of different * These Tables are published in the same volume (vol. vii.) of the Journal of the Statistical Society, which contains Mr. Neison's valuable essay just quoted. They form part of a paper by Mr. Chad- wick, " On the best Modes of representing accu- rately by Statistical Returns the Duration of Life, and the Pressure and Progress of the Causes of Mortality among different Classes of the Commu- nity, and amongst the Populations of different Districts and Countries." f See especially, Contributions to Vital Statistics, by F. G. P. Neison, in which the artisan class is shown to occupy a much more favourable position in the sanitary scale, than had previously been supposed.1473 VITAL STATISTICS. classes of society, and of the members of different professions, without reference to their place of residence. But little objection can be made to this test when applied with ordinary precaution. If the earliest age ad- mitted into the tabular abstracts, from which the averages are calculated, is the same in all the classes submitted to comparison ; if during the time over which the observations extend the classes compared with each other have received no rapid accession of numbers; and if the deaths are those of the whole body of the profession or trade (or, if of a section only, then of a similar section in every case), the mean age at death will constitute a fair measure of the relative sanitary condition of the several classes in question. But if, on the other hand, two professions or occupations are compared, in which the age at entry is not the same; or the one is stationary in point of numbers, while the other is rapidly increasing; or if the whole body is taken in the one case, and only the senior or junior members in the other, the results will be quite unworthy of confidence. Some of the greatest misapprehensions existing with respect to the duration of life of certain classes of the community, are traceable to the selection of the senior members of a class to represent the entire class to which they belong. Nothing is more common, for instance, than to hear royal families, or the members of the aristocracy, or the clergy, or the army, spoken of as long-lived, on the strength of the advanced ages attained by kings, peers, archbishops, or general officers. In making a selection of the more conspicuous members of the class, the significant fact is overlooked that they are also the oldest members, and that they do not attain their exalted rank till a period of life greatly in advance of that at which they entered their several professions. The mean age, at death, for example, of archbishops and bishops of the established church, is upwards of 71 years, but the mean age at death of the whole body of the clergy is about 64 years. A similar disparity would be found to exist be- tween the peers and the whole body of the aristocracy, and between general officers in the army, and admirals in the navy, and the whole body of officers in the two branches of the public service. The tables already referred to as comparing the four classes of gentry, tradesmen, artisans, and paupers in the several districts of the metropolis, supply analogous examples of erroneous selection and classification. In the great majority of the metropolitan parishes, for instance, there is no class of gentry properly so called; but this class consists, with the exception of a few professional men not im- properly mixed up with it, of tradesmen who have retired from business long enough to be entered in the mortuary registers as gentle- men. On the other hand, the pauper class is very largely recruited from the ranks of the artisans and labourers, and contains a very considerable proportion of old persons who, being no longer able to earn their liveli- hood, have come upon the public for support. The mean age of the living has been occa- sionally resorted to as a test or measure of salubrity. It has been assumed that a low average age of the living members of a class, when compared with the average age of ano- ther class, arises, cceteris paribus, from a high mortality leading to a quick addition of young members. This assumption is justified only in those cases in which the addition of young members can he shoun not to arise from any other cause, such as an increased demand for members of the class in question. It is there- fore a test to be employed with great caution; and it will also be necessary to show that the age of admission of the classes subject to com- parison is the same, or open only to very slight variation. 2. The rate of mortality. — The mortality, or rate of mortality, is the number of deaths which takes place in a given population, in a given space of time. The calculation is gene- rally made for a year, so that the ratio comes to express the number of the living out of which one will die annually. The ratio is sometimes stated as a fraction, and sometimes as a percentage proportion. If, for in- stance, out of a living population of 100,000, two thousand deaths take place every year, Too.wi7> 01" 3Jo> or ^ per cent, is the mortality, or rate of mortality, to which that population is exposed. In estimating the value of this test, it is necessary to bear in mind that the rate of mortality varies for every year of life. It follows, therefore, as a natural consequence, that the rate of mortality, like the mean age at death, must be materially influenced by the ages of the living population. In a po- pulation containing a large proportion of young children, subject to a very high mor- tality, the aggregate rate of mortality for the entire population will be necessarily higher than in a population abounding in older per- sons and having a comparatively small number of children. But a very cursory examination of tables of mortality will convince us that the error attaching to the rate of mortality as a test or measure of the sanitary condition of a population is much less than that which is inherent in the mean age at death ; for not only do the extremes of lite approximate much more closely to each other in their respective rates of mortality than in the mean ages at death, but ages which, though less widely separated, are far enough apart to affect the mean age at death, are exhibited as subject to a mortality very nearly identical. From 5 to 10 years of age, for example, the rate of mortality, in the male population of England, is '970 per cent., and from 20 to 30 years of age "974 per cent.; so that, while out of 100,000 persons dying at the respective ages of 5—10 and 20— 30*, 970 and 974 persons would die in the year, their age at death would count in the one case as something between 5 and 10, and in the other at some age between 2i» and 30. The difference in the rate of mor- 5 BVITAL STATISTICS. 1474 tality would be almost nothing, while the dif- ference in the age would amount to about 20 years. So also if we compare individual years instead of terms of years. The mor- tality at 10 years is -791 per cent., at 20 years •784 per cent. ; at 11 years it is -702 per cent., at 18 years .709 per cent. The rate of mor- tality differs very slightly in the ages brought under comparison, while the mean age at death differs by 10 and 7 years respectively. These a priori reasonings are fully borne out by the results of actual comparison. In one of the reports of the Registrar General * the expectation of life (which will be presently shown to be the true test or measure of the sanitary state of a population), the mortality, and the mean age at death, for six different populations, are compared with each other, with what result the following table will show. Expectation of life, in years: — Surrey, 45 ; England, 41; France, 40; Sweden, 39; Metro- polis, 37 ; Liverpool, 20. Rate of mortality, or one death in— Surrey, 52; England, 41; France, 42; Sweden, 41; Metropolis, 39 ; Liverpool, 30. Mean age at death, in years: — Surrey, 34; France, 34; Sweden, 31; England, 29; Me- tropolis, 29; Liverpool, 21. The rate of mortality, then, keeps pace with the expectation of life, to such an extent, at least, as to place the six communities in the same relative position ; while, according to the mean age at death, the nations which stand third, fourth, and fifth on the list suffer transposition, France and Sweden taking rank before England in the scale of salubrity, and England, which holds, of right, the second place immediately after her own county of Surrey, is made to descend to the fourth rank. When compared, therefore, with an accurate measure of the duration of human life, the rate of mortality shows itself more worthy of confidence than the mean age at death. Nevertheless, for reasons already assigned, it must not be looked upon as altogether free from objection, and must, in every case, be regarded as of inferior value to the test next to be considered, name!}',— 3. The expectation of life. — The expectation of life, or the mean future life-time, is the mean number of years which, at any given age, the members of a community, taken one with another, may expect to live. This ex- pectation is embodied in those series of cal- culations which are technically known as life- tables, and which are so largely in use in the important operations of life-assurance. When correctly calculated, they are based on the two concurrent series of facts, the numbers and ages of the living and the numbers and ages of the dying, and they therefore comprise the two elements necessary to perfect ac- curacy. When based upon the ages of the dying alone, they are open to nearly the same objection as those which apply to the mean age at death. The following is an abbreviation of the English life-table, which will be found given * Sixth Annual Report, p. 572. at length for any year of life from birth to 95 years of age in the fifth annual report of the Registrar General.* Age.

The mean duration of life, the mean life, the mean life-time, or vie moyenne, is found by adding the age to the expectation of life. Thus the mean duration of life at 5 years of age is 5+49*64 for boys, and 5+50*38 for girls, or 54*64 for boys and 55*38 for girls ; at 10 years of age the mean duration of life is, for boys and girls respectively, 10+47*08 and 10+47*81, or 57*08 and 57*81; and at 30 years of age 30+ 33* 13 or 63*13, and 30 + 34*25 or 64*25. The mean duration of life differs from the mean age at death, inasmuch as the one is a calculation based on all the deaths taking place, after a given age, in the members of a community traced through life, while the other is founded upon such deaths as happen to be noted in a community which has been undergoing continual disturbance by births, immigration, and emigration. 5. The probable duration of life, probable life-time, equation of life, or vie probable, is the age at which a number of children born into the world will be reduced one-half, so that the chance is equal of their dying before or after that age. Thus it has been ascertained that out of 51,274 males and 48,726 females (making up together the number of 100,000 infants) at birth, 25,637 males will die between the 45th and 46th year, or at about 45^ years of age, and 24,363 females between the 47th and 48th year, or at about 47i years ; so that the equation of life or probable life-time of males at birth is 45£ years, and of females * Report, p. xix.VITAL STATISTICS. 1475 5 b 2 47i years. The same terms (probable life- time, equation of life, or vie probable) are also employed in speaking of persons who have attained more or less advanced ages. Thus the probable duration of life of a female at 25 years of age is about +1 years, being her actual age added to the number of years required to reduce the females living at that age to one half. In like manner the probable duration of life of a male aged CO years is 73 years, being his age added to the 13 years required to reduce himself and his contemporaries to one half their number. The term " specific intensity" has also been used as a measure of the value of life. It represents the number living at any given age, divided by the number dying at that age. For example, if, at the age of 44, 72,709 male survivors of the population of Eng- land and Wales, out of 100,000 born into the world, lose by death 990, the specific intensity is ^-flg- or 73475, while for the number of 72,190 female survivors losing 923 of their number, the specific intensity is '-?;;} |°, or 78".i09. Females, therefore, have a higher intensity of life at 43 years of age than males ; in other words, they suffer from a less mor- tality.* Such are some of the principal methods which have been recommended or employed for ascertaining the true duration of human life,— a branch of statistical inquiry which has received large contributions of late years, many of which, however, are unfortunately rendered altogether valueless by the omission from the calculations of some elements ne- cessary to precision, but not yet obtainable.

This term is usually applied to those sounds which animals produce by means of the air traversing their organs of voice, such as we observe in mammalia, birds, reptiles, and in some insects. The human voice is susceptible of several mollifications, such as timbre or quality, in- tensity, and pitch ; including those successive transitions of tone from one pitch to another which constitute melody. The organs of voice comprise the thorax with the muscles * See Contributions to Vital Statistics. By F. G. P. Neison, F. L.

Ed.] of respiration, the lungs, trachea, larynx, pharynx, mouth, tongue, nasal cavities, nerves, and blood-vessels. Of these, the thorax and lungs may be considered an air-chest or beLows, the trachea a pvrte-vent or air-pipe, ami the glottis a complex iecd. The trachea varies in length and diameter with the age and sex of individuals, until they arrive at the adult period of life. By its structure the trachea is endowed with elasticity, together with the power of longitudinal extension and relaxation, and of increasing or diminishing in diameter : the acoustic effect of these pro- perties will presently be investigated. The sum of the areas of the two bronchi is greater than that of the trachea ; by which adaptation the latter is more readily supplied with air during the vocalization of the breath. In all mammalia, birds, and reptiles, the axes of the bronchi are inclined to that of the trachea at a greater or less angle. With reference to the voice, the larynx is the most important organ in the whole apparatus. The mouth, fauces, tongue, and nasal organs are not necessary to the production of voice ; nevertheless they exer- cise a considerable influence on its quality, and are indispensable for the production of arti- culate language. The thorax is sufficiently capacious to contain as much air after a full inspiration as will sustain the glottis in a state of vibration, when the tone is of mo- derate intensity, during the space of fifteen seconds, which will enable a person to pro- nounce in rapid succession from thirty to forty monosyllables at one expiration.* The phenomena of the voice of animals must at a very early period have afforded to physiologists proof of the susceptibility of membranous structures to enter into a state of vibration; and it is now generally known that membranes, whether twisted into a cord like the string of a violin, or in the form of a parallelogram stretched in one direction as the vocal ligaments, or in that of discs stretched all round as the head of a drum, are all capable of producing musical sounds when properly excited. The theory of the vibratory movements of stretched membranous surfaces has occupied the attention of many of the most celebrated mathematicians, such as Euler, Bernoulli, Riccati, Biot, Poisson, Sir John Herschel, and others. It is a subject requiring the most profound analysis, and the solution of pro- blems of much greater complexity than those either of strings or bars ; but in order to bring the theory of vibrating membranes within the reach of computation, the membranes are supposed to be homogeneous and of equal thickness and elasticity. Now this hypo- thesis will not satisfy the conditions of the vibratory movements of the vocal organs, such as the windpipe for example, which is composed of tissues of variable thickness, density, and elasticity; it would therefore be * For the anatomy of the human larynx, reference is made to the article Larynx.1476 VOICE. futile in the present state of the science of acoustics to attempt any mathematical solu- tion of the laws of the equilibrium and move- ments of the heterogeneous masses of the vocal tube. When, however, a membrane is stretched in one direction only, it obeys the same laws as a string. Fig. 890. An outline of the transverse section of the Human Larynx.

Having adapted two laminae of India rubber to a pipe connected with the bellows of an organ, M. Biot caused a current of air to pass over their free edges, by which means he obtained with facility sounds of different pitch. Professor Willis made similar expe- riments with leather and caoutchouc, but could not produce with these substances so great a range of tones as the glottis will yield, and therefore concluded that the vocal ligaments possess greater elasticity. Mr. Willis has also investigated the position in which it is necessary that membranous laminae should be placed, in order that they may be excited and sustained in a state of vibration. He has likewise given a satisfactory explana- tion of the mode of action of the air on reeds, such as those of the organ pipe, which applies also to free reeds, and every other case where a vibratory motion is maintained by a current of air. The experiments and theory of Mr. Willis are exceedingly important, for lie has shown that in ordinary breathing the vocal cords remain inclined to each other, at an angle which prevents any vibratory motion ; whereas when their surfaces lie in the same plane, the breath immediately excites them into a state of vibration ; the natural position of the vocal cords in these two states is seen in (fig. 890). Miiller also made some experiments on stretched membranous bands, both isolated, and in connection with a tube ; from which he concludes that the iorce of the current of air influences the pitch of the note produced; so that a strong current will produce a more acute tone than a weak one, and vice versa ; but the author has not found this to be the case in any of the experiments which he has made. To obtain a pure quality of tone when two membranous bands are stretched across a tube, it is necessary that they should be of equal weight and length, and subjected to equal tension, otherwise they cannot vibrate freely in equal periods of time. Ac- cording to Cagniard De la Tour, if two mem- branous lamina? of equal length and weight be stretched by unequal forces, so that there is an interval of a fifth between the notes they yield separately, the note resulting from their combined action is the intervening third. Miiller is disposed to doubt the accuracy of De La Tour, but his own views do not differ ma- terially from those of the latter, as he says that when one tongue is most readily thrown into vibrations by the current of air, the sound is emitted by it alone, but if the blast is such that it throws them both into motion, they may both vibrate together, and by reciproca- tion produce a simple sound intermediate between the fundamental note of the two vibrating separately ; they may also emit two distinct sounds, or the blast being modified, the two sounds may be produced in suc- cession. From these researches it appears, that membranous lamina?, stretched in imi- tation of the thyro-arytenoid ligaments, will not only vibrate readily, but produce a range of musical tones. It has been remarked that sounds are most readily produced when the two laminae are stretched in the same plane, and that a smaller volume of air is required the nearer the edges of the lamina? approach each other, and a still smaller one when their edges actually touch. De Kempelen states, that to produce sound, the edges of the glottis must be approximated to within -JL. or at least of an inch. These experi- ments upon artificial vibrating tongues per- fectly agree with those the author has made on the larynxes of animals. Owing to the nature of the articulation of the thyroid with the cricoid cartilage, and the manner in which the crico-thyroid muscles act, an equal ten- sion of both the thyro-arytenoid ligaments is simultaneously secured, supposing the aryte- noid cartilages to be at the same time in corresponding positions, which is a necessary condition for the production of a synchronous vibratory motion in the two lips of the glottis.VOICE. 1477 5 B 3 If the larynx of an animal be dissected out, and the vocal cords be stretched, they will vibrate like a piece of caoutchouc or leather in a current of air. In conducting these ex- periments, it is necessary to secure the same conditions as those which are required in the laminae above mentioned ; for instance, the inner edges of the glottis must be turned towards each other till they are in the same plane and parallel to one another before they will produce any sound ; hence we infer, that when the tension of the arytenoid ligaments takes place in the living animal, they turn upon their axes till their planes (which in the state of relaxation are inclined to the axis of the vocal tube) become perpendicular to it, and as the edges of the glottis approximate, and its think is nearly or entirely closed up, they acquire the true vibrating position. The production of the most simple tones of voice requires the associated actions of a most extensive range of organs ; and it is calculated that in the ordinary modulation of the voice, more than one hundred muscles are brought into action at the same time. The lungs having been first supplied with air by the act of inspiration, and the air in the chest and trachea having subsequently been condensed by the muscles of expiration, a portion of the edges of the glottis yields to its pressure, and is curved upwards, so as to form an angle with the axis (f the vocal tube, leaving between them a narrow aperture through which the air escapes. The tension and elasticity of the vocal ligaments tend to restore them to the plane of the vibrating position ; the air having been rarefied below the glottis during their elevation, becomes condensed on their depression, and the ne- cessary force is again accumuhited to re- elevate the vocal ligaments,and thus an oscilla- ting movement, consisting of a partial opening ami closing of the glottis, takes place, which being communicated to the contiguous air, the sounds of the voice are produced. The relative length of the vibrating edge of the glottis is regulated by the pressure of the column of air in the trachea, ami the resistance of the vocal ligaments. The intensity of the voice in the same medium, and under similar collateral circumstances, depends on the pressure of the column of air in the trachea, and the range of motion performed by the vibrating edges of the glottis. The vocal ligaments do not vary the pitch of the voice by their tension alone, but by their variations in length and tension conjointly. The author has learnt this from his own experiments on the vocal functions of the larynx, which have been confirmed both by Majendie and Mayo ; the former having observed in the larynx of a dog that a longer portion of the ligaments of the glottis vibrated during the utterance of grave tones, and that the length was dimi- nished as the tones became acute. The latter had an opportunity of inspecting the move- ments of the glottis in a man who had made an attempt to destroy himself by cutting his Fig. 891. The Head and 1~ocal Organs prepared for experi- ments. (After Midler.) The cervical vertebrae are removed, and the oeso- phagus opened behind the arytenoid cartilages, which are fixed together by a strong pin and ligature; the latter is brought through the open- ing, which is then firmly sewed together, and the lower opening of the oesophagus is also closed up. The larynx is laid bare, and the superior portion of the thyroid cartilage carefully removed so as not to injure the mucous membrane of the laiynx. The parts thus prepared are firmly fixed against the column, to which the arytenoid cartilages are also attached by the cord which binds them to- gether.

In this case the larynx was divided immediately above the vocal cords, and in consequence of the oblique direction of the wound, the arytenoid cartilage and the vocal cord on one side were injured. During respiration the glottis was observed to assume a triangular form, but when a sound was uttered, the chordae vocales became nearly parallel, and the rima glottidis of a linear form. The posterior part of the aperture did not appear to be closed. In a second case of this kind, he observed that the aryte- noid cartilages, as long as the vocalization of the breath continued, maintained the position which they had assumed when the glottis was closed entirely.* The vibrations of the thyroarytenoid ligaments are considered by Ferrein f to be analogous to those of strings ; hence he denominated these ligaments (though improperly) chordae vocales. He imagined that the longitudinal tension of these cords alone governed the pitch of the voice. Mr. Willis J has embraced the hypothesis of Ferrein ; he observes, that to obtain the various notes of the glottis, it is only ne- cessary to vary its longitudinal tension after the ligaments have been placed in the proper position , but M. Biot § remarks, " Qn'y a-t-il en effet dans la glotte qui ressemble a une corde vibrante? Comment pourroit-on en tirer jamais des sons d'un volume com- parable a ceux que l'homme produit ? Les plus simples notions d'acoustiques suffisent pour faire rejeter cette etrange opinion." On inspecting the larynx from above, we see two very nearly rectangular-shaped la- minae, one on each side of the chink of the glottis, but nothing resembling an isolated cord. The mucous membrane which lines the thyro-arytenoid ligaments (to which it closely adheres), as well as the rest of the vocal tube, must be considered as forming a part of the weight of the vibrating surface upon which the air acts ; the thyro-arytenoid ligaments confer on this membrane the re- quisite tension and resistance during vocaliza- tion, and it is this membrane which gives the sides of the glottis their laminated figure. The vocal ligaments, with their lining mem- brane, are stretched by the thyro-cricoid muscles, not all round like a drum, but in one direction only, namely, in that of their length, being attached on three sides, leaving one only free to vibrate. The vocal cords are, as has been seen, rectangular-shaped membranes, and from experiments made on the larynx after death by Ferrein, Miiller, and others (which the author has repeatedly verified), are found to vibrate like cylindrical cords ; we will therefore apply to the former the well-known formulae which regulate the vibrations of the latter. In cords composed of the same material, * Mayo, Outlines of Phvsiology, p. 991. t Memoires de l'Academie. 1741. p. 400. j Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, vol. iv. § Precis Elem. de Phys. torn. i. p. 898. and of uniform thickness, the time of a com- plete musical vibration, or double oscillation, is 1=2 2SP - ■ (I-) where / is the length of the cord, p its weight, P the force with which it is stretched, and g= 1 (j-jJj feet.

Owing to the elasticity of the thyroaryte- noid ligaments, their lengths, when in a state of repose, differ considerably from those which they present under the greatest tension. They differ also in the two sexes. In a series of experiments by Mailer, the differences of length were observed to be as represented in the following table, the figures of which are in inches and decimals of an inch. From these experiments it appears that the lengths of the male and female vocal cords in repose are nearly as 7 to 5, and in tension as 3 to 2. In boys at the age of fourteen, the length is to that of females after puberty as 6'25 to 7, so that the pitch of the voice is nearly the same. These experiments afford an idea, although an imperfect one, of the elasticity of the vocal ligaments. It has always been a subject of surprise, if the thyro-arj tenoid ligaments obey the laws of strings, how such short and narrow lamina; should produce such very grave tones as many bass singers are capable of uttering ; and this struck M. Biot as one of the circum- stances which in his opinion prove their mode of vibration to be unlike that of strings. He asks, " Ou pourroit-on trouver la place ne- cessaire pour donner a cette corde la longueur qu'exigent les sons les plus graves ?" Subjects of Experiment. Number of Experiments. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

Let us now investigate this phenomenon more closely, and endeavour to explain how such grave tones are produced by such extremely short membranes. Miiller has contrived several ingenious pieces of mechanism, seen in figs. 891, 892, and 893? by means of which he was enabled to estimate the amount of tension, lateral compression, and atmospheric pressure on the vocal cords, during the pro- duction of sound. In order to find the variations in the amount of condensation of air in the vocal organs in the production of sounds differing in pitch and intensity, the apparatus was furnished with a manometer (fig. 893, v). From that portion of the ex- periment which was confined to the investiga- tion of the effects produced by tension of the vocal, compared with that of musical cords, he obtained results which are recorded in the following table.

Miiller states that the numbers of vibra- tions in these experiments are not exactly in the direct ratio of the square roots of the stretch- ing forces, and that the weights 4, 16, 64, did not produce the octaves, but generally from a semitone to two or three tones lower. Now this result should have been anticipated ; but it does not seem to have occurred to him that whilst he increased the tension he at the same time increased the length, and we know (eq. 3.) that the number of vibrations in this */ tension , ease vanes as — , and eonse- 4/length of cord quently the numbers actually produced by the weights above mentioned ought (agreeably to Mailer's experiments) to be less than those which correspond with octaves. We see by the first experiment in the above table that the tension sufficient to produce 818 musical vibrations is 64 loths, or very nearly 33 ozs. If, therefore, we take the mean length of the vocal ligaments under the greatest tension at •91 of an inch, and substitute in equation (3.) their values for all known quantities, remem- bering that P represents the tension of one vocal cord, we shall find the weight of each ligament, viz. In an adult male I found that the two vocal ligaments, when divested of mucous mem- brane, weigh one grain, which is scarcely one- half their weight by theory; hence it appears that a considerable portion of mucous mem- brane is connected with the vocal cord in the production of sound, which agrees with the anatomy of these parts. It is now necessary to offer some explana- tion respecting the vital state of the vocal ligaments. The state of repose is the ordi- nary condition of the vocal ligament in the living subject, when the voice is not exercised ; but we must not therefore conclude it to be incapable of further contraction. In fact, the state of repose during life is a state of tension, for the ligaments being connected with the thyro-arytenoid muscles, not in a few points, but continuously throughout their whole length, must obey the motion of these muscles, which, like all other muscles, are in a state of tension during repose. We also know by experience that when we produce a sound lower than the usual pitch of our voice, the crico-thyroid chink is opened principally by the contraction of the same muscles, and the ligaments must therefore at the same time be relaxed. It appears, then, both from the anatomy and physiology ofthe human larynx, that the ordinary state of the vocal cords is one of considerable tension, which admits of being lessened, and thereby produces the range of lower notes. If we suppose the glottis to be partially closed when we are talking, that is, at the ordinary pitch of our voice, and to be more opened as the tones become graver, this of course will co-operate with the relaxation of the vocal cords. In the production of the higher notes, the crico- thyroid chink closes, and the thyro-arytenoid muscles, and consequently the ligaments, are elongated. Since, therefore, the vocal liga- ments have been proved to extend and con- tract for acute and grave tones respectively, and after death vibrate in a great measure like musical strings, we think it may be fairly inferred that they likewise obey, to a certain extent, during life, the laws of the vibrations of such strings, and that the con- clusions which we have derived from the foregoing formulas are not far removed from the truth. A further confirmation of these views may be derived from the following con- siderations. The length of a cord of invariable weight varies directiy as the tension, and in- versely as the square of the number of vibra- tions. Now, if we assume the length of the vocal cord, which gave G2$ under a tension of 32 loths to be -9I inch, which is the mean length of the male vocal cord in its greatest tension, according to the first table, and which gave the notes A1 C1, under the tension 8 and 2 loths respectively, the corresponding lengths of that cord, according to the formula, will be '83 inch and "58 inch*; but -58 inch is less than the least length in repose in the table. This result is, however, quite consis- tent with the theory here proposed ; because after death the thyro-arytenoid muscle be- comes of itself elongated, and consequently the vocal ligament attached to it, and there- fore the length of the ligament must be greater in this state than when it is in that which we have delined to be the state of repose before it has lost its vitality. In experiments made on the larynx by stretching the vocal ligaments with given weights, and by forcing a current of air through the glottis, care must be taken to keep the organs moist, and of the same temperature as they possess during life. The amount of condensation of the air in the vocal tube has been ascertained by Cagniard De la Tour, and Miiller, the former in the living, and the latter in the dead subject. In a person who had an opening in the windpipe after the operation of tracheotomy, Cagniard De la Tour found that the tension of the air in the vocal tube, while blowing the clarionet, was eqial to a column of water of thirty centimetres ja height, and that to produce a simple vocal sound in the same person a tension of sixteen centimetres was necessary. Miiller found that he could pro- duce sound in a larynx artificially by a tension of 3-4 centimetres; but for very loud sounds an increased tension was requisite. The dis- crepancy between the experiments of Cag- niard De la Tour and Miiller may be ascribed to the circumstance that the one operated on a/P p * N varies as —r= ;.'.

Variations in the hygrometric and thermo- metric states of the air exert very powerful influence on the pitch of the voice ; during the prevalence of a cold moist state of the atmosphere, especially in England, the voices of singers become lower by two or three notes, and regain their usual pitch when the air be- comes dry.* In thus tracing out the analogy be- tween the laws of stretched cords anil those of the vocal ligaments, it is not intended that those ligaments should be considered as stringed instruments, but only that this analogy is accurate as far as relates to the velocity with which an impulse is propagated along them. Dodart -j- supposed the tension of the vocal cords to be merely subservient to an altera- tion in the size of the aperture of the glottis, and that the difference of JT of a fibre of silk, or 3^ of a hair in the dimensions of that aperture, was sufficient to alter the pitch of the voice ; but this has been so completely refuted by more recent physiologists, and is so directly at variance with acoustic prin- ciples, that we need not give illustrations of its fallacy. M. Savart considered that the action of the air in its passage through the ventricles of the larynx, between the su- perior and inferior ligaments, is really the source of sound, and analogous to the me- chanism of the bird-call or dog-whistle. J There is certainly a great resemblance in the structure of that instrument to the space above mentioned in many of the higher ani- mals, which might easily have led to this in- genious hypothesis ; but, as we find neither superior ligaments nor ventricles of Morgagni 111 many of the order Ruminantia, in which the voice is very sonorous, this theory (as Miiller remarks) is untenable. We next come to the consideration of the alleged analogy between the action of the vocal ligaments and that of the reeds of mu- sical instruments. This opinion is maintained by MM. Biot, Cagniard De la Tour, Majendie, Malgaigne, Miiller, and several other distin- guished scientific men. It is opposed prin- cipally by M. Savart, who observes that the essential principle of the action of reeds con- sists in the periodical opening and shutting of the orifice through which the stream of air passes, but that this is wanting in the glottis ; and that were the latter a reed, the edges of the thyro-arytenoid ligaments which form the sides of the chink would be alternately forced asunder by the column of air in the larynx, and brought together by their tension ; whereas he found by experiment that air blown through * When Grassini came to this country, owing to the change from the air of Italy to that of England, her voice became one octave lower: after singing for two or three seasons, her natural voice returned, but it had lost its attractions with the low tones which bad obtained her the greatest applause.

Savart has however clearly mis- taken the circumstance wherein the essential principle of reeds consists, since those of the clarionet, bassoon, hautboy, &c. do not en- tirely close the apertures through which the breath passes ; and this is likewise the case with the natural reed formed by the lips of players on the flute and horn. There is in all probability a double action of the vocal cords in the production of sound ; the one being a vibratory motion throughout their length similar to that of a musical string, and the other an oscillation like that of a reed, forming a partial opening and closing of the glottis. The author is led to adopt this view of the functions of the vocal organs from considering that every circumstance which he has established in his previous investiga- tion of their action when treated as cords, is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis of their vibrating like the tongues of reeds ; for let us now suppose them to be simply mem- branous tongues. In this case the axis of motion is the edge of the ligament attached to the thyro-arytenoid muscle; the vibrations take place in a plane perpendicular to the axis of that muscle, and the length of the tongue is the breadth of the ligament. The author has observed in repeated experiments on the larynx after death, that the chink of the glottis was partially opened and closed in the production of sound, and Miiller found that by decreasing the breadth of the liga- ment he rendered the note more acute ; but as this breadth is so small, being in its ordi- nary state in an adult generally less than one- tenth of an inch, it is extremely difficult to measure the variations corresponding with different notes ; and the author cannot learn that any one has yet succeeded in determin- ing these varying lengths with sufficient ac- curacy to form data for the application of tiie mathematical formulae of elastic vibrating tongues.* We know that the number of vi- brations made by the same tongue in a given time varies inversely as the square of its length, If, therefore, a tongue whose length is only -1 inch give any note, the length ne- cessary to produce the octave will be '07 inch, that is, the variation will be only '03 inch ; we see then how minute must be the changes answering to the intermediate notes, and consequently how much more difficult it is to determine them in the vocal ligament when considered as a tongue than as a stretched membrane or cord. It is moreover observable that the extension and relaxation * The formula of Giordano Iticcati is N =,i2I) /2!?> L* V G where X is the number of vibrations, D the thickness, and L the length of the tongue or rod, R its rigidity, G its specific gravity, g the space through which a body falls by gravity in 1", and n a number 'constant for each mode of vibration, depending on the num- ber of nodes.VOICE. 1182 of the vocal cord, which, as we have seen, are analogous to those of a musical string, produce a corresponding shortening and elon- gation of its axis, regarded as a tongue ; and lastly, since one tone only is produced at a time, the vibrations resulting from the double action which appears to exist in the vocal apparatus must be synchronous. We have seen how nearly, when we take into account the delicacy and difficulty of the experiments, their results agree with the theory that the vocal cords are subject to the same laws as other stretched lamina?, and it would be highly interesting to compare these results with the simultaneous variations which they undergo transversely, and thus discover how far the laws of vibrating elastic tongues may be applied to them. It might possibly be objected to the idea of this twofold action, that the production of sound by the vocal cords is sufficiently accounted for by suppos- ing them to vibrate merely as elastic tongues; but then it is found by experiment, that by artificially dividing their length into two ven- tral segments, there results the octave of the fundamental note, which proves that at all events they vibrate as cords. In conclusion, we must ever bear in mind the vast difference between natural and artificial mechanism, and however complicated a problem it may be to determine that constitution of the vocal ap- paratus, by which the thyro-arytenoid liga- ments may simultaneously obey the laws of cords and tongues, yet to a physiologist who is accustomed to meet with the most admir- able contrivances and combinations in the animal frame, the difficulty of finding a strictly mathematical solution is, in such a case, no objection to its truth, when the facts, as fat- as they have been observed, are decidedly favourable to its reality. Were the move- ments of the glottis independent of any tube or column of air, the study of the functions of the vocal organs would be much more simple; but we find it situated nearly in the centre of the vocal tube of which the trachea and bronchi are the inferior, and the upper part of the larynx, pharynx, nose and mouth, the superior portion; we have therefore to consider the influence of this tube, and of its inclosed column of air in the production of voice. In order to investigate the mutual relations between a reed and a pipe, two methods may be adopted : one of these is to vary the pitch of the reed while the length of the pipe remains constant, and the other to vary the length of the pipe with a reed sounding one tone only when detached from the tube. In the construction of reeded pipes for musical purposes, it is incumbent on the mechanician to adjust the length of the tube to the pitch of the reed. When a free reed is used on the principle of Kratzenstein or Grenie, it is found that, if the pipe be not in perfect unison with the reed, the purity of the tone de- creases within certain limits, as the discord- ance between the reed and pipe increases. The researches of MM. Biot, YVeber, Willis and Miillcr have greatly enlarged our know- ledge on this subject. We learn from their ex- periments how great an influence is mutually exerted between a pipe and its reed, when the pitch of the one is made to vary while the other remains constant, and we may con- clude that analogous effects are produced between the vocal tube and the glottis. The slightest knowledge of acoustics is sufficient to inform us that the pitch of any pipe, such as the organ, the flute, the trumpet, in short of all musical tubes vibrating in a similar manner, depends on the velocity of an im- pulse propagated in the air within, and is determined by the length of the pipe. As long as the tubes of musical instruments re- main rigid, the nature of the materials which compose them does not affect the pitch of the sound, but merely influences the quality of the tone, and it is indifferent whether we employ metal, wood, or paper in their con- struction ; each of these substances will yield a tone of a particular timbre, or quality, de- pending on the nature of the motions pro- duced among its particles by the friction of the air on its surface; but the pitch will be the same in each, if the lengths of the pipes be equal, proving that the air itself is the source of sound. When, however, the sides of the tube are composed of flexible mem- branes, the inclosed air has a vibratory mo- tion, conjointly with, and subordinate to, that of the parietes of the tube, whereby the pitch of the sound is affected, as well as its quality. M. Savart* found that by taking tubes com- posed of layers of paper of constant length, but varying in thickness, graver sounds were produced as the parietes became thinner, and that the gravity of the sound was increased by moistening and relaxing the sides of the tubes. We shall presently see the application of these facts to the vocal apparatus. We find the flexibility of the Irachea and bronchi capable of being varied by the opera- tion of two forces, the one longitudinal or parallel to the axis of the tube, the other transverse. The first of these comprises the muscles which elevate and depress the larynx; the latter, the cartilaginous segments of rings perpendicular to the axis of tiie tube having muscular fibres attached to their posterior extremities, the contraction and elongation of which regulate the diameter of the trachea. The pharynx, mouth and nasal cavities, which form the superior extremity of the vocal tube, are also provided with muscles to modify the tension of that part of the tube so that it may vibrate synchronously with the rest. The necessity for this change in the dimen- sions of the tube, in order that it may vibrate in unison with the glottis, is in accordance, not only with the joint system of pipe and reed above described, but also with what actually takes place in the vocal organs of living animals. When the voice is raised in the scale from grave to acute, a corresponding elevation takes place in the larynx towards * Annales de Cheraie et de Physique, torn, xxxii.VOICE. 1483 the base of the cranium. By placing the finger on the pomum Adami this motion can be easily felt, and at the same time the thyroid cartilage is drawn up within the os-hyoides, and presses on the epiglottis; the small space between the thyroid and cricoid closes, the pharynx is contracted, the velum palati is tie- pressed and curved forward, and the tonsils approach each other : the reverse of these phenomena takes place during the descent of the voice. These are the principal pheno- mena common to most mammalia which can be recognised by external observation; the other changes being, on account of their situ- ation, invisible. The effects of these variations on the tone of the voice have been hitherto little under- stood. It has always appeared incomprehen- sible why the vocal tube should apparently increase in length in the production of the acute tones, and shorten in the grave ; a cir- cumstance which theoretically presents an acoustic paradox. Dodart and many others have conceived the elevation of the larynx to be merely for the purpose of shortening the vocal tube in the supra-laryngeal cavity, and have considered the trachea as producing no effect on the pitch of the tone. Majendie has also pointed out the shortening of this part of the tube. In order to ascertain the effect of these changes, the following experi- ments were made on the dead body. Having laid bare the vocal organs of an adult male, I raised the larynx to the position it would occupy by the elevation of the voice to an octave, being about half an inch, and at the same time minutely observed the position of the lowest ring of the trachea with reference to the sternum. By this operation 1 found the trachea was raised out of the chest, nearly to the same extent as the larynx had been elevated towards the base of the skull. The next step was to examine whether any change had taken place in the diameter of the tube. For this purpose, having measured the diame- ter of the trachea in its natural position, the larynx was again elevated to the same extent as before, when the diameter was found diminished one-third. These experiments prove that, contrary to the general precon- ception, the elevation of the larynx shortens the tube independently of the contraction between the thyroid cartilage and os-hyoides, and at the same time lessens its diameter. The same effects may easily be detected dur- ing life by placing the finger on the trachea immediately above the sternum during the elevation of the larynx, when the trachea is found to ascend out of the chest, and after- wards to return to its former position ; a movement in which the lungs and bronchi participate. The alteration of the tube in diameter may also be perceived by grasping the trachea with the finger and thumb during the elevation and depression of the larynx.* These movements are so striking as to lead * Essays by the author, in the London and Edin- burgh Philosophical Magazine, for September, Oc- tober, and November, 1836. irresistibly to the conclusion, that there exists a constant adaptation between the tension and the vibrating length of the thyro-arytenoid ligaments and the walls of the vocal tube, in the production of tones of the ordinary re- gister; for we have seen that the variations of the vocal cords, at least as far as relates to the modulation of sound, are perfectly in- dependent of the length of the vocal tube, and consequently the changes in its length which we have just described are not at all necessary for that purpose. Again, the vocal tube is so short, that, as has been ascertained by Weber and others, it could not, were it rigid, affect the pitch of the note produced by the glottis. As however this tube is com- posed of flexible materials, its effects are similar to those observed in M. Savart's ex- periments ; that is, the relaxed state of the parietes compensates for its want of length, and enables it to \ibrate synchronously, and therefore to give forth sounds equally grave with those of the glottis, thereby reinforcing the tone which would indeed be produced, though with much less intensity, without this aid. The Falsetto, or voce ill testa, has always been considered a most embarrassing subject of re- search, anil its peculiar quality has excited the attention both of the physiologist and of the musician. Its most remarkable characteristic consists in its being less reedy in tone, and partaking nearly of the quality of the har- monic sounds of stringed and wind instru- ments. The change produced in the voice when passing from the falsetto into the com- mon tone, or the reverse, is in some persons very sensible to the ear, whilst in others it is almost imperceptible. Some individuals,more- over, have the faculty of producing in the same pitch as many as eight or ten tones, possessing either the falsetto or the common character. The falsetto has been generally ascribed to some particular adaptation of the upper liga- ments of the larynx. Dodart* has attempted to prove that it is a supra-laryngeal function, and that the nose becomes the principal tube of sound instead of the cavity of the mouth. Bennati f also considered these tones as being modulated by the supra-laryngeal cavity alone. This hypothesis, however, is untenable, since it supposes the column of air not to be in- fluenced by the trachea, which is contrary to experience. In order to detect some of the movements of the larynx while the voice is passing from the first to the second, or falsetto register, it is only necessary to place the point of the finger in the crico-thyroid chink, w hen it is found that at the moment the transition from the primary to the secondary register takes place, this chink, which was closed dur- ing the production of the highest note of the ordinary register, suddenly opens on the pro- duction of the first note of the falsetto register, and consequently the thyro-arytenoid liga- ments are relaxed at the same moment the * Mem. de PAcad. 1707. t Rechcrches sur le Me'chanisme de la Yoix humaine.1484 VOICE. larynx falls, and the vocal tube is lengthened, although during these changes the tones become more acute. As soon as this has taken place, the larynx again rises as the voice becomes more acute. In a mezzo-soprano voice en- dowed with a double falsetto, or third register consisting of several tones of each register, with the power of producing tones of the same pitch either of the ordinary or the fal- setto quality, we observed that the larynx fell at the commencement of each register, and that the thyro-arytenoid ligaments were twice relaxed, but in a much smaller degree. These observations have since been verified by many musical persons. In order to explain the phenomena as con- nected with the production of falsetto tones, we must remember that at the highest note of the primary register the crico-tby roid mus- cles are contracted as much as possible in closing the crico-thyroid chink, and therefore that no further tension of the vocal cords can take place. In this state of things, the thyro- arytenoid muscles are at their maximum of elongation, and their transverse section is a minimum; consequently neither can a higher note be produced by an extension of the liga- ments, nor are these muscles in a condition to affect the dimensions of the glottis; hence the necessity of some alteration in the state of the larynx in order to effect the scale of the fal- setto, which is an octave above the ordinary register, and to prevent the mere repetition of the same series of sounds. This alteration might be produced in two ways ; one of these is a partial closing of the aperture of the glottis caused by the action of the thyro-arvtenoid muscles when they have returned to their ordinary condition, and are in a favourable state to produce that effect under the influence of the laryngeal nerves. For, let us suppose the larynx to be in the same state as at the commencement of the primary register, except that the chink of the glottis is half closed ; the consequence will be that as only half the length of the ligaments can be made to vibrate, the octave of the lowest note in that register will result from the same tension which pro- duced that note, and this will manifestly be repeated in consecutive notes of the range of the falsetto. This range is limited in general to a few notes, owing probably to the chink being soon completely closed by the stretching of the vocal cords. It is also owing to this partial closing of the glottis that a much less quantity of air is required for the falsetto than for the ordinary scale, which is proved by our being able to sustain a given note in the fal- setto to a much longer time than we can sus- tain the corresponding note in the primary register. The partial closing of the glottis was observed by Majendie in his experiments on the dog, and by Mayo in the human subject. Another explanation was suggested by Gott- fried Weber, namely, that the falsetto range is caused by a nodal division of the vocal cords producing harmonics of the fundamental notes, by which means the glottis acquires the same pitch as if it were half closed. If wc consider the glottis as a reed, it is evident that since the number of vibrations must in this case be the same for the same note as when we sup- pose the ligaments to obey the laws of cords, the axis of vibration or the breadth of the liga- ment must be duly diminished, which may be brought about by the rotation of the thyro- arytenoid muscle on its axis. Having thus considered how the glottis may act in the falsetto range, let us now examine in what way the vocal tube contributes to its formation. We have seen that this tube gra- dually shortens during the ascent of the pri- mary register, suddenly falls to its original length when the falsetto commences, and again diminishes during the secondary register. Now it appears from Savart's experiments that, notwithstanding the shortness of this tube, the wave length of a column of air vibrating within it is the same as that of a rigid pipe of much greater length, and we have therefore strong grounds for believing that the notes of the primary register are reinforced in con- sequence of the vibrations of the glottis being always in unison with the fundamental pitch of the walls of the tube ; hence in the falsetto, when the vocal apparatus has resumed its original condition, there will be less reinforce" ment of the sound, since the parietes of the vocal pipe are no longer in unison with the glottis, but give its grave octaves. We have found, by numerous experiments, that a flex- ible disc will vibrate to almost any pitch, but will reinforce the sound in a trifling degree only, unless the pitch be in unison with its fundamental note ; and on the same principle we may suppose the intensity of the notes in the second register to be diminished, and their quality to be modified by the forced vibration of the walls of the tube, while in the primary all things concur in augmenting the effects produced by the glottis. Miiller agrees with Lehfeldt in opinion, that the falsetto notes are produced by the vibrations of the inner por- tion of the borders of the vocal ligaments, and the variation of the pitch by their tension ; and, although he does not mention by what mechanism this is effected, he seems to attri- bute it chiefly to the agency of the thyro- arytenoid muscles. The author's explanation is in many points coincident with that of Miiller, but he has taken into account one or two circumstances which appear to have escaped Midler's attention. The natural key or pitch of the vocal organs may be found by sounding the voice, without either elevating or depressing the larynx. The grave octave of that note will be the fundamental sound of the vocal ligaments vibrating in their most relaxed state, with the glottis entirely open. Any tones of a graver pitch, produced by an unusually relaxed state of the vocal cords, lose both their quality and intensity, and cannot be included in the compass natural to the voice. According to the preceding principles, the pitch of the voice being usually an octave, or a fifth graver than the length of a column of air within the vocal pipe, we see the cause why a falsetto quality of sound cannot be1485 VOICE. obtained except during the production of acute tones. In many persons the speaking pitch is an entire octave graver than corresponds to the length of a tube, which would enable a column of air to produce the same sound ; and in such persons the falsetto can seldom be effected. In consequence of the pitch of the vocal organs thus occupying a middle or central position between the acute and grave notes, a great facility is afforded to their action in modulating the voice. The vocal tube, like any other tube open at both ends, is said to be capable of producing the harmonics of its fundamental tone in the ratio of the series of natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4. These harmonic sounds have been described by Knecht of Leipsic, and by Dr. Young. I have occasion- ally thought that I have heard them during the forcible expiration which attends the bois- terous laughter of children. The density of the air inspired is said to affect the pitch of the voice as in rigid tubes. The influence of the epiglottis on the voice has been the subject of divers hypotheses. MM. Biot, Majendie, and Mayo have inferred, from the experiments of Grenie, that the epi- glottis prevents the tones from becoming more acute when they increase in intensity. Lis- covius, on the other hand, states that neither its depression, elevation, nor even its entire removal has any effect on the voice.* Haller appears to have deduced the same opinion from the circumstance of birds being destitute of this organ. "Epiglottis equidem nihil facit ad vocem, cum ea (vox) nata sit et perfecta quamprimum aer ex glottidis rima prodit, et absque epiglottide aves suavissime canant."-)- According to Miiller, the influence of this organ on the pitch of the voice is exercised during its depression only, rendering the tones graver, and at the same time duller. He thinks we evidently employ it in this way during the production of very deep tones ; and observes that, by introducing the finger at the side of the mouth, the epiglottis will be found to maintain the same position during the utter- ance of musical notes, whether they be of the falsetto character, or of the ordinary scale. I am disposeil to ascribe to the functions of the epiglottis much the same value as Miiller ; since it is clear that its presence is not essen- tial to the mere formation of voice, for it may be removed, together with the superior ligaments of the glottis, the ventricles of the larynx, and the capitula laryngis of Santorini, without im- pelling the vibratory movements of the glottis. The art of singing consists in the applica- tion of the vocal organs to produce a certain succession of tones in some determinate order, which constitutes melody. This can be ac- complished with precision by those only who can accurately discern with the ear, and imi- tate with the voice, the variations of the pitch of a musical instrument, or other sounding body. In many persons the perception of sound is defective; so that, whatever may be the purity and intensity of their notes as single uncon- nected musical sounds, they can never be used for musical purposes, that is, for sounds succeeding each other at regular intervals, governed by fixed rules. Many persons can imitate the voices of birds and beasts, and diversify the character of their tones to an in- definite extent. These performances illustrate the perfection of the human voice, but the artifices by which they are effected have no reference to the subject under investigation. The musical varieties of the human voice are classed according to their pitch, or the middle note of their primary register, which depends on the dimensions ami physical constitution of the vocal ligaments. These varieties are, the Bass, the Tenor, the Contralto, and the Soprano*; the usual compass of each kind in the adult is represented in the annexed table. | Contralto. "| Soprano. | C D E F G A B C D1 E> F> G' A' B' C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 A2 B2 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 A3 B3 C3 I Tenor. I Bass. In addition to these characteristic and prin- cipal divisions of the voice, there are certain others, called the Baritone, the Mezzo-soprano, and the Soprano-sfogato, which are subdivisions of the foregoing, and the place of either of which in the scale is indicated by its name. We see by this table what an extensive variety of harmonious sounds may be produced by the combinations of the different kinds of voice. In ordinary singers the range seldom exceeds two octaves, except in those endowed with a falsetto. There have been some celebrated singers, such as Catalani, Malibran, and others, whose compass has even exceeded three octaves, but such instances are rare. The * Theorie der Stimme. Leips. 181-1. f Physiology, lib. ix. p. 372. voices in both male and female are nearly of the same pitch until the age of puberty, at which period the voice of males sinks an octave. This change of pitch is owing to a sudden enlargement of the larynx, the antero- posterior diameter of which is augmented by from one-fourth to one-third, with a simul- taneous lengthening of the vocal ligaments. During this process the voice is hoarse, and there is a temporary inability to regulate it. Eunuchs do not undergo this change. Ben- nati is of opinion that the voice should not be * The first two of these belong to the male sex, and the last two to the female.

There are, however, many examples of per- sons possessing fine voices, who never paid the least attention to this rule. The oral, nasal, and pharyngeal cavities exercise an important influence on the quality of sounds after their production by the larynx. Further effects are ascribed by Bennati to the arches of the palate, the uvula, and velum, all of which appear to contract with the acute, and relax with the grave tones, and are in constant motion during the modulation of the voice. The contraction of these parts during the production of acute sounds has also been observed by Fabricius ab Aquapendente, Meyer, Gerdy, and Dzondi. Bennati con- ceived, as has been already mentioned, that the falsetto notes, which he calls notes " sur- laryngiennes," are produced exclusively in the superior part of the vocal tube; but it has been shown that this hypothesis is contrary to acoustic principles, and that the same motions of the palate are also equally observable during the production of acute tones of the ordinary register. MLiller also states that the arches of the palate may be touched by the finger with- out altering the pitch, which could not be the case on the hypothesis of Bennati. It is to be remarked that neither Muller nor Bennati mentions the opening of the crico-thyroid chink on sounding the first note in the falsetto re- gister ; neither do they mention the simul- taneous falling of the larynx, and they deny the existence of a third register. According to the hypothesis of Lehfeldt and Muller, any increased intensity of vocal sound ought to raise the pitch of the voice ; but if this were the case, the performance of prolonged vocal sounds on the same note, but of variable in- tensity, would be rendered impossible without a simultaneous adjustment between the tension of the vocal ligaments and the current of air ; whereas, by examining the state of the crico- thyroid chink during the utterance of these sounds, it is found that no such adjustment takes place. The exquisite quality of the sounds of the larynx, when modified by the oral and nasal cavities, renders the human voice far superior to any artificial musical in- strument ; since its tones glide through all the en-harmonic intervals between successive notes, an effect which no such instrument can perfectly imitate. Dodart estimates the num- ber of tones which can be produced by the voice and appreciated by the ear in the com- pass of an octave, at three hundred : a striking proof of the complete control exercised by the laryngeal nerves over the vocal apparatus. The action of the vocal organs in producing speech is a distinct branch of the physiology of voice, which the author has elsewhere in- vestisrated.* It is well known that the vowel sounds have been imitated by Kratzenstein, * Vide " On Articulate Sounds, and on the Causes and Cure of Impediments of Speech. London. 1851." De Kcmpelen, and Willis, by means of me- chanism, and that the principles on which they depend have been successfully analysed by the latter : but this is a subject which would require a very lengthened examination to render it the justice which its importance demands. Having now completed the investigation of the physiological character of the human organs of voice, and having for the sake of simplicity considered them in three distinct lights, namely, as membranous ligaments obey- ing the laws of musical strings, as a reeded instrument, and as a membranous pipe with a column of air vibrating within it, tiie results of the various experiments which have been noticed would certainly seem to warrant the conclusion that each of these views is cor- rect ; for it cannot be denied that these ex- periments clearly show the vocal apparatus to be influenced by the air expelled from the chest in precisely the same way as if it were a stretched cord, a reed, or a vibrating tube. Why then should we hesitate to adopt the obvious conclusion that the vocal organs do hi fact combine the properties of these various instruments, and are themselves the perfect types of which these instruments are only im- perfect imitations ? The error of those who have preceded the author in this inquiry seems to consist in viewing the organs of voice, not as a complex, but as a simple ap- paratus; with some the favourite hypothesis has accordingly been that of musical strings, with others that of a reed, while experiments are equally in favour of both. It cannot be expected that in this brief treatise, a subject, wherein, notwithstanding the attention hitherto bestowed on it for many years by men of the highest philosophical talent, so little comparatively has been effected, should be at once exhausted, and all its diffi- culties removed ; but the inductive method, the only satisfactory mode of reasoning on such subjects, has been most scrupulously pursued; and whatever explanations have been offered of the phenomena of the voice are at least founded on facts which are incontro- vertibly established. Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Organs of Voice. — Having given an outline of the structure and functions of the vocal organs in man, and stated our views of the principles on which the produc- tion of voice depends, we shall now proceed to the investigation of the physiology of voice in the lower animals. Mammalia. — In the various orders of mam- malia the organs of voice present different grades of development and complexity of structure, producing in each case some pecu- liarity of timbre, or quality of tone, by which we are enabled to distinguish them from one another. Some species are mute, such as tiie giraffe, armadillo, and others, whilst some possess voices of greater or less intensity. The organs of voice in the lower mammalia, as well as in man, are composed of lungs, which, considered in an acoustic point of view, actVOICE. 1487 merely as bellows, the trachea or pipe, and the larynx* or reed. The nervous and mus- cular systems are similar to those of man, and do not require to be treated in detail. The acoustic principles of the first section will generally be applicable to the lower orders of Mammalia, so that when the structure is given the functions will be understood. In the account of the anatomy of the vocal organs given by Cuvier, Vicq d'Azyr, Brandt, Wolff', Henle, and others, no estimate is made of the relative dimensions of the larynx in the various classes of animals ; therefore, in order that the reader may form an idea of their magnitude in Mammalia, compared with that of man,")" it will only be necessary, in those which have a similarity of figure, to give the linear value of one of their dimensions, namely, that of the mean height of the superior margin of the thyroid, above the plane of the base of the cricoid, since their respective magnitudes will be as the cubes of those heights.^ Also the lengths of the inferior thyro-arytenoid liga- ments, when devoid of tension, are given. The letters H and L will be used to represent the heights and lengths respectively. Quadrumana.—The vocal organs of the Quadrumana have already engaged the atten- tion of several distinguished anatomists, such as Vicq d'Azyr, Camper, Hunter, Cuvier, Brandt, and others ; and a condensed view of this part of the subject will be now given.

J In most Mammalia the figures of the larynges are similar; but in some orders they are dissimilar. For instance, in the Cervus, amongst the Ruminantia, the thyroid bulges out considerably in front, and in the Sus scrofa, amongst the Pachydermata, it is ex- tremely narrow. In the Cetacea the whole larynx differs from those of all the other orders. § These measures relate to an animal not quite full grown, and are rather too small for an adult chimpanzee.

Birds.— The vocal organs of birds differ from every other class of animals by the con- stitution of the superior, and by the addition of an inferior larynx. The same acoustics apply, with few exceptions, to all Mammalia, but in birds is required an additional investi- gation. The superior larynx of birds is situated immediately below the os-hyoides, to which it is connected by the thyroid membrane, and hyo-aryngcal muscles. Its figure and struc- ture are more uniform than those of the inferior larynx. It is partly cartilaginous, and partly osseous. The thyroid cartilage forms the anterior, and part of the lateral boundary of the larynx, and rests upon the first ring of the trachea. Wings, superior margin ascending forwards and upwards, meet each other in the mesial line, where the cartilage terminates in either a pointed, rounded, or flattened projection; in- ferior margin usually horizontal, corresponding to the first ring of the trachea, as in Palmi- pedes, but are excavated in Scansores. The posterior margins terminate in two quad- rangular bones, with which the thyroid carti- lage is frequently ossified (and these then become portions of the wings of the thyroid ; the quadrilateral bones, being also oblique angled, are shaped to form a union with the posterior margin of the thyroid, and present horizontal edges above and below, leaving a small triangular space for the cricoid cartilage posteriorly. The cricoid is a small triangular bone, lying on the inside of the posterior edges of the two quadrangular bones ; it supports the two arytenoid cartilages, as in Mammalia; and although it forms a very small portion of a ring, it is yet necessary for the completion of it. These four bony or cartilaginous pieces are most distinct in young birds, and amongst old ones are quite distinct in the Anas c/o- mesticus and Anas mollissimus, but are con- solidated into one in the Scansores, ostrich, and many others. The arytenoid cartilages are long and tapering upwards and forwards, and form by their inner margins laterally the rima glottidis: they are generally ossified. Their external margins are bounded by the thyroid cartilage, and their inner margins form the rima glottidis. Epiglottis. — In most birds the epiglottis is situated on the internal surface of the thyroid ; it is rudimentary, and is termed the processus epiglottitis : it is generally osseous, but ac- cording to Henle it is leaf-like in the stork and heron ; and in some of the Gallinaceas, as in Sterna,Rallies, and Larus, it is thin, flat, and flexible, as in Mammalia.

The glottis is opened by the thyro-arytenoideus posticus, and closed by the thyro-arytenoideus lateralis, as in the higher order of reptiles. The superior larynx is supplied by the superior laryngeal nerve alone, the inferior laryngeal terminating in the inferior larynx and trachea. The inferior larynx. — This organ is pecu- liar to birds. It is exceedingly diversified in form and structure. It is always found except in the condor, and other vultures. If we make a section of the lower larynx of birds in the mesial plane, its lateral segments, if viewed separately, present a double organ of sound ; the exceptions to this rule are, the parrot, perroquet, and cockatoo. The inferior larynx of birds is often a very complex structure, and may be considered a double reed furnished with a pipe. It is symmetrical in most orders of birds except the Palmipedes, and is situated between the last ring of the trachea and first of the bronchi; it lies upon the oesophagus pos- teriorly, where there is generally a triangular space for the passage of that tube. The frame-work of the inferior larynx is formed by the developement of several lower rings of the trachea, which take diversified forms in different orders of birds, and some- times in the sub-genera of the same order, as in Mergus and Anas among the Palmipedes. In those birds which have a pure quality of voice, and whose instinct excites them to pro- duce a continuous succession of tones, con- stituting some defined melody, we find the * Although anatomists are generally agreed respect- ing t he position and figure of the several pieces which enter into the formation of the superior larynx of birds, they differ widely in reference to the parts which they represent when compared with man. Cuvier conceives that the posterior cartilage, which Humboldt1 calls sockel, represents the cricoid of Mammalia, and that birds are destitute of epiglottis, thyroid, and arytenoid cartilages. Fabricius2 con- siders it best to divide the pieces into three parts, viz. two arytenoids and an os-innominatum. Tiede- 111,111113 thinks the anterior piece represents the thyroid, the quadrangular pieces the cricoid, and the triangular the arytenoid cartilages of Mamma- lia. Meckel4, on the contrary, considers the trian- gular pieces to be the cricoid divided. Carus5 supposes the quadrangular pieces to be arytenoids, and the triangular the cartilages of Santorini. Wagner6 unites the single with the quadrilateral pieces for a cricoid, and the triangular for the arytenoids. 1 Observations de Zoologie. 2 De Larynge. P. i. cap. vii. In op. omnia.

Among the Insessores, the Corvidae and Sylviadae have the external walls of the infe- rior larynx composed on each side of three semilunar bones which are developed from the inferior portion ot the trachea. The larynx is bounded internally by a bone, which tra- verses the lower end of the trachea, the verti- cal longitudinal section of which coincides with the plane of the mesial section i {fig. 912): this os transversale, after stretching across the tube, divides at each end into two laminae, which diverge laterally from the axis of the bone to meet the two first external bones of the larynx, thus strengthening and complet- ing its solid framework. The superior part of the os transversale is concave, and fur- nished with a very thin delicate membrane, rising vertically from the bone h (fig. 912): this is called by Savart the membrana semi- lunaris. Fig. 912. Section of the lower Larynx. h, membrana semilunaris; i, os transversale; g, membrana tympaniformis. This membrane is most developed in sing- ing birds, and is considered by Savart to be one of the most essential organs of voice in the inferior larynges of the nightingales, thrushes, linnets, finches, and other singing birds, as well as in speaking birds, such as the pies, jays, &c. The inferior edge of the os trans- versale gives attachment to the membrana tym- paniformis. Bones of the inferior larynx. — The first bone a (fig. 913_) is flattened and curved, being convex externally, and concave inter- nally: it forms the boundary of the internal lateral face of the larynx. The second bone b (fig. 913) presents nearly the same form as the first, but it possesses greater mobility, the muscles which are in- serted into it drawing it upwards and out-VOICE. 1497 wards perpendicularly to the axis of the bonchus of the same side, by which means the area of the latter is varied. The third bone is but very slightly curved (c). It is separated from the second bone by a triangular membrane; having its extremities articulated to the second bone by ligaments which permit of an extensive freedom of mo- tion, particularly of a rotatory movement on its axis, and it is an important agent, accord- ing to Savart, in modulating the voice. The internal surface of this bone is lined with a fibrous cord which forms the external lip of the glottis. The posterior extremities of these three bones are not united, but have a triangular space between them for the passage of the oesophagus. Fig. 913.

The Mcmbrana tympaniformis.— This is a thin transparent membrane, extending from the os transversale to the extremities of the bronchial half-rings g (Jigs. 912 and 914) : it forms the internal surface of the larynx and bronchi, and is a continuation of the semilunar membrane; so that the tympaniform and semilunar membranes are stretched simul- taneously, and the latter is acted upon through the instrumentality of the former. The Arytenoid Cartilage. — This is a small body situated at the head of the second bone : it is described by Savart as being of a lozenge shape in the starling, but very short in the nightingale. This form of larynx in the Cor- vidae and Sylviadae is provided with six pairs of muscles.* (See Jig. 914.)

Anterior view of the same, Shewing the mcmbrana tympaniformis, g. transversale, of which the left is always the largest. The figure of the os transversale is very similar to that of the arytenoid cartilage in the human larynx, consisting of prominences, ridges, and base : the superior prominence of this bone projects high into the tube of the trachea, and completely divides the larynx at its base. The ridge on its left side is fur- nished with a salient lamina, corresponding to a thin transparent semilunar lamina, situated opposite to it: the latter is placed at the en- trance of a small osseous cavity at the infe- rior boundary of the left larynx; a still larger osseous cavity lies obliquely above the semi- lunar membrane. The air sets this membrane in motion as it circulates in the left chambers of the larynx, and contributes to the produc- tion of the well-known peculiar character of voice in this bird. On the right side the cavity of the larynx is of smaller dimensions, of less irregular form, and destitute of those prominent ridges and salient lamina? within. There appears to be a small tympanic mem- brane attached to the first few rings of the bronchus on the right side. In the Mergus serrator the inferior larynx is partly osseous, and partly membranous : it consists of two irregular cavities. The os transversale, i(fg. 915), which has an exten- sive union along its posterior edge and base with the bony boundaries of the larynx, divides this tube into two parts, except at its superior prominence, where it leaves a channel b for the air from the right bronchus f, to pe- netrate the trachea. On the right lateral surface of the larynx, a large oval membrane1498 VOICE. forms the boundary : the rest of this cavity is composed of bone. On the left side the larynx is furnished with four membranes, of unequal dimensions, which are inclined to each other at different angles ; of these membranes three are lateral, and the fourth forms the base. The internal lateral membrane b lies almost parallel to the superior promontory of the os transversale i, from which it is separated by a channel, leading from the left to the right larynx.* Through this channel the air from the left bronchus must pass to reach the trachea. The internal lateral membrane has a free salient edge inferiorly, over which the air brushes in its passage from the lungs to the trachea.f The posterior, anterior, and lateral mem- Fie. branes are supported by bony rings, of which the anterior is the largest. The membrane forming the base is penetrated by the left bronchial tube, and is connected with several of the bronchial rings through the medium of the membrana tympaniformis. Thus the air from the lungs throws into vibration one large membrane in the right, and four in the left larynx, all of unequal dimensions, and con- stituting a very complex piece of mechanism. In the M. Merganser or Goosander the inferior larynx is most developed on the left side h (fig. 916), which is chiefly mem- branous, while the other side d is composed principally of bone. On the left side there are four irregular membranes, a, b, c,supported 915. Two views of the Inferior Larynx of the dlergus Serrator. by bones, and that on the external ring h. The os transversale is very small and does not reach the free edge of the internal mem- brane b, which is similar to that of the Mcrgus serrator, thus leaving a communi- cation open between the right and left side of the cavity of the larynx, through which the air from the left lung must pass to reach the tube of the trachea, which terminates on the superior part of the right side of the larynx. The right side is chiefly surrounded by bone externally, having a very small oval membrane anteriorly, and is furnished with a small tympanic membrane at its junction with the bronchus. The salient portions of these membranes, and the small membrana tym- paniformis are best adapted for putting the air into a state of vibration, reinforced by * The area of this channel is increased by an osseous cavity which is formed by the posterior con- cave surface of the ridge g, lying externally in front of the larynx. t Beneath the inferior point of attachment of the internal lateral membrane, the above-mentioned conical osseous cavity passes vertically downwards c terminating between the bronchi in a kind of cul de sae. the chambers of which the larynx is com- posed. Fig. 916 Inferior Larynx of the 31. Merganser.VOICE 1-199 In the female the larynx is of a much simpler structure, the external wall is com- posed of several consolidated rings, those situ- ated below the os transversale terminating in the membrana tympaniformis between the last bone of the larynx and first of the bronchus. In the Anas clangula we find another variety in the structure of the vocal organs. The inferior larynx is nearly of a semilunar form, with its convex surface directed exteriorly ; it is situated obliquely to the axis of the trachea. It is partly bony, and partly mem- branous, and divided into several cavities. A large semilunar bone forms the principal framework of the whole larynx. On the left side there are two cavities, one of which is situated above the other. The superior cavity is formed by a groove in the semilunar bone by which it is bounded both externally and in- ternally, but is furnished with a membrane above. At the posterior extremity of the bone forming the floor of this cavity, there is a perforation by which the air in the inferior cavity from the left bronchus is admitted. The inferior cavity lies at the base of the larynx, and is connected with both bronchial and tracheal apertures; it is bounded an- teriorly by the semilunar bone, and inferiorly by the basilar membrane. On the right side the semilunar bone forms externally a protuberance, which is concave within, forming the anterior and lateral bound- ary of a large cavity which lies between the bronchial and tracheal apertures. This cavity is subdivided by bone and membranes into two irregularly formed cul de sacs, which are nearly parallel to the axis of the trachea. The os transversale is a very irregularly formed bone, as in the Mergansers, dividing the larynx into two unequal and unsymmetrical parts; its superior prominence, which is conical, penetrates the trachea nearly one- eighth of the entire length of that tube. The rings of the trachea here are no longer entire but divided anteriorly and posteriorly by a dense membrane, and in some places by os- seous interposed substances, the whole being supported within by the os transversale. A basilar membrane supported by the semilunar bone, forms the floor of the larynx. This membrane is perforated by the bronchial tubes, and is connected with the bronchi by means of the membrana tympani. In the female, the left side of the larynx lies above the right, as does that of the male, and the base is like- wise oblique to the axis of the trachea. The trachea of the male has an enlargement occu- pying about one-fourth of its length, its size being regulated by an additional pair of mus- cles, which draws the rings of that part either into an oblique, or into a nearly horizontal position. The whole of this complicated mechanism is concerned in producing the tones peculiar to the A. clangula. The A. rufina, or red-breasted whistling duck, presents another instance of laryngeal struc- ture peculiar to itself; but our limits will not admit our giving its enatomv in detail : let it suffice therefore to mention, that its left cavity, which is largest, is chiefly membranous, whilst the right is almost entirely osseous, and some- what resembles in external form the larynx of Mergas Merganser. A. muscatus, A. Penelope, or widgeon, and A. JEgyptlaca, have also bony enlargements of the inferior larynx ; but the Anser domesticus, and the Lams, and Ardca, with some others amongst the Grallatores, are destitute of these enlarged cavities common in the order Anas. The organs of voice in the Palmipedes are, with a few exceptions, only provided with one pair of muscles.* In the Gallinaceae the structure of the in- ferior larynx is more uniform, simple, and symmetrical than in the Palmipedes. In the male Phasianus gal/us, the common cock, this larynx is composed externally of two or three of the lower half rings of the trachea, con- nected in the inside with the os transversale both anteriorly and posteriorly, through the interposition of two triangular laminas given off by it, which are also connected with the bronchi. Between the rings of the larynx there is interposed a membrane which forms the side of the glottis externally. The inferior portion of the trachea is much com- pressed laterally. The inferior larynx of the pheasant does not differ materially in structure from that of the cock. In the partridge the os transversale is attached immediately to the last half ring of the larynx. In the Gallinaceas, owing to the os transversale lying below the last semilunar rings of the larynx, the membranes on each side are immediately opposite to each other, so as to form the two sides of the glottis, and the larynx is not en- tirely a double reed as in the Sylviada?, in which the membrana semilunaris forms with the membrana tympani the interior lips of the glottis, and divides the larynx into a double organ of voice. In this respect the structure of the larynx in the Gallinacese is intermediate between the parrots and the singing birds. The trachea being compressed laterally, and the glottis very straight, these, according to Cuvier, may be considered the causes of the acute sounds which these birds produce. They are provided with one pair of muscles. In the Indian pigeon, however, the sterno- tracheal muscles divide, and send a few fibres to the inferior larynx. In the Falcons, the larynx being provided with but one pair of muscles, viz. the sterno- tracheal, its structure is much more simple than in the singing birds. The membrana tympani is however large, but does not appear to give off any semilunar membrane. The bronchial rings are distant from each other, and bound together by thin membranes ; the rings of the larynx are almost in juxtaposition, leaving no vibratile membranous space be- tween them ; consequently the membrana tympani is the chief vibrating tissue. The order also has one pair of vocal muscles. Scansores. — In the parrots the inferior * The exceptions in this order are the Velvet duel; the Golden Eye, the Red Breasted Merganser, and Ganet, in which there are two pairs.1500 VOICE. larynx differs in structure from that of any other order of birds. They have no os transversale dividing the vocal organs, which is conse- quently a single larynx. The segments of the rings in which the lower end of the trachea terminates are consolidated together on each side. The last two of these segments are of a crescent-like or semilunar form, with its axis nearly perpendicular to the axes of the ring of the trachea; they are concave to each other, and their extremities articulated together, forming an elliptical space which is furnished with a thin vibratile membrane, as seen in fig. 917. At their junction is the joint or axis on which they revolve upon each other, and by which the tension of the mem- brane of the glottis is capable of being varied. Fig. 917. Inferior Larynx of the Parrot, a, b, tensors of the glottis; c, laxator of glottis. The glottis is formed on each side by the elastic membranes that fill the space between the semilunar bones); these membranes leave a narrow chink between them through which the air from the lungs passes, and puts them in a state of vibration whenever the bird draws them sufficiently tense ; for this pur- pose they are provided with three pairs of muscles, of which two a, b, are tensors, and one c laxator of the glottis. The trachea of birds comprehends that portion of the vocal tube which lies between the superior and inferior larynx ; its diameter and length generally depend on the length of the neck of the bird. In the common crane, the trachea after making its exit from the thorax, penetrates the sterno-tracheal space, and then making four turns upon itself in the same plane, it leaves the breast bone to follow its course into the neck : by this ar- rangement the vocal tube is greatly lengthened for the purposes of voice, and the surface of the sternum increased for the attachment of the great pectoral muscles without adding materially to the weight of the bird. The voice of the crane is very sonorous, and may be heard at a great distance. In Bewick's swan (fig. 918), the manner in which a considerable additional length is given to the trachea by its convolutions, will be evident upon an inspection of the figure. The spoonbill presents another remark- able instance of convoluted trachea, doubling twice upon itself. Other examples of con- voluted trachea are found in the Gal- linaceae ; as in the Rhynchcsa Australia, and Phasianus Purraqua. In the singing birds the trachea is a cylindrical tube; the rings which are at first cartilaginous become ossi- fied with age. The tracheal rings, which are entire in the adult state, being connected by elastic membranes, are at a sufficient distance from each other to allow of all the movements of the neck. Fig. 918. Inferior larynx and convoluted Trachea in Bewick's Swan, from Yarrell. The diameter of the trachea in singing birds is nearly uniform and proportional to its length ; but among the Palmipedes, the Mergansers, and some species of Anas, as the A. fnsca and A. rnfina, there are tracheal en- largements with additional muscles, to control their dimensions. The number of rings in the trachea of some birds is very great, sur- passing that of any other class of animals. In the Pkcenicopterus, according to Dr. Grant, there are at least 350 rings. Physiology of the Voice of Birds.— The vocal apparatus of birds consists of the lungs, larynx, and trachea, representing a wind chest, reed, and pipe. The inferior larynx has been proved by Cuvier to be the organ in whic h the sounds are generated. To ascertain this fact, he divided the trachea of a black- bird about the middle ot its length, thus pre- venting the passage of the air through the superior orifice; the bird notwithstanding con- tinued to sing, though the tones were more feeble than before. In a second experiment on the pie, performed in the same manner, the bird cried with as great intensity of tone, and with the same acuteness as before the opera- tion, for the space of about ten minutes when the blood from the wound being drawn into the larynx suffocated the animal. These experiments, however, were sufficient to prove that the sound did not arise from the superior larynx ; and when we view the structure of that organ, and, find it destitute of vocal ligaments, or any salient membranous lamina?, and bounded by cartilaginous or osseous matter, and compare it with the complex organization of the inferior larynx, we might1501 VOICE. without experiments conclude the latter to be the organ of sound. The superior larynx nevertheless performs an important office, both preventing the passage of the food into the wind-pipe, and modifying the sound of the voice. It can be opened and closed with rapidity, in singing birds ; and is actively employed in the production of melody : we can easily witness its simultaneous movements with the mouth, in the song of the canary, linnets, and others. Its influence on the pitch is according to Savart, but little, not amounting to more than a semitone. The inferior larynx may be considered a reed prefixed to a tube. The salient laminae of the membrana tympaniformis, and the mem- brana semilunaris are especially adapted to produce a series of vibrations, when a current of air is forced into the bronchi. It is indeed only necessary to dissect out the vocal tube of a bird, (such as that of the goose for example), and blow into it by the mouth, to elicit sounds. In the singing birds, which have the lower larynx furnished with the most elaborate muscular apparatus, the tension of the vibra- tile membrane of the glottis can be regulated with precision, so as to enable them to effect the varied melodies which nature or art dictates. In order to prove the duplex structure of the inferior larynx, Savart divided the recurrent nerve on one side in the living bird, after which it continued to sing with all the modi- fications of its melody as before. We agree as to the duplex office of the lower larynx in singing birds ; but in them the semilunar membrane appears common to both sides, as is also the os transversale. Savart considered the semilunar membrane to be chiefly de- veloped in those birds which have the most reedy quality of voice, the speaking birds for instance, such as the jays, pies, &c., but that, in the production of the flute tones in singing birds, it is more relaxed, and the glottis more open. He observes that, in making a trans- verse section of the trachea in the living bird, which also cuts the recurrent nerve, and pro- duces a relaxed state of the glottis, the sounds become less ' criard,' and less 'sourd' ; but, as birds thus maltreated suffer greatly, he recommends the section of the recurrent nerve only. It is one of the most difficult subjects in acoustics to determine theoretically the sound which many of the male Natatores ought to produce, such, for example, as the Anas domesticus, A. clangula, Mergus serrator, and M. merganser, the structure of whose la- rynges has been briefly describedand, when we consider that these larynges are composed of chambers of varied dimensions, bounded by walls partly membranous and partly osseous, the membranes being of unequal area, and perhaps unequal tension, we may have some notion of the extreme difficulty of the inquiry, when some of the greatest mathematicians of the past and present age have as yet been un- able to determine analytically the law of the vibration of a single piece of stretched parch- ment, like the drum. Experiment shows that a single membranous stretched disc will produce many other, be- sides its fundamental and harmonic sounds ; we need not, therefore, be surprised at the discordant tones which many of theNatatores are well known to produce. The reason why short tubes, such as the tracheas of many small birds, produce tones of a very grave pitch, has already been satisfactorily explained by Savart. We observe, however, that, in those birds in which the trachea is shortest, the diameter smallest, and the walls very elastic, the voice is most acute. The muscles which vary the tension of the walls of the vocal pipe are in continual action during the modulation of the voice, in order to adjust the tube of the trachea to the pitch of the glottis; but the number of vibrations is doubtless determined by the glottis, and reinforced by the walls of the pipe, as in Mammalia. The cavities in the trachea of some of the Natatores must certainly influence the timbre, or qua- lity of the voice of those birds. In the com- mon crane, and other birds which have a con- voluted trachea, the tones ought to be grave in proportion to its length, if the number of vibrations is determined by the length, as in musical instruments. The voice of birds, as of other animals, is always in a minor key ; but to describe the melody of each bird would be foreign to our subject. The range of notes is generally within an octave, though they can greatly exceed it. In the parrots, which have a voice of great power, the inferior larynx is single. The two membranes of the larynx leave a narrow chink between them, through which the air is forced from the lungs. These membranes, vibrating in all their dimensions, produce that harsh and disagreeable quality of sound peculiar to them. They can also whistle, during which the glottis is probably silent, and the column of air vibrates as in a flute, when a vibratory move- ment being communicated by the air, traverses the elastic walls of the tube. Besides the power of speech possessed by some birds, many can imitate almost every sound they hear. The blackbird has been known to imi- tate the song of the nightingale, the crowing of the common cock, and the cackle of the hen ; the jay is said to mock the notes of the green- finch and the neighing of the horse so closely, that it was scarcely believed to be a bird by those who heard it; also the calling of fowls to their food, and the barking of the house dog. The sounds uttered by birds are so various that to describe them physiologically in detail would occupy a volume ; let it therefore suf- fice, in concluding this section of our article, to mention that the voice of birds has been made the theme not only of the naturalist, but also of numerous eminent writers both in prose and verse. Voice ok Reptiles. — The mechanism of the vocal organs in reptiles presents very diver- sified forms. The larynx varies considerably in structure, not only in different orders, but in different genera of the same family. It would therefore be impossible to compress within the limits assigned to this article the1502 VOICE. minute anatomy of the several species ; they have been recently investigated and detailed in a monograph by Henle. Sauria.— In the Crocodile the larynx is com- posed of three cartilages, namely, the thy- roid and cricoid consolidated into one ring- formed cartilage, called the thyro-cricoid, and the two arytenoid cartilages. The basi-hyoid element of the hyoid bone is expanded into a disc; and lies in front of the larynx, which it protects and supports. The arytenoid car- tilages are connected with the superior margin of the thyro-cricoid by a membranous suture, but nothing approaching to a joint furnished with ligaments and synovial membrane is ob- servable. The mucous membrane of the larynx is reflected over the inferior margins of the arytenoid cartilages, and forms a deep pouch beneath them, leaving a free fold with a margin on each side; so that, when these cartilages are brought near each other, this fold forms the vocal cord, and produces the tones peculiar to the Alligators In the Ca- me/eon the larynx is provided with a sac in front, similar to that observed in some of the Quadrumana. The air passes to and from this sac by means of an opening, lying between the lower margin of the larynx and the first ring of the trachea. The larynx of this ani- mal has been very minutely described by Treviranus. Some reptiles have a membrane at the base of the tongue, which answers to the epiglottis ; others have a cartilaginous epiglottis ; others again a mere bony or cartilaginous processus epiglotticus, as in birds. " But," observes Henle, " the presence of this process does not imply that there is no epiglottis, or con- versely, the presence of an epiglottis that there is no processus epiglotticus." Cuvier de- scribed five cartilages in the larynx of the crocodile, but it is now generally admitted that he was mistaken. The vocal cords are more perfectly deve- loped in the Gecko, and the cameleon, than in the crocodile. They are broad membranous folds passing from the bases of the arytenoid car- tilages to the innersurface of the crico-thyroid. In the Lacerta a very thin membranous fold is found passing from the bases of these car- tilages in the position of the vocal ligaments; but Henle is of opinion that the acute chirp- ing tone of the lizard depends rather on the vibration of the margins of the glottis, than on these folds, which are incapable of being approximated to each other, or brought into a state of tension. Chelonia.—The vocal organs of the Chelonia are not adapted for perfect intonation of the breath, being destitute of vocal cords. The superior portion of the larynx is surrounded by, and connected with the basi-hyoid element of the os hyoides as in the Sauria. In the Emys, and the Tesludo, the thyroid cartilage is annular, and distinct from the cricoid ; the arytenoids are triangular, and the internal surface is much enlarged, owing to the very concave form of the larynx. In the Midas, the aditus laryngis is furnished with a fold of mucous membrane, which serves for the pro- duction of certain sounds. In the great tor- toise of Madagascar, Cuvier describes a tri- angular membranous crest attached to the base of the larynx which, ascending to its opening, divides it into two parts, and is analogous to what is found in the superior larynx of some birds. Meckel found the same kind of crest in T. tabulala, but it is absent in T. GrcBca and several other species. The muscles of the larynx are the constrictor, and the dilator aditus laryngis. Ophidia.— In this class the larynx is very little developed, with regard either to volume or to mechanism. The upper rings of the trachea are consolidated into a crico-thyroid cartilage, to which the arytenoids are attached. In some species these are sessile, mere pro- cesses of the crico-thyroid ; and in others, they are divided from it by a suture, but in the pythons and boas they are free. The processus epiglotticus is nearly quadrangular in the Boa: the vocal cords are absent, and therefore the voice is reduced to a mere hissing sound, which is produced by the breath passing over the edges of the aditus laryngis. The muscles of the larynx are the elevator, depressor, di- lator, and compressor laryngis. Batrachia. — In the Batrachia the two arytenoid cartilages form a considerable por- tion of the frame of the larynx, and the cri- coid, with a few exceptions, is a complete ring. The arytenoids are triangular, and their apices being upwards form the superior lateral boundaries of the larynx. The vocal cords pass from end to end of the bases of the triangles. According to Henle, the whole of the tailless Batrachia, except the Pipa and the Dac- ti/lelhro, have vocal cords. In Bufo there are two pairs of vocal cords (Jig. 919), correspond- ing to the inferior vocal cords in Mammalia. Fig. 919. Bufo. a, and b, semilunar folds of the superior vocal cord ; c. inferior vocal cord ; d, luug. Above and below the vocal cords there are sacs lined with mucous membrane, and bounded by the arytenoid cartilages. Between the vocal cords a small cartilage is sometimes found.1503 In Bombinalor igncus, Hyla verrucosa, and others, the arytenoid cartilages are regular obtuse-angled, and nearly equilateral triangles. In B. cincreus they are more acute-angled, and directed backwards. The vocal cords in bufo are very thin elastic membranes, sucli as might be expected to produce the croaking deep tones of these batrachia. In Pbpa the larynx is a very peculiar piece of mechanism ; the arytenoid cartilages being convex externally and concave internally, so that when the entrance to the larynx is closed they form a dome over the windpipe, which Cuvier has compared to a kettle-drum. In Rana temporaria, R.esculentu, and Hyla, the males are provided with two sacs, which open by a straight canal into the larynx. These sacs are situated on each side of the lower jaw, and are capable of considerable distension, when filled with air during the cry of the animal. Cuvier, Roesel, and Blumenbach, describe only one sac in Hyla ; but Meckel, as well as Henle and myself, found two sacs, as in the other frogs. These sacs doubt- less exert a powerful influence on the quality of the sounds which frogs utter, analogous to the influence of similar sacs which exist in many of the higher animals. Fig. 920. Rana temporaria. a, tongue; b, os hyoides ; c, superior vocal cords; d, inferior vocal cords; e, pharynx; f, right bronchus. The muscles acting on the larynx in Batra- chia are the dilator aditus laryngis and the constrictor aditus. Besides these, there is found in the tailless Batrachia a third muscle, the compressor glottidis, which in Bi ito arises from the columella*, and is inserted into the posterior point of the arytenoid cartilage. Its use is to compress the larynx, to bend the posterior angle of the arytenoid outwards, and to expand the vocal ligament. It is the most important muscle connected with the voice in the tailless Batrachia. Its course varies in different species, and is absent altogether in Pipa. * One of the inferior processes of the os hyoides. In Proteus anguinus the most simple form of cartilaginous larynx is found, consisting of lateral cartilaginous strips, divided in two on each side ; the superior portion answering to the arytenoid cartilage of the higher orders of animals, the inferior to the laryngo-trachealis cartilages. In the Triton, and Salamander, the larynx consists of a membranous sac, which is kept open by the lateral cartilages of the vocal tube. Hence we learn that the arytenoid cartilages do not wholly disappear, until the larynx be- comes entirely membranous. Insecta. — A large number of insects are mute; some produce their sounds merely by friction, and others by the passage of the air through the thoracic spiracles. The sounds produced by friction are denominated stridu- iation ; those by the air from the tracheae, buzzing, or humming (bourdonnement), &c. Organs adapted to produce stridulation are found in the Orthoptera, Omoptera, and some of the Coleoptera. Grylli.—In the Gryllus cavqwslris (fig. 021) the elytrum is composed of dry, thin, trans- lucent membranes, forming two planes, united and strengthened at their junction by four longitudinal and parallel nervures ; one of these planes lies on the back, and the other on the side of the insect. The former of these planes is divided by a series of regularly curved nervures, into a number of areoles. The musical apparatus may- be divided into two systems, the first com- posed of four oblique nervures, which ter- minate in a strong nervure, serrated like a file (a) ; this may be considered as the bow. The second is formed of three nervures, which take their origin in a remarkable point in the internal border of the elytrum, furnished with a tuft of short stiff hairs, or brush (6); above this point is found a firm, transparent, and nearly triangular disc or sounding plate *, surrounded by a nervure. When the insect cries, the wings are crossed, and the bow rubbed rapidly across the whole length of the Fig. 921. 1. 2. Elytra of Gryltus campestris. disc or sounding plate, whereby the whole of both elytra are put in a state of vibration, and the stridulous sounds peculiar to these grylli result. The pitch of the sound of the house cricket is very acute, being equivalent to about 4096 vibrations in a second. Cicada, Cigales.— The Cicadae have their musical instruments inclosed in the interior of the abdomen. Reaumur gives a detailed description, illustrated by drawings, by which they may readily be recognised. These in- struments, he says, are contained in the abdo- * Termed by M. Goureau the "chanterelle."1504 VOICE. minal cavity, divided into two cells by a scaly partition of a triangular form, covered by two cartilaginous plates, acting as shutters or opercula. When viewed from the abdominal surface, each cell presents exteriorly a white folded membrane with radiated reflections, which he terms the mirror. On opening from the upper surface the part of the abdomen corresponding to the cavity, we perceive on each side a plaited membrane, dry and sono- rous, which is moved by a powerful muscle, composed of straight parallel fibres springing from the scaly partition ; this membrane is the tymbal. In order to bring into play an instru- ment so complicated, Reaumur states that the insect alternately contracts and relaxes the muscle attached to the tymbal, and by this means produces the sound. He believes that " this sound is augmented in the drum, and that this portion of the vocal organ has no other use than to give it brilliancy." He also imagines " that the trochanter of the haunch performs the office of a curb, and prevents the operculum from being too much elevated during the song. Some doubts have arisen with regard to this simple explanation of the song of the Cicada?, and entomologists have concluded that the air performs an important part in the formation of the voice, and that it is due, at least in a great measure, to a rapid current issuing from the stigmata of the meta- thorax, which resounds within the organs above described." The humming, or buzzing of Insects.— It has been supposed by some entomologists that the hum of insects is produced by the os- cillations of their wings during flight, and this supposition is strengthened by the fact that the tones are altered during the suspension of the insects in the air, and that the sound becomes more acute when the tips of the wings are removed. This hypothesis will not, how- ever, bear the test of rigid investigation. It was observed by John Hunter, " that in- sects emitted sounds after their wings were cut off.* De Geerf, finding that after he had cut off the wings, winglets, and poisers, the buzzing continued, placed the insect under a microscope, and observing that the stumps of the wings were in rapid motion, he pulled them off" by the roots, on which the buzzing ceased •, and hence he inferred that the sound was produced b\ the vibrations of the wings. But it is not surprising that insects, after such mutilation cease to emit any sound. Bur- meister j is of opinion that the sounds of some Diptera, such as Tabanns bovinus, are produced by a stream of air rapidly transmitted through the thoracic air-holes during flight. He has described and figured the mechanism of the thorax and the air-holes of the Eristalis tenax, which is as follows:—The aperture of the hinder air-hole is provided with a sphincter muscle, perpendicular to the inner surface of which are sixteen or eighteen horny lamella?, of the same breadth as the muscle, and connected in * Phil. Trans. 1792. t Vol. ii. p. 13. % Art xvi. p 377. Taylor's Scientific Memoirs. the middle by another longitudinal horny band. The sphincter muscle is lined with a membrane clothed with feathery hairs, which cover the air-hole like a sieve, and exclude foreign bodies. He leaves it to naturalists to decide whether or not this mechanism contributes to the form- ation of the sound ; adding that either way it is of little consequence, as many insects have no such lamellae. He observes that when the insect sits or crawls it breathes through the air-holes of the abdomen,but during flight through those of the thorax. He considers the hum of insects to be in reality a whistle. The pitch of this hum is hitherto unexplained, although it is quite certain that it does not depend upon the number of the vibrations of the wings, for in a favourable light the motion of the wings of many insects, whose hum is of a high pitch, can be clearly detected; but, if that pitch were owing to the vibrations of the wings, their number would necessarily be so great as to render the motion imperceptible.* The author has recently examined, with Professor Queekett, the spiracles of other insects, such as the blue-bottle fly, and the humble bee, and has discovered in them a beautifully organised valvular opening, capable of producing the sounds which these insects emit during flight, f In fig. 922. is shown one of the large thoracic spiracles of a blow fly (Musca vumitoria); it consists of two valves, one much larger than the other, each Fig. 922. Timracic spiracle of the blow-fly, Musca vomitoria. being provided with numerous branching horny filaments or hairs which serve as a support to the thin membrane forming the valve ; a somewhat similar form of spiracle occurs in the humble bee, (fig. 923). The valves are nearly of equal size, and the branching hairs are much stronger and more numerous than those in the blow fly. * Those who wish to pursue the subject further may consult the second note to p. 425. art. Motion., f The pitch of the blue-bottle fly ranges, in different species, from 288 to 341 vibrations in a second.1505 WRIST-JOINT (Normal Anatomy). Besides stridulation, and humming, some insects, such as hees, emit a cry, or, as the French entomologists term it, piaulemcnt. M. Goureau supposes this variety of voice to be used, when bees swarm preparatory to their emigration. He remarks that those insects which produce the sound by friction arc not singers, but musicians; and that insects in general make use of their voices to communi- cate certain ideas and sensations. Fig. 923. Thoracic spii-acle of the Humble Bee (Bombus terrestris). In insects we find a great diversity of beau- tifully contrived mechanism for the modula- tion of sound, all answering the same end in the economy of these countless myriads of minute beings.

WRIST-JOINT (Radio-carpal Articula- tion'), Normal Anatomy ov the. — The ar- ticulation of the wrist results from the union of the bones of the lore-arm with those of the hand, and is constituted by the contact of the lower surfaces of the radius and of the trian- gular interarticular cartilage with the sca- phoid, lunar, and cuneiform bones of the carpus. The radius and the triangular fibro- cartilage accordingly present a uniformly smooth and slightly concave surface, whilst the first three bones of the carpus afford a surface which is as uniformly convex. The transverse measurement of these articular surfaces is greater than the antero-posterior, since the former averages one inch and a half in the adult male, whilst the latter scarcely exceeds three quarters of an inch. In this joint are found all the anatomical dispositions which characterize other arthro- dial articulations : the bones are invested with cartilage, lined by a synovial membrane, and present smooth surfaces which deviate but slightly from being planiform ; and lastly, the ligaments connecting the osseous surfaces are so disposed, as to admit of all the free gliding motions which are indispensable to the hand as an organ of touch and of prehension. It is proposed in this article to describe, seriatim, the different structures which enter into the composition of the radio-carpal articulation, with their relative anatomy, but for a detailed account of the surgical anatomy of the region of the wrist, the reader is re- ferred to the article Hand, where this subject has been fully entered into. I. The Bones which constitute the wrist-joint. a. The Radius. — The lower end of the radius, which is of a quadrilateral form, is curved so as to present a concavity ante- riorly, and a convexity in the opposite direction. On its different aspects various objects of interest present themselves to view, which may be thus enumerated: — Anteriorly is seen a smooth surface, to which the ten- dons of the flexor muscles, surrounded by their synovial sheath, are applied ; ^jos/en'or/y, a series of depressions and irregular elevations are observable, the former of which indicate the course of different tendons passing to the hand. Of these depressions the most ex- ternal is a broad but shallow groove, which lodges the tendons of the radial extensors of the carpus: to its inner side, hut separated from it by a well-marked ridge, is a narrow deep groove, which runs obliquely down- wards and outwards, and transmits in this 5 DWRIST-JOINT (Normal Anatomy). 1506 direction the tendon of the extensor secundi intemodii pollicis. The remainder of the dorsal aspect of the radius is subjacent to the tendons of the m. extensor digitorum com- munis and the extensor indicis. The outer surface of the lower extremity of the radius is the least extensive, and is furnished with a shallow groove, which affords insertion to the tendon of the supinator longus, and gives passage to the tendons of two of the extensor muscles of the thumb, viz., the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis and extensor primi inter- nodii pollicis. This surface is terminated inferiorly by the styloid process, which lies on a plane a little posterior to the last-mentioned groove : lastly, the inner surface of this por- tion of the bone presents a smooth concave surface of oval form, its long axis directed from before backwards, which serves for arti- culation with the head of the ulna, and enters into the formation of the inferior radio-ulnar articulation. By its inferior surface, the radius is adapted for articulation with the carpus. The aspect of the surface, owing to the curvature of the radius already indicated, is downwards and forwards, whilst at the same time it is directed slightly inwards, from its external boundary passing lower than the internal. The inferior surface of the radius presents a triangular outline, the apex of which is placed externally at the styloid process, whilst the base, in the opposite direction, is consti- tuted by the sharp margin separating the inferior from the internal articular surface on the radius, and serving for the attachment of the broad extremity of the radio-ulnar inter- articular cartilage (triangular fibro cartilage). The two margins which border this inferior articulating surface of the radius serve for the attachment of ligaments, and of these the anterior is the most prominent. Lastly, the carpal surface of the radius is divided into two portions by a ridge, which traverses it from before backwards: the external of these articular " facettes" is triangular in shape, and adapted to the scaphoid bone, whilst the more internal of the two is quadrilateral, and articulates with the semilunar carpal bone. It has been mentioned that the radius at its lower extremity undergoes a change of form, and that from being cylindrical higher up, it becomes here quadrilateral. This ex- pansion of its surface takes place at the expense of its solidity, for a section of the bone shows that inferiorly the compact tissue is extremely thin, whilst the cancellated tissue is in proportion more abundant. This circumstance is adduced, as in some measure explaining the frequency of fracture in this situation, an accident notoriously common. The ulna is excluded from the articulation of the wrist by the triangular fibro-cartilage, which stretches across transversely between the head of the ulna above and the carpus inferiorly, and presents a surface concave in each direction. The inferior surface of this fibro-cartilage is on the same plane with the inferior surface of the radius, and constitutes with it the superior articulating surface of the wrist-joint. The entire of this conjoint surface is some- what oval (or diamond-shaped), and is limited externally and internally by the styloid pro- cesses of the radius and ulna respectively. b. The Scaplwid, Semilunar, and Cuneiform Bones of the Carpus. — The Carpus, superiorly, presents a surface which is pretty uniformly convex. That convexity, however, is slightly interrupted by the undulating lines resulting from the lateral articulations between the bones which compose it. The convexity of the upper surface of the scaphoid bone is triangular in form, and articu- lates with the outer facette on the inferior surface of the radius; the semilunar bone is quadrilateral in conformity with the shape of the inner facette of the radius, whilst the cuneiform bone presents a surface of a trian- gular form, by which it comes accurately into apposition with the inferior surface of the radio-ulnar interarticular cartilage. The aspect of the radial or upper conjoint surface of those three bones is directed upwards and slightly backwards. II. The Ligaments. — These are placed on each of the several aspects of the wrist, and are usually designated from their position,— the anterior, the posterior, and the lateral radio-carpal ligaments. But whilst the wrist- joint is thus protected on its different aspects by ligamentous bands, it is to be observed that no distinct intervals naturally separate these ligaments from one another, so that it might with strict propriety be said that the articulation of the wrist is defended by a ligamentous envelope of a capsular form, strengthened in particular parts, but more especially laterally by other superimposed and superadded fibres. a. Anterior Radio-carpal Ligament. — The fibres of this ligament are connected superiorly to the anterior margin of the lower end of the radius and of its styloid process, and to the " triangular ligament," from whence they radiate to their insertion into the anterior surfaces of the scaphoid, semilunar, and cunei- form bones. Below, they are partly con- tinuous with the fibrous fasciculi (interosseous ligament), which connect the two rows of carpal bones. The fibres of the anterior radio-carpal ligament pursue a direction for the most part downwards and inwards. By its anterior surface this ligament is in relation with the tendons of the deep flexor muscles, and also (but more remotely), with those of the superficial flexor, and with the median nerve, the entire surrounded by an extensive and complicated synovial apparatus. Beneath these structures, and immediately in front of the ligament, is the anastomosis, between the anterior radial and the anterior ulnar carpal arteries, which also receive tribu- taries from the descending branches of the interosseal, and the ascending of the deep palmar arch of arteries. b. Posterior Radio-carpal Ligament.—ThisWRIST-JOINT. (Normal Anatomy). 1.007 5 d 2 ligament much resembles the one last de- scribed. Arising from the posterior edge of the carpal end of the radius, its fibres pass downwards and inwards to the back of the carpus, where they expand and take an ex- tensive attachment to the three inner bones of the first range. The tendons of the ex- tensor muscles of the fingers are related to the superficial surface of this ligament, wliicli has also in contact with it the posterior carpal arteries from the radial and ulnar trunks. The anterior and posterior ligaments are connected, both externally and internally, with the lateral ligaments, so that no portion of the periphery of the articulation is devoid of ligamentous covering c. External Lateral Ligament of the Wrist- Joint.—The external lateral ligament is funi- cular in form, and connects the styloid process of the radius with the scaphoid and trapezium, the two most external of the carpal bones. The direction of its fibres is downwards and backwards. The radial artery crosses ob- liquely over the external surface of this liga- ment, and separates it from the tendons of the extensor ossis metacarpi and the extensor primi internodii pollicis. The synovial mem- brane lines its inner surface. When the hand is fully adducted, this ligament is put upon the stretch. d. The internal lateral ligament.—This li- gament is larger and longer than the pre- ceding ; for, notwithstanding the greater length of its styloid process, the ulna is more widely separated from the carpus than is the radius. This ligament connects the styloid process of the ulna with the cuneiform bone, giving a fasciculus to the fusiform bone and to the anterior annular ligament. The tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris is posterior and parallel to ttrs ligament. The internal lateral ligament limits abduction, so as to render it the least extensive of all the motions enjoyed by the wrist joint. III. Synovia! Membrane. — The synovial membrane of the wrist joint is very extensive, and contains a large quantity of synovia. Its anatomical disposition is so simple as not to require any special notice ; but it may be of practical importance to remember the prox- imity of this structure to the synovial sacs between the lateral articulations of the carpal bones, and also its contiguity to the articula- tion between the trapezium and the first metacarpal bone. The former circumstance explains the facility with which acute inflam- mation, occurring in the smaller carpal articu- lations as the result of irnparonvchia, may be propagated to the contiguous wrist joint, where, too frequently, the morbid action thus excited proves destructive to the articulation. The latter circumstance demands our atten- tion, since it teaches that, in amputating at the first carpo-metacarpal articulation a care- less use of the knife may inflict a wound upon the wrist joint itself, from which the most serious consequences ma)' accrue. The synovial membrane of the wrist joint is separated from that of the inferior radio- ulnar articulation by the triangular interarti- cular cartilage. In amputating at the wrist joint, if care be taken to leave the inter- articular cartilage uninjured, the motions of pronation and of supination will be left to the forearm, and may therefore be communicated to the artificial substitute for the amputated hand. In this respect, the amputation through the joint offers an advantage which is sacrificed when amputation is performed through the continuity of the bones of the forearm. IV. Mechanical Functions. — The wrist- joint enjoys every variety of motion included under the head of gliding motions (Bichat) ; thus it is capable offlexion, extension, adduc- tion, abduction, and circumduction. In the motions of'flexion and of extension, the carpus rolls either forwards or backwards on the lower articular surface of the radius. Flexion is limited, not only by the posterior ligament, but also by the lateral ligaments which are attached behind the centre of motion of the articulation. Extension is limited by the an- terior ligament only. In adduction and abduc- tion the carpal bones glide from side to side on the surface opposed to them. Of these motions abduction is the more limited, be- cause, probably, the sty loitl process of the radius and the trapezium come sooner into mutual contact than the corresponding parts at the inner side of the joint do. In circumduction (a motion compounded of all the preceding ones), the hand moves through a circle re- presenting the base of a hollow cone, the apex of which is at the joint. The free gliding of the carpal bones on each other causes this movement to appear more extensive than it is in reality, whilst it gives all that ease and grace to the movements of the wrist which are in so especial a manner its characteristics. The wrist joint thus constituted would not, d priori, be supposed to enjoy that remarkable immunity from accidental luxation which must be conceded to it. In truth, this articu- lation owes its remarkable strength and its freedom from accidental displacements to the mass of tendons which occupy its anterior and posterior surfaces principally, not to its ligamentous connections, nor to the form of its osseous surfaces. Those tendons, like so many vital ligaments kept tense as well by the tonic as by the active contraction of their muscles, and bound down by the annular liga- ments, bear off, in a great degree, all violent shocks from the joint itself, whilst, by their antagonistic resistance to each other, they at the same time maintain the bones in accurate contact. But whilst, owing to these circumstances, the impetus of shocks applied to the hand are borne off from the articulation of the wrist, they fall in many instances with resistless force upon the lower end of the radius, which, owing to the thinness of its compact- tissue, is ill adapted for opposing an effectual resistance. It has already been shown that the ulna is but indirectly connected with the carpus ; and that a layer of highly-elastic tissueWRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1508 intervenes between the carpus and that bone. These circumstances taken in connection with the remarkable mobility of the lower radio- ulnar articulation sufficiently explain why the ulna so frequently escapes injury from forces which act on the hand, and which suffice to fracture the radius. At the same time it is to be observed, that displacements of the lower extremity of the ulna are by no means unfre- quent accompaniments of fractures of the radius. (Benjamin Geo. M'DoiveL) WRIST, Abnormal Conditions of.— In the following account of the abnormal con- dition of the different structures which enter into the composition of the wrist, we shall consider this region as formed not only by the lower extremities of the bones of the forearm and the wrist-joint, properly so called, but also by the carpus surrounded by its fibrous and fibro-synovial tissues. The abnormal condition of the different structures of this region may be arranged un- der those which we can refer—1st, to conge- nital malformation; 2nd, to accident; and 3rd, to disease. Congenital. — Congenital dislocation of the bones which constitute the radio-carpal articulation may be considered rare; never- theless, I have seen within these few years thirteen examples of this malformation. One, in which the bones of the forearm were thrown forwards and the carpus backwards. In the remaining twelve cases, the bones of the forearm were placed on the dorsum of the carpus, which they overlapped. The history of congenital luxations of the wrist-joint is modern. Cruveilhier, in his Pathological Anatomy (liv. ix., 1833), has published an example of this deformity, al- though he was not himself aware of the true nature of the case. The example he adduces is that of an adult female, concerning whose history, unfortunately, he could learn nothing. In this case the forearm was preternaturally short, and it formed a right-angle with the hand, which besides was inclined to the radial side of the forearm; extension was im- possible; flexion, to a certain degree, was per- mitted ; the inferior extremities of the radius and ulna were dislocated backwards, and formed a very considerable prominence be- neath the skin posteriorly. The extremity of the radius was less salient, and descended much less than that of the ulna. The superior extremity of the carpus could be felt on a plane which was superior and ante- rior to that of the inferior extremity of the bones of the forearm. Dissection.— The bones of the carpus were found on dissection to be in a state of atrophy, and more or less malformed ; the radius, short- ened and deformed, scarcely measured five inches; the deformity principally affected its lower extremity, which was large and deeply grooved posteriorly for the reception of the tendons of the extensor muscles; the articular surface for the carpus was placed on the an- terior aspect of the bone; the ulna was only six inches and a half in length, its lower ex - tremity, much smaller than normal, descended half an inch below the carpal extremity of the radius. Forearm, Cruveithier,s case. The carpus was much deformed, particu- larly as to the first row, which was merely, we may say, in a rudimentary state. The pisi- form was the only bone of this first range that was normal. The bones of the second or metacarpal row participated in the deformity. The head of the os magnum was altogether absent, and the unciform was imperfect. Cruveilhier published the foregoing case, erroneously supposing it an example of dislo- cation of the wrist-joint, the result of accident. Dupuytren and Marjolin disagreed with Cru- veilhier, but equally mistook the true nature of this case; they, doubting the possibility of an accidental luxation of the wrist-joint, con- sidered that all the phenomena which the post-mortem examination of the limb presented in Cruveilhier's example, might be accounted for by supposing the case to have been one of fracture of the radius, and consecutive dis- placement of the ulna. It must ever appear as a matter of surprise that Cruveilhier could have supposed that this case just adduced was an old accidental luxa- tion left unreduced, because, according to such an hypothesis, neither the arrest of develop- ment as to the length of the forearm (which only measured six inches and a half), nor the abnormal appearances observed in the bones of the carpus, could have been satisfactorily accounted for, or explained. It is equally difficult to imagine how it was that Dupuytren, who had his attention so much alive to the subject of congenital luxa- tions, should have overlooked the true nature of Cruveilhier's case, and referred the pheno- mena it presented to the circumstance of the radius having been broken through its lower epiphysis; no one ever heard of shortening of the radius to this amount as the result of frac- ture ; besides, the bones on the carpus were in a state of atrophy, and the ulna, which Du-1509 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 5 d 3 puytren did not suppose had been fractured, for the last seventeen years. She is liable to was deformed, and only six inches and a half long. At the period when this case, the subject of so much difference of opinion between two such eminent pathologists, attracted the atten- tion of the profession in Dublin, the writer had under his care, in the House of Industry, a patient who was born with deformity of both her wrist-joints and forearms, but whose right wrist-joint presented appearances closely resembling those described as characterising the deformity of the wrist and forearm in Cruveilhier's case. As the history of this woman's case was known from her birth, it was calculated to throw light on the subject in dispute. It seemed on this and other ac- counts so interesting, that on the 15th of De- cember, 1838, 1 laid it before the Pathological Society in Dublin. It was as follows : — Case II. — Deborah O'Neil, aged thirty, has been an inmate of the House of Industry, occasional attacks of epilepsy. She cannot be said to be insane, but she is wayward and refractory, and will not submit to any rational control. Yet she is very industrious. Her upper arms and hands bear in size and length a just proportion to the rest of her stature, winch is about the middle size, but her fore- arms appear scarcely more than half their normal length. Her left forearm is dislocated forward at the radio-carpal joint, while the right forearm is dislocated, as in the preceding figure, back- ward on the dorsum of the carpus. The lower extremities of the bones of the right forearm could be seen and felt on the dorsum of the carpus, where they formed a very remarkable projection. The lowest ex- tremity of the ulna could be seen to descend below the level of the lowest extremity of the dislocated radius, and when the hand of the patient was flexed could be made very promi- Fis. 925.

When the surgeon introduced his fingers in front of the wrist-joint, and made a slight extension of the hand, the superior extremity of the carpus could be felt to be placed superiorly and ante- riorly to the lowest extremities of the bones of the forearm. The hand inclined to the radial side, it could be extended on the fore- arm freely, but flexion was incomplete. The left wrist-joint presented an unique example of dislocation of the bones of the forearm exactly in the opposite direction to those already described. The forearm was thrown forwards, and the carpus with the hand on tiie back of the radius and ulna {Jig. 926.). This woman presented a very grotesque ap- pearance in consequence of the remarkable shortness of both her forearms (Jigs. 920. and 927.) ; still she had a very good use of her hands, and showed admirable dexterity and skill in cutting out minute patterns on paper with her scissors.1510 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). As to this case of Deborah O'Neil, no am- biguity existed. At the time the writer thus laid her case before the meeting, accompanied by casts of her forearms, she was, and had been for many years previously, an inmate in the House of Industry, under the constant observation of the whole medical staff of the institution. The history of her life was known. Left Forearm. Case of O'Neil. It was stated that she never met with any accident, and that the peculiar deformity observable in each forearm and wrist-joint had existed from her birth. The writer, in continuation, observed, that while congenital malformation was known very frequently to affect simultaneously both sides of the body, yet it would, on the other hand, be very difficult for any one to suggest what pro- bable accidental causes could be imagined capable of dislocating the bones of both wrist- joints, in opposite directions, as in the case of O'Neil: besides, the mere displacement of the bones of both forearms at the wrist-joint, con- stituted only a part of the abnormal state of things noticed, because both of the forearms were so short as to measure only half the length of the arm, and did not exceed in length the measurement of the long axis of the hand. The history of her case, then, from her birth — the negative evidence as to the existence of any previous accidental cause adequate to ac- count for the appearances, and the actual abnormal condition of both the upper extre- mities of O'Neil—all taken together, suffi- ciently proved her case to offer a curious spe- cimen of congenital malformation of both wrist-joints and forearms." When the writer presented this case to the meeting of the Pathological Society, he laid before the members two casts of the mal- formed extremities of the patient, and when the drawing of Cruveilhier's case {pi. 2. liv. ix.), was placed along side of the cast of the right forearm of O'Neil, every one [ire- sent agreed in the opinion that the cast pre- sented an exact counter-part of Cruveilhier's drawing (Jig. 924.). Deborah O'Neil, five years subsequently to this date, died suddenly of apoplexy, in the Government Asylum, Island Bridge. Dr. R W. Smith, the surgeon of the institution, made a post mortem examination of the affected arti- culations. The result fully proved, as had been anticipated, that her right wrist-joint in every respect resembled the remarkable case brought forward by Cruveilhier. Post Mortem Examination.—Upon the 15th of December, 1843, Mr. Smith exhibited bej fore a meeting of the Dublin Pathologica Society, the skeleton of the limb in this case. The right extremity presented an example of luxation of the carpus forwards, while in the left was afforded an instance of displace- ment of the carpus backwards. Eight Extremity. — The upper arm and hand, as already mentioned, bore a just pro- portion to each other, and to the stature of the individual, but the forearms were scarcely one half the usual length. The first range of the carpus was articulated with the anterior aspect of the radius, which bone was only Fig. 927. Skeleton of Right Forearm. Case of O'Neil. (After Smith.) four inches and a half in length (fig. 927.). The ulna, six inches in length, was prolonged below the radius nearly half an inch, its lowerWRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1511 5 d 4 extremity was destitute of tlie rounded head, which in the normal state is received into the concavity of the radius, and was carried for- wards outwards and upwards (see fig. 927.). About half an inch above the level of its lower extremity it was in contact with the radius by a very small surface which was destitute of cartilage. An anterior and pos- terior ligament connected the two bones in this situation, and permitted a very slight degree of motion between them. The lower extremity of the radius was totally destitute of articulating surface, and was represented by a rounded and blunt margin. The surface for articulation with the carpus was placed altogether on the anterior aspect of the bone. It consisted of a deep excava- tion of an oblong form, and its longest diame- ter running somewhat transversely ; it was tolerably smooth, though not invested with cartilage. The radius and ulna were not only remark- ably short, but likewise atrophied, both as to breadth and thickness. Their superior extremities, with the excep- tion of being unusually small, presented no abnormal appearance. The bones of the first row of the carpus were in a state of atrophy, especially the semi-lunar bone. When the hand was flexed at a right angle with the forearm, the lower end of the ulna formed a most conspicuous projection, while during extension, two pro- minences were seen ; one, in front, caused by the carpus, the other posteriorly, mark- ing the position of the lower extremities of the bones of the forearm. The hand was inclined to the radial side of the forearm ; it admitted of being flexed to a right angle, and could be extended perfectly. The ex- tensor tendons in their passage from the forearm to the hand were lodged in deep and narrow grooves, or channels, formed on the dorsal aspect of the radius. Upon the left side the deformity was equally remarkable, although the reverse of that no- ticed on the right side. The carpus was re- ceived into a socket formed for it by the radius and ulna. This socket was not at the lowest extremity of the bones of the forearm but near to it, and on the dorsal aspect of the bones, and it presented somewhat a glenoid shape, the longest diameter of which was directed obliquely downwards and in- wards. With respect to the carpus, there was neither a scaphoid nor semi-lunar bone. The hand placed in the state of extension formed a right angle with the forearm, but the patient had the power of bringing it to a straight line with the latter, in which position two prominences were seen ; but, contrary to what was observed on the opposite side, the dorsal projection was here formed by the carpus, the extremities of the radius and ulna con- stituting the palmar eminences (see Jig. 927.). In this left extremity, the carpus and forearm, including the elbow joint, were malformed, as well as the wrist-joint, but the rest of the skeleton, with the exception of the right wrist-joint and forearm, was quite normal. Case III. — Case of congenital luxation of the wrist-joint of both bones of the left fore- arm hackwards. The writer exhibited to a meeting of the Surgical Society of Dublin, on March i20th, 1847, the cast of the left forearm of an adult female, who had been born with a luxation of the carpal extremity of both the bones of the left forearm backwards. The lower ex- tremities of the radius and ulna were placed completely on the dorsum of the carpus, while the hand was, consequently, situated in the front of these bones. This remarkable cast of congenital luxa- tion of the wrist-joint was sent across the Atlantic by Dr. R. MacDonnell, now holding, as a surgeon of the Montreal Hospital, a distinguished place in British America. We observe that in the casts (figs. 928. and 929., the representations of Dr. R. MacDon- nell's case), the hand is well formed, but that the forearm is much shorter than it should be, being very little longer than the hand ; the whole length of the forearm is not eight inches, while that of the hand, measured in its greatest length, amounts to six inches and one half. The forearm in its upper part is round and muscular; as we examine it towards the hand, Fie. 928. Congenital dislocation of both Bones of the Forearm backwards. it assumes a well marked quadrilateral form, and we observe a projection on the dorsum of the carpus posteriorly, obviously formed by the lower extremities of the radius and ulna, which are dislocated backwards. The lower extremity of the forearm at the wrist here exhibits a very oblique termination, the ulna having passed, by fully an inch, the carpal ex- tremity of the radius. When we place the forearm on its palmar aspect, as on a table, and view the ulnar side of it, we notice that the ulna rides conspi- cuously on the back of the carpus, being above its level about an inch ; and at the1512 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). same time that the ulna has passed so far 929.). The radius at its lowest part, besides downwards on the back of the carpus as to being thus shorter than the ulna, is much less reach even to the upper extremity of the salient on the dorsum of the carpus, metacarpal bone of the little finger (see fig. The upper extremity of the carpus and the Fig. 929. Second view of the same deformity as Fig. 928. hand are placed, as lias been mentioned, an- teriorly to, and somewhat above, the lowest extremity of the radius and ulna, and conse- quently the measurement of the antero-pos- terior diameter of the wrist is much increased ; the whole forearm is somewhat bowed, pre- senting on its anterior aspect a concavity in the longitudinal direction. Near the wrist- joint the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris on the inner side, and of the flexor carpi ra- dialis on the outer, or radial side, are thrown into strong relief, and thus contribute to give the quadrilateral form to the wrist above alluded to, Since the writer made this communication to the Surgical Society of Dublin, he has seen other cases of congenital luxation at the wrist-joint of both the bones of the forearm backwards on the dorsum of the carpus. They so strongly resembled the cases just now adduced, that lie refrains from entering into particulars. From all these last men- tioned, the individuals practically suffered little from the defect. From the cases the writer has seen or in- vestigated, he may draw the following conclu- sions : — 1st. That the case of D. O'Neil, brought before the Pathological Society of Dublin, Dec. 15th, 1838, by the writer, was the first example laid before the profession with the intention of proving that such a lesion as a congenital luxation of the wrist-joint existed. 2nd. That Cruveilhier's case, adduced five years previously, as a case of an old unreduced luxation of the wrist-joint, and considered by Dupuytren as a fracture of the radius and dislocation of the ulna, and since misinter- preted by others, must hereafter be looked upon as an excellent example of congenital luxation of both the bones of the forearm backwards at the wrist-joint. 3rd. That the case sent to Dublin by Dr. MacDonnell of Montreal, is another exam- ple of a congenital luxation of the bones of the fore-arm at the wrist-joint backwards. 4th. In these three the humerus and hand seem to have borne, as to length and size, a normal proportion to the stature of the indi- viduals; but the forearms in all three were so much shortened, as not to exceed by one inch the measurement of the long axis of the hand. 5th. The lower extremity of the ulna in the three cases, instead of being on a level with the lower extremity of the radius, as it normally is, had passed lower down on the dorsum of the carpus from half an inch to one inch. Besides these three cases of congenital luxation of the bones of the forearm back- ward at the wrist-joint, Dr. R. Smith has, in his valuable work recently published, referred to two more specimens of the same malform- ation. A cast of one of these specimens was preserved in the Museum of the Bristol In- firmary, in August, 1836, when the writer and Dr. Smith visited that hospital, and the bones of the other specimen have been preserved in the Museum of the Richmond Hospital. The case of O'Neil presented in her left forearm the only example of which we have heard of congenital luxation of the bones of the forearm forwards (fig. 926.). In this case, also, it is to be remarked, that the forearm was pretermiturally short. Since the above observations were written I have seen other examples of congenital luxations of the wrist, in which the bones of the forearm were displaced backwards, and the carpus forwards, as in figs. 924. and 925. Sometimes the defect was single, or only af- fected one forearm ; in others, the defect, if the paradoxical language be allowed, was sym- metrical, affecting both wrists alike. A case of this last description was shown to me lately in the Downpatrick Infirmary, by the surgeon of the institution, Mr. Brabazon, who was kind enough to present me with a cast, which I have in my possession.* This healthy young woman is the mother of many well-formed children, and feels but little in- convenience from the malformation. When speaking of the congenital defects of the elbow-joint, we noticed that the up- per extremity of the radius often exceeded its normal length, so as to reach as high as the level of the olecranon process. (See Elbow, Abnormal Condition of.) We may^ here remark, that the ulna as the result of congenital malformation, in almost all the specimens we have examined, of the congenital * This cast so much resembles that of 929., that they couhl scarcely be supposed to have been taken from two different individuals.WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). J513 luxation of the wrist, has been at least half an inch lower down than the level of the carpal extremity of the radius. The reverse, however, of this I have lately seen, in a case of congenital luxation of the wrist, under Dr. M'Dowel's care, in the Whitworth Hos- pital. In this case, of which Dr. Gordon has been kind enough to present me with a cast, the radius has, at its lower extremity, passed half an inch lower down on the back of the carpus than the ulna; varieties have been also noticed as to the carpus; in some cases the bones of the carpus were not only malformed, but deficient in number ; in one case nine bones were found. There are other congenital malformations of the wrist-joint which demand some attention from the physician and surgeon, such as affections of the wrist analogous to valgus, and cases of the foot and ankle, but we do not consider this the place to discuss these cases. We may make the same remark as to those congenital defects of the hand witli deformity of the wrist, which have been noticed to co- incide with a deficiency in the brain on the side opposite to the deformity. Accident.—The principal lesions which the structure that compose the region of the wrist are liable to, are : — 1st. Dislocations of the wrist and neigh- bouring radio-ulnar articulations. 2nd. Dislocations of the bones of the carpus. 3rd. Fractures of the lower extremities of the bones of the forearm, in the immediate vicinity of the wrist-joint. 1st. Dislocations. — Dislocations and frac- tures of the bones entering into the com- position of the wrist-joint are two kinds of lesions, which for a long time have been confounded together, or mistaken for each other. Even in modern times authors have stated the wrist-joint to be liable to numerous luxations. Tims, Boyer, Petit, Mr. Samuel Cooper, &c. &c, entered into a de- scription of the different dislocations of the wrist, as forwards, backwards, inwards, and outwards, complete and incomplete, just as Hippocrates and others, down to Celsus, had done. Nevertheless, some moderns, at the head of whom we would place Dr. Colles of Dublin, Dupuytren, and Sir Benjamin Brodie, main- tained that luxations of the wrist-joint from accident were either impossible, or, at all events, exceedingly rare, and expressed their opinion that authors had, under the erroneous name of dislocation, really described an accident now pretty generally believed to be a frac- ture of the radius in the immediate vicinity of the wrist-joint, with displacement back- wards of the carpus and hand. Velpeau followed these, and not only de- nied the reality of such an accident as simple dislocation of the wrist, but gave his reasons why he believed that no such accident could occur, observing, that the strong tendons of the flexor muscles of the forearm, bound down by the anterior annular ligament of the carpus, must render impossible any luxation of the bones of the forearm forwards at the wrist-joint, during any forcible bending back- wards of the hand, such as might, for example, be produced by a fall on the palm ; and, 2nd!y, that the common and radial extensor (re- strained as they arc by the posterior annular ligament), oppose any luxation of the bones of the forearm backwards at the wrist during a movement which should produce an extreme flexion of the hand forwards. Velpeau, however, admitted, that from ex- periments he had made on the dead subject, he had learned that efforts of a different order, such as a forcible pulling, accompanied with a simultaneous bending of the hand, whether backwards or forwards, inwards or outwards, might break every tissue, and produce a lux- ation without any fracture of the radius. Such cases, he says, he believes will always be ac- companied with a wound of the integuments, and are not to be looked upon as the simple dislocations we are now considering, nor should they, in his opinion, enter into the same category with them. In support of the doctrine, that most, if not all, of the simple dislocations of the wrist, of the authors already alluded to, were really fractures of the lower extremity of the radius, we confess that one observation of Velpeau appears particularly strong, viz., that for the last thirty or forty years in which the question has been discussed, and the reality of the luxation disputed, no one has brought forward one instance which, rigidly examined, he would look upon as an incontestable exam- ple of a simple luxation of the wrist-joint. He admits that the solitary case adduced by Voillemier is a very notable one, and de- serving of attention, but that in his opinion, the question is still open as to whether a sim- ple luxation of the wrist-joint can occur, without there being at the same time any lesion of the edges of the articular surfaces, or of the integuments. We think we cannot do better than here give an abstract of this remarkable case, given by Voillemier.* " Levillain Louis, set. 27, of a vigorous con- stitution, on the 28th Sept. 1839, was ad- mitted under the care of M. le Noris, into the Hopital des Cliniques (Paris) ; at the moment of admission he was in a hopeless state, completely insensible ; the pupils largely dilated, the respiration stertorous. Amongst other lesions from which the patient had suf- fered, in consequence of his having fallen into a court-yard from a window three stories high, to the ground, it was noticed specially that the left wrist-joint -presented a very remarkable deformity, and of such a nature that Voille- mier, prejudiced as he said he felt he was, that a luxation of the wrist was a great rarity, if not an impossibility, could not help saying to his colleague, M. Dumeiil, present at the examination of the patient, that the case be- * See Archives Ge'ne'rales do Medecine, Deeemb. 1839, p. 400.1514 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). fore them was one of dislocation of the wrist. Four hours after the admission of the patient into hospital he died. " The forearm was semi-flexed as well as the hand. The bony plane represented by the metacarpus and the carpus was almost parallel to that of the forearm. The hand was neither adducted nor abduced, hut had suffered a dis- placement "de totalite" towards the internal side. At the posterior and inferior part of the forearm there was a saliency formed by the displaced carpus. A line drawn from the summit of this saliency to the phalangeal ex- tremity of the metacarpal bone to the middle finger, measured three inches and seven lines, the same length which the uninjured carpus and metacarpus of the opposite side presented. At the inferior and anterior part of the forearm a, there existed a transverse eminence, situ- ated about eight lines nearer to the extreme point of the fingers, than the posterior sali- ency B, while it projected anteriorly beyond the plane of the palmar surface of the hand, fully seven lines. The radii on both sides measured alike. The skin was abraded, and a wound about an inch long existed on the dorsal surface of the radius near the wrist, at about the level of the superior border of the pronator quadratus. Ligaments.— The external lateral ligament and the posterior ligament were lacerated ; the anterior completely torn from the border of the radius. Some remnants of this struc- ture lay on the front of the carpus. The in- ternal lateral ligament was not torn, but the styloid process of the ulna, maintained by this ligament, and at the same time by the attach- ment of the sheath of the flexor carpi ulnaris, had been detached from the body of the bone. Thus all the means of union of the articu- lations had been completely severed, and the bones of the forearm were only held to the carpus by some bundles of fibres, which passed posteriorly from the triangular ligament to the internal side of the carpus. Bones. — The radius did not present any trace of fracture; the body of the ulna was also unbroken, hut its styloid process was torn from the rest of the bone, although still held by ligament and tendon, as above men- tioned. In the new position which the bones of the forearm had accidentally assumed, re- latively to the carpus, they concealed ami lay in front of the whole first range of carpal bones, and had been arrested in their descent only by the true annular ligament, and the tendons of those flexor muscles which pass behind this ligament."* Let us suppose now a transverse fracture of the radius, situated near to the wrist-joint, with the displacement backwards of the in- ferior fragment. This kind of accident will most simulate a luxation of the wrist, such as the foregoing case, in consequence of the size of the two eminences, the one placed anteriorly, the other posteriori}' ; but in frac- * Archives Geneiales de Me'decine, Decemb. 1839, p. 401. ture the anterior and posterior saliency, in general, are not very conspicuous ; while in luxation the posterior formed by the carpus, and the anterior by the bones of the forearm, have each a thickness of more than half an inc h. It is very true that we have seen cases (see fig. 933., for example) of fractures through the junction of the lower epiphyses of the radius, with fracture also of the ulna, which even in this amount of saliency of the anterior and posterior prominency, much resembled the ease of a dislocation ; but the saliency pos- teriorly in the case of the dislocation is formed only by the rounded summit of the carpus, and the measurement from this point to the ulti- mate extremity of the middle finger gives only the normal length of the hand; whereas, if the deformity at the back of the forearm resulted from a fracture of the radius with displacement backwards of the lower frag- ment surmounting the carpus, a measurement taken from the summit of the dorsal pro- minence to the end of the middle finger would show an increase of at least half an inch over the normal length of the whole hand, because to the summit of the carpus in the case of fracture with displacement is superadded the amount of the depth of the lower fragment of the radius. By this test of measurement, therefore, we might settle our diagnosis be- tween these two accidents which so much resemble each other. The styloid process, too, of the radius can be felt still holding its normal relation to the carpus in cases of fracture, and to move with the hand when any motion is communi- cated to it ; whereas, in the rare dislocation of the wrist-joint, which we are here consi- dering, the lower extremity of the radius and ulna will be found placed in front of the carpus, and here, too, form an abrupt swell- ing, just above the superior margin of the annular ligament of the wrist. Dislocation of the bones of the forearm back- ivards with displacement forwards of the carpus. — It is said that this dislocation, which is the reverse of the foregoing case of Voillemier, may occur as the result of accident.* Upon this head all we have to say is, that this dis- location of the bones of the forearm back- wards at the wrist-joint, as the result of acci- dent, must be exceedingly rare ; but that, on the other hand, this is the very displacement of the bones which so usually exists in almost all cases of congenital dislocation of the wrist- joint (figs. 924-. and 925.). Luxations of the lower extremity of the ulna. — There are two species of this luxation of the lower extremity of the ulna. In one, the ulna escapes from the sigmoid cavity of the radius in passing backwards ; in the other, it is by the anterior part of the articulation that the displacement occurs. Luxation of the inferior extremity of the ulna backwards is the more frequent of the two ; that forwards must be rare, says Boyer, for I have seen but one * See Nelaton, Ele'mens de Pathologie, vol. ii. p. 408.WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1515 example of it, and Dupuytren mentions that he has met with but two. Sir A. Cooper refers to only one case of dislocation of the lower extremity of the ulna. In this case the bone was thrown backwards. Luxation of the lower extremity of the ulna at the wrist-joint, backwards. — Desault has published the history of a washerwoman who had a luxation of the inferior extremity of the ulna backwards, in consequence of the violent and sudden pronation in which the wrist had been forced into while she was in the act of wringing clothes. In this luxation, backwards, the forearm and hand are in a state of forced pronation, and the two bones are strongly crossed, forming with each other a very acute angle of decus- sation ; the inferior part of the forearm is much narrower than in the normal state ; the forearm, the hand, and the fingers, are main- tained in a state of moderate flexion, but iixed ; the tendons of the flexor muscles of the finger are, as it were, matted together into a single fasciculus, displaced inwards, and form a sensible saliency upon the ulnar border of the radius. What strikes one most, in looking at the back part of the wrist, is the very manifest projection on the dorsum of the region, formed by the lower extremity of the ulna, which rises so much above the level of the back of the hand. Luxation forwards. — Desault, Boyer, and Dupuytren have each adverted to this dislo- cation, in which we observe an oblique cross- ing of the bones of the forearm ; the fingers are semiflexed, and there is a remarkable narrowness of the inferior part of the limb. The forearm and hand are fixed into a state of supination, the saliency of the ulna is per- ceived in front, the tendons of the flexor muscles are pushed outwards towards the radius, and the inferior part of the ulna, instead of being parallel to that of the radius, as in the normal state, is oblique from above downwards, from within outwards, and from behind forwards. .Boyer gives the following remarkable ex- ample of this accident. In 1791, a woman of a strong constitution, and of a spare, though muscular frame, while in a state of intoxica- tion, looking at two persons playing "domino" in a cafe, in Paris, foolishly ventured some advice to the players, who besought her not to interrupt them. She, however, thought proper to persist in giving her gratuitous advice, until at last one of the players, a strong and vigorous man, got up in a very angry mood, seized her violently by the right hand ami endeavoured to push her out of the room. In this movement her hand and fore- arm were carried suddenly into a state of preternatural supination. Immediately the woman experienced the most acute pain, and cried out that her wrist was broken. The pain, the deformity, and the impossi- bility she experienced of executing the or- dinary movements of the forearm, made her fear that she was most seriously injured* " I was called in," says Boyer, " instantly, and I found the patient complaining of most acute suffering, having the forearm flexed, the hand fixed in a forced state of supination. The least effort to communicate a movement of pronation caused the patient the most acute aggravation of her sufferings. The ulna formed a very sensible prominence anteriorly, and this bone, instead of being parallel to the radius, formed with it an acute angle, crossing its direction somewhat, and passing down- wards, forwards, and outwards." All these symptoms taken together left no doubt on the mind of Boyer, but that the case he had to deal with was one of luxation forwards of the lower extremity of the ulna. It was not until after having tried thrice unsuccessfully that at length he succeeded in reducing the dislocation. Luxations of the inferior extremity of the ulna forwards from the scaphoid cavity of the radius are, according to the opinion also of Dupuytren, excessively rare, at least, " in the course of my long practice," he says, " I have met with but two cases of this accident." One of these cases he gives us a detail of, as follows:— Case. M. Blot, an officer of the gendarmerie, aet. 32, of a sanguine tempera- ment and athletic constitution; while on duty during the night, the horse upon which he was mounted took fright, reared up, and fell back with his rider. The latter was happy enough during the fall to disengage himself nearly from the animal, with the exception that his right arm was placed between the head of the horse and the ground, and thus received a violent shock. M. Blot, considering his fore- arm broken, applied to two surgeons, who, each in succession, recognised a dislocation of the ulna at the wrist, and each, also, failed in reducing the dislocation. M. Blot came to Paris, suffering much, and applied at the Hotel Dieu to Dupuytren, on 25th November. He then laboured under the following symp- toms : — The forearm was much swollen ; the hand was in a median position between pro- nation and supination- the inferior part of the forearm was deformed, rounded or rendered cylindrical near the wrist-joint by the diminu- tion of its bilateral diameter—a remarkable saliency existed within and in front, formed by the lower extremity of the ulna thrown forwards towards the palmar aspect—behind, a remarkable depression replaced the ac- customed prominency formed by the lower extremity of the ulna (la malleole interne) ; indeed, behind, a depression existed instead of the saliency ordinarily formed by the head of the ulna. If we followed with the fin- gers the ulna, from the elbow even to the hand, we perceived that this bone directed itself obliquely forwards and outwards in crossing and passing over the inferior part of the radius. The luxation of the radius forwards became then evident. There was no crepitation. The movements of pronation and supination were completely lost. Du-WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1516 puytren having failed at the first attempt, he succeeded in reducing the luxation by inclin- ing the hand forcibly to the radial side, and pushing with his two thumbs, united the dis- placed extremity of the ulna inwards and backwards. By this process the reduction was affected. The patient cried out at once, " I am well." All deformity had disappeared, and the motion of pronation and supination were restored. (Gazette Medical, Malgaigne.) Such cases as these, says Dupuytren, ought to be recorded by every surgeon when he meets with them, in consequence of their rarity and importance. Luxation of the bones of the carpus. — The bones of the carpus are united to each other so solidly, and their movements are so limited, that without experience, we should be dis- posed to pronounce luxation of any of these bones impossible. Nevertheless, the head of the os magnum may be dislocated from the cavity formed for it by the scaphoid and semi- lunar bones. The first range of the bones of the carpus is articulated with the bones of the second range in such a manner that slight gliding movements of flexion and extension of the hand are permitted, which augment a little the movements of flexion aud extension of the hand upon the forearm, and add some- what, as Cruveilhier says, to the grace of the movements of this portion of the upper ex- tremity. In flexion, the head of the os mag- num, which is somewhat inclined backwards, raises up the thin capsule which surrounds its articulation, and if this movement be carried very far, the capsule and accessory fibres which support the bone posteriorly are broken, and the os magnum escapes from the cavity in which it is naturally placed ; the dis- location cannot be called complete, yet the os magnum passes somewhat the level of the posterior surface of the other bones of the carpus. The accident is more common in women than in men, no doubt because the ligaments are weaker and the bones enjoy greater motion in the former, than in the latter. The luxation backwards of the os magnum, the only one which can occur, is always the result of a forced and violent flexion of the wrist, such, for example, as a fall on the back of the hand would produce. We recognise the lux- ation of the os magnum by the history of the accident, and by the deformity produced. We perceive a hard, circumscribed tumour, which has suddenly appeared on the back of the hand, in the situation which corresponds to the head of the bone. This tumour becomes more prominent when the hand is flexed, and diminishes when it is extended : we can make it disappear entirely by a slight compression. This luxation causes but little inconvenience ; but the head of the os magnum always remains more salient when the hand is flexed, and forms a tumour, more or less marked, accord- ing to the extent of the displacement. We can easily reduce this luxation by ex- tending the hand, or by exercising a slight pressure on the head of the os magnum ; but, although it is easy to make the bone resume its position in the cavity formed for it by the scaphoid and semi-lunar bones, it is very dif- ficult to maintain it there, and the incon- venience and deformity resulting from the luxation are so trivial, that few persons will submit with patience to the means usually recommended. Fractures of the lower extremity of the radius in the immediate vicinity of the wrist-joint.— We believe that the first important effort to direct attention to the peculiarities which the fracture of the lower extremity of the radius presents, was made by the late professor of surgery, of the College of Surgeons, in Dublin, Dr. A. Colles, in the year 1814.* Subse- quently, we find Sir A. Cooper, in London, and Dupuytren, in Paris, each pointing out the importance, in a practical point of view, of our studying this accident, and distin- guishing the case of fracture of the radius with displacement backwards of the carpus, from true dislocation backwards of the hand at the wrist-joint. Velpeau followed these, concurring with them in the opinion that a transverse frac- ture of the lower extremity of the radius was a very common injury, and frequently mistaken for a dislocation. He seemed to be even more positive than his predecessors in maintaining the doctrine that no accidental luxation of the wrist-joint could occur with- out a fracture of some of the bony processes, or laceration of the integuments. This fracture is rarely attributable to any direct cause; it appears, however, that Hub- lier communicated to the Academy of Medi- cine the case of a young girl, who having had the wrist caught between the pole of a car- riage and a wall, had gotten a transverse frac- ture of the lower extremity of the radius. In this case there was combined with the above mentioned transverse fracture, another vertical one at right angles with it, dividing into two the lower fragment, constituting what in other articulations we have elsewhere in this book (vide Knee, Elbow) denominated a T fracture. This species of fracture by direct violence, corresponds much to the cases de- scribed by Dupuytren as " Fracture par ecrase- ment." Fractures of the radius may be caused by falls on the back of the hand, but by far the most frequent sources of the fracture in question are falls on the palm. Malgaigne asks, by what mechanism are these fractures of the lower extremity of the radius specially produced. In reply he ad- duces the following experiment by Nelaton : — The latter amputated the forearm of a dead body at the elbow, and cut off the olecranon at a level with the head of the radius. He then applied the palm of the hand of the sub- ject on a solid plane, the forearm being at the same time directed vertically; he now with a mallet struck a heavy blow directly on the superior extremity of the two bones of * Vide Edinb. Med. and Surgical Journal, vol. x. 1814.1517 Will ST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy), the forearm. The wrist broke and became immediately deformed. The dissection re- vealed a simple and transverse fracture of the carpal extremity of the radius, with a dis- placement backwards of the lower fragment, as with ordinary cases of fracture of the radius in the immediate vicinity of the wrist- joint, a species of injury, which in this city is known by the name of" Colles' fracture." It would also appear to Malgaigne, Bouchct, and Voillemier, that this fracture may be the result of a sudden and violent flexion of the hand without the patient having had any fall. This fact was first established by Bouehet, who, in endeavouring to produce dislocation of the wrist on the dead body, only caused in his experiments fractures of the inferior ex- tremity of the radius ; sometimes with other disorders, and more particularly with a simul- taneous fracture of the styloid process of the ulna. Symptoms. — If Colles' fracture of the radius be produced by a fall, the patient will, sometimes, be able to say that at the moment of the accident he felt a sensation of some- thing having given way near to the wrist-joint. The inferior extremity of the forearm and the hand swell ; the fingers are semi-flexed, and the patient experiences the greatest diffi- culty in performing the ordinary movements of the hand, or forearm. He usually pre- sents himself to us with the hand of the injured forearm resting on its ulnar margin, and supported by the other hand, and in a middle state between pronation and supina- tion. The posterior surface of the forearm usually represents a considerable deformity; for a depression is seen to exist about one inch above the line of the wrist-joint, whilst a con- siderable swelling occupies the wrist itself and metacarpus ; indeed, the carpus and base of the metacarpus, appear to be thrown back- wards so much, as at first view to excite a suspicion that the radius had been dislocated forwards, and the carpus and hand back- Fig. 930. " Colles' Fractur wards (Jig. 930.). On viewing the anterior sur- face of the limb we observe a considerable fulness, as if caused by the flexor tendons being thrown forwards ; this fulness extends upwards, to about one-third of the length of the forearm, anil terminates below at the upper edge of the annular ligament of the wrist. The inferior fragment of the radius being salient posteriorly, while the superior is thrown forwards, the injured forearm, viewed side-ways, resembles, in the undulating direc- tion of its long axis, the outline, according to Velpeau's idea, of a silver dinner-fork. Besides presenting this very striking de- formity, in this fracture we find the hand oc- casionally thrown outwards, or towards the radial side, and then the carpal extremity of the ulna presents a strong saliency internally. The degree, however, in which this projec- tion towards the inner edge of the wrist takes place, will be found to vary. The patient is unwilling to attempt to pro- nate or supinate his hand, and if we endea- vour to communicate such movements, much pain is produced. There is considerable pain felt by the patient when we press firmly with the point of the finger in the exact situation of the fracture. The internal lateral ligament of the wrist- joint is generally put upon the stretch, and the patient usually complains of much distress here ; but this pain, which some patients feel about the lower extremity of the ulna, does not always arise simply from a sprain coin- cident with the fracture or from a rupture of the internal lateral ligament of the articula- tion of the carpus with the forearm, but we believe sometimes is owing to a fracture of the root of the styloid process of the ulna. It is in this last case more particularly that the hand "par un mouvement de totalite," is carried outwards, and that the ulna seems very salient, internally (fig- 931.). A narrowing of the region of the wrist, in the transverse direction, has been much ad- verted to by Dupuytren, as a S3'mptom of the fracture we are now considering, but we believe this narrowing is, in general, more ap- parent than real. We rather concur with Velpeau, who says, " Many observations have induced me to believe that Dupuytren, and others, have been deceived as to the supposed narrowing of the wrist." He adds, an in- terosseous space, in reality, does not exist near to the wrist joint; indeed, there is scarcely any open interval to be seen between the lower extremity of the radius and ulna for the space of one inch above the line of the radio- carpal articulation. Now, fractures ordinarilyWRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1518 take place at a point which is below the level Cooper, who asserts that in this fracture a of this line, and any displacement, the result very powerful extension is required to bring of fracture, cannot readily affect the breadth the broken ends of the radius into apposition. ° of the interosseous space, placed above the line of the fracture. Fig. 932. Fig. 931. It is only in cases where the fracture is situated so high as an inch and a half, or more, above the joint, that any abnormal ap- proximation of the bones towards each other, and ultimate obliteration of the interosseous interval is to be dreaded. Although therefore, as a result of Colles' fracture, we observe the forearm assume, near the wrist-joint, a cylindroidal form, there may be no real narrowing whatever, but the ap- pearance of it may be attributed rather to an increase, in the antero-posterior diameter of the region of the wrist, than to any real diminution which occurs transversely. Malgaigne has, however, adduced an example to explain how, in certain rare cases, a diminu- tion of the transverse diameter of the forearm may occasionally take place, and by the action of the pronator quadratus not on the inferior, but on the upper fragment of the radius. (Jig. 032.) It is said by some, that crepitation, caused by the movements of the fragments of the broken radius on each other, can always be elicited, and that this sign is diagnostic of fracture; moreover, that the deformity is easy to reduce by extension, but liable to return when the extending force is removed. Such observations, no doubt, may sometimes be made with truth. For our own parts, we do not think that crepitation can, except in a very few cases, be elicited in Colles' fracture of the radius. We have found it to be an injury attendeil with a deformity which can, it is true, be removed by extension, but our experience corresponds wilh that of Sir A. After Mahjaigne. Diagnosis.— In man}' cases, a fracture of the radius in the immediate vicinity of the wrist- joint is attended with so much deformity, and accompanied with such characteristic appear- ances, that the observation of Pouteau appears well founded, that it can be recognised at the first " coup d'oeil;" but on the other hand, there are some cases in which very little ex- ternal evidence of any fracture can, without careful examination, be detected. The un- dulating curve, which has been compared to that represented by a silver fork, cannot exist without fracture, and the elevation from the level of the back part of the radius of the common extensor tendons is another feature, which we believe with Velpeau to be peculiar to fracture; we know that in the normal state the tendons of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior remain applied as longi- tudinal bands, lying flat on the posterior surface of the radius, and no interval whatever exists between these two bands and the back part of this bone near to the wrist. Now, when there is a fracture of the radius here, this bone is rendered somewhat concave on its posterior surface, and these tendons must, of necessity, abandon the bony surface, and be raised up several lines from it, so as to repre- sent a cord, more or less tense, but easy to depress. If, for example, the hand of the patient being a little flexed, the surgeon in examining these cases, places his finger or thumb three or four lines above the level of the wrist-joint, on the posterior surface, and near to the external border of the radius, he will, if fracture exist, recognise beneath theWRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy 1519 skin the tense cord, and perceive that it can he depressed even to the posterior surface of the radius, from which it had been manifestly elevated. This last is a test upon which Velpeau specially relies. Upon the subject of Diagnosis of this fracture of the carpal end of the radius, Dr. Colles remarks, — " the facility with which the surgeon can move the ulna backwards and forwards, does not furnish him with any useful help in his diagnosis as to the true notion of the injury. Moreover, when he moves his fingers along the anterior surface of the radius, he finds it more full and prominent than is natural ; a similar examination of the posterior surface of this bone, induces him to think that a depression exists about an inch and one half above its carpal extremity. He now may expect to find satisfactory proofs of a fracture of the radius at this spot. For this purpose he attempts to move the broken pieces of the bone in opposite directions, but, the patient is by this examination subjected to considerable pain, yet neither crepitus, nor a yielding of the bone at the seat of fracture, nor any other positive evidence of the ex- istence of such an injury is thereby obtained. At last," adds Dr. Colles, " after many un- successful trials, I hit upon the following simple method of examination, by which I was enabled to ascertain that the symptoms above enumerated actually arose from a frac- ture of the lower extremity of the radius • — let the surgeon apply the fingers of one hand to the seat of the suspected fracture, and locking the other hand in that of the patient, make a moderate extension, until he observes the limb restored to its natural form. As soon as this is affected, let him move the patient's hand backward and forward, and he will, at every such attempt, be sensible to a yielding of the fractured end of the bone, and this to such a degree as to remove all doubt from his mind." I have already stated that sometimes the fracture may exist without being accompanied by any appreciable displacement of the bones. The patient complains of a severe pain in the region of the wrist, when pressure is made on the broken part, and also when the fore- arm is moved. These are the only symptoms which exist, (if we except a slight swelling, particularly observable on the anterior surface of the wrist,) so that one -would be tempted to believe that there was only a simple sprain existing. If, however, we make pressure on the line of the articulation, we do not cause the patient any pain, which we should do, if the symptoms arose from a sprain, while if the same degree of pressure be made a few lines above the joint, the pain is very severely felt. Now, if we place a thumb on the radius behind, in the presumed seat of fracture, and make the effort to bend the wrist at this part, so as it were to make the forearm here form an angle on itself, salient anteriorly ; if the angle be thus formed, we hereby obtain a pathognomonic sign of the fracture ; and a comparison of the two wrists submitted equally to this experiment, puts the matter beyond all doubt.* Fractures of the lower extremity of the radius are generally looked upon as serious injuries. If this fracture has been mistaken for a sprain, or luxation, or abandoned to nature, according to Dupuytren, very serious changes ensue. " The forearm, in the region of the wrist, instead of presenting a surface flattened anteriorly, will assume a cj'lindroidal form. The movement of pronation and supination will be lost, an eedematous swell- ing of the soft parts will continue ; the arti- culation remains immovable for a consi- derable time, and, if a rupture of the lateral ligament of the inferior radio-cubital articula- tion, or fracture of the styloid process of the ulna be superadded to the fracture of the lower extremity of the radius, we may see continue for life the abnormal mobility of the two bones on each other." Mr. Diday, of Paris, has gone further, and asserted that these consequences of fracture of the radius, above alluded to, are often observed, in spite of all kinds of treatment, and of bandages, which modern surgery has suggested. In making an estimate, as to the amount of evil resulting from the fracture of the lower extremity of the radius and its usual con- sequences, we find authors differ. Velpeau would seem to attribute many of the evils alluded to by Dupuytren rather to improper bandages, and the manner of treating the injury, than to anything in the nature of the accident itself. Although written so many years ago, the opinion of Dr. Colles, as to the prognosis in these cases, seems to us nearer the truth than any of the above mentioned conflicting ob- servations of the authors alluded to. Dr. Colles remarks, " that should the case be treated as a case of sprain, and the fracture left unreduced, the practitioner will find, after a lapse of time, sufficient for removing similar swellings, that the deformity is undiminished. By such mistakes the patient is doomed to en- dure for many months considerable stiffness, and lameness of the limb, accompanied by severe pains, in attempting to bend the hand anil fingers ; one consolation only remains, the limb will, at some future period, again enjoy perfect freedom in all its motions, and be completely exempt from pain, the deformity will, however, remain undiminished through life." Upon the whole, then, we may safely say, that when the fracture we have been describing has nothing unusual in it, and is only accom- panied with the ordinary displacement back- wards of the inferior fragment, that the case generally proceeds favourably. If the true nature of the accident has been early recognised, and proper and sufficient extension made of the forearm, the peculiar characteristic curve disappears, not to return; the fingers are found to be much more free in their movements, and can be more fully * Sec Colics and Malgaigne.1520 WRIST-JOINT (A BNORMAL ANATOMV). extended than before; the pain disappears, and in about a month after the fracture has occured, if judicious treatment be adopted, the union of the fragments is so perfect, that the passive motion to restore the joints to their primitive suppleness may be commenced. Notwithstanding, therefore, the opinions of Dupuytren, Diday, &t\, &c, we think that, as a general rule, in the case of Colles' fracture the prognosis is favourable. It ma)' be otherwise, if the styloid process of the radius be elevated much above its natural level, if the hand has quitted, par- tially, the lower end of the ulna, so as to be carried " par un mouvement de totalite " outwards, and if the case has not been early recognised. Anatomical characters of the Fracture — On dissection, it will be found that the hard swelling which occupies the back part of the hand and wrist, is caused by the displacement backwards of the lower fragment of the radius, and the carpus carried with it in this direction. As a consequence of the altered direction of the radius, we find that the aspect of the carpal articular surface of this bone is altered, and instead of being directed, as it normally is *, downwards and somewhat forwards, it is now directed downwards and backwards {fig. 933.) ; the carpus and metacarpus retaining Fie. 933. their connexion with the broken radius must always thus follow this bone in its derange- ments, and cause the characteristic dorsal convexity above alluded to. The change of direction of the articular surface of the radius is well shown by measuring the length of the broken radius in these cases, both on the palmar and dorsal aspect of this bone longi- tudinally, when it will be found that in Colics' fracture, the posterior measurement is several lines less than the anterior, which is exactly the reverse of what this measurement normally should be. We dwell upon this abnormal ob'iquity of the lower articular surface of the radius, for in the treatment of this injury it should be our principal aim to remedy this obliquity, and, as it were, reverse it, and thus make the aspect of the articular surface look as it should normally do, downwards and forwards. The change of direction of the articular surface is caused by the extensor muscles of the carpus, and of the thumb, and by their tendons, which pass along the posterior surface of the radius in sheaths, firmly con- nected with the inferior extremity of this bone, to which deviation in the direction of the lower fragment the action of the supinator longus muscle and its tendons may also some- what contribute. Professor Smith, who has investigated labo- riously the anatomy of the bones in this injury, says he has discovered nothing to invalidate the truth of the general proposition first main- tained by Voillemier, namely, that when the radius is broken within an inch of its lower extremity, the direction of the fracture is usually transverse; but we find that he differs entirely from this last-named author upon the doctrine of the fracture of the radius in ques- tion, being one by impaction. It is very true, he says, that in every instance of the ordinary fracture of the carpal extremity of the ratlins, which he had an opportunity of examining anatomically long after the occurrence of the injury, he found upon making a section of the bone, from before backwards, a line of com- pact tissue continuous with the posterior wall of the shaft, extending to a greater or less dis- tance into the reticular texture of the lower fragment; but he cannot agree with YToillemier, that this appearance affords evidence of im- paction of the upper fragment into the lower. In the only recent specimen Mr. Smith had an opportunity of examining, the lower fragment was displaced backwards, the superior pro- jecting one-eighth of an inch in front of it. There was no impaction whatever in this re- cent specimen, of either fragment into the other, nor any line of compact structure pene- trating the reticular tissue of the lower frag- ment. If the doctrine of impaction were true, the shortening of the radius in cases of fracture of its lower extremity, should be much greater than it ever is, for there is a second cause of shortening in operation, i. e. the alteration in the direction of the articulating surface, in consequence of which the posterior surface of the radius (naturally longer than the anterior) becomes the shorter of the two. Now, if to the degree of shortening produced by this cause we add that arising from impaction, we should have an amount of shortening much greater than ever occurs in the case of Colles' fracture ; indeed, alter adducing other argu- ments against the theory of Voillemier, as to this being a case of fracture by "penetration" Mr. Smith further remarks, that as long as the ulna remains unbroken and the ligamentous connexion between the two bones uninjured, it is scarcely possible for either fragment to * We always take it as understood that the patient is iu the erect posture.WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1521 penetrate the other, even to the extent of half an inch. We agree with Velpeau, Smith, &c., in thinking that in this injury, Colics' fracture, there is scarcely any diminution of the trans- verse diameter of the forearm. The cylin- droidal form which the arm acquires being owing partly to an effusion among the flexor tendons, but principally to the increase of the antero-posterior diameter of the forearm at the seat of the fracture, consequent on the back- ward displacement of the lower fragment. I have never seen the case, spoken of by many, of transverse fracture of the radius, with displacement forwards of the hand and lower fragment, which accident is said to be pro- duced by a fall on the back of the hand. Fracture of the lower extremity of the Ulna. — A fracture of the lower extremity of the ulna is rather a rare accident, because, per- haps, of the great elasticity of this long and slender bone, and the mobility of its lower end, by which it, as it were, eludes the force which might otherwise cause its fracture. In- deed the ulna, it will be recollected, is not directly connected with the hand as the radius, the " manubrium manus," is: and hence, when a patient falls on the palm of the hand, the whole force of the weight and im- pulse are sustained by the radius; but if this last bone gives way, and a transverse fracture occurs, with displacement backwards of the hand and lower fragment, then, as a secondary consequence, a fracture of the ulna, near the wrist-joint, may follow. In the vast majority of cases, however, of fracture of the radius close to the wrist, which occur, for example, in Codes' fracture, the ulna remains unbroken. Fracture of the lower extremity of the ulna may also be the effect of direct violence. When the ulna is broken alone, without being accompanied by any simultaneous frac- ture of the radius, it may be recognised by the pain felt by the patient when direct pressure is made on the broken part of the ulna, and by the difficulty he experiences whenever he attempts to pronate or supinate the forearm. When the surgeon takes hold of the lower fragment of the ulna, and moves it backwards and forwards, crepitation can be felt. Fracture of the lower extremity of the ulna is an accident which requires much attention from the surgeon, as sometimes, if the sepa- rated fragment be small, as, for example, con- sisting merely of the styloid process of the ulna, no union may occur, and permanent weakness of the wrist-joint may follow. Disjunction of the lower .Epiphysis of the Radius. — This must be considered rather a rare accident ; it is, however, occasionally to be met with; and the history of the art of surgery furnishes us with well-marked ex- amples of it, as the three following cases sufficiently prove: — Case 1. — "I have," says Cloquet, " ob- served one case of the disjunction of the lower epiphysis of the radius, in a young lad twelve years of age, who fell from a consi- derable height from a tree to the ground. VOL. IV. Besides the injury done to the radius, he received, at the time of the fall, a wound of the head which in three days proved fatal to him." Dissection. — The epiphysis of the right radius was entirely separated, and a great quantity of blood was effused in the deeper palmar region, behind the tendons of the deep flexor muscles of the fingers (Diction, de Medecine, 1824). Case 2. — Rognetta has adduced a similar case of a lad at fifteen years (Gazette Medi- cate, 1834-.). Case 3.— In December 15th, 1838, the writer laid a case before the Pathological Society of Dublin, which was a true speci- men of a disjunction of the lower epiphysis of the radius. The patient, having been above eighteen years of age, had attained to a more mature time of life than any other example of this special injury affecting the wrist hitherto recorded ; a representation of the external appearance which the lower part of the fore- arm and carpus presented in this case have been preserved by a plaster cast; and after the death of the patient, the actual condition of the parts having been ascertained anato- mically, these circumstances, in the writer's opinion, make this case valuable. A. R., let. eighteen, a mason, fell from a scaf- fold which was attached to the front of a lofty house at its third story. By the fall he re- ceived a severe injury of the head, which rendered him immediately insensible, and in this condition was admitted into the Richmond Hospital. Besides the injury of the head, we noticed in this case a remarkable lesion ; the right wrist had suffered a derangement, accom- panied with a deformity that at first sight we might suppose would be produced by a dislo- cation of the carpus and hand backwards on the dorsum of the forearm (Jig. 93 f.). The plane of the hand and carpus were placed fully three quarters of an inch behind the plane of the rest of the forearm ; and from the external appearances there seemed no doubt but that there was an abrupt transverse solution of continuity of the forearm, close to the wrist- joint, which equally affected both radius and ulna. On viewing the limb laterally, the peculiar curve which Velpeau compared to the back of a silver dinner fork, was exaggerated beyond what we noticed in the ordinary fracture of the radius in this situation; and the tendons of the extensors, particularly those of the extensor carpi, were thrown remarkably into relief. The anterior, or palmar surface of the fore- arm presented a longer and more uniform curve than the posterior ; the depth of the antero-posterior diameter of the wrist in the seat of injury was much increased : so that this and the bilateral measurement seemed equal. Thus the accident presented many of the appearances of the dislocation, backwards, of the hand and carpus; but the longitudinal measurement, taken from the highest part of 5 E1522 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). the dorsal prominence to the root of the in- inch over that of the opposite hand. This dex finger (from A to B fig. 934-.), on the in- excess of length was manifestly caused by jnred side, gave an excess of length of half an the presence of the disjoined epiphysis, -which Fig. 934. Disjunction of the Epiphysis of the Radius, with displacement backwards of the Hand and Carpus, — Author's Collection. had been superadded to the summit of the carpus, and was carried back with it, the wrist-joint itself remaining perfect. This simple test of the comparative measure- ment proved the case was not one of mere dislocation of the hand ; but we may also add, that, although there was considerable swelling and projection forwards of the palmar surface of the region of the wrist, there were not those hard protuberances to be felt in front of the carpus which the extremity of the radius and ulna, with their styloid processes, should have presented had the dislocation above alluded to occurred. The man died, in a few hours after admis- sion, from the injuries he received, particularly of the head. It had not been deemed advisable to reduce the fracture, as the man seemed to be in a dying state. Dissection. — With the assistance of my friend, Dr. Power (now Professor of Anatomy of the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin), I removed the greater part of the forearm, that we might the more carefully examine the true nature of the lesion, the external ap- pearances of which we have above described. On making, then, the anatomical examina- tion of the parts composing the region of the wrist in this case the radius was found to have suffered a transverse interruption of con- tinuity in the line of junction of its inferior epiphysis, and the lower fragment was dis- placed directly backwards, so far as nearly to have passed the extremity of the upper frag- ment (fig. 935.). The lower extremity of the ulna was broken a short distance above the line of junction with its epiphysis. This fracture was oblique. The extremities of the two frag- ments of the ulna formed with each other an angle salient in front. The ligaments ami the radio-carpal articulation also remained unin- jured, and the carpus (of course) accompanied the lower fragment of the radius in its dis- placement backwards. Case 4. — A boy, aet. eleven, was admitted into the Richmond Hospital on the 2nd of September, 1840, under the care of Dr. Mac- donnell. Upon the Sunday previous to his admission he had been thrown from a horse with great violence. The lower extremity of the left radius was broken, and he sustained a Disjunction of the Lower Epiphysis of the Radius, with fracture of the Ulna, and displacement back- wards of the Carpus and Hand. — Museum of the Richmond Hospital. concussion of the brain, under the influence of which he remained insensible for three quarters of an hour. The accident occurred at some distance from town. Before an hour elapsed the boy was visited by a surgeon, who, it is said, forcibly extended the limb, and then applied a narrow roller tightly round the wrist. On the following day (Monday) the patient1523 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 5 E 2 complained of intense pain in the limb; the hand became cold and discoloured; the roller was not removed nor relaxed. On Tuesday, dark coloured vesicles formed ; constitutional symptoms of the gangrene showed themselves; the pulse 159, feeble; countenance anxious. The gangrene increased for two days more, and reached within two inches of the elbow- joint. On the sixth day a line of separation showed itself; and on the twenty-fourth day the bones were sawn through, and the wound soon healed. Dissection of amputated Forearm. — The radius was found to have been completely broken through in the line of junction with its lower epiphysis. The ulna was entire. The preparation of the disjoined epiphysis and gangrened hand is preserved in the Museum of the Richmond Hospital. The causes which have been known to pro- duce a disjunction of the epiphysis are said to be similar to those which produce a transverse fracture of the bone close to the wrist-joint: but why in one case we should have a fracture, and in another a disjunction of the epiphysis, we cannot say. All my own observation has, as yet, taught me relative to this subject from the cases I have seen and inquired into, has been that the cause producing the disjunction in question has always been a violent one. When a patient has suffered a disjunction of the lower epiphysis of the radius, there is, in general, much deformity observable in the region of the wrist. The hand, carpus, and lower fragment are carried backwards, and form together a plane which is from half an inch to three quarters of an inch behind the plane of the back part of the rest of the fore- arm ; the transverse line of elevation of the lower fragment above the level of the dorsum of the upper fragment of the radius is very abrupt and obvious : and the first impression on the mind is, that a dislocation backwards of the carpus and hand is the accident which has occurred. This abrupt transverse ridge and depression are crossed vertically by the extensor tendons of the carpus; and pressure with the fingers discovers these longitudinal tendinous bands to be on the stretch, having been forcibly elevated from the back part of the radius as they pass to their grooves formed in the lower fragment. The palmar surface of the forearm is un- usually convex from above downwards, and does not present a salient angle in front, such as we might expect from the abrupt depression we noticed on the dorsum of the wrist and forearm. This convexity of the forearm in front, however, abruptly terminates in a trans- verse narrow sulcus which marks the situation of the upper margin of the anterior annular ligament. The radial margin of the forearm is concave, and the ulnar margin presents a cor- responding convexity. The patient complains much of pain, and has the same inability to move the forearm and hand as in cases of fracture. By the above-mentioned signs we become informed that a solution of continuity in or near to the transverse line of junction of the lower epiphysis of the radius exists : but without having had any opportunity of insti- tuting an anatomical examination, we believe it would be difficult for any one to affirm whether the case were one of fracture, or disjunction of the epiphysis. Some writers seem to think that the case of disjunction of the epiphysis may be recognised by the circumstance, that, although there is an evi- dent solution of continuity in the line of the radius, the crepitus of an ordinary fracture cannot be produced. To which we reply, that the absence of crepitation is not by any means unusual in cases of fracture of the ra- dius in the region of the wrist; and, therefore, from this observation no useful inference can be deduced to aid our diagnosis. In the examples of disjunction we have seen, we have always noticed a fixed condi- tion, as it were, from the interlocking with each other of the portions of the disjoined radius ; so that it seemed quite vain to seek for crepitus ; —indeed we found it invariably demanded a considerable force in these cases to restore the limb to its original form. We believe it is impossible to make a dif- ferential diagnosis entirely to be relied on in these cases ; but we may, we think, conjec- ture that the disjunction in question exists rather than a fracture, when the age of the patient is under eighteen or nineteen years, and the situation of the solution of con- tinuity is in the exact transverse line of the junction of the epiphysis to the shaft of the bone. If, however, the diagnosis be difficult, we have practically little to regret this cir- cumstance, because the prognosis and tlit- treatment will be the same in both cases. Section 111. Disease. — In describing the alterations, the result of disease as it af- fects the other articulations, the abnormal anatomy of which we have already adverted to in this work, we have classed these morbid changes into those which are the consequence, 1st. Of Acute Arthritis. 2nd. Of Strumous Arthritis ; that is to say, " a scrofulous disease of the joints, having its origin in the cancellous structure of the bones." 3rd. Of Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis. Here we may adopt a similar arrangement, but shall find it necessary to add,— 4thly. A few observations on Synovial Tu- mours of the Region of the Wrist. Acute Arthritis of the radio-carpal, and of the inter-carpal articulations, may be the con- sequence of a contusion or a wound, or it may originate in some internal cause, such as an acute rheumatic, or a diffuse inflammation. Acute arthritis oiany or all the joints which enter into the composhion of the region of the wrist may be the consequence of a sprain or wound, or the inflammatory action may have been communicated to these joints by having extended along an injured tendon of the fin- ger, or the inflammation, suddenly showing it- self in the joints, may have originated in some unknown internal causes,such as those whichWRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1524 preside over the development of an attack of an acute rheumatic arthritis, or of diffuse in- flammation. Whatever may have been the specific nature of the acute inflammation, there is soon no- ticed, besides the pain felt through the carpal region and the heat, that there is considerable swelling. This last is more particularly ob- served on the dorsum of the wrist and carpus than elsewhere. An effusion, whether of serum or pus, very soon takes place into the interior of the synovial sac, which will always have a tendency to distend this sac in all di- rections ; but there can appear but little swelling at the anterior part of the arti- culation, because here a large fasciculus of flexor tendons of the fingers passes, and supports the synovial membrane. On the lateral aspect of the wrist-joint, the tume- faction, although sensible, is still limited by the resistance which the lateral ligaments op- pose to the distension of the capsule. Behind, on the contrary, where the synovial membrane is unsupported and but superficially covered, the swelling, the result of the inflammation, soon becomes much more manifest, and fluc- tuation evident. We are not aware of any case recorded in which complete dislocation of the hand, on the back part of the forearm or of this last forwards, had occurred as the result of acute inflammation. The only luxation, the result of acute arthritis in the region of the wrist, which has been noticed hitherto, has been that of the ulna backwards. This luxation is not an uncommon result of an attack of acute arthritis of the wrist, by which the ligament which connects the ulna to the cuneiform bone becomes softened and lengthened, and permits of the ulna being dis- located partially or completely backwards. Bonnet has commented on the frequency of this backward displacement of the ulna, and looks upon it as the smultaneous effect of the facility with which the ligamentous ties of this bone become softened and elongated, and of the faulty position in which the hand is kept by the patient, who remains usually in bed during these acute attacks, and pre- serves the forearm and hand in a state of complete pronation,—a position which favours the displacement of the ulna backwards. We have stated that acute arthritis of the wrist and carpal joints may be the result of inflammatory action, propagated from a wounded tendon of one of the fingers. The following is one of a few of those cases which had been admitted into the Richmond Hospital within a short period. Case. — John Murphy, a labourer, set. thirty-eight, while engaged in a fight with another labourer, received from him a bite in the little finger. The inflammation which fol- lowed involved the tendons and their sheaths, and spreading up the forearm, implicated in its passage the carpal anil meta-carpal joints as well as the wrist and radio-ulnar articula- tion, all of which became ultimately disorgan- ised. The amputation of the forearm, below the elbow-joint, became necessary. On making an anatomical examination it was found that there was complete disorganisation of the wrist- joint. All the bones of the carpus were loose and bathed in purulent matter. Chronic Strumous Arthritis of the Wrist, or White Swelling. — This is a disease which is generally considered to have its origin in the cancellous structure of the bones. It is fa- miliarly designated by many English writers by the well-known but somewhat equivocal name of " white swelling." When we take into consideration that the bones and the joints which compose the region of the wrist are very superficially placed, and that they are frequently subjected to sprains and concussions from falls on the palm of the hand, we need not be surprised to find that these numerous injuries become so many de- termining causes, giving rise to a chronic in- flammation of the bones and articular textures of the wrist, which frequently assumes the strumous character. As to the symptoms of this disease, we have to observe that the patient complains of pain, sometimes in one point of the wrist, sometimes in another, which is increased on the slightest motion. Soon a swelling ap- pears on the dorsum of the carpus, and the hand, from day to day, becomes more flexed on the forearm. After a time the region of the wrist assumes a globular form. The fore- arm, when compared with that of the opposite side, has an emaciated and wasted appearance. The patient usually has the hand supported on its palm, in the prone position, on some flat surface; the whole hand has a most helpless aspect; the fingers are swollen at their bases, and seem elongated and tapering towards their extremities : they are straight and motionless, and it is always with diffi- culty and pain that the patient moves them,— a circumstance we can easily account for, by recollecting that the inflammatory irritation which affects the wrist-joint is readily propa- gated to the tendons of the fingers which pass so immediately in front of it. The synovial membrane in these cases is early distended by an increased secretion into the interior of the sac, and a fluctuating swell- ing may be occasionally perceived posteriorly, as in the case of acute arthritis; but in the case of white swelling, instead of true fluctua- tion, there is in general nothing but a decep- tive feeling of it, from the infiltration of the tissues in the region of the wrist, by a glairy gelatiniform structure, similar to that which constitutes the chief bulk of white swellings in general. During the second period of the disease, the degree of flexion of the hand and of the wrist-joint becomes increased, and the lower extremity of the bones of the forearm, parti- cularly of the ulna, becomes very salient pos- teriorly. As the disease goes on, the bones of the carpus become more deeply carious ; chronic symptomatic abscesses form, and their contents make their way to the surface, which is frequently studded over, in advanced cases,WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1525 5 E 3 with the fistulous orifices of canals, which con- duct purulent matter from the centres of some of the carious bones, and from the interstices between them. At tiiis period of the disease we can, by holding the lower part of the forearm with one hand, and grasping the metacarpus with the other, move these parts laterally in opposite directions, clearly ascertaining that all the bones are loose and carious, and in an irrecoverable state of disorganisation. The constitution of the patient invariably sympa- thises deeply with this state of things ; ami the wasting effects of hectic fever are found usually coinciding with the disease of the wrist and carpus ; and, if amputation be not performed, the life of the patient may be sa- crificed. This operation, however, almost in- variably succeeds in arresting altogether the hectical symptoms, and the patient is restored to health. The scrofulous disease of the cancellous structure of the bones of the carpus, and of the carpal extremity of the radius, does not always proceed thus unfavourably. Occasion- ally, instead of suppuration, a resolution of the inflammatory action may ensue, or anchylo- sis, with partial displacement backwards of the bones of the forearm at ^he wrist-joint, may be established. This last, however, may be looked upon rather as an arrest of the morbid action than as a cure, because the patient is not only deprived of the use of the wrist, and sometimes of the medio-carpal joints, but also of the use of the fingers; in- flammatory action in these cases having been communicated to the flexor tendons and their sheaths, rigidity of the ligaments, or even anchylosis of the joints of the fingers, too generally follows as a natural consequence. It may here be asked, whether, in the pro- gress of this disease, the wrist-joint is liable to those spontaneous displacements of the bones which other articulations affected with white swelling seem to be. To which we reply, If we except the partial displacement backwards of the ulna, previously mentioned, these displacements must be considered as rare. Bonnet of Lyons, who has had much expe- rience, says he has not himself met with any case of spontaneous luxation of the hand, whether backwards or forwards, the result of disease ; nor has he read of any such recorded. Nelaton relates, however, that Richet showed him a preparation found in the dead-room, in which it was observed that the bones of the carpus had lost their usual relation to the radius, the inferior extremity of which was carried into the palm of the hand, while the bones of the carpus were carried back- wards on the dorsal surface of the forearm. Numerous fistulous orifices were seen, which evidently had, up to the period of the pa- tient's death, furnished a purulent discharge, so that the disease had not been completely cured, although it was manifest that the liga- ments had resumed their firmness and solidity, and that the luxation had taken place a long time previous to death. Here, then, is a reply in the affirmative to the quaere, whether spontaneous dislocation of the wrist-joint occur ; and an unquestion- able example of dislocation of the bones of the forearm forwards adduced, on the respect- able authorities of Nelaton and Richet. To this observation we may add the following, showing that complete dislocation backwards of both the bones of the forearm may occur at the wrist (seeJig. 936.); and here the testi- mony as to this fact rests also on the produc- tion of a specimen found in the dissecting room*; its history is unknown. By examin- ing. 936. ing this preparation, in which the dislocation backwards of both the bones of the forearm had evidently taken place, we can observe much overlapping of these bones on the dor- sum of the carpus, so that the styloid process of the dislocated radius quite overhangs the trapezium, even so far as the root of the meta-carpal bone of the thumb, and the ulna, lies in contact with the back of the cuneiform bone, so that the articular extremity of the radius has passed down for more than an inch below its ordinary situation ; the anterior sur- face of the bones of the forearm, when they lie on the dorsum of the carpal bones, are solidly united to them.

Arthritis, or White Swelling, of the Wrist. — When we remove the integuments from the wrist, in one of those advanced cases of chronic strumous disease of the radio-carpal and inter-carpal articulations, we encoun- ter the usual appearance of a gelatiniform effusion, of a yellowish-green colour ; we observe the tendons and nerves somewhat swelled, as if infiltrated; the ligaments all softened ; purulent matter occupying the in- terstices of the articular surfaces ; the bones easily yielding to pressure, hollow and carious in the centre of their cancillated tissue; and leading from these carious bones, are seen fistulous canals opening extensively by nu- merous orifices on the cutaneous surface of the wrist. In the Museum of the College of Surgeons of Dublin we find a preparation, which is truly designated as an instructive one, show- ing the effects of scrofulous disease on the bones and other structures of the wrist. To save the patient's life, it became necessary to perform an amputation of the forearm. The hand has been preserved in spirits, and the back of the carpus has been laid open to view. The wrist is semi-flexed ; the palm and fingers are swollen, and the front of the joint is studded with fistulous orifices. One soli- tary fistulous orifice appears in the centre of the palm. The bones of the carpus, deprived of their synovial membranes and ligaments, are loose and disjointed; and to use the words of the donor, the late Professor Todd, " they felt during life like a bag of marbles." There is also another preparation, styled " scrofulous disease of the carpus, meta-car- pus, and extremity of the radius," presented by Professor Porter. The bones are re- remarkably soft, light, and porous. The na- tural shape of each is considerably altered, by loss of substance in some parts, and de- posits of new osseous matter in others : the latter, wherever it exists, has a peculiar spi- culated appearance; some of the bones are increased in size, others diminished; the car- tilages have, for the most part, disappeared ; the synovial membrane of the smaller joints had been completely destroyed ; that of the radio-carpal articulation was hypertrophied, soft, and pulpy. The ligaments were not recognizable, and the bones lay almost loose in a quantity of purulent matter, with which a fistulous orifice, in the front of the joint, communicated. The skin, the cellular tissue, and the sheaths of the tendons were infil- trated with a thin gelatinous fluid ; the median and ulnar nerves were remarkably enlarged. The scrofulous disease, commencing in the centre of the cancellous structure of the bones of the carpus and carpal extremity of the radius, does not always proceed thus un- favourably. Anchylosis, with partial displace- ment of the forearm at the wrist-joint, may, as already stated, be established, as the result of the morbid action we are here treating of. In the Museum of Anatomy in Leyden there is a preparation of the bones of the wrist, in which the carpal extremity of the radius and ulna are much enlarged and remark- ably scabrous on their surface; the radius and ulna are anchylosed firmly with each other near to the carpus; the os lunare was united to both radius and ulna; the os sca- phoides, cuneiform and magnum, had totally disappeared; the trapezium was also firmly united to the meta-carpal bone of the thumb and with that of the index finger. In the above-mentioned Museum at Ley- den there is also another preparation, ex- hibiting anchylosis of the bones of the forearm, and of the carpus, at the wrist-joint, after the disease, which had arisen, we are told, from a scrofulous cause, had happily been cured. In concluding, then, the account of the anatomical characters of the scrofulous caries of the bones which compose the region of the wrist, we may observe, that, as a result of this disease, some of the carpal bones are di- minished in size in many cases, while in others they are enlarged. We have noticed some specimens in which two or three of the carpal bones have disappeared altogether, while others have had additional bony growths attached to them. The lower extremities of the bones of the forearm, in almost all the cases, were found rough and scabrous, and increased in bulk, particularly close to the wrist-joint. We, also, after our own examina- tion of the bones of the region of the wrist, have to make the same observation that Sandiford has made relative to the specimens he has preserved in the Anatomical Museum of Leyden, of which he says, — " Omnia hcec ossa levissima sunt."* Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis of the Wrist. — The wrist-joints, together with the joints of the carpus, are very frequently affected with the disease we have elsewhere, in this work, called " Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis," or rheumatic gout. When the joints which enter into the region of the wrist are engaged, the fingers are all more or less distorted, and their joints en- larged, as already described. (See Hand.) Females are more liable to have their wrist- joints affected with chronic rheumatic arth- ritis than males, and elderly persons more commonly than those who are young; but this disease is to be seen, occasionally, in young persons of both sexes. The disease, when it appears in the wrist-joint, will, in general, be found to affect, symmetrically, the right and left wrist of the patient. The cause of the disease is generally referred to rheu- matic fever, and the other articulations of the patient are usually more or less implicated. The patient complains of pain in the joints, particularly at night, of stiffness and rigidity, and of a crackling sensation in them when they are moved. When we come to examine the wrist, it is remarked to present a preter- natural convexity on its dorsal aspect, arising from an inordinate quantity of fluid poured out into the synovial sac of the joint. The * Museum Anatomicum, Sandiford, p. 244. vol. iii.1527 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). bursas of the extensor tendons, as they pass over the carpus, also become distended : these softer fluctuating swellings after a time sub- side, and the lower extremity of the radius and ulna, where they enter into the formation of the wrist-joint, enlarge; longitudinal ridges of bone can be felt on the back of the radius close to the wrist-joint. The ulna, besides being much hypertrophied at its lowest point, rises abnormally above the level of the dorsum of the carpus. When the disease has been of long duration, the region of the wrist becomes contracted, the back of the carpus and hand presents an attenuated appearance, showing the course of the tendons, and allowing the ridges and prominences of the bone to become visible. Anatomical Characters. — When we remove the fibrous covering of the tendons which pass by the back part of the wrist-joint and carpus, we find that these tendons are gene- rally deeply imbedded in bony sulci,or grooves. The capsular ligament and other fibrous struc- tures, both on the palmar and dorsal aspect of the joint, seem to be denser and stronger than natural. On examining the interior of the wrist- joint, we notice that all the articular carti- lages of encrustation have been removed from the ends both of the radius and ulna, and that the inter-articular fibro-cartilage, which intervenes between the lower extremity of the ulna and cuneiform bone of the carpus, is removed. In general, at the usual period we are afforded opportunities for making our ana- tomical examinations, we find but little left of the synovial membrane by which we can judge; but in some cases we have found red synovial fimbriae exist in the wrist-joint, just as we have noticed this same vascular condition of the synovial tissues to co-exist with the other anatomical characters of the chronic rheu- matic arthritis, as they have shown them- selves in other articulations which had been affected with this peculiar disease. Radius. — The lower extremity of the radius is usually somewhat enlarged, and the surface of the bone is scabrous from small exostotic growth. We find the grooves on the back of the radius for the passage of the extensor tendons are preternaturally deepened. The articular surface of the lower extremity of the radius, where formed for the reception of the summit of the carpus, is usually much hollowed out, and polished from porcellanoid deposition. The outline of the carpal sur- face of the altered radius is usually studded round with bony granules, or vegetations. When we look to the ulnar side of the lower extremity of the radius, we find the lesser synovial cavity for the reception of the carpal end of the ulna much enlarged, particularly in its antero-posterior diameter. This scaphoid cavity we find also presenting an eburnated surface, and on it fine parallel ridges and grooves are distinctly seen to run in the direction of the rotation of the ulna on the radius in pronation and supination. Where the lower extremity of the ulna con- fronts the cuneiform bone (the inter-articular fibro-cartilage having been removed), it pre- sents a smooth and polished surface. Ulna. — The carpal extremity of the ulna is frequently much enlarged, and furnished with exuberant bony growths ; its lowest ex- tremity, where it confronts the cuneiform bone of the carpus (without the intervention of cartilage), is smooth. The part of the ex- tremity destined for rotation on the radius is convex, and oval from before backwards, and of a form, of course, adapted to that of the little scaphoid cavity in the latter, and which is deprived of cartilage, eburnated, and simi- larly marked with corresponding parallel ridges and grooves. Carpus. — In our anatomical investigations into the state of the hands of those who have long laboured under chronic rheumatic ar- thritis, we have found the bones of the carpus to be much altered by this disease : in general, the region which these bones constitute will be found to have all its dimensions contracted within a smaller compass then natural. The form of each individual bone is so much changed, that, if found detached, it could scarcely be recognised as a carpal bone. The cartilaginous structure naturally intervening between all the bones is always absorbed. Cruveilhier has said that, in the anatomi- cal examination of one of his cases of this disease, he found the bones of the carpus confounded together into an irregular mass, so that it was difficult to say the part which each took in the construction of the carpal region. On examining, anatomically, the bones of the region of the wrist of a patient who had been ten years labouring under this disease, and was under our own immediate observation for almost the whole of this period, we found the bones of the carpus were exceedingly rough on their non-articular surfaces ; each individual bone was found much altered from its normal figure; some were enlarged beyond their usual size, others diminished : the true annular ligament of the carpus, which con- nected the small bones together on their palmar aspect, and contributed to maintain the arched form of this region, was much shorter than usual. When we examined each bone, we found that the scaphoid was eburnated on its su- perior articular surface, where it corresponded to a similar surface on the carpal end of the radius. Below, the scaphoid, instead of con- tributing, with the head of the os magnum, to form part of the medio-carpal articulation, was really united to the head of the os mag- num by true bony anchylosis. The semi- lunar and cuneiform of the first range were much enlarged. The os lunare, where, by its lower concave surface, it corresponded to half of the head of the magnum, was not, like the scaphoid, united to this last bone, but, on the contrary, both surfaces of the magnum * Vide a work on Chronic Rheumatic Arthritis, by the author, shortly to be published. 5 e 4WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). 1528 and lunar bones, which confronted each other, were covered with an ivory-like polish. The trapezium, where it supported the first phalanx of the thumb, was polished on its pulley-like articular surface. The trapezoides was much diminished in size, and solidly anchylosed with the first phalanx of the index finger. The transverse diameter of the magnum was not one quarter of an inch ; and the loss of breadth to this degree accounted somewhat for the abnormal narrowing of the carpus already noticed. The cuneiform was normal, as well as the pisiform. The junction, then, of the magnum with the scaphoid, and the equally solid bony union of the trapezoides with the meta-carpal bone of the index finger, were the only articulations of this region, or, indeed, of the whole skeleton of this individual, which presented specimens of true bony anchylosis. The cause of the eburnation of the surfaces of some of the carpal bones might have been that these bones bore occasionally much of the weight of the man in progression, because he had been much disabled in his lower limbs, and habitually used crutches. Synovial Tumours of the Region of the Wrist. — Synovial tumours generally present them- selves around the joints of the extremities ; and the wrist seems especially liable to them. By the term synovial tumours of the wrist, we do not mean those formed by an increased effusion into the proper synovial sac of the radio-carpal articulation, but enlargements constituted by bursa? in this region. Synovial cysts, called ganglions, are fre- quently seen on the back of the wrist and carpus. They are of a globular form, and, as to size, vary from that of a hazel-nut to that of a walnut. They are usually situated at the level of the medio-carpal articulation in the course of the extensor tendons as they pass to the carpus. These tumours are slightly moveable, indolent, and painless, without any alteration in the colour of the skin which covers them from that which is natural. The contents of these little swellings are found to be synovia of a variable consistency : some- times it is serous and limpid ; occasionally the contents are constituted by a thick trans- parent jelly. The cyst seems to be formed by the reticular tissue which immediately covers the sheath of the extensor tendons. The part of the cyst which corresponds to the skin is united to it by a layer of very thin cellular tissue, but loose enough to allow of the skin being easily raised up. The part, on the contrary, which is deeply situated reposes in the sheath of the tendons, or the capsular ligament of the wrist, and is firmly connected to them. This union is sometimes so inti- mate that it is impossible to take away the cyst without interfering with the tendon or the articular capsule. The thickness of this cyst varies much. Sometimes it is thin and translucent, and it breaks when subjected to but little pressure; at other times its thickness and its texture are such that the most violent efforts cannot rup- ture it. We have usually seen this disease in fe- males more than in males; and the cause of the origin of these little tumours in the wrists of the former appeared to us frequently attri- butable to over-exertion, such as prolonged playing on some musical instruments, such, for example, as the harp or piano. Whatever may have been the cause for the origin of these encysted tumours, once formed, they for a time increase in a gradual manner ; and when they have attained a moderate size, they cease to grow. They sometimes, though rarely, subside spontaneously. The interior of the membranous sac, m the distention of which, by a glairy fluid, the tu- mour consists, is smooth and polished. The interior of these cysts generally have no com- munication whatever either with the medio- carpal or wrist-joint itself; but Velpeau says he has seen two cases in which he could easily press the liquid contained in the cyst into the articulation of the wrist if he at the same time gave certain movements to the joint. He adds, that twice he had an oppor- tunity, in the dead body, to show that these cysts communicated with the interior of the joint. Morbid Condition of the Synovial Bursts of the Flexor Tendons.—The swellings which these enlarged bursa; constitute, do not pre- sent the same regularity of form that gan- glions do. The cause of their origin may generally be referred to some great exertion— to a fall or other external violence. I have known, in one case, one of these swellings appear with- out having been produced by any injury. The constitution of this patient was very decidedly of the rheumatic character. The species of swelling we are now refer- ring to commences in the synovial bursa which envelopes the flexor tendons of the fingers as they pass beneath the anterior an- nular ligament of the wrist: the swelling con- sists of an increased quantity of synovial fluid effused into the cavity of the little sac the bursa constitutes. At first the effusion is small, and the bursa keeps within its normal boundary, behind the anterior annular liga- ment ; but the accumulation of synovia in- creases by degrees; and then the swelling appears divided into two parts, which are separated from each other by the annular ligament, which seems to form a transverse band which constricts the sac, leaving a tu- mour above the annular ligament in front of the wrist, and another beneath the level of this ligament in the palm. Pressure on the portion of the sac above makes the synovial fluid pass down into the part of the bursal sac beneath. In these cases the skin pre- serves its colour and normal mobility, the fin- gers become somewhat flexed, and there is some difficulty experienced in fully extending them. The patient suffers no pain, but only complains of a numbness and weakness in the fingers, hand, and wrist. On compressing one of the extremities of this tumour (as, for example, that placed * Diotionnaire de Mc'decine, torn. 25, pi. 294.1529 WRIST-JOINT (Abnormal Anatomy). above the annular ligament), while the fingers of the opposite hand are placed on the other extremity, which is placed beneath this fibrous band, we readily perceive a "frotte- ment " which is quite peculiar. This " f'rotte- ment" is caused by the passage to and fro, under the true annular ligament of the wrist, of small foreign bodies which are not unlike barley grains or those of boiled rice. Their forms are exceedingly variable. They are usually of a white colour, and have a polished surface. They are found in vast numbers in the same cyst, mixed with a more or less con- siderable quantity of glairy synovial liquid. They are ordinarily free from all adhesions to the parietes of the bursa. Many theories have been formed as to the origin of these little bodies found loose in the bursa, about the wrist, and elsewhere. Dupuytren thought he had established the theory that they were hydatids. Laennec and Raspail agreed with him in this view; but Bosc, to whom Dupuytren referred, dissented. The last-mentioned naturalist looked upon them as concretions of lymph of an adipo- cerous nature. He says, " They are not to be considered as ' hydatids,' because they have not given any sign of life on escaping from the cyst." On dividing these bodies, he found them uniform throughout, whilst that of hydatids are always hollow ; and again, because submitted to a strong lens, they have appeared to him to be nothing else than an inorganic mass, whether he examined them when recent or dried." Sir Benjamin Brodie's opinion now seems generally to prevail. It is adopted by Nelaton * and other French physiologists : — " There seems to be no doubt but that these loose bodies have their origin in the coagu- lated lymph which was etFused in the early stages of the disease ; and I had opportuni- ties, by the examination of several cases, to trace the steps of their gradual formation. At first the coagulated lymph forms irregular masses of no determined shape, which after- wards, by the motion and pressure of the contiguous parts, are broken down into small portions. These by degrees become of a regular form, and assume a firmer consist- ence, and at last are converted into the oval bodies above alluded to.""j" Examples of these have been seen in the svnovial sheaths of the radial extensors as well as on the back of the wrist in the course of the extensors of the fingers. But it is, nevertheless, certain that the bursa of the flexor tendons, situated in front of the wrist and carpus, and behind the true annular liga- ment of this region, is the special locality in which these foreign bodies are most frequently found. Painful Crepitation of Tendons around the Wrist. —We notice, sometimes, around the carpus and in the inferior extremity of the * En 1819 M.

(Nelaton, Pathclogie Chirurgicale.") j- Brodie on the Diseases of the Joints. forearm, a swelling which is peculiar in this, that, whenever the tendons around which the swelling forms are moved, there is thereby elicited a very peculiar crepitation. This crepitation is noticed along the course of the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevior, and in that of the long abductor and short extensor of the thumb. This swelling is not globular, nor is it so well defined as a ganglion, but may be said to represent in its form a portion of a spiral which, parting from the dorsal surface of the forearm, soon turns round the external part of the radius to gain the root of the first metacarpal bone. This swelling seems to be of an inflamma- tory nature, and is occasionally accompanied with a superficial redness of the skin ; and pressure on this part becomes painful to the patient. If the surgeon places his thumb or fingers on the postero-external surface of the forearm, near to the wrist-joint, where the ob- long swelling exists, and at the same time de- sires the patient to move the hand by flexing and extending the wrist-joint, or exert the muscles, the peculiar crepitation which cha- racterises this lesion is soon perceived. It is not very easy to convey an idea of this crepitation; but it has been compared by many to that produced by the crushing to- gether, with our fingers, portions of finely powdered starch, or to the effect which we feel produced when we walk over snow. When once recognised, it is perceived to be quite different from that crepitation which is produced by the movement on each other of the fragments of broken bones or the rubbing- together of roughened articular surfaces. This disease has for its anatomical seat the fibro-synovial sheaths of the tendons already mentioned. These extensor tendons, namely, the two extensor radialis longior and brevior, as well as those of the long abductor and short extensor of the thumb, cross each other, each in special sheaths or canals formed on the back part and external edge of the lower extremity of the radius ; and if inflammation attack the lining membrane of these fibro-synovial sheaths, it is plain that, in this anatomical arrangement, there may be seen many circum- stances to favour the development of this crepitation. This affection has not, we believe, ever been observed to have come on sponta- neously, but generally to have arisen from some violent and continued efforts of the wrist and hand. It has been noticed in soldiers and masons, and in those who are in the habit of twisting the forearm, as in the act of forced pronation of the forearm of washerwomen in wringing clothes. The tumefaction, the swelling, pain and heat, and the crepitation also, once com- menced, augment generally for four, six, or eight days ; and if the patient be guilty of any imprudence, the evil is maintained to the same degree even to the twelfth or fourteenth day, after which it ordinarily terminates in resolution. (^Robert Adams.)Addendum to the Article Urethra. *#* In justice to a distinguished anatomist and surgeon, Mr. Henry Hancock, whose claims to priority of the discovery of unstriped muscular fibres in the urethra were over- looked by the author of the article Urethra, the Editor thinks it right, with the as- sent of the author of that article, to insert the following paragraph, drawn up by Mr. Hancock, as an addendum to it: — The urethra itself is a membranous tube, consisting of mucous membrane, presenting villi on its free surface for the most part arranged in rows, some being conical, others tuberculated, covered by epithelial scales. The outer surface of the urethra is closely invested by cellular tissue, external to which is found a layer of organic muscular fibres, similar to, and in fact continuous with, the muscular coat of the bladder. This last- named structure consists of two layers, an internal and an external ; the external passes forwards on the outside of the prostate gland ; the internal, on the contrary, accom- panies the mucous lining of the bladder, when it becomes urethral through the prostate gland, forming a covering of involuntary muscular fibre to the canal in its passage through the gland. In front of the prostate, the two layers of muscular fibre unite and invest the membranous portion of the urethra, where they may easily be distinguished from the voluntary muscles of the part. Reaching the bulb they again separate into an internal and an external layer; the internal continues forwards to the orifice of the urethra, lying between that canal and the corpus spongio- sum ; the external passes on the outer sur- face of the corpus spongiosum, separating it from its fibrous investment, to which the fibres adhere pretty closely. These latter, like the internal, are continued forward to the orifice of the urethra, and in their course they invest the spongy portion of the bulb, the urethra, and the glans penis, entering very largely into the formation of the peculiar structure found at the orifice of the urethra, and which appears to consist almost entirely of involuntary muscle and cellular tissue. Hence, the corpus spongiosum urethras lies between two layers of involuntary muscle, the one separating it from the urethra, the other from its fibrous investment; and this arrangement obtains wherever the corpus spongiosum exists, whether the quantity thereof be small or great. On the under and lateral portion of the urethra, where the quan- tity is abundant, the corpus spongiosum lies between two layers of involuntary muscular fibre. On the upper surface of the urethra, where the quantity is comparatively small, the same arrangement may be observed, whilst at the glans, which is not formed merely by increased development of the spongy tissue, but also by a folding back, as it were, of the spongy tissue over the corpora cavernosa, we find these muscular layers multiplied.ANALYTICAL TO THE FOURTH VOL INDEX U M E.

Sixth Pair of Nerves, 621. visible origin of the nerve, 621. connected with the sympathetic nerve, 621. physiology of the sixth nerve, 622. Skeleton, 622. law of unity in variety, 622. vertebra? are unequal quantities, 621. even the one vertebra is not of equal quantity in all individuals of the same species, 625. all vertebra? contain a greater or less amount of certain known elemental pieces, 625. the dorsal vertebra of human anatomy is an artificial figure, 625. the cervical vertebra developes the costal appendages, 626. all the cervical vertebra? develope costal appendages, 627. the lumbar vertebra developes the costal appendages, 627. all the lumbar vertebra? develope costal appendages. 628. the sacral vertebra? develope costal appendages, 628. the coccygeal vertebra? are deprived of their costal ap- pendages, 629. the first seven thoracic costo-vertebral figures are whole or plus quantities, 629. the five asternal costo-vertebral forms are propor- tionals metamorphosed from five sternal costo-verte- bral plus quantities, 630.1536 ANALYTICAL INDEX. Skeleton (.continued). the five lumbar vertebra? are proportionals metamor- phosed from five sternal costo-vertebral archetypes, 630. the sacro-coccygeal series of vertebra? are proportionals degraded from sternal costo-vertebral circles, 631. the seven cervical vertebrae are proportionals degraded from seven sterno-costo-vertebral whole quantities, 631. the mammalian spinal axis consists of a series pf seg- mental quantities, whose only variety or specific dis- tinction depends upon proportioning from the whole thoracic quantities, 031. uniformity of structure is a condition proper to the plus thoracic originals of the spinal axis of the mamma, lian body, 632. every spinal segment which is lesser refers to every spinal segment which is greater, and all lesser seg- ments refer to that which is greatest, 633. structural uniformity cannot characterise such spinal segments as are proportionally or quantitatively va- rious, 633. specific variety is none other than proportional variety, 633. the knowledge of the differential quantity between all spinal segments renders them exactly uniform in idea, 633. without knowing the full dimensions of whole or uni- form quantities, we can never rightly understand the real character of lesser and special forms, and there- fore can never otherwise understand the law of formation, 634. the mammalian cervix is not limited to the fixed num- ber of seven cervical vertebra?, 634. the number of ceivical vertebra? in the mammal cervix depends upon the number of archetypal costo-ver- tebral figures which have suffered metamorphosis, 635. the presence of cervical ribs subtracts from the number of cervical vertebra;, and adds to the number of thoracic archetypes, 636. the length of the thorax depends upon the number of persistent costo-vertebral archetypes, 636. the numerical length of the lumbar spinal region de- pends upon the number of archetypes subjected to metamorphosis, 637. the numerical length of the sacral and coccygeal series is not fixed, and this is owing to the same fact of archetypes undergoing metamorphosis, 637. a comparison of the same numerical vertebra? in all human spinal axes will prove the truth of the pre- sent interpretation of the law which governs the development of all vertebral forms, not only in the same spine, but all other spines, 637. the anomaly is a link in the chain of form, 638. all the spinal segments of all classes and species of ver. tebrated animals are only as the variable propor- tionals of sterno-costo-vertebral archetypes, 638. the hyoid apparatus occurs opposite to the cervical spinal region, where we know costal quantity to be lost; the hyoid apparatus refers to the cervical ver- tebra;, and consists of their ribs metamorphosed, 640. the ventral apparatus occurs opposite to the lumbar spinal region, where we understand that costal quan- tity is lost; the ventral apparatus refers to the lumbar vertebra;, and consists of their ribs metamorphosed, 643. clavicles, coracoid bones, and ribs are identical parts of the costo-vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, 644. marsupial bones, pubic and ischiadic bones and ribs, are identical parts of the costo-vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, 648. chevron bones and ribs are identical parts of the costo- vertebral whole quantities or archetypes, 650. the sternal median line ranges from the maxilla to the pubic bones of the abstract archetypal skelatal fabric, 651. every fossil skeletal species of extinct animals, as well as every recent existing species of skeleton, are forms created of the archetypal skeleton, 655. the cranio-facial apparatus consists, like the thoracic apparatus, of variable proportionals of the sterno- costo-vertebral quantities, 655. the scapulary or fore-limbs of all the vertebrated ani- mals are homologous to one another ; the variety among these organs occurs by a metamorphosis or omission of elementary quantity, 661. the scapulary and pelvic members are homologous, 654. the sterno-costo-vertebral quantily is a proportional of the dorso-ventral quantity, 667. the scapulary and pelvic pairs of limbs are proportional quantities metamorphosed from the dorso-ventral archetypes, 669. the cranio-facial apparatus of segments are propor- tionals of the dorso-ventral archetypes, 673. the cranio-facial apparatus is the origin of the dorso- ventral archetypal series, and the caudal apparatus is its termination, 673. the uniform archetypal series undergoes a graduated metamorphosis of its quantities for the production of all varieties of skeletal species, 674.

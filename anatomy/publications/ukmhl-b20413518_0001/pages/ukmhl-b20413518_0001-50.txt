Applied Anatomy: 32 2. A steel director is much used: upon this deep fasciaj and aponeuroses are divided, and it is furtlier to be used to separate muscular interspaces, and also to separate the arterj^ from its sheath. 3. When the sheath is opened the knife is to he laid aside and the vessel cleared by the director and forceps alone. I may here say that if a director is to be used at all to clear the vessel, the most convenient form to employ is, not the straight steel director, hut the ordinary German silver one, with a short curve at the lower end, the concavity of the curve being turned towards the grooved side (Tig. 10). Fig. 10. The Director. 4. The aneurism needle is to be passed unthreaded, and any tissue preventing the easy passage of its point round the artery, is to be scratched through with the thumb nail, or the scalpel cutting against the needle with the edge away from the artery. ° Should the director I have figured be used, the best way to pass it is as follows:—A small opening having been made in the sheath, the external edge of the opening is to be grasped by a pan- of ordinary catch forceps (Pean's forceps wUl do equally weU), and criven to an assistant, whUe the operator seizes the edge next himself with the dissecting forceps ; gentle traction should then be made and in this way, the posterior part of the sheath is gently stretched between the two pairs of forceps, and is thus steadied and prevented from rolling and doubling before the point of the director, the curved part of which then slips round the artery very readily. When the point appears at the other side, the edges of the opening m the sheath are let go, the Surgeon takes the aneurism needle and lays its point into the groove on the director, withdraws the director, and at the same moment carries the needle round the artery so that as the director retreats it carries the needle with it ihe needle is then threaded and withdrawn, and the ligature tied m the ordinary way.

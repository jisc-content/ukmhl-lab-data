Applied Anatomy: 10 CHAPTER II. TREATMENT OF ANEURISM. The treatment of Aneurism is-divided into Medical and Surgical; but in practice it is always better to combine them. MEDICAL. This includes—(1) Rest in bed in the recumbent posture, or in such a position as to impede the supply to, but to assist the return from, the aneurism; at the same time, paying special attention to the general health, giving a light, simple, unstimulatmg diet, but one nevertheless sufficient for the needs of the body, and avoid- ing all excitement, either mental or physical. (2) Depletion m moderation to reduce excessive vascular action; it also seems to increase the relative amount of fibrin in the blood. The effect on the circidation is not lasting; but this is no objection, as all that is wanted is a temporary lowering of the force of the circulation in order to allow the blood in the sac to hegin to clot. This was Valsalva's plan, only he carried it to excess, and it consequently feU into disrepute. In carrying out this method, the pulse must be carefully watched and depletion stopped at once, should there seeiu any tendency to syncope. (3) Gradual starvation, especially of fluids (TuFNELL), with the intention of reducing the total amount of blood in the body, and also the force of the heart's action. _ The diet is to be chiefly farinaceous, and alcohol must not be given, bv some it is recommended, after coagulation has commenced that /liberal proportion of animal food should be allowed, m order to nctase tL Lount of fibrin in the blood.

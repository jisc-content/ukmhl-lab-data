Further, the depres- sion in fracture is not immediately under the acromion process as in dislocation, but at some distance below this point-below the ower end of the upper fragment, a little above the insertion of the deltoid. In imj^aded fracture there is no mobility, displace- ment, nor crepitus. In this case the lower fragment usually penetrates into the cancellous tissue of the superior-the reverse of impacted fracture of the anatomical neck. The sicrus of this condition are obscure, and chiefly of a negative character-. Fig. 81. Fracture through Surgical Neck. Axis of unbroken Humerus.

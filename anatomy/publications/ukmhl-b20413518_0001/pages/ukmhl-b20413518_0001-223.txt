205 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. lu Professor Chiene's method (see Pig. 35, C), the hiuid is held in the usual manner, and the point of a sharp bistoury is entered just over the metacarpo - phalangeal articulation, and carried for about half-way round the lateral aspects of tlie root of the finger to bo removed. From this point two lateral incisions are made along the sides of the finger parallel with its dorsal surface, and these are next joined by a gently curved transverse incision across the palmar aspect of the finger just through the crease between the first and second phalanges. This flap is then held aside by an assistant; the tendons are cut off short near the base of the flap, and the finger is cleared from its further connections and removed. The flap is then turned up and fixed to the edge of the dorsal wound by a few points of suture. When the wound heals it leaves a meat, horse-shoe-like cicatrix on the dorsal aspect of the hand, â€¢well away from the palm (Fig. 39). Fig. 40. Professor Chiene's Amputation. Sliowhig the Finger after l!cmoval. (Fvfmi a fast kindly lent by Professor Ciiikne.) THE INDEX AND LITTLE FINGER. In the case of the index finger (see Fig. 35, tlic oval incision, or tlic " racket-sliaped " modification, is to be preferred. The straight part of tlie incision may be made either on the lateral or dorsal aspect of the hand; in cither case ilio incision is carried forwards to tlic licad of tlie mcitacarpal bono, and tlion the oval made round the root of tlic finger. TJie lateral form gives a single lateral linear cicatrix well away from tlie palm, and also out^of sight, and is probably tlie best form to use in the iqiiier classes ; but in workmen tlie straight part nf the incision sliould lie on tin!

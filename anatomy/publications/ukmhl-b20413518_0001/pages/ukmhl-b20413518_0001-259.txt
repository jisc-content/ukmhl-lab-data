The reason for this modification is the supposed advantage gained by leaving the whole of the internal cuneiform bone, to which the tendons of°both the tibialis anticus and the tibialis posticus are partiaUy attached. But even in Key's operation the attachments of these muscles are Fig. 45. Tarsus and Metatarsus. 1. Astragalus. 2. Os Calais. 3. Cuboid. 4. Scaphoid. 5. External Cimeiform. 6. Middle Cuneiform. 7.

Note. — The sigmoid curve formed by the line of Chopart's amputation; also the mortise formed by the three cuneiform bones, into which the base of tlie second metatarsal juts. not destroyed ; for, although anatomists figure certain points on hones as the attachments of tlie muscles in question, yet it is found practically that tliey have extensive attachments to the deep ligamentous structures in their neighbourhood ; so that this disa.lvantage, as urged against Hey's operation, is more imaginary than real. Anotlier objection urged against Hey's amputation is that a cancellous bone is divided, and that there is therefore a Q

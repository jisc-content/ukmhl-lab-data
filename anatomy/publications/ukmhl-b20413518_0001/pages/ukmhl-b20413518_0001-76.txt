Applied A uatoviy: 58 CHAPTER VI. SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. Origin. Ou tlie rigU side from tlie branching of tlie innominate artery behind the sterno-clavicular articulation. On the left side directly from the arch of the aorta. Extent (in neck).—From the sterno-clavicular articulation, or opposite the interval between the two heads of the sterno-mastoid, to the lower border of the first rib. It is divided into three parts by the scalenus anticus muscle—a part internal to (first part); a part behind (second part); and a part external to that muscle (third part). Course.—It crosses the lower part of the neck, taking an arched course over the apex of the pleura and first rib, passing between the anterior and middle scaleni muscles, and ends opposite the middle of the clavicle. It usually rises about one inch above the clavicle. The right subclavian is about three inches long, the left is one inch longer. RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN.—First Part. This part extends from the right sterno-clavicular articulation to the inner edge of the scalenus anticus muscle. An aneurism of the first part of the subclavian usually presents as a pulsating tumour external to the sterno-mastoid muscle, more or less elongated trans- versely, with bruit propagated into tlie axilla, which is unaltered when the common carotid is compressed. The right side is more frequently affected in the proportion of three to one, probably because the right arm is more used than the left. Relations.— fro7it.—{\) Skin and superficial fascia; (2) platysma; (3) deep 'fascia; (4) three muscles—sterno-mastoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno- thyroid • (5) three veins—internal jugular, vertebral, and anterior iu<^ular- (0) three nerves-vagus, branches of sympathetic (cardiac, and anstc Yieusonii), and phrenic (the phrenic is always m front

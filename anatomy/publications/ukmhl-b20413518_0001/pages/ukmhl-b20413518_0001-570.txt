A curious train of Eye Symptoms ai'e often obseiTed in the disease known as Locomotor Ataxia, a disease consisting in chronic inflammation, followed by sclerosis of the postero-external tract of the cord (Burdach's), spreading to the postero-internal column and probably to the direct cerebellar tract as well. The symptoms observed are—(1) The Argyll PiOBErtsox symptom (see page -346); (2) temporanj paralysis of the A^irious ocular nerves with accom- panying symptoms; (3) marked myosis, the pupil being often contracted to a pin point; (4) frequently unequal size of the pupils; (5) colour blindness; and, lastly, (G) atrophy of the optic nerve and gradual loss of sight. A remarkable train of symptoms is frequently observed to follow " Concussion of the Spine," e.g., in railway injuries; we may find any one of the following five:—(1) Asthenopia; (2) amblyopia; (3) loss, or failure, of the power of accommodation; (4) irritability of the eye and photopsia, from neuro-retinitis; and, lastly, (.5) atrophy of the optic nerve and gradual loss of sight.

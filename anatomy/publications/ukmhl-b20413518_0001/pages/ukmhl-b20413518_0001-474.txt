460 Applied Anatoviy: than the inner (nhiar) side, as the strong inferior radio-uhiar lioaments oppose the displacement at that side, and it is m this way that the hand is incUned to the radial side, as well as heing slightly dorsiflexed. The head of the ulna seems unduly pro- minent (Fig. 92), but this is not due to any displacement of the bone but is due to the hand being displaced to the radial side and carried away from it, so that the styloid process seems carried forwards, as well as being too prominent. Very frequently there is a specially tender spot over the articulation between the radius and the ulna. The fracture is to be recognised by the appearance of the hand, history of the case, age of the patient, and by the fact that he is unable to supinate the fore-arm; and, by passing the fingers gently along the posterior surface of the lower end of the radius, the ridge formed by the displaced upper end of the lower fragment will usually be felt. Also the prommences and depressions about the wrist, the flexion of the fingers, and pro- minence of the head of the ulna, and, above all, the position of the styloid processes-ill health, the styloid process of the radius is on a lower level than that of the ulna; but m fracture the position is reversed, the ulnar being on a level with, or below, the radial Another symptom of some importance is the obliteration of the natural hollow on the front of the lower end of the radius, its place being occupied by a prominence. Accordin- to Professor Chiene, when a person falls on his palm, if the angle between the fore-arm and the ground is le,s than sixty decrees, the whole shock is borne by the lower end of the i-adius, an°d a Colles's fracture is the result; but if the angle be c,reaU, than sixty degrees, the shock passes up the bones of the fore-arm and the result is either a severe sprain of the wrist, or a dislocation of both bones backwards at the elbow.

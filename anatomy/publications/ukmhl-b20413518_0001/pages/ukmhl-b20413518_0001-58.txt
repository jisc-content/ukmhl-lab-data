Relations. â€” Behind, it lies against the vertebral column following the dorsal curve; it also crosses the vena azygos minor inferior, and sometimes the vena azygos minor superior. Fig. 11. CESOPHAGUS AND THORACIC AORTA. CEsophagus. Aorta. In front, it is covered by the pericardium, crossed transverselj' by the root of the left lung, and very obliquely by the oesophagus. To the right side, we find the oesophagus (at its upper part), vena azygos major, and thoracic duct. To the left side, the oesophagus (at its lower part), pleura, and left lung.

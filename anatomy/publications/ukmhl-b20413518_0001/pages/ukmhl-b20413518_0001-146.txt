First command the brachial artery so as to stop aU bleeding, clear out the wound, and apply the pads of lint clnj, because if applied moist they act as a poultice and encourage bleeding. The compress must be conical m shape, the narrow end resting against the bleeding vessel, the pads becoming larger and larger as the surface is poached; then a],;iy a mass of antiseptic wool, and a bandage over all The compress may be kept on for twelve hours. In using this method for the artificial arrest of hemorrhage, it is necessary that there ^^^^^f^^T^;^ thine, firm behind the vessel j in the case of the palmar archies we have the metacarpal bones The press e exercised need not be great: it has been found tha ;jessure equal to a quarter of an ounce, propeily applied, AviU .stop the blcediug.

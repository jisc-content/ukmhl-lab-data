The knee is now to be forcibly flexed while the Surgeon divides the lateral ligaments, which allows slight separation of the bones, and he next divides the crucial ligaments by cutting dmon upon the head and spine of tibia, so as to avoid any risk of injury to the popliteal vessels. The bones are now held semiflexed, and the femur raised so as to project its condyles, which are then to be cleared for the saw, the bones of the leg being at the same time pulled toAvards the table. The part to be removed is then grasped with the lion forceps and held by an assistant while the Surgeon himself steadies the thigh, and choosing a broad-Uaded amputating saw divides the femur through the highest point of the articular surface, and at right angles to the shaft, in the antero-posterior direction, but parallel with the articular surfaces in the transverse—"pamllel to the condyles, and perpendicular to the shaft" (Heath), in order to avoid any tendency either to knock-knee or bow-leg. The leg is now forcibly flexed carrying the foot backwards, so as to project the head of the tibia, which is to be cleared for the saw by means of a blunt-pointed knife, lest the vessels behind be injured. The femur is then steadied by the assistant in charge, while the tibia is drawn in front of it, and supported vertically while the operator holds its upper part firmly Avith his left hand and removes a thin slice with the broad-bladed saw. The section of the tibia must be parallel with its articular surface, and at right angles to its long axis,—/.e., at riglit angles to its shaft in both directions. In using the broad-bladed saw, the section of both femur and tibia as the Surgeon now stands, is made from before backwards; but if preferred a Butcher's saAV may be used, and the division made from behind forwards, ljut it is more difficult by this plan to secure a perfectly flat surface; after this the projecting corners of the femoral section are rounded off Avith the bone pliers, and the diseased pulpy membrane removed Avith the scissors or sharp spoon. In cases where the condyles of the femur do not retain their normal shape or obliquity, the guide given by Erichhen is the fol- lowing :—" The patient lying flat on his back, the tliigh is flexed

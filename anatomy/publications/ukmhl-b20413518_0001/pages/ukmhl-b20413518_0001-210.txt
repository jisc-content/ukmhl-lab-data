Applied Anatomy: 192 llap is made by dissection and tlie posterior by transfixion, as in the upper arm and thigh, he should stand on the right side of the limb to be removed. In circular amputations he may stand either on the right or left side, as may be found most convenient; while in pure and classical transfixion he should stand on the left side of the limb to be removed. Position of tlie Patient—In a general way, in amputating the Upper Extremity, the patient should be brought well to the edge of the table, next the operator—the part to be removed projecting beyond it; in amputating the Lower Extremity, he should be drawn well down towards the end of the table, so ' that the part to be removed may project well beyond it, and be hold there by an assistant, seated on a Ioav stool in front of the patient—the sound leg being secured by a clove hitch to a leg of the operating table. Dressing the Stump.—The vessels having been all secured, the surface of the Avound should be washed Avith a warm antiseptic solution, and then sponged dry. After this the edges of the flaps must be adjusted and kept in apposition by sutures; as good as any are the non-absorbable and non-absorbent sutures .of horse- liair-—the deep sutures consisting of double hairs, the superficial of single; and in both, cases, when tying, put the first knot twice through before tightening it, to prevent it slipping or slackening. The Deep sutures are known as " sutures of support and relaxa- tion" as they bear the strain and relax the edges of the wound; the first one should be inserted" at the centre of the flap, and others midway between this suture and the angles of the wound, and so on till the flaps are sufficiently supported and relaxed. These deep sutures should get a good hold of the skin and fat for at least an inch from the edges of the wound; sometimes the silver-wire button suture is used for a similar purpose. Between the "deep" sutures finer sutures must be inserted, in order to bring the skin edges into accurate apposition; these Superficial sutures are knoAvn as " sutures of apposition or co-ajyiation." ^ lu introducing the superficial sutures be careful to avoid tension, in-turning of the cut edge of the skin, or protrusion of pieces of fat or blood-clot between the edges of the wound. After this, perforated rubber drainage-tubes must be introduced near the

234 Applied Anatomy: 3. Upper two Thirds.—The modified circular, or equal antero- posterior flaps, made by dissection; the method of making the anterior by transfixion is of doubtful advantage, and certainly should never be practised in cases of amputation from injury. 4. The Elbow Joint.—By a very long anterior flap with a short posterior, or else the modified circular. .5. Just above the Elbow.—The old circular, or equal antero- posterior flaps. 6. Lower part of Humerus.—Equal antero-posterior flaps by dissection; the method of making the posterior by transfixion is of doubtful advantage, but may be practised on the dead body. 7. Just below the Deltoid Insertion.—Equal lateral flaps by dissection; higher than this use equal antero-posterior flaps by dissection. 8. The Shoulder Joint.—Mr Spexce's or the " oval" method (Larrey's). In cases of doubt between excision and amputation, always use Mr Spence's method (see "Excision of Shoulder"). The double flap, by dissection, is also a very good method.

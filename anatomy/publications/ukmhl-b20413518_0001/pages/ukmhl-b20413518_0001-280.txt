The anterior tibial artery lies in the middle of this flap, but it is very close to the interosseous membrane, and shoidd the flap be raised in the ordinary way by the knife, the artery is very apt to be punctured during the dissection; to avoid this undesirable accident—as the nutrition of the flap depends on this vessel—we Fig. 54.

To render this more easy the lateral incisions, marking the limits of the anterior flap, should go through all the soft tissues down to the bone, especially on the fibular side, on account of the intimate attach-

135 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. Relations.—The relations dilfer somewhat on the two sides. Right Common Iliac.—This vessel rests against its own vein at the lower part, and at the upi^er part crosses the vein of the opposite side. In front there are—(1) The small intestines (end of the ileum and caecum); (2) peritoneum; (3) sympathetic nerves; (4) crossed by the ureter near its termination (on the right side, however, the ureter often crosses the external iliac, not the common). On its outer side are—(1) The right common iliac vein ; (2) the commencement of the vena cava inferior. Its internal relations are unimportant. Left Common Iliac.—The left common iliac rests on the psoas magnus. In fi-onf are—(1) The rectum and the sigmoid flexure; (2) peritoneum; (3) sym^Dathetic nerves; (4) crossed by the ureter near its termination, and the inferior mesenteric vessels. Fig. 25. Iliac Arteries and Veins. On its outer side is tlie psoas magnus. On its i7i7ier side, the left common iliac vein. The relation of the common iliac veins to their corresponding arteries should be noted (Fig. 25). The inferior vena cava is formed by tlie union of the two common iliac veins on the ri{/ht side of the vertebral column, and both veins lie on the right side of, and on a plane posterior to, their corresponding arteries. On the riyht aide the vein is at first

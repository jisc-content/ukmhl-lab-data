Applied Anatomy: 332 Total excision of the wrist, as above described, is seldom advisable. A rigid anterior splint, with or without elastic exten- sion of the wrist joint, to keep the diseased surfaces at rest and apart, counter irritation, and, if deemed necessary, the hypodermic injection of iodoform or carbolic acid, combined with good food and open-air exercise, may check the disease and preserve a useful, though crippled hand. The arm must be carried in a sling, midway between pronation and supination, and, most important of all, care taken to preserve the movements of the fingers and thumb, while the wrist joint is kept rigid; in short, it shoidd be treated with the same care as that bestowed on the wrist after excision. It may also be necessary to make incisions to let out pus, and remove disintegrated bone, and scrape away the infiltrated tissues.

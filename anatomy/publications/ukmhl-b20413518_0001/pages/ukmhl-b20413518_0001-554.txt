Applied Anatomy: 540 entirely supply the left eye. Others believe that each centre presides over the corresponding half of each eye; this arrange- ment seems to receive most support both from pathological and anatomical research (Fig 117). Hypertrophy of the pituitary body may cause blindness by pressing on the optic chiasma and tracts, as in some fatal cases of acromegaly, where this body has occasionally been found much enlarged. Fig. 117. The Optic Nerves. Globe Globe The optic nerve is one of the excito-motor nerves of sneezing, as is sometimes shown upon sudden exposure of the eye to a bright light; in paralysis of tlie first division of the fifth, where the other excito-motor nerve of sneezing is paralysed (the nasal branch of the fifth), irritation of the nose does not produce sneezing, yet exposure to a bright light will. The optic nerves are very constantly affected both in cerebral and cerebellar tumours, the condition produced being double optic

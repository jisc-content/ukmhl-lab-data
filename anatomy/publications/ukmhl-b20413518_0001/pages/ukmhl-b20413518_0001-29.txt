That part of the clot next the lumen of the vessel is soft, amor- phous, and red, like red currant jelly {"â– 'passive dot"). In many of the cases examined this is, in all probability, only a post-mortem clot; but there is good reason for believing that it precedes the firm, laminated external clot, and is also formed in those cases where an aneurism is cured by pressure in a few hours. It is well to bear in mind, however, that unless great care be taken it is apt to be broken down and washed away, and then the appar- ently cured disease begins again. It is most difficult to induce coagulation in vessels near the heaft, on account of the difficulty in obtaining a temporary retardation of the blood current; it is specially difficult in fusiform aneurism of the arch of the aorta.

The Treatment is to pad the axilla, to throw the anterior fragment into its proper place, and then, by a compress behind, the detached fragment is pressed into apposition ; or the patient may be kept in bed, and the muscles displacing the parts relaxed by raising and abducting the arm. SHAFT OF HUMERUS. Fractures of the shaft of the humerus are usually transverse, but may be oblique from above, downwards, and outwards, when the brachialis anticus and biceps muscles in front, and the triceps behind, will cause a certain amount of displacement and shortening.

The shortening, how- ever, is not usually great, on account of the weight of the arm; the usual amount is about three-quarters of an inch. The usual causes are direct violence, indirect violence, as a fall on the elbow, or muscular action. Jf the fracture be transverse there may bo

Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 459 ill young persons, M-lien the bone unites, that this end of tlie radius will not grow to its iisual length, A\'hile the ulna grows normally, and therefore the hand will lie gradually jjushed to the radial side,' probably simulating a badly-treated Colt.es. This fracture must also be diagnosed from fracture of the lower end of both radius and ulna; in this case tliere is greater mobility, and the whole hand, with the lower ends of the radius and ulna, is carried straight backwards, and lies in a straight line with the fore-arm, and is not abducted, as in Colles's fracture. This injury more closely simulates dislocations of the wrist backwards. It must Fig. 92. Colles's Fractureâ€”Dorsal View. 11 Prominence caused by the Head of the Uhia. also be diagnosed from sprain of the wrist joint; in sprain the tender area is over the line of the joint, whereas in fracture it is some distance above the joint, l^ut the lower fragment, besides being displaced upwards and backwards, undergoes a r.jtation on Its transverse axis, whereby the carpal articular surface comes to have an inclination backwards instea.l of forwards, as in the normal bone; hence the difficulty in flexing, though extension IS easy. It is also slightly rotated on its antero-posterior axis whereby the outer (radial) side of the bone is more shortened

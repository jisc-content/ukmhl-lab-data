Applied Anatomy: 542 Results of Paralysis.—(1) Ptosis, drooping of the upper eyelid, because the levator is paralysed; (2) external squint, as there is nothiug to oppose the external rectus, which is supplied by the sixth nerve, and which is, therefore, not affected; (3) double vision, as the images are not thrown on corresponding parts of the two retiuaj; (4) dilatation of the pupil, as the sphincter is paralysed, and, further, it is insensible to light; (5) loss of accommodative power for near objects, as the sphincter pupilla?, ciliary muscle, and internal recti are paralysed; (6) immobility of the eye in all direc- tions; (7) giddiness will probably also be present, as the patient has a false idea of the relations of external objects to himself; (8) the globe is slightly more prominent, due to tlie action of the superior oblique (fourth nerve), which is not paralysed. Paralysis of the third often only aftects a part of the nerve—e.*/., ptosis, and a fixed dilated pupil are frequently met with, without other signs. The squint in this case is xKiralytic, and the movements of the squinting eye are extremely limited (in contra-distinction to con- comitant squint, where the squinting eye retains its full range of motion). It is also divergent, and tlie double images are therefore crossed—i.e., the image belonging to the right eye appears to be to the left of the other (Heteronymous squint); in otlier words, the right hand image belongs to the left eye, aud vice versa. This is ascertained, in a darkened room, by means of a candle held about eight or ten feet from the patient, and a strongly-coloured red glass placed in front of each eye successively, by means of which one can tell which of the two images belongs to each eye. As the paralysed eye cannot move upwards or downwards, as tlie candle is moved the height of the images will vary according as the candle is above or below the horizontal plane, and the position of the images Avill be understood by remembering that the lower part of the visual field corresponds to the upper part of tlie retina, and vice versa. The image formed by the squinting eye is fainter than that formed by the "-working" eye, and is called the false image; patients by-aiid-by learn to disregard this image, and thus get rid of the inconvenience arising from the double vision. To find out the worldiig eye, let the patient look steadily at the tip of one index linger placed about a foot in front of the eyes, and then screen each vyv, successively and watch the unscieened eye.

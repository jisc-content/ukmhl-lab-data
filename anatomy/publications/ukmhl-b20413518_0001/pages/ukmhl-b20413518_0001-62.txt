Applied A natoiiiy: 44 waysâ€”the bulk required is less, it is more agreeable to tlie patient, is more easily administered as it requii-es no special apparatus, and the patient is more easily put under. With ether a special appar- atus is required, as it must be administered nearly pure, the stage of stimulation is more protracted, its smell is less pleasant to the patient, and it irritates the respiratory tract much more than chloro- form; but it causes less cardiac depression, so that it should be always at hand to be used in cases where the pulse shows signs of failure, or where the heart is weak and fatty; but it is only to be used as an adjunct to cliloroform, and in special cases, when the patient may be put under by chloroform and kept under by ether, e.g., in mitral disease. It (ether) must be avoided in cases of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other pulmonary affections, as it causes so much irritation of the bronchial mucous mem- brane, and its subsequent risks are much greater than chloroform; it should not be given to chUdren, nor used in cases where the operation is conducted by the aid of artificial light, as the vapour of ether is inflammable. It should not be used in operations about the mouth, as it causes a profuse secretion of ropy mucus : it is said to be safer than chloroform, but this is still an open question. A towel folded in the form of a A is all that is required for the administration of chloroform; folded thus, and tightly applied to the chin and side of face, it allows the administrator to see the patient's face, and watch the respirations, as well as to obsen'e changes in colour, and further, allows a free admixture of atmospheric air. It is not so wasteful as at first sight it seems to be, because the vapour of chloroform is heavier than atmospheric air, and hence falls down toAvards the patient's nostrils. It is found that 3 to 4 per cent, of chloroform, along Avith 97 or 96 per cent, of air, is the proper proportion to use. The objection to Skinner's inhaler is that one cannot easily feel Avhether the patient is breathuig or not: this could be obviated to a certain extent by leaving an opening in the flannel and inserting a valve of some delicate and easily movable material. The objection to Allis's inhaler is the gutta- percha forming its investing framework: I believe that the volatile gases given off by this material (especially wlien new), and inhaled by the patient, are a frequent cause of persistent vomiting after

Applied Anatomy: 474 Diagnosis—rractures of the neck must be distinguished (1) from bacl<ward dislocations. In dislocation we have marked imeisiim (except in the rare form of the everted dorsal), the rigidity of the limb in certain directions, the absence of resistance when the lingers are pressed into the upper part of Scarpa's triangle, the presence of the head of the bone in an abnormal position, and other signs of dislocation; specially note, therefore, the marked deformity and rigidity of the articulation. Sometimes, however, there is inversion in fracture of the neck, some say as a residt of muscvdar action—the adductors, because the external rotators are torn ofe or paralysed by the injury—but it is more likely due to impaction in that special position, from the attitude of the limb at the time of the injury, or from the direction of the force. But m any case there will be the usual feeling of resistance in the grom; and, as the head of the bone is in its proper place, the Surgeon wiU be able to obtain passive movement freely in all directions, and there will probably be broadening of the great trochanter. It must also be distinguished (2) from the condition of the hip, met with in chronic rheumatic arthritis, where the appearance and symptoms closely resemble those met with in fracture. There is pain, loss of power, and rigidity, especially on passive rotation, shortening of the limb, and elevation of the great trochanter; but in this condition there is no history of injury to account tor it, though, of course, a person suffering from chronic rheuma ic arthritis may also be the subject of fracture of the neck of the femur, when the diagnosis becomes very difficult. In chronic rheumatic arthritis it may be possible to detect enlargement _ of the lips of the articular bones, and creakmg dunng passive movement.

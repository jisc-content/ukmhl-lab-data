502 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTER X.XVJ. EXCISION OF BONES. THE UPPER JAW. The iipper jaw articulates with nine bones—viz., the frontal, the ethmoid, the nasal, the malar, the lachrymal, the inferior turbinated, the palate, the vomer, and, lastly, with its fellow of the opposite side. This bone assists in the formation of three cflViY^cs—the roof of the mouth, the floor and outer wall of the nasal fossa?, and the floor of the orbit; it also helps to form two fosm, the zygomatic and the spheno-maxilkry—and isso fi^mres, the spheno-maxillary and the pterygo-maxUlary. A knowledge of these facts has a most important bearing in the matter of diagnosis. In the case of malig- nant disease, the bone must only be removed, provided the Surgeon convinces himself that he can remove all the diseased tissue and, at the same time, cut wide of the disease. In examining a tumour of the upper jaw, the Surgeon must look at it from five points of view—(1) From the face, (2) from the orbit, (3) from the nose, (4) from the mouth and pharynx, and (5) from the temporal and zycromatic regions, and then ask himself the questions-(l) mere did it begin? and (2) What are its attachments now? Should it implicate the basi-sphenoid, the frontal or ethmoid cells, as shown by seimvation and divergence of the eyes, and broadening of tho root of the nose, it will be better to leave it alone. Among the early si-ns of malignant tumour of the upper jaw may be noted- (1) Ove°rflow of tears from pressure on the nasal duct; (2) shooting pains in the supra-orbital region from implication of the Wth nerve: and (3) blocking of the nostrils. As in all operations about the mouth, h^-morrhage is one of the chief dinicultios and dangers not merely from the actual loss of blood, but Irom the dangei of asphyxia from tlie blood passing into the pharynx; another veiy

Surg^ical, Medical, and Operative, 557 CHAPTER XXVIII. THE EAR. EXTERNAL AUDITORY MEATUS. This canal is about an inch and a quarter in length; the lower wall is the longest on account of the oblique direction of the mem- brana tympani, which forms an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon in the adult. In the child, however, the membrane is more nearly horizontal, forming only an angle of ten degrees with the horizon J but as age advances this gradually increases. The meatus passes obliquely forwards and inwards, and is curved upon itself, the concavity pointing downwards, so that its floor is convex; it is also curved a Little forwards. Its shape is oval, with the long axis vertical, and it is narrowest about the middle, and, therefore, the ear speculum should not be introduced beyond this point. Rather less than one-half its length is formed of cartilage, the rest of bone. In young children, however, there is practically no bony part, and in them, therefore, the meatus is very short. In examin- ing the membrana tympani, by means of the speculum and mirror, the pinna or auricle, should be pulled upwards and backwards in order to straighten the meatus as much as possible. In health, the membrana tympani is transparent, smooth and shining, and has a slate-blue colour, or delicate bluish grey, and it is concave from the outside; from its transparency it is possible to see serous collections in the middle ear through it. Besides seeing the membrane we also see the handle and short process of the malleus (which are situated between the outer and middle layers of the membrane) and that appearance known to aural surgeons as the " triangle of light," with its apex at the end of the handle of the malleus, an appearance due to the peculiar curvature of the membrane, the rays from the two sides crossing each otlier at the anterior and lower

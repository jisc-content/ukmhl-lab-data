Applied Anatomy 456 tips of the fingers; the anterior one must roach from the elbow to the roots of the fingers, and have a portion removed, if necessary, at the outer side of the lower end to avoid pressure on the hall of the thumb. Before applying the anterior splint the elbow jouit should be bent to a right angle, otherwise this splint is apt to be carried too for up, and when the arm is bent afterwards the end of tlie splint presses injuriously in the flexure of the jonit and may cause gangrene. They must be well padded as usual, but in addition a small "graduated compress"-hke pad is to be placed lengthwise in front and behind, so that it may press the nniscles of the fore-arm into the interosseous space and tend, at least, to keep the bones from faUing together.

The arm must then be slung in a position midway between pronation and supination-the thumb uppermost and pointing towards the patient's face. Over all an externa rectangular splint extending from the shoulder ^^^^T ly^r tips of the fingers should be applied to insure perfect innnobihtj of the broken ends, by fixing the elbow, wrist, and finger joints.

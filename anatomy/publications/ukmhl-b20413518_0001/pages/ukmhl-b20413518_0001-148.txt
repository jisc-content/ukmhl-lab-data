130 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTEK X. ARTERIES OF THE ABDOMEN. The Abdominal Aorta.-This vessel has been tied several tunes immediately above its point of bifurcation, or between that point and the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery, but without suc- cess- all the patients having died within periods varying from a lew hou; to ten days, the greater number having died .ithin t^vent^ four hours. It is usually tied behind the peritoneum, although Sir AsTLEY CooPEK, who was the first to tie the vessel, made his incision through the peritoneum. Aneurism usually occurs near the cceliac axis, or at the bifurcation j the genito-crural, antenoi crural, and external cutaneous nerves may be pressed upon, gmn rise t; pain in the course of the nerves. The aneurism must be diagnosed from a mass of f^ces in the transverse colon, lordosis pushinc. the artery forwards, from masses of enlarged glajids and ^MomLl tunJrs over the aorta. Origin.

78 Applied A iiatomy: the artery, with its accompanying veins, can be readily exposed. The vessel may also be exposed by a transverse or vertical incision, and is most easily reached in the second space. In cases, however, of htemorrhage from the artery, the result of a wound, the operation of securing the vessel may be more difficult, but tbe bleeding may be readily controlled by compression, as in the case of an intercostal artery; a small bag of muslin or a fine silk handkerchief, being introduced through the wound, is stuffed Avith lint or a piece of sponge, and then withdrawn so as to effectually compress the vesse against the costal cartilages (Fig. 15).

When the hankerchief is puUed outwards, In the direction of the aiTow, the round hall presses ou the artery and stops the bleeding. OF THE SECOND PART.â€”The superior intercostal artery, and arising in common with it is the profunda cervicis branch, which passes backwards between the neck of the first rib and the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, and ascends in the neck between the complexus and the semi-spinalis colli, supplying these muscles and anastomosing with the vertebral and prlnceps cervicis branch of the occipital artery. On the left side as already men- tioned, the superior intercostal arises from the first part of the subclavian. In either case it descends into the thorax in front of the neck of the first rib, and gives off the posterior intercostal arteries to the first and second spaces, anastomosing with the first aortic intercostal and the internal mammary. Tlie inosculation between the profunda and the princejjs cervicis is an important agent in re-establishing the circulation after ligature of the common carotid.

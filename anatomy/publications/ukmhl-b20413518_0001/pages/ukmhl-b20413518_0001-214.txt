196 Applied Anatomy: It should be observed that the phalangeal joints are concave, the concavity pointing towards the tips of the fingers; but that the metacarpo-phalangeal joints are convex toM'ards the tips of the fingers. 1st Method—By Single Palmar Flap (Fig. 35, E).—The hand should be emptied of blood by elevation, and an elastic tourniquet applied just above the wrist. It must then be held at a convenient height for the operator by an assistant, who flexes the elbow of the arm to be operated upon, places the fore-arm between his own left side and left arm, flexes the wrist, and places the hand in the prone position; tlie fingers on each side of the affected one are to be well abducted and turned in towards the palm. The operator should Fig. 36. Bent Finger.

He next grasps the tip of the phalanx to be removed between his forefinger and thumb, and bends it to a riglit angle with the second phalanx, and then by a transverse sweep of the bistoury, from heel to point, opens the joint, which is concave towards the tip of the finger. The usual rule for finding the joint is a good one—the joint is on a level Avith an imaginary line drawn

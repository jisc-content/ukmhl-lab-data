440 Applied Anatomy: no displacement, only a slight angling. If fractured at a point between the insertion of the deltoid below, and the muscles in the bicipital groove above, the lower fragment will be drawn upwards by the deltoid, biceps, and triceps, and glide to the outer side of the U'pper fragment, which will be drawn towards the chest by the muscles in the bicipital groo-ve—pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major (Fig. 82). Fracture below the Deltoid impression.—The upper fragment is abducted by the deltoid and supra-spinatus, while the lower Fig. 83. Fracture below the Deltoid.

Means to Command Haemorrhage during tlie operatiou, as — (rt) Thumbs of a trustwortliy assistant, e.g., or the femoral artery as it lies on the ilio-pectineal eminence at the pelvic brim, in amputation of hip; the thumb of an assistant, or a padded key (a strip of lint is to be wrapped round the ring of the key, which is then used to compress the artery, Avhile the other end is avcU padded to prevent it injuring the assistant's hand), or Spence's special compressor, to compress the subclavian against the first rib in amputation or excision of the shoulder joint. (/^) Lister's liloodless plan, of first emptying the limb of blood by simply elevating it for about a minute, with or without rubbing, in the direction of the venous flow, and then applying Esmarch's elastic band or Petit's tourniquet without the pad. In using this method there must be no circidar compression of the limb; the leg, for example, is to be held vertically by the assistant placing one hand on the heel and the other on the patella: in this way the floAV through the veins is not in any way impeded. Lister has shown that, by simple elevation not only is the outflow through the veins increased, by the action of gi-avity, but that the inflow is dimi- nished, on account of the contraction of the arterial Avails. Pctit's tourniquet with the pad alone, as it was formerly used, compresses both the main artery and the smaller vessels very eftectually. One disadvantage is that it also arrests the flow of blood in the super- ficial veins, which are thus soon filled, and bleed a good deal during the early stages of the operation; and hence, therefore, the tourniquet should not be tightened until the operation is about to be commenced, (r) Esmarch's bloodless plan.—He applies a

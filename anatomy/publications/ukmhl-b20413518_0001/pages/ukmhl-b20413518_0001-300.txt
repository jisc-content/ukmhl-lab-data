The Thigh.—In all amputations througli the thigli tlie amount of iiap length, allowed sliould never be less than twice tlie diameter of the limb at the point where the bone is sawn, and, if possible, the anterior iiap should be longer than the posterior. THE LOWER THIRD. 1. Spence's Method (1856), by long anterior flap (see page 186). —An assistant, seated in front of the patient on a low stool, holds the hmb firmly below the knee, so that the thigh shall be horizontal and projecting from the buttock over the edge of the table; another assistant takes his place opposite the Surgeon. The Surgeon stands on the right side of the limb to be ampu- tated. Mr Spence, however, directs him to stand on the left side, so as to command the bone whilst he is sawing. He then measures, with his eye, the breadth of one-half the circum- ference of the thigh, and inserts his knife into the side of the limb furthest from himself, well towards the posterior part, and about three inches nearer the trunk than the patella, carries the incision downwards to a point on a level with or below the lower edge of the patella, sweeps across the front of the knee with a gentle curve, and then straight upwards, and ends at a point exactly opposite to that at which lie commenced, the assistant standing opposite him, retracting the skin and fascia all the while. The leg is still kept in the extended position, and the Surgeon dissects up the flap from ofi' the patella, taking care not to button-hole it, and, on reaching the upper border of that bone, lie cuts deeply and obliquely upwards, so as to take up the

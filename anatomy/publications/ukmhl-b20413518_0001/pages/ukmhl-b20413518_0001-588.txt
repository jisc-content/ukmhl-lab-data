Erosion of large vessels, as the junction of the lateral sinus and internal jugular vein {sinus or gulf of the internal jugular) or the internal carotid artery. 11. Spontaneous Perforation of the Mastoid Process under soft tissues, and the formation of a pneumatocele or tumour containing air, the air of course coming from the jiharynx up the Eustachian tube to the middle ear, and then through the mastoid cells. It is loiowu by its soft feel, is probably reducible, can be increased in size by forcing air up the Eustachian tube, and is resonant on percussion. 12. Disease of the Temporo-Maxillary Articulation, leading to ankylosis more or less complete, and consequent inability to open the mouth. This is more likely to happen in children on account of the presence of the suture between the auditory process and the squamosa- zygomatic portion of the temporal bone. 13. Suppuration of the Upper Cervical Glands.—AVhen the deep glands are affected, and if at the same time there is a suspicion of mastoid disease, it may be a matter of considerable difficulty to make out the cause of the constitutional disturbance, for the symptoius may strongly suggest intra-cranial mischief. MASTOID DISEASE. IMastoid disease resembles other bone diseases, being either a periostitis and superficial ostitis, or else deep ostitis. In the first there will be great pain, tenderness to pressure, redness and swelling over the bone, as it is couiparatively superficial—the swelling making tlie auricle stand out from the head; in the second form there will also be great pain, but no ST^'elling nor red- ness, though there may be tenderness on tapping or deep pressure. In both the great danger is iiyannia, as in all bone disease where

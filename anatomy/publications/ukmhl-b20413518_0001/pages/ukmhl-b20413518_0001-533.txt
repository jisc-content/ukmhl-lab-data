Cavernous Sinus and Sphenoidal Fissure (foramen lacerum anterii(s).—The cavernous sinuses are situated at the sides of the body of the sphenoid bone, and are so named from their present- ing a reticulated or cavernous structure. Each sinus begins at the sphenoidal fissure, receiving the ophthalmic vein, and ends at the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal bone by dividing into the superior and inferior petrosals; they are connected by means of the circular sinus, and sometimes also by the transverse sinus. On the inner Avail of each sinus is found the internal carotid artery, Fig. 112. Right Cavernous Sinus. Third Nerve, r'ourth Nerve. First Division of Fifth Nerve. Venous Channel. surrounded by the carotid plexus, and Avith the sixth nerve to its outer side. On the outer wall are the third, fourth, and first division of the fifth nerve, in that order from above downwards (Fig. 112). Through the centre of this sinus the blood flows in an irregular channel lined by endothelium. Pressure on the sinus will be indicated by venous engorgement of the eyeball and orbital cavity, and paralysis of some of the ocular nerves, especially the third and fourth. The pressure may bo produced by anything that causes enlargement of the tip of the temporo-,sphenoidal lobe of the cerebrum, as a gumma or an abscess; also by aneurism of the internal carotid in the sinus. In the sphenoidal flssure the position of parts is considerably altered — (1) The fourth nerve to the inner side; (2) the frontal branch of the fifth ; and (.3) the lachrymal branch of the fifth. These three nerves are above all

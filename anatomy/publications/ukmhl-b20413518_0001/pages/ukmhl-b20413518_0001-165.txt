Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 147 Collateral Circulation (see Fig. 24).—1. The deep epigastric branch (9) anastomosing vvitli the terminal branches of the internal mammary (5) and aortic intercostals (2). 2. The deep circumflex iliac branch (20), and the ilio-lumbar branch (11) from the internal iliac, anastomosing with the lower intercostals (2), and lumbar branches of the aorta (6). 3. The gluteal artery (12) from the internal iliac, anastomosing with the external circumflex branch (27) of the profunda femoris. 4. The sciatic artery (19) from the internal iliac, anastomosing with the internal circumflex branch of the profunda (26). 5. The obturator artery (23) from the internal ihac, anastomosing with the internal circumflex branch of the profunda (26). HESUME of Abernethy's method:— 1. Use the curved incision as already explained. 2. Divide the external oblique in the direction of its fibres, with the ilio-hypogastric and the ilio-inguinal nerves. 3. Divide the other two muscles to the full extent of the external incision, and secure the branch of tlie deep external circumflex. 4. Open the transversalis fascia at the loicer part of tlie wound in the same way that tlie sheath of an artery should be opened, and enlarge on director or tear with fingers, taking care not to injure the peritoneum in any way, especially by tearing a hole in it. 5. EoU the patient over towards the sound side, and use broad copper spatulse to keep the edges of the wound apart. 6. Note the relation of the vein to the artery: also the genito-crural nerve lying on it, which must be carefully turned aside. 7. Pass over the psoas and not below it, and tear through the thin fascia prolonged from its inner edge over the vessel. 8. .Scratch through tlie loose cellular sheath with the point of the finger and aneurism needle; thread the needle, pass it from the vein, and tie.

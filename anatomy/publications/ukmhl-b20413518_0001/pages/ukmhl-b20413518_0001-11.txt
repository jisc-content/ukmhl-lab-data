PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION. IN preparing this Edition much new matter has been added, and the book rendered more complete in every respect, especially in the parts treating of Medical Anatomy. I trust the time is not far distant when a book such as this will be used by every Medical Student hefore he has left the dissuctiiig-rooin, for there is nothing in it—excluding the n\ere details of Operative Surgery—that he could not get vip much better, and more easily, during the time he is preparing for his Anatomical and Physiological examination: for Anatomy is but the handmaid of Surgery—but the dry b(jncs, hito which Siu'gcry br'eathes the breath of life. W(.'re such a course pursued, th(^ examination iu Surgery, instead of behig the bugbear it is to so many Students, would become the easiest and most satisfactory part of tlic vvh(jlc examination. A largo luunbcr of new Illustrations have been added, the phitcs of which have been engraved partly by Miss E. P. Hill Purton and partly by Mr David L. Turnbull, to both of whom I now desire to express my thanks.

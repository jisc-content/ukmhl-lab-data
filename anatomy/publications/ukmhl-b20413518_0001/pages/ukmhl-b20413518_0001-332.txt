314 Applied A nntoviy: in Is side of and above tlie coracoid process, and carry it dowiiwan and a little outwards tliroiigli the anterior part of the deltoid, immediately external to the cephalic vein, which must not be injured, and the humeral branch of the thoracic axis, for about four inches, down to, but not through, the insertion of the pectoralis major. The incision must go right down to the capsule By this incision (1) the integumentary structures and (2) the deltoid are divided; before going further, secure the anterior circumflex and the bleeding points with Wells's forceps. Draw aside the edges of the wound with blunt hooks or copper spatulae, feel for the bicipital groove, and then make a longitudinal incision through the periosteum and capside, along the inner side of the groove to the glenoid cavity. The long tendon of the biceps, if healthy, may then be raised from its bed and drawn to the outer side. The assistant then rotates the humerus forcibly outwards, while the Surgeon separates the tendon of the subscapularis and periosteum from the head of the bone with a periosteum elevator. The long tendon of the biceps is now to be shifted to the inner side and then the assistant rotates the humerus inwards and allows it to fall over the edge of the table, when the Surgeon separates the periosteum and muscles attached to the greater tuberosityâ€”the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, and teres mmor- in the same way that he separated the tendon of the subscapularis In cases of disease, where the tissues are much condensed, a small cross incision may lie made in the deltoid, just under the acromion process in order to expose the great tuberosity fidly. The assistant next forces the head of the bone up into the Avound, by drawing back the elbow and pushing upwards, when the Surgeon separates the posterior part of the capsule with the periosteum elevator, ov .livides it with a bistoury, keeping in mind the near presence ot the posterior circumflex artery and the circumflex nerve, and care- fully preserving them from injury ; the Surgeon himself then lakes the arm from the assistant, pushes the head of bone out of tin. wound while the assistant draws the soft parts well aside, an.l saws tJie bone by a I'.utcheu's saw, with reversed blade, throng J the surgical neck. In cases where the head of the bone is sev from the shaft by injury or disease, it must be seized with a 1 on forceps and carefully dissected out. As this operation is usualli

238 Applied Anatomy: especially near the tarso-metatarsal articulation 3 but lower down it need not be kept so close, as it is better to remove most of the short muscles of the toe and the sesamoid bones (HexVTh). The bone is then freed behmd by dividing the lateral ligaments on the inner side of the tarso-metatarsal joint, and next by inserting the point of the knife perpendicularly, with its edge directed upwards and backwards, to divide the strong inter- osseous ligament; and after this the metatarsal bone and toe are dra^vn forcibly inwards, the anterior end freed completely, and the toe removed. Or the anterior end of the toe may be cleared fii'st, and then its tarso-metatarsal end, by first dividing the strong interosseous ligament between the heads of the first and second metatarsal bones and the anterior extremity of the toe, and the metatarsal bone cleared completely by sweepmg the knife under the bone from without inwards. The toe is then forcibly drawn away from the others, and the point of the knife passed between the metatarsal bones, with its edge directed upwards (/.e., towards the anterior aspect of the leg), and the ligaments of the tarso-metatarsal articulation divided close to the metatarsal bone of the great toe, against which tlie edge of the knife is to be directed, lest the communicating branch of the dorsalis pedis artery, as it passes down to complete the plantar arch, be injured. In cases of ipwrtiaX excisum of he metatarsal bone and toe the communicating branch from the dorsalis pedis is apt to be looimded, and gives rise then to very serious and troublesome haemorrhage,, as it is exceedingly dihcult to secure the vessel. In such circumstances Mr SrENCE advises complete removal of the bone, Avhen there will be no difficulty m seeing and tying the artery. The straight part of the "racket-shaped" incision may be made on the lateral aspect of the foot, the disadvantage being that the scar is apt to be irritated by the pressure of the boot The method of removing the great toe and metatarsal bone as abo e described, by the "oval" method, is not so rapid perhaps a tic method of lateral flap by transfixion, l^"\l-ti'''VÂ°""'"tWl Xe tage of avoiding any scar in the sole. _ In the nie hod, the Sm-geon sei.es the soft tissues on the inner side of the foot .ArU his left hand and pulls them well inwards, and transfixes opposite

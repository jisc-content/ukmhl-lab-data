400 Applied Anatomy: posterior crucial ligament. The key to the position is to remember that the internal cartilage embraces both ends of the external, and that the anterior crucial is placed Utween the two anterior ends, but the posterior is behind both the posterior ends. Fig. 76. Head of Left Tibia. Tmnsverae Ligament. External Semi-lunar Cai-tilage, Postei'ior Crucial Ijigamout Anterior Crucial Ligament. Internal Semi-lunar Cai-tUage. Tlie Movements of this joint are in some respects peculiar:â€” 1. It is not a pure hinge-joint, but has in addition a gliding and rolling movement. In these movements the semi-lunar cartilages (which may be regarded as inter-articular fibro-cartilages) form movable and accurately fitting wedges. It is of great practical importance to keep this gliding movement in mind in the case of distortion of the joint due to strumous arthritis; in this disease the joint becomes markedlv flexed, the tibia lying against the posterior part of the condyles having glided backwards. For this reason forcible straightening can do no good, unless in recent cases, as it wiU not restore the bones to their normal position, the tibia retaining its backward displacement, even after the leg is straightened. 2. The movement is through an oblique plane, the axis of the femur is downwards and inwards, but when the lec. is flexed it is parallel with the thigh. 3. There is a move- ment of rotation at the completion of extension which is ca led the "lockiu"" or "screwing home" of the joint. 4. W Hen the knee is partly flexed, the joint admits of internal and external otation. Another point worthy of notice is the movemen s of the patella on the articular surface of the femur. ^ - ^ ment partly of gliding and partly of co-aptation. The patella has Ten facets on its aiticular surface-three pairs, and one internal

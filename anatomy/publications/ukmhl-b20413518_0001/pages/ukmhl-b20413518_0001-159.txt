The artery is next found between the two layers of the triangular ligament, and finally pierces the anterior layer, half-an-inch from the pubic arch, and ends by dividing into the artery to the corpus cavernosum and the dorsal artery of the penis. Its branches are—(1) Inferior hajniorr- hoidal; (2) superficial perineal; (3) transverse perineal; (4) artery tn the bulb; (5) artery to the corpus cavernosum; (6) dorsal artery of the penis. It will be noticed that this artery or its branches arc involved in many surgical operations, as—operations on the penis, perineal lithotomy, operations about the anus, lower part of rectum, and ischio-rectal fossa. The position of these three vessels may be indicated on the surface thus:—"If a line is drawn from the posterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the tuberosity of the ischium, the gluteal artery issues from the pelvis at a point about an inch external to the junction of the upper and middle thirds of tliis line; the ischiatic and pudic arteries a couple of inches lower down" (Chiene).

Applied Anatomy: 220 much consequence in the arm; and by making the flaps antero- posterior, associated groups of muscles are kept in separate flaps. The usual instruments are required, viz.:—An amputating knife, a saw, artery forceps, ligatures, and hone forceps. An assistant holds the arm at right angles to the trunk and rotated well out- wards. The brachial artery may be secured by the fingers of another assistant or by an elastic tourniquet; or, if the amputation is high up, the axillary may be compressed against the neck of the scapula by the fingers of an assistant, or by an elastic band; or, lastly, the subclavian may be compressed against the first rib by the thumbs, or a padded key. The brachial artery and the large nerves may be left in the flap the operator deems most convenient, usually the anterior, or at the inner angle of the two flaps; the only point is to take care not to transfix them, and to sever the vessel transversely at last. The Surgeon is to stand within the arm in amputating on the left side, but on the outer side for the right arm. He next grasps the anterior muscles with his left hand, and holds them well forward, and then enters the knife with its point directed a little upwards {i.e., the point will be on a higher plane than the handle, which is to be slightly depressed), so as to secure a broad- based flap, passes it as closely in front of the bone as possible, and then, by slightly raising the handle, makes the point emerge at a spot'exactly opposite to that at which it entered. The knife is then carried downwards longitudinally for some distance by a slight sawing movement, so as to form a well-rounded flap from two and a half to three inches in length—the sldn being cut, if possible, longer than the muscles; for this purpose the knife must be gradually turned towards the surface, but should be brought out sharply at last, so as to cut the vessels, nerves, and skin transversely. An assistant now lightly supports the flap, not retracting it at all, and the knife is then entered half-an-inch below the former point of transfixion, to avoid cross-cutting with the heel, and carried belnnd the bone and made to emerge on the other side at the same incision, and a posterior flap cut of the same length and shape as the anterior. The assistant now retracts both flaps forcibly, and the bone is raised almost perpendicularly and cleared by circular sweeps of the knife for about an inch and a half above the angles of the incision; and, linally, the periosteum is divided by a sweep of the

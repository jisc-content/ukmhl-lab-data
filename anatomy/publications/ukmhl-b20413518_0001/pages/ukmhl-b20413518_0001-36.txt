Applicd A natomy : 16 A distinction is sometimes drawn between the methods of Brasdor and AVardrop. Brasdor's operation is ligature of the main trunk heyond the aneurism, e.ry., the common carotid in aneurism at its lower part (Fig. 5); whereas Wardrop's operation is ligature of one or both of the main branches, e.g., the common carotid, or the subclavian, or both, in innominate aneurism (Fig. 6).

COMPRESSION. —This may be applied, either to the aneurism directly, or to the main artery on tlie proximal side of the aneurism :—(a) Direct pressure {i.e., on the aneurism itself) is a method not often used, and is objectionable in many ways— (1) It is apt to cause sloughing and possible rupture of the sac. (2) If this method be worth retaining, and if it be used as a means of cure the pressure to be efficient must, to a great extent, emptj^ the sac of blood and keep it so, in the very nature of things; but if this is the case, then the chief factor in the formation of the blood

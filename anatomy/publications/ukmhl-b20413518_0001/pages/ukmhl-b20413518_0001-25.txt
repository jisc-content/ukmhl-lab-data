5 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. of tlie arterial wall; or, in other Avords, whatever increases the blood pressure on tlie one hand, or reduces the resisting force of the arterial walls on the otlier, as thinning of their coats or diminished resiliency. It is specially apt to OCCUr—(1) In large vessels, because atheroma (the chief predisposing cause) is a disease of the large arteries; (2) in places subjected to great strain, e.g., the axillary artery in sailors, probably from climbing, hanging by their arms, etc.; (3) where large arteries bend or bifurcate, because the pressure is greatest at these points, e.g., the innominate, bifurcation of the common carotid, and popliteal, (a) Predisposing Causes.— Anything that gives rise to a local wealaiess of the vessel wall. The great predisposing cause is atheroma, but syphilis, gout, rheu- matism, Bright's disease of the kidney (especially the granular contracted form), abuse of alcohol, intemperance, and vice of every form, are also important predisposing causes; and all the more so because many of these conditions are accompanied with hypertrophy of the left ventricle, so that not only is the vessel wall weakened but the blood pressure is increased as well. All occupations where sudden and severe efforts are required irregularly, as in soldiers, sailors, and huntsmen. It is said to be most common between the ages of thirty and forty, {h) Exciting Causes.—Wounds or blows, sudden strains, irregular vascular excitement, as from violent exer- cise or emotion, fits.of anger, etc., in people of a certain age, say above fifty. Symptoms of Aneurism.—The more important symptoms are— (1) The presence of a pulsating tumour near the known course of some blood vessel, and which cannot be separated, or moved apart, from the vessel. (2) Pressure on the artery above arrests the pulsa- tions of the tumour, and may cause it to subside, but when the pressure is removed it refdls again, often with a tlii'ill; pressure on the artery below will cause it to become larger and more tense. (3) The pulsation is expansile, the tumour enlarging in all its diameters at each .systole, and is not a mere tlirnst forwards. One may determine whotlier tlic pulsation is expansile or not in two ways—(«) j;y placing a finger on each side of the swelling and observing wliethcr tliey are separated or simply raised ; or {h) by fixing a piece of strapping, or elastic webbing, with a slit in its middle over the swelling, when, if the pulsation be expansile, the

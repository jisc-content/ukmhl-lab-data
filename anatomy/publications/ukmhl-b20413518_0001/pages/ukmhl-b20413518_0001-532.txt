518 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTER XXYII. THE EYE. THE ORBIT. The cavity of tlie orlait resembles a four-sided pyramid, tlie antero- posterior diameter of which, is slightly greater than either the vertical or transverse. Its apex is formed by the optic foramen; the base is snrrounded by the frontal, malar, and superior maxillary bones. The roof is formed by the frontal bone and lesser wing of the sphenoid; the roof is very thin, and sharp-pointed bodies may easily pass through it accidentally, or be forced through with homicidal intent, and injure the brain. The floor is formed by the orbital plate of the superior maxilla, the malar bone, and the orbital surface of the palate bone. On the inner wall we find the nasal process of the superior maxilla, the lachrymal bone, the OS planum of the ethmoid, and the body of the sphenoid. The outer wall is formed by the malar bone and the great wmg of the sphenoid. The openings into the orbit are nine in number:â€” (1) The optic foramen, which transmits the optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery; (2) sphenoidal fissure (for structures passing through, see after); (3) spheno-maxillary fissure, which transmits the superior maxillary nerve with its orbital branch, the infra- orbital artery, and the ascending branches from Meckel's ganghon. This fissure opens a communication between three fossie and the orbital cavity-the temporal, zygomatic, and sphcno-maxillary. it will therefore be readily understood ho^v malignant growths can so easily and rapidly spread in both directions-..;/., the rapid y .rrowin- forms of sarcomata, which are the tumours most ft-equentlj met with in this situation. (4) Supra-orbital foramen, lor supra- orbital vessels and nerves; (5) infra-orbital canal, for "^^^^^1^'^ vessels and nerve; (0) anterior ethmoidal foramen, for nasal nene

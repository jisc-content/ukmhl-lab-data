148 Applied Anatomy. Beware of too free disturbance of the extra-peritoneal cellular tissue, and use strict antiseptic precautions throughout the operation. With but slight variations this resumt'. is applicable to ligature of the common and internal, as -vvell as to the external iliac. RESUME of Cooper's operation :— 1. Make an incision three inches long with its centre over the vessel, and about half-an-inch above Poupart's ligament. 2. Secure superficial epigastric artery, and divide the tendon of the external oblique, the whole length of the skui wound. 3. Scratch through the cremaster muscle and push the cord upwards and inwards, displacing or dividing the internal oblique and transversalis muscles as far as may be necessary. 4. ^Tow hook the parts well aside by blunt hooks, or retractors, or copper spatulse—the inner one pulls the cord, the internal oblique and the deep epigastric artery upwards and inwards, the outer one pulls the internal oblique and transversalis upwards and out- Avards. 5. Next, with the fingers make an opening in the trans- versalis fascia over the vessel by tearing it through from Poupart's ligament; this structure may be regarded in the same light as the femoral sheath, and it is therefore unnecessary to divide it the ic^iole length of the external wound. Purther, when divided in this way the peritoneum is less likely to be injured. G. Clear the vessel in the usual way at a point about n inch above Poupart's ligament, in order to avoid i two large branches. The needle must be passed from the veil, which lies on its inner side. Take care o: the deep circumflex iliac vein which is seen crossing the artery, and tlie genito-crural nerve which lies upon the vessel.

The upper third of the radius is pretty deeply covered though its Uad is quite superficial, just imme diately below the external condyle of the humerus; in the lower two thu'ds It IS quite subcutaneous on its outer aspect. However f ractures of this bone are best detected by noting whether the head of he bone follows the movements of the wrist during pronation and supmation, the Surgeon placing his left thumb on the head 01 tne radius. The Olecranon Process.-Fractures of the olecranon are usually the result of direct violence, and may be divided into-(l) Those yth cUsplacement, and (2) those without. The latter variety is the more common. Of the latter there are three forms-(a) L tr^^erse, where the periosteum and ligaments are intact and e^ectually resist the action of the triceps to separate the fragments; Ik rand^rr - longitudinally, o^almost' stellate and (.) where the tip is broken otf obliquely from behind f '^^^^"S the unbroken posterior!^ " a tached to the tnceps.

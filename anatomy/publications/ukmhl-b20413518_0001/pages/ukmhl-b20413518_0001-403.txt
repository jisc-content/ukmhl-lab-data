Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 385 CHAPTER XXII. DISLOCATIONS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY. The Hip Joint. —Cfoss, Diarthrosis; Sub-Class, Enartlirosis. The Synovial Membrane covers the anatomical neck of the femur, lines the inner surface of the capsule, covers the cotyloid ligament, forms a tubular prolongation around the ligamentwn teres, and covers the mass of fat (Haversian gland) lying at the bottom of the acetabulum; it sometimes communicates with the bursa beneath the psoas and iliacus. The Bones entering into its formation are the acetabulum and head of the femur. The acetabulum is formed by all the three parts of the os innominatum —the ilium forming a little less than two-fifths, the ischium a little more than two-fifths, and the pubic bone the remaining fifth. These three pieces unite, through the Y-shaped epiphysis in the acetabulum, about puberty. The acetabulum consists of a horse-shoe-shaped articular surface, which is deficient opposite the cotyloid notch, and a central non-articular depression continuous with the notch. The strongest and deepest part of the cavity is at its upper and posterior part, the lower and inner part being very shallow and weak. The Arteries of the joint come from the obturator, sciatic, internal and external circumflex, and the gluteal arteries; the nerves are derived from the sacral plexus, great sciatic, obturator, and accessory obturator nerves. Ligaments.—1. The Cutijloid, a tire of white fibro-cartilage, attached to the rim of the acetabulum and transverse ligament; it deepens the cavity, closely embracing the head of the femur. 2. The transverse, bridges over the notch, converting it into a foramen, and is continuous at each end with the ligamentum teres; beneath it tlic nutrient vessels pass into the joint. 3. The 2b

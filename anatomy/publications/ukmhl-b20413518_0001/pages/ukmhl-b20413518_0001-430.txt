414 Applied Anatomy: If backwards and inwards, tlie symptoms are reversed.- The ligaments conuecting the astragalus with the os calcis and scaphoid are more or less completely ruptured; the malleoli are often fractured, and the lateral ligaments of the ankle joint more or less torn. Laterally.—These are usually incomplete and often compound; they are more common than the antero-posterior forms. In the 'Inward form the appearance resembles that of tallies vcwms—the foot is inverted, its inner border is raised, shortened, and rendered concave, while its outer border is lengthened and convex. The head of the astragalus and outer maUeolus form a marked projection on the outer side of the foot; the inner maUeolus is bm-ied, and the whole limb seems shorter than natural. In the outwcml form the reverse holds true. The appearance resembles that of ialii^s valgus; the foot is everted, its outer border is raised, shortened, and concave, while the inner is lengthened and convex. The outer maUeolus is buried, while the tibia and head of the astragalus form a marked projection on the inner side. The Treatment must be conducted on the same pruiciples as in dislocations of the astragalus.

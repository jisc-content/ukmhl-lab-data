Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 431 when the support is removed. Tlie Treatment is to raise the elbow, place a pad in the axilla, and bind the arm to the side. Fracture through the Surgical Neck, that is, of the glenoid cavity, and passing through the supra-scapular notch, and internal therefore to the root of the coracoid process. As the powerful coraco-clavicular ligament is not ruptured, there can be no displace- ment, as the broken fragment is slung to the clavicle; hence there Avill be crepitus, but no deformity. One can only diagnose this condition by a process of exclusion (Chiene). AU that is required in the way of Treatment is to place the fore-arm across the chest and bind the whole arm firmly to the side. Fracture of the Acromion Process.—Many of the cases of sup- posed fracture of this process are believed to have been instances of non-imion of its epiphyseal centres, which appear, one at fifteen, Fig. 77. Epiphysis of Acromion Process. -Articular Surfiico lor Clavicle. Unites from 22 to 25 years of age. and the other at sixteen years, and unite sometime between twenty- two and twenty-five years of age (Fig. 77). The cause is usually direct violence, as a blow on the tip of the shoulder, or it may resu t from the head of the humerus being forced upwards from a fall on the elbow. It is necessarily associated with dislocation of the acromio-clavicular articulation. The broken fragment is drawn downM-ards by the deltoid, though the strong periosteum and the trapezius oppose the tendency to great deformity; the arm feels as It it were dropping off, and is, therefore, supported by the other Jiand. Ihe patient can neither raise nor abduct the arm. As the bone IS subcutaneoiLs, by running the finger along the spine of he scapula, the fracture may be readily detected, and, by raisincr the arm the deformity is removed, probably with the productioi° ot crepitus, ihe Treatment is to support the elbow in a sling and tlx the arm to the side.

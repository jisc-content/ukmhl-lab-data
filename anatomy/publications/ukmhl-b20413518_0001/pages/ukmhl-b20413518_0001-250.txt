232 Applied Anatomy: The large vessels aud nerves will be found in the inner flap, and consist of the axillary vessels and the cords of the brachial plexus; in addition to these the cephalic vein and the anterior and posterior circumflex arteries are divided at some stage of the operation, as well as the humeral branch of the acromio-thoracic. The capsular and coraco-humeral ligaments and the costo-coracoid membrane are also cut through. Amputation of the Scapula and Arm—In amputations higher than the shoulder joint, as for large tumours of the scapula, e.g., enchondroma, sarcoma, etc., the chief points to be attended to are—(1) To divide the clavicle, (2) to divide the muscles attached to the coracoid process (biceps, coraco - brachialis, and pectoralis minor), and then (3) to tie the subclavian, and afterwards proceed to free the scapula, securing the supra-scapular, posterior scapular, and subscapular arteries as soon as possible. The wounded surface is very large, and it is important, therefore, to observe strict anti- septic precautions. The flaps are dorsal and pectoral, semi-lunar in shape, with the convexity directed forwards. The x>osterior begins over the superior border of the scapula, passes down over the acromion process to the lower border of the axilla, and then back to the inferior angle of the scapida; the cmt&rior is begim over the clavicle, an inch internal to the coracoid process and carried down over the front of the axilla to its lower border, passing slightly towards the sternum, so as to render its anterior margin somewhat convex. For the chief Structures divided in this operation, see "Excision of the Scapula;" only in amputation of the whole upper extremity the muscles and ligaments connecting the scapula and humerus directly are not divided, while the sub- clavian (or upper part of the axiUary), the posterior scapular, and the supra-scapular vessels are divided, as well as the chief branches of the axillary, especially the subscapular and the long thoracic; the pectoralis major is also divided. RESUME of amputations of the Upper Extremity:—In finishing the section on amputations of the upper extremity, I would add a few words to guide the student through the mazes of the very bewildering array of " methods " and " modifications of methods " adopted by various Surgeons,

233 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. T]ie following are the methods I would advise on the livincf body:— THE HAND. 1. A Terminal Phalanx.—A long anterior flap, or antero- posterior semi-lunar flaps. 2. The Second Phalanges.—As the terminal; save as much of it as possible, and do not remove tlie entire finger, at the carpo- metacarpal articulation, except in cases of extensive disorganisation from whitlow. 3. A Whole Finger.—For the second and third fingers, Professor Chiene's method, leaving the heads of the metacarpal bones. For the iiidex and little fingers, the " oval" method, the straight part of the incision being made in the dorsal aspect of the hand, the inner part of the oval being longer than the outer, and cut off the projecting rorner of the metacarpal bones obliquely, but not including the entire breadth of the head. 4. The Thumb.—Adopt the method by which you can save most, be it regular or irregular. THE ARM. As a general rule, anywhere between the hand and the shoulder, the modified circular, i.e., two equal semi-lunar skin flaps, with circular division of the muscles, may be adopted with advantage; the skin flaps may be taken from any side, and need not neces- sarily be equal in length, as this would often necessitate a higher amputation than really necessary, especially in cases of smash. Cut the flaps so that their amiljlned length, will give suflicient covering, and so as to leave the longest possible stump, the position of the scar being of less importance in the upper exti'emity, provided it is mobile. 1. The Wrist.—The modified circular as performed by the late Professor Si>enck, or by the long palmar flap, so as to take a covering from tlio, hard ti.ssue of the heel of the liand. 2. Lower Third of Fore-arm —i\Iodinc(l cii'cular, or i)ure cu'culai'.

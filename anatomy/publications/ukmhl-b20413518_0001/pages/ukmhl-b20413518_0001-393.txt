The radiiis, from its relation to the hand, receives the shock in the first instance, but part of this is passed on to the ulna through the interosseous membrane, and hence both bones are driven backwards • this is no doubt assisted by the very strong connection between the upper end of the radius and the ulna. Acute Synovitis of the Elbow.—When the joint is disteialcd n-iih fluid, the swelling first shows itself in the hollows at the sides of the olecranon process, especially on the outer side, filling them up and rising up under the tendon of the triceps, and surrounding the head of the radius ; so that instead of having two hollows and a prominence between, as in the normal condition, we find two lateral swellings separated by a depression which corresponds to the tendon of the triceps and the olecranon process. The joint is held semi-flexed, at about an angle of one iiundred and twenty degrees, and the fore-arm semi-pronated, as in this position the joint is able to contain most fluid, from a general relaxation of all tlie ligaments. Enlargement of the bursa over the olecranon process is to be distinguished from the swelling caused by synovitis, by the fact that the swelling is over the middle line of the joint, obscuring the olecranon both to sight and touch, and not at the sides of that process, as in synovitis. This form of bursitis is often known as " Student's Elbow," from the supposition that students, in the pursuit after book-knowledge, like St Anthony, rest their elbows upon the table or desk, and place their hands over their ears so as rigidly to exclude all external sounds. It is more appropriately termed " Miner's Elbow." The strength of this joint is mainly due to bones; but this bony strength varies with the position of the joint. In Extetmon, for example, the coronoid process loses its grasp to a great extent, and it is easy to produce dislocation backwards in this position; but the olecranon process in the same position is advantageously placed and powerfully oi)poscs forward displacements. On the other hand, in Flexion, the olecranon process loses its antero-posterior grasp, and it is easy to produce forward displacements; but in this position the coronoid process is most firmly locked and opposes backward dislocation. To i)ut it shortly—in full Flcrinn the olecranon process has a

Extent. —From tlio loAver border of the first rib to the lower border of tlic insertion of the teres major. Course.-—With tiie arm well abducted, its course is indicated by a line drawn from a point somewhat to the sternal side of the middle of the clavicle to the inner border of the coraco-brachialis muscle, near its insertion into the humerus. It is divided into three parts—a part above, a part beneath, and a part below the pectoralis minor. Compare this artery with the subclavian: both arc divided into three parts—in both the first and second parts are deeply placed, and in both the third part is the one usually ligatured, and in both cases as near the termination as possible to escape the branches. THE FIRST PART.—This part extends from the lower border of the first rib to the upper border of the pectoralis minor. Position of the Arm.—Tlie shoulder should be pushed well upAvavds, and allowed to fall backwards as far as possible, as this will raise the clavicle and increase the space; the arm, at the same time, being well abducted, and the head inclined to the opposite side. When the superficial structures and the pectoralis jnajor are divided, then the arm must be brought close to the side to relax the pectorals and allow them to be displaced downwards by an assistant. With the arm in the position indicated, the operator, standing on the outer side of the corresponding arm, makes an incision parallel with the clavicle, or with a slight convexity dowuAvards, from a point half-an-incli external to the sterno-clavicular articulation, to a point half-an-inch internal to the coracoid process. It is better not to go quite up tu tliG coracoid process in order to avoid cutting the cephalic vein as it lies in the groove between the pectoralis major and the deltoid.

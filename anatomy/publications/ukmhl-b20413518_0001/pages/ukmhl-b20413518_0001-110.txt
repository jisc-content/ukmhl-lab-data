92 Applied Anatomy: The characters of a sphygmographic tracing areâ€”(1) A sloping upstroke, due to the delay of the pulse wave; (2) diminished volume of wave; (3) impairment of percussion, from the diminution in th.e force of the wave; (4) obliteration of secondary waves; (5) inequality of the pressure employed on the two sides; (6) some- times vibratile waves, corresponding to the thrill sometimes felt by the finger. A constant dissimilarity in the pulse tracings of the two radials is the most valuable sign, and this is best of aU demonstrated by sphygmographic tracings; the wave is delayed, it is smaller than the other, and there is loss of tension. The presence of the signs above enumerated in the pulse at both wrists would point to an aneurism of the ascending arch; if the riglit pulse be affected more than the left, the aneurism must involve the innominate; if the left more than the right, the aneurism is of the transverse arch beyond the innominate.

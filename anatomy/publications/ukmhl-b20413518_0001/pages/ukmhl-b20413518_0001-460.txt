4,40 Applied Anatomy: in a sliiK^ Begin passive movement very early, within seven days (Hamilton), in case tlie joint be stiffened either hy fibrous adhesions, union of the detached parts in wrong positions, or e se by the excessive production of callus adhering to the articular surfaces. Another way (which is suitable in all cases of injury about the elbow joint except fracture of the olecranon) is to bend the arm to an acute angle, place a pad in the bend, and retain i thus by a figure-of-eight bandage, and afterwards to sling or bmd the arm to the side (Spence). NERVE LESIONS. Nerve Injuries following fractures of the humerus.â€”lu fractures of the shaft of the humerus, the musculo-spiral nerve may be iniured, either directly, at the time of the accident, or latei-^ by the "ensheathing callus." Lower down, at the external condy e, the posterior interosseous branch alone may be injured, it the trunk Of the musculo-spiral be injured, supination , : extension of the hand and fingers is entirely lost, and he hand becomes pronated, and "wrist drop," somewhat resembhng that seen in lead palsy, ensues; extension of the elbow will probably be impaired, or altogether lost. As the biceps, paralysed, a certain amount of supination is still possible. Fmthe he lumhricales and the Merossd are not paralysed, so that the pper two joints of the fingers, if forcibly bent, may be ag^ extended, as these muscles are supplied by the median and the ^ilr ne ves, and their function is to flex the first phalanx and .tend the o her two; the fingers are flexed, and cover the thum wh ch is also flexed and adducted. It is to be W^^" lead-poisoning by the history of the case-occupation bli^ hue on .ums (from the sulphide of lead), cohc, tremblmg of the muscles ;rvio;s to their actual paralysis, and by the ^^^^ Lll-marked character of the "reaction of degeneration, ^^ojn w the continuous current.

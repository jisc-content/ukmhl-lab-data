Injury, as bad compound dislocations, fractures into joints, more especially gun-sliot injuries of the head of the humerus, bones of the elbow joint, and head of femur. 2. For Disease of various kinds—(«) To remote the dimu8ed part in cases where amputation is not justifiable, as in some cases of hip joint disease, and disease of the temporo-maxillary articulation; {h) to save life where the patient is being exhausted by the discharge and pain, and unless relieved will probably die; and {<■) merely to expedite recovery and save the patient months or years of suffering. 3. For the Results of Disease or Injury, as in osseous ankylosis of the elbow, or of the knee joint in a' bad position. II. The Objects aimed at are—1. Complete removal of the diseased part. 2. To leave a useful limb—in the upper extremity, by securing mobility; in the lower, by procuring ankylosis, in order to give a firm basis of support. This is subject to occasional variation to suit the special occupation of the individual—e.y., a house-painter requiring his arm fixed in tlic straight position,'ol' a turner rc.iuiiing his knee fixed at a i^ight angle so as to allow him to work the treadle (Buya.nt). III. Excision versm Incision.—In ca.ses where there is no evidence of disease of the bone, but the joint is full of pus, then a free incision and drainage is the proper course; this relieves tension and may cure the disease, but may leave a stiff joint, .-sometimes incision and scraping or clipping away the gelatinised Hynovial membrane and other soft tissues, scraping carious cavities and surfaces with a sliarp spoon, tliorougli washin- with a solution of bicldoi i.le „f mercury and insulllation of u

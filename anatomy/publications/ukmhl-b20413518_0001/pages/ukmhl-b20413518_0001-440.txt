Applied Anatomy: 424 cellular tissue. Further, deformity may be absent in transverse fracture, and in cases where there are two hones side by side and only one is broken. Crepitus is absent in impacted and green-stick fractures, and obscure in diastasis. The indications for Treatment are—1. To remedy the dis- tortion as completely and as gently as possible; this is the most important part of the whole treatment. 2. To keep the fractured ends steady and in good position by the use of means that will command the joint above and below the fracture; in most cases, however, this will not be enough, notably in the case of the humerus, Avhere the muscles that move the wrist and fingers take their origin from the lower end of that bone, and it is necessary, therefore, to command all the muscles, from origin to insertion, that are in any way attached to the broken bone, in order to avoid the risk of non- union. 3. In special cases, where the fracture is near a joint and surrounded by tendons, great care must be taken by judiciously early passive movement to avoid adhesion and stillening of the tendons—e.^., in Colles's fracture of the wrist and in Pott's fracture of the ankle. This is specially important also in fractures near the elbow in young persons, with or without separation of the epiphysis, lest new bone be thrown out and render the joint stiff. In every case the splints ought to be looked to on the second day, lest the blood extravasation and serous oozing cause so much swelling of the limb that the splints become too tight and produce gangrene.

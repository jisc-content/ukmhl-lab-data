Applicd A natomy: 486 THE PATELLA. This is merely a sesamoid hone developed in the tendon of the quadriceps extensor. It has one centre which appears about the second year, and is fully ossiHed about puberty. There are two varieties of fractureâ€”(1) Transverse; (2) stellate, Y-shaped, or some other form, but not transverse. It may be broken by direct violence when the knee is flexed, and the fracture may then be comminuted, transverse, vertical, stellate, etc. The usual cause of fracture, however, is muscular action, as when the patient slips backwards, and, to save himself from falling, throws the quadriceps suddenly into action, when the patella snaps in the same way that a stick is broken across the knee; the patient falls down hecause the patella is broken; it is not the fall that breaks it. The fmcture resulting from muscular action is always transverse, and m all pro- babiUty always into the knee joint and also into the prepatellar bursa, unless the fracture merely involves the peak below the arti- cular surface. For this reason the joint swells up from the effusion of blood into it, which, however, usually subsides after a few days rest AVhen due to direct violence, the fracture is very often starred or vertical, and then bony union, it is said, is common enoucrh, as the aponeurotic covering is not ruptured; but when due to muscular action, the fragments are often widely separated on account of rupture of the fibrous expansion at the sides of the bone, and the union is usually by fibrous tissue only Treatment.-At first, in almost all cases, as there is severe inflammation and great eftusion into the joint rest m the easiest position, and evaporating lotions are indicated, or removal o the fluid by antiseptic aspiration. Whatever method of treatine^it adopted, the patient must be semi-recumbent in all cases, .Mth the foot raised to relax the muscles that displace the ^W^r fragment-- the quadriceps extensor, but especially that P^Y'/V T down the rectus femoris; after this, the fragment may be ^-^-f^^^ bv some special appliance.

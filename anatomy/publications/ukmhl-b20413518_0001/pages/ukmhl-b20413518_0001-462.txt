Applied Anatomy: 448 in the disease known as " progressive muscular atrophy;" in this disease all the fingers are equally affected, but in paralysis of the ulnar, the ring and the little fingers are much more hent than the others, since the first two lumbrical muscles, which are supplied by a branch of the median nerve, escape. In traumatic cases of lesion of the ulnar nerve, the onset is sudden, not progressive, and the paralysis precedes the atrophy. Sensation is lost in the little finger and on the uhiar side of the ring finger; the paralysed muscles undergo rapid atrophy, and show the " reaction of degeneration." The atrophy is first and most clearly seen in the ahductor indicis (first dorsal interosseous), and next in the short muscles of the little finger.* In addition to these symptoms we have the usual trophic lesions of the skin and its appendages—glossy skin, loss of hair and nails, blebs, and chilblain-like ulcerations. The muscles paralysed are—(1) The flexor carpi ulnaris; (2) half of the flexor profundus digitonun ; (3) the three short muscles of the little finger—abductor, flexor brevis, and the opponens minimi digiti; (4) one and a half muscles of the thumb—the abductor pollicis, and deep head of the flexor brevis; (5) all the palmar and dorsal interossei; and (6) the two inner lumbricales. To treat these conditions, mechanical means must be used so as to prevent further deformity and remove that abeady existing, passive motion, massage, and galvanism to the paralysed muscles. In cases where the nerve is actually enveloped in bony outgrowths, it wiU be necessary to cut down and set it free. The musculo-spiral nerve may also be paralysed, partiaUy at least, in those who use crutches f" crutch palsy") from pressure of the upper end of the crutch upon the nerve trunk: also by the axillary pad, in cases of fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus: sometimes also in coachmen, who fall asleep on the box with the reins twisted round the upper arm: and lastly, in those who have imbibed too much of the cup that cheers (1) and most certainly does inebriate, and have fallen asleep in consequence, with one arm hanging over the back of a chair, in that position of good-natured abandon and free-and-easy carelessness so characteristic a result of the too free imbibition of this beverage.

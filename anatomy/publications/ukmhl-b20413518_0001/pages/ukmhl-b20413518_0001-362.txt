Applied Anatomy: 344 to a riglit angle, and adducted till the inner side of tlie knee corre- sponds to the middle line of tlie body; the saw is then to he held parallel to the surface of the table." There are two objections to sa\nng the femur through the highest part of the trochlear surface, as is usually recommended—(1) The section will usually be above the broadest part of the condyles, and more especially during the growing period of youth; and (2) in young persons the lower ej)iphysis will be entirely removed—tliis epiphysis does not unite with the shaft till attaining twenty years of age. But is it necessary to go so higli'? It may in some cases, AAdiere the disease has spread a considerable distance from the articular surface; but, as a rule, in proper cases the section may be made through the broadest part of the condyles, and any remaining cartilage pared off with the knife or removed from the trochlea by Butcher's saw, cutting round the bone, or else by the bone forceps. The operation of clearing the bones must be conducted very carefully, keeping the edge of the knife close to the bone, on account of the proximity of the large popliteal artery and its articular branches, especiallj'' in cases of pathological distortion. The Siqoerior Internal Articular passes round the femur, above the internal condyle and under the tendon of the adductor magnus, and the Superior External A rtictdar passes round immediately above the outer condyle; the Inferior Internal passes below the internal tuberosity of tlie tibia, between the bone and the internal lateral ligament of the joint, and the Inferior External passes above the head of the fibula, but beneath the external lateral ligament and the tendon of the biceps. The Azijgos Articular enters the joint by piercing the ligament of WiNSLOW. The Patella, if much diseased, should be removed ; if only slightly, it should be denuded, as in Gritti's amputation; if healthy, it may be left. As a rule, it ought to be removed, as it is of no use, since it does not keep the bones together; it may further interfere with drainage in tlie early stages, and disease may break out anew in it afterwards. Tlie Arteries likely to be divided in this operation are those taking part in the general anastomoses around, or in the joint, viz.:—The live articular branches of the popliteal already mentioned, together with branches from the anastomotica magna of the femoral, and the recurrent articular

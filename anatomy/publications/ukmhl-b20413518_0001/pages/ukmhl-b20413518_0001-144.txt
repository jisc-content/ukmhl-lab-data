126 Applied Anatomy: branches to anastomose with the branch of the anterior mterosseoiis artery, found on the posterior surface of the fore-arm. The Deep Palmar Arch communicates withâ€”(1) The anterior interosseous and anterior carpal arch; (2) digital branches of the superficial arch; (3) with branches of the posterior carpal arch. It will be seen,\herefore, that the various vessels about the wrist and palm anastomose with great freedom. i i -ui i If both the radial and ulnar arteries are ligatured, the blood reaches the palm from the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries through the anterior and posterior carpal arches, which communicate with the deep palmar arch. There is usually a small artery accompanying the median nerve into the palm comes medianV), but this branch is sometimes of large size, and joms the Fig. 21. The Graduated Compress. The Compress. .

Hence it is not advisable to tie the radial and uhiar arteries for wounds of the palmar arches, as the blood will still reach the wound. It is better to apply a graduated compress or plug (ing. .1), together with acute flexion of the wrist and elbow join s, as we wish, as far as possible, to avoid an extensive wound of the palm, on a count of the resulting cicatrix.

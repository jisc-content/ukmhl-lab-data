Applicd A natoniy: 150 is tlien indicated by a line drawn from a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis, to the inner side of the internal condyle of the femur, or to the " adductor tubercle." The artery at first lies immediately over the head of the femur, but as it passes downwards it takes an oblique course along the inner side of that bone, and finally passes behind it as it enters the popliteal space through the opening in the adductor ma^nus. In applying pressure, therefore, to the femoral artery m the° upper part of its course we ought to press directly backwards aaainst the hody of the puhes, or the ilio - pectineal eminence (Fio-. 27), but, if applied to the middle third of the thigh, as the artery Ues in Hunter's canal, the pressure must be directed out- wards towards the femur.

Note that the « common femoral" of Surgeons is the femoral arteiT before it has given off its profunda branch, and is usually about one inch and a half in length; below this point it is known as the superfidal femoraV But the common femoml and the superficial femoral of Surgeons form simply the femoral ot Anatomists; while the " deep femoral" of Surgeons, is the prof unda branch of Anatomists. Relations—The axtery is divided into a superficial and a deep T.art The superficial part is contained in Scarpa's triangle, and ^responds, in extent, with upper third of the t^gl^i the deep par is contained in Hunter's canal, and corresponds with t^^e middk third of the thigh.

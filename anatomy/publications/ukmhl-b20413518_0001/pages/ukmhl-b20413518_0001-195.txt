Surgiaxl, Medical, and Operative. 17i facts nuist be duly Aveighed for the [jaticnt's sake â€”for it is not a question of mere operative dexterity. First, see that tlie vessel is more than ivoundcd, make sure it is completely divided; if this is not sufficient, then Second, use a graduated compress properly applied, combined with elevation of the limb; if even yet it does not stop, probably the best plan is Third, to tie the superficial femoral at the " seat of election," i.e., the apex of Scarpa's triangle. This, at first sight, may seem too serious for the occasion, but it is not really so. The ligature of the superficial femoral is not surely such a serious thing as ligature of at least three vessels below the calf, probably more, and, after all, a considerable risk of failure j Avhile ligature of the single vessel in the thigh will almost certainly be sufficient. At the same time it should only be done when everything else has failed. Fourth, just as in the hand, the plantar arch may be ligatured directly from the dorsum of the foot after removal of a part of one or other of the metatarsal bones overlying the vessel (Delorme). An attempt might also be made to secure the bleeding point by forcipressure. jM

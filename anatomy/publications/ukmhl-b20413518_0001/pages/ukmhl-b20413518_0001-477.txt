Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 46S These must be distiiigiushed from dislocations 6l the wrist, by the fact that in dislocation the styloid processes maintain their proper relations to each other, but are altered with respect to the metacarpal bones, as well as other signs. Fracture of the Metacarpal Bones is usually caused by direct violence, as by striking a blow with, or faUing upon, the closed list; it is more often met with in men, and in them during the period of active adult Hfe, and usually towards the end of the week (pay-day), or about Christmas and the New Year. There are two varieties of this fracture—(1) The oblique, and (2) the transverse. In the oUique form there will very likely be shortening of the finger connected with the injured metacarpal, but in the transverse form there is no shortening. The fracture is to be diagnosed by running a finger along each metacarpal bone and carefully watching for any tender spot or marked deformity; this can easUy be managed, as the bones are so subcutaneous. We may also grasp the two ends of the bone and try for mobility in its continuity; then place the hands palm to palm, and observe if the corresponding finger of each hand is of the same length as its fellow, l^ext, we may press the end of each finger towards the wrist; this wiU cause pain at the fractured spot should such exist, but if it be merely a bruise there will be no pain felt at the injured spot. Lastly, make the patient clench his fists, and compare the line of the knuckles in the two hands, noting any fulness or depression. It should be noted that a "stave " of the thumb may produce a contusion of the meta- carpo-phalangeal joint or split tlie head of the metacarpal bone f racture of the metacarpal bone of the thumb usually presents no difficulty m diagnosis, as it is free on all sides ; the metacarpal bones of the index and little fingers are more difficult, and those ot the middle and ring fingers the most difficult of all, on account of their relation to the other liones. Treatment.-First Method, to be used in the case of transverse fracture of tlie meta.'arpal bones of the middle and rinr^ fin-ers L)irect the patient to grasp a ball of soft worsted in the°palm of the injured hand, and bandage it in that position thus:—Cai-ry an ordinary bandage in a figure-of-eight, beginning at the carpo-meta- carpal articulation of the thumb, over the back of the fist, and then round the front uf the second phalanges of the fingers, but not

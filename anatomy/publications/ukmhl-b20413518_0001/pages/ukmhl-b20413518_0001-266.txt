Applied A natoiny : 248 operation completed by sawing off the projecting head of the astragahis and the articular surface of the os calcis. The ohjections to this operation are—1. If done for disease, it leaves two hones of all others tlie most likely to he diseased. 2. If for injury, it is better to dissect up a suihcient flap from the sole and saw the bones at the most convenient point, irrespective of articulations. 3. The muscles forming the tendo achiUis have nothing to counteract them and therefore draw up the heel, and the patient soon begins to walk on the front part of his stump, i.e., on the cicatrix, more especially in cases of amputation for disease. For this reason it is advisable, in cases where this amputation is performed, to divide the tendo achillis subcutane- ously at the same time, in order to equalise matters. The tendency to tilting, however, may be obviated, to a great extent, by stitching the extensor and flexor tendons together over the face of the stump. Stme's amputation at the ankle joint is to be preferred to either Hey or Chopart in the case of disease of the bones, and for Chopart in almost every condition. r r . RESUME of Chopart s amputation :— 1. Foot extended and bony guides felt by thumb and index finger. 2. Outline dorsal flap, beginning and ending a little in front of bony guides. 3. Eetract skin flap and then divide everything down to bones at base of flap. 4. Bend foot forcibly downwards and disarticulate. 5. Then peel off all the structures forming the sole, keeping the knife close to the bones, as far as the balls of the toes. 6. The flap is then fashioned and dressed, being cut longer on the inner side. Lateral incisions might be first made, as in Lisprano, and the whole operation com- pleted as there described (see resume of Lisfranc). In every case it is probably better to shape and raise the plantar flap by dissection, before disarticulation, both in Hey and Chopart.

159 Siirgica/, Medical, and Operative, RESUME of the operation at the " seat of election " :â€” 1. Make an incision three inches long in the line of the vessel, with its centre five inches from Ponpart's liga- ment, avoiding the trunk of the long saphena vein, and securing large tributaries. 2. Expose the edge of the sartorius and turn it outioards. 3. Turn aside the internal cutaneous and the long saphenous nerves, and the nerve to the vastus internus, and open the sheath common to artery and vein. 4. Then open the sheath proper to the artery, and clean well till the white external coat is seen. 5. Pass the needle unarmed from within outwards, thread, and withdraw. 6. Do not dip the point of the needle too much, but keep it close to the artery, so as to avoid wounding the vein. LIGATURE m HUNTER'S CANAL. This operation is rarely performed now-a-days, as the vessel is too deeply placed, and besides, ligature at the apex of Scarpa's triangle gives better results. " Hunter's canal" is formed by an aponeurotic expansion thrown across from the adductors longus and magnus on the inner side to the vastus internus on the outer side. Fig. 32.

It is triangular in shape, the base being formed by the expansion already alluded to, and it extends from the apex of Scarpa's triangle to the opening in the adductor magnus, and corresponds, therefore, with tlie middle tliird of tlie thigli. It enclo.ses the femoral artery and vein, and tlie long saphenous nerve

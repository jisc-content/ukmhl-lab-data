Stcrgical, Medical, and Operative. 3 Arterio-venous Aneurism is usually caused by a wouud which siraultaueously implicates an artery and some neighbouring vein; in some rare cases it may arise from disease. There are two varieties: â€” (1) Aneurismal varix (Kg. 1), where the wounded artery and vein have adhered closely, and the inflammatory exuda- tion, caused by the injury, has fixed them in this position, and Fig. 1. Aneurismal Varix. Vein. Artery. > The an-ows indicate the direction of the blood-stream. at each pulsation a jet of arterial blood is projected diredhj into the vein, dilating it and causing incompetence of its valves, and gradually leading to a varicose condition of the neighbouring veins, both superficial and deep. The veins become tortuous, thickened, and may pulsate, but there is nothing of the nature of an aneu- rism formed. (2) Varicose aneurism (Fig. 2), where the lymph cementing the two vessels yields and an aneurism is formed, Fig. 2. Varicose Aneurism. TIic Sac - Vein, di- lated and tortuous. Artery. The aiTowH indicate the dirccticjn of the bl(jod-strcam. the wall of which consists of the new inllammiitory material and condensed cellular tissue. The sac of the aneurism communicates with both tlie artery and vein, tlie blood being projected from the artery Uiroucih flie mc into the vein, dilating it as in aneurismal varix. By far the most frcf|uent cause of arterio-venous aneurism is the unskilful performance of venesection at the bend of the

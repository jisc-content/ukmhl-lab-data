30 Applied Anatomy: forceps till the white external coat of the vessel comes into view, the back of the knife in the meantime being directed towards the artery; the opening in the sheath should be about one quarter of an inch above, and one sixth of an inch below. Too free separa- tion of the sheath from the artery will endanger the vitality of the latter by the destruction of the vasa vasorum, which pass from the sheath to the coats of the artery; but, on the other hand, a small channel must he cleared thoroughly in order to pass the armed aneurism needle easily. 5 On no account lift the vessel from its bed, as to do so would endanger its vitality, by destroying the dehcate vasa vaso- rum and pave the way for sloughing of the vessel and secondary ht^morrha-e. The aneurism needle, with or without the hgature is passed through the aperture in the sheath and gently insmuated round the vessel till its point is just visible on the other side, and then the ligature is seized and drawn out by a pair of forceps, whi e the needle itself is gently withdrawn. The ha^idle of the needle must on no account be depressed, as this would raise the vessel from its bed; also great care must be taken not to slide the hgature lip and down the artery, as in both cases the vasa vasoi-um won d be destroyed. The vasa vasorum run for a little way m the sheath before entering the wall of the artery, and this probably explains why it is that in secondary haemorrhage the blood most frequently conies from the distal side of the ligature; and the l^^tter nutritive supply on the proximal side, explains why that end of the yesse is more firmly occluded than the distal end. The needle should be passed from the side where the chief danger exists, and this in large arteries, is usually the vein-a noteworthy exception to Sis nde is seen'in the case of the third part of the subclavian In cases where the artery is accompanied by two venis t^ should be passed from the side on which the nerve s placed Many text-books recommend that the needle should be passed unarmed, except in the case of deep-seated arteries, as the ^ac. it certainly passes more easily unarmed, but I do not thmk .he mi Potion is one of great importance.

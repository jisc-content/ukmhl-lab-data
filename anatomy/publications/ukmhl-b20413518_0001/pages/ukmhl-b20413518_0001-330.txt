Applied Anatomy: 312 CHAPTER XIX. SPECIAL EXCISIONS. SHOULDER. Excision of the Shoulder Joint.—Various forms of incisions liave been proposed—(a) A single longitudinal vertical incision; (h) a T-shaped incision; (c) a modification of this form, one half of the cross bar being omitted—somewhat lilce the letter L upside down : these two forms are chiefly used in cases where the soft parts are much infiltrated and non-resilient, and where, conse- quently, it is necessary to gain more room, which is done by making a short cross-cut at one or both sides of the longitudinal incision; and (d) the U-shaped deltoid flap operation. To check haemorrhage during the operation, an assistant may compress the subclavian by a padded key, or Esmarch's elastic tourniquet may be used. The elastic band is forcibly stretched, and applied round the shoulder, and as high up in the axilla as possible, so as to compress the artery against the neck of the scapula; the upper part of the turn should rest in the concavity at the outer end of the clavicle and internal to the coracoid process in front, and root of acromion process behind. To pre- vent its slipping during the operation, pieces of bandage should be iDlaced beneath it, both in front and behind, and held by an assistant at the opposite shoulder. Excision may be required for— 1. Disease—as caries of the head of the bone, simple and tubercular, disease of the cartilage, etc. In these cases the glenoid cavity is secondarily involved, and will recover without interference, when tlie head of the bone is removed. 2. Injurij—as compound and comminuted fractures, gun-shot wounds, etc. 3. Rcsvlts of Disease or Injury rarely demand excision of the shoulder. Many diseases .e^d in ankylosis, either true or false; but for tliis condition excision

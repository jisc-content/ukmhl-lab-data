79 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. CHAPTER yil. CAROTID ARTERIES. Common Carotid Artery.—Aneurism of this vessel presents as a pulsating tumour between the two heads of the sterno-mastoid, more or less elongated in the vertical direction, with a bruit propagated upwards, and not towards the axilla, and gives rise to special pressure sj/mptoms:—for instance, if the aneurism be situated near the bifurcation of the vessel (where it usually occurs), there is a constant hacking cough due to pressure on the superior laryngeal nerve; if it be placed lower down we may get spasm of the glottis from pressure on the recurrent laryngeal nerve. On account of the dense cervical fascia the aneurism tends to press inwards, and may simulate abscess of the tonsil or pharynx, but is more rounded and circumscribed than abscess, and the swelling Avill pulsate. There may also be serious dyspnoea and difficulty in deglutition from direct pressure, and also from irritation of the pharyngeal plexus. Aneurism of this vessel occurs earlier in life than most aneurisms, and as often in women as in men; it is most common on the right side and usually at the bifurcation, as at this point the pressure is greater than elsewhere. To compress this vessel during life one may—(1) squeeze it laterally by placing the thumb at the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and the next three fingers at the posterior edge: in this way the vagus escapes pressure; (2) directly backwards against the "carotid tubercle." In using this second method pressure must be made on a level with the cricoid cartilage (which corresponds to the level of the "carotid tubercle"), because if below this point the vertebral will be compressed as well. This is important, because wounds of the common carotid are very common in civil practice, and must be distinguislied from wounds of the vertebral, and rice versa.

The innominate bone is developed by eigbt centres — three primary and five secondary; the three j^rmary — one for the ilium, the ischium, and the pubes respectively—unite through the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum, about puberty; the secondary centres appear about puberty and unite about the twenty-fifth year (Fig. 94). The secondary centres are—one for Fig. 94. The Innominate Bone.

It is important to reinm- ber the Y-shaped piece, as before its consolidation, pus, m hip jomt disease, may readily pass through into the pelvis.

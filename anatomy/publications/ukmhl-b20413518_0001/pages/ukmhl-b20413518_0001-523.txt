In tearing the bone from its posterior attachments, the vertical plate of the palate bone, l)terygoid fossa, and internal pterygoid muscle, are usually torn away as Avell. 4. Arteries—(«) Branches of the temporal—(1) Orbital; (2) middle temporal; and (3) transverse facial. {!)

Raise the flap upwards and outwards, and agaiu sccui'c bleeding points. •5. Separate the soft from the liai'd palate by a transverse incision; don't botlier about tlie soft covering of tlic hard palate. G. Xotch the palate process deeply with the saw, and tljcn do the same to the malar junction. 7. With a large bone forceps complete tlic division of the malar attachment, entirely divide the nasal, and com- plete the division of tlie palate process, at the same time giving the bone a prise outwards, using the bone forceps as a lever. 8. With tlic lion forceps M-rencli tlie bone suddenly and forcibly downwards and outwards. 9. Quickly plug the gap tlius made to control hjcinorrhagc, 10. Lastly, carefully stitch up the external Avound and lip. THE LOWER JAW (One-half), Tlie same principles must guide as in the last operation. If tlic tumour be a simple one, then keep close to it during the operation; but if, on the other hand, it is malignant, cut wide of it. The instruments required arc the same as in the previous operation; in r.u.scs where a pM,rt only .jf the bone is reniuvcd, a match, or

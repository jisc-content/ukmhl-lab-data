The present book is intended to replace a small book I published some years ago, but is to be regarded as essentially different in all respects. It is intended to be sufficient for the vai'ious Higher Examinations, as well as for those of less severity, and especially is it intended for those Examinations that require actual operations on the dead body as part of the Final or Tass J'xamination. The Lnnrel, in its kind and favourable review of my first book, dvcw attention to some points wherein it was deficientâ€”chiefly in relation to " Surface Anatomy."

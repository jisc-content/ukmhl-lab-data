80 Applied Anatomy: Origin.—On the riglit side in the bifurcation of the innominate artery opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation. On the left side it springs directly from the arch of the aorta. Extent. — From behind the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point a little higher than the upper margin of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides into internal and external carotids. Course.—Its course is in- dicated by a line drawn from the sterno-clavicular articulation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. The artery, together with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, are included in a common sheath derived from the deep cervical fascia, although each structure lies in a separate compart- ment; the septa are comparatively strong, especially that between Fig. 16.

Septum between the Arteiy and Vein. Internal Jugular Vein the vein and the artery. This is important, because the compart- ment containing the artery may be opened without interfering with those containing the vein and nerve, and in this way the vein, which is about twice the size of the artery, and often overlaps it, is prevented from bulging unduly over that vessel during the operation. In the sheath the artery is the most internal, the vein most external, and the nerve behind and between (Fig. 16). Before describing the operation itself, we wUl state very briefly the chief relations of the sheath to the surrounding parts. As high as the Cricoid Cartilage it is deeply placed, and is covered hy—0-) The common investments (i.e., skin and superficial

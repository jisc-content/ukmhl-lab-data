Applied Anatomy: 84 border of the sterno-mastoicl — the artery bisecting this angle. Draw the muscle inwards with a blunt hook, and then expose the sheath fully, by carefully turning aside any intervening structures with the handle of the knife, using the blade as little as possible, in order that the descendens noni nerve and its communications, and sterno-mastoid branches of the superior thyroid artery, be not injured. Open the inner compartment of the sheath well to the tracheal side, since the gi-eater part of the sheath, as thus exposed, is occupied, in the living body, by the internal jugular vein (see Fig. 16). Then clear the artery very thoroughly from the special areolar sheath surrounding it, till the white external coat comes into view, and pass the ligature (without using force) from the outer side to avoid the risk of wounding the internal jugular vein or including the vagus, holding the other edge of the opening in the sheath with a pair of artery forceps to steady it during the passage of the ligature. RESUME of the principal steps m this operation;— 1. Centre of the incision to be opposite the cricoid cartilage, not too far forward, lest the anterior jugular be cut. 2. Expose the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, and secure sterno-mastoid artery. 3. Expose the upper edge of the anterior belly of the omo- hyoid, watching for the venous plexus, sterno-mastoid artery, and descendens noni nerve. iN'ow flex the head, and, 4. With a finger in the wound, press towards the transverse processes of the vertebra3, and feel the artery in the angle between the omo-hyoid and the sterno-mastoid, rolling beneatli the finger. 5. Open the common sheath well to the inner side, and, if necessary, push the internal jugular outwards, or com- press it at the upper angle of the wound to empty it. 6. Open the special cellular tissue sheath of the artery, and clear it till the white external coat is seen, and then pass the needle from the outer side.

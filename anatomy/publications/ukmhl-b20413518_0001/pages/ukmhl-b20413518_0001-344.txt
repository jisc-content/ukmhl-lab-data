32G Applied Anatomy: rheumatic synovitis, leading to caries and destruction of the joints. Excision shortens the disease, and lessens the risk of long con- tinued suppuration, and so far as the operation is concerned the risks to the patient are almost nil. Principles—In former times the results of excision were any- thing but satisfactory, the usual result being either a recurrence of the disease, in cases of partial excision for carious disease; or a stife and useless hand, from extensive interference with the tendons encircling the joint, and imperfect after treatment. Of later years, however, it has been shown that complete excision may be per- formed and yet leave a useful hand, provided that—(1) all the diseased bones and cartilage-covered surfaces of the radius and ulna, and the bases of the metacarpal bones are removed ; (2) that aU the tendons concerned in the movements of the fingers and thumb are preserved uninjured; (3) that we can obtain firm fibrous ankylosis of the wrist; but even with firm bony ankylosis the result is good, because the movements of flexion and extension at the elbow make up for the loss of movement at the wrist; and (4) that we commence passive movement of all the joints of the fingers and thumb very soon after the operation. I Lister's Method.-The guides for this operation are—1. ihe tubercle on the middle of the dorsal surface of the radius, imme- diately to the ulnar side of which lies the tendon of the extensor secundi iiiternodii pollicis. 2. The tendon of the extensor secuiKb, passing from this tubercle, obliquely .to the root of the thumb, crossing the radial artery at a point nearly on a level with the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. To control hemorrhage and prevent oozing dunng the operation, the limb is first emptied of blood by -^'-^'^yf^'f^, and EsMARCH's elastic tourniquet applied about the middle of the fore-arm Any adhesions must be broken down, before begmnmg the operation, by forcible free movement of all the jomts, when 1 e p£t is' uiKler chloroform.

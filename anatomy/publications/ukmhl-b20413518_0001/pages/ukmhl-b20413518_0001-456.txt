442 Applied Anatomy: end to cavoid pressure uu tlie internal condyle. The arm must not be put across the chest, as in fracture of the clavicle, as this would bend the bone at the seat of fracture. It is important, however, in all cases to fix both the elbo^v and shoulder joints either by an external or internal rectangular splint or both, the external reaching to the tiig^ of the fincjarx, to command the muscles acting on the wrist and fingers, since | they mostly arise from the lower end of the humerus, and every I time the fingers are moved the fractured point is disturbed, ihc \ ne-lect of this precaution very often leads to an ununited fracture. Should an internal one be used, care must be taken not to press unduly on the axillary vein, or the internal condyle; a hollow pad must be placed over the internal condyle, or else a hole cut out of the splint. If an external one be used, it must l>e earned from the acromion process to the finger tips, and its upper part expanded in order to envelope and steady the shoulder. It is most convenient to make the rectangular splints of poroplastic In some books, great stress is laid on the fact that the elbow is to be supported in cases of fracture of the shaft of the humerus as otherwise, it is stated, non-union is apt to take place. But probably the real cause of non-union in most cases is, because the jomt on each side of the fracture, as well as the fore-arm and fingers, have not been thoroughly kept at rest. Fractures of the shaft unite m from four to six weeks, according to the age of the patient. FEACTURES NEAR THE ELBOW. Fracture just above the Condyles.-Thisfracture occurs chiefly in yormg porLns.

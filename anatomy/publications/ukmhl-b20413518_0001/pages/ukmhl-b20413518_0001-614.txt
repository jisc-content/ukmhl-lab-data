E. & S. Livingstone, Publishers, Price 4s. fkl. Notes on Pathology By J. EYLAND WHITAKER, Senior Demonstrator of Aftatomy in the School of Medicine, Edinburgh. Vol. I. —GBNEBAL. Vol. II. —SPECIAL (In preparation). ' The art of a clever teacher and that of a skilful printer have combined to render " Notes on Pathology," on the whole, an eminently serviceable little book to medical students, compelkd by a baneful tradition to waste time in Lecture Eooms that should be spent in Infirmary and Dispensary.'—txotsman. 'It is a presentable little volume, which medical students will find very useful.'—Scottish Leader. ' This is evidently the first part of what may be described as a useful synopsis for students, and it deals purely with General Pathology. The author has attempted to outline the causation and pathological characters of disease ; and in a neat, concise way every subject is dealt with so as to give a concentrated idea of the varieties of disease and the nature of their pathological processes. The arrangement of the book is in Sections—the first of which is devoted to Altered Conditions of the Circulation; another treats of Inflammation and its Results ; a third of Retrogressive and Progressive Changes; and the last of Parasites and Parasitic Diseases. As a digest it is a lemarkably good book, without padding or unnecessary verbiage, and with a comprehensive siin'ey of causation and the varieties of allied or similar pathological processes. For the student it will prove an admirable memory help, and for the practitioner it will frequently be suflBcient whtu he does not require to dip exhaustively into a subject.'—Glasgoxo Herald.

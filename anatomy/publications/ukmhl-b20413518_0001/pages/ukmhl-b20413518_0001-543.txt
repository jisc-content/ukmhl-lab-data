S^irgtcal, Medicai, and Operative. 599 _ Symptoms.—Pulsation, displacement of the eyeball, and some- times loss of sight, from pressure optic neuritis; in the arterio- venous forms we have the usual thrill and bruits. Conditions present in some cases-Cirsoid aneurism, aneurism by anastomoses arterio-venous aneurism of the orbit, pulsatile dilatation of the vessels of the orbit-as in exophthalmic goitre, communication between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus aneurism of the internal carotid, tumours pressing upon the termination of the ophthalmic vein, thrombosis of the cavernous smus, dilatation of the carotid artery, aneurism of the ophthalmic in the cranium, and occasionally true aneurism. As re-ards the diagnosis-note (1) that ordinary aneurism and varicose "aneurism tend to grow larger, so also would pulsating malignant tumours: and (2) that aneurismal varix does not tend to increase in size _ The arterio-venous varieties are caused by wounds implicating simultaneously an artery and vein; the author has seen two such cases, one caused by a knitting-needle, the other by an umbrella wire. This fat in the orbit is often the seat of abscess, due either to a primary septic cellulitis, or from disease of the neighbouring, bones, especially strumous caries of the lachrymal or ethmoid; iii this condition there may be no redness of the skin as the abscess IS so deep, but there is usually oedema of the lid. At the inner angle of the orbit the facial and ophthalmic veins communicate and m cases of malignant facial carbuncle, the septic thrombosis readily extends along the facial vein and through the ophthalmic to the cavernous and other sinuses, speedily setting up a condition of septic embobsm and py^^mia. In young people also, soft rapidly growing sarcomatous tumours may start in the cellular tissue round about and behind the globe, from an injury, as a blow with a snowball. Ivory exostosis, and enostosis growing, in the frontal smus, are also sometimes found in the inner wall of the orbit, displacing the eyeball. Tumours of purely local origin pressing upon the optic nerve and displacing the eyeball, will cause uni-lateral optic neuritis {'^choked dUc"), followed by atrophy of the nerve pressed upon; in tumours of cerehral origin, tlie same appearances are usually found in hoik eyes. Between the packing of the cavity and the globe itself, however, we find a membranous sac, which is known as the rap.ule of Te„nu or the hmica rarpnalis r

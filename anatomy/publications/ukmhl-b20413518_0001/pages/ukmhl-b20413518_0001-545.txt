If the finger be placed on the inner edge of the orbit, tliis little tendon will be felt to tighten every time the eye is closed, and still more so if the eyelid be drawn outwards. In this way the tendon serves a most important purpose in helping to drain away the tears, as its pressure empties the lachrymal sac, and then, when it relaxes, the sac sucks up the tears through the canaliculi— resembling, in fact, an ordinary injection syringe. In opening an abscess of the lachrymal sac, the knife must be entered just below this tendon, and towards the outer side, to avoid the angular vessels. Fig. 116. The Lachrymal Apparatus. (From GiiAv's "Anatomy.") Nasal Duct.—This duct leads from tlie lachrymal sac to the inferior meatus of the nose. The edges of the canal through Avhich it i)asses may be felt on one's own person, by pressing the finger on the inner edge of the orbit on its lower aspect. To ]niss a probe through it, it sliould be directed downwards, outwards, and a little backwards (the direction of tlie duct). Obstruction of this duct leads to distension, and consequently to irritation

The clavicle is subcutaneous, and any irregularity therefore as m the case of fracture with displacement, is readily felt It is more frequently broken than any other single bone in the body although the radius almost runs it neck to neck, and it is more frequently the seat of grem-M fracture than any other bone Statistics show that one-half tlie total number of fractures of thi^ bone occur before the age of five years. Green-stick fracture is very often subperiosteal in children on account of the very thick k ep this fact m mind, as there may be little or no displacement, . and the incautious practitioner may state to the parents that there s no fracture.

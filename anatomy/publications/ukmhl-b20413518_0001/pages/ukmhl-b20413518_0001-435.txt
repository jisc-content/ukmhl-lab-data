Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 419 in the first iiistuuce, if tlie separation of tlic periosteum from the bone be not too long couHnued, tlie periosteum may fall down and become again connected Mdth tlie vessels in the compact tissue. (3) But still further, even though the vascular connections are torn, and the periosteum be separated from the bone for an indefinite period, still the bone may not necrose, because the vessels in the compact tissue are still filled with blood on account of the anastomosis between the vessels of the marrow and the "endosteum" with those in the compact tissue from the peri- osteum. (4) The question, too, of septicity has a very important bearing on this point â–  even though the periosteum be extensively stripped up, if the wound be kept free from septic micro-organisms it wiU very likely unite again without a trace of necrosis, but this cannot possibly occur shoidd the wound be septic. 3. The so-called "nutrient artery" passes into the interior of the bone and supplies the marrow and endosteum; it woidd be better therefore to call it the medullary artery. It reaches the interior through a distinct bony canal'which runs oljliquely through the sliaf t, near its middle; in the bones of the upper extremity the nutrient arteries are directed or run towards the elbow, while in the lower extremity they run frum the knee Another curious point is, that in young bones the epiphyses of tliat end towards which the nutrient artery runs, are the last to heym to ossify, but are t\iQ first to unite after they have beo-un- the lower end of the fibula, however, is an exception to this nilc' AVhcn the artery reaches the interior of the bone, it divides into ascending and descending branches, which, on the one hand anas- tomose with the vessels from the periosteum, and on the other with the articular vessels at the spongy ends, after the epiphyses have completely united. The Growth of New Bone.-By means of experiments witli madder, wliich, when mixed with the food of young animals, renders tlic bone produced during its administration of a deep red colour. It was shown by Dujia.mkl, that a coloured rln<, was pro- duced under the periosteum, a coloured layer under the epiphyseal cartdage, and coloured circles in tlie Haversian canals; at these points, therefore, new l,one is laid down. SvMii, in 1840, showed that If a sdver plate be inserted between the periosteum and the

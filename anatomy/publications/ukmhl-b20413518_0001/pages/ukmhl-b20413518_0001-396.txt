If the deformity is easily reduced, and if crepitus be elicited on flexing the reduced bones, and the deformity readily returns when the support is withdrawn, then there is fracture of the coronoid process, as well as dislocation of the bones. Tt may be possible, by firm pressure in the anti-cubital fossa, to

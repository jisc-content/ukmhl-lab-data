Applied Anatomy: 290 RESUME of Lister's amputation through the middle of the thigh 1. ]\Iake internal and external lateral incisions, each equal to two-thirds of the diameter of the limb, from a point about two inches below the point where the bone is to be divided. 2. Join the lower ends across the front of the thigh, forming a square-shaped flap with well-rounded angles. 3. Shape the posterior flap, making it fully half the length of the anterior, cutting at an angle of forty-five degrees to the axis of the limb. 4. Eaise both flaps to the upper limit of lateral incisions. 5. Then retract all the tissues for fully an inch, clear the femur, and saw it. After the periosteum has been divided, do not pull back the flaps any more; and in sawing the bone direct the assistant to make gentle traction in the axis of the limb, to avoid spHntering. Fig. 60.

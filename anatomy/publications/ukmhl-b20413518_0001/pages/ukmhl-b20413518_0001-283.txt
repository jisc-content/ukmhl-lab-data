2G5 Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 3. Make a similar incision on the outer asjaect, directly over tlio fibula, but beginning one inch higher up than the one on the inner aspect, •i. Join the lower ends of these incisions across the front of the leg, forming a square-shaped flap "with well-rounded angles. 5. In the same way form a posterior flap about one-half or two-thirds the length of the anterior. G. Eertect both flaps to the level of the upper end of the inner incision. 7. Eeflect all the soft parts one inch higher up, clear the bones, and saw them with the usual precautions—• fibula thrown well forwards, and divided before the tibia, and the sharp anterior angle of the tibia to be removed. Other methods are sometimes employed, as— 4. A Short Anterior Semi-lunar Flap made by dissection, and a long posterior by transfixion, the bones being divided a little above the base of the flaps. 5 Modified Circular.—But of all others the best method is by some form of long anterior flap and short posterior, as in the operations already described; as this afi"ords the best covering, since the bones are placed nearer the anterior aspect of the limb, and the cicatrix is out of the \vay of pressure, so that tlie patient can bear a part of tlie Aveight of the body on the end of the stump, the rest being supported by the prominence of the calf muscles, and tlie heads of the tibia and fibula. For the Structures divided see " Amputation through the Calf," but adding to the list there given—(1) The peroncus tertius muscle, and (2) anterior peroneal arteiy. UPPER TWO THIRDS OF THE LEG. The limb is to be drained of blood, and haBmorrhage provided against, as in the previous amputations — either by the elastic tourniquet applied above the knee, or else by the tliumbs of an assistant pressing on tlie femoral artery below Poupart's ligament. The patient is placed as in tlic previous operations. In tliis situation tlic bones lie nearer tlic anterior aspect of the limb, and.

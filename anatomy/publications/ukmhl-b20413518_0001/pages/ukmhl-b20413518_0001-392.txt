I iiatoiiiy: from the tubercle of the ulna, at the base of tlie coronoid process, to the radius a little below the bicipital tuberosity; and (2) the interosseous membrane which passes obliquely downwards and inwards from the interosseous ridge of the radius to that of the ulna; a little above its lower end there is an aperture through Avhich the anterior interosseous vessels pass to the back of the fore-arm to anastomose with the posterior. Between its upper border and the oblique ligament the posterior interosseous vessels jjass to the back of the arm. III. The Inferior Radio-Ulnar.—This, like the superior, is a lateral ginglymus. Its Ligaments are—(1) The anterior radio-ulnar, (2) the posterior radio-ulnar, (3) the triangular inter-articular fibro- cartilage, on Avhich the bead of the ulna rests; its base is attached to the radius, and its apex to the depression at the base of the styloid process of the ulna. The Synovial Membrane of this joint is called the membrana sacciformis. The Movements of the joint are limited to rotation of the radius round the head of the ulna—rotation forwards is called pronation, and rotation backwards supination; the latter is much more poAver- ful than the former, hence mechanics' tools, such as gimlets, etc., are so made that they are introduced by movements of supination chiefly. Another familiar example, and one more generally appreci- ated, is the cork-screw. The muscles of pronation are the pronator radii teres and the pronator quadratus; those of siqn'natioii, the supinator radii brevis, the biceps iiexor cubiti, and the supinator radii longnis. Professor Heiberg and j\Ir Cathoart have shown that the ulna also moves in pronation and supination; in both cases it is a circumduction, each bone describing a cone, but that of the ulna is the smaller, this bone also moving in the opposite direction to the radius. INIr Cathcabt believes that this movement takes place slightly at the elboAV joint, but principally at the shoulder, by a rotation of the humerus; in supination the elbow is brought to the side, but in pronation it is carried away from the side—adducted in the one case, abducted in the other. It should be noticed that the fibres of the interosseous membrane arc so arranged that much of ih(>. force transmitted along the length of the radius is passed on

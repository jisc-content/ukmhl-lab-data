Applied Anatomy: 472 directions, probably witli tlio production of crepitus; for tbis purpose the Surgeon places bis band flat over tbe great trochanter, Avbile an assistant grasps tbe foot and gently rotates tbe wbole limb. Tbe great trochanter is raised as sbown by Bryant's test, or tbe still simpler and more effective metbod used by Professor Chiene (Fig. 97). On rotating tbe foot it will be noticed tbat tbe trochanter rotates round a smaller circle tban tbe trochanter of tbe sound side. As the patient stands the knee is flexed some- -what and tbe heel raised. In the usual state of tbe parts, in health, blood is brought to tbe head of tbe bone by the ligamentum Fig. 97.

In non-impacted fracture of the usual kind, all these sources, save tbe ligamentum teres, and, perhaps, tbe synovial membrane, are cut ofi-; for this reason it is said, and, perhaps, also because the parts are not kept in proper apposition, the union is usually by fibrous tissue only. In those tbat heal by lona it is presumed tbat tbe fracture has probably been impacted, or sub-periosteal, or not strictly mtra- ca]3sular.

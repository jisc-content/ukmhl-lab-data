354 Applied Anaioviy: CHAPTER XXI. DISLOCATIONS. Before describiug the dislocations of tlie u^jper extremity in detail, let me say a few words about THE ANATOMY OF A JOINT. From the Surgeon's point of view, and for the purposes of Pathology, a joint may be regarded as consisting of three essential parts—(1) The synovial membrane, (2) the articular or encrustiug cartilage, and (3) the bone. Some joints also, as the knee, possess inter-articular hbro-cartUages, and round about all joints we have ligaments and soft tissues, but tliese structures are usually only affected secondarily. 1. The Synovial Membrane.—This structure resembles to a great extent, in structure and relations, a serous membrane; its communication with lymphatics, however, does not seem to l)e so intimate as the latter structure, so that effusions into its cavity are not so readdy absorbed again as in tlie case, for example, of the peritoneum. It lines the inner surface of the ligamentous structures surrounding the joint, and is reflected from them on to the articular ends of the bones, but stops short at the edge of the articular encrusting cartilage, at least in the adult; in the newly-born child it probably covers the encrusting cartilage as well. I ought to mention, however, that iNEr Bryant holds that even in the adult it covers the encrusting cartilage, a view also left on record by the late Professor Spenci!;. In the case of joints containing niter- articular libro-cartilages, we find that both sides of such cartilages are covered by a complete layer of synovial membrane; and further, in joints containing iuter-articular ligaments we find tlic j^ynovial

498 Applied A natoiny: The "Stirrup Splint" (Syme).—Tliis is a wooden spliut witli one end like a liorse-shoe, and two holes through the upper end; it is mounted in the same way as Dupuytridn's spHnt. A sheet or large towel is also required, rolled up from each side towards the centre, forming a pad very thick at each side hut less so in the middle, so that when apphed along the front of the sharp edge of the tibia, the splint may rest on the rolled up thick parts of °the pad, in this way fulfilling two purposes, first steadying the splint, and secondly protecting the sharp edge of the bone from pressure (Fig. 109). This splint was formerly used to prevent retraction of the heel in fracture of both bones of the leg low down; it may also be used at the same time to overcome excessive inversion or eversion. Like the last splint it is most difficult to fasten on and keep in position; and very often the patient could not bear it, as the soft parts in front are sometimes injured. Fig. 109. Pad for "Horse-shoe" Splint. I ■] KiiUnt. Special Pad. ,IIoUow for the Crest of tlie Tibia. Tasten a pad, like tliat used with DuPUYTRli^'s sphnt, iirmly to the splint by slip knots, so that the doubled end is level witli the midcUe of the arch of the horse-shoe. Place the special pad alon" the front of the tibia, and then lay the splmt along the front of the tibia with the prongs on either side of the foot. Tlien n handkerchief, or bandage, is brought under the tip of the heel, neither above nor below that pohit-if brought in front ot tlio sole it would push the heel backwards, and if applied bighcr up it would simply cause greater displacement. It is tjien carried round the shoulders of the prongs, there crossed, and the figure-ol- ght completed round splint and ankh^ and fastened. The ob.ect is simply io lift up the heel and hang it to the end o the hoi.- shoe. Lastly, the upper end of the splint is astened to tl e k hy a turn ul bandage passed through the two h,h.. there, ,so that

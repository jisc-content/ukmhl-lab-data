Then at once plug up the opening by comin-esses of cotton wool wrung out of some cold antiseptic; this is for the purpose of controlling hfemorrhage by pressure. The cut edges of the conjunctiva may or may not be brought together by sutures, according to the inclination of the operator. Pressure must be kept up for six or eight hours by means of sponges or cotton wool. If this operation be performed for malignant tumours of the orbit (sarcomata) the whole contents must be cleared out; for simple conditions a less radical method will suffice, the chief thing to be kept in mind being that whatever else is left, the corneal tissue must be all removed. Structures Divided.—The ocular conjunctiva; the capsule of Tenon ; the four recti; the two obliques; the ciliary arteries and nerves; the optic nerve with the arteria centralis retinte; branches of the third and fifth nerves; and twigs of the ophthalmic artery and vein. INJURY TO EYE. The possible results of a blow on the eye are:— 1. Temporary paralysis of accommodation from concussion. 2. Commotio retinaj, and possibly also detachment of the retina. 3. Effusion of blood into the anterior chamber, or into the vitreous. 4. Superficial septic ulcer of cornea, with pus in the anterior chamber. 5. Dislocation of lens. 6. Detachment of the iris from its ciliary connections (the zonule of Zinn). 7. Eupture of the lens capsule and traumatic cataract from the lens imbibing the aciueous. 8. Inflammation of the iris and ciliary processes. 9. Growth of a sarcoma. 10. Fissure through the optic foramen, causing blindness from injury to the optic nerve, which is followed at iv later date by atrophy of that structure.

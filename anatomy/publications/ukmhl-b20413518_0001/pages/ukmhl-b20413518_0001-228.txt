210 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTER XIV. AMPUTATIONS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY ( Continued). The Wrist.â€”The chief object iu amputatiug at the Avrist, in preference to higher up the arm, is not so much for the long stump thus left, as to preserve the movements of pronation and supination unimpared. To insure this it is necessary that the mferior radio- ulnar articulation should be healthy; hence, it is no use performing this amputation in cases of disease of the wrist joint, for then the radio-ulnar articulation is almost sure to be implicated, and a better stump will be secured by amputating through the lower third of the fore-arm. It is specially suitable in cases of injury. In all the different methods the arm should be emptied of blood by elevation, and the brachial artery secured by an elastic tour- niquet or some other means. The Surgeon should stand in front of the patient, or on the right side, while the assistant stands facing the Surgeon and supporting the fore-arm at a convenient hei^^ht. The instruments required are, a strong-bladed and sharp-pointed knife, artery forceps and ligatures, bono pliers, and a small saw. . 1. Teale's Method (Eedangidar Flaps).-K long posterior flap composed of sicin and subcutaneous fatty tissue only, is raised from the back of the hand, its length and breadth being each equal to the circumference of the arm at the wrist joint; the anterior flap is to be one-fourth the length of the posterior, and, like it, to consist only of the integumentary structures. P.oth flaps are to be carefully raised, doing as little damage as possible to the smal subcutaneous vessels. Next, the extensor tendoius are divided_ at the base of the posterior flap, and the joint opened ; ni opemng

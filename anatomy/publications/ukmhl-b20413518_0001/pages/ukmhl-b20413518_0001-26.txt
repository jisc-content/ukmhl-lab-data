6 Applied Anatomy: slit will open out at eacli systole. (4) The pulse in the vessel beyond the aneurism is delayed, smaller and weaker than it should be. (5) Pressure effects, e.g., pain, which may either be lancinating and intermittent, or continuous and aching, muscular weakness, and oedema from pressure on the veins. (6) Presence of a bruit and thrOl. Note, that many of these signs will be absent in consolidation. DIAGNOSIS.—(1) From solid tumours placed over large arteries —(a) The pulsation is chiefly felt along the line of the artery and not in the lateral expansions, and is heaving in character, not expansile; (6) the tumour is movable in the course of the artery as well as from side to side: aneurismal tumours are only movable laterally, not in the length of the artery; (c) it neither collapses nor is compressible when the artery above is commanded, nor is the tension increased when the artery below is compressed; (d) all movement is stopped at once by pressure on the proximal side of the tumour, and returns at once as strongly as ever when the pressure is removed: in an aneurism, the pulsation returns gradually, and does not attain its full force for a few seconds; (e) it may be puUed away from the artery when the pulsation is lessened, or lost altogether: in the abdomen, it may be possible to produce the same effect by making the patient support himself on his hands and knees, when the tumour will fall away from the pulsating artery; (/) bruit and thrill usually absent, and so also alterations in the arterial pulse beyond. (2) From an abscess situated over a large artery—(«) An abscess forms an incompressible and immovable fluctuating swelling, and has an ill-defined outline; (b) it began with signs of inflammation, forming a solid swelling which has gradually softened. An aneurism begins as a soft swelling, and tends to become harder, (f) When the artery above is compressed, the pulsation stops, but returns at once as strongly as ever when the pressure is removed; further, the pulsation is felt mainly in the line of the vessel. (3) Cysts are much more sharply defined than abcesses, and are more or less of a globular shape, whereas an abscess is hemispherical restincr on a stool of condensed inflammatory tissue, and has a hanl rim of the same structure round it; further, cysts are usually freely movable, and, in some cases, may be reducible, e.g., synovial cysts near the knee joint in cases of chronic rheumatic arthritis, in the

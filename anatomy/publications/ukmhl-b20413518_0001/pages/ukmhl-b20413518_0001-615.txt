'Dr Hughes' book will supply the gap existing betwixt the more elaborate Mauuals of Surgical Anatomy ou the one hand, and the mere outlines, used for "cramming" purposes, on the other. The work is a useful one, and we have perused it with the result of finding that most of the important points involved in the common work of tlio Sur^eun have been duly noted. The section on Hernia in particular strikes us as being excellently done. The Plates illustrating the book have the relations of Arteries, Veins, and Nerves printed in colours, this plan facilitating easy reference to the details they expound.' — Glasgow Herald.

Applied Anatomy: 458 two and a half inches of the wrist joint, is called a " Collkh's fracture." Next to fracture of the clavicle, the lower end of the radius is most frequently hroken; and fracture of both wrists ("double CoLLEs's") forms the commonest double fracture. From thirty years of age onward it occurs with increasing frequency in women. The great sign of this fracture is deformity, being caused in the first instance by the force that breaks it, and kept up by the impaction and by the extensors of the wrist and thumb, as weU as all the other iiexors and extensors passing over the broken radius. The radius is very frequently splintered into the ■wrist joint (Chiene). The lower fragment is drawn upwards and backwards and to the radial side by the supinator longus, flexors, Fig. 91.

The knife used by Chopart was about six inches long, half-an-inch broad, sharp-pointed, and stout-backed. SujDpose the operation is to be performed by tlie third method, the Surgeon places his thumb and forefinger on the two bony points already indicated, and fidly extends the ankle joint, and then makes a semi-lunar incision down to the bone, marking out a flap about an inch and a half Fig. 48. Incisions for Chopart's Amputation. in length, commencing and ending well in the sole, and half-an- inch in front of the bony guides. The assistant retracts this flap as the Surgeon frees it by a few touches of the knife. This being done, the assistant next seizes the toes and holds the foot at right angles to the leg and pressed firmly against the table, while the operator forms the plantar flap by cutting along the sides of the foot as far as the " tread," and joining the two side incisions by a gently curved one in front, but taking care that it leaves the flap nuxch longer on the inner than tlie outer side, as the inner edge of the foot is much deeper; tlic llap sliould be somewhat square- shaped, with well rounded angles. Wlien the llap is fully dissected down, the foot is again extcmlcd, the bones disarticulated, and the

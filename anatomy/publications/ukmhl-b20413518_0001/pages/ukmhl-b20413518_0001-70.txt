Applied Anatomy: 52 In concluding this section let me enumerate the chief risks or modes of death:— THE HEART. 1. Failure may he induced hy the fainting or syncope induced by or accompanying vomiting; this is most likely to occur when the patient is but half under, or should he suddenly assume the upright position; it may also be caused by fatty heart occasionally, or be the result of a prolonged operation. The face is very pale, and in such cases the head should be lowered or even allowed to hang over the end of the table; the vapour of nitrite of amyl may be inhaled and ether injected subcutaneously. 2. The heart may fail suddenly from reflex inhibition. To avoid this see that the patient is deeply under, or atropia may be injected previously. 3. It may gradually fail from overdose of chloroform, the med- ullary centres and the intrinsic ganglia being gradually poisoned. 4. Sudden failure before the respirations have ceased, "without evident cause ("primary failure"). This form is fortunately rare, but when it does occur little can be done. Treat the case as one of asystole—inject ether, brandy, or digitalis; inhale amyl nitrite, and keep up artificial respiration. THE RESPIRATION. 1. It may be interrupted by falling back of the tongue. 2. It may be stopped by the glottis closing; this is usually preceded by snoring, stertor, or stridor. 3. It may stop slowly from overdose of chloroform, the respira- tions gradually dying away, the centres being slowly poisoned. 4. The glottis may be blocked up or thrown into spasm by the entrance of vomited matters. JSToTE.— (1) That the chest may be heaving vigorously and yet no air enter, as the tongue may have fallen back, or the glottis closed. (2) That air may be expired and yet none be inspired, as the glottis may flap together in such a way as to prevent inspira- tion, but yet allow of a certain amount of expiration.

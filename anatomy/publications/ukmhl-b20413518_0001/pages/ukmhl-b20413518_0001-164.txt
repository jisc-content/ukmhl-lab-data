146 Applied Anatomy The Deep Epigastric Artery.—This vessel arises from the external iliac about a quarter or half-an-inch above Poupart's ligament J it then descends to the level of that ligament and curves forwards to reach the anterior aspect of the peritoneal bag, and after this passes upwards and inwards to enter the sheath of the rectus. At first it lies in the fat, between the peritoneum and the fascia transversalis, then piercing this fascia, enters the sheath of the rectus by passing in front of the fold of Douglas. It has many important Surgical relations.—(1) It forms the outer boundary of Hesselbach's triangle; (2) it is directly in the way in ligature of the external iliac artery by Sir Astley Cooper's incision; (3) with the internal mammary it forms a direct com- munication between the subclavian, intercostals, and external iliac, and is therefore an important medium of coUateral circulation in ligature of either of these vessels; (4) it lies close to the inner side of the internal abdominal ring; (5) the spermatic cord in the inguinal canal Ues in front of it, only separated from it by the fascia transversalis; (6) the vas deferens hooks round its outer side. Its -branches are—(a) Cremasteric, to the cremaster muscle; {b) j)ubic, to anastomose with a corresponding branch from the obturator; (c) cutaneous; and (d) muscular. The Deep Circumflex Iliac Artery.—Arises from the outer side of the external iliac about the same level as the deep epigastric, and runs outwards behind Poupart's ligament to the anterior superior iliac spine, then along the crest and anastomoses with the ilio-lumbar artery. Like the deep epigastric it at first hes m the extra-peritoneal fat, between the peritoneum and the fascia trans- versahs; it then pierces this fascia and hes between it and the transversalis muscle, and lastly pierces the muscle and hes between it and the internal oblique. The branch between the internal oblique and the transversalis muscles forms a useful landmark in operations in this region, as in Abernetht's method of securing the external iliac artery. It is also an important collateral supply in ligature of the external iliac. In aneurism of the external iliac there is pain in the lumbar region along the crest of the Uium in the testicle and scrotum, and down along the front and outer side of the thigh, from pressure on the branches of the lumbar plexus.

Applied Anatomy: 34 CHAPTER IV. ANEURISM OF THE THORACIC AORTA. Although this part of the aorta, for ohvious reasons, is never tied during life, still aneurism in some part of its course in the thorax is, unfortunately, the most common of all forms of aneurism, and a knowledge of its relations to the surrounding structures is ahsolutely essentiaUn order to interpret the leading symptoms. To pomt out these relations, therefore, and the chief untoward effects Hkely to be produced when these relations are distiu-hed by disease, will form a fitting introduction to the subject of ligature of special arteries There are many reasons why aneurism should be so common here:-(l) It is much curved; (2) it gives off large branches; (3) the fii-st part of the arch has no sheath, and the rest of the thoracic aorta is but feebly supported; (4) the jet of blood driven against its upper wall at each systole is apt to bulge the coats at that point; (-5) sudden variations in pressure accorclmg to the state of the heart; (6) the aspiration of the thorax affects it, for as the chest enlarges the vessel tends to expand. FIRST OR ASCENDING PART.â€”It arises from the base of the left ventricle at the level of the sixth dorsal vertebra behind and the third left costal cartilage in front. From this point it passes upwards, to the right, and forwards, and touches the sternum at the upper border of the second right costal cartilage. This part of the arch is contained in tlie fibrous pericardmm, and is siuTOunded by a tube of the serous pericardium common to it and the pulmonary artery before its bifurcation; this depends on the fact that both vessels are developed from the lulhus arteno^s (tmmus communis arteriosus) of the embryo.

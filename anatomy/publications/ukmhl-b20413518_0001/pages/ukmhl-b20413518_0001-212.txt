194 Applied Anatomy: CHAPTER, XIII. AMPUTATIONS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. In regard to amputations of the thumL and fingers, the cardinal principles to be kept in mind are—1. To keep up the full bi-eadth of the hand, so that it may retain, as far as possible, its grasping and lifting powers; and, in order to do this, the heads of the metacarpal bones, at least of the second and third fingers, must not be interfered with, for a contracted hand is a weak hand, however shapely it may appear. 2. To save as much as possible, and to maintain the opposability of the thumb or any remnant thereof. 3. Not to interfere with the palm. 4. That the ugliest and worst natural appendage is immensely superior, to its possessor, to the most ingenious and artistic artificial hand. In performing amputations on the dead body the following instru- ments are required :—(1) A proper knife or knives, (2) bone pliers, (3) a proper saw, (4) lion forceps, (5) artery forceps, (6) ligatures, and (7) scissors. They must be all selected before beginning the operation, and placed on a small tray, within easy reach of the operator's right hand. The subject should be brought well to the side of the table in all amputations of the upjoer extremity. A TERMINAL PHALANX. This amputation may be rendered necessary for injury or disease. A very common cause is the result of a bad whitlow. In whitlow, or abscess of the pulp, the'bone is very apt to necrose, on account of the close connection between the fibrous tissue composing the pul]3 and the fibrous periosteum immediate^ below. The base of the bone, however, usually escapes, because there the tendon of the long flexor is attached, and is surrounded by its sheath, and this, it would appear, protects the periosteum.

418 Applied Anatomy: the signs resemble acute lobar pneumonia. There is sudden dyspnrea, rapid, laboured breathing and cyanosis, rapid weak pulse and turbulent heart, but on auscultation the air is heard to enter and leave the lungs freely; sometimes fat is observed floating on the surface of tlie urine. (2) It also helps towards an explanation of the origin of pyEemia—e.^/., following compound fractures of the bones of the head. The mouths of the veins are, as I said, patent and non-collapsable, and the usual steps of the process are probably the foUowing—(«) Osteo-phlebitis with thrombosis in the open mouths; {h) this thrombus is septic, or readily becomes so, and therefore (c) tends to break down (= the old ''suppurative phlebitis"), and (d) forms minute.septic emboh, which are carried far and wide by the blood-stream, and are cauoht at points where the vessels break up into capiUaries, as ui the^lungs and liver, and when the little plugs come to rest, the micro-organisms they contain begin to multiply, and hence we have (e) the secondary abscesses. But the same series of changes may occur even though the veins in the bone be not torn across, as their waUs are so thin that septic processes readdy spread from the bone into the vein, forming a true septic phlebitis, as m idiopathic osteo-myehtis, which often exists along with " acute necrosis." 2 The shaft of a long bone is suppUed chiefly by the periosteum. If we look at the surface of the shaft of a long bone we can see a large number of minute longitudinal grooves, in which the vessels lie before entering the substance of the bone; at the ends of tlie grooves, by the aid of a pocket lens, we can also see very toe oblique openings-in fact, the ends of Haversian canals, into which the vessels pass. It is usually taught that if the periosteum be stripped from a bone the bone wiU die, but this does not ncces- saril,l follow, and for various reasons-(l) If tlit. periosteum is not raised too far from the bone, the vascular connections ^nU not be torn, because many of the capillaries run for some distance along the surface of the bone, in the grooves already mentioned, before they enter the Haversian canals, and the eflusion between the bone and the periosteum simply raises them from the homont to the vertical position; further, the vessels can be puHed fen some distance out of the Haversian canals without teanng acio.. (2) Then again, even if the vascular connections are toin acioss

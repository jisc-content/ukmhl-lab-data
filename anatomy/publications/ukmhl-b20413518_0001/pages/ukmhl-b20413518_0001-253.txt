The Foot.—Just as in the palm of the hand, it is of primary im- portance to avoid all approach to a cicatrix on the sole. Therefore, whatever amputations are pei'formed, the flaps must alwaj's be taken from the plantar surface. Another point of importance is to leave the heads of the metatarsal bones. The foot is a tripod, resting on the heel, the ball of the great toe, and the ball of the little toe, and only in cases of absolute necessity shoi.dd this tripod be interfered with in any way; for whether the two anterior rests are narrowed, as in removal of the central metatarsals, or any one of the three removed, the foot is rendered unstable. By a properly shaped boot and well padded stocking any inconvenience hkely to result from the prominent heads of the first and fifth metatarsals is easily ])revented. In amputations of the toes and metatarsal bones the best knife to use is a stout, straight, broad bistoury. The Toes.—Partial amputation of the toes is but rarely per- formed, and only in the case of the great toe. In cases where any of tlie other toes are in a condition necessitating amputation, it is always better to remove them at the metatai'so-phalangeal articu- lation at once ; Ijecause, if any poition be left, it is apt to be tilted upwards and is positively in the way. Even amputation of the • listal phalanx of the great toe is less frequently performed now than formerly. Formerly it was tlie custom to amputate this I)halanx for exostosis—a form of bony growtli frequently situated '>n the dorsal aspect of tlie distal phalanx of the great toe, giving I'ise to iiuich pain and discomfort fi'ora pressing up tlie nail. At the present time, liowevcr, tlie treatment adopted is to snip off the exostosis, being especially cai-eful to destroy oi- remove all the '■artilage-covered area, and leave the, toe alone. Should it, however,

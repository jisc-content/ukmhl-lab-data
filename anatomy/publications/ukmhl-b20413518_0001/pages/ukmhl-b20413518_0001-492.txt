Applied Anatomy. 478 third. If the fracture be through the upper part of the shaft, below the lesser trochanter, the upper fragment is tilted forwards and everted by the psoas and iliacus, and drawn outwards by the external rotators and glutei muscles (Fig. 98); the lower fragment is drawn upwards behind the upper by the rectus femoris in front, and the hamstring muscles behind, and drawn inwards by the pectineus Fig. 99, Fracture near the Knee Joint.

In treating this fracture it is very difficult to place and keep the upper fragment in proper position; this is because we have no power to act upon it directly, nor overcome the muscles attached to it. In fracture through the middle of the shaft, which is by far the most common situation, the lower fragment is drawn inwards and upwards behind the upper fragment by the adductor

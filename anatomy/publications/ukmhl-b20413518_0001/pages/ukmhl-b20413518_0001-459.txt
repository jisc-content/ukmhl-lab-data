Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 445 of the lower end of the humerus, with a vertical fissure between the condyles running into the jointâ€”the T-shaped fracture; in this ease, it is said that the tij) of the olecranon acts as a wedge, producing the transverse part of the fracture; while the ridge along the middle of the greater sigmoid cavity also acts as a wedge, and produces the vertical fracture into the joint. The various forms are usually produced by fsxlls on the bent elbow. In fracture of the external condyle the fissure is usually situated between the capitellum and the trochlea; of the internal, it runs thron-h the centre of the trochlea. In the T-shaped fracture the width between tlie condyles is increased, and by grasping the condyles each can be moved independently of the other with the production of crepitus In fracture of the internal condyle into the joint, the fragment is dragged upwards and inwards, and carries the ulna with it, so that the relation between the internal condyle and the olecranon process IS normal, but not so its relation to the external condyle; there is also a marked increase into the antero-posterior breadth of the condyle. This is very frequently associated with dislocation of the head of the radius backwards. The different Fractures of the Lower End of the Humerus then, are:-(l) An oblique fracture just above the condyles- (1) separation of the lower epiphysis; (3) a transverse fracture across the lower end of the humerus, with a vertical split into the joint-" the T-shaped fracture"; (4) fracture of the internal condyle, involving the joint; (.5) fracture of the external condyle involving the joint; and (6) up to eighteen years of age, separation of the internal " epicondyle," which is wholly extra-articular Treatment of Fractures of the Condyles.-As there is usuallv considerable swelling an.l inflammation of the joint, the ordinarv means must be taken to allay the inflammation; after this ^et the bones into proper position by extension, counter-extension, and mampulation, and then put up the limb with the arm at ric^ht angles to the fore-arm and tlie hand midway between pronatbn and supination. For this purpose some use a jointed rectangular phnt on the inner aspect of the fore-arm. But, probably, the best way IS to apply two moulded poroplastic rectangular splints of such a size as almost to envelope tlie arm when padded, the posterior one reaching to the tips of the fingers. The arm i.s then supported

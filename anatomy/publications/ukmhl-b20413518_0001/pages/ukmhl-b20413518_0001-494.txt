480 Applied Anatomy: splint we require a board, four or five inches broad, long enough to reach from the axilla to six inches beyond the foot; through its upper end are two holes, and its lower end is cut into a three- pronged-like fork. This is rolled up in a sheet, so folded that it will reach from the tuber ischii to the malleoli, thus leaving the last six inches of the splint bare; enough of the sheet must be left free to surround both, limb and splint afterwards. The splint is then laid along the injured side with the free part of the sheet under the limb. The " permeal band " is next placed in position, but left slack; this consists of a padded handkerchief, or one covered with gutta-percha, passing under the perineum and tied Fig. 100.

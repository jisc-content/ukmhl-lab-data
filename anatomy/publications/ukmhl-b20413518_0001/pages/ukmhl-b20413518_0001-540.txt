526 Applied Anatomy: like other muscles; this fact is made use of iu corneal wounds to prevent prolapse: for example, in wounds situated near the circum- ference of the cornea, whether the result of accident or made by the Surgeon, a solution of Calabar bean (eserim) is dropped into the eye, since this causes contraction of the iris, and will, therefore, draw it away from the wound; Avhereas in wounds near the centre of the cornea, a solution of atropine is used to dilate the pupil, and thus again carry the iris away from the wound. The inner coat consists of the retina, which is formed by the expansion of the optic nerve, and is the seeimj part of the eye. It is thickest behind, and becomes gradually thinner as it passes forwards; it ends by a jagged margin, the era serrata, just behind the ciliary body. From within outwards it consists of the following layers:—(1) Internal limiting membrane, next the vitreous humour; (2) layer of nerve fibres; (3) layer of nerve cells; (4) inner mole- cular layer; (5) inner nuclear layer; (G) outer molecular layer; (7) outer nuclear layer; (8) external limiting membrane; (9) layer of rods and cones; and (10) layer of hexagonal pigment cells. At the yellow spot, however, the structure is a little different—the layer of nerve fibres is absent, but the layer of nerve cells consists of several strata; the rods are few, and absent altogetlier in its centre, but the cones are many and large. All the other layers are thinner, and there are scarcely any blood-vessels, only a few capillaries. When looked at, by the aid of the opthalmoscope, the following parts may be recognised:—(1) The optic disc or blind spot, one- tenth of an inch to the inner side of the axis of the eye; (2) the macida lutea or yelloto spot, as nearly as possible in the axis of the eyeball: in its centre is a slight depression—the fovea centralis; (3) the arteria centralis retime, which enters tlirough the optic disc and divides into four or five branches, which pass over the retina in various directions, but seem to avoid the macula lutea; and (4) sometimes the vessels of the choroid may be seen. The fundus itself is bright ferrety red, the depth of the colour depending on the complexion of the individual; this red appear- ance doe^ not come from the retina—which is invisible except under rare conditions-but from the choroid. When the lens is opaque, as in cataract, this redness is obscured more or less,_anri when it cannot be seen at all the cataract is said to be ripe.

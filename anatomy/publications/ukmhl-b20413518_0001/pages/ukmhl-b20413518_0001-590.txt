Fig. 119. Position of the Mastoid Antrum. (Stmingtox.) ■m. a.—Mastoid Antraiii. It should be remembered, as Dr Symington has pointed out, that there are no mastoid cells, properly so called, in infants ; in tliem the mastoid simply contains a single air cell, which com- municates with the upper chamber or attic of the tympanum. It is known as the mastoid antrum. It has also been shown that up to puberty the mastoid process is finely cancellous, but after this time air cells are developed; in many adults, however, the development of au- cells is imperfect, and in some entirely absent. In all cases, however, botli in cliildren and adults, the mastoid antrum is present, and, according to Mr Barkisr, is the point to be aimed at in suppuration of the mastoid process.

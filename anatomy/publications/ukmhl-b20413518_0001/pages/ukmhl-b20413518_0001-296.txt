278 Applied Anatomy: thumb on the two condyloid eminences of the femur, and, there- fore, nearer the posterior part of their lateral aspect than the anterior. He then marks out a long anterior flap, reaching as low as the tubercle of the tibiaâ€”the knife being entered behind, and close to his finger, and brought round to a point, close to and behind his thumb, or vice versa, according to the limb. The flap should be broad, and its edges at first straight, and its lower angles well rounded. It is then dissected up, with or without the patella; if without, Mdien the dissection has proceeded as far as the centre of that bone the assistant forcibly flexes the knee to a right angle; this pulls the patella down, and then the operator cuts into the joint by a semi-circular sweep of the knife above the upper edge of the patella and immediately above the condyles. Fig. 57. The Stump after Garden's Amputation. (Onginal FomiJ When the soft parts are much thickened and matted by disease the patella may be turned up with the flap and dissected out afterwards. The lateral, crucial, and posterior ligaments are next divided, the knife passed behind the femur, and a posterior flap cut from within outwards nearly equal in length to the anterior ; it is better to make it pretty long, because it contains the hamstring tendons, and will retract considerably. Mr Bell makes a skm flap about an inch and a half long, allows it to retract, and then divides the muscles by a cii-cular cut down to the bone at the level of the retracted skin. Both flaps are then retracted, the bone cleared to the highest point of the articular surface, and then sawn throucrh at the broadest part of the condyles, or Just below the "adductor tubercle;" the saw must be applied parallel with the articular surface of the femur, and not at right angles to the long

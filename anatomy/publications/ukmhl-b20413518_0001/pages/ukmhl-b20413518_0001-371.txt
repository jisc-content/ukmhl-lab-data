Slli'glcat, Medicat, and Operative. (I) ilake au incision (lug 72) across the sole of the foot, from a point a little in front of the tnberclc of the scaphoid to a jDoint just behind the tuberositj^ of the fifth metatarsal bone; if it be the right foot the knife is introduced on the inner border, on the left foot it begins on the outer border. (2) From the extremities of this incision make two other incisions to the base of each malleolus; and (3) unite the ends of these by a transverse cut across the back of the ankle. (4) The foot is next Hexed, the lateral ligaments divided, and tlie ankle joint opened from behind and disarticulation completed. (5) The foot is still furtlier flexed, the soft parts are carefully separated from tlie front, and disarticn- lation performed at the mcdio-tarsal articulations, as in Chopabt's amputation, and in this way tlie astragalus, the os cidcis, and the soft parts covering them arc removed. (6) Saw ofl' the articular ends of the tibia and fibula, with the malleoli, and the corres- ponding surfaces of the cuboid and scaphoid, leaving the anterior part of the foot attached to the leg by a loose bridge of soft parts. (7) Next, bring the foot into a straight line Avith the leg, and suture the cut surfaces of the bone together with wire or kangaroo tendon. (8) Fix in plaster of Paris splints, bringing the toes into a position of complete dorsiflexion. The result is an artificial talipiis eiiuinua. The limb afterwards is about a couple of inches longer than its fellow; the toes and metatarsal bones are preserved, and the toes are mobile. The patient Avalks on the ends of the metatarsal bones, like the digitigrade group of the carnivora (lions, tigers, cats, etc.) (Fig. 73), the foot being fitted with a special boot, and a specially thick sole provided for the boot of the sound foot; the patient, therefore, will be about two inches taller after this operation.

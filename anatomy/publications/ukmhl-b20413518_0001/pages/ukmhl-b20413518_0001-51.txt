0 1 Sjir^ical, Medical, and Operative. 33 COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT. The chief unfavourable results that may ensue from this operation are:—(1) Continuame or return of the pulsation in the sac from misapplied or badly applied ligature, e.g., placed obliquely instead of transversely, or from the presence of a vas aherrans, or from a too free collateral circulation, or when the ligature is applied at too great a distance from the sac. (2) Formation of cmotlier aneurism at the next weakest point of the vascular system (3) Gangrene of the limb, from the third to the tenth day, due to the too tardy establishment of an adequate collateral circulation to keep up the vitality of the limb beyond the aneurism, or from injury to the vein. (4) Suppuration and sloughing of the sac. (5) H,emorrliage when the ligature separates, from disease of the coats, or sloughing of the included portion of the vessel before the ends have become permanently sealed by the reparative process • this may be caused by lifting the vessel from its bed or slidino- the Hgature up and down, and in this way destroying its nutritive supply. The treatment after the operation should be mainly directed to avert the tendency to gangrene. The limb should be surrounded by a thick layer of carded wool to keep up its temperature, and elevated to assist the venous return. The diet should be moderately nourishing and easily digested, with the judicious use of opium winch not only soothes the patient, but also dilates the small arteries and capillaries, and thus assists the establishment of the collateral circulation. On no account should artificial warmth in the form of hot bottles, be applied to the limb, as this would only hasten the gangrene.

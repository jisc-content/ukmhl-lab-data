Applied Anatomy: 228 RESUME—The steps of Mr Spence's operation are :— 1. With the arm abducted and rotated outwards, malce a part of the vertical incision, and examine the joint if necessary. 2. Prolong the incision down through the insertion of the pectoralis major, and then curve it across through the lower fibres of the deltoid, towards but not through the posterior border of the axilla. 3. Outline the inner part of the section through stin and fat only. 4. Separate and raise the large deltoid flap with the fingers alone, to avoid injury to the large posterior circumflex artery. .5. The assistant now adducts and rotates, Avhile the burgeon divides the capsular muscles and the capsule, by cutting on the anatomical neck of the humerus, usuaUy dividing the broad subscapular tendon first. 6. Pass the knife beneath the bone, and keep its edge close to it, divide the rest of the capsule, abduct the arm, and divide the remaining soft parts on the axillary aspect, the vessels being previously grasped by an assistant. 7. Secure the vessels. 3 Double Flap by Transfixion.-Hoth flaps may be made by cutting from within outwards, and are nearly of equal size and gently" rounded. Three special assistants are i;equired-one to take charge of the Hmb ; a second to raise the deltoul flap; and a third to compress the subclavian artery against the first rib, and be prepared to follow the knife behind the humerus -^^^^^l'^ inner flap, .vitb the vessels, lefore its division.

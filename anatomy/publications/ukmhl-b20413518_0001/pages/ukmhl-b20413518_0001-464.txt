The nhia grows m length chiefly from the lower epiphysis. Hence, it will he noticed that m both cases the upper epiphyses join the shafts at puberty, and the lower at twenty; and that the two centres for the uhia appear at exactly douUe the age as that for the radial centres-radial, five and two; ulnar, ten and four. The iiwer epiphysis of the radius is entirely within the orbicular ligament; the lower includes the facet for the ulna and the insertion of the supinator longus. As regards the upper end of the lUna, the coronoid process and the chief part of the olecranon are formed from an extension of the shaft of the bone into it; the upper part only of the olecranon is Fig. 88.

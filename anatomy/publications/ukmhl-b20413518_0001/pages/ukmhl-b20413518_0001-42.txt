Applied Anatomy: 22 CHAPTER HI. LIGATURE OF ARTERIES IN CONTINUITY. THE ANATOMY OF AN ARTERY. Coats.—1. Tunica interna, or internal coat—(a) A single layer of flattened endothelial cells lining its lumen, wHcli gives to it its smoothness, and serves to lessen friction; (&) a suh-endotlieltal layer of delicate connective tissue, with ceUs, especially marked in the larger arteries; (c) an elastic layer, either in the form of a lonoitudinal elastic network, or else as a perforated membrane (the fenestrated membrane of Henle). The internal coat is very easily broken across, especially in the transverse direction, and the broken ed-e shows a great tendency to cui-1 inwards; this coat may be raptured without rupture of the external coat, and when tins is the case the edges curl inwards, a blood clot forms, the flow through the artery is checked, and finaUy, "organisation" of the clot, and complete obliteration of the vessel, takes place. 2. Tunica media, or middle coat, consists of bundles of non- striped muscular fibres disposed circularly round the vesse , mth a certain proportion of elastic fibres. In passing from the larger to the smaller arteries the proportion (in thickness) of the muscular fibres increase in comparison Avith the calibre of the vessel; but in passing from the smaller to the larger the proportion of elastic tissue increases, and hence in the aorta it is very weU marked. This coat is very easily torn by any force that compresses he artery transversely-such as a ligature-or that s retches the vessel loncdtudinally. Both the internal and middle coats aie I v ied when a ligiu-e is applied tightly round the artery. Ihe ^'tactmy of arteries depends on the middle coat, and is most marked, therefore, in the small arteries.

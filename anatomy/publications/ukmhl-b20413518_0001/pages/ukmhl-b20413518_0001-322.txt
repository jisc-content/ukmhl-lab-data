304 Applied Analomy: 4. Region of the Tarso-Metatarsal Articulation.—In cases of accident dissect up a sufficient sole flap with, if possible, a sliort dorsal, and saw the hones across at any convenient point irrespective of articulations, or perform a Hey ; for disease of the tarsal bones, as a rule, and in cases of smash in the region of the median tarsal articulation, go to the ankle joint at once. There is, however, one exception, and that is disease limited to the os calcis; in this case the carious and tubercular matter may be scraped away with every hope of a satisfactory result. 5. The Ankle Joint.—Symb, by the heel flap, or Mackenzie by large internal calcaneal flap. The numberless other plans and modifications need scarcely be considered, as the stumps left do not bear the weight of the • body better, nor are they so well adapted for progression, whatever they may be for the purposes of the instrument-maker. THE LEG AND THIGH. 1. Just above the Ankle.—The Syme flap may be utilised for two and a half inches from the lower end of the tibia. If this cannot be so utilised, then use a long anterior flap with a .short posterior, or in some cases a Teale may be adopted. 2. Through the Calf and at the "Seat of Election."—The method described in the text as Lister's, or else the "modified circular," the skin flaps being anterior and posterior, not lateral, except in cases of necessity. 3. At the Knee Joint.—A long anterior with a short posterior flap, the ends of the flaps being almost square, or Stephen Smith's " hooded flaps." 4. Through the Condyles of Femur.—Garden or Gritti. .5. At the Lower Third of the Thigh.—Spence's amputation, the "modified circular," or, occasionally, a Teale. 6. The Middle Third and below the Trochanter. — The method described as Lister's, or the "modified circular." 7. The Hip.—The method associated with Turneaux Jordan's name.

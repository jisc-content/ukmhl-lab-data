Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 217 The Structures divided iu amputations through the fore-arm will vary slightl\^ at the dilierent levels. For instance, at the upper part the pronator radii teres and supinator brevis will be divided, while at the lower part they would not be included ; and, near the wrist, the pronator quadratus and the extensor indicis would be cut, but not higher iip. To save unnecessary repetition, the following may be taken as a fairly complete general list:—1. Integumentary structures. 2. Muscles—(a) The pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis, (h) palmaris longus, (c) flexor sublimis digitorum, {d) flexor Fig. 41. Section through Fore-arm. Radial Vessels and Xervo.

Surgical, Hfediari, aud Operative. 499 the splint may not slip; und a strip of bandage is passed from one liorn of the splint to the other in front of the foot. ]]efore the "stirrup splint" came into use, in cases of great retraction of tlie heel, DuruvTREN's method Avas generally adopted, viz., a posterior splint \o pmU the heel forwards. A well padded CJoocn splint may be used for this purpose—this keeps the heel m position, aud prevents any possible retraction. The pressure 011 the heel, however, should be made as diffuse as possible in order to prevent ulceration. I wiU now give a shoi't resum6 of the different methods used m the treatment of "Pott's fracture"—Mdiich method to choose in any given case will depend much on the special displacement present, the presence and position of blisters, abrasions, or wounds compUcating the fracture. Whatever plan is adopted, the first and by far the most important part of the treatment is to put the fractured bones into as good position as possible before applvin- tlie splints. i-w o 1. The "Box Splint," properly padded to overcome the dis- placement, to overcome the eversion, jjlace one special pad just above the internal malleolus, and another over the external malleolus. See that the heel is kept well forward. 2. Dupuytren's Splint may be used in cases where tlie eversion IS excessive, and provided there is no wound or blister over tlie inner aspect of the leg. 3. Double Poroplastic Splints moulded to the limb, the bones being first carefully set, and the leg being retained in in-oper position till tlie splints become rigid. \. The "Stirrup Splint," where the backward displacement of the heel is tlie most marked symptom. Have a si)ecially prepared pad along the crest of tlie tibia, lest the splint cause ulceration of tlK! soft parts—this method jiulls the heel forwards. 5. UupuYTRKN's Posterior Splint to push the heel iurwards ^ee that the pressure over the heel is diHused j)roperly, lest a prfssure ulcer bo formed.

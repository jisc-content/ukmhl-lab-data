X Preface to Second Edition. Edinbuuoh, Mmj 1887. the Student must have the actual body heside him to see and feel for himself. The greater number of the engravings are originalâ€”most of them being prepared from rough sketches by the Author; but for their elaboration and execution I must express my thanks to Mr David L. Turnbull, who has engraved all the plates, with but five exceptions. I must also express my thanks to Messrs Longmans, Green, & Co. for permission to insert Nos. 41 and 42, aiid to Professor Cunningham for permission to insert Nos. 59 and 60, as well as to his Publishers (Messrs ^laclachlan & Stewart) for the ready and courteous manner in which they furnished the necessary electrotypes. If at times, in the drawmgs, I have sacrificed strict scientific accuracy, for the sake of impressing special points on the Student's mind, I must be excused, for what is the use of engravings unless they impress the idea they are intended to convey, and teach some practically useful fact.

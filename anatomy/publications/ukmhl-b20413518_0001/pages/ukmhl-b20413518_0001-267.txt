Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 249 Chief Structures divided in the two preceding Opera- tions.—1. The integumentary coverings and the plantar fascia. 2. Muscles—(«) Tibialis anticus and extensor brevis digitorum; {b) the extensor communis digitorum and the i^eroneus tertius; {i-) the extensor proprins hallncis ; {d) tlie pcroneus longus and brevis; («) the tibialis posticus; (/") the first layer of muscles of the sole of the foot (the flexor brevis digitorum, abductor hallucis, and abductor minimi digiti); {fj) the second layer of muscles (the tendons of tlie flexor longus digitorum and flexor longus hallucis, accessorius and lumbricales); {li) the most of the muscles of the third layer (flexor brevis hallucis, adductor hallucis, flexor brevis minimi digiti, and transversus pedis). 3. Vessels— (a) The internal plantar artery; (J,) the external plantar artery, Avith the plantar arch and its digital branches; (c) the dorsal artery of the foot, with its tarsal and metatarsal branches. 4. Nerves—(o) Anterior tibial or its branches; {I) the plantar nerves; (c) digital branches of the musculo-cutaneous or peroneal nerve; {d) the digital branch of the external saphenous nerve. 5. The Ligaments of the various joints opened into; and, further, Ave may speciaUy mention the long and the short plantar ligaments and the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid. The structures divided in PIey's operation are almost the same as the above, with the following exceptions :—The tibialis anticus and posticus and the flexor accessorius are not divided, and part of the internal cuneiform bone is removed. In Lisfkanc's operation this bone is not divided. THE ANKLE JOINT. L Syme's Method.—As in all amputations of the foot, the tibial arteries are to be secured by the thumb and fingers of an Fig. 49.

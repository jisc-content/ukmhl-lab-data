The intimate relation that the membrane bears to the fibrous structures round the joint is important from a pathological point of view, for diseases of the membrane are very apt speedily to involve the fibrous structures, as, for example, in tlie case of rheumatic and strumous inflammations; in the former it is apt to lead on to cicatricial contraction and fibrous adhesions, outside as -well as inside the joint, causing false external and false internal ankylosis. In the latter (drumous arthritis), Avhile the swelling has at first the shape of the synovial cavity, yet very soon the ligaments of the joint become gelatinised and soft, and readily yield, and then tiic joint assumes a peculiar and characteristic globular appearance, w ith lateral movement of the articular ends of the bones; this ijlntndar shape is the shape naturally assumed by fluid and semi- solid bodies Avhen left free from the action of gravity, ur from resisting forces, such as strong ligaments and fascia?, as Ave see in the case of snnple cysts, and in rapidly growing soft malignant tumours. lu strumous arthritis, further, the pulpy membrane ap- pears to creep in from all quarters over the articular cartilage, like ivy over an old wall, softening and pitting it by its granulation-liko prolongations, and leading to its complete disorganisation. •2. The Articular Cartilage.—This structure encrusts the arti- cular ends of the bones, and is of the hyaline variety; the zone of cartilage, however, next the bone is infiltrated with lime salts, or calcified, and here and tliere a cartilage cell may be observed becoming transformed into a bone corpuscle. The cells, too, arc; peculiar in their arrangement: near the articular surface they are flattened transversely, a little lower down they ai'c in irreguLiv groups, and still lower they form vertical rows. The cells are the active agents in the production and repair of the cartilage, and tiiey are also the active agents in its destruction; the cells, in di.sease, instead of forming new capsules as they divide, expend all their energy in multiplication, so that soon we lind nuisses of cells lying in cavities iu the cartilage without any ca[)sule round them.

Applied Anatomy: 82 nerves in relation to it—ahuve^ the descendeus noni; hcliind, the gangliated cord of the sympathetic; on the inner side, the recurrent laryngeal (at its lower part); on the outer side, the vagus. 4. There are four chief things to its inner side—the air passages, the food passages, thyroid hody, and recurrent laryngeal nerve with the inferior thyroid artery. In the living body it should be remembered that the vessel is overlapped throughout its entire extent by the sterno-mastoid, as this muscle does not pass in a straight line from the sterno-clavicular articulation to the mastoid process, but takes a curved course, the convexity of the curve being directed towards the middle line of the neclc. This curve is maintained by a process of deep cervical fascia attached on the one hand to the deep surface of the sterno- mastoid and on the other to the angle of the lower jaw, for as soon as it is cut the anterior edge takes a straight direction (Ellis). It may be necessary to ligature this vessel for a wound, either of itself or its branches, for aneurism, for epilepsy, for erectile and pulsating tumours of the orbit and skull, or cirsoid aneurism of the scalp; it has also been ligatru-ed for wounds in the mouth and ulceration of the tongue. As it gives off no branches it may be tied at any part of its course, but it is better to avoid tying it either close to its origin or to its termination—at its origin, on account of its great depth, and especially on the left side where the internal jugular vein is in front and the thoracic duct behind it; at its termination, because here there is a large plexus of veins ui front of it. If for a wound, it must be tied on both sides of the bleeding point and then divided between; if for a wound of its branches, or pulsating tumour higher up, it slioidd be tied in the most accessible position—above the omo-hyoid; if for an aneurism, the point of ligature will depend on its position, e.g., in aneurism of the upper part, the Huntbrian operation may be used, while in aneurism low down we may use the method suggested by Erasdor. Ligature of the vessel for cirsoid aneurism of the scalp ("aneurism by anastomosis" of some), a similar condition of the orbit, or other forms of pulsatile simple tumours of the orbit and scali), cannot be regarded as a necessary or even justifiable operation, since Dr John Duncan has proved the safety and certainty of cure by electrolysis.

Surgical, Medical, and Operative. 198 angles of the wound; they are to be cut level with the skin surface and fastened with a horse-hair suture or safety-pin, to prevent them slipping into the wound. The use of the tube is to avoid tension and pain by removing discharges, and in doing so it also removes the soil in which putrefactive organisms would flourish; the tubes may be removed at the end of twenty-four or thirty-six hours. The wound should now be filled and be again washed out with warm antiseptic lotion by means of a syringe, and then squeezed perfectly dry by means of sponges. The dressings are next applied; a strip of green protective is applied along the wound, over this a few layers of wet gauze, and then a quantity of antiseptic wool, to give gentle support and exercise equable pressure, the whole being kept in position by bandages. Last of all, in order to secure perfect rest, a posterior splint should be applied and bandaged to the limb. Professor Chiene prefers this splint to be made of fairly heavy sheet lead, with perforations; the perforations are to allow blood to come through, should hpeniorrhage occur, as otherwise the stump Avould bleed into the splint and dressings, and the patient might thus lose much blood before the accident was discovered. The stump may be raised for the first twelve or twenty-four hours, in order to lessen the risk of hccmorrhage, but after this it should be placed in a horizontal position. N

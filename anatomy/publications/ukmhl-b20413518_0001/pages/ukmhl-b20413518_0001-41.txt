The advantages are— (1) That it leaves no scar; (2) that the effect can be very easily graduated, for the amount of hardening can be felt as the operation proceeds. It is important not to allow the points of the needles to approach the skin too closely lest it be cauterised and produce sloughing, M'hich will not only leave a scar, but also forms an inlet for the admission of septic organisms, which will lead, nnless great care be taken, to breaking down of the blood clot. Many other measures have been tried, but, on the whole, with little success; some of these may be enumerated—(1) Compression, a very doubt- ful proceeding; (2) ligature of the branches passing to the affected part, usually unsuccessful, on account of the free anastomoses; also Hgature of the arteries on both sides of the mass; (3) extirpation en masse, by knife or ligature; (4) injection of coagulating fluids, which may at one time cause sloughing and at another be absolutely Avithout eftect, and is, therefore, on the whole, unsatisfactory.

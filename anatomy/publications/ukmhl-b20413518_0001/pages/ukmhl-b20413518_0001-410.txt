Applied A natomy: 392 This method can be used anywhere and by any one, without disturbing the patient in the least. Of course, it only shows the upward displacement of the trochanter, but it could easily be combined with an apparatus like that used by Mr Morris, when it would show at a glance not only the amount of the upward displacement, but the amount of the inward displacement as well, and even the extent of eversion or inversion (Fig. 75). Fig. 75. Fracture of the Neck of the Femur. Aiitoriur Superior Spiuc. Anterior Superior Spine. Friietured Side. Middle Line. Healthy Side. ObsciTG, on the Fractured Side, that not only i.s the Trochanter raised, but it is also nearer the Middle Line. To judge of the position of the head of the femur in dislocations look to the lie of the internal condyle of the femur, because tlie direction of the head and that of the internal condjde are almost the same (Bigelow). Other useful Measurements in injuries of the lower extremity are :â€”(1) The total length of the limb from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tip of either malleolus. (2) The length of the thigh, from the same point to the upper edge of the patella, or to the adductor tubercle. (3) The length of the leg, from tlic upper edge of either tibial condyle to the tip of the corresponding malleolus.

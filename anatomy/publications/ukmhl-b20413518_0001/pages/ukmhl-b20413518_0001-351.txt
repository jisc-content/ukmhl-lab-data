Thk term " excision of the hip," as ordinarily understood, means removal of the head of the femur only, although the acetabulum may also be removed, if thought necessary. Cases requiring this operation may be classified as usual—1. For Disease, advanced strumous disease, accompanied by abscesses, where the patient IS in danger of perishiug from exhaustion, and the disease has passed beyond the hope of cure by natural means; the usual means, such as complete rest, extension, incisions to evacuate pus and sequestra, scraping, etc., having been patiently tried and failed. In some cases abscesses do not form (the "arthritic" form of the disease), the disease in this case, it is said, having Its origin in the synovial membrane, the patient recovering with a useful, thougb stiffened joint. Just as in the shouldei° the liead of the femur is more frequently attacked than the acetabulum, and the upper epiphysis may often be found lying in a state of caries on the dorsum ilii, or in a suppurating cavity with sinuses leading down to it, but tlic pelvic bones not aifected. Tn these cases excision is indicated to save from a lingering deatli from "hectic" and widespread waxy disease of the viscera, or from ttidious years of sulfering, and to secure a more useful limb than nature will, unaided, provide; and the slight operation required lor tins purpose docs not place the patient in any worse position, I.') say the least of it, than ho was in before, and not only so, but removes the cause of the "hectic"—a chronic form of blood puisoning.

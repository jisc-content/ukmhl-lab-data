454 Applied Anatomy: radius just below the external condyle; if the head moves with, and as fast as, the hand and lower end of the radius, there can be no fracture. Fracture of the Radius below the insertion of the pronator radii teres.—Here the fracture is between the two pronators and the upper fragment is drawn upwards; or, rather, it tends to be tilted forwards and supinated by the biceps, and inwards by the pronator radii teres. The displacement inwards, however, may not be creat, as the pronator radii teres is powerfully opposed by the supinator brevis and biceps, so that the bone retains a position midway between pronation and supination. The upper fragment is therefore held between the supinator brevis and biceps on the one hand, and the pronator radii teres on the other, nearly in its proper position. The lower fragment is drawn towards the lOna, and pronated by the unopposed action of the pronator quadratus, while the supinator longus tilts up the styloid process and depresses the upper end of the fragment; the lower fragment therefore usually lies in front of the upper. Tliere is a swelling m front and behind, and the hand falls in and is pronated (compare with CoLLEs's fracture). . ^^^n,. Fracture of the Ulna alone near its m.ddle.-This is usuaUj the result of clM violence, because the bone is so superficia , as in carrying something in the hands, e.g., a tray, when the foo slip and, to save the contents of the hand, the whole force of the faU s received on the posterior edge of the ulna. So also it m y be broken by a blow from a stick when the arm is held up to piote the head ; or in falling against the edge of a ^oor-step. In th case there is but little displacement of the upper fragment, except hat it is drawn a little nearer the radius by the pronator radii eras and forwards by the brachialis anticus; the ower fragm^^^^^^ is drawn towards the radius by the T''--'-'T ^^,^1 extensors and flexors tend to draw it upwards Although e dS lac-ent, due to muscular action, ^^^^ ^f.^? ^if^^^JZ f L fhnt breaks the bone may cause a good deal, as it lorces in« bX„ iSwaris »ams, n»ro,vi„g the intevo^seous sp«» have no po,ve. to act directly ,u« ^ "™S into a proper position.

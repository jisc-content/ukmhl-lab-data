The lower fragment is carried backwards and upwards behind the upper fragment by the triceps, biceps, and the brachialis anticus muscles, just as in fracture proper, but the anterior projection is broader and more rounded than in fracture. In fracture, separation of the epiphysis, and dislocation of both Ijones baclvM-ards, the general appearance is the same (Fig. 85); but in fracture and separation of the epiphysis the bony points about Fig. 85.

In Fracture proper the displacement is very similar to the above, the lower fragment is pulled upwards and backwards behind the upper, and cai'rics the fore-arm with it; .so that the olecranon projects unnaturally, and there is a hollow above it (Fig. 85).

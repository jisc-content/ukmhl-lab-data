Before describing fractures in detiiil, I will give a sliort accoiuit of the ANATOMY OF A BONE, Taking a long bone, such as the femur, we see it consists of a shaft and two extremities. The shaft consists of a thick layer of compact tissue externally, with a thin lining of cancellous tissue, and encloses the medullary canal, and this in turn contains the yellow marrow, which consists chiefly of fat and blood-vessels; m some cases of fracture this fat passes into tlie circulation and causes llitty emboli in the pulmonary capillaries. The articular cuds of the bone consist almost entirely of cancellous tissue, with a thin covering of compact bone whicli gradually becomes thinner until it ceases at the margin of the articular cartilage; this spongy tissue contains the red or hloocl-forming marrow, although the larger cancelli contain principally yellow marrow. It is in this part also that the '^myeloid," or "giant cells," are found, which probably explains their presence in sarcomatous tumours of the articular ends of bones. The Periosteum. —This is a fibrous membrane, formin- a complete external covering to the bones, except where they°are covered with cartilage and at the insertion of strong tendons It consists of two laycrs-(«) an outer layer, composed of elastic and white fil,rous tissue, running longitudinally for the most part, and (b) an inner layer which is soft and cellular, and in which the blood-vessels break up before entering the bone. The cells next the bone are called odeoUasis, or bone-forming cells, and tlic wlu^le inner layer is sometimes called the u4eu<jemtic layer •

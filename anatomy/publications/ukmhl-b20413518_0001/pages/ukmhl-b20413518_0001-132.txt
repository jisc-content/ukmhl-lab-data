114 Applied Anatomy: bracliialis is the guide; the median nerve is to its outer side, and the ulnar and internal cutaneous to its inner side. The steps of the operation are precisely similar to ligature of the third part of the axillary, low doAvn. (2) In its middle third, below the origin of both the profunda arteries, the point usually selected; the edge of the biceps is the guide to the vessel and the median nerve crosses it obliquely. (3) In the lower tilird at the bend of the elbow, and below the origin of all its branches; it lies between the tendon of the biceps on the outer side, and the median nei-ve on the inner side, and covered by the bicipital fascia and the median basilic vein.

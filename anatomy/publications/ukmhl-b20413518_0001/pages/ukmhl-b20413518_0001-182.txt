It may be exposed by—(1) a median incision either over the centre of the space or over its lower angle, where it lies between the two heads of the gastrocnemius; (2) by an incision on the inner side above (Jobert); (3) by an incision on the inner side below (Marshall). All the incisions should be about four inches long. 1. iVIedian Incision.—The patient should be laid on his face, and the Surgeon stands on the outer side and makes an incision

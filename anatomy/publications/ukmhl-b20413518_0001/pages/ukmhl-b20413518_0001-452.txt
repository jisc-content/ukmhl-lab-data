438 Applied Anatomy: upward displacement. The late Professor Spence taught that the dhoxo sliould he supported, so as to keep the ends of the hone m apposition, and secure firm union; (5) the arm must then he firmly bandaged to the trimh by a broad domett bandage, but must not be carried across the chest, as in fracture of the clavicle, as this would bend the bone at the seat of fracture, and cause angling. Some advise that the hand and fore-arm should be bandaged lightly so as to avoid venous congestion, but this is unnecessary, and may even be injurious. No splints are required, but if necessary a gutta-percha cap may be moulded over the shoulder and upper part of the humerus, to steady the parts, especially in the case of children or restless patients; or the cap may be made of moulded " poroplastic" material, with a rect- angular splint attached, of the same material, to pass along the outer side of the arm and fore-arm to the tips of the fingers; this will insure perfect rest to the mjured bone. feplmts are of no use as regards co-aptation of the fragments, for it is im- possible to put the internal splint so high as the fracture, and one spluit alone is useless. In cases where the upper ragmen persistently abducted, and it is consequently impossible to brin t into Hue with the lower, the lower fragment must then he abducted, to bring it into line with the upper some such mean as "Middledorpfs triangle" being used for ^1-^ m--; J^^; fracture unites in from four to five weeks m youth, but requires longer in old ageâ€”two to five months.

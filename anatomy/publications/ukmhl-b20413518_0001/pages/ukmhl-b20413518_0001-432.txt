416 Applied Anatomy: this layer is also prolonged into the Haversian canals. In young subjects it is very cellular and soft, hut as age advances it becomes more fibrous and contains fewer osteoblasts; in amputations per- formed on young persons, therefore, oue must be very careful, after the bone is divided, not to strip back the periosteum by pulling on the flaps. Further, since the periosteum, from the arrangement of its fibrous layer, tends to split longitudinally and not circularly, it is necessary in subperiosteal resections, not only to divide the periosteum longitudinalhj, but to make transverse cuts as well, otherwise the membrane will strip up far beyond the part required; this is well shown in resections of the ribs, the upper part of the femur, and in many other situations. The Haversian canals contain blood-vessels for the nourishment of the bone, fine connective tissue, lymphatics, and nerves, and a lining of osteoblasts or bone-forming cells. In the mediillary canal ^ of a long bone the vascular fibrous tissue is condensed into a kmd of membrane caUed the endosteum. The periosteum serves a double purposeâ€”(a) from it the compact tissue of the shaft receives its principal blood supply; and (&) by it the shaft of the bone increases in thickness, while the medullary canal is bemg hoUowed owi; in fact, the entire shaft of the permanent bone is produced by the periosteum, for the part originally formed in cartilage is all removed to form the medullary canal. The bones increase in length by progressive ossification of the layers of cartilage which intervene between the ends of the shaft and the epiphyses; growth continues, therefore, as long as the cartilage remains unossified. Sometimes, from an injury causing separation of the epiphysis, or setting up simple or tubercular inflammation, one epiphysis may unite sooner than its fellow of the opposite limb and in this way one limb will gradually become shorter than the other; this is of special importance in cases of injuries to the hip joint in young people (up to eighteen years). But bones also ..row slightly in length by interstitial deposit; this is weU seen i-n cases of interstitial ostitis attacking a bone during the growing period In this way one limb gradually becomes longer than its fellow; the bone is usuaUy at the same time thickened, as well as lengthened, from the presence oi periostitis ^ but the periostitis, while it accounts for the tMcIcemng, could not account for the

BONES OF THE LEG. â€¢ 115 formeil into a hejwl, with a flat surface on its inner side (Fig. 63), is firmly united to tlic tibia. Its lower end forms the outer ankle, which is lower and farther back than the inner (Fig. 64). Fig. CA. Ankle-joint: tarsal and tarso-metafcii-sai articulations. External view, right side. The patella, or knee-pan (Figs. 31 and 63), is a Hght but strong bone, of the figure of the heai't as painted on playuig-cards, placed at the fore part of the joint of the knee, and attached by a strong ligament to the tibia, the motions of which it follows. It is lodged, when the knee is extended, in a cavity formed for it in the femur (Fig. 63); when bent, in a cavity formed for it at the fore-part of the knee (Fig. 63, 5). The foot consists of the tarsus, metatarsus, and toes. The tarsus, or instep, is composed of seven strong, irregular-shaped bones, disposed like those of the carpus, in a double row (Fig. 64). The arrangement of the tarsal bones is such as to form an arch, the convexity of which above, constitutes the upper surftice of the instep (Fig. 64) : in the concavity below are lodged the muscles, vessels, and nerves that belong to the sole. The metatarsus consists of five bones, which are placed parallel to each other (Fig. 64), and which extend between the tarsus and the proper bones of the toes (Fig. 64). Their extremities, especially next the tarsus, are large, in order that they may form seciu-e articulations I 2

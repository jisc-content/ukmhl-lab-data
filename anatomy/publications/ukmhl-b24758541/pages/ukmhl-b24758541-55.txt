PROGRESS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AND HAPPINESS. 31 not perceived by, or which do not impress others, at length descries the next in succession; this brings into view new analogies, and so prepares the way for the discernment of another link; this again elicits other analogies which lead to the detection of other links, and so the chain is lengthened. And no link, once made out, is lost. Chemists tell us that the adjustment of the component elements of water is such, that although they readily admit of separation and are subservient to their most important uses in the economy of nature by this very facility of decomposition, yet that their tendency to re- combination is equal, so that the quantity of water actually existing at this present moment in the globe is just the same as on the first day of the creation, neither the operations of nature, nor the purposes to which it has been applied by man, having used up, in the sense of destroying, a single particle of it. Alike indestructible are the sepa- rate truths that make up the great mass of human knowledge. In their ready divisibility and their manifold applications, some of them may sometimes seem to be lost; but if they disappear, it is only to enter into new combinations, many of which themselves become new truths, and so ultimately extend the boimdaries of knowledge. What- ever may have been the case in time past, when the loss of an impor- tant truth, satisfactorily and practically established, may be supposed possible, such an event is inconceivable now when the art of printing at once multiplies a thousand records of it, and, with astonishing rapidity, makes it part and parcel of hundreds of thousands of minds. A thought more full of encouragement to those who labour for the improvement of then* fellow-beings there cannot be. No onward step is lost; no onward stej) is final; eveiy such step facilitates and secures another. The savage state, that state in which gross selfishness seeks its object simply and directly by violence, is past. The semi-savage or barbarous state, in which the grossness of the selfishness is somewhat abated, and the violence by which it seeks its object in some degree mitigated, by the higher faculties and the gentler affections of our nature, but in which war still predominates, is also past. To this has succeeded the state in which we are at present, the so-called civilized gtateâ€”a state in which the selfish principle still predominates, in which the justifiableness of seeking the accomphshment of selfish purposes by means of violence, that of war among the rest, is still recognized, but in which violence is not the ordinary instrument em- ployed by selfishness, its ends being commonly accomplished by the more silent, steady, and permanent operation of institutions. This state, Hke the preceding, will pass away. How soon, in what precise mode, by what immediate agency, none can tell. But we are already in possession of the principle which will destroy the present and in- troduce a better social condition, namely, the principle at the basis of

11 PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. #ier than the right (Fig. 86, 7), the CEsophagus opens by an aperture it. The food passes slowly along the oesophagus, urged towards the stomach, not by its own gravity, but by a force exerted upon it by the tube itself, chiefly by the contraction of its circular fibres, Dehvered at length to the stomach, the food is incapable of returning into the oesophagus in consequence of the oblique direction in which the oesopha- gus enters the stomach, the obliquity of its entrance serving the office of a valve. The stomach is a bag of an irregular oval shape (Fig. 86), capable in the adult of containing about three pints. It is placed trans- versely across the upper part of the abdomen. It occuj^ies the whole epigastric, and the greater part of the left hypochondriac regions.

Fig. 6fi, View of the muscles that bend the thigh. 1, the muscle called psoas; 2, the muscle called iliacus ; 3, tendons of these muscles, going to be inserted into the trochanter minor of the femur. The knee is a hinge-joint, admitting only of flexion and extension, and is, therefore, provided only with two sets of muscles, one for bending and the other for extending the leg. The flexors of the leg arise from the under and back part of the pelvis, are seated on the back part of the thigh, and are inserted into the upper part either of the tibia or of the fibula (Fig. 67). They consist for the most part of three muscles, named the semi-tendinosus, the semi-membranosus (Fig. 67,3), and the biceps of the leg (Fig. 67, i). The tendons of the tw^o former muscles, in passing to be inserted into the leg, form the inner, and that of the latter the outer, hamstrings (Fig. 67, 4, 5). Four large muscles, blended together in such a manner as to form one muscle of prodigious size, termed the quadriceps cruris (Fig. 67, 7), occupying nearly all the fore part and the sides, and a con-

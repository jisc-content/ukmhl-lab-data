OKIGIN OF NEKYE FIBRES-MULTIPOLAR CELLS. 341 continued in a transverse direction into the grey matter of the ante- rior horn by two fasciculi, one of which passes between the multipolar ganglionic cells, without uniting with their rays, extends to thÂ« ante- rior commissure, and finally passes into the anterior column of the opposite side of the cord, thus, according to him, producing a true decussation; whUe the filaments of the other fasciculi, taking no part in this decussation, enter the column^ of the cord, where they curve upwards, and appear as longitudinal fibres." The course of the fibres of the posterior root, as described by this observer, is essentially the same. Professor Vanderkolk, of Utrecht, who appears to have devised an improved method of preparing specimens for the microscopical exami- nation of these delicate and complex structures, has given in great detail the results of his laborious investigations, which for the most part confirm the correctness of the preceding representations. By hardening portions of the cord by means of certain chemical agents, and placing exceedingly fine sections of the hardened parts in a satu- rated solution of carmine in spirit, the component parts of the cord are rendered more readily distinguishable from each other; the grey matter becomes clear; the nerve filaments are rendered more distinctly visible, their edges becoming sharper; the multipolar cells are coloured red; the axis cyhnder of the nerve tubules is also coloured red, but not their outer walls, which remain white ; the connective tissue and the blood-vessels are also coloured red, the latter being distinguished from nerve filaments by strongly marked edges. When very fine sections thus prepared are brought under the micro- scope and magnified one hundred times, both horns of grey matter, according to this investigator, are seen to abound with multipolar cells ; those in the anterior horn, however, being decidedly the largest and most abundant. The great facts estabhshed by these researches are, that the multi- polar cells, on the one hand, give off filaments which pass directly into the nerve roots; while the nerve roots, in then* turn, enter into the cells, " In a very successful preparation," says the author, " from which a drawing was taken, the passage of the nerve filaments into the cells was clear to demonstration, while the origin of the anterior nerve roots fi"om cells was so evident as to leave no room for doubt on the subject." As far as regards the fibres of the anterior root, he considers it as demonstrated that they take their origin in the multipolar cells of the grey matter of the anterior horn. With reference to the fibres of the posterior root, he states, in accordance with preceding observations, that they consist of two sets ; one of which, on entering the cord, immediately curves upwards, pro-

He was then immediately put mto a warm hath at 95° Fahr., and kept there half an hour: he complained of being weak and faint, and when reweighed had gained half a pound. Experiment HI.—June, 4, 18o7. Day clear, with some wind. Temperatm-e 60° 5'. Robert Bowers . William Mullins . Charles Cahell . John Kenny . Brj'an Glynon John Haley . Benjamin Faulkner Michael Griffiths. John Broderick . John Didtlerick . The two last men worked in a very hot place for one hour and ten minutes ; all the rest worked about one hour. Michael Griffiths, as soon as he had finished his work, wsis put into a bath at 98°, where he remained half an hour. He was reweighed on coming out of the bath, and had lost 8 oz. From these observations it appears that, towards the end of Novem- ber, when the the temperature of the external aii' was 39°, and the day was foggy and without wind, the greatest loss did not amount to 3 lbs. (2 lbs. 15 oz.), the least loss was 14 oz., and the average loss was 2 lbs. 3 oz. In the middle of the same month, when the temperature of the air was 60° and the day was clear with muc h wind, the greatest loss was 4 lbs. 3 oz., the least loss was 2 lbs. 8 oz., and the average loss was 3 lbs. 6 oz. In June, when the temperatui-e of the external air was 60°, and the day exceedingly bright and clear, without much wind, the greatest loss was 5 lbs. 2oz., the next greatest loss was 4 lbs. 14 oz., the least loss was 2 lbs,, and the average loss was 2 lbs. 8 oz. The same individuals lose very difierent quantities at different times. Thus, James Finnigan in the first experiment lost 3 lbs. 6 oz., in the second 2 lbs. 8oz. Michael Griffiths in the first experiment lost 2 lbs. 8 oz., in the second 2 lbs. 6 oz., and in the thiixl 3 lbs. ; while John Kenny in the first experiment lost 2 lbs. 9 oz., and in the third ex- periment, which was the second to which he was subjected, he lost very neariy the same, namely, 2 lbs. 10 oz. On the other hand, Bryan Glynon in the first experiment lost 4 lbs. 3 oz., and in the third experi-

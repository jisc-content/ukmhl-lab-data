46 PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. parallel to each otlier in strong bundles, and these are gathered too-ether into the cords of tendon, or woven into sheets of membrane. In either situation the fibres run princij^ally in the direction where the strain is greatest, and are connected together by other weaker fibres which run across them. The character of the component fibres is the same as in the areolar tissue, to be presently noticed. They are fine sinuous filaments arranged parallel in little bundles, and are pro- duced from the original cells, most of which, m the progress of develop- ment, elongate and divide up into fine fibres (Fig. 11), whilst some remain in the form of star-shaped communicating cells, as is also the case with areolar tissue.

The membranes above alluded to—fasciae as they are called—are found of all degrees of thickness and strength, from such dense sheets of fibrous tissue as enclose the muscles of the thigh to the most slender films, which pass without limit into true areolar tissue (Fig. 12), a substance which, whilst it is composed of the same minute formative element, has not any determinate shape, but is loosely spread about and between the organs. This is an important

THIGH-BONE. 113 Left hip-ji)int laid opcii. i Passing obliquely downwards and outwards from the ball, is that part of the femur which is called the neck (Fig. 62). It spreads out archlike between the head find body of the bone, and is more than an incli in length. It is thus long, in order that the head of the bone may be set deep in its socket, and that its motions may be Avide, free, and unembarrassed. From the external surface of the femur, nearly in a line with its axis, at the root of its neck proceeds upwards the largest and strongest bony process of the body, which gives insertion to its most powerful muscles, namely, those that extend the thigli and that turn it upon its axis (Fig. 31) ; because, from its oblique direction, it rotates the thigli; this process is called the trochanter, and from its size, the trochanter major. At the under and inner part of the neck on the posterior sur- face of the bone, is a similar process, but much smaller, called the tro-

The bones of the leg, two in number, consist of the tibia (Fig. 31) and fibula. The tibia, next to the femur, the longest bone in the body, is situated at the inner side of the leg. Its superior extremity is bulky and thick The top of it forms two smooth and slightly concave surfaces, adapted to the convex surfaces of the condyles of the femur (Fig. 63, 4, 2). On its outer side there is a smooth surface, to which the head of the fibula is attached (Fig. 63, g). Its lower extremity, which is small, forms a concavity adapted to the convexity of the bone of the tarsus, called the astragalus, with which it is articulated (Fig. 64). Its inner part is produced so as to form the inner ankle; its outer side is excavated into a semilunar cavity, for receiving the under end of the fibula, which forms the outer ankle (Fig. 64). The fibula, in proportion to its length the most slender bone of the body, is situated at the outer side of the tibia (Fig. 31). Its upper end,

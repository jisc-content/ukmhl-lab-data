ORIGIN OF THE CEREBRAL NERVES. 353 2. The second pair, the optic, arise from the optic thalami and tubercles (Fig. 107, 2), advance into the orbits, penetrate the eye- balls, and expand into the retinae, and so constitute the organ of vision. I'isr. 107. Base of the brain. 3. The third pair, the motores occuli, or motors of the eye, arise from the crura cerebri, between the corpora albicantia and the pons varolii (Fig. 107, 3), and passing into the orbits, are distributed to most of the muscles that move the eyeballs. 4. The fourth pair, trochleares or pathetici, arise from the optic tubercles (corpora quadrigemina) (Fig. 107, 4), pass round the crura cerebri, penetrate the orbit, and are entirely spent upon the two muscles, the oblique, which roll the ball of the eye. 2 A

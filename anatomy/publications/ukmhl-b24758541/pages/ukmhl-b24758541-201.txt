CALCULATIONS. 167 amount by taking the average of their observations. The following are the results of the principal experiments which have been instituted. The quantity of oxygen consumed by an adult man in twenty-four hours is, according to Menzes .... 51,840 cubic inches. Lavoisier. . . . 46,048 „ Davy .... 45,504 Allen and Pepys . . 39,534 ,, The mean of all which is, 45,731.5 inches. In like manner the quantity of carbonic acid generated in the same time is, according to Davy . . 38,304 cubic inches. Allen and Pepys . 38,232 The mean of which is . . 38,268 The weight of 38,268 inches of carbonic acid gas is 18,130.1474 grains troy; and the weight of 45,731^ inches of oxygen is 15,757.9131 grains troy. Now this weight of oxygen must have been derived from the decomposition of 221,882 cubic inches of common atmospheric air. It has been shown that, in the state of health, one contraction of the heart propels to the lungs two ounces of blood; that this action ot the heart is repeated 72 times in one minute ; that to every four actions of the heart there is one action of respiration; that consequently there are 18 respirations in a minute, and 25,920 in the twenty- four hours. From these premises it results that at each action of the heart there is decomposed of the air inspired, 8.5603 cubic inches, that is, a quarter of a pint within one-tenth of a cubic inch,—the quarter of a pint imperial measure being 8.6648 cubic inches. Previous observation had assigned one pint as the volume of air ordinarily inhaled at a single inspiration. We now see that the quantity decomposed is a quarter of a pint. It is, then, true, that of the whole volume of air inspired, one-fourth part only is decomposed, and that three-fourths, after having been diffused through the air vesicles of the lungs, are expired without change. Observation had also assigned 12 pints of air as the volume con- stantly present in the limgs,—that is, . . 415.9108 cubic inches. The truth seems to be, that forty-eight times the quantity decomposed is constantly present, namely, 410.8926 cubic inches. The difference is only . . . . 4.0182 cubic inches, which difference weighs less than 1| grains troy. It is then concluded that the real contents of the lungs is a volume of 410.8926 cubic indies, which is exactly the 540th part of 221,882

Moreover, by virtue of their vital power, these muscles act with an efficiency which a mere ligamentous band is incapable of exerting ; for they apportion the strength of resistance to the separating force, and react with an energy proportioned to the violence applied. The bones of tlie fore-arm are two, the ulna and tho radius (Figs. 31, and 53, 5 and 7). When one looks at the palm of his own hand, the radius is on the outer, and the ulna on the inner side of the fore-arm. The larger end of the ulna is at the elbow, whilst the larger end of the radius is at the WTist. The upper ends of these bones are, for the most part, on the same level, but the top of the ulna grows up behind into a stout

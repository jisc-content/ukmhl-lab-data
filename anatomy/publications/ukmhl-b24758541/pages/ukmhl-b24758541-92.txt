PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 68 influence to many muscular fasciculi. The anatomical relation between the nerves and the muscular fibres is thus very completely made out; their physiological relation is much less perfectly known; yet, to a certain extent, that relation has also been clearly develoj)ed. This will be more fully shovm when an account is given of the structure and function of nerves. Tissue, in its earliest stage of formation, is seen to consist of a mass of nucleated cells, which first arrange themselves in a linear series, Fig. 29. Fig. 30.

As this union of the cells goes on, a deposit of soUd matter—contractile material—gradually takes place within them, commencing in the inner surface, and advancing towards the centre, until the whole is soHdified. As soon as soHd matter is deposited in the cells, indi- cations of a regular arrangement of the granules are apparent. ' It is common for the longitudinal lines to become well defined before the transverse ones. Both are always strongly marked at birth When the nuclei of the cells, which were before visible, disappear, they can still be shown to exist by immersion in a weak acid, which sweUs the

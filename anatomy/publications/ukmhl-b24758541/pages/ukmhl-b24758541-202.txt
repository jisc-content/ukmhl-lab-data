PHILOSOPHY OF HELVLTH. 168 cubic inches, being the whole volume decomjjosed in twenty-four hom-s. But 160 seconds is also exactly the 540th part of the number of seconds in twenty-four hours. Of the whole weight of oxygen consumed in twenty-foui- hom-8 ....... 15,757.9131 grains, the 540th part, or the proportion of 160 seconds, is . . . . . . 29.18132 „ and 410.8926 cubic inches of atmospheric an*, which, as above, is the contents of the lungs, contain of oxygen the same weight . . . . .29.18132,, Then, if respiration were suddenly stopped, provision is made by the quantity of air always retained in the lungs for the oxygenation of the blood while flowing at the ordinary rate of 72 strokes jDer minute? for the exact sj^ace of 160 seconds, and for not one instant longer. This interval of time, then, as has been stated, is very probably the time in which the blood performs one circuit, not 150 seconds. Then 540 cu'cuits are perfontned in the twenty-fom' hours, or 3 circuits in every eight minutes. From this estimate has been deduced the quantity of blood contained in the whole body of the human adult. The air inspired in twenty-four hours contains as under :— Undecomposed, and to be re- turned unclianged . To be decomposed, containing iu solution [Pure atmospheric air . . . j Vapour of water .... t Carbonic acid gas .... Bulk ill cubic inches.

This is, in bulk, 25,607|- imperial pints, or 57 hogsheads 1 gallon and 7J pints, and in weight 571;^ ounces and 25 grains. Now, although the ah* expired, in consequence of its recomposition, may have undergone changes in bulk, yet it seems agreeable to all analogy to suppose that its weight will remain the same as the weight inhaled. This, however, is not asserted as a truth, but only assumed, in order to show the result of such a theory. Then the air expired m twenty-four hom-s will be as follows :— Given out undecomposed as before Kecomposed carbonic acid gas Azote hberated. Vapour of water as before Bullf in cubic inches. 665,646 38,268 165,927 2,219 Weight in grains troy. 205,758.833 18,130.147 50,027.405 428.726 Total 872,060 274,345.111

PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 240 One of these elementary bodies may exist as a simple organ, or many may be collected into a mass to fonn a comjDound organ. Wlien single they are called sohtaiy ; when collected into a mass, aggregated. Follicles aggregate by imiting at their oiifices, and tubuli by joining and becoming tortuous or convoluted (Fig. 95). When a single elementary body, as a folhcle, forms a distinct secreting organ, the matter secreted is elaborated at the inner surface of the organ, and is contained within its cavity. When needed it quits this cavity at the orifice of the folUcle, on the application of the appropriate stimulus. But in the more complex arrangements of these bodies, where the elementary bodies are aggregated into dense, thick masses, when layer after layer of these masses, containing myriads of myriads of folhcles or tubuli, are superimposed one upon another, it is impossible that each individual body can have a separate orifice. In this case a minute tube springs from each body; and a comj)lete connexion is established between all the individuals composing the mass by the free intercommunication of these tubes. Of these tubes the minutest unite together, ^ and fonn larger branches ; these larger branches again uniting form still larger branches, until, by their suc- cessive union, the branches form at length a single trunk (Fig. 96), with which all the individual branches, whether great or small, communicate, and into which they all pour ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ their contents; the common T ""^^^^^^"T"" trunk formed bv their union Intimate structure of a composite gland (the paro- â€¢ , i ,, *^ tid): a salivary. IS termed the excretory duct. The secretmg canals contain the secreted matter; the excretory duct collects this matter, and conveys it to the part of the body in which it is appropriated to the specific purpose which it seiwes in the economy. The basis of the secreting canals consists, then, of membrane dis- posed m one or other of the elementary forms described These secretmg canals constitute a pecuhar system of organs wholly cHfferent from all the other organs of the body. The form of these orc^ans their structure and then- relation to the blood-vessels and nerves liave formed subjects of laborious investigation and of keen controversy during several centuries. The honour of discovering the exact truth on these points is due to very recent researches. Professor Miiller, of Berlin, has investigated the structm^e of the

Cells acquire and exercise the following functions :— 1. The function of absorption : they draw into their interior through their permeable walls portions of the formative fluid by which they are surrounded (blastema). 2. The function of secretion: they act variously on this common matter so as to form out of it products widely different from each other. 3. The function of assimilation: they appropriate part of the matter they absorb to their own nourishment and growth. 4. The function of reproduction: they in- crease in number as well as size, an object which they accomplish in one or other of the following ways: At one or two points of the external surface of a full-grown cell, minute projections or sprouts make their appearance (Fig. 8, h). These prove to be young cells, which rapidly develop into perfect cells. This is well seen in the yeast plant, when placed in contact with a solution of sugar or infusion of malt, and observed under the microscope. The simple ovoid cell soon begins to sprout (Fig. 8, h); each sprout develops into a young cell, and a, single cells ol' yeast plant; b, cells beginning to sprout; c, a row of full- tlicse, whcu full grown, givc to the plant the ap- grown cells adhering to- „ , - _ . -I- gether, and forming a necklace appearance. pcarance of a necklace (Fig. 8, c) A contraction takes place in a full-grown cell (Fig. 1, c), by the gradual enfolding of the primordial utricle; the

PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 170 twenty-four hours, the 48th part of the first, and the 160th part of the last product is equally the 540th part of the whole, whatever it may be. I3ut if the time in which a cii'cuit of the blood is performed be, as is most evident, identical with the time in which the whole volume of aii' in the lungs is decomposed, and if such period of time were, as the old observers have assigned, 150 seconds, then it would follow that only 45 times the quantity of air decomposed at a breath is present in the lungs, amounting to 385i cubic inches, and that the whole blood in the body is 24 ounces less than on the suj)position of 160 seconds, that is to say, only 360 ounces, or 22^ pounds avoirdupois. Because the 45th part of 18 x 60 x 24 is the same as the 150th part of 60 x 60 x 24 ; in each it is the 567th part of the whole. From the whole of these observations and calculations the following- general results are deduced:â€” 1. The volume of air ordinarily present in the lungs is very nearly twelve pints. 2. The volume of air received by the lungs at an ordinary inspira- tion is one pint. 3. The volume of air expelled from the lungs at an ordinary expi- ration is a very little less than one pint. 4. Of the volume of air received by the lungs at one inspii-ation, only one-fom-th part is decomposed at one action of the heart. 5. The fourth part of the volume of air received by the lungs at one inspiration, and decomposed at one action of the heart, is so decomposed in the five-sixth parts of one second of time. 6. The time in which a circuit of blood is performed is identical with the time in which the whole volume of air in the lungs is decom- posed. 7. The whole volume of air decomposed in t^\^enty-four hours is 221,882 cubic inches, exactly 540 times the volume of the contents of the lungs; 160 seconds being also exactly the 540th jmrt of the number of seconds in twenty-four hours. 8. The quantity of the blood that flows to the lungs to be acted upon by the air at one action of the heart is two oimces. 9. This quantity of blood is acted upon by the air m the five-sixth parts of one second of time. 10. One circuit of the blood is performed in 160 seconds of time. Three circuits are performed every eight minutes; 540 circuits are performed in the twenty-four hours. 11. The quantity of blood in the whole body of the human adult is 24 pounds avoirdupois, or 20 pints imperial measure. 12. In the space of twenty-foui" houi's, 57 hogsheads of air flow to the lungs.

Fig. 48. ^'Rl ANCU ARI S STCRNI A transverse section of the thorax, showing the relative positioD of tlio viscera, and the reflections of tiie pleura;. The anterior surface of the pericardium, the bag which envelopes the heart, lies immediately behind the sternum, and the cartilages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, covered at its sides by the pleura, and firmly attached below to the diaphragm (Fig. 47). Surrounded by its pcricardiimi, within the mediastinum, the heart is l^laced nearly in the centre of the chest; but its direction is somewhat oblique, its apex being directly opposite to the interval between the fifth and sixth ribs on the left side ; while its basis is directed up- wards, backwai'ds, and towards the right. That portion of its sm-face which is presented to view on opening the pericardium is convex; but its opposite surface, namely, that which rests upon the part of the pe- ricardium which is attached to the diaphragm, is flattened. It is fixed in its situation partly by the pericardium and partly by the great vessels that go to and from it. But under the different states of expiration and inspiration, it accompanies, in some degree, the move-

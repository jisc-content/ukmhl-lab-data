PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 242 1. Because it is not analogous to the ordinary oj^erations of nature to mix wholly excrementitious matter with a substance for the produc- tion, elaboration, and perfection of which, she has constructed such an expensive apparatus. 2. Because, on the other hand, the admixture of matter already highly animalised with matter, as yet but imperfectly animalised, exalts the natui'S of the latter, and is conducive to its complete animahsation. 3. Because the lymph, almost wholly albuminous, is already closely allied in natm-e to the blood; it is, therefore, reasonable to infer, that it is matter passing through an advancing stage of purification and exaltation. 4. Because this plan of progressive organisation is in harmony with the ordinary operations of nature, in which there is traceable a suc- cessive ascent from the low to the high, the former being preparatory and necessary to the latter. The tender and delicate organs of animal Hfe, the brain, the nerves, the apparatus of sense, the muscles, inasmuch as they perform the highest functions, probably require to be constructed of a more highly organised material, for the production of which the matter primarily derived from crude aliment is subjected to different processes, rising one above the other in dehcacy and refinement; by each of which it is made successively more and more perfect, until it acquii-es the highest qualities of living substance, and is capable of becommg the instrument of performing its most exalted functions.

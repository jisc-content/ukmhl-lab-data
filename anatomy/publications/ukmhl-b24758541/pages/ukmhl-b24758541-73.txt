BONE.â€”HAVERSIAN S^YSTEMS. 40 with their concentric lamellae they are denominated Haversian systems. When the Haversian canals unite, the surrounding concentric layers also meet and blend together.

Between the lamellae around any Haversian canal are placed, at regular intervals, oval cavities called Jacunae (Fig. 14, c), and these oval cavities are flattened between the layers, and from their flat surfaces they give off very fine wavy root-like canals called canaliculi, which pass through the lamellae and often reach and join the root-like off'sets from the neighbouring lacunae; those from the lacunar which are nearest to the central canal opening into its in- E

In front and at the back of the joint are very thin ligaments, which are connected with the nmscles that pass over them, so as to be held off the ends of the bones in their movements, and kept by this beautiful provision from being pinched between them. The ujoper and lower ends of the bone of the fore-arm are in contact, but their shafts 2)art away from each other, and are connected by a band of strongly woven membrane (Fig. 56) ; the rounded upper end of the radius fits in a con- cavity on the side of the ulna above, wdiilst conversely, the rounded lower end of the ulna fits to a concavity on the side of the radius below, and at the jilaces of contact the ends are covered with cartila2;e. and connected bv ligaments to form joints. Whilst the upper end of the radius turns on its own axis in a ring (Fig. 56), formed partly by the ulna and partly by a liga- mentous collar, the low^er turns on the rounded end of the ulna. It is in this way that the radius, by its lower end, which carries the mist and hand, moves round the lower end of the ulna, de- scribing a semicircle, whilst the back or palm of the hand is tmned forward at will, the upper end in the elbow-joint being all the while stationary, and only rotating on its axis. The hinge-like joint of the elbow^ admits of two movements only—flexion and extension. The muscles which execute joint, showing anterior and internal 4-l,„c.^ r^^r^-rr^-^-.^ ,a i-j j ,-i ligaments. movements constitute the cliief bulk of the upper arm— the two flexors placed on the front of the bone and the extensors on the back.

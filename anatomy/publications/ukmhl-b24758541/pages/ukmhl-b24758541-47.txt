23 INTELLECTUAL AND SYMPATHETIC PLEASUKES. have been uncultivated, do they awaken either emotions or ideas; the clown sees them, hears them, feels them scarcely more than the herds he tends : yet in him whose mind has been cultivated and unfolded, how numerous and varied the impressions, how manifold the com- binations, how exquisite the pleasm-es they produce ! And from the more purely intellectual operations, from memory, comparison, analysis, combination, classification, induction, how still nobler the pleasure! Not to speak of the happiness of him who, by his study of natural phenomena, at length arrived at the stupendous discovery that the earth and all the stars of the firmament move, and that the feather falls to the ground, by the operation of one and the same physical law; nor of the happiness of him who sent his Idte into the cloud, and brought down from its quiet bed the Hghtning which he suspected was slumbering there ; nor of the happiness of him who concentrated, directed, and controlled that mighty power which has enabled the feeble hand of man to accomplish works greater than have been feigned of fabled giant; which has annihilated distance; created, by economising, time; changed in the short space in wliich it has been in operation the surface of the habitable globe; and is destined to work upon it more and greater changes than have been eftected by all other causes combined ; nor of the happiness of him who devoted a longer life with equal success to a nobler labour, that of KEAKING THE FiUSEIC OF FELICITY BY THE HAND OF IlEASON AND OF LAW;â€”in the ordinary intellectual operations of ordinary men, in their ordinary occupations, there is happiness. The intellectual pleasures of such men as Newton, Franklin, Watt, and Bentham, can be equalled only by those who possess equal intellectual power, and who put forth equal intellectual energy: to be greatly happy, as they were, it were necessary to be as highly endowed; but to be happy, it is not necessary to be so endowed. Every human being whose moments have passed with winged speed, whose day has been short, whose year is gone almost as soon as it seemed commenced, has derived from the exercise of his intellectual faculties pleasures countless in number and inestimable in value. But the sympathetic pleasures, out of which grow the social, are of a still higher order even than the intellectual. The pleasures that result from the action of the organic organs, from the exercise of the several senses, and from the operation of the intellectual faculties, like the sensations in which they arise, belong exclusively to the individual being that experiences them, and cannot be commimicated to another. Similar sensations and pleasures may be felt by beings similarly constituted; but the actual sensations and pleasures afforded by the exercise of a person's own organs and faculties, are no more capable of becoming another's than his existence. These, then, are

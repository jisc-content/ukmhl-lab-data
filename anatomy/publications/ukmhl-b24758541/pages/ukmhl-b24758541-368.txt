PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 332 creatm-es, and their welfare is secured as much by what is exdnded as by W'hat is inchided, by the precise limit set to sensation and volition, as by the introduction of these faculties at all. Had the action of the heart, for example, been voluntary and sensible, life must have been spent in attending to it; the occupation must have been exclusive, and ^\^thout intermission. Every step in every movement of the body from place to place must have required a distinct effort of the mind ; the approach of almost every foreign body would have excited terror; there could have been no sleep and no rest. The convenience and pleasure of existence, nay, even existence itself, depend on the unin- terrupted action of the heart: it is, therefore, made to work without consciousness, without fatigue, and without the necessity of continuous rest. And yet had the heart been rendered wholly insensible: had the stomach, the liver, the intestines, and all the other vegetative organs, been so constructed as to carry on their processes without any kind or degree of sensibility, one main source of the pleasure and the safety of life must have been lost. But by joining in inseparable miions sentient with insentient nerve fibres, and by making the insentient greatly pre- dominate in the vegetative organs, a certain amount of sensibility is communicated as these processes go on, not amounting to distinct, dis- criminative sensation, but yet producing that indistinct, that pleasur- able consciousness which is felt in every fibre of the frame in sound and vigorous health; while by the same admirable arrangement, when any considerable deviation from the state of health occurs, warning is given of the danger, and pain is made the minister of safety. Thus are the two lives blended together that they may work in harmony, and thus the foundation of j^leasurable existence is laid in the action of the primary and fundamental processes of life. %

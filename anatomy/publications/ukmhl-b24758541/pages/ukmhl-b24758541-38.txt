14 PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. In the advancing series, the- animal is superadded to the organic life; sensation, the lowest faculty of the animal life, precedes ratiocina- tion, the highest. The senses called into play at the moment of birth soon acquhe the utmost perfection of which they are capable; but the intellectual faculties, later developed, are still later perfected, and the highest the latest. In the descending series, the animal life fails before the organic, and its nobler powers decay sooner and more rapidly than the sub- ordinate. First of all, the impressions which the organs of sense convey to the brain become less numerous and distinct, and con- sequently the material on which the mind operates is less abundant and perfect; but at the same time, the power of working vigorously with the material it possesses more than proportionally diminishes. Memory fails ; analogous phenomena are less readily and less com- pletely recalled by the presence of those which should suggest the entire train; the connecting links are dimly seen or wholly lost; the train itself is less vivid and less coherent; tmin succeeds train with pretematm-al slowness, and the consequence of these growing imper- fections is that, at last, induction becomes unsound just as it was in early youth ; and for the same reason, namely, because there is not in the mental view an adequate range of individual phenomena; the only difference being that the range comprehended in the view of the old man is too narrow, because that which he had learnt he has forgotten; while in the youth it is too narrow, because that which it is necessary to learn has not been acqmred. And with the diminution of intellectual power the senses continue progressively to fail: the eye grows more dim, the ear more dull, the sense of smell less dehcate, the sense of touch less acute, while the sense of taste immediately subservient to the organic function of nu- trition is the last to diminish in intensity and correctness, and wholly fails but Avith the extinction of the life it serves. But the senses are not the only servants of the brain; the voluntary muscles are so equally; but these ministers to the master-power, no longer kept in active service, the former no longer employed to convey new, varied, and vi^dd impressions, the latter no longer employed to execute the commands of new, varied, and intense desbes, become successively feebler, slower, and more uncertain in then: action. The hand trembles, the step totters, and every movement is tardy and un- steady. And thus, by the loss of one intellectual faculty after another, by the obHteration of sense after sense, by the progressive failure of the power of voluntary motion; in a word, by the declinino' enerfy and the ultimate extmction of the animal life, man, from the state of maturity, passes a second time through the stage of childhood back to that of infancy; lapses even into the condition of the embryo: wiiat

In the dentine we find very numerous fine tubes, with proportionately thick walls, running through a structureless intermediate substance, and all alike radiating from the central cavity toAvards the surface of the tooth: as they pass along their coiu-se is wav}-, and they divide (Fig. 18, a) and send oft'branches as they go, mitil finally they reach Fig. 18.

Of man. the enamel or crustra, where they often end in little cavities, or a few stretch into the substance of the crustra, and there become continuous with the canaliculi of its bony structure. The vessels of the tooth do not extend into these fine tubes, which, like the canaliculi of bone, form a system of fine canals throughout the dentine wherefrom the flow of blood is excluded, but along which a fluid is cba-sATi fi'om the blood-vessels fit and sufficient for the nourishment of the hard tissue in their vicinity. The enamel is constructed of cells, charged -mill lime: these cells are adherent in rows perpendicular to the surface; the hues themselves are slightly sinuous, and the whole is compacted so closely as to confer on the enamel its adamantine hardness.

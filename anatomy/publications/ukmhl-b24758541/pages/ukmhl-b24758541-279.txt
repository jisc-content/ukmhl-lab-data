ELEMENTARY FOliMS. 245 brain, form simple continuous, serous, secreting siu-faces. On the contrary, mucous membrane is never disposed in this perfectly simple mode; even when it forms a continuous surface, as in the lining, which it affords to the alimentary canals, it is more or less plaited into folds or rugae. 2. The second disposition of membrane in the construction of the secreting apparatus, is the depression of it into a minute pit, called a crypt, which is sometimes rounded to form a cell. 3. Next, the cell, instead of being rounded, is elongated into a Fig. 94. 2 12 2 1 Poition of the skin and cellular tissue, showing the sebaceous follicles, as seen under tho microscope very highly maguitied. 1, the external surface of the follicles with the blood-vessels ramifying upon it; 2, follicles laid open, showing the interior cavity iiito which the secreted Huid is poured. peduncle or neck, not unlike the neck of a bottle (Fig. 94). This pedunculated vesicle is called a follicle. 4. And, lastly, the pit itself is elongated; so that instead of pre- senting the appearance of a pouch, it rather resembles a tube (Fig. 95), and is accordingly named tubule. Fig. 95. Minute structure of large intestine. In the construction of the secreting apparatus, membrane, then, may be said to be disposed into three elementary forms constituting crypto or cells, follicles, and tubuli. Membrane, disposed into these elementary forms, constitutes the simple bodies by the accumulation and the varied arrangement of which the compound organs are com- posed. There is no other known element which enters into the com- position of the most complex secreting organ.

The second great division of the body, termed the trunk, extends from the first bone of the neck to that called the pubis in front, and to the lower end of the coccyx behind.

The thorax or chest extends above from the first rib, by which it is connected with the nock, to the diaphragm below, by which it is divided from the abdomen (Fig. 41). It consists partly of muscles and partly of Iwnes : the muscular and the osseous portions being in nearly

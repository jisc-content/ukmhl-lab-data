156 PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. the cartilages which continue them onward ascend toward the breast- bone, to which the upper seven are attached (Fig. 41), In consequence of this conformation and arrangement of the ribs, eveiy degree of motion which is communicated to them necessarily influences the capacity of the space they enclose. In ascending they carry forward the breast-bone, and so increase the measm'e of the chest fi'om before backward, whilst from the combination of outward with doAvnward curvature in their arrangement, the muscular force pulling along the upper edges causes them to twist outward as they ascend, an effect which is rendered possible through the yielding of the cartilage which connects them to tlie sternum : by the outward movement of the convexity of each rib the chest is widened fi'om side to side, and as the length of the curve increases, and the degree of cm-vature augments from above downwards (Fig. 41), this widening is greatest at the lower part of the chest. Thus the respii'atory movement of the thorax results in an expansion of the chest in all directions, increasing evenly towards its lowermost part. Fig. 80. View of tlie intercostal muscles which fill up die interspaces between tlie l ibs. These muscles consist of a double layer oi' fibies, the external and the internal, which cross or intersect each other. The muscles by which these motions of the ribs are effected in ordinary inspiration connect the adjacent bodies of the ribs, and are called intercostal (Figs. 41 and 80); they extend obliquely from rib to rib in two layers, the outer of which run downwards and forwards, whilst

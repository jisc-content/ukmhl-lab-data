PKEFACE. VIU In that name may I thank all those, whether known to me or not, who, whilst he who bore it was still amongst us, gave him their valuable assistance in his labours, especially that old and trusted friend with whom he read over much of the book whilst still in manuscript, whose ready sympathy gave him so much pleasure, and whose time and energy so much important assist- ance. I mean R. D. Grainger, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.C.S., for a long period Lecturer on Physiology at St. Thomas's Hospital. I also take tliis opportunity of thanking those friends who, since the work has been in my hands, have shared my desire tliat it should be brought out in an adequate manner, and who have in various ways furthered the accomplishment of this object. My obligations in this respect are very great towards Thomas Baker, Esq., of the Inner Temple, Barrister-at-Law. The plates in the present edition are principally new, many of those which originally belonged to the work having been found unsuitable, in consequence of the new light which has been tlirown on physiology, and the fresh matter requiring entirely new illus- tration. Let me say, in conclusion, that I have felt deeply the respon- sibility that has rested upon me while endeavouring to make this edition all that its author would have wished. I, who was with him always, know how great his own interest in it was, and I would hope that the solemn charge intrusted to me has not been, to any great extent, neglected. My grandfather had but one object in life: all he did tended towards it. May this, his early and his last work, forward that objectâ€”the diffusion of such knowledge of the laws of health as shall lead to an increase of the mental and moral power of his fellow-creatures.

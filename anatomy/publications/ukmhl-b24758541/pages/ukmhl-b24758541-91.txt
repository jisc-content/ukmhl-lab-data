SUPERADDED TISSUES—NERVES. 67 most abundantly to the striped. It has been shown that in aggregating to form a muscle, the fibres are collected into smaller and larger packets. For these packets the areolar tissue often forms an external investment, and even sends septa into the intervals between tliem. The different packets are capable of acting independently of each other; and on watching carefully a muscle in motion in a living animal, it is seen that some of the packets are in active contraction while others are at i*est. The areolar tissue, in which the different packets are enclosed, enables them to move independently of each other, and thus facilitates the performance of their function. Tlio density of these geneml and partial sheaths is proportioned to the amomit of the pressure to which the indi-\ddual muscle may be subject. The entire muscle is often included in areolar tissue, and is always supplied with ^' nerves and blood-vessels of large size and great abundance. Blood-vessels.—Muscular tissue, as just stated, is abundantly supplied with arteries and veins. These com- monly run together, there being generally two veins to one artery. The larger trunks pass more or less ^ chrectly across the fibres. They di- vide and subdivide, first in the inter- vals between the larger packets, tlion between smaller sets, and, lastly, the ultimate twigs insinuate themselves between the fibres composing the smallest bundles, where they break (.^,^5,1^^,.^ ^,^,^3^,,^ ,,,^,^^1^^^^^^^,^;^^^ up into their terminal or capillary times, a, artery; b, vein; c, Ciipilliwy branches (Fig. 28). The capil- laries unite together, open freely into each other, and by their inter- lacements they form a delicate elongated net-work. Nervous tubules pass, like the vessels, between the different packets of fibres, following the course of the capillaries, to the smallest packets. They touch the sarcolemma, but they never penetrate it, so that the fine sarcous matter is as completely guarded from the direct contact of nerves as from blood-vessels. Though the nerves accompany the blood-vessels they do not follow them in their last windings, for they termmate in a diff'erent figure (Fig. 29). They end, not in points, but in loops. They are much smaller than the smallest pri- mitive fibres, and therefore one nervous loop must carry the nervous F 2

98 PHILOSOPHY OF HKALTH. vex surftice sustains the powerful muscles that extend the thigh; and along its internal surface is the prominent line which marks the brim of the pelvis, and which divides this cavity from that of the abdomen. The ischium is the lower part of the pelvis (Fig. 31) ; at its undermost portion is a rounded prominence called the tuberosity, in its natural coridition covered -with cartilage, upon which is super- imposed a cushion of fiat. It is the part on which the body is supported in a sitting posture. The pubis or share bone forms the upper and fore part of the pelvis (Fig. 31), and together with the two former bones, completes the large and deep socket, termed the acetabulum (Fig, 31), into which is received the head of the thigh bone. The margin of the acetabulum and the greater part of its internal surface is lined with cartilage, so that in its natural condition it is much deeper than it appears to be when the bones alone remain. The lower aperture of the pelvis, which appears large when all the soft parts are removed, is not really large, for in its natural state it is filled up partly by muscles and partly by ligaments, which sustain and protect the pelvic organs, leaving only just space enough for the passage to and from those which have their opening on the external surface.

' The cavity of the pelvis, together with all the organs contained in it, are lined by a continuation of the membrane that invests the abdomen and its contents.

PIIILOSOrilY OF HEALTH. 'MO aud intricate, that it seems at first view difficult, if not impossible, to describe the organ in an intelligible manner. The difficulty is in- creased by not having the object itself before us. Still, by considering only the fundamental parts, and by the aid of diagrams, it is practi- cable to convey a clear and correct conception of its organisation to any one who will give due attention to the subject. Without some know- ledge of its structure it is quite impossible to understand its functions. It will be convenient to commence the description of the more interior and fmidamental parts of the brain by an account of the position and relation of the several bodies that are placed at its base, following them in their order upwards, from the sjjinal cord to the cerebral hemispheres and the layers of the cerebellum. 1. On the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata are visible two flattened bands or cords, which occupy its centre (Fig. 109), and which have been already described under the name of the anterior pyramids (Fig, 110, in section). As they ascend these bands gradu- Fig. 110. Fie. 111. fosffriTr JFtsstire, Antsrior TittuT^ Jtefttiform TSo^if Anterior Ptfrnmitl Transverse section of medulla oblonoatn.

At the sides of the pyramids, and in immediate contact with them, are two other bodies, projecting considerably, which, from their supposed resemblance to olives, are called the olivary bodies (Fio-s 109 and 110, in section). â€¢

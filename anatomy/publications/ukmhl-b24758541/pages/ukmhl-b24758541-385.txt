TONE OF THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 349 raised, and by another entirely different movement is expanded to receive the food; how the larynx, wliich stands immediately before tlie pharynx, is at the same time firmly closed to prevent the food from passing into the lungs instead of the stomach; how, the instant the morsel is transmitted over the glottis and touches the pharynx, this organ gi-asps it, contracts forcibly upon it, and propels it into the oesophagus ; and how the ojsophagus, in like manner, contracts upon it and forces it downwards, while the cardia, the guardian of the stomach, usually firmly closed, opens to give it free passage into the stomach. Here a multitude of muscles, difierently constructed, occupying different situations, performing different actions, some the direct reverse of others, are made to produce combined, successive, co-ordinated movements for the accomplishment of a definite purpose. In the ful- filment of this purpose every one of these muscles must act at a given time, with a certain force, in a fixed order; failure of any one of these muscles, in any one of these particulars, may disturb the func- tion, may defeat it altogether, may prove instantly fatal. Daily, hourly, tliese motions take place without the slightest consciousness on the part of the individual that any such motions are going on within lum. That they should go on with such regularity, in such harmony, appears inexplicable. The mystery is solved in part on the suppo- sition that there is established an apparatus of exciter and motor nerves in connection with a corresponding apparatus of muscles; and that the simple contact of a physical agent—a morsel of food, a drop of water—with the exciter or incident nerves suffices to set the rest of the mechanism in action, the incidental nerve conveying a definite impression to its nervous centre, and the nervous centre sending out by a reflex nerve a force which stimulates the muscles with which it is in relation to a definite series of motions. There is still another function performed by the spinal centre essen- tial to the well-being of animal life; it is the primary source of what is called the tone of the muscular system. In health the muscles are maintained in a certain state of perma- nent contraction, quite different from the occasional active contractions of the voluntary muscles and the rhythmetrical contractions of the involuntary muscles. It is a state common to the entire muscular system, in which especially the physical properties of the muscular tissue are maintained in their due force and balance; when, if a muscle be touched, it offers a certain degree of resistance; if it be removed from its natural position, it is drawn back again of its own accord with a certain recoil; and if it be stimulated, it contracts with a certain degree of energy: a state in which the physical properties of firmness and elasticity, together with the vital property of excita-

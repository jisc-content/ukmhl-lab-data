CALCULATIONS. 1G9 weighing as before, but less in bulk by 446| pints : so that for every 100,000 inches expired there were inspired 101,774 cubic inches. When from the weight of carbonic acid gas thus Grains. expured, viz., 18,130.147 we deduct the small portion inhaled in solution with the air 105.130 The remainder is .... 18,025.017 The constituent parts of which are oxygen derived from the air 13,109.104 And pure carbon derived from the blood being the difference . . . . . .4,915.913 Thus in the compass of twenty-fom- hours the blood has produced 10 ounces and 116 grains very nearly of pure carbon. Now, from the oxygen consumed in twenty-four hours Grains, as above ....... 15,757.913 Deduct the weight restored in the form of carbonic acid gas . . . . . . . . 13,109.104 The remainder must have been absorbed into the blood . 2,648.809 But the weight of carbon given out being as above . 4,915.913 There is still an excess given out weighing . . . 2,267.104 Some azote, however, is absorbed into the blood as well as the above ascertained quantity of oxygen. The weight of azote so absorbed must be precisely . 2,267.104 if the theory be ti-ue, that equal weights are expired and inspired. In which case, as the weight of the azote of the air inspired was, as shown above . . . 52,294.509 While the azote expired could only have weighed . . 50,027.405 The difference would have been absorbed . . . 2,267.104 And thus the weight of carbon discharged by the blood is precisely compensated by the united weight of the oxygen and azote which it has absorbed. Since it appears to be a general truth that one quarter of the air respired is decomposed, and that the volume of air continually present in the lungs is sufficient for that consumption of oxygen which is requisite m 160 seconds of time, if that volume he, as is apparent, 48 times the quantity decomposed out of a single respiration, no error in the quantity of oxygen consumed m the twenty-four hours, which we have assumed, will affect the time of 160 seconds. For there being 18 X 60 X 24 respirations, and 60 x 60 x 24 seconds of time in the

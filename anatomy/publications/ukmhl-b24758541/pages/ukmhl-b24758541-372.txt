Dura -J^at^^T* rtttetlLecyer ^ ยง far, indeed, from adhering to the vertebrae, the periosteum is separated from them by a layer of fat and areolar tissue, Avhich sun'ounds it in its whole course, thus acting as an elastic cushion. The cord is suspended and maintained in its position in a remark- able manner. Proceeding from each side of the cord to the Theca Vertebralis, to which it is attached by a number of pointed processes (Fig. 103) like the teeth of a comb, there is a delicate but firm mem- brane, which derives its name from these tooth-like processes, and is hence called the denticulated ligament (ligamentum denticulatum). This membrane suspends and steadies the cord in the centre of its bony canal, just as if it were sustained in a sling. At the lower part of the vertebral canal the Theca ends in a number of strong elastic cords, which are attached to the last bone of the column, the os coccygis, and these, hke the stay ropes of the mast of a vessel, fix and firmly hold the cord vertically, as the denticulated liga- โข ments do laterally. 4. A fourth contrivance for the protection of the cord is a very subtle and unexpected one. It has just been stated that the arachnoid membrane lies loosely upon the Pia Mater. Between the two membranes there is a considerable space (Fig. 104), wdiich is occupied by a very remarkable fluid of signal importance. It is termed, from its position be- neath the arachnoid, the sub- arachnoid fluid. It consists almost entirely of water; that is, out of 100 parts upwards of 98 are pure water, the remaining two parts consisting of small quantities of alkaline substances, as soda, potass, and lime, together with minute portions of animal matter, principally albumen and osmazone. This fluid, which is very considerable in quantity, extends the whole length of the vertebral canal, and, as there is no division between the vertebral and cranial cavities, the fluid passes freely from the former into the latter, where it occupies precisely the same relative situation; and hence, being common to both cavities, it is fm-ther called the cerebro- spinal fluid. In the living body it is not stagnant. It is in a state of constant, gentle oscillation, so that in a lining animal it may be seen to rise and fall with the movements of the chest m resphation. That it may be defended from all injurious contact with the bony walls of the canal in which it is encased, and that it may be farther protected from concussions propagated through these walls, the cord is slung by the Trmisverse section of the spinal cord and its membranes.

A serous membrane lining the internal surface of the dura mater, and I'eflected over the entire surface of the brain, termed the arachnoid tunic. 7. A thin and delicate membrane in immediate contact with the substance of the brain, descending between all its convolutions, called the pia mater. 8. An aqueous fluid, contained between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Skin, muscle, pericranium, bone, dura mater, arachnoid membrane, pia mater, and aqueous fluid, superimposed one upon another, form, then, the covering and defence of the brain ; so great is the care taken to protect this soft and tender substance.

65 FIBRILSâ€”SAIiCOUS ELEMENTS. fibrils must have their dark centred cubes just on the same level. Thus, the fibrils, or the discs, consist of parts precisely alike; in the tudinal striiE.

" To detach a fibril entire is to remove a particle from every disc, and to take away a disc is to abstract a particle of every fibril." These little cubical particles are called "sarcous elements," and are surprismgly constant in their magnitude in creatures of every size; they are as small in the elephant as in the microscopic rotifer. They are united with each other as they lie side by side in the fibres, and the fibre itself is enclosed in a fine, transparent membrane allied to the basement membrane (Fig. 27, a). It is of extreme tenuity, but very tough and elastic. It forms for the fibre a sheath, or rather a perfect tube, in which the tender sarcous matter is lodged, and by which it is sustained, protected, and isolated from all other substances. The nature and office of this membranous tube are expressed by its name. It is called Sareoleinma, from two Greek words signifying flesh, and bark or tegument, because it encloses the fibre of the muscle just as the bark encloses the trunk of a tree. Among the sarcous elements are always to be discerned a number ol corpuscles, which are conceived to be the nuclei of the colls h-om which I'

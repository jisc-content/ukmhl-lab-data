59 SUBSTANCES IN BLOOD; ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY. middle : they are constantly poured into the blood by the chyle and lymph, and when they enter the blood, they either pass into the higher form of red particles, or perform some special office and then perish. The general opinion is that they form the ^. ^4 red particles by a successive process of evolution and transformation; passing pro- ^ gressively from a globular shape, the primi- &^ tive one of all organic cells, to a flattened and ^ f§\ elliptical form, their contents being gradu- <. ^ ^ « ^"^^ ally converted into the pecuhar matter ^ ^ /©\ ^ contained in the red cells.

Consist chiefly of chlorides of sodium and potassimn, but several other substances, earthy and animal, are also found m minute quantity. Their use is to prevent the decomposition both of the blood and of the substances that are formed out of it; to maintain the fluidity of the fluids, and the solubility of the sohds, and to supply the earthy and mineral materials requu-ed in the system. Arterial and venous hlood.—Arterial blood contains less carbonic acid than venous in the proportion of from 20 to 25 per cent, of its volume; a httle more hydrogen, less albumen, and more fibrin; a gi'eater number of red cells, and, above aU, it is distinguished by its bright scarlet colour, as contrasted with the dark purple of venous blood. Froportion of solid matter in the hlood.—Taking together all the solid substances contained in the blood, they form from 200 to 210 parts in 1000. Specific gravity of the hlood.—It must, therefore, be of greater specific gravity than water, the average in health being from 1050 to 1055, or perhaps 1059. The specific gi-avity is somewhat greater in men than in women, on account of the greater nmnbcr of red particles in the former; while the quantity of albumen and fibrin is pretty much the same in both. It is essential to the integrity of the blood that the relative specific

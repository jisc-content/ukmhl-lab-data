125 CHAMHRHS OF THE HEART. the ventricle like columns or pillars (Fig. 71, muse. pa[)ill.), lieuce they are called fleshy columns (columnar carnea3). Some of these fleshy columns are adherent by one extremity to the wall of the ventricle, while the other extremity terminates in tendinous threads, which are attached to the membrane that forms the valve. From the upper and right side of this chamber springs the pulmo- nary artery (Fig. 71), at the entrance of which are placed three mem- branes of a crescent or semilunar shape, termed the semilmiar valves. The structure of the left side of the heart is perfectly analogous to that of the right. Its auricle, like that on the left side, is placed at the base of the ventricle (Fig. 71), and like it also is thin, being composed chiefly of membrane. At its upper and back part are the openings of the four pulmonary veins, two from the right, and two from the left lung. Fig. 71. The left auricle and ventricle laid open, the anterior walls of botli being removed. At the passage of communication between the left auricle and ven- tricle is placed a valve analogous to that on the right side. The walls of the left ventricle are nearly as thick again as those of the right, and its fleshy columns are much larger and stronger. From

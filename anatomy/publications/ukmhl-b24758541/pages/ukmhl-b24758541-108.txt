No vertebra, except the first, rest immediately upon its contiguous vertebra (Fig. 42). Each is separated from its fellow by a substance of a peculiar nature interposed between them, termed the intervertebral substance (Fig. 44). This substance partakes partly of the nature of cartilage, and partly of that of ligament. It is composed of concentric plates, formed of oblique fibres, which intersect each other in every direction. This substance, for about a quarter of an inch from its cir- cumference towards its centre, is tough, strong, and unyielding; then it becomes softer, and is manifestly elastic; and so it continues until it approaches the centre, when it becomes pulpy, and is again inelastic.

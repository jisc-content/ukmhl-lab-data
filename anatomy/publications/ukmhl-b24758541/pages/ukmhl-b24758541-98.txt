The union of the boiles of the cranium affords an example of an immoveable articulation. Prominences and indentations, like the teeth of a saw, are formed in the margins of the contiguous bones (Fig. 36). At these inequalities of surface, which are exactly adapted to each other, the two bones are in immediate apposition in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of motion, and even to render the separation extremely difficult. This mode of articulation is termed a suture. There are certain advantages in con- structing the cranium of several distinct bones, and in uniting them in this peculiar mode. 1. The walls of the vault are stronger then they could have been had they been formed of a single piece. 2. In the foetus, the bones are at some distance from each other (Fig. 38); at birth, they yield and overlap one another ; and in this manner they conduce to the security and ease of that event. 3. Minute vessels pass abundantly and securely through the interstices of the sutures to and from the interior of the cranium; in this manner, a free communi- cation is established between the vessels within and without this

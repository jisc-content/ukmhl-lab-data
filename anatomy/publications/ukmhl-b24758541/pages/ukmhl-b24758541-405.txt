INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN. 369 grey substance, which so completely envelops the white, that it is commonly said to surround it as the bark does the inner parts of a tree ; and hence it has derived the additional name of the cortical substance. Fig. 109. The columns of the medulla oblongata, and their connection with the cerebrum and cerebellum. The inner parts of the brain consist ofâ€”1. A vast, and, at first view, a confused mass of white medullary matter. When in a per- fectly natural state it presents to the naked eye but little appearance of a fibrous or tubular structure. It is so soft and delicate that it requires the utmost care and skill to discover and exhibit its true anatomical characters. 2. Certain masses composed of a structural combination of tubular and vesicular neurine. These masses form distinct bodies, which possess a definite figure and size, and are placed in a regular series along each side of the median plane, and extend from the medulla oblongata to the white substance of the hemisjjheres. 3. Extended masses of various figures and sizes, con- sisting chiefly of tubular neurine, having a definite and varied struc- ture, and forming an apparatus of union, which consists of two sets of fibres, one set uniting the opposite and symmetrical halves of the brain, and the other the component parts of each hemisphere. The structure and relations of the individual parts of the brain, especially when considered as forming a united whole, are so complex 2 B

PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 284 monary transpiration relate to the quantities lost at the ordinary external temperatures in which the human hody is jjlaced. The quantity lost when the hody is exposed to an elevated temperature is prodigiously increased. It did not occur to the physiologists, whose experiments have been detailed, to ascertain this by causing themselves to be accm-ately weighed immediately tefore they entered their heated chamber and immediately after they left it. Having heard that the loss daily sustained by the workmen employed in gas-works is very extraordinary, I endeavom'ed to ascertain the amount of it with exactness. This I was enabled to accomj^lish by the assistance of Mr. Monro, the manager of the Phoenix Gas Works, and of Mr. Cooper. The following are the experiments by which this has l^een ascertained. Experiment I.—November 18, 1836, at the Phoenix Gas Works, Bankside, London. Eight of the workmen regularly employed at this establishment in drawing and charging the retorts and in making up the fires, which labour they performed twice every day, commonly for the space of one horn-, were accurately weighed in their clothes immediately before they began and after they had finished their work. On this occasion they continued at their work exactly three-quarters of an hour. In the interval between the first and second weighing, the men were allowed to partake of no solid or liquid, nor to part with either. The day was bright and clear, with much wind. The men worked in the open air, the temperature of which was 60° Fahr. The barometer 29 - 25' to 29^ 4'. Michael Griffiths John Kenny . John Ives. James Finnigan .

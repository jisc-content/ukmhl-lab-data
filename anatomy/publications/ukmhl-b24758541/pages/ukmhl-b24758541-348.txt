314 PHILOSOPHY OF Hr:ALTH. but when a foot appears, as in the scallop (Pecten), then a new ganglion, the pedal, is added. The common earth-worm moves by a series of motor rings, to each of which a ganglion is appropriated. In the Julus terrestris there are 92 pairs of legs and 92 ganglia. In another genus (Chyoni bregmatus) there are no fewer than 160 legs, and these are supplied by ICO gangha. In insects which undergo metamorphosis, as the butterfly, moth, and so on, there are in their rudimentary state—that is, in the state of larva—13 motor segments, and here there are 13 ganglia. But in the process of metamorphosis the prologs and some other parts disap- pear or are thrown off, and their ganglia either coalesce or are absorbed. When the insect acquu'es its full ^^erfection, its nervous system is con- centrated, in accordance with a general law, and in the imago there are only 9 ganglia. Fig. 101. Nei vous system of an insect (Carabus of tlie gardens). A beetle. Wherever there are eyes there are optic gangha; in creatui'es without eyes there are no such ganglia. In the higher animals the size of the gangha which supply the sensory apparatus is proportionate to the acuteness of the senses, as is seen in the large size of the olfactory gangha in animals distinguished for the acuteness of their smell, and in the optic ganglia in those which possess the most perfect vision. The inteUectual faculties are developed, as their instrument, the gi-ey matter of the brain, is accumulated and concentrated. The enormous bulk of the convolutions of the human brain, which consist almost entirely of gi-ey matter distinguishes it from the brain of the lower animals more than its comparative size. The comparatively small quantity of grey matter in the human brain at birth, as contrasted with the vast mass of it which is deve- loped at matui-e age, is also very remarkable In the new-born infant

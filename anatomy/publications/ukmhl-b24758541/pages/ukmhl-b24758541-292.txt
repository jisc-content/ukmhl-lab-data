258 PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. her operations a step or two; but in every case, at a certain point, tlie apparatus itself becomes so delicate as to elude our senses, and then of course we are necessarily at a stand. So, the rough materials with w^iicli she carries on her great work of secretion, by careful analysis we can separate into divers parts, and ascertain that each part possesses peculiar properties. The main channels by which she conveys these varied constituents to the different parts of the system we can trace ; the delicate organs by which she produces on these rude materials her wonderful transformations we can see; but beyond the threshold of these organs we cannot go. Why from one common mass of fluid the same variety of peculiar substances are constantly separated, and each in its respective place: why the kidney never secretes milk, nor the liver mine, nor the breast bile: why membrane, and muscle, and bone, and fat, and brain, are uniformly deposited in the same precise situation : why these depositions go on with imiformity, constancy and regularity; and by what laws each process is controlled and modified, we do not know. But though with whatever dUigence we investigate these operations, the great problem remains, and probably ever will remain unresolved, still it is both a pleasurable and a profitable labour to follow Nature in her path, to the extreme point to which it is possible to trace her footstep; for the phenomena themselves are often in the highest degTee curious and interesting; while their order and relation can seldom be so considered as to be understood, without the suggestion of practical applications of great and permanent usefulness.

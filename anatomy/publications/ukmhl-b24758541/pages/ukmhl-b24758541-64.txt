Fig. This is termed, from the physiologist who first described it, the Primor- dial utricle of Mohl. As it is spread uniformly over the whole internal surface of the cell-wall (Fig. 1, l), it must of course enclose all the other contents of the cell. Those other contents are, first, a quantity of pellucid semifluid or- ganic matter, and secondly, two minute more solid bodies embedded in this fluid, the largest of which is called the nucleus (Fig. 3, h), and the smallest, contained within the first, the nucleolus (Fig. 3, c). These bodies give name to the cells, which are called nu- cleated cells. The fluid in which these bodies are embedded is a nitrogenous substance, a protein compound, in plants of a muci- laginous, in animals of an albuminous character; in both holding in suspension a considerable proportion of oils, a fatty matter combined with earthy and saline salts, and some animal ingredient. Its chemical composition is essentially the same in all classes of organized beings. As it is conceived to be the material from which cells derive their origin and support, it is called " germ substance," or blastema, a, cell membrane; b, nucleus c, nucleolus ; d, nucleoli.

^ a 2 DEDICATION TO OEIGINAL EDITION. TO LORD BROUGHAM. My Lord, The interest and part you took in tlie effort that was made to establish in the University of London a professorship of the branches of science treated of in this work, have made me desirous of connecting your name with this attempt to give to them a still more popular exposition than was at that time contemplated. Excepting as a qualification for the practice of surgery and medicine, in the curriculum of no school or college in the kingdom is an explanation of the structure and functions of the human body included. As a qualifica- tion for no profession or pursuit, in the curriculum of no school or college in England is an explanation of the phenomena of the hitman mind, and of the laws that govern the formation and direction of its intellectual and moral powers, included. The omission of these subjects from the ordinary courses of education cannot be because they are without interest, nor because nothing worthy of being communi- cated lias been discovered respecting them, nor because there is insuperable difficulty in the exposition of what is ascertained. Since the mind is the subject upon which all education is intended ultimately to act, and the instrument thi'ough which it must efiect whatever influence it exerts, no one can doubt the importance of an acquaintance with the mental phenomena and with the laws that regulate them. Of the knowledge of the processes by which the structures of the body are built up, and of the physical conditions which are necessary to their life, health, and strength, the utility is not so obvious; yet such knowledge is capable of practical applications of the utmost importance daily and hourly, I have shown elsewhere the usefulness of this knowledge to the individual; but there are professional men, exclusive of the surgeon and physician, to whom, in the daily performance of their proper and peculiar business, it would prove of special advantage, among whom may be reckoned the barrister, the judge, the magistrate, and the legislator. By the three former the grossest errors aflecting property, health, the questions of innocence and guilt, and even life itself, have been and are committed, through their absolute and total ignorance of everything relating to this subject; and how is it possible that the legislator should be able to form a rational judgment of measui-es tending to improve or deteriorate the public health (a matter which can be deemed of no light importance when viewed in relation to all the subjects that directly and indirectly afiect the physical strength and the longevity of the community), while he is in a state of total darkness in regard to every process and condition on which life and health depend ?

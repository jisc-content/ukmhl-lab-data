Larger particles of a darker coloui-, collected into groups, are here and there intennixed with them, and are called pigmental particles (Fig. 100). The nerve-vesicles, like nucleated Fig. 100, Large cells of the grey hiyor of the cortical substance of the human cerebellum.

Most of them are simple spherical cells, but many present offshoots, or pro- cesses, called caudate or tail-like processes (Fig. 100). A single vesicle may produce one or several of these elongations, and, according to the number they send off, they are termed uni-, bi-, or multi-polar vesicles (Fig. 100). This form of nervous substance abmmds in all the nervous centres, and also, as has been lately discovered, in the peripheral expansions of some of the nerves of sense, as in the retina, and at the terminations of the olfactory and auditory nerves. On the other hand, the white substance, to the naked eye, looks perfectly homogeneous and structureless, something like a slice of cream-cheese. It is, however, really made up of an assemblage of minute threads or fibres (Fig. 100), and this fibrous structure forms its essential character. There are, then, two elementary forms of nervous matter, one con- sisting of molecular substance and of vesicles, and the other of threads or fibres; the first being appropriately called vesicular and the other fibrous, as indicating their more obvious forms. These two substances variously arranged and combined, form the several organs of the system. The really djoiamic part of nervous substance is the molecular grey

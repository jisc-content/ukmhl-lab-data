26 PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. pathetic preponderates over the selfish, how vast the increase of the pleasm-e! And when matured, exalted into afi'ection—aflection, that holy emotion which exerts a transforming influence over the selfish part of human nature, turning it into the sympathetic; afi'ection, which renders the happiness of the beloved object dearer to the heart than its own; afi'ection, among the benignant feelings of whicli as there is none sweeter so there is none stronger than that of self-devotion, nay, some- tunes even of seK-sacrifice ; affection, which is sympathy pure, concen- trated, intense—Oh how beautiful is the constitution of this part of our nature, by which the most transporting pleasures the heart receives are the direct reflection of those it gives ! Nor ought it be overlooked, that, while nearly all the selfish, like all the sensual pleasures, cannot be increased beyond a fixed limit, cannot be protracted beyond a given time, are short-lived in proportion as they are intense, and satiate the appetite they gratify, the sympathetic plea- sm"es are capable of indefinite augmentation; are absolutely inex- haustible ; no limit can be set to their number, and no bound to their growth; they excite the appetite they gratify; they multiply Avith and by participation, and the more is taken from the fountain from whicli they flow, the deeper, the broader, and the fuller the fomitain itself becomes. But not only is the mental state of affection in all its forms and degrees highly pleasurable, but the very consciousness of being the object of affection is another pleasure perfectly distinct from that arising immediately from the afi'ection itself. It has been said of charity, that it is twice blessed, that it blesses alike him that gives and liim that receives; but love has in it a threefold blessing: first, in the mental state itself; secondly, in the like mental state which the manifestation of it produces in another; and thirdly, ui the mental state inseparable from the consciousness of being the object of affection. And this reflex happiness, this happiness arising from the consciousness of being the object, is even sweeter than any connected with being the subject of affection. In like manner there is pleasure in the performance of beneficent actions; in energetic, constant, and therefore ultimately successful exertions to advance the great interests of human kind, in art, in science, in philosophy, in education, in morals, in legislation, in govern- ment ; whether those exertions are put forth in the study, the school, the senate, or any less observed though perhaps not less arduous nor less important field of labour. Exertions of this kind beget in those for whom, towards those by whom, they are made, benignant feelings —respect, veneration, gratitude, love. With such feelings the philo- sopher, the instructor, the legislator, the statesman, the philanthropist, knows that he is, or that, sooner or later, he will be regarded by his

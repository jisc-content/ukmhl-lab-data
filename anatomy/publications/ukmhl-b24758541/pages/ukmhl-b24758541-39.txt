15 PROGRESS OF DEATH. the foetus was, the man of extreme old age is: when he began to exist, he possessed only organic life; and before he is ripe for the tomb, he returns to the condition of the plant. And even this merely organic existence cannot bo long maintained- Slow may be the waste of the organic organs ; but they do waste, and that waste is not repaired, and consequently their fimctions languish, and no amount of stimulus is capable of invigorating their faihng action. The arteries are rigid and cannot nourish; the veins are re- laxed and cannot carry on the mass of blood that oppresses them; the lungs, partly choked up by the deposition of adventitious matter, and partly incapable of expanding and collapsing by reason of the feeble action of the respiratoiy apparatus, imperfectly aerate the small quantity of blood that flows through them; the heart, deprived of its wonted nutriment and stimulus, is unable to contract with the energy requisite to propel the vital current; the various organs, no longer supplied with the quantity and quality of material necessary for carrying on their respective processes, cease to act; the machinery stops, and this is death. And now the processes of life at an end, the body falls within the dominion of the powers which preside universally over matter; the tie that linked all its parts together, holding them in union and keeping them in action, in direct opposition to those powers dissolved, it feels and obeys the new attractions to which it has become subject; particle after particle that stood in beautiful order fall from their place; the wonderful structures they composed melt away; the very substances of which those structiu-es were built up are resolved into their primitive elements; these elements, set at liberty, enter into new combinations, and become constituent parts of new beings; those new beings in their turn perish ; from their death springs life, and so the changes go on in an everlasting circle. As far as relates to the organised structures in which life has its seat, and to the operations of life dependent on those structures, such is its history ; a history not merely curious, but abounding with practical suggestions of the last importance. The usefulness of a familiar acquaintance with the phenomena which have now been elucidated wiU be apparent at every step as we proceed.

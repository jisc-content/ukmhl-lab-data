PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. CHAPTER I. Characters by -which living beings aro distinguished from inorganic bodies—Cha- racters by wliich animals are distinguished from plants—Actions common to plants and animals—Actions peculiar to animals—Reasons wliy the structure of an animal is more complex than that of a plant. Every one can distinguish between a plant and a stone, and between an animal and a plant, but the real differences between them are not known to every one, and are not obvious without reflection. In a plant and animal certain movements take place, as the motion of the sap in a plant, and of the blood in an animal, which do not exist in a stone. These movements are produced by a definite me- chanism ; that is, by certain structures adapted and designed to accomphsh a given result, as in the case just referred to, the circula- tion of the sap and of the blood. The apparatus or instrument is termed an organ, and the action of an organ is termed its function. Organisation is the building up of organs. A body furnished with organs is organised. When in the exercise of its organs it is alive. The action of its organs is its life. Living beings are organisms. Nothing enters into their composi- tion which does not perform or minister to the performance of a function. The roots, leaves, and flowers of a plant; the heart, brain, and stomach of an animal, are so many organs, to each of which a definite office is assigned. These, taken together, constitute the being, and their action comprises its life. Hence the possession of organs is one character by which an organised being is distinguished from an in- organic body. The organs of which a living bemg is composed consist of a union of fluid and solid parts. An inorganic body may be entirely gaseous, B

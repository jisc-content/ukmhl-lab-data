152 PHILOSOrHY OF HEAT/rH. tition the epiglottis is carried completely over the glottis, partly because it is necessarily forced backwards, when the tongue passes backwards in delivering the food to the pharynx, partly because it is carried back- wards by certain minute muscles which act chrectly upon it, and partly through the movement of the larynx, which is brought upwards and forwards beneath it. The moment the action of deglutition has been performed the epiglottis springs from the aperture of the glottis, by the return of the tongue, &c., to their former position. During the act of speaking the column of air which is expelled from the lung, which rushes through the glottis, and which thus forms the voice, strikes against tlie epiglottis, and the voice becomes thereby in some degree modified. Tit. View of the trachea, sliowing, first, the division of the tube into the right and left brondius, and the subdivision of the bronchi into the bronchial tubos ; and, secondly, the mem- branous and cartilaginous tissues of which the organ is composed. The trachea (Fig. 77, 2) is a tube with firm and substantial ^\a\h. It is kept always open to admit of the constant passage of air to and from the lungs. For this purpose its walls have horizontal bars of cartilage imbedded within them at short intervals. These embrace a sufficient portion of its circumference, but do not quite sm'round it, because they would then prevent any variation of its calibre, such as is sometimes necessary, for instance, in coughing, where the narrowing of the tube increases the force of the rush of air upwards. The rings are in the front and sides of the trachea; but the back part (Fig. 78, 7) is membranous in its structure, and is composed of muscle and elastic tissue in addition to the common supporting fibrous membrane which is present throughout the whole tube-wall. The muscle runs for the most part horizontally, connecting the ends

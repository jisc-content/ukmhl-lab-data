51 BONEâ€”STRUCTURE OF THE TEETH. thus their effectiveness for injury is most favourahly lessened. In the shafts of the long bones, which, as we said before, are always com- posed of the hai'dest material, the provision of lightness is effected by Fig. 16. A Fig. 17.

The ivory of teeth offers us a modification of the osseous structm-e. Every tooth is composed of three substances (Fig. 17), ivory or dentine, enamel, and crustra petrosa, the stony crust of the fang. Though a tooth is almost solid, it contains a small hollow (Fig. 17, h, h) in its interior, from which a canal runs down its fang or root, and opens at the end of it; this hollow contains the nerves and nourishing vessels of the tooth, which enter into it by the hole at the end of the fang. The ivoiy (Fig. 16, d) fonns the main bulk of the tooth, constitutes its body, giving to it its natural shape; it is covered outside by a coatmg of either of the other substances, the enamel (Fig. 16, a) covering the crown or free part of the tooth, whilst the stony crust (Fig. 16, e) covers the fang, which is inserted into the pits of the jaw- bone. The crustra petrosa is, in its structm-e, quite like true bone, showing the lacunae and canaliculi proper to it; but the canaliculi of the crustra petrosa (Fig. 18,/, ff) are apt to tissume a dii-ection vertical to the surface of the tooth, and to extend out a very long distance in the crust.

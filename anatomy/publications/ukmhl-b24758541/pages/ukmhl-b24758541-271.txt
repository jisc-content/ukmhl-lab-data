CHANGE OF FOOD INTO BLOOD. 237 tion, tlie albumen is slightly lessened in amount, whilst there is more fibrin, and a largo and increasing number of round globules are found, which much resemble, on the one hand, the corpuscles already spoken of as lining the passages of the mesenteric glands, and, on the other, the white corpuscles of the blood, so that they probably are intermediate stages between these. But in the chyle when it reaches the thoracic duct, these principles are so augmented, concentrated, and approximated to the state in which they exist in the blood, that the chyle is now capable of undergoing the characteristic 2^i"0cess of the blood; for as the blood, when drami from a vein, undergoes spon- taneous coagulation, so the chyle, when drawn from the thoracic duct, separates into three parts: a solid substance or clot, which remains at the bottom of the vessel; a fluid which smTounds the clot; and a thin layer of matter, which is spread over the suiface of the fluid. The solid substance is analogous to the fibrin, and the fluid to the serum of the blood; while the layer of matter which is spread over the fluid is of an oily nature: moreover, the chyle, when in contact with the air, quickly changes to a red colour, and abounds with minute particles, the largest of which more than equal the size of the red particles of the blood. The changes wrought upon the food, by which it is thus approxi- mated to the chemical composition of the blood, are effected, as has been shown, partly by the giistric and intestinal juices, and partly by matters combined with the food highly animalised in their own nature, and endowed with assimilative properties, as the salivary secretion mixed wdtli the food during mastication; the pancreatic and biliary secretions mixed with the food during the conversion of the chyme into chyle; and the mesenteric secretions mixed with the elaborated chyle of the mesenteric glands; and, lastly, organised particles which have already formed a part of the living structures of the body mixed with the chyle under the form of lymph in the thoracic duct. The lymph, mitil lately regarded as excrementitious, is really highly animalised, partly combined with the chyle as its last and highest assimilative matter; whence the compound formed by the admixture of chyle and lymph is far more proximate to the blood tlian the purest and most concentrated chyle; and partly returnuig with the chyle to the lungs, to receive there a second depuration, and thereby a higher elaboration. There is evidence that there is a series of organs specially provided for the elaboration of the lymph no less than of the chyle. There are organs manifestly connected with the digestive apparatus, to which physiologists have found it extremely difficult to assign a specific office. These organs have a structure in some essential points alike; that structure is strikingly analogous to the organisation of glands: like

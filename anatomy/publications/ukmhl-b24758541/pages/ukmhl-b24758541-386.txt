PHILOSOPflY OF HEALTH. 350 bility, are maintained in their due force and balance. If the spinal cord be destroyed, all these properties are instantly lost. The muscles become lax and flaccid ; they lose their resihency, and no amount of stimulus can animate them to the slightest degree of contraction. These states coexist or cease with the integrity of the spinal cord: the conclusion is that they have their origin in it, and depend upon it. Such are the main functions performed by the spinal centre, which in their full extent comprehend all the actions concerned in the preservation of the individual and the perpetuation of the species. It has been before observed that the functions of the gangli- onic are closely allied to those of the spinal centre. They are, in- deed, as far at least as regards their modes of action, identical. In both all the actions are insensible, involuntary, automatic; in both they require for their manifestation the presence of an external agent or stimulus; in both they are necessary, definite, and produce a defi- nite result, however complex the means of- accomplishing it. The natm-e of the action of both centres is, therefore, probably the same, but they fulfil different pm-poses. There is a division of labour in the economy. To the ganglionic centre is assigned one part of the work, to the spinal centre another. The spinal centre deals with the intro- duction into the system Of masses of matter; the ganglionic centre operates upon the individual particles. The spinal centre is the medium by which the raw materials necessary for carrying on the various processes of life are conveyed into the body. The ganglionic centre operates on these masses, decomposes them, recombiues them, and distributes them in a due state of preparation to the several organs in which they are to be used up and appropriated for the special pur- poses of the economy.

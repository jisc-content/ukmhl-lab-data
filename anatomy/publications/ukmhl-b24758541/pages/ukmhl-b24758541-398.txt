PHILOSOPHY OF HEALTH. 3(32 Seeing, then, the number of vital organs which this nerve influ- ences, and their absolute dependence on it during every moment of existence, we can understand the reason of the exceptional course which, it has been shown, is taken with respect to the position of this nerve; why, instead of being placed near the organs which it is to animate and govern, which would be low down in the neck or in the chest, it is carried absolutely within the cranium, and so is there rendered safe from the accidents and shocks, to which the vertebral column is so imminently and constantly exposed. The Ninth, Lingual, oe Hypoglossal Nerve.—This nerve is devoted mainly to the tongue. It influences all the muscles which contribute to the manifold movements of this organ. It is pro- bably, in itself, pm-ely motor, though it has a borrowed sensibility from sentient nerves. From its almost exclusive action on the muscles of the tongue it is often called the motor linguae, and the varied and important ofiices of the tongue is indicated by its deriving supplies of nerves from so many difierent sources. The Accessory Nerve.—According to the view stated, this nerve constitutes the motor portion of the imeumogastrie nerve. Whether this be correct or not, it is admitted that the j^neumogastric derives many of its motor fibres from the accessory nerve. Its influence is exerted principally on the powerfid muscles of the shoulder and upper part of the chest, which, besides their ordinary offices, are called out into extraordinary action in energetic and violent acts of respiration. It thus becomes an important respiratory nerve when, from disease or otherwise, the ordinary movements of respiration fail duly to carry on the circulation of the blood through the lungs.

INTEODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION. The object of the present work is to give a brief and plain account of the structure and functions of the body, chiefly with reference to health and disease. This is intended to be introductory to an account of the constitution of the mind, chiefly with reference to the develop- ment and direction of its powers. There is a natural connexion between these subjects, and an advantage in studying them in their natural order. Structure must be known before function can be understood: hence the science of physiology is based on that of anatomy. The muid is dependent on the body: hence an acquaintance with the physiology of the body should precede the study of the physiology of the mind. The constitution of the mind must be mider- stood before its powers and affections can be properly developed and directed : hence a knowledge of the physiology of the mind is essential to a sound view of education and morals. In the execution of the first part of this work, that which relates to the organisation of the body, a formidable difficulty presents itself at the outset. The explanation of structure is easy when the part described can be seen. The teacher of anatomy finds no difliculty in communicating to the student a clear and exact knowledges of the structm-e of an organ; because, by the aid of dissection, he resolves the various complex substances, of wliich it is built up, into their constituent parts, and demonstrates the relation of these elementary parts to each other. But the case is different with him who attempts to convey a knowledge of the structure of an organ merely by the description of it. The best conceived and executed drawing is a most inadequate substitute for the object itself. It is impossible wholly to remove this

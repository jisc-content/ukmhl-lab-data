77 JOHN GORDON, M. D. this condition of the brain in hydrocephalus to be produced by the distending force of the water progressively effused into the ventri- cles, of which Dr Gordon has afforded am- ple proof, by extracts from the Works of Vesalius, Tulpius, Petit, Hunauld, and Morgagni. This doctrine of mechanical distention is revived by Drs Gall and Spurz- heim, who profess farther to have discover- ed the mode in which it is made to act. They maintain, that the brain is in no case disorganized or destroyed, but that the fluid accumulated in the ventricles, by the exer- tion of a gentle, but constant and regular force, acts on the convolutions till their du- plicatures are unfolded and transformed in- to a kind of membranous expansion, white and smooth within, and covered externally by grey matter. This action on the convo- lutions is said to commence at the bottom, where each duplicature of them may be easi- ly separated into two layers; and their fibres, which at first were vertical, are then said to assume a horizontal position.

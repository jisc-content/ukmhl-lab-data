Although Human Anatomy had neces- sarily occupied the greater part of the time he employed in actual dissection, he had al- so studied deeply the structure of other animalsâ€”convinced that the knowledge, which such extended comparisons afford, serves often to relieve physiology from many perplexing difficulties, and to open and clear the way to its most important truths. Of his skill in Morbid anatomy, I have al- ready spoken. No one pursued it with greater zeal, nor estimated more highly its importance in illustrating, not only the dis- eased actions, but the healthy functions, of the system. In truth, these actions and func- tions are but two extreme terms of one and the same series; and if a knowledge of the healthy function best qualify us to estimate the amount and predict the consequences of its deviations, so does correct observation of

JOHN GORDON, M. D. 41 was made with considerable dexterity; and the order pursued in it was so different from that usually followed in this country, that it excited much interest, and impressed many with the belief of great discovery in the ana- tomy of that organ. It cannot be denied, that, even by profes- sional persons in this country, the anatomy of the brain has been studied only in a very general manner; nor is it difficult to assign a reason for it. It is justly observed by the Committee of the French Institute, that â€˜ none of those, who have examined the brain, have succeeded in establishing a ra- tional and positive relation between the struc- ture of that organ and its functions, even those which are most evidently physical; and the discoveries hitherto made known with respect to it, are confined to some cir- cumstances regarding the form, connexions, and texture of its parts.* Hence the study of this organ has not commonly been carried farther than the acquisition of such a know-

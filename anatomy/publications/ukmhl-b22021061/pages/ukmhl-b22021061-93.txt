79 JOHN GORDON, M.D. sufficient to remark, that this is advancing one supposition on another equally ground- less, for such a structure has no foundation in fact; or, even granting that it had, there is no force operating from the ventricles, which could effect the separation of the two layers, without producing laceration of the thick stratum of cerebral substance every- where interposed between the surfaces of those cavities and the bottom of the convolu- tions; yet such laceration is never remarked in hydrocephalus. That there is no loss of substance in a hydrocephalic brain, in any stage or degree of the disorder, as Gall and Spurzheim assert, is maintained to be a po- sition not only without proof, but demonstra- bly incorrect. And as to the argument for that opinion, derived from the circumstance, that persons affected with hydrocephalus have often preserved their faculties for many years, Dr Gordon replies, with the Com- mittee of the French Institute, that as we â€˜ do not know with what part of the brain.

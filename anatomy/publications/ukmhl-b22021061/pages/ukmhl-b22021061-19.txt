JOHN GORDON, M.D. 5 became a student of Natural and Moral Phi- losophy, the former taught, at that time, by the late Mr Robison, and the latter by Mr Dusyald Stewart. . For more than twenty years he delivered Lectures on Materia Medica and Chemistry, in this city, with the great- est applause; and, as well by the Works which he published, as by his Lectures, advanced greatly the sciences which he cultivated and taught. As a teacher of Chemistry, he pos- sessed very peculiar powers. Profoundly skilled in the science, he exhibited unrivalled facility in the communica- tion of it. The ease, clearness, and fluency with which he spoke were truly surprising. There seemed to exist within him a perennial spring of thought, which, with- out effort or parade, poured itself forth in one continued stream of perspicous expression. His mind, indeed, was so active, and he put so much of it into all he said or did, that he kept every other mind on the alert also. This rare and genuine talent was accompanied in him by a simplicity of character almost as rare, and not less truly genuine. He had nothing within or about him that repelled approach, or kept at a distance those who might desire information. On the contrary, he was all frankness, courtesy and ease—ever ready to advise or in- struct his pupils—to listen to their difficulties, clear up their doubts, and encourage and aid their private efforts at improvement. From these various causes, no teacher of his time possessed a higher reputation for talent with his pupils, was more sincerely respected by them, or will live longer in their grateful remembrance. It

JOHN GORDON, M. D. 161 Beside this change in temperature and che- mical composition, the air expired is charged with watery vapour, the source, quantity and composition of which were described. By vari- ous experiments, Dr Gordon ascertained this vapour to be water nearly pure, without any apparent admixture either of Animal or Sa- line matter. He then noticed the change in its electrical state which the air, during its respiration, suffers; and also the facts which suggested the opinion that a part of the air respired suffers, for a time, condensation in the Lungs. A description of the variations in the amount of the changes induced on the air, dependent on sex and age, or on differ- ences in individuals, at different times and in different circumstances, was then deliver- ed : and an enumeration of the changes pro- duced, by respiration, on gases differing in composition from atmospheric air, concluded this second branch of the respiratory func- tion.

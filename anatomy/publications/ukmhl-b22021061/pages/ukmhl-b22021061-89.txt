75 JOHN GORDON, M.D. and Spurzheim to a particular examination of the structure of the Convolutions; so, in its turn, the anatomical hypothesis thence derived is brought to explain the state of the brain in that disease, and the jnanner in which it has been accomplished. The di- sease called Hydrocephalus, or Dropsy of the Brain, consists, as is well known, in an effusion of fluid into the ventricles of that organ. In their natural state, these cavities contain little or no fluid of any kind; and as, in their healthy condition, they cannot be made to contain more than two or three ounces of liquor, it is obvious, that, when the quantity effused increases, as it some- times does, to several pounds, the ventricles must be morbidly enlarged to receive it. Sometimes this enlargement of the ventricles is not accompanied with any enlargement of the external dimensions of the brain, but frequently it is, and then the cavity of the cranium is proportionally increased. In the latter case, the convolutions of the cerebrum g 2

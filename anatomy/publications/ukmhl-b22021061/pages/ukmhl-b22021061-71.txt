57 JOHN GORDON, M. D. two others the cerebrum. The former, or cerebellar set, is said to originate from grey matter in those portions of the medulla ob- longata called corpora restiformia; and, pass- ing respectively to the right and left hemi- spheres of the cerebellum, its fibres are con- tinued through the corpus dent alum, till they terminate in the laminae of the cerebellum, which they thus contribute to form. Of the two sets of cerebral fibres, the first is said to arise from the grey substance of the corpora pyramidalia, and, passing upward through the annular protuberance and crura cerebri, pro- ceeds to form the convolutions chiefly of the anterior and middle lobes : while the second set, commencing in the grey matter of the corpora olivaria, and passing upward, behind the annular protuberance, and through the crura cerebri, are continued through the thalami optici and corpora striata, to form the convolutions of the posterior lobes, and other parts in the direction of the median line. Such are he several sets of divergent fibres

MEMOIR OF 18 that existed among them. Many surgeons have made artificial imitations of luxation on the dried bones of the pelvis and femur, or on the recent bones when deprived of their investing muscular substance. Such experi- ments, however, are fitted only to indicate the obstacles to reduction, from certain promi- nences, and depressions in the bones them- selves; but not to determine, amidst the vio- lent derangement that has been induced, the resistance opposed by muscular action. To discover, therefore, what muscles contributed to retain the head of the bone in its displac- ed situation, and what were most calculated either to oppose, or to favour its return, Dr Gordon produced artificially, on the dead body, the several varieties of luxated femur that occur in practice. Previously, however, to these operations, the soft parts surround- ing the articulation were exposed by dissefc- tion; so that he might be able to mark at once the efficiency of certain parts in resist- ing luxation, the position which the head of

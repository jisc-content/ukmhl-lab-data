MEMOIR OP 112 to be absorbed by appropriate vessels, nam- ed respectively Lacteal and Lymphatic Ab- sorbents : but M. Magendie has lately reviv- ed the more ancient opinion, that the 4 Lac- 4 teal lymph alone is taken up by Absorbent ‘ vessels: that the Vessels, which contain the 4 Colourless lymph, possess no absorbent * power, but originate from the terminations 4 of Arteries; that the Colourless lymph is a 4 part of the Blood returning to the heart by 4 these vessels, instead of the veins: and 4 finally, that all the absorptions hitherto 4 ascribed to these vessels, are perform- 4 ed by Capillary Veins. ’* To these doc- trines Dr Gordon made various objections; and it did not appear to him that M. Magendie’s objections to Hunter’s experi- ments were valid, or that the new experi- ments, by which he attempted to reestablish the old doctrine, were satisfactory. The manner in which the lymph obtains admission into the Lacteal vessels (in which the process is best seen) was then noticed, * Outlines of Physiology, p. 76.

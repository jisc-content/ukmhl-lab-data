In his pub- lic dissections, Dr Spurzheim, it is said, did not attempt to demonstrate this last piece of structure; nor have he and his colleague ever ventured to delineate it in any one of the seven engravings of the cerebellum which ac- company their large work on the Brain. Next, with respect to the divergent fibres of the Cerebrum, it is maintained, that the al- leged origin of the first set from the grey matter of the pyramidal bodies, and their augmentation or * reinforcement â€™ from simi-

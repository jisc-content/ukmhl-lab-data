6 appendix. appendix, no. hi. A Classification of Excretive Secretions—founded on Anatomical Characters, from Dr Gordons Outlines of Physiology, page 67. 1* Those Secretions in which the Excreted Sub- stances are poured out through a Tube or Tubes, formed like a Vein by the union of lesser tubes within the substance of the Organ. Ex. The Lachrymal Gland; the Parotid, Submaxillary, and Sublingual Glands ; the Liver ; the Pancreas ; the Kidneys ; the Testes; 'the Prostate Gland ; Cowper’s Glands ; and the Mamma. 2. Those in which the Excreted Substances escape by Pores of various sizes, the communi- cations ‘of which, within the Organ, are not known. Ex. The Skin ; the Meibomian Glands, and Caruncula Lachrymalis; the Ceruminous Glands; the Labial, Buccal, Lingual, Palatine, Laryngeal, and Pharyngeal Glands ; the Tonsils ; and the Glands of the Alimentary Canal. 3. Those in which the Excreted substances cannot be perceived to escape either through Tubes or Pores. Ex. Serous Membranes;

MEMOIR OF 204- ‘ the place to enlarge on those qualities, which ‘ endeared Dr Gordon to his friends in a de- ‘ gree to which it has seldom been the lot of * mortality to attain. Yet it may be permit- ‘ ted to those, who have so long been asso- ‘ dated with him in the management of this ‘ interesting Institution, to avail themselves 4 of this opportunity of offering a humble, 4 but sincere tribute to the memory of those 4 talents and virtues which had already rais- 4 ed their possessor to so high a rank among 4 his fellow-citizens ; and which, had itpleas- 4 ed Providence to prolong his useful life, 4 would have numbered him among the 4 brightest ornaments of his country. ’ * * This Report, which was put into my hands by my friend Dr Maclagan, only while these sheets were passing through the press, was drawn up, I have since learned, by the late Mr Hay Donaldson, Writer to the Signet, who, but a few weeks ago, was prematurely snatched from his friends and society by the hand of death. He was a gentle- man not more distinguished for his eminent professional ta- lents, than for the active benevolence of his nature; and was greatly endeared to a large circle of friends by the suavity of his manners, the warmth of his affections, and the purity and integrity of his life.

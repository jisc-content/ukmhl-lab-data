JOHN GORDON, M. D. 185 tiny, and judge opinions with the strictest impartiality;—which, in its plan, should be logical and inductive—in its composition, simple and concise;—free alike from trifling details, antiquated hypotheses and idle spe- culations, but seeking always the generaliza- tion of facts and the establishment of legiti- mate theories;—which, in a word, should ex- hibit all that was really known, and pretend not to farther knowledge—Such a work in any of the sciences, and most of all in phy- siology, could not fail to be well received by the public. How far Dr Gordon was quali- fied to execute the task may be gathered from the works he has left behind him, and the acquirements he has been shown to have possessed. That he did not live to make the attempt is matter of the sincerest regret. His published * Outlines, ’ however, of which I have thus briefly sketched the substance, bear ample testimony to the extent of his research, the comprehensiveness of his views, the soli- dity of his judgment, and the correctness of his taste.

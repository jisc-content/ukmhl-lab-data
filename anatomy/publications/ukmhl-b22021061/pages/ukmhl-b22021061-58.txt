HEMOIR OF 44 ly informed of what had been done by o- thers, but of the methods they had severally employed. Parts therefore, and appearances* which seemed new to many, were quite fa- miliar to him • and methods of preparation and dissection, commenced by Vieussens, and carried so far by Reil, though, in general, unknown at that time in this country, and apparently to the anatomists of France, had been studied by him with the greatest care, that subject, and prepared different parts of the brain in the manner described by that author. He did not, how- ever, introduce an account of them into his work, as he was desirous of prosecuting still farther the experiments of Reil, and procuring the papers then only promised,. and which he afterwards obtained. While the part of the vo- lume, which relates to the Brain, was in the press, he ob- tained also the large work on the Brain, by M. M. Gall and Spurzheim. On comparing, however, the plates in that work with the appearances in nature, he found, (as he has expressed in a note, p. 129 of his work on Anatomy), ‘ that these authors had omitted several important parts al- * together; that others were represented indistinctly; and ‘ that there was scarcely a plate in the series, in which * there were not considerable inaccuracies. ’

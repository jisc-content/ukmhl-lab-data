JOHN GORDON, M. D. 61 for matter in the annular protuberance, and crura cerebri, are quite hypothetical; for that very little of such grey matter exists in any of those parts: that the superficial emi- nences, called corpora pyramidalia, cannot be considered equal to the production of so much nervous matter as this description im- plies ; that, instead of augmenting in their passage through the annular protuberance, the fibres of the pyramidal bodies are consi- derably less at the upper part than in the middle of that protuberance; and that the final distribution of these fibres in the grey matter of the convolutions, is a statement wholly incapable of demonstration. Proceeding next to the second set of diver- gent fibres, it is maintained, that their alleg- ed origin from the grey matter of the corpora olivaria is altogether inaccurate; for, like the corpora dentata, those bodies consist of a firmly indented capsule of brown matter, containing a nucleus of pure white substance; that though Drs Gall and Spurzheim affirm, F

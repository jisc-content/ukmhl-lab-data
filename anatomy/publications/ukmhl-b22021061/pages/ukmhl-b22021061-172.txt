MEMOTR OF 158 the Chest and Lungs ; of the causes of their enlargement, and the powers by which it is produced; and of the bulk of air inhaled in an ordinary inspiration, which, by ex- periments on himself, he estimated at 37 cubic inches, and, by the utmost possible in- spiring effort, at 130 cubic inches. Passing then to Expiration, he described the dimi- nution of the cavity of the Chest, the effects of this diminution on the lungs, and the powers by which it is produced. He next stated, that the bulk of air ordinarily ex- pired, equalled exactly that of the air or- dinarily inspired: but that, by an extreme expiration after an extreme inspiration, he could expel from his lungs about 260 cubic inches of air. He reckoned about 20 re- spirations to be made in a minute; and then inquired into the nature of the Sti- mulus which excites the respiratory mus- cles to act, both in Inspiration and Expi- ration. Having thus described the function of Re- spiration in its ordinary and more perfect

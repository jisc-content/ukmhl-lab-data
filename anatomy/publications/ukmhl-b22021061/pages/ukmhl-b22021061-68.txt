54. MEMOIR OF have lived to apply their new physiological principles to investigate the structure of the brain. It is a curious fact, however, that whilst the hypothesis of these anatomists is said to have afforded such powerful aid in the al- leged discovery of the universal fibrousness of the ’white substance of the brain, it should have failed altogether in disclosing another point of structure in this organ, not less visible in itself, nor less easily rendered obvious—namely, that of the fibrous structure of the grey matter of the brain ; which mat- ter both Scemmerring and Reil represent as exhibiting a fibrous appearance when lacerat- ed, either in its recent state, or after indura- tion in alcohol. So far, therefore, the evi- dence of fibrousness in one case is precisely the same as in the other: and if a fibrous appearance be deemed sufficient proof of the fibrous structure of the white matter, it can- not be deemed insufficient to establish that of the grey matter also.

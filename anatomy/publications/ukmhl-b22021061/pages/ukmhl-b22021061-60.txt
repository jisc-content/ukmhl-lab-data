It would be quite out of place, to enter into any detailed view of all the disputed points in this controversy; a few only of the leading questions can here be briefly discuss- ed. Drs Gall and Spurzheim had set out with observing, that the knowledge of the a- natomy of the brain had advanced but slowly,, partly on account of the great delicacy of the organ, and the very defective methods of dissection hitherto employed : but, more es- pecially, from the total want of physiological principles proper to conduct to a knowledge of the nervous system in general, and of the brain in particular. They therefore claimed the merit of introducing new and more suc- cessful methods of dissection, and of being guided always by physiological views in the prosecution of their anatomical investigations. By the combined use of these means, they'

162 MEMOIR OF ges of colour produced in the blood, dur- ing its transmission through the Lungs, Dr Gordon first noticed the change from Mo- dena to Scarlet, which depends, says he, in the first instance, on the disappearance of oxygen from the air inspired, and the simul- taneous formation of an equal bulk of car- bonic acid gas: but how this chemical pro- cess operates, it is not, he adds, easy to con- jecture. To the suppositions that this change of colour in the blood, is to be attributed either to the effect of the Carbonic Acid form- ed: or to the excretion of Carbonaceous matter; or to any combination of Oxygen with the blood; or to the Caloric set free in the lungs, he stated various objections. Nei- ther do we know more how the opposite change of colour from Scarlet to Modena is brought about, during the circulation through the other parts of the system. Connected with the Chemical changes that take place between the air and blood in the lungs, is the subject of Animal Tempera- ture, or the means by which, at all times and

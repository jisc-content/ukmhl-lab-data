memoir OF 84- 4 tinuous with the pyramidal bodies them- 4 selves appear of a white colour: if they 4 are cut across, or horizontally, they exhibit c a grey hue; so that the colour of the dif- * ferent sets of fibres in the annular protube- 4 ranee, depends entirely on the section which 4 is made of them. In a vertical section of 4 this body, the fibres continuous with the 4 corpora pyramidalia are white, and those 4 connected with the peduncles of the cere- 4 bellum grey. In a horizontal section, it is 4 exactly the reverse; the former are grey, 4 and the latter white. â€™ * The foregoing questions, and some others which relate to the minute anatomy of this organ, and respecting which different statements have been given, we willingly leave to the future determination of those who, to the best opportunities, and great- est skill in dissection, bring to the investi- gation minds free from prejudice, and un- shackled by preconceived notions.

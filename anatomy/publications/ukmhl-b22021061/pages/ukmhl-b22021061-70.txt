56 MEMOIR OF cerebrum and cerebellum, on the other : or, reversing the matter, all these fibres might be considered as converging from their ex- tremities towards the medulla oblongata. The fibres, thus described by Reil, are, in his view, one and the same system, and are named Diverging or Convergnig, according to the part from which the description begins, and consequently, according to the direction in which their course may be traced. With Gall and Spurzheim, these fibres form two distinct orders or systems, differing essentially from each other, not in direction only, but in origin, in termination, and in use. We distinguish, say they, in the cerebel- lum and cerebrum, two orders of fibres—the fibres diverging, and the fibres converging. Of these orders, the first, or diverging, is said to originate from the grey or brown mat- ter of the medulla oblongata; and, in refer- ence to the entire brain, may be regarded as consisting of three primitive sets of fibres— one destined to form the cerebellum, and the

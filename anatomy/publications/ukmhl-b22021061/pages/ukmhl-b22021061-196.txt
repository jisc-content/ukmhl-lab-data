MEMOIR OF 182 as a sign of permanent death. The symp- toms and progress of natural decay; the period at which it commences and termi- nates in death ; with instances in which it prematurely begins, or is unusually prolong- ed, were next given. An inquiry into the Causes of decay was then instituted : the ne- cessity of distinguishing decay from the ef- fects of disease was pointed out; and the ques- tion, whether or not the progress of decay be susceptible of modification after its com- mencement, was next discussed. The Course concluded with a view of the rate of Mortality among mankind, as ascer- tained by the investigations of Political E- conomists, and those interested in calcu- lating the contingencies of Human Life:— stating more particularly the rate of general mortality in Great Britain for the whole year, and at different seasons:—the compa- rative mortality of the two sexes;—and its rate at different periods of life, in Great Britain and other countries.

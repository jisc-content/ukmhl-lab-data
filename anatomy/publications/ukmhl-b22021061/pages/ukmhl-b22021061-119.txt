JOHN GORDON, M.D. 105 cumulation of materials that belong to it, the aid which it seeks from almost every other science, and the doubts and difficulties with which it is every where environed, must ad- mit that nothing worthy of the name of Physi- ology can be taught as a mere appendage to an anatomical course. Occasional remarks, indeed, on the healthy functions or morbid actions of parts, or on the operations to which they may be subjected, may some- times be advantageously blended with ana- tomical description ; but to suppose that, in this way, a competent knowledge of physi- ology, pathology, or surgery can be obtain- ed, would be altogether absurd.

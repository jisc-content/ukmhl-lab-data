No one pretends that the several subjects of Natural Philosophy can be pro- fitably taught with the Elements of Mathe- matics: yet the movements of inert matter seek illustration and proof as directly from mathematical principles, as the functions of Living Bodies do from Organic Structure. Although, therefore, these dependent sciences can never be properly dissociated, yet, in the order of instruction, the simple demonstra- tions of the one ought to precede the facts and reasonings of the other. In most of the Universities of Europe, accordingly, in which Medicine is scientifi- cally taught, both Surgery and Physiology have been separated from Anatomy, and treated as distinct sciences.

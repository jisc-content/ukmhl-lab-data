163 JOHN GORDON) M. D. in all seasons, the animal body is enabled to preserve nearly an uniform degree of heat. The opinion of Dr Black that Caloric is ex- tricated in the lungs, during the conversion of oxygen gas into carbonic acid, and that the blood thence derives the heat which it afterwards communicates to the system, was first noticed: next the experiments of Craw- ford on the different capacities of Arterial and Venous blood for heat, and also on those of Oxygen and Carbonic acid gases, were re- ferred to; and the objections lately brought against them detailed. It was then stated, that the experiments of the same philoso- pher, and those of MM. Lavoisier and Laplace, made to ascertain the comparative quantities of caloric, extricated in the forma- tion of equal quantities of Carbonic acid, by the consumption of oxygen in respiration and combustion, placed this theory of a- nimal heat on grounds quite independent of Crawfordâ€™s doctrine of capacities; and proved that respiration might be a source of animal temperature, by evidence which

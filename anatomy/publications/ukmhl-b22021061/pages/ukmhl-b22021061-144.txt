He then considered at large other phenome- na attending Muscular action, as the bulk and hardness of muscle, and the force and extent of its action. The proximate cause of action in a muscle, he held to consist in a temporary increased attraction between the particles of the fibre: and the remote causes were pro- nounced to be Stimuli of various, kinds.

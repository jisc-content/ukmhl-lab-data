APPENDIX. 5 long essay on the minute structure of the Cere- brum or Brain-Proper. This essay commences with some observations on the method of prepar- ing and dissecting the parts, which he had fol- lowed with success; and he here pronounces the method of investigation, adopted by Gall, to be inadequate. Then follows a complete descrip- tion of the apparent fibres of the Cerebrum, which does not at all correspond with that given by Gall. In the same year, appeared an additional paper on the Structure of the Medulla Oblongata, and the parts situated behind the Pons Varolii. Lastly, in 1812 appeared three additional papers—theJirst on the Anterior Commissure of the Brain-proper—the second on the Septum Lu- cidum and its Ventricle, on the Fornix, and on the Lateral Ventricles—and the third contained some additional observations on the Structure of parti- cular parts both of the Cerebrum and Cerebel- lum.

So correctly did this ar- tificial imitation on the dead body correspond with the dislocations that occur in the living subject, that it was found exceedingly diffi- cult, if not altogether impossible, to produce artificially, any other species of dislocation than those which actually present themselves in practice; and the external character of the real accident in the living body, and of its imitation on the dead one, always corres- ponded closely with each other. * Informa- tion thus sought, coupled with accurate ob- servation of the external appearances of the parts, could not fail to improve the means of discriminating the varieties of dislocation to which this joint is exposed; to impart correct notions of the actual position of the displac- * It appears, that Professor Bonn of Amsterdam, (re- ferred to by Professor Turner, in his * Probationary Es- ‘ say ’ on the dislocations of the Shoulder-joint, Edin- burgh, 1812), had previously employed a similar mode of inquiry, in relation to that joint.

JOHN GORDON, M.D. 99 to me, either that their good opinion of themselves, or their ill opinion of others, entitled them to extraordinary indulgence. And therefore, when a critic, in the exami- nation of their doctrines, saw sufficient cause to question their knowledge and sincerity, he was surely at full liberty to retaliate, by throwing back on themselves the imputations they would fix upon others. The last anatomical work which Dr Gor- don communicated to the public, was a Fas- ciculus of Plates in octavo, exhibiting a series of representations of those parts of the Human Skeleton, with which it is of most importance for the physiologist and the medical practitioner to be accurately acquaint- ed. On the publication of the first volume of his System of Anatomy, he had express- ed his regret in not having been then able to accompany it with a series of engravings, on account chiefly of the great delay and ex- pense necessarily attendant on such a plan. i 2

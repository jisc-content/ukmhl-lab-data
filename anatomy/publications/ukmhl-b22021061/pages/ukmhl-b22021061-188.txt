The form and structure of this last organ, its capacity, the sensations of which it is susceptible, its secretions, and the chemical changes which they produce on the food, constituting the function of Digestion, were severally discussed; to which succeed- ed an account of the propulsion of the food into the small intestines; of the powers by which that operation is accomplished; of the stimulus exciting the action of these powers, and the circumstances which modify their actions. Arrived thus in a digested state in the In- testine, the food there undergoes farther chemical changes, which lead to the forma- tion of the Chyle. The agents employed in effecting these changes are, first, the Bile, the chemical composition and properties of which were detailed, together with an ac- count of its secretion by the Liver, and an inquiry whether it be secreted by the Vena

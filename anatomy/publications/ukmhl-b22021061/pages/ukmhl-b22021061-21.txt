7 JOHN GORDON, M. D. jects, which have ever been leading character- istics of the Edinburgh school. This Society arose out of a private meeting of medical students, who, so far back as the autumn of the year 1734, assembled, at first once a fort- night, to read an Essay, written by one of its members, on some subject connected with their studies. Of these students Dr A. Rus- sel, the natural historian of Aleppo,' and Dr George Cleghorn, author of a well known work on the Diseases of Minorca, were a- mong the most distinguished. The follow- ing year, viz. 1735, Dr John Fothergill and Dr Cullen became members of it; and thus this private meeting laid the foundation of the Medical Society, which became more for- mally incorporated the year after, and has flourished ever since to the great advance- ment of medical science in this University. * In this Society, all subjects connected with medical science are submitted to the freest discussion, without any other reserve than â€¢ History of the Medical Society. Edinburgh, 1820.

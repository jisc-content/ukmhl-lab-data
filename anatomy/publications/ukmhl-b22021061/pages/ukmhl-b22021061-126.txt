MEMOIR OF 112 from being all-sufficient; and great as have been the aids which it has rendered, it has also, on many occasions, by imperfect ob- servation and forced analogies, contributed to the spread of error. To the knowledge of vision, of muscular motion, and some o- ther functions, the science of Natural Philo- sophy has afforded important aid : but when it attempted to explain all the diversified movements of the living system on mechani- cal principles, and reduce them to actual calculation, it completely failed. In earlier and more recent times, Chemistry also has lent the greatest assistance to Physiology; and many functions of the system can receive il- lustration only by the aid of that science. This necessary aid which it renders, has however led, in many instances, to its hasty and extravagant application; and, as might be expected, the chemical processes, least un- derstood in themselves, have been those em- ployed with the greatest confidence in the ex- planation of the animal functions.

Each con- volution, it is added, may be easily separat- ed into two layers; and if this separation ex- tend through the whole convolutions, all their duplicatures will be transformed, it is said, into a kind of membranous expansion, white, smooth, and fibrous beneath, and co- vered exteriorly with grey substance* Such an expansion is declared to happen in advanc- ed stages of hydrocephalus; and it was such a case, it seems, which first led Drs Gall and Spurzheim to examine the structure of the brain in general, and of the convolutions in particular. This separation of them into two layers, it is alleged, may also be accomplish**

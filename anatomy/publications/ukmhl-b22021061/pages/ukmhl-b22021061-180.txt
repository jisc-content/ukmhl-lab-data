166 MEMOIR OF organs, was made to terminate the descrip- tion of the several parts of the respiratory function. The air, after performing its important office within the lungs, is expelled from those organs through the Trachea or Wind- pipe, the general structure and functions of which, Dr Gordon briefly described. He next considered the Windpipe as a regulator of the quantity of air inspired and expired. This it accomplishes by changes in the po- sition of the parts forming the Larynx, by which means enlargement or diminution of the Glottis is produced. The occasions on which these changes take place were then noticed ; and the muscles which produce them, toge- ther with the stimuli that excite them to act, were described. It was added, that various causes, by exciting spasmodic ac- tions in the muscles, vary the diameter of the Glottis; and that certain other causes diminish its diameter, independent of the action of these muscles.

JOHN GORDON, M, D. 223 fixed, it was held accordingly, and the * Re- solutions ’ adopted were transmitted to Dr Gordon by the gentleman* who presided on the occasion. These Resolutions expressed in substance the high respect of the class for Dr Gordon’s talents, and the desire of its members to have testified their approbation of his labours, by presenting him with a piece of plate; which design they relinquished only in deference to his private sentiments. On the following day, Dr Gordon, in reference to these Reso- lutions, addressed his class from a written paper, in the following terms :— ‘ Gentlemen, £ My feelings will not permit me to ‘ enter on the proper business of this meet- ‘ ing, until I have returned you my very ‘ sincerest thanks for the communication ‘ which I last night received from you, * through a highly respectable member of ‘ your body. * Mr P. Sandberg.

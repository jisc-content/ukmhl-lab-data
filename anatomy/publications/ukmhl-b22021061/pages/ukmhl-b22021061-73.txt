JOHN GORDON, M. D. 59 those of its opposite, produce the different parts or commissures by which the two he- mispheres are joined. As the fibres of this system, from their alleged origin to their ter- mination, are said continually to converge, they have been denominated the converging system ; and from their supposed termination in the parts which connect the two hemi- spheres of the brain, they derive the appella- tion of the â€˜ Apparatus of Junction or Re- union. * Of these two alleged fibrous systems, Dr Gordon declares the greater part to rest only on hypothetical assumptions, or on descrip- tions which have no prototype in nature; that the small portion of truth they contain has been long known to anatomists; and that the later investigations of Reil into the fi- brous structure of the brain, are not only more minute and elaborate, but their results at variance, in every prrticular, with these conjectural statements. He affirms general- ly, that the origin of any of the fibres of the

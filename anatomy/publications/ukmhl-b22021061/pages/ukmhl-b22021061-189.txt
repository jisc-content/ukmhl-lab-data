JOHN G015D0N, M.D. 175 Portarum or Hepatic artery. Its passage from the liver either into the Intestine, or Gall-bladder, and the causes which modify its quantity or quality, or more or less com- pletely obstruct its flow, were then described; and some remarks made on the derangements of the biliary system thence arising. Besides the Liver, the Spleen has been supposed to assist in this part of the alimen- tary function. Its structure was therefore de- scribed, and a brief notice taken of the hypotheses advanced in relation to it;â€”but of its real function, nothing satisfactory was declared to be known. Concerning the Pan- creas, we have better information; and the chemical history and properties of its se- creted fluid, the mode of its formation, and the quantity and manner in which it flows into the intestine, were described. With these fluids are mixed those furnished by the intestine itself; and an inquiry was then insti- tuted into the manner in which all these a- gents operate on the food, and the circum- stances which modify their action.

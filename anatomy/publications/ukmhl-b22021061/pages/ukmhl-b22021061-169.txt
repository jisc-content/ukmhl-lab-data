JOHN GORDON, M.D. 155 tions of it, given in his engravings of the Skeleton, already noticed. Nor had he been less attentive to its physiology, his lec- tures on this function exhibiting the results of many ingenious and original experiments. He. first enumerated the several qualities of sensations of sound, and inquired next into the causes of those-sensations;—then showed that sonorous vibrations were communicated to the internal ear, either by the ordinary external passage, or by the solid parts of the head;—and afterwards followed the progress of these vibrations across the tympanum to the Labyrinth, and their propagation from thence to the Auditory Nerve. He next stated experiments, made by himself and o- thers, to prove the communication of simi- lar vibrations to the labyrinth by the solid parts of the head, and showed their appli- cation in deciding on the nature of deaf- ness, and in teaching deaf mutes to speak. In discussing the causes of the different qua- lities perceptible in sensations of sound, Dr

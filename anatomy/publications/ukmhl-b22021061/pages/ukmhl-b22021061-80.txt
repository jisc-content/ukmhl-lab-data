MEMOIR OF 66 But hypothetical and erroneous as the de- scription of the Divergent system of fibres has been shown to be, it is affirmed by Dr Gordon, that the account given of what has been denominated the Convergent system, far exceeds it in error, and is, in truth, altogether imaginary and false. He maintains that no fi- bres, answering to their alleged system, can be shown to come out from the grey substance of the convolutions of any pan of the brain, as these anatomists assert; that such a structure is purely hypothetical, and wholly at variance with the real structure of these parts, as un- folded by the investigations of Reil; that these anatomists themselves admit, that they can follow these two systems as ‘ distinct and vi- 1 sible fibres,’ only in the posterior convolu- tions of the middle lobes of the cerebrum, where, however, it is said to be just as im- possible to demonstrate them, as in any of country, may perhaps be acceptable to those who take an interest in such pursuits. I shall therefore append it to this Memoir. * * See Appendix, No. 2.

55 JOHN GORDON, M. D. Having thus established that the fibrous structure of the brain, or rather the appear- ance which gives rise to that opinion, was known to anatomists long before the days of Gall and Spurzheim, Dr Gordon proceeds next to examine some peculiar notions of these anatomists respecting the alleged origin, termination, and uses of these fibres in com- posing the great mass of the brain. He re- marks, that Malpighi long ago observed, that, if we proceed to describe the fibrous struc- ture of the brain by commencing at the base, in that part called medulla oblongata, the whole of the fibres might there be said to originate and ramify in all directions, till they terminate at the vertex in the cortical or grey matter. A similar mode of descrip- tion was afterwards employed by Reil, who states, that, if we set out from the medulla oblongata, all the fibres might be regarded as radiating or diverging from this point to the extremities of the nerves, on the one hand, and to the extremities of the fibres in the

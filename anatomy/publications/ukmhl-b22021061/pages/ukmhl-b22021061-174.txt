MEMOIR OF 160 Dr Gordon stated its temperature to be in- creased, and that it loses a part of its Oxygen gas, and gains an exactly equal bulk of Car- bonic acid gas, while its Azotic portion is ex- pelled unaltered. With respect to the man- ner in which this change in the chemical composition of the respired air is brought about, he considered the view, which, seve- ral years ago, the writer of this Memoir ventured to propose, # as the most probable: viz. (that Carbonaceous matter is excreted ‘ into the air cells of the Lungs, by the ‘ blood-vessels of those organs;—that, in ‘ these cells, this matter combines directly ‘ with part of the oxygen of the air respired, ‘ and forms carbonic acid gas;—that all the ‘ oxygen which the inspired air loses is em- ‘ ployed in the formation of this acid;—and ‘ that all the oxygen contained in this acid, ‘ has been derived from the inspired air.’ f * Inquiries into the Changes induced on Atmospheric Air by the Germinations of Seeds, the Vegetation of Plants, and the Respiration of Animals.

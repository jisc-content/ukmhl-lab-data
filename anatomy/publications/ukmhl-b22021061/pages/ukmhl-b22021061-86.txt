In 1809 and 1812, he published farther investigations into the structure of this part of the brain, and described a stra- tum of white fibres, lying between the bot- toms of the convolutions and the central parts of the brain, and connecting the con- volutions to each other. 4 Nothing, ’ says Dr Gordon, 4 can be more correct than the 4 descriptions given by Reil of the laminat- 4 ed structure and fibrous appearance of the 4 convolutions. With regard to the interme- 4 diate substance, the dissections which I have 4 hitherto made, do not enable me to speak 4 with confidence; though I have no doubt, 4 from Reil’s general accuracy, both as to 4 its existence, and the correctness of the re- 4 presentations he has given of it. ’ * From what has just been stated, it appears, that the investigations of Reil, regarding the

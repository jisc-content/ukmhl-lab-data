48 MEMOIR OF Ruteness by Reil, in 1795, and in his subse- quent researches. Farther, instead of cutting the parts with the scalpel, Drs Gall and Spurzheim sepa- rate the medullary matter of the brain by scraping, or tearing it with the fingers, or handle of the scalpel, the better, it is said, to display its fibrous structure. This operation was also assumed as new ; but Dr Gordon has shown it to have been practised more than a century ago by Vieussens, to have been adopted by Morgagni, and subsequent- ly employed both by Mayer and Reil. Hence, therefore, it is quite evident that, neither in the mode of demonstration, nor in the mani- pulations made use of, can these anatomists lay claim to priority of invention: and even the smaller merit of reviving these methods belongs not to them, but to their laborious, modest, and candid countryman Reil. The first results on the anatomy of the brain, in which the methods and manipulations above mentioned were extensively employed by

MEMOIR OF 24 disease. Nevertheless, a deep sense of the importance of morbid anatomy, to the im- pi’ovement not only of practical medicine, but of physiology, rendered Dr Gordon al- ways eager to embrace opportunities of mor- bid dissection. How much to the satisfac- tion of his Colleagues in the Infirmary, he performed this duty, may be learned from the honourable tribute rendered to his me- mory by Dr Duncan junior, in his late valu- able 4 Reports of the practice in the Clini- 4 cal Wards of the Royal Infirmary of E- * dinburgh.’—‘ The dissections contained in 4 the Appendix to these Reports, ’ says Dr Duncan, 4 I consider very valuable. To me 4 they are particularly interesting, as being 4 the last fruits of my professional intercourse 4 with the late Dr John Gordon, whose zeal 4 and science as a pathological anatomist, 4 qualified him so eminently for the situa- 4 tion he filled in the Hospital, and whose 4 private virtues made him most beloved by 4 those who knew him best. * * * Reports, &c. p. 51.

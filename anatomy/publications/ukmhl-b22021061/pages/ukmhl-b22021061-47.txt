33 JOHN GORDON, M.D. organs. Nothing can exceed the general perspicuity and conciseness of the descrip- tive language employed by Dr Gordon in this work. He uniformly addresses himself to the eye, avoids all discussion of questions of doubt and opinion, and enters into mi- nute details with a clearness and precision which those only who write from actual ob- servation can command. Some parts, as those of the brain and nervous system, are very elaborately treated. The author had not only consulted all the best writers, but submitted, to the test of actual examination, the accuracy of every description connected with the anatomy of that organ, His de- scriptions of it will, therefore, be found much more minute than those of any preceding British writer. Some, perhaps, may regard them as too refined and elaborate, especial- ly for an elementary work ; and we think the convenience of the reader would have been consulted, had the subject been broken into smaller sections, instead of forming, as it now does, one continuous demonstration.

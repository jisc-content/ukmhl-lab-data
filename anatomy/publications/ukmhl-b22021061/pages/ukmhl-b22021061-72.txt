58 MEMOIR OF which are said to form the greater part of the brain; and, in conformity with this no- tion, they are named the 4 Apparatus of Formation. â€™ The converging system of these anatomists, is, in almost all respects, opposed to that which has been just described. Like the for- mer, however, its fibres are said to originate from grey matter : but the place of their ori- gin, their course, termination, and use, are altogether different. Instead of springing from a circumscribed part of the medulla ob- longata, they arise, it is said, from the grey matter distributed over the entire surface of the brain ; that is, they originate in that por- tion of those very convolutions in which the divergent fibres were declared to terminate. Commencing thus, by an expanded origin over both hemispheres, their filaments are said to unite as they proceed inward, and, crossing the opposite fibres in their course, they at length reach the median plane, where the fibres of each hemisphere, uniting with

103 JOHN GORDON, M. D. tinction in that country, himself the author of a splendid work on Surgical Anatomy. That a similar opinion of its merits was entertained at home, I am happy to witness, from a letter I find addressed to the author by a Physician, once enjoying the highest re- putation as a Teacher of Anatomy, and now, by the united suffrage of his brethren and the public, elevated to the head of that pro- fession which he dignifies and adorns. 4 I * return you my best thanks, ’ says Dr Bail- lie, 4 for your Engravings of the Human 4 Skeleton, which you have been so good as 4 to send me. The Engravings are extreme- 4 ly well executed, the various sections well 4 imagined, and the short descriptions pos- 4 sess all that precision for which you are dis- 4 tinguished. The work, when it is finished, 4 will be very useful to the public, and credit- 4 able to yourself. ’

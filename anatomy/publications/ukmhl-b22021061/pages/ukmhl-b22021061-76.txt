62 MEMOIR OF that a strong fasciculus of fibres comes out of these bodies, yet they have nowhere shown at what part these fibres emerge, either in their plates or public demonstrations; that the alleged union of these fasciculi with o- thers of the medulla oblongata, and their as- cent behind the posterior boundary of the annular protuberance, is quite imaginary, and altogether inconsistent with the statement of their passing between the transverse fibres of that body; and that the subsequent progress of these fibres through the thalami optici and corpora striata, receiving reinforcements in their course, and finally terminating in the convolutions of the posterior lobe, is purely hypothetical, and wholly indemonstrable. Lastly, with reference to the history of this particular fibrous structure, it is observed, that the passage of the fibres of the pyrami- dal bodies through the annular protuber- ance into the peduncles or crura cerebri, w'as known to, and described by Vieussens, Morgagni, Petit, Vicq dâ€™Azyr and Haller;

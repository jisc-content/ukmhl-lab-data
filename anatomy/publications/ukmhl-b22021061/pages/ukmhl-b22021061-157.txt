Respecting the changes which the lymph undergoes in its course, and the uses of the Absorbent Glands, little or nothing has been ascertained. This branch of the subject was terminated by a view of the functions of the Absorbent and Circulating systems reciprocally considered. It was shown that the waste of blood, by the various excretions, was continually repaired by the addition of new matter: and that, ac- cording to the proportion between the actions of deposition and absorption, there is growth or wasting, or permanency of bulk, in parts. After exhibiting these views of the Nervous Circulating and Absorbent Systems, which more or less contribute to the construction of the several Textures and Organs, Dr Gordon entered on the functions of some particular Textures, also of very general

MEMOIR OF 6 In the year 1S03, Dr Gordon was elected a member of the Medical Society—an Insti- tution highly favourable to the development of talent, and contributing, in no ordinary degree, to that inquiring disposition, and in- dependent mode of thinking on medical sub- It was only towards the latter years of his life, that he had leisure to devote much time to original investigation ; and then, unhappily, disease had made such inroads on a frame naturally delicate, that nothing less than a mind of unusual activity and vigour could have borne him through the labours which he actually accomplished. His beautiful experiments on the communication of heat through liquids ; and his new views on the composition of mineral waters, derived from an examination of the modes in which the ordinary results of analysis may be modified in the succes- sive stages of the process, are well known ■ to chemists, and afford ample evidence of the acuteness with which he contemplated the phenomena of the science, and the skill and ability which he exerted in removing its imperfections : While his discussions on the prevailing theories of Geo- logy ; on the nature and relations of Oxymuriatic Acid; on the theory of Acidity ; and, more especially, the philoso- phical views of chemical doctrine exhibited in his excellent 1 System of Chemistry, ’ do equal credit to the depth and extent of his knowledge, and to his talent for arrangement and generalization in the most difficult departments of the science.

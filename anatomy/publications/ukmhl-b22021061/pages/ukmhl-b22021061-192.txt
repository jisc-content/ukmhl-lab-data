This state, how- ever, it retains only for a limited period; for, in the same gradual manner, the solids which have been thus formed, are brought to a fluid condition, and, being reassumed into the circulation, are expelled, in turn, from the system. The organs which contribute most large- ly to carry off this reabsorbed matter are the Kidneys, the functions of which Dr Gordon proceeded next to consider.

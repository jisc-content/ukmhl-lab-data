In reply to the French anatomists, they were, however, obliged to admit, that many others had previously recognised the white substance to be in general fibrous. Driven thus from the ground of priority, they next maintained there was not one who had asserted that it is fibrous under all its forms, and in all its re- gions ; and that even those who, with Soem- merring and Cuvier, recognise a fibrous struc- ture in many parts of the brain, have not dared to say that it is everywhere fibrous. * e c La premiere et la plus importante des decouvertes, c meme sous un rapport purement mecanique, celle sans ‘ laquelle toutes les autres seroient imparfaites, e’est celle ‘ de la structure constamnlent fibreuse de la substance * blanche du cerveau partout ou elle se trouve. Depuis * Vieussens et Leuwenhoek, plusieurs anatomistes ont, il * est vrai, bien reconnu que cette substance est on general * fibreuse : cependant nous n’en trouvons pas un seul qui * soit convaincu qu’elle est fibreuse sous toutes ses formes

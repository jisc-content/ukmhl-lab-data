Along with the change of Colour which the blood exhibits in the lungs, it seems to undergo, likewise, a change of Composition of the utmost importance to the animal e- conomy, which, for the sake of brevity, and until its nature be better known, may be called its{ Essential change.â€™ Thermo^cause of this change, says Dr Gordon, is the same as that which alters the colour of the blood: the more immediate cause is quite unknown. After this description of the natural and healthy actions that go on in the lungs, Dr Gordon proceeded to state the variations that occur in different individuals, and un- der different circumstances, with regard to the degree of change effected in the colour, temperature, and other properties of the blood. He detailed next the effects produc- ed on the blood by the respiration of various gases differing, in chemical composition,

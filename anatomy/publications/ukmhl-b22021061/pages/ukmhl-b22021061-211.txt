JOHN GORDON, M. D. 197 Members of the Medical Society, still far- ther to perpetuate their respect, set on foot a subscription, (confined to those of their own body) to procure a Bust of their la- mented Associate to be placed in their Hall; which that excellent artist Mr Jo- seph is engaged to furnish. * The senior members of the Profession were not less alive to the merits of Dr Gor- don, and to the services which he had ren- dered to science. At a meeting of the Pcoyal College of Surgeons, ‘ Resolutions’ were passed, expressing the ‘ strong sense enter- ‘ tained by its members of the zealous and * successful exertions of their fellow mem- * Very highly to his own credit, and greatly to the sa- tisfaction of Dr Gordon’s friends, Mr Joseph has executed the Model for the Bust: And when it is considered that he had never seen Dr Gordon, nor had any subject to work from, but the excellent Miniature, of which the Engraving prefixed to this volume presents an accurate Copy, one cannot but admire the talent which has enabled him thus happily to transfer to Marble the minute proportions and delicate touches of the Pencil.

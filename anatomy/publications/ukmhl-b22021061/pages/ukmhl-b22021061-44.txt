Magendie, believed all the solids capable of being reduced, in the last analysis, to a simple fibre ; an idea admitted by Haller, who regarded this fibre, however, as invisible, and cognizable by the mind alone. By modifications of this simple fibre, secondary fibres, which received particular denominations, were held to be formed. M. Pinel is said first to have conceived the idea of dis- tinguishing the organic solids, not by fibres, but by tissues or systems. This idea was adopted by Bichat, who applied it to all the solid parts of the body. It has subsequently received correction and improvement from Dupuytren and Bicherand, who enumerate eleven primary tissues or sys- tems, which, by their association with one another, and with the fluids, compose the several organs or instruments of life.â€” Precis, Elem, de Fkysiologie, t. 1 >pp> 8,9, 10.

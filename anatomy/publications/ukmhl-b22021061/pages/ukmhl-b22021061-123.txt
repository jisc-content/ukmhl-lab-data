Among the inherent difficulties may be mentioned our total ignorance of the mi- nute anatomy of every texture and organ, when we approach the mechanism of its ulti- mate structure. Of the nature of the living properties of these textures and organs, and of the modes in which they exercise their pecu- liar functions, we are equally ignorant.

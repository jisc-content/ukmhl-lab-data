It also occurs, though rarely, m the lung, where engorgement and haemorrhage usually follow. f b) Engorgement and haemorrhage are the usual consequences of blocking of an artery in the sx»leen, kidneys, retina, or lungs, and sometimes in the brain. Engorgement is caused by regur- gitation of blood from the veins. When the blood current from the heart is stopped, and the vis a tergo of the blood current annihilated, the pressure from the capillaries into the veins becomes less than the backward pressure from the veins into the capillaries, till ultimately (provided there are no valves in the °fn (“Gener^ pathoiog*j explameddby impossible to conceive that hemorrhage L caused merely by excessive tension, since the pressure caused by re^gitation could hardly be greater than the normal arterial pressure” Cohnheim explains it to be a consequence of the alterations in the structure, or, m fact, necrosis of Lhe walk ■ ^capillaries caused ITZ tis°suesCanTh s was established by’experiments on tie tongue orithe 2*1 fook pl^from the capillaries.

THE PLACENTA. 79S Inflammation of the placenta begins from the uterine surface, or in the substance of the organ, and presents the various stages seen in other parts, producing local or general hepatization, effusion, irregular adhesions, and secondary degenerations. Inflammation may attack the whole, ora portion of the placenta. The effusion and compression of the tissues will vaiy according to the extent of the inflammation, causing more or less obliteration of Fig. 185. Sectional view of atrophied placenta. The atrophy and fatty degeneration of the maternal and foetal portions were caused by a fibrinous layer on the uterine surface. a, Fibrinous deposit, b, Maternal portion of placenta, c, Foetal portion. the blood-vessels. In an extreme case we find a capsule of dense lymph encasing the maternal surface, the whole is considerably reduced below the normal size, and the soft, spongy texture is con- verted into a compact splenified mass. This layer must he fur- nished by inflammation of the membrana decidua. If confined to individual lobules, the alteration will be limited in a corresponding degree. Those instances of adherent placenta which are the source of so much anxiety to the accoucheur, are probably referable to a prior inflammatory attack, glueing the after-birth to the uterus. Professor Simpson admits the occurrence of total absorption of a placenta as one of the consequences which may result from the agglutination of the after-birth to the uterus. A third stage oi iutlammation is occasionally met with in the shape of abscesses or of purulent infiltration; it is also stated to give rise to the effusion of pus between the two surfaces of the uterus and placenta. _ Roki- tansky describes suppuration occurring herein the form of circum- scribed abscesses, or of diffused infiltration and fusion. Fatty degeneration of the placenta, to which Professor Ivilian and Dr. Earnes have recently drawn attention, is probably to be explained

INFLAMMATION' OF THE STOMACH. 502 the mucous membrane may be indurated or softened; the latter is more frequent than the former. Induration may exist with all the.; different shades of colour just mentioned. With respect to its substance the mucous membrane may be thickened or attenuated, or may remain unaltered. A state of thickening may coexist with induration or with softening; the former combination is peculiars Fir,. 128.

Attenuation of the gastric mucous membrane is nips' 1 often met with towards the great cul-de-sac, in the same situatioi where softening is most frequent. Andral says, “ Sometimes; however, I have found the mucous membrane towards the pyloru so attenuated that it resembled a sort of transparent, extreme^ fine web. On attempting to raise it, it was changed into a reddisi white pulp, as happens in certain degrees of softening." HI admits, what we shall presently remark, that this attenuation mai occur as a pure atrophy totally independent of inflammation. i Minute Changes in the Stomach.—We have examined carefnll;! with the microscope more than a hundred stomachs taxen nvj differently, and have published in the “ Assoc. Journal lor Or* 7th and Jan. 27th, 1854, the details of the following, vanetie of change:—(1) One of the commonest, especially in its mmo degrees, consists in the infiltration of a low fibroid tissue 1°“®] with nuclei or small cells among the tubes, which tliemse vcj undergo atrophy, so that at last the mucous membrane total!, loses its tubular aspect, and becomes a mere fibroid stra mj more or less densely set with nuclei throughout. In this st. j the basement membrane may still persist, and the thickness

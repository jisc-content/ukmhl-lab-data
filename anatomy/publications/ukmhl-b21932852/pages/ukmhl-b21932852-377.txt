361 DISEASES OF THE VALVES OF THE HEART. disease in producing hypertrophy is a point of great importance, and its connection with pericardial and endocardial inflammation has been especially dwelt upon by Bouillaud. Its influence in affecting the circulation in the brain is undeniable, hut it is pro- bable that the frequency with which it induces haemorrhage, either in the lungs or in the brain, has been over-rated. In most, if not all, of the, cases on record of cerebral apoplexy connected with cardiac hypertrophy, the result was more justly attributable to the coincident arterial disease than to the increased impulse of an en- larged heart. Pulmonary apoplexy appears rather to be connected with the obstructions to the circulation presented by mitral disease, and with the blocking up of branches of the pulmonary artery, than with an hypertrophic condition of the heart. With regard to the liver, we find that in fatty degeneration of the heart it com- monly presents a similar concomitant affection, not to speak of tho i congestion to which it is almost invariably subject when the return 1 of the blood to the heart is in any way impeded. Congestions of the venous system of the entire body are frequent in cardiac i disease, and manifest themselves by lividity of the cutaneous : surface, and of the mucous membranes; and the secondary effects ' of stasis are shown in these tissues by oedema and haemorrhage, while in the serous cavities they are evidenced by an effusion of serum—one form of passive dropsy. Of the latter we find the peritoneum chiefly prone to suffer, a circumstance which we may • fairly attribute to the absence of any compression, such as we find i normally exerted upon all the other serous sacs.

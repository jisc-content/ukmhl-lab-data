Having become stationary, the embryo passes through a course off and tbe caudal vesicle enlarges mto a bladder composed of a fibrous external membrane, often laminated (ectocyst,, and an inner parenchymatous, or blastc-matous layer (endocyat), while there is an adven- titious cystic covering, external to all, formed by the condensed fibrous tissue oi the organ in which it is lodged. In this state it constitutes what is termed a hydatid CJEchinococcus Cysts.-V?hen cut into the cyst is found to be filled with a transparent watery fluid, having a specific gravity oi 1-008 to 1-013, neutral or slightly alkaline, containing very little, if any albumen (and thus strikingly different from serous efiu- sions), some extractive or fatty matter, and some salts, especially chloride of sodium. Such a cyst may remain single, but may also be multiplied by exogenous or endo- genous development; and occasionally a multilocular form is met with in which there is no large cystic cavity, but a ma» made up of a multitude of small cyst, not larger than a pea. The endogenous mode of development is the most common in man, and is also seen m the ox.

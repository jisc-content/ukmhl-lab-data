Hypertrophy has been described as occurring in three forms, to ■ winch Bertin was the tirst to draw attention, and his classification has been adopted by subsequent writers. In the first, which is termed simple hypertrophy, the walls of the heart are thickened, * while the cavities retain their normal dimensions; the second' excentnc or aneurismal hypertrophy, presents an augmentation,’ Doth ot the lumen of the cavities and of the substance of their panetes; and in the third, which has received the name of con- centric hypertrophy, the former is reduced, while the latter is alone increased. The last variety probably has no existence as a morbid condition, but is, according to the showing of Cruveilhier and Dr ,bu'*d, a post-mortem effect, an evidence, simply, of the powerful tonic contraction of a robust heart. The former writer observed a occulTe(i in almost all persons decapitated by the guillotine and the latter has pointed out that in all concentrically hyper- trophied hearts the ventricle may bo easily dilated by means of the an<l always dilates of itself, when the rigor mortis noes ,1 ihe sjmplo and excentnc forms, then, are the two which done constitute actual cardiac disease. “ Mf-moires do la Socidtd d’Ob3ervation,'’ tom. i. p. 262.

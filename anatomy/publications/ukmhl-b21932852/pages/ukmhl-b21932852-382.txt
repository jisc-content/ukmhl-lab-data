3G6 m—MALFORMATIONS DEPENDING UPON PREMATURE CLOSURE, OR PERMANENT PATENCY OF THE FCETAL OPENINGS. The changes which are rendered necessary in the totus after birth by the cessation of the placental and the estabbshment of a pulmonary circulation, affect chiefly two parts, namely, the ductus arteriosus^and the foramen ovale; and these openings may be either prematurely closed or remain unduly patent. Premature closure of the ductus arteriosus is of course an anomaly belonging to festal life, but the results first become appa- rent after birth. The consequence of it is that the pulmonar > Xy?yes^passage during total life only to the very smaU amount of blood which circulates through the lungs, and is in consequence so imperfectly developed as to be incapable of adequately expanding after birth and of conveying the larger quantity of blood which should then be transmitted. Thei small size of ' tin; vessel thus becomes a source of permanentob trnc- tion, which entails other defects in the development of the °Vf?ema^re2mre of the foramen ovale leads to excessive develop- ment of the right side of the heart and corresponding imperfechon r tim Ipfl- side A case of this description is recorded by alt. r e Sh to the firsl volume of the “Pathological Transactions,’ wW this opening was entirely wanting in a child which survived itSiSmwntY Arteriosus.

241 TUBERCULAR MEXINGITIS. The deposit of tubercle on tho pia mater of the brain occurs in the shape of small miliary granules, resembling the Pacchionian bodies in appearance, hut differing from them both in their site and their microscopic relations. They are not seen on the free Pio. 68. *™ary 1tubvrfil0.S in, th® Syl™n fissure of tbe brain of a child, aged nineteen P”nt.bs’ wbci died ten days from the first appearance of head symptoms The white blood-ve^S’H repre8ent the tubercles, which were surrounded by highly-congested SUI'[ai-'° of tbe arachnoid; and, in fact, seem in no way connected with this membrane ; a point which establishes a marked difference between it and the serous membranes of the thorax and the abdo- men. They are found most frequently deeply within the Sylvian p,*Jre’ U1 the convolutions of the brain, and at the base; they are 01 the size of pins’ heads, and appear in the form of grey granu- lations, imbedded among a vascular network ; they are very rarely lound upon the cerebellum. A careful examination is necessary to prevent their being overlooked; but if not seen on the pia mater useil they may often bo found on the minute vessels proceeding mom the pia mater into the brain or on the delicate processes of Pia mater which dip down between the convolutions. Their presence is always associated with more or less inflammation as shown by the production of yellow false membranes in the situations pointed out above as the usual seats of meningitis of tbebase. Tho amount of inflammation is by no means nro rntli101? !° th? numbo11' of tubercular granulations, but seems rather to depend upon tho rapidity of the tubercular process • as m very severe cases of acute general tuberculosis there may be numerous tuberclos, and very little inflammatory product while

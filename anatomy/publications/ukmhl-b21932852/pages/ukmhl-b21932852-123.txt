GRANULATIONS. 107 escaped from the blood, the walls of the vessels, from their simple -structure, favouring the escape of these elements. On the other hand, lit is not certain that some at least of the true granulation cells are . not escaped blood-cells. But no direct observations have been made on either of these points. Granulations, if healthy, tend to form connective tissue, which is of the kind called cicatricial, and is •seldom very perfect, having a tendency to contract.

With regard to epithelium, it is not :ertain that this is ever formed from granulations ; it is possible that it always arises from pre-existing epithelium.

Granulations, in fine, are the characteristic product of a productive or reconstructive inflammation, as nus is of a degenerative. 1

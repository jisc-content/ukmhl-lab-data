DISEASES OF THE VALVES OF THE HEART. 355 and also to calcareous degeneration, producing the calcification or : so-called ossification of the valves spoken of further on. These < changes may affect either the fibroid tissue resulting from acute ' endocarditis (as in rheumatism) or that produced by the more <• chronic changes which are sometimes called chronic inflammation ; and hence it is difficult or impossible to say, from their appearance s alone, whether the morbid changes of valves are due to an acute or to a chronic disease. Opacity ot the valves usually results from the chronic changes just described; and it often happens, as in atheroma of arteries, that the new growth is calcified. Some degree of opacity is very ecommon, especially in the anterior flap of the mitral, where a ■ yellow opaque patch is the rule in persons beyond middle life. It :is not impossible that this is produced by friction, as this flap appears often to touch the ventricular septum.* Atrophy of 1 alves. We have already alluded to perforation of tithe valves, as a result of endocarditis. Another form in which tithe same lesion occurs is in connection with atrophy. This is Fig. 83.

As to their consistency, also, broncho-pneumonic ; nodules are, though hard, less hard than miliary tubercles, and have not quite the same almost cartilaginous appearance When : found scattered through healthy lung tissue, they constitute the . disease called miliary hepatization by Virchow, which is one of the torms of so-called acute tuberculosis, seen in children. Microscopicai investigation, of course, reveals the fundamental ; distinction ; the broncho-pneumonic nodules giving on scraping . large catarrhal cells, some in a state of fatty degeneration •’ - glomeruli, granular matter, &c„ while from the miliary tubercle we obtain, by the same, only a few of the cell forms already described While on section it will be seen that in the one case ■ the solidification is caused by accumulation within the air cells • m the other by an interstitial growth.* Combination with Tubercles.—As might be expected, broncho- pneumonic granulations and tubercles are very frequently com- onit JZtimT \° “? be Clea^ distinguished; sometimes, on the othei hand, the tubercles may be, so to speak, concealed in ■huger broncho-pneumonic masses.

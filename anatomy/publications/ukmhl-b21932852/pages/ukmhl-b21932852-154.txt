138 NEW GROWTH OF MUCOUS TISSUE. round cells, which, sometimes give the tumour a “ medullary ” appearance. On examining the fluid which escapes, or a small frag- ment of the tumour, blood globules will be seen, but in fresh speci- mens hardly, it may be, anything else, the cellular elements being singularly pellucid. On treatment with carmine, &c., or sometimes without, stellate or multipolar cells are seen, which are fragments Eig. 17. in the larger corpuscles. Magnified 400 diameters. (Payne, “ Trans. Path. Soc.,” vol. xx., 1869.) of the cellular network. The tumour is seldom sufficiently solid to permit the cutting of a good section, but when this is possible the complete network of anastomosing cells is seen. There are always, beside these, round cells resembling those of embryonic tissue (or of granulations) which form no part of the network just spoken of. They exist in variable number, but when very numerous, produce a structure like that hereafter to be described as medullary sarcoma. Myxoma sometimes arises as a hyperplastic growth from the placenta, forming the well-known “uterine hydatids,” which consist of an outgrowth of the mucous tissue, which the tufts of the chorion, equally with the umbilical cord, normally contain. In other cases the growth must be called heteroplastic, and arises from the neuroglia (or connective tissue of nervous structures), subcutaneous connective tissue, from intermuscular septa, from various fasciae, from the sheaths of nerves, and from glandular

CYSTIC DISEASE OF THE OVARIES. 774 which may he recognized the remains of the yellow portion of the corpus luteurn. 2. Tubo-Ovarian Cysts are also developed from a follicle rup- tured at menstruation, hut from one to which the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube has become adherent. The ovarial portion of the cyst is lined by a yellow or brownish zone, repre- senting the corpus luteurn, which becomes continuous with the wall of the tube. Only a portion of this, about the outer third usually, participates in the cyst-formation, and the enlargement is not considerable. 3. Compound, or Multiloculnr Cysts ; Cystoid Disease of the Ovary. —The formation of these cysts is much more difficult to explain, and their relation to the simple cysts is uncertain. Before dis- cussing the numerous theories which have been framed to account for them, we must endeavour to describe the various forms in which they occur. These are the structures which usually give rise to “ ovarian dropsy,” hut similar symptoms may be produced by the simple cysts, if very large. Fig. 1S2. A mullilocular ovarian cyst, removed from a female, aged twenty-nine, during htc, by Mr. J. B. Brown. Septa form larger compartments, in which tlici'e is a secondan and tertiary growth of cysts. The tumour weighed 11 lbs. 3 oz. The following account is chiefly taken from Klob :— (a.) There may he one large, thick-walled cyst, in whose walls are contained smaller cysts, the shape of which is so modified by the presence of the large cavity, that they appear as if they had been formed by a splitting uo of—or at least in the thickness of—the wall of the main cyst. In other cases we find a cyst, the inner wall of which shows partitions, which either project boldly

314 NEUROMA. Pig. 78. case of multiple neuromata from the posterior tibial nerve, in which were cystic cavities, is recorded by Messrs. Van der Lyl and Snow Beck.* , „ „ ,, Painful Subcutaneous Tumour.—'This remarkable form of growth, the earliest account of which seems to have been given by Camper in 1760, though first fully described by Mr. Wood, in 1812, was at one time unhesitatingly reckoned as a neuroma. Later observers, unable to discover nerve fibres, describe it according to the structure which seemed to them predominant, as a vascular erectile tumour (Schuh), a muscular tumour, (Bill- roth), or a fibrous tumour (Paget). Nerve fibres can however generally be traced, and Virchow is inclined to think that some forms at least, stand in a close relation to neuroma.t Cancer and other malignant growths of nerves are rare, especiaHy as a primary affec- tion. When cancerous growth spreads into a nerve, it may infiltrate its structure without producing any very marked symptoms, simply separating, not destroying, the nerve fibres.! In the nerves of the senses we also meet with the primary formation of cancer. In the retina, medullary carcinoma, or some growth thus described," is not unfrequently found unassociated with cancerous growths in any other part of the system; but a primary cancer in this situation may give rise to secondary growths else- where The retina is also subject to a special form of morbid growth, viz., the glioma, otherwise confined to the nervous centres,§ doubtless often described as carcinoma. » “ Trans.

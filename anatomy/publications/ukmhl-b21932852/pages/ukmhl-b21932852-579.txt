(3) The nuclear deposits sometimes seem to give rise to cystic cavities, or these may form from dilatations of the tubes, or arise, de novo, as in other situations. (4) 1 ffhe mammillated condition appears to depend on a process of local atrophy, at least in most cases, the tubes being wasted in the track of the furrows, which mmetimes are so deep as to fissure the membrane down to its Cavity formed in the mucous membrane of stomach, by the disintegration of a nuclear mass.

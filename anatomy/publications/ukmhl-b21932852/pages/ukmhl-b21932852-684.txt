MOKBID ANATOMY OF THE URIXAEY APPARATUS. CHAPTER XXXYIII. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OF THE KIDNEYS. Congenital Anomalies.—The kidneys are very rarely absent entirely; but it is not uncommon to find one only. In this case Rokitansky makes a distinction between tbe unsymmetrical and tbe solitary kidney. Tbe former bas its usual position and shape, and is only larger than natural. Tbe solitary kidney is produced by tbe more or less complete fusion of tbe two organs together ; in its lowest degree it constitutes tbe borse-sboe kidney, tbe lower parts of each being connected by a band of renal substance pass- ing across tbe vertebral column. In tbe highest degree, there is only a single disc-bke kidney, lying in tbe median line, and situated much lower down, at tbe promontory, or in tbe concavity of tbe sacrum. When one kidney is absent, it is far more often tbe left than tbe right, in tbe proportion of 7 to 2. It may be absent altogether as well as tbe ureter and corresponding renal vessels, but sometimes a small mass of fibrous tissue with a renal vein and artery is seen surrounding a comparatively normal pelvis and ureter leading into tbe bladder. Anomalies of Position.—Tbe kidney is sometimes found much lower than its usual situation, either at tbe level of the promon- tory of tbe sacrum or quite in tbe pelvis, sometimes in the middle line. In such cases it is usually abnormal in form. This anomaly is doubtless congenital. Tbe moveable kidney lacks its usual attachment to tbe abdominal wall, or is suspended by a sort of mesentery formed by its peritoneal covering. Tbe vessels and ureter are usually normal. It occurs more frequently in women than in men, and more often on tbe right side than the left. Hypertrophy and Atrophy.—Hypertrophy of one kidney is always observed when tbe other is destroyed or its function interfered

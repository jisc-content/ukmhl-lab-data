399 EMBOLISM. Variations are produced by accidental circumstances, such as position, influencing the venous circulation,' the force of the heart, the possible coagulation of blood in the veins, and the like. It should not be forgotten that total obstruction of an artery by t thrombosis will have the same consequences as when it is pro- duced by an embolus. Partial obstruction appears to produce . gradual necrosis rather than hremorrhagic infarction. In the retina the shape of the organ and the arrangement of the vessels lead to a superficial ecchymosis being produced instead of a 1 wedge-shaped block. Subsequent Transformation of the Hcemorrliagic Infarctus—- • Engorgement and iuemorrhage do not avert, though they may delay, the necrosis which is the necessary consequence of inter- rupted nutrition. Hence a hremorrhagic block passes through a ' series of necrobiotic changes ending with absorption. The central parts become pale, crumbling, and ultimately soft; and this change extends towards the periphery; on the other hand, the parts immediately surrounding the block become inflamed, and fibrous tissue is produced, which may form something resembling a capsule. The changes much resemble those of actual thrombi. * -e central parts may soften into puriform matter, but true sup- I pniation does not occur; ultimately nothing remains but a cica- . tncial mass of newly- formed tissue, which by its contraction and - shrivelling usually forms a depression on the surface of the organ.

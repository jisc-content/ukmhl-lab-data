789 THE MALE MAMMA. The male breast is occasionally the seat of non-malignant and malignant growths. We have ourselves met with an instance of the former in a gentleman aged twenty-one, which to the touch closely resembled one of hypertrophy of the mammary gland; it was of the size of a shilling, felt semi-cartilaginous, as if com- posed of lacteal ducts, and was adherent to the skin of the nipple. The individual had perceived it six weeks before applying for advice ; it gave no pain, and four months later we were informed that it had almost disappeared without any active treatment being pui'sued. This is in accordance with the structure of the male mamma, which Sir A. Cooper has shown to resemble the female gland, though in a rudimentary state. Nor could we otherwise account for the well-authenticated cases of the secretion of milk by men. Mr. Birkett gives delineations, showing the male gland to have all the essential elements requisite for the performance of the function. Mr. Stanley* relates the case of a man, aged forty-five, who was affected with cancer of the right humerus, secondary to cancer of the right breast. Cruveilhier states that three cases have come under his observation, one of which is delineated in his atlas, t In the College of Surgeons (prep. 2,791) there is the section of the breast of a man with a very vascular ulcer, five inches in diameter, probably originating in a lens-shaped, hard cancerous tumour, or a degeneration of the skin and mammary gland. The mono- graphs on diseases of the mamma also contain records of simple cysts, compound cysts, and encysted tumours, occurring in the male breast; but they belong to the mere curiosities of medical experience. Pleiomazia, or excess in the number of mammfe, has been observed very rarely in men ; more commonly in women.

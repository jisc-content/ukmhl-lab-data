670 HYPER-ffiMIA OF THE KIDNEY. consisting of a granular or homogeneous material entangling blood globules, and often some detached particles of epithelium. Acute Hypercemia.—A kidney in the state of hypenemia, which we have above described, or somewhat approaching to it, with fibrinous exudation in the tubes, is considered by I renchs as in the first stage of Bright’s disease; we greatly doubt if this is generally the case, and cannot look upon hyperaunia as a necessary element in the morbid process. Dr. Johnson considers the same condition as the result of acute desquamative nephritis, and believes that Fio. 153. Drawing of red deposit from urine in intense renal hyperemia. complete recovery may not unfrequently take place. In this we quite agree with him, and so, we think, would most observers. He differs, therefore, from Frerichs, in not considering the hyper- eemic condition as constituting the first stage of Bright s disease. The urine produced by kidneys in this state is very characteristic; it is of a rather deep, smoky-red colour, with a copious dark- reddish deposit, consisting of blood corpuscles, renal epithelium, and fibrinous casts entangling more or less of the latter. t-ome- times corpuscles are present which resemble those of pus, ana like them have compound nuclei. The appearance of this deposit wrU be best understood by reference to the accompanying figure, ine hmmatine of the blood globules exudes from them, and gives the neculiar red colour to the urine, which is at the same time scan j and loaded with albumen. For some time after the hffimorrh^e has ceased, casts of the tubes, which become, however, more delicate and pale, traces of renal epithelium, and albume still discoverable in the urine, until recovery is complete.

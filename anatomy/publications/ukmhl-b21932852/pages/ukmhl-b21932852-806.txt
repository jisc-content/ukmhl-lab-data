CHAPTER XLIII. MORBID CONDITIONS FOLLOWING AND PRECEDING PARTURITION. It is immediately after parturition that the uterus, which during pregnancy has become, as it were, the focus of the entire system, and having completed the great cycle of its duties, is required to lapse into its previous dormant state,—it is while the organ is yet the seat of increased vascular action, and its proper functions may be said to have ceased, that morbid influences are received with facility, and produce destructive and often rapidly fatal conse- quences. After the enormous evolution which the uterus during pregnancy undergoes, it has, when parturition has occurred, to go through changes in the way of involution which are sometimes imperfectly effected. There are two states which are more par- ticularly liable to supervene immediately after parturition, which are each of them a source of danger, by the haemorrhage they give rise to. The one is atony or defective contraction ; the other, spasm or irregular contraction of the uterus. In the one case we find the uterus maintaining its dilated condition, its walls are flabby and soft; in the other, various irregular forms, to which the term hour- glass contraction has been applied, present themselves. PUERPERAL INFLAMMATIONS. The inflammations occurring in the puerperal state may be classified as local and general. The latter constitute what is generally known as puerperal fever, though this term is used with a certain amount of laxity and sometimes applied to conditions properly described as local diseases. Local Inflammations.—These, when occurring after parturition, have considerable similarity to those which occur in the unim- pregnated uterus. They may be described under the corre- sponding heads of Puerperal Endometritis, Metritis, Perimetritis, and Parametritis ; with corresponding inflammations of the ovaries and Fallopian tubes.

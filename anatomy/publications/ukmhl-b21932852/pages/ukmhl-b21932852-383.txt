MALFORMATIONS OF THE VALVES. S67 ; in such cases there is always evidence of some serious defect in the 1 heart. It often happens, however, that an open foramen ovale is 1 found after death in persons who have presented no symptoms ' whatever of disordered circulation during life. The commonest form of imperfection is when the membranous t curtain covers the opening entirely, but there is a “valvular” i opening through which a probe can be obliquely passed. This does : not, in all probability, at all interfere with the functions of the : heart, so long as the blood pressure remains (which it must be normally) equal on both sides. If, however, any cause, such as obstruction in the lungs, produce a higher pressure on one side of : the septum, blood may pass from one auricle to the other. By this inequality of pressure, combined with the consequent dila- tation of the auricle, the exent of the opening will be greatlv increased. o j The form of defect which we believe to be of practical import- ance, and to be in all probability never repaired, is when the c curtain leaves a crescent-shaped opening at its lower border bbeing attached only by two pillars at the corners; and, further’ ■has two or three perforations arranged in a curved line above’ llhe curtain is at the same time usually very thin. This form of vvalve we have seen both in infants dying soon after birth with obviously imperfect circulation, and in adults who have suffered tirroni dyspnoea and some degree of cvanosis. MALFORMATIONS OF THE VALVES. The valves frequently present a congenital arrest, or excess of ivelopment, sometimes independent of any other malformation of * “ Report of the Pathol.

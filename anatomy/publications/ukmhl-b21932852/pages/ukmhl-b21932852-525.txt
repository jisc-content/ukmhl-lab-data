CHRONIC PHTHISIS (MIXED AND TUBERCULAR). 509 of ail ordinary abscess. It may produce on the one band pus, on the other hand permanent connective tissue. The former is shown by the profuse expectoration so often seen in phthisis, the latter in the firm walls which enclose old vomicae in the lung and the induration of surrounding tissue. The greater smoothness of the internal surface, and the firmness of the walls, distinguish old from recent cavities. Dilatations of the bronchial tubes complicate and enlarge cavities in varying degrees. Many cavities doubtless commence in bronchial dilatations, accompanied or not by ulcer- ation of the walls. Fio. 116. The aP?x of a. lung containing numerous cavities, with tubercular and caseous products intervening. The large cavity, and several of the smaller ones, are lined with an adventitious membrane. In the majority of instances both lungs are found to present excavations. Louis states that in one-sixth only of his total cases of phthisis, they were limited to one or the other lung, and when ■ present on both sides were of different size; in somewhat less than one-tenth of his cases, both lungs were the seat of enormous exca- vations, equally largo on both sides, and in another tenth, where the cavities presented but small or moderato dimensions, these dimen- sions were the samo in both organs. Largo cavities (of the size of a goose’s egg or a clenched fist) Louis found to occur in about one- half of the cases, and with equal frequency in each lung; in the ■remainder of his subjects ho found cavities of tho size of an :ordinary-sized apple or walnut.

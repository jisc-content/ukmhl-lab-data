CYSTS IN TIIE KIDNEY. 090 Gouty Deposits in the Kidney.—In contracted granular kidneys it is not uncommon to find, chiefly in the pyramids, white lines and specks of mineral matter which, on microscopical examination, are found to consist of masses of urate of soda, like those of ordinary gouty deposits. These masses are imbedded in the thickened fibroid matrix, not contained in the tubes; though under certain circumstances masses of urates may be found in the latter situation. The deposit is sometimes granular, but more often in Fro. 163. Tufts of aeicular crystals, composed of urate of soda from the matrix of a granular kidney. the form of stellate bunches of aeicular crystals, as shown in Fig. 163. This condition often accompanies general gout; some- times when no symptoms of gout have occurred, similar deposits will be found in the articular cartilages of the great toe. Some- times it is alleged to be the solitary gouty deposit in the body. To make a special form of kidney disease—arthritic nephritis— on these appearances, as has been done by some French and (rerman pathologists, appears to us quite unnecessary; since m London, at least, many of the most pronounced granular kidneys are gout w A certain proportion of the gouty cases are associated with lead poisoning. CYSTS IN THE KIDNEY". We proceed to the consideration of the cystic growth which often takes place so abundantly in diseased kidneys. These formations

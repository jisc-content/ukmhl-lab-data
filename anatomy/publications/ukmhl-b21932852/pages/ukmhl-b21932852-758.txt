THE PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. CHAPTER XL. THE EXTERNAL ORGANS OE GENERATION. In the labia, suggillations are frequently met with as a result of external violence, or after parturition ; the effusion from a violent injury may give rise to very considerable tumefaction, which must not be confounded with varicose swellings. When the consequence of childbirth, it generally affects the left labium,* and occurs more frequently in pnmipane than multiparse. The swelling in either case has been known to attain the size of a fist, or a child’s head. It presents a tense, smooth surface, with a livid colour. Varicose veins of the labia may also acquire a very considerable size; but the slow increase of the tumour, and the vermicular character of its contents, together with the ready compressibility of the swell- ing, will determine the diagnosis. Varicose swellings, too, occur during the course of pregnancy, and, though sometimes very con- siderable, do not generally cause any impediment to parturition, as they are external to the vulva. Cases, however, are recorded of their sudden laceration during parturition, and of a consequent fatal issue. The haemorrhagic tumour disappears spontaneously, or in consequence of treatment, but exceptionally the swelling persists, probably becoming encysted, and may then be borne for an indefinite period. A case is related by Mauriceau,t in which a tumour, originating in this way, existed for twenty-five years. A ready explanation of the common occurrence both of large blood extravasations and varicose swellings is to be found in the fact that the vaginal veins are destitute of valves. A form of atresia vaginae, not unfrequently met with amongst infants, and occasionally suffered to persist until adult life, is * “Ejlian, die Geburtslehre,” &c., vol. ii. p. 617, 1840.

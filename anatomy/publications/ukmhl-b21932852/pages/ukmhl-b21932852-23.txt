RED AND 'WHITE CORPUSCLES. 7 or colourless, -which in the healthy state occur somewhat “ few and far between,” in number only ^igthto 3-^th of the red, and impart to the general mass no distinguishable quality. Healthy blood has an alkaline reaction, which is that of the liquor sanguinis, and is, even in the thinnest layers, quite opaque. The exact proportion of the organized particles to the liquor is extremely difficult to determine with accuracy. Most analyses refer only to the dried corpuscles, but that of Hoppe, which takes account of the water contained in these particles, is by far the most trustworthy. It is an analysis, not of human blood, but of the venous blood of the horse. In 1,000 parts of blood are contained— Corpuscles .. 326-2 Liquor sanguinis .. 673-8 1000 In 1,000 parts of corpuscles— Water .. .. •‘165 Solids 435 1000 In 1,000 parts of liquor sanguinis— Water .. 908-4 Solids 91-6 1000 The solids of the liquor sanguinis consist of— Fibrin 101 Albumen .. .. 77-6 Fat 1-2 Extractives 4-0 Soluble salts 6-4 Insoluble salts 1-7 101 Bed Corpuscles.—These aro round discoid bodies, with two concave surfaces. Their consistence is soft and elastic; they are of a uniform red colour, and are specifically heavier than either the liquor or the white corpuscles. They were formerly supposed to be cells, with a distinct envelope and a nucleus ; subsequently the possession of a nucleus was denied to them, and they aro now regarded as homogeneous masses of colourless stroma, without nucleus or enclosing membrane. Many reagents, by condensing the outermost portion of the globule, produce tho appearance of a cell-wall. The colour of these discs is duo to the presence in thorn of a peculiar colouring matter, which is normally quite absent from tho liquor, and may be separated from tho discs without

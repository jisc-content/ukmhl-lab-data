472 PULMONARY II2EMORRHAGE. aneurism, are not well understood. To this form, as resembling cerebral apoplexy, the term pulmonary apoplexy might most reasonably be applied, especially as it is usually fatal. The name has, however, by custom been assigned to a different con- dition. Haemorrhage, more or less extensive, also occurs in pulmonary phthisis; of which more will be said in the proper place. The commonest form of haemorrhage is that which occurs in circumscribed masses, and is always associated with disease of the heart, or embolism—viz., the haemorrhagic infarctus, or pulmonary apoplexy. Haemorrhagic Infarctus, or Pulmonary Apoplexy.—Thus form of haemorrhage is distinct from that which occui’s from the bronchial mucous membranes, either owing to an adynamic state of the blood or to active congestion, both in the symptoms it produces during life, as well as in the post-mortem appearances. The seat of pul- monary apoplexy is the parenchyma of the lung, blood being effused into the infundibula and into the air vesicles themselves, Fio. 103. Pulmonary apoplexy, occurring in a man aged fifty-three. There were several apoplectic masses, exhibiting a deep purple, almost black hue, and causing a homogeneous solid appearance of the part affected, as shown in the section. but not usually spreading so far as into the bronchi. The apoplectic spot may be folt before the lung is cut into as a globular or wedge-shaped mass, of greater density than the surrounding tissue, and, if near the surface, its darker colour also attracts attention, while there is usually inflammation and thickening of tho pleural surface over it. On section, we find, if the haemorrhage be recent, a dark red, almost black, homogeneous, circumscribed spot, varying in sizo from a pin’s head to an orange, of the appear- ance and consistency of damson cheese, bounded by tissue, which is

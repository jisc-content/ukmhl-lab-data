385 STATISTICS OF ANEURISM. rism, though apparently of exactly the same nature as that lining the arteries, differs from it in not presenting any epithelium. This so-called membrane is in fact the condensed external layer of the coagulum, similar to that which forms on the surface of old clots Fio. 92. Section of the arch of an aorta, with an aneurism arising from its upper part. The cavity of the sac is nearly filled by laminated coagulum, the internal membrane of the artery is thickened. The sac presses against the trachea, the aiteria innominata, and the right carotid and subclavian arteries. (St. Bartholomew’s Museum, Series xiii. No. 11.) in veins. It is not, properly speaking, organized. The coagula form in proportion as the sac is cut off from the rest of the circu- lation ; the more shallow it is, and therefore the more exposed to the force of the current, the less the liability to the formation of fibrinous laminae, and the less, we may also add, the coincident danger of perforation of the coats of the vessel. It is through the agency of this deposit that a spontaneous cure may take place, either by an obliteration of the sac, or by pressure upon the artery' and consequent obliteration of its channel. The coagula may subsequently undergo secondary metamorphoses, such as a conver- sion into cholesterine, or cretaceous matter. But they do not always form, and we may meet with a series of aneurisms on the same vessel, some of which present coagula, while others are empty. Statistics of Aneurism.—In number and size thore is a great diversity, as also with regard to the liability of different arteries to be affected, as well as in respect of sex. The following table c c

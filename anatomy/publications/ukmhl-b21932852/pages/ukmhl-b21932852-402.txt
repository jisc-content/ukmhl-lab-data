STATISTICS OF ANEURISM. 3SG contains an analysis of sixty-three cases, examined by Mr. Hodg- son, which illustrates the last two points. It shows at once the great liability of the male sex, and the prevailing tendency of certain arteries to be affected : Ascending aorta, innoininata and arch of the aorta . Femoral and popliteal Inguinal Descending aorta Subclavian and axillary .... Carotid Stales. Females.

Thepro. clivity to aneurism is also determined by the age of mdi^dnal^ it is unknown to childhood ; the greatest tendency to the disease exists at the middle period of life, as shown by the following analysis of 108 cases : From 10 to 19 vears 1 subject j From 50 to 59 years 14 subjects. 20 29" „ 15 „ I ,, 60 „ 69 „ 8 So; 39 ;; 35 „ : „ ™g „ 40 49 ,, 31 - ' 80 ,, 89 „ - » Dr Crisn t found in 551 cases collected from journals and 364 ±Jl‘ 1 ' -r . j TV T,-.4-1-wx -Prill mm Tl O’ BiniinftrS 1 ' ' 1 Cases in Journals. 175 59 Abdominal aorta , 137 Popliteal artery ' 66 25 23 20 Tunominate artery 18 11 7 s Other systemic arteries 2 [ 551 Museum Specimens. *207 46 50 12 9 12 3 S 10 1 4 364 » The table is essentially the Fame as that aneurisms by Tanned.

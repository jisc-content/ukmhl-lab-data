THE PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. CHAPTER XLV. Congenital Malformations—There may be (1) deficiencies, (2) excessive development, (3) imperfect union of parts, (4) fusion of separate parts, (5) too early or too late development. 1. Defective formation is seen in imperfectly-formed monsters: in the occasional deficiency of a limb or limbs, of fingers, of vertebrae, or other single bones. 2. Excessive development in the occasional monstrous growth of particular bones or limbs, and in the production of supernumerary fingers or other parts. There must, of course, in both these cases, be some corresponding deficiency or excess of the soft parts. 3. Imperfect union of parts is seen in such deformities as cleft palate and spina bifida. 4. Fusion of separate parts is sometimes seen in the union of tones of two fingers or toes into one, or of the bones of the skull. •• Premature development occurs sometimes in the cranial bones and in those of the limbs, causing too early union of the sutures, and premature union of epiphyses ; retarded development is seen in the late closing of the fontanelles of the skull, and the late union of epiphyses in the long bones. Premature synostosis of the -ranial sutures is commonly regarded as a cause of small develop- ment of the head, or “microcephalism.” Dr. Langdon Down lowever, after examining 200 microcephalic skulls, contends that the sole cause is imperfect development of the brain, the sutures being generally unossified. INFLAMMATION OF BONE. This does not essentially differ from inflammations of soft parts though, of course, the naked-eye appearance presents certain

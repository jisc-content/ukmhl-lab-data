307 PARASITES. Bokitansky states that he has repeatedly met with cysticercus in : tho cervical portion of the spinal marrow; but his experience ; agrees with that of Ollivier, that they do not occur in the substance • of the medulla. They in most instances are situated externally to :the dura mater. In this case it is manifest that they had been first i developed outside the column, and had forced their way in through t the intervertebral foramina; they have, however, also been found ■ within and underneath the arachnoid. In what Dr. Oobbold calls the most remarkable case of develop- i ment of cysticerci within the human body on record, among two : thousand parasites found in the body, one was in the medulla oblongata. Hydatid cysts are very rarely found in the cord. According to :Davaine, three cases have been recorded. Dr. Cobbold has met ■ with an anonymous record of one case.

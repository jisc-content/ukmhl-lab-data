579 WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINE. the in.estine attached to its base, which becomes strangulated by being twisted round the mesentery. “ One portion of the intes- tine either single or double—a coil—may afford the axis round which another portion with its mesentery is thrown, so as to be throughout in contact with the circumference of the axis and thus to compress it like a ferule. A coil of small intestine, the sigmoid flexure, or the caecum, may form the axis.” Abnormal length of the mesentery probably predisposes to these affections. More frequent than the foregoing, are the instances in which a portion of intestine, generally the small, becomes strangulated in consequence of having got into one of the following situations : (1) into the Assure of Winslow ; (2) into an opening in the mesentery; o d^rra m the °mentum; (4) into spaces included by coided bands of false membrane, and various parts of the abdo- minal viscera ; (o) into similar spaces formed by a long vermiform appendage, or intestinal diverticulum. b Tr tl10 rectum have keen known to be compressed ti b tl'1C ed,b^ a mass of loaded small intestine lying1 upon fcZ ^al/eferS t0 f,CUri0US pase “ which the'\ransverse , c-kild of six months old, was compressed between the occmatTvmv tllu vel'teb^li coliimn.

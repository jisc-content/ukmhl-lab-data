COAGULATION OF BLOOD IN TIIE HEABT. 352 stituents of tlie clot itself are arranged. If the red corpuscles are uniformly distributed through the fibrinous network, so that the whole resembles an ordinary clot formed out of the bod}, its appearance supplies no reason for thinking that it was formed before death If, on the other hand, the constituents are sepa- Jated we must look at the manner in which they are arranged, ci 5 • fiaaf thorp is a layer of yellow fibrine in that part « W*" *»*> “-PPcrmort. and that the lower parts contain red corpuscles, the arrange ment is evidently the work of gravitation, as in the buffj Tat which sometimes forms in the bleeding basin after yene- .• i there is no around for supposmg the coagu.a tfotTo^ave been 'ante-mortem.

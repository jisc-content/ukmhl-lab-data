181 GENERAL REMARKS ON CANCER. OCCUJ-S in combination with one or other of the species of cancer chiefly with encephaloid: the cysts may be simple or compound’ liiese cysto-carcmomatous growths arise in various ways • either a production of cancer tissue takes in the wall or the cavity of a pre-existing cyst; or cysts are formed by dilatation of natural cavities (as glandular acini) contained in the cancerous growth • or else some softening or colloid transformation of cells causes’the production of cysts from the cancerous elements themselves. y illous Cancer.—Rokitansky describes a variety of cancer, which he calls villous, from its consisting of a kind of delicate fibrous stalk branching at its end into villous processes, with somewhat bulbous terminations. They grow on the internal surface of natural cavities, and are extremely vascular. Hemorrhage often takes place spontaneously from them, and is easily excited by the havingfhleS1°n' ls Probable that many innocent tumours, having the same form have been confounded under this name1 but many cases are undoubtedly cancerous.

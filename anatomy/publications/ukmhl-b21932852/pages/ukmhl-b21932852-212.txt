196 TUBERCLE. resembling very minute lymphatic glands, which he has been the first to observe in many organs.* Gaseous Material or Yellow Tubercle.—The substance whicn has been called yellow tubercle forms masses of varying size, but Caseous material or “ yellow tubercle.” generally larger than grey tubercle, equalling perhaps a hemp- feed, or a pea, in magnitude; but masses much larger thanthm occur in the brain, and in lymphatic glands, bo httle uniformity is there in the size or mode of growth of these masses ^ more natural to speak of yellow tubercle as a substance 1that n. as tuberculous matter, than of a yellow tubercle or tubercles. This yellow substance has also been called scrofulous matter, an since both these names may give rise tonusunderstandm .ome writers prefer to speak of it simply as cheesy matter. Whatever ™ be taken of the origin of the two forms of so-called tubercle there is an obvious convenience m denotinQ them by different names; and it therefore seems more convenient to reserve the name tubercle for the grey form, and to call^the.yelfow cbppsv masses simply caseous material. It is an opaque subota ff a Ssh-yeUow colour, and of rather brittle consistence. AL- cro=c^mcal examination shows it to consist of amorphous rnole- fufos many fotty granules, and small, shrivelled, angfoar bodi^ preserXg a good deal of cell form which are in r^ity atrophied and withered lymph or pus-corpuscles. These are the ^ “tubercle corpuscles” of Lebert, at one tune o g gnostic of tubercle. (Seo Fig* 4b.) • “ Eleventh Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council for lSos. Londo 1809.

498 BRONCHO-PNEUMONIC GRANULATIONS. tubercles in being bard, resistent, grey, and often translucent, tbougb readily becoming yellow and opaque. Tbe points of difference between these structures and tubercles are as followsThey are somewhat larger, being generally as much as one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and often more, so that their minimum size is equal to, or greater than, the maximum of miliary tubercles. Then the arrangement of broncho-pneumonic masses is quite characteristic, being (as we have already pointed out) determined by the fact that the air spaces connected with one terminal bronchiole are simultaneously affected, and hence the group is like a cluster of nodules attached to a single stem. When such a group of granulations becomes confluent, it forms a mass which may be grey, but is more likely to have become yellow and opaque, while it has the characteristic shape of lobular pneumonia. On the pleural surface these granulations (called racemose by some writers) have a polygonal outline (Fig. 112). True miliary tubercles never become confluent into a considerable mass of the same kind 1 Fig. 112.

Hence nodules which are m immediate connec- tion with masses of the same structure must be broncho-pneumonic, not tubercular.

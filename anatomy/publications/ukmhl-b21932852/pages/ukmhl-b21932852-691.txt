675 BLOCKS IN THE KIDNEY. uncertain. Dr. Dickinson also attributes the inflammation to the absorption of septic matter from the urine (“ Med.-Ohir. Trans.,” yol. lvi. p. 223). The extension of renal abscesses may go on until the whole organ is converted into a mere pouch of pus ; in this case, or even before the organ is quite destroyed, the abscess may make its way by the usual process of absorption, penetrating through surround- ing indurated tissue, and evacuate its contents in either of the following situations:—(1) Externally into the lumbar region; (2) into the cavity of the peritoneum; (3) into the ascending or descending colon, or into the duodenum; (4) into the bronchi after perforation of the diaphragm. Acute inflammation of the kidney may become chronic, or the inflammation may have a chronic character from the outset; its results may be suppuration or induration, and consecutive atrophy of the organ. Suppuration in the tissue surrounding the kidney, or perine- phritis, is generally the consequence of wounds or injuries, or of the extension of inflammation from neighbouring parts. (2) Pycemic abscesses, if they occur in the kidney, are similar to those in other organs, and do not call for any special remark. Two conditions which may be confounded with them must, however, be mentioned:—Infarctions, or fibrinous blocks, and capillary embolisms. Infarctions or Blocks.—These lesions correspond generally to Fig. 154. Blocks in a granular kidney. The situation of the patch is marked by the irregular outline, which was a deep red.

376 CHRONIC ARTERITIS, OR ATHEROMATOUS DISEASE. parts. At tliis period of the disease the inner coat of the artery appears irregularly thickened or elevated by masses of a greyish translucent material, looking as if deposited upon its surface. Care- ful examination, however, shows that the seemingly adventitious material is really continuous with and formed from the inner coat of the artery. The innermost lining, or endothelium, may generally be traced uninterruptedly, but the thickening affects the iiitrma proper, and not the middle coat. The material is, when newly formed, greyish, translucent, and sometimes like cartilage in appearance, in general resembling the substance of the translucent nodules formed on the valves of the heart m acute endocarditis.

This translucency and grey colour of the material are soon lost, and it becomes yellow and opaque. This change, which is owing to the deposition of fatty molecules in the substance, marks l commencement of the second stage. It is the condition which we most commonly recognize as atheromatous degeneration ot me arteries, but where it occurs, evidences of moro adwnc^forms of degeneration are also invariably present. ' changes assume one of two forms: either fat > < j (atheromatous degeneration properly so called), or calcareous mAdvanS forty degeneration, of which the earlier stage, as we

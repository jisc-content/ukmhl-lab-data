Tt yerv rarely happens that individuals die of an affection residing solely in the -nerves; consequently we are left to surmise from analogy their morbid appearances in those diseases m which thej are manifestly affected. At the same time we must never forget that the nerves are not central organs, but that they are the tel®" graphic wires destined to convey intelligence to and from the central organs. When, therefore, we have to deal with a nervous symptom we must first inquire whether it be due to a centric or to a1 peripheral cause, or, in other words, whether the nerve is propagating a morbid impression from the brain, the spina marrow, oi° the sympathetic ganglia which may simulate periph- eral disease, or whether it is giving evidence of local <frse*» by producing in the brain the consciousness of that affection. n the maiority of instances of irregular or painful action of the nerv“ we should be as much in error in seeking for the cause of the derangement iu the nerve itself, as if, when our galvanic battery does not act, owing to the trough containing no acid, we sought to remedy the defect by changing the conducting wires. The nerves have repeatedly been made the subject oi mqm.m diseases in which either local symptoms predominate, or from the known physiological action of the nerves, controlling , pnted the morbid phenomena could fairly he soughi in ai fnfoitoi “Z!

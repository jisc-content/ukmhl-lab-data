8UPPTTK ATI ON. 102 epithelial cells appear as if they had originated there. This ex- planation is supported by the most recent observers, among whom may be mentioned Bizzozero.* In suppuration of serous membranes it has been asserted, and also denied that the pus-cells arise from proliferation of the serous epithelial cells (or endothelia). The same is true of the connective tissue cells. Fig. 11 Glomeruli and granular cells. 1 From ovarian cyst. 2, From cancer of breast. 3, From inflamed lung. 4, From inflamed pia mater. 5, From a case of tuberculous meningitis. The opaque cells are the glomeruli, the more simply granulous are the granular cells. In the nervous centres the origin of pu3-cells has been referred to the elements of the neuroglia, or connective tissue stroma. In glandular organs they have been traced both to the glandular secreting cells and to the fibrous stroma. Tn connective tissue structures, such as cartilage, bone, tendon, their proper cells, and in the cornea the branched corneal corpuscles have had the same function assigned them. In the skin suppu- ration has been referred both to the deep layers of the epidermis and to the connective tissue of the true skin. Other Constituents of Pus.—The formed elements contained in pus, beside pus-cells, are free nuclei, derived from the disinte- gration of cells, red blood-corpuscles, and often what are called glomeruli or granule-cells. There are also many fatty molecules. The granule-cell, exudation globule, or glomerulus, which was first described by Gluge, and called by him the compound in- flammatory globule, is very frequently present in exudation, and is, speaking generally, a valuable sign of the existence of the inflammatory process, but not an infallible one. The granule-cell is usually of large size, from — iron mostly spherical, but often oblong, or of irregular shape. By transmitted light they • Strieker’s “ Meclizimscke JiUirlttcher,” 1ST2.

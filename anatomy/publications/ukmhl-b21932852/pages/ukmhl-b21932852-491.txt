CHAPTER XXXII. « PNEUMONIA. Several morbid states have been called by this name, but it more especially belongs to that form of inflammation in which the air- cells are filled with fibrinous exudation and leucocytes. This is the disease distinguished as lobar, croupous, or fibrinous pneumonia. LOBAR PNEUMONIA. This inflammation of the pulmonary tissue is commonly assumed to present three stages, which we may trace in regular succession m the patient, or which we find co-existing at various portions of the lungs in the same dead subject. The first stage, that of con- gestion or engorgement, we have already considered ; its situation, its effect upon the cohesion ot the tissues, the co-existence of other inflammatory changes, and the history of the case must assist us in determining its character, though it is often difficult to be certain riU'e- r^e general effect of acute inflammation in altering the cohesion of the tissues, is a point of considerable importance ; when it particularly affects, as Sir Robert Carswell has pointed out, the uniting connective tissue element, it may thus demonstrate the previous existence of inflammation, though the redness and vascu- R L ?Ve ^appeared, or but faintly mark the degree of alteration which the disease has effected in the process of nutrition. This general law is compatible with the observation that the second 8t!p® pneumonia, or hepatization, is accompanied by a state of solidification; for, as the author named remarks, though the tissues feel harder than natural when compressed, the diminution ot cohesion which has taken place between their anatomical ele- ments, is rendered conspicuous by the facility with which thev are penetrated, broken down, or crushed. In doubtful cases the microscope would aid us by determinimr the presence or absence, in the congested portion, of exudation corpusdes, which we find where the naked eye fails in distinguish- ing the existence of inflammation.

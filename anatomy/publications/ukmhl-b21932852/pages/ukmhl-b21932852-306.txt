2 gQ THE SPINAL COED AND ITS MEMBRANES. frprmpnt dancer • we may fairly assume this as a reason why the Smater of the Spinal column is only very loose y attached to the vertebral canal; on which account it allows of an accumu- lation of fluid on its external surface, such as we but rarelj meet with in the brain. Owing to the firm attachment of the dura mater to the occipital foramen, fluids accumulated at tins.part are nrevented passing into the cranial cavity, while there is a tree communication between the arachnoidal spaces of the two cavities. This fact is one that must not be overlooked in moroul aflections both of the spine and the encephalon ; independent of the Flec- tion that the arachnoidal fluid affords to the cord, it is an eviden means of securing a balance in the circulation in the nervous centres while, on” the other hand, a derangement m its quantity and site may be alone sufficient to produce serious symptoms, which the morbid anatomist would be unable to measure iy Mater.—We possess no evidence of the occurrence disease of the vertebra, and the eitension of psoas abscess, may meninges.

(ilG CONGESTION. extreme* cases, almost destroyed: in part, they are gorged with yellow matter to such a degree that they appear as opaque masses. The quantity of yellow matter thus formed is far greater than any that exists in healthy states of the organ, and, as some of it is doubtless absorbed and carried into the blood, we find in this circumstance somo explanation of the icteric hue which is so often observed in such patients. The connection which certainly exists between the congestion and the yellow engorgement of the cells, as cause and effect, gives additional support to the opinion that the yellow bile-pigment is a modification of, and derived from, the colouring matter of the blood. Like venous congestion in general, congestion of the liver from cardiac disease, produces first enlargement, which may often be recognized during life, and later on wasting, dependent, doubtless, on the imperfect nutrition of the organ. With this is ■ associated some amount of induration, though less than is pro- • duced by some other causes. Generally at the post-mortem, exami- • nation we find the liver rather small than large, hard, and with i the characteristic nutmeg appearance. ... , ,. Chronic Congestion, Nutmeg Liver.—This consists, m its best marked: instances, of deep reddish-brown congestion, forming patches - and streaks occupying the central parts of the lobules, and sur- - rounded by patches of a greyish, or yellowish white colour. The congested portions are most definitely limited, and the contrast: Fio. 139.

This partly depends on the circumstance that the portions thus devou of blood are affected with fatty degeneration or infiltration, a change which, by causing the cells to increase m bulk, occasions

CHAPTER VI. TUBERCLE AND ALLIED PRODUCTS. We have here to consider certain morbid products which have been sometimes classified as a peculiar kind of exudation, sometimes as new growths, sometimes as inflammatory products. They occupy as we believe an intermediate place between the two latter. They . include—(1) Tubercle; (2) Products of constitutional syphilis; (3) Lupus; (4) Morbid products of glanders, and, perhaps, other specific diseases. TUBERCLE. The term tubercle has been applied to objects so different that when the extremes are compared it will seem surprising that they should have ever been denoted by the same term. There are, how- ever, two principal classes of these objects, distinguished as grey and yellow tubercle. f/rey MMary Tubercle.—The former, sometimes called grey granu- lations, arc about the average size of a millet-seed, but vary from j^in. to 5L(Jin. in diameter, roundish, resisting under pressure, of a greyish, semi-transparent as- pect. The microscope shows thorn to consist of nuclei, small simple cells, and some larger cells with many nuclei. The existence of freo nuclei has been denied by some writers, but we often find very 8mall bodies in which no method of treatment exhibits a nucleus; and which therefore seem to bo nuclei themselves. The predomi- nant elements are, undoubtedly, ■ small cells from about to^in. in diameter, consisting Fig. 44. 6& r<? Elements from grey tubercle ; miliary granulation.

CANCER OF TIIE UTERES. 7C9 seldom the sloughing action spreads beyond the line of new growth, and after death considerable portions of vagina and uterus are found softened, green, and sloughing. The tendency to affection of the lymphatic glands, and to the occurrence of secondary growths in remote parts of the body, has for the most part escaped the detailed notice of writers on the sub- ject. In Mr. Arnott’s fifty-seven cases of autopsies of uterine i cancer already referred to, the lymphatic glands were involved in twenty cases, and in eleven the viscera contained secondary ; growths. His observations seem to show that these multiple foci oi disease are far more common in carcinoma and sarcoma, although in the later stages of epithelioma the glands may occasionally s suffer. Besides these ordinary varieties of uterine cancer, papilloma of the mucous membrane of the os and cervix may be met with, the i normal papillae becoming greatly hypertrophied with thickened I layers of investing epithelium, but without any infiltration of the ‘ epithelial elements amongst the deeper tissues. We have seen also a general villous condition of the linino- mucous membrane formiug soft vegetations projecting into the ' caT1.^ °* the uterus, and showing under the microscope branching ] papulae of connective tissue clothed with columnar and sometimes * exfoliated epithelium. ■ i, ^though uterine cancer is commonly primary, secondaiy nodules, : both ot sarcoma and carcinoma, may spring up in the uterus, the j primary tumour being in other and remote parts of the body. In t these cases the nodules are usually imbedded in the fundus or ; project from its peritoneal surface. We have seen also an instance ot well-marked colloid cancer invading the fundus of the uterus .from an adjacent wide-spread colloid of the peritoneum.

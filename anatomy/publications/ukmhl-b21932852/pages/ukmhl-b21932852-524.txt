508 CHRONIC PHTHISIS (MIXED AND TUBERCULAR). tion. The excavation is commonly surrounded by crude ar.d miliary tubercles which gradually soften, are then discharged into the main cavity, giving rise to the anfractuosities 'which we com- monly observe. The excavations are often traversed by bands of pulmonary tissue infiltrated with tubercular matter, and compared by Laennec to the columnee carneie of the heart. These bands often contain branches of the pulmonary artery, the walls of which are always thickened and infiltrated with tubercular products, and the channels of which are usually obliterated. Less frequently the vessels remain pervious and become enlarged into aneurismal dilatations, from which fatal haemorrhage sometimes occurs. The bronchioles, and successively the larger air-tubes, are subjected to Fig. 115. A lonK, exhibiting extensive intimate and lower lobe, and the tube, cular disease is seen encroaching upon the latter. the same destructive agency, until the power of resistance caused bv the stronger walls of the bronchi of the first and second order is too great to bo overcome by the morbid process. Instead of a mere uneven rugged surface, as if the lung baa been mouse-eaten, the walls of old cavities often present a uniform velvety appearance, and are invested by a false membrane. which may assume a considerable thickness, but at the eai 1 disease is of slight consistence and easily separable.

Bony Plates in the Arachnoid.— Growths of this kind are of fre- quent occurrence on the visceral side of the membrane. In this respect we perceive a characteristic distinction between the head and the spinal column, for, while in the former, ossific deposits are common in the dura mater, and are scarcely ever met with in the ' other membranes, in the spinal column they are found to prevail in the arachnoid, and not to atfect the dura mater. A remarkable instance is recorded by Herbert Mayo, in his “ Outlines of Human • Pathology,” of osseous concretions surrounding the posterior roots of the nerves, and proceeding to the lower extremity. This un- ! doubtedly belonged to the class of pathological products under 1 consideration; and the case has a special interest, from its bearing upon an important law of nervous conduction. The pains suffered 4 by the patient were so limited to the lower extremity, and were so excruciating, that the surgeon performed amputation of the limb t though with what results need scarcely be stated. Cartilage also forms, though less frequently on the arachnoid. A good instance is recorded in the Eeports of the Pathological ■Society of London, by Dr. Quain,* who describes the lamime as composed of a transparent matrix, in which were deposited • small cells, containing nucleoli, and numerous small amorphous i granules. Tubercle of the Spinal Meninges.—The spinal pia mater appears to be by no means so liable to be the seat of the tubercular growth ■ as is that of the cerebrum. . Eokitansky remarks on the subiect, that he has never had occasion to suspect the exudation formed on the pi a mater to be of a tuberculous nature. An acute tuberculosis, he adds, he has never observed in it. » “ Reports," &c., 1S49, p. 26.

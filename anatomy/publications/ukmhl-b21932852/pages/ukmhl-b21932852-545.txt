The occurrence of pneumothorax is only possible when the pleura at The point of perforation has not previously become adherent; but :it sometimes happens that the ulcerative process is continued after ,:he pulmonary and parietal pleura have been agglutinated, and • passing through the uniting medium attacks the intercostal -tebbshed mteeument8, A fistul°ns opening may thus be HYDROTHORAX. Hydro thorax, or dropsical accumulation of fluid in the pleural ac, occurs in two forms, as a primary and as a consecutive lesion • he former is a disease of much less frequent occurrence than was •t one time supposed. Laennec states that one could not establish ^higher ratio for the occurrence of idiopathic hydrothorax as a ause of death, than one m two thousand. Let us hope that the ays are past in which such errors of diagnosis as he alludes to an be committed; for he asserts having found hypertrophy of the eart aortic aneurism, phthisis pulmonalis of a somewhat irreeu- r»r character, and even scm-hus of the stomach or liver, without ie least effusion into the pleura, mistaken for hydrothorax. The nection consists m the effusion of a limpid serosity into the leura, to a greater or less amount, generally limited to one side, ad unaccompanied by any appreciable change of structure in the ; ous membrane; the compression exerted by the fluid upon the and the adjacent parts is necessarily the same in this instance t spidered f0rmS °f U1(1 accumnlation V’hich have already been The secondary or symptomatic form of hydrothorax is a common .d i,\nVCUte-f chronjc diseases, heralding the fatal termination, " y.m" evidence of that loss of tonicity that results from tTto L"? .?'t0 •ft™ “ frequently vul.r ill IT allt tb“n aQy other; hypertrophy of the heart, sociafLi^l’ ^ncmxhhH, are common causes ; it is also often ?ection« ^nth r<3nal degenerations, tubercular and cancerous DS'- T“° •Same cause induces the effusion into the ’ glv?8 ,Tlse t° dropsical accumulation in other serous Rf-nr.’/n'm tllG ce u!ar tissue ; hence symptomatic bydrothorax ,g;n fm! 7 aCCOmffani°d by other affections of the same kind rf-ice b!

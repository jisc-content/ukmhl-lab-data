CYSTIC DISEASE OF THE OVARIES. 773 fluous to recall the fact that the Graafian follicle is itself a cyst, lined by a cylindrical epithelium, called the Membrana Granulosa, which is accumulated at one point into a granular mass (discus proligerus), containing the ovum. The follicle further contains a transparent albuminous fluid, called the liquor folliculi, the increase of which constitutes cystic enlargement. Waldeyer * believes this liquid to be continually added to by the disintegra- tion of the follicular epithelium. It is worth noting, that the size of the mature follicle is ten to twelve millimetres = three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Simple cysts of this kind are met with in the foetal ovary, and subsequently at all ages. As the dilatation increases the ovum perishes, but has been still demonstrated in cysts, the size of a bean or of a cherry, by Eokitansky and Eitchie. Several cysts are often found in the same ovary, but naturally the largest are those which occur singly. The larger cysts are liued by a simple pavement-epithelium. Their con- tents are either clear albuminous fluid, or the same variously coloured by the admixture of blood. The walls are, of course, much thicker than those of a normal follicle. Simple cysts are usually small, and rarely larger than a henâ€™s egg; but instances as large as the fist, or still larger, are described. They often occur in both ovaries at once. The cause of their production is unknown, but they may occur quite independently of menstruation. Fig. 181. Incipient cyst formation. The ovary is represented of the normal size. Another variety of simple cyst is that proceeding from a trans- formation of the corpus luteum, as first traced by Eokitansky. In such a case the wall of the cyst is lined by a layer of soft material, thicker than itself, and somewhat loosely attached, in

THE NERVES. 310 posterior nerves were entirely atrophied and converted into trans- parent threads, which contrasted strongly with the normal appeal - ance of the anterior nerves. Special cranial nerves become atrophied when the part of the brain from which they spring is destroyed by new growth or haemorrhage ; and anything which cu_- off communication with the nerve centres has the same effect. In some of these cases, as well as in others which appe^ idiopatlnc, the atrophy appears to be preceded by an overgrowth of the con nective tissue matrix of the nerve, producing a condition hke the erev degeneration of the central nervous organs before described. Thus Rokitansky* states, that under certain circumstances, nerves which are extremely atrophied acquire a greyish translucent ap- nearance eSpecianyywithin the skull, and that the colouring is produced by the presence of a blastema filled with numerous nuclei which, at first gelatinous, and afterwards tough and elastic, takes the place of the nerve tubes as thev (hsappe^j^t be^m^ more distinctly visible, as the original neurilemma of themtlectea nerve diminishes. He adds, that the vessels of a nerve in this condition are often palpably dilated (4) Atrophy may also the consequence of inflammation or (o) of semte decay. hZStZiv of Nerves.-This condition is extremely rare, and its origin is qifite unexplained.

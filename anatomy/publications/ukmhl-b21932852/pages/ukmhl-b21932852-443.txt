THE PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF RESPIRATION. CHAPTER NXIN. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Me shall examine the pathological conditions of the different parts of the respiratory system in the order in which they naturally present themselves, as we proceed from the orifice downwards: commencing whh the larynx and its appendix the epiglottis, we shall descend to the trachea, the bronchi and their ramifications, the pulmonary parenchyma and the pleura. Though a definite relation exists between these different parts, which is more intimate in some than m others, they are each susceptible of isolated morbid 3tates; and though the continuity of the mucous membrane lining Oie entire passages frequently induces a propagation of disease trom one part to the other, this is by no means universally the case, i and the catarrh or croup affecting the larynx or trachea need not -'ause any pathological changes in the adjacent mucous membrane, ar the other tissues of the affected part itself. The absolute imnort- mce of the morbid condition to the individual does not necessarily oear a direct relation to its intensity, but depends a great deal P?n affected; a point which the physiological iaws regu- ;• the different sections of the respiratory organs render sifffi- -lenuy palpable ; thus a trifling amount of inflammatory swelling “ tb0 §lottls or epiglottis threatens danger, while much nwe in- ense inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma, or of the bronchi nay run its course without causing more than a temporary incon- ST- P* feature» 0,‘h« V** condition ma/be lnS •Shmilarlr bearmgS Up0n th° exlstence of the individual are widely inflammation of mucous surfaces in general.

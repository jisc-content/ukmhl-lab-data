CHAPTER XXni. THE BLOOH VESSELS. The arteries and veins are not by any means subject to precisely the same morbid conditions; the difference in the directionof the current in the composition of the blood, in the velocity and force of the circulation, and in the structure of them coats, are must not be overlooked in forming an estimate of the dtoeasto o these two great classes of vessels. The of disease m its primary and secondary form are essentially drffeient in the two, as wofind their physiological and anatomical relations to be videlv Tnart The arteries e°xhibit between then lining membrane and Sir coat a dense fibrous layer, which contains no therefore removes the vasa vasorum, which ramify in the cellular coat much further from the lining membrane than is the case m the veins, nor can any vessels be detected on the lining coat, or on the disesses of thes. two classes of vessels respectively will be seen as we go on. the arteries.

The increase of the Wt, bo* in weight and size, with advanced age. is apparently a true byp tronhv and is probably connected with the progressive rigidity of thl arteries, which is a part of senile decay, and which mu t increase the arterial resistance. Also, up to a certain point, the wPiVht of the bodv and with this the mass of blood, increases. that from both these causes the heart is called upon for more w- all the dimensions of the heart, from mfarmj ^ jg a fi,U- point between the base and apex, andL near bet^wn ^‘fh^b^a^apex, and is n-iven here.)

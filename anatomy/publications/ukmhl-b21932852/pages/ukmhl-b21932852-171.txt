CYSTOID TUMOURS. 155 The new growths are seldom distinct, but so intimately connected with the substance of the organ as rather to resemble an infiltration They have much resemblance to the deposits of white blood cells met with in cases of leucocythmmia, but in the disease in question an increase m the number of white cells in the blood is not ob- served. Sometimes the newly-formed growth resembles the morbid form of cytogenous tissue previously described (Fig. 25), but some- times the cells very greatly predominate. Lymphoma and Lymphosarcomaâ€”Distinct tumours, composed of cytogenous tissue, unconnected with any general condition of that tissue throughout the body, are not Very common. The most notable growths of this kind are seen in the mediastinum Here they may arise from the lymphatic glands, or possibly from the remnant of the thymus gland. They sometimes remain isolated sometimes infiltrate neighbouring organs. When a lymphatic tumour has the structure of a normal lymphatic gland, it is called a lymphoma, men the proportion of cells is very large, Virchow lias applied the name lymphosarcoma, as making an approach to sarcomatous tumours. Many such tumours were formerly described as medullary cancer.

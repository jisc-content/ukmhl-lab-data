580 INFLAMMATION OF THE INTESTINE. structure of these parts, which throw light on their pathological changes. The solitary glands of the intestine, which occur both in small and large, as well as their aggregations constituting the patches of Peyer, which do not extend"beyond the ileo-caecal valve, are quite destitute of the follicular character, that is, agree only in name with those glands which are involutions of the general mucous surface, invested by a lining of epithelium. They are Fig. 134. Vertical section of Peyerian patch, and solitary gland of large intestine. The glands in both are rather enlarged. A. Peyerian patch from ileum. b, Solitary gland. simply solid aggregated masses of nuclear particles and lymphatic corpuscles, imbedded in a nucleated stroma, with very little inter- vening granulous matter, and lying completely beneath the sheet of basement membrane that covers the surface. They are not contained in a distinct capsule of homogeneous membrane, but lie partly in the corium of the mucous tissue, partly m that layer of nuclei and granulous matter which is spread under the basement membrane, and forms the chief substance of the villi, to which we <raye some years ago the name of â€œ substratum. It is apparent from this structural arrangement that they cannot be secreting oi-o-ans like the Lieberkuehn tubes all round them, for they have no outlet. On the other hand, they are from then- very structure peculiarly liable to become enlarged and prominent, the nuclei attracting to themselves plasma, and developing mto cells, so tka the actual number of lymph corpuscles is very greatly mcreasei. There seems no doubt that they are much more developed m some persons than in others, and we are inclined to think that masses of precisely similar appearance may be formed mucous membrane solely as the result of irritation. _ e been led to this belief from having found only a few distant and

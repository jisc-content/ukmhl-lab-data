BED SOFTENING. 265 hemispheres, and, on section, drops of blood may ooze out from the divided surface; there is no necessary change in the consistency of the spot, though it is frequently somewhat softer than the healthy tissue ; as the disease advances the exudation of lymph and sup- puration ensue, and the colour and consistency of the affected part are modified in proportion. These products are much more frequently the result of chronic and of secondary, than of acute and primary encephalitis. So much so, in fact, that softening, which is the most common effect of inflammatory action, has been treated by many authors as an idiopathic disease. RED SOFTENING. The condition known as red softening has been a matter of con- • siderable dispute among pathologists, some regarding it as a form of inflammation, others as an infarction due to obstructed circula- t tion. The former view has been till lately that generally accepted. Fui. G". ■Vessels from the brain of a female aged forty, who died hemiplegic, in consequence of red softening of the right hemisphere. We find in this condition marked congestion, giving to the affected Part a reddish hue; and in the softened tissues the microscope show besides broken-down nerve matter, a large number of glomeruli, or granule-cells. The vessels are also often found formlv8Ud^U-R< f ih7vCOllf^°nB fa«y. granules, either uni- Sk 6y> or else in isolated masses. This ondition must be distinguished from fatty degeneration of the walls of the vessels. The absence of pus-cells would not be an absolute

EXTEA-UTERINE PREGNANCY. 804 The foregoing remarks also apply, in the main, to abdominal gestation; here the ovum, probably owing to a want of that erectile tone in the fimbriated extremity of the tube by which, in ordinary pregnancy, it is made to embrace the ovary when concepttion is effected, falls into the peritoneal cavity. The development pro- ceeds up to a certain point, the foetus becomes enclosed in very thick and firm membranes, and death ensues from peritonitis, or haemorrhage, or else the foetus is eliminated in the manner above described. Pregnancy in the parietes of the uterus probably consists in an arrest of the ovum at the point at which the tube is inserted into the uterus; the sac, therefore, consists chiefly of the muscular tissue of the uterus, but owing to the irregular development of the organ, the process cannot run its full course to the full period, the walls of the sac in which the ovum lies give way, and haemorrhage or peritonitis results. Ovarian pregnancy results from the impregnation of the ovum in the Graafian follicle, where for any reason it is not detached, although the follicle is ruptured. It seems to be an actual occur- rence, though extremely rare, and though some authorities have denied the possibility of it.

In an injected specimen (Fig. 45, p. 194), 'it may be seen that these become obliterated on reaching the tubercle. Conditions of Lung in which Miliary Tubercle occurs.—This form of tubercle may occur generally scattered through tho lung or con- hned to one spot. When it is generally distributed, wo may con- clude that all the tubercles were formed at once, or during a short space of time, as the consequence of an acute affection, and tuber- cles of the same age are generally found either on the pleura or in some other organs, as the pia mater, kidneys, peritoneum, &c.—that | is to say, there is acute general tuberculosis. In such cases (as was

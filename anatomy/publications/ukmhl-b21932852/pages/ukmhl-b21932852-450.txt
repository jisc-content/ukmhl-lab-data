These vary in size from an almost imperceptible point to a pin’s head, and even to that of a bean;* and closely resemble miliary granulations, surrounded by a halo of blood-vessels, as they appear for in- stance in the pia mater. The microscope, however, reveals their structure; showing the basement membrane of the follicle lined with epithelium, and containing oily mat- ter. The cheesy particles coughed up by many people, are formed partly in the follicular struc- tures of the tonsils; and probably also in the follicles of which we have jus, spoken. The epiglottis is liable to suffer from syphilitic ulceration, by- an es-ten- sion of the disease from the fauces: it very rarely pa^es beyon to the larvnx and trachea. In small-pox and other eruptive fevem, the peculiar poison of the disease often sets up its action in -he respiratory passages: the former may uustules on the glottis, accompanied by a more or less re and serou^1 infiltration ; in the latter ulcerative destruction and cedematous swelling occur. the larynx.

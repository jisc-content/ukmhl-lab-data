DEGENERATIONS. 12G coats of arteries which have begun to be affected by atheroma, and in the valves of the heart under similar circumstances. The athe- romatous condition, which we shall describe more when we speak of the diseases of arteries, may either terminate inSoftening and breaking down of the arterial coats, or m calcareous deposition; both of these changes often co-exist, but the latter predominates in old age. We think, however, t rat deposition Pof earthy matter may take place to a great exte^t- so^as to produce the ossification so common m the vessels of the ao-ed without previous atheromatous or fatty degeneration, ihe auantity of earthy matter in the bones becomes greatly increased in later life it is even deposited in the so-named permanent cartdages and it is, therefore, not surprising that it should also affect the walls of the vessels. This degeneration, probably, is occasioned solely by a failure of assimilative nutritive power in . thOtheTfmms'of degeneration have been described by authors; as the LS which affects the cells of certain tumours, causing them to lose their distinctness; becoming first individually con- verted into masses of transparent gelatinous material, and next fused together so as to lose wholly or partly their separate outhnes. The material called colloid is related to the albuminates, and re- sembTetScm, but differs in not being precipitated by acetic acid. Colloid metamorphosis, or degeneration, occurs in normal strm tures as the thyroid, and in new growths, as in colloid cancer. Mucoid degeneration, better called simply metamorphosis con- sists in the transformation of albuminous constituents of tissues into mucin, a substance distinguished from albumenEvedTy an nf beino- coagulated by acetic acid, and not ie-dissolyea oy excess ° This” substance is often found m embryomc tissues and cells the membranesoftheW, The pathological pigmentation is es &c °-^ls js tnie o"pSntotion such as that in AdcJ^

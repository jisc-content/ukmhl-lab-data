The morbid process just described which includes fibroid indura- tion and the formation of cavities, is evidently closely allied to ordinary phthisis, and has been J often called fibroid phthisis. It differs, however, from tubercular or broncho-pneumonic phthisis in two respects at least. First, in the absence of tubercles and of caseous masses ; secondly, in i usually affecting one lung only, or even one lobe ; while phthisis, 1 properly so called, can only be confined to one lung in its earlier • stages. Some specimens of fibroid and indurated lung, with cavities much like what have just been described, are found on examina- tion to contain tubercles. ,Dr. Williams describes a chro- nic form of pneumonia, in which i the hepatized portion, owing to i the thickening of individual vesi- cles, assumes an oolitic aspect. - He is of opinion that consumption may originate in this species of pneumonia without the pre-exist- ence of any distinct tuberculous bdisease. It is not impossible that . Fibroid or adenoid tissue from an indurated lung-, showing abundant 111 oid corPusclGs and fibrous inter- cellular substance.

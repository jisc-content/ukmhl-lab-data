CHAPTER XXYIII. the lymphatic system. We have here to consider the morbid conditions of the lymphatic • vessels and lymphatic glands. x,—the lymphatic vessels. Inflammation.—Acute inflammation of a lymphatic is manifested. by redness, painfulness, and swelling in its course; the coats be- come thickened and infiltrated, the cavity dilated, and exudation and suppuration may occur in their channels. A resolution is the most common termination of the process. The presence of actual pus in the lymphatics does not usually arise from inflammation of the vessels ; but this may be introduced into theni by abrasion or ulceration of lymphatics communicating with an abscess. .Tun- form matter is, however, frequently found which like the softened thrombi in veins, consists of fibrin which has undergone a peculiar molecular disintegration. Suppurative inflammation gives rise to small isolated abscesses along the course of the lymphatic vessek. forming, as it were, stations of the disease, each of which appears to serve as a fresh focus of morbid action. The inflammatory process affects, more or less, the surrounding cellular tissue from the commencement. As the inflammation advances the lymph- atics become blended with it, and suppuration and J “ of abscess involve the entire mass.

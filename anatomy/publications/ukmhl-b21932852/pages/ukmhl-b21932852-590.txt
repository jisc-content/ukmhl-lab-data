Changes in surrounding parts.-The mucous membrane covering the cancerous growth may undergo various changes. It sim .- times degenerates into an areolar cancerous tissue, which x.-- chartres large quantities of gelatinous mucous fluid , or it is converted into erectile tissue as a fungoid growth, which becomes the seat of encephaloid infiltration, suppurates, and partially exposes the submucous scirrhous cellular tissue, or, lastly, it most frequently becomes the seat of a sloe-black softening, with hemorrhage,” or it is quite destroyed, and the sloughing proem, aEks even the denuded scirrhus itself.

Clapton : “Trans. Path. Soc.," 1871, vol. xxii. p. 20, Plate ii. ATRornY. 274 In idiots we have congenital atrophy of the entire or of portions of the brain; in the twain of old insane persons it is common, according to Neumann’s statement, who has examined fifty cases of the kind, to find the posterior lobes and their convolutions more atrophied than other parts; Sir Charles Bell, Cruveilhier, and Lallemand record cases of epilepsy and hemiplegia, accompany- ing congenital atrophy of one hemisphere, though not necessarily associated with a destruction of the intellectual powers. Atrophy of the brain is often seen at the autopsies of persons who have died of starvation or in an extremely cachectic state; and being necessarily accompanied by a large increase of fluid within, this fact has led to such cases being described as cases of serous apoplexy,” a condition not proved to exist, and which can noser he admitted as a cause of death. Atrophy of particular parts, e,g., of the cerebellum has been known to occur.* In one remarkable case, recorded by Dr. ^lap- ton this portion of the brain was reduced to one-third its natuiai size, weighing 710 grains, instead of 2,200, which was reckoned as the mean weight. No cause could be traced.

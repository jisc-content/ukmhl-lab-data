PARASITES IN BONE. SGI bone. Frequent attempts to destroy the cyst and its contents, by escharotics, after removal of a portion of the external osseous sheath, failed; and the constant sproutina: out of fresh hydatids at last induced Mr. Keate to saw off the entire tumour, after which the girl completely recovered. The diameters of the exposed surface were 44 by 4 inches. In the very compact and hard bony substance, forming the base of the tumour, were five or six cells, containing hydatid cysts. It appears that from these , cells the hydatids were constantly regenerated, forcing their way into the large cavity of the tumour, and yielding to no treatment, as the remedies failed to destroy the matrix lforn which they pullulated. Mr. Stanley quotes some cases from his own experience, and that of other observers, from which it appears that the bones of the skeleton are all equally liable to be attacked. The develop- ment of hydatids induces a gradual, painless expansion of the bone, which may thus become perforated, and allow of an escape of the hydatids. The cavity of bone in which the hydatids form is lined by an adventitious cyst, and this is said to be liable to excite inflammation in the surrounding bone, as well as to induce purulent products in the cysts. Cysts of this description often contain matter, to the naked eye, absolutely identical with laudable pus, which, however, under the microscope, exhibits none of the characters of pus. Cysticercus cellulosae was observed in one case by Froriep in the first phalanx of the middle finger, where it had developed in the midst of the bone, and by secondary inflammation destroyed the external wall on the volar side.

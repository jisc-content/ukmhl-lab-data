Laennec has very correctly compared the appearance thus presented to that we see on quickly separating two slabs of marble, between which a layer of butter was interposed. This plastic Fig. 79. A heart covered with inflammatory lymph, investing both the parietal and visceral layer of the pericardium, which has been cut open and reverted. An incision has been made through the false membrane over the left ventricle, to turn it back and show the subjacent muscular tissue. The lymph fringes the right auricle and coats the root of the aorta. material gradually becomes organized, and we find minute red vessels projecting into it: and as this process proceeds the two surfaces become intimately adherent to one another; the lymph loses its fluid constituents; it is converted into firm bands, con- necting more or less loosely the visceral and parietal pericardium, which, according to their density and tenacity, indicate the period of their formation. If adhesion does not result, absorption may remove these appearances, and nothing but a general opacity or thickening of the pericardium remains; or again, the active con- dition may be arrested after the formation of villi, and without the supervention of adhesion they may continue in a passive state, and present the appearance termed the hairy heart, the cor â– nllosum. It is customary to quote as an instance of this a classical name; the great enemy of Sparta. Aristomenes, was captured and killed on his third entry into Lacedaemon, and his heart is stated by Pausanias to have been found covered with hair tn other cases the effusion resulting from pericarditis will bo of a

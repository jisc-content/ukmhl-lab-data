834 NECROSIS. Necrosis may be superficial or central, total or partial. The necrotic portion is not at first separated from the healthy or less altered hone ; but a process is set up which ends in its com- plete demarcation, like the inflammation which cuts off a gangrenous external part of the body. In the process of separation the following changes occur :â€”All round the necrosed portion, that is to say, at its margins and at the part where its surface is exposed to that of the healthy bone, the latter undergoes a gradual expansion, or rarefaction of its tissue, by the enlargement of its Haversian canals r assumes a rosy colour, and becomes succulent. It gradually acquires an areolar Era. 190. Necrosis of the head of the femur, acetabulum and shaft, subsequent to amputation. A. Necrosed acetabulum and head; completely ankylosed and broken off at e from the neck. /. Remains of the articular surfaces closely united, b. Neck and upper part of the shaft, a. New bone. b. New bone undergoing necrosis, c. Bone still con- taining blood-vessels, and in various stages of inflammation, d. A membranous septum, marking the boundary of the dead and living bone. structure, and is thus more rarefied; at length it disappears alto- gether, and a red, soft, spongy substance, a layer of granulations, occupies its place. This change is, in fact, inflammation of bone, which gives,rise to suppuration and granulation. The bony tissue, beginning with the Haversian canals, is dissolved by the matter secreted within them, while the granulations which continue to grow fill up the spaces thus left. The immediate result of this process is the formation of a furrow of demarcation, which encircles the margin of the dead bone, and is filled up with granulations and pus, till at length the sequestrum is separated from the surround- ing bone by a suppurating groove, which always communicates

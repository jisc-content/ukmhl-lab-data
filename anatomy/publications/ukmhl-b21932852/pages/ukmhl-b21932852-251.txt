235 HAEMORRHAGE INTO THE ARACHNOID. being; the form of cerebral sanguineous effusion most common in childhood; the reverse condition obtains in adult life, when h;e- morrhage within the cerebral tissue is the prevailing form. We have already alluded to one' variety of haemorrhage occurring in the tissues of the head in the new-born infant, which we stated to be the result of the mechanical pressure exerted during parturi- tion ; the same cause may give rise to arachnoidal effusion, which then commonly and speedily proves fatal. In this case we find a larger or smaller quantity of fluid blood investing the upper surface of the brain; but, if the child survives the immediate shock of the Fig. 56. « Z?113 represents a portion of the dura mater divided from above, and showing* w*u^“.was filled with coagulated blood.

The first step is the formation of a coagulum; the fluid portions are absorbed, then, by degrees, the colouring matter passes through various changes till it also disappears, and we find, in the place of the original coagu- lum, a membranous formation, which is more or less organized and may be shown to contain a capillary system of its own. It ^ a singular fact in the pathology of the disease, to which MAI Billiot and Barthez were the first to draw attention, that, unlike cerebra1 hemorrhage in the adult, it rarely gives rise to paralysis in the child, a circumstance explained by Dr. West,* upon the M*D.<LLondon Diseasos of InfuI‘cy and Childhood,” p. 40.

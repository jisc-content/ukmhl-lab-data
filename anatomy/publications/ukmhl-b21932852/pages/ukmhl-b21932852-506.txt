490 CHRONIC PNEUMONIA. condition is represented in Pig. 108. The ■walls are seen greatly thickened, and containing pigment granules, while the air cells are filled with large irregular masses resembling mucus corpuscles, but often of abnormal size, as if several were fused together, and also containing pigment. It is not easy to say whether these bodies are produced where they are found, or have entered the air cells from the bronchial tubes. Era. 108. Section of an indurated lung affected with chronic pneumonia, showing the walls of the alveoli very greatly thickened, and the cavities filled with mucous corpuscles and larger masses containing pigment. We do not, however, always find that chronic pneumonia con- sists in changes of this kind. It may, on the other hand, resemble acute lobar pneumonia in having the air cells filled with fibrinous exudation, and the only peculiarity observable in the exudation is the preponderance of tough, opaque granular fibrin and the small number of cells. In other cases we have found a remarkably luxuriant development of epithelial structures, which have quite filled the alveoli. Induration and contraction, however, m the end depend on the formation of a fibroid (now called lymphadenoid tissue) and gradual obliteration or replacement of the pulmonary tissue by it. This tissue is represented in Pig. 109. It varies m different cases in the proportions of the lymphoid cells and inter- cellular substance, but no doubt, with time, the former waste and the latter increases. Precisely the same structure is found in many parts of a phthisical lung. . . ,, „ ,. „ Another result of chronic pneumonia is the formation ot cavities beside and beyond the bronchial dilatations already spoken ot. They are often lined by a very smooth membrane, but this is formed in course of time, and is only a sign that the cavity - existed a long time. Perforation of the pleura, empyema may result. Chronic pneumonia may, on the other

OECHITIS. 72(5 fibroid network. These degenerative changes commence in the central portions of the nodules, the resulting tough yellow masses being surrounded by a vascular zone of actively proliferating Flo. 173. x 320 Syphilitic Orchitis. (From a drawing by Sir. Arnott.) Fig. 174. tissues. As the affection subsides, this vascular zone, by an increase of its fibroid over its corpuscular elements, forms a tough capsule to the now cheesy encysted mass. Meanwhile, however, the changes in the connective tissue, by pressing upon the tubules of the testicle, cause a thickening of their coats and a fatty degeneration of their lining epithelium, so that in advanced cases of the disease the secreting power is gravely impaired, and the physiological activity of the organ diminished, or wholly destroyed. In- deed in some instances, after all active inflammatory changes have subsided, the testicle gradually dwindles away to a hard fibroid mass, not larger than a hazel nut, and of course destitute of functional power. This form of diseased testicle is apt to be associated with hydrocele. Scrofulous orchitis, although here also similar changes in the connective tissue and the tunics are met with, presents some striking contrasts to the syphilitic form of the disease. The epididymis is now the main seat of the destructive process, although the body of the testicle is frequently involved. The enlargement—often nodular at the Chronic orchitis, with fungous protrusion of testis. (From Mr. Curling’s article.)

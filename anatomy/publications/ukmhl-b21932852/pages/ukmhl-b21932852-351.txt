335 NORMAL DIMENSIONS OF THE HEART. average weight of the heart in males, from 25 to 55 years of age, as 11 oz. 1 dr., and in females as 9 oz. 2. The weight of the healthy heart is greater in persons who die after short periods of illness, and less in those who have sutfered from emaciating or exhausting diseases. Taking this difference into account, the inference is, that in adult males, who have died from acute diseases, or from the effects of accidents, the ordinary weight of the heart is from 9 to 11 oz. avoirdupois, and in those who have died from chronic diseases from 8 to 10 oz. In females the ordinary weight of the heart, in acute cases, may be regarded as from 8 to 10 oz., and in chronic diseases from 7 to 9 oz. Occasionally the weight may fall as low as 5 or 6 oz., in persons of small frame, dying of exhausting diseases; and in powerful men, dying suddenly, or after a short illness, may reach 12 oz., or perhaps even more, without exceeding the limit of health. _ 3. The heart usually increases in weight with the advance in life. This is shown in the following table :— Age. Males. Females. Nos. Weighed. Mean Weight. Nos. 'Weighed. Mean Weight. 15 to 20 20 to 23 30 to 40 40 to 60 50 to 60 60 to 70 9 27 31 9 15 3 oz. dr. 8 2§ 9 0A 9 7g? 9 Hi 9 12 10 13J 9 21 19 5 6 oz. dr. 8 lg 8 1"* 8 13fg 9 3 9 7J It is not, however, very clear to what period of life this increase extends, and whether in very advanced age there is not, as is shown to be the case with the brain, a more or less marked decbne in weight. These results agree with those obtained by Bizot, for the dimensions of the heart. NORMAL DIMENSIONS OF THE nEART.

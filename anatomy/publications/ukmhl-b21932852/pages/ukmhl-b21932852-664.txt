BILIAHY CALCULI. G48 Cholesterine is certainly secreted often in large quantity by tne thickened coats of the gall-bladder, and by additions from this source the large solitary calculi are probably formed ; there is no doubt, however, that in other cases it is deposited from the bile, owing to the decomposition of the taurocholic acid or its salts, by which it is naturally held in solution. Calculi are often loose and free in the cavity of the gall-bladder ; sometimes they are attached to its surface by exudation, or included m compartments formed bv organized lymph. Small ones are sometimes, also, contained in saccular dilatations of the mucous membrane^ and may appear to lie external to the cavity of the gall-bladder. The following effects are produced by bibary calculi. They become impacted in the cystic duct, and occasion its obliteration, the gall-bladder under- o-oino- the changes that have been described. The same thing Sccufs, but much more rarely, in the common duct, which m straighter and wider; great distension of the gall-bladder and ducts, and occasionally rupture of the former, then take place. If on account of the angular shape of the stone the duct is only partially obstructed, the same effects are produced but in a less degree. While lodged in the gall-bladder calculi may excite irritation, thickening, inflammation, and suppuration of its coats, and sometimes ulceration. Of these we have lately spoken. Acephalo-cysts, and the distoma hepaticum, occur mrthe gall- bladder. For a description of them, see article Parasites, p. -14.

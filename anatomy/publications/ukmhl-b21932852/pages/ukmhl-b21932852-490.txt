474 PULMONARY HAEMORRHAGE. rhagic infarction. Practically the condition is hardly met with, except in cases of heart disease, where the pulmonary circulation is impeded. Formerly haemorrhage was explained as a simple consequence of excessive pressure; but this does not account for the occurrence of isolated blocks, for their peculiar shape, or for the obstruction of the vessels. Heart disease then appears to act chiefly as a cause predisposing to coagulation of blood in the vessels. Also (if the explanation we have given be correct), by increasing the tension in the pulmonary veins. Changes in Ecemorrhayic Blochs.—A block of pulmonary apoplexy once formed, soon begins to undergo a process of evolution. The central parts become paler, and ultimately white, while at the same time they are drier and more friable. Next softening sets in, and the mass may liquefy into something very like pus in external appearance. No inerease in the number of leucocytes or lymphatic cells is, however, observed, the whitish mass, whether solid or liquefied, showing under the microscope chiefly obscure granular matter and fat, with only scattered corpuscles. These changes are not due to the re-establishment of circulation or to inflammation, but to a sort of necrosis, or “ necrobiotic decay,” as in tubercle. In the outer parts of the block, multiplication of elements and inflammation take place, resulting in the formation of fibrous tissue. Thus a zone of extremely hypersemic substance will be found surrounding the softened and decoloured central parts. At the same time there is always some inflammation of the pleura, usually with formation of false membranes of lymph. Finally, all the central part may be absorbed, and all that remains of the block will be a cicatrix of fibrous tissue, producing a depres- sion on the surface of the lung.

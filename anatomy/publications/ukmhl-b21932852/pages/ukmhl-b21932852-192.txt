CANCERS OR CARCINOMATOUS TUMOURS. 17(5 Fine section of scirrhus of the pleura, from which the cells have been washed out to show the alveolar stroma, composed of bands varying m thickness. To the left of the figure may be seen the development of alveoli. (From an original preparation.; Colloid cancer, the next variety we notice, is also called alveolar ; other cancers present more or less of an alveolar arrangement, but it never constitutes so prominent a feature of their structure. The walls of the alveoli consist of a fibroid tissue, sometimes extremely delicate and translucent,, sometimes, and especially in the deeper layers, strong and firm. The contained loculi vary in size from that of a grain of sand to that of a pea; they are round or oval; occasionally adjacent ones communicate together by solution of the interposed wall. The jelly-like substance in their cavities ib greenish-yellow, semi-transparent, and clammy; â€œit yields no gelatine on boiling, but seems to consist of a peculiar substance, identical with that naturally occurring in the cavities of the thy- roid, and in some cysts. Colls, nucleated and non-nucleated, cau- date and fusiform, nuclei, and elementary granules, occur in this growths, either similar to the original or encephaloid. Often it extends itself by infiltration among adjacent tissues. It rarely attains a large size, and is not often seen so large as an orange. Fig. 38.

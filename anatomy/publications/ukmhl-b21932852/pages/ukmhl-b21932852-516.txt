This change never occurs without inflammation; seldom without the presence of tubercles, and freouentlv attended by the production of fibroid tissue. 1 The controversies about pulmonary phthisis have of late years in «eat part turned upon the question whether there are several forms orwhether all are reducible to onethe question, as it is called’ of the unity or multiplicity of phthisis. According one school (which agrees with the doctrines of Laennec) dl changes in a phthisical lung are due to the deposiBon or prod^ Bnn and subsequent changes of one particular ^nd „oi ™ater1^ viz.

Again, of the non tubercular chlnges, two types are distinguished, namely, caseous ‘“wfbeKaK; varieties of phthisis; depend partly «]»» changes, or vice versa, but only parmy, anu l portant cause of the different appcarance s the mo e m Is n'sairsz arsrf C1 ° oto loa it iocs uot appear that the disc.™ h»

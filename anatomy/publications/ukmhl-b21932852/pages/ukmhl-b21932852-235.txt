The form called echinococcus multilocularis has been observed only in man, and nowhere except in the liver. It may reach a considerable size,’ forming a tumour as large as a child’s head, but contains no con- siderable cyst, being made up of an enormous number of minute cavities with gelatinous contents, so as greatly to resemble an alveolar colloid cancer, for which indeed the structure has been mistaken. It is particularly liable to central ulceration and softening. (Virchow.)

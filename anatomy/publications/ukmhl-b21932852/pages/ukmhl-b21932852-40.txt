CHANGES OF BLOOD CLOTS. 24 Fig. 1. fibrinous coagula which are found within the vascular system; and the variations may therefore depend upon the greater or less facility with which the white corpuscles leave the blood vessels. The correspondence, how- ever, between the fibrine in and out of the vessels is so close that the characters of the one apply also to the other; and we may therefore say that all the varieties of the fibrine of the blood, as manifested by the condition of the coagula, depend upon the predominance of one of two forms of struc- ture. In healthy fibrine the fibrous structure greatly predominates, the whole mass fibril- lates more or less perfectly, and the included corpuscles are comparatively few. This is Mr. Paget’s fibrinous variety. Unhealthy fibrine, which tends to disintegration, consists of a granular mass, imbedding very numerous nuclei and cell-formations ; this is the corpus- cular variety. These two correspond to Roki- tansky’s first and fourth varieties; and his second and third are only combinations of them in different proportions. ■ifm.SsSS Corpuscular unhealthy fibrine, from exudation on pericardium.

We shall here briefly notice the metamorphoses which blood- coagula may undergo :—(1.) A more or less perfect develojmient ol fibre may take place, in which the corpuscles are chiefly concerned. (2.) The coagula may fall to pieces, and undergo a kind ol disso- lution into a pappy or pus-like fluid, or in some cases into a fluid which is really of the nature of pus. This change may befall coagula of healthy fibrine, in consequence of their being placed m

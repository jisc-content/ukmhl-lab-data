CHAPTER XXII. CONGENITAL MALFORMATION OF THE HEART. Cardiac anomalies, dependent on congenital malformation, are mostly due to what is termed arrest of development; that is to »ay, the organ does not go through those changes by formed from its original simple structure into the ^mphcafc^ organization necessary for the performance of its func^- Hence such anomalies are characterized by greater simplicity, an excess of development is rarely met with m the heart, except as acquired condition. In all these varieties of congenital arrest, we observe a tendency to return to the primitive type of a single ina; cavity. As the growth proceeds through its different stages, from the simplest condition of the pulsating vessel, to the comPHs mechanism of the perfect heart, we see close resemblances be- tween temporary conditions of the human conditions of the heart in the lower animals. Thus_ the type oi the piscine heart is presented in those cases where in a onlvfind a single auricle and ventricle. There are, however, very many instance! of congenital malformation_ which _maj b«yreferred to disease (inflammation) occurrmg during mtra-uterme JLife. Classification of Malformations.— Such anomalies are ently classified, according to the period of^ fetal We at wtoh arrest of development takes place. Thus, according to Dr. t cacocn ^from whom we have borrowed much of the subsequent summary) slnting very slight indications of division, and the primitive arterial tri^ being retained ^ occurs at ♦ •< Malformations of the Heart,” tod edition, 1S66.

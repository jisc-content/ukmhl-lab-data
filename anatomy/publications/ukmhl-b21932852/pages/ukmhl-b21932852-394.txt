Calcification of the Middle Coat.— The process of calcificati m i often complicated by a similar affection of the middle coat, which is met with chiefly in the smaller or medium-sized arteries, where the muscular noddle coat predominates, and sraaetaies^ocuw alone. The calcareous matter is here deposited in the muscular bundles themselves, which become rigid, opaque, and jeUow. The change is however, partial, and the remaining part of the muscS coat shows hypertrophy. This change is obvious from outsit even to the naked eye, by the transverse and annular stripes’which correspond to the seat of calcification, plain y showhm that this is in the transverse fibres oi the middle coat The same thin" is well seen on malang a longitudinal section fr the vessel when the cut ends of the calcified muscular fibres Me seen6 in the midst of the fleshy middle coat, which is eu- dentlv abnormally thick.

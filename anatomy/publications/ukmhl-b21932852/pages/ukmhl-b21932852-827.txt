DISEASES OF THE JOINTS, 811 form and circular cells. These elements were contained in an enveloping membrane, very thin, of whitish aspect, and nearly homogeneous texture. There existed scarcely any trace of stromal Fig. 187. A a, Vertical section of cartilage in process of absorption towards the left, and over- lapped by the vascularized pulpy synovial fringe. The edge of the cartilage where it is obliquely truncated is continuous with the fibrous tissue on the left hand. B, Healthy cartilage cells from the right-hand side, more magnified. c, Greatly enlarged cartilage cell, containing young cells. d, Loculus, from thickened synovial membrane, filled and surrounded with nuclei fibres, hut a good many large vesicles, or loculi, formed of almost homogeneous walls, and filled with material similar to that which surrounded them. Delicate-walled blood-vessels ramified through the mass, but not in great numbers. It seems very probable that the altered synovial tissue promotes and is concerned in the absorp- tion of the cartilage. The disease almost always occurs before the middle period of life. â€œ In goneral it can be traced to no evident

To explain the apparent diminution after the age of seventy, we must remember that the total number of living is very much reduced, and that hence the relative number of apoplectic cases is probably even larger than at an earlier a°-e. Cases of apoplexy, even in children, are not unknown, and appear to depend upon disease of the vessels, which sometimes present the appearance represented in Pig. 65.* . The amount of haemorrhage varies from a spot of the size of a pm s head to an accumulation of many ounces ; the former, which may be termed capillary haemorrhage, is frequently observed in connection with effusions of a more extensive character, but may often be assumed to have occurred during life, where trifling apo- plectic symptoms have rapidly passed off under appropriate°treat- ment It is not generally easy to trace tbe vessels from which the blood has been effused, and there is also much obscurity as to the actual nature of the morbid action which induces the haemorrhage. All parts of the encephalon may present apoplectic effusions, but the parts most frequently affected are the anterior lobes, and espe- cially the vicinity of the corpora striata. As a rule the grey structures, including the convolutions of the brain, exhibit the greatest proclivity to the affection, which is in consonance with the known vascularity of these tissues. The structures most removed from the grey matter, as the corpus callosum and the tomix, are least liable to it. Apoplectic effusion is not veiy fre- quent in the cerebellum, but it is found to be more rapidly and invariably fatal when it occurs here than elsewhere. Andral’s extensive sphere of observation has only presented him with six eases of hemorrhage into the cerebellum, and in three of these it Was associated with haemorrhage into tho cerebrum.

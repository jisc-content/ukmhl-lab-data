THE PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. CHAPTER VIII. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. :Ix no organ or system of the human body is there such an apparent want of accordance and definite relation between the - symptoms of disease and the structural derangements and changes produced by it, as in the nervous system at large. This is due to various causes. In the first place, our physiological knowledge of the laws governing the action of the nervous system is not on a par with our acquaintance with the processes operating in other •organs; chemistry, physics, mechanics, can be called to aid in the investigation of the healthy and diseased states of the bones the solt tissues investing them, the thoracic or abdominal viscera; and tne structure of these parts is more analogous to what meets the eye ot the scientific observer in other departments of nature It is then manifestly impossible, if we are imperfectly acquainted with the laws governing the nervous system in health, that we should IB a Clently’ to dodne and appreciate the deviations from satiafii r ®ta“dard;,iand>. in “any instances, wo must be satisfied to refer for oxpknation of the symptoms we meet with ro hypothetical analogies, or confess our entire incapability of accounting for the phenomena before us. A correct appreciation f the symptoms of disease is a point which next may be fiiirlv demanded of us if wo attempt to explain or seek for moi bid pheno mena after death; thanks to Sir Charles Bell, Flourens, Marshall HaH, Romberg, and other distinguished inquirers of the present ge’ mu<h has been cleared up which previously 1 ‘■npeaetrable tnytay; but ouAo.ns o/plJSf “ Q

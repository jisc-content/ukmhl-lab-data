There is also often general thickening of all the coats, rigidity, atheroma, and calcareous degeneration of the arterial wall, with diminution of its calibre, as has been well figured by Dr. Lionel Beale. No particular change is observable in the before-mentioned capillaries, or in the veins, except that the latter often contain firm coagula of blood, which are more or less closely adherent to their walls, so as sometimes to constitute actual thrombosis.

Large Form of Interstitial Nephritis.—In some cases the anatomi- cal changes just described are met with in kidneys which are lar^e smooth, and pale, in which the cortex is enlarged, and the capsule easily removed, and which are, in short, not to be distinguished by the naked eye from kidneys affected with parenchymatous nephritis. These constitute, accordingly, a certain proportion of the “large, smooth kidneys” of Bright. The secreting structure is m such cases often little altered ; a fact which has led some waters to regard this as the necessary first stage of the contracted granular kidney. There is, however, no proof that all contracted Kidneys have passed through this stage, and we may again refer to the parallel of liver diseases; comparing this form of kidney to om?\rgeV Sm°oth form of cirrhosis (smooth interstitial Hepatitis P- Wd). In persons who die of kidney disease this form is cer- tamly rare. Y Y

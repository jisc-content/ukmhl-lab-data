231 ADVENTITIOUS GROWTHS OF THE DURA MATER. falx is occasionally found cribra.ted, and that in old people the dura mater presents slits in the vicinity of the longitudinal sinus, varying from two to four lines in length, through which the Pacchionian glands have forced their way. The records of the Pathological Society of London contain the account of a very rare defect of the falx cerebri, exhibited by Mr. Shaw.* Dr. Brightf also gives a similar case, in which no trace of the process was visible anterior to the tentorium, and it was assumed that the defect, which occurred in a lady thirty years of age, had existed from birth. * Reports of the Pathological Society, 1847-48, p. 178. 1 Medical Reports, vol. i. p. 150.

97 SUPPURATION. •is fluid, viz., pus, which, in the words of Eokitansky (loc. cit.), has been till now separated in an unnaturally sharp manner from other exudations. There are many varieties of pus; but that which is commonly ecalled healthy (laudable) is that which we shall take for a typical (description. It appears to the naked eye as a creamy, thick, ojpaque, and homogeneous fluid; communicates an unctuous feel- img when rubbed between the fingers; is of a yellow or whity- jyellow tint; sweetish or insipid; and, while warm, gives off a poeculiar, mawkish smell. Its specific gravity is 1*030-1'033. If nillo wed to stand some time in a tall, narrow glass, the fluid sepa- rates into a thickish sediment, more or less abundant, and a super- natant serum. This serum, according to Yogel (whose account we s-bhall use freely) is identical with the serum of the blood, contain- ing one to four per cent, of albumen, extractive and saline matters, mnd fat. It coagulates when treated. The reaction is alkaline ; iraut it readily becomes acid, from the generation of an acid, which lss commonly supposed to be the lactic. A peculiar substance, nailed pyin by Giiterbock, somewhat resembling mucin, was formerly thought characteristic of this pathological product, but -s not usually found in normal pus. It is an albuminoid sub- stance, containing a larger proportion of oxygen than the true Albuminates. Chemical Constitution of Pus.—The following analysis, by Dr. Wright, exhibits the main features of the chemical constitution of : ms very well. They apply, of course, to pus as a whole, not to She serum only. The large quantity of fat in pus is remarkable, as » veil as the amount of albumen—the latter sometimes exceeding -hat contained in the liquor sanguinis. From a vomica.

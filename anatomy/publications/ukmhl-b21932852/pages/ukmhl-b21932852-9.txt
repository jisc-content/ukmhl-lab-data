PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. We have much pleasure iri stating that in preparing the Second Edition of this work Dr. Payne has been by far the chief agent; and that, although we hare supervised and carefully examined his labours, the additions and improvements neces- sary to bring it up to the mark of the present day are entirely his work. We think he has performed his part with great ability, and we trust that the volume now affords to the student a comprehensive summary of all that is important in the science of Pathological Anatomy.

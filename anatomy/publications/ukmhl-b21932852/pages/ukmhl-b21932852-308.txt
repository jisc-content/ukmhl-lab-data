292 THE DURA MATER OF THE SPINAL CORD. Isolated tubercles have been seen, either independently, or asso- ciated with scrofulous disease of the vertebrae; and Dr. Moxon has described a case of miliary tubercle of the spinal dura mater associated with tubercular cerebral meningitis.* A tumour of uncertain character from the dura mater, and compressing the cord, is described and figured by Dr. Cayley, t We should be inclined, although the reporter of the case gives it no name, to regard it as a psammoma, analogous to the growths of the cerebral dura mater which have been so called. * “Trans.

INTESTINAL CHANGES IN DYSENTEUY. 596 These distinctions will generally he sufficient, though cases of difficulty will arise, especially when typhoid ulcers have lasted a long time. The state of the mesenteric glands and of other organs, must then be taken into account. The morbid changes in dysenteiy have their especial seat m the large intestine, the‘'ileum being sometimes (Dr. Copland says very often) involved, but always in a less degree. Our observation quite accords with Bokitansky’s, that, “as a rule its intensity increases from the cLocal valve downwards,” so that the sigmoid flexure and the rectum are found most severely affected. It com- monly runs, Bokitansky says, an acute course, “ though it is fre- quently chronic in the milder degrees; this, however, does not materially alter its character.” Dysenteiy presents itself to the medical observer under a very great variety of forms, but it would be impossible to range the post-mortem appearances m correspond- ing groups. All that can be said in general is, that both the symptoms during life and the textural lesions, will coincide m indicating whether a given case is to he considered of sthenic or asthenic character. Looking then upon dysenteiy generally as inflammation, more or less acute, of the mucous membrane of the large intestine, and premising that it is very prone to pass on into a lingering chronic state, we shaU follow Bokitansky s account of the changes produced by the disease. He considers them " as /ii-rr4c<iViia n-rvfn fmTP natural deerees.” intestinal changes in dysentery. vmcn m a cnroino t the form of open sacs,

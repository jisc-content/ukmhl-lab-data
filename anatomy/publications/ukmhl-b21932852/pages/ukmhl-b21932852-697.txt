MOBBUS BRIGHT!!. 681 beginning to become prominent. The surface of a section shows the thickness of the cortical substance much increased, and the medullary cones also somewhat enlarged, and markedly striated, Â§o as to resemble a plume of feathers; they are usually more con- gested than the cortex. The renal tissue in the latter part appears Fig. 156. 2, Cortical tube, infareted with epithelium, and bulged in a good part of its extent. 3, Cortical tube, containing a dumb-bell crystal of large size. 4, Cortical tube, infareted by epithelium, at (a) below it; some of the separate par- tides are shown more highly magnified. Jh Bulky epithelium from cortical tube, the group at (a) are remarkably enlarged those below them are more or less fatty. * G, Medullary tube much infareted, the contents are seen escaping from the upper to be obscured or confused, as if some coagulating fluid had been effused throughout it; it is commonly marked also by indications of commencing granulations similar to those which are seen on the

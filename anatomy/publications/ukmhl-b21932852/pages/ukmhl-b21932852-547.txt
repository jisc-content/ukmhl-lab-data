531 ADVENTITIOUS PEODUCTS IN THE PLEUEA. ■ the osteoid deposits are mere amorphous aggregations of calca- reous matter, occurring in plates or irregular points : they may be encysted, and occasionally they form pedunculated projections in- vested by the pleura ; to this_ class we may probably refer the case io£ ossification of the lungs given by Dr. Baillie, * for, in the deli- neation, the ossified parts are distinct polypoid off-sets from the pul- monary tissue, though apparently invested by the same membrane. Rokitansky states that fibrous thickenings may occur on the costal ns well as the pulmonary, but that they only ossify on the costal ileura, the subserous osteoid products occurring chiefly in the ntercostal spaces, from which they may be discharged into the cavity of the thorax in the shape of round nodules, that ossifica- ron ot the pleura is generally preceded by some inflammatory Fig. 122. | rit' capsule of the apex of a lung-, in a man aged sixty-three ■ both i is" some It0 5' affected, and like patches were also found on the spleen.

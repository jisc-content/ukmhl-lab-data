At times we find the character of the congestion to be more puncti- form, and to resemble, as Laennec has it, an attempt made to dot over the pleural surface with a paint-brush, with small spots of blood of an irregular shape, and closely approaching one another; it is probable that in many cases this appearance is due, not to the peculiarity of the disease, but to a partial emptying of some ves- sels as a post-mortem effect. The membrane, at the parts most affected, soon loses its natural transparency and gloss, in conse- quence of a secretion from the overcharged vessels investing its surface with a coating of lymph or fibrine, a straw-coloured, semi- Fig. 119.

The outline represents one of two coils of new vessels, seen under the microscope in the fringe of lymph at the lower end. gelatinous effusion which may be easily stripped off from the serous membrane. The microscopic appearances of this fibrine are deli- cate linear fibrillae, of a generally parallel direction, enveloping and entangling the granular and corpuscular forms observed in fibrinous exudation. We very rarely meet with cases of what Andral has termed dry pleurisy, as the effusion is a rapid sequel of the first stages of inflammation; but we frequently have an opportunity of observing a limited production of lymph at one point, while the greater part of the remaining pleura or its fellow, may exhibit the first stage of the disease. This is especially the case on the pleural surface covering blocks of pysomie or Inemor- fhagic infarction. In the recent cases of inflammation occurring m healthy subjects, the effusion presents the appearance of a thin layer of thick cream, which, at the most dependent parts, seems to

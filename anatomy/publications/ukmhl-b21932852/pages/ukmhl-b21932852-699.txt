MORBUS BRIGHTII. 683 cess; it is noticed by Dr. Jobnson as peculiar to that form of disease which he denominates non-desquamative nephritis. The epithelium in this does not accumulate and block up the tubes, but appears as a coarsely granular opaque stratum, of the natural width, resting on the basement membrane. Fig. 15S. a, Tube containing an homogeneous cast, which projects from its broken end. b, Malpighian body, the capsule is filled with oily matter. Besides the swollen and opaque epithelium, cells are sometimes seen which are regarded as indicating proliferation of this structure and have led to this process being described as a “ renal catarrh : ” that is to say, detached, spheroidal masses like epithelium, lying in the middle of the tubes. Where there is no epithelium on the wall of the tube they appear to have been formed out of it, though not of necessity indicating actual cell-proliferation. But more generally the adventitious cells are simple exudation- or pus- corpuscles. The Malpighian tufts are more opaque than natural, the capillaries being obscured by some material contained in the capsule which is probably exudative, but which some pathologists derive from the very delicate epithelium lining the capsule. In some cases this is so abundant, and so mixed with oily matter, that the capsule becomes notably dilated; in others, the pressure of the refluent fluid from the obstructed tube compresses the tuft into a small space at the bottom of the capsule. Oily matter, in the form of minute dark molecules, and various sized drops, is often present in the epithelium in small, sometimes in considerable quantity; when very abundant, it imparts to the kidney a dead milky or yellowish-white aspect. In such cases the epithelial particles often become so filled with oily molecules as to resemble very closely granule cells. In many cases, however, there is no trace

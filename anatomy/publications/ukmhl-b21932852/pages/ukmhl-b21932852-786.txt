CHAPTER XLII. AI3N0RMAD CONDITIONS OF THE OVA KIES AND MAHjI/E. THE OVARIES. Congenital Malformations.—No instance is known of excess in number of the ovaries, but they are sometimes congenitally large, and. then show an excess of fibrous tissue. They are hardly ever found deficient, except when the uterus is wanting also, but sometimes when this is only rudimentary. One ovary is some- times wanting when a bicornute uterus is deficient on the same side. Rudimentary development of the organs is indicated by the want of follicles or their rudiments. Their condition is usually accompanied by the want of sexual character, and by imperfect development of the other generative organs. The imperfection is sometimes unilateral. Displacement of the ovaries is seen in ovarial hernia, where the gland Res in a pouch of intestine, outside the abdominal wall, like a hernial sac. Sometimes the pouch resembles the inguinal canal of the male, and we have an inguinal ovarial hernia. In celebrated case, a double hernia of this kind existed, and both ovaries were removed by operation, with the result, as is well known, of stopping menstruation and aboRshing the female physi- cal characters. As the result of chronic or repeated inflammation, adhesions are often found by which the ovaries are fixed in abnormal situa- tions ; more especially are they found, tied down, behind the uterus. Connection of the Ovaries with Menstruation.—The ovaries of children, who have never menstruated, are perfectly smooth. But after puberty, and when menstruation has occurred, accompanied by the rupture of Graafian vesicles, the surface becomes marked with puckered scars, surrounded by pigmentation. Hence, generally speaking, a perfectly smooth surface is evidence that menstruation has uot taken place. Klob, however, quotes m-

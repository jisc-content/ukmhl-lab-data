HEMATURIA. 672 diminishes in bulk; the wasting being most obvious in the cortical portion. In tbis stage tbe capsule is thickened or splits into layers on removal; it is unduly adherent in parts, or generally leaves a somewhat rough surface with fine uniform elevations, 01 what is called minutely granular. The colour of the surface and the sub- stance is a uniform dark-red, the consistency hard and tough. The last stage of chronic congestion from heart disease much resembles cirrhotic or granular disease of the kidney, to be here- after described, but is distinguished by the characters already given. In the same way, as was shown before, the liver in a state of chronic congestion may approach in some degree to the condition of cirrhosis. . Hcematuria.â€”We may here notice somewhat further the circum- stance of renal hemorrhage. It may occur as an endemic, and, to judge from the absence of bad effects, scarcely serious pheno- menon? Certain individuals are subject to attacks of intermittent hematuria. Many of these are probably instances of what is called Hematmuria, the urine being coloured by blood, but not containing red corpuscles. Turpentine and cantharides have not unfrequently caused renal haemorrhage; they act as irritants upon the organ, and produce a state of conges- tion. Malignant fevers, purpura, and scurvy, are not- un- commonly attended with haematuria, and there is good reason to believe that in most cases the blood comes from the kidney. In some of these affections, characterized by a fluid con- u;-hV,n nf flu. blood, the casts of the tubes would probably be howeverTa condition of atrophy of the epithelium, resultin

1045 THE EYELIDS bundle of orbicularis fibres, called the musculus ciliaris Riolani, is found near the edge of the lid, in front of and behind the efferent ducts of the tarsal glands. A central connective tissue separates the orbicularis muscle from the tarsus in the tarsal division of the lids. In the upper lid this is to be regarded as mainly the anterior or fibrous expansion of the tendon of the levator palpebral, which sends connective-tissue septa between the bundles of the overlying orbicularis (as just mentioned) going to the skin. In the orbital part of this lid the central con- nective tissue includes also the palpebral fascia, lying here immediately beneath the orbicularis muscle; but this soon thins off and fades into the more deeply placed levator expansion. This latter is strengthened by an extension of the sheath of the superior rectus, by which this muscle is enabled to influence the elevation of the lid indirectly. In the lower lid the central connective tissue similarly consists of palpebral fascia, blended with a thin fibrous extension of the sheath of the inferior rectus. Immediately in front of each tarsus is a little loose connective tissue, which contains the large blood-vessels and nerves of the lids. The tarsus of each lid is a stiff plate of close connective tissue, with its sur- faces directed anteriorly and posteriorly; in its substance the tarsal glands are embedded. One tarsal border is free, viz., towards the edge of the lid, the other is attached; the former is straight, while the latter is convex, especially in the upper lid. The length of each tarsus is about twenty millimetres. Its breadth is greatest in the middle of the lid, and becomes gradually smaller towards each canthus, where the tarsi are joined to the outer and inner palpebral ligaments. The breadth of the upper tarsus (10 mm.) is about twice that of the lower. The thick- ness of each is greatest, and its texture closest, at the middle of its length, thin-

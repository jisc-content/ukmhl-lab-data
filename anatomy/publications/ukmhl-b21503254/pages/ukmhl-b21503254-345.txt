THE NOSE 1073 which lines the paranasal sinuses throughout is a continuation of the nasal mucosa; it is, however, paler, less vascular, somewhat thinner, and more loosely attached to the bones. Vessels and nerves.—The arteries of each nasal fossa are the spheno-palatine artery from the internal maxillary (p. 532), the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries from the ophthalmic Fig. 771.—Lateral Wall of the Nose, showing Orifices of Accessory Cavities.

The venous plexuses of the mucous membrane are drained posteriorly by the spheno-palatine to join the pterygoid plexus, superiorly by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins to join the superior ophthalmic vein, and anteriorly by small branches to join the facial. The lymphatics form a 'well- developed plexus which communicates, through the lymphatics surrounding the olfactory nerves, with the subdural and subarachnoid space within the cranial cavity. Posteriorly two or more well-developed trunks communicate with the pharyngeal lymphatics, and anteriorly the nasal lymphatics join with the lymphatics of the face. The olfactory nerves pass through the cribri- form plate of the ethmoid bone and are distributed to the olfactory area (p. 959). The fifth cranial nerve furnishes the following branches to each nasal fossa:—branches from the naso-ciliary

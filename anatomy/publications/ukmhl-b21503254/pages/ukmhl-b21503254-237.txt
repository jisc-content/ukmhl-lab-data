965 THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE The supra-orbital nerve, the largest of the three branches, leaves the orbit at the supra-orbital notch (fig. 701). As it passes through the notch it gives off a small branch which enters the bone and supplies the diploe and t he mucous membrane of the frontal sinus. Its terminal branches give twigs to the pericranium and to the skin of the scalp, the upper eyelid, the frontal region, and the parietal region almost as far as the lambdoid suture (fig. 705). One branch running at the upper margin of the orbital cavity unites with a branch of the facial nerve. The frontal branch, given off at a variable point, lies internal to the supra- orbital, passes through the frontal foramen, and is distributed to the skin of the fore- head and upper eyelid (fig. 701). The supratrochlear branch runs forwards and inwards towards the upper and inner angle of the orbit, where it passes above the pulley of the superior oblique muscle, pierces the palpebral fascia, and ascends to the lower and middle part of the forehead, accompanied by the frontal artery (fig. 701).

Its terminal branches pierce the orbicularis and frontalis, and, as they pass to the skin of the forehead, they communicate with branches of the facial nerve. (6) The Lachrymal Nerve is the smallest of the three branches of the ophthalmic division. It passes through the superior orbital (sphenoidal) fissure external to and slightly below the frontal nerve, and is directed forwards and outwards, along the upper border of the rectus lateralis to the lachrymal gland (fig. 701). On the lateral wall of the orbit it receives a small communicating branch from the zygomatic nerve (the orbital branch of the maxillary nerve). This communicating branch brings to the lachrymal nerve secretory fibres for the lachrymal gland. A small twig passes be- yond the gland, pierces the palpebral fascia, supplies filaments to the conjunctiva, and is then distributed to the integument at the outer canthus of the eye and to the skin over the external angular process.

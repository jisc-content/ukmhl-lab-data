978 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM that it gives filaments to the base of the tongue and to the stylo-glossus and glosso- palatinus (palato-glossus). The Terminal Divisions.—In the substance of the parotid gland the two terminal divisions of the facial nerve lie superficial to the external carotid artery and to the posterior facial (temporo-maxillary) vein. The way in which these terminal divisions give off their branches varies much in different subjects and often on the opposite sides of the same subject. One of the more common methods is here described. The temporo-facial or upper division runs upwards and forwards, and, after receiving communicating twigs from the auriculo-temporal nerve, gives off temporal and zygomatic (malar) branches. The cervico-facial or lower division runs down- wards and forwards, receives branches of communication from the great auricular Fig. 705.—Superficial Distribution of the Facial and other Nerves of the Head.

These branches from the two terminal divisions anastomose freely to form the parotid plexus (pes anserinus). The temporal branches passing upwards communicate freely with each other and with the zygomatic branches. They also communicate with the zygomatico-tem- poral branch of the zygomatic nerve (the orbital branch of the maxillary nerve) and with the supra-orbital nerve. They supply the frontalis, orbicularis oculi, corrugator supercilii, and auricularis anterior and superior (fig. 705). The zygomatic (malar) branches passing upwards and forwards, communicate

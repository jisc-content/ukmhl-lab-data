THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 798 pyramidal tract. The majority of the latter fibres decussate gradually in the com- missural bundle and in the ventral white commissure of the cord as they approach the levels of their termination. The proportion of fibres crossing in the chief decus- sation varies. Cases have been noted in which apparently the entire pyramids decussate at this level. In other cases the direct or ventral pyramidal tract may be Fig. 592.—Transverse Section of Medulla Oblongata at the Level of the Decussation of the Pyramids. nucleus of funiculus gracilis CENTRAL GREY SUBSTANCE \ FUNICULUS CUNEATUS DECUSSATION OF PYRAMIDS PYRAMID much larger than usual, at the expense of the lateral. The decussation usually appears to be symmetrical and it occurs so suddenly that the fibres, in coursing from the ventral to the lateral positions, detach the tips of the ventral horns of the spinal cord from the remainder of the grey figure, and these appear as isolated, irregu- larly shaped masses of grey substance in transverse sections of the medulla. From this level upwards the outline of the grey figure of the cord is lost, and the cell- Fig. 593.—Transverse Section of Medulla Oblongata at Level of the Decltssation of the Lemnisci. posterior median fissure CENTRAL GREY SUBSTANCE \ NUCLEUS OF FUNICULUS GRACILIS i COMMISSURAL NUCLEUS OF ALA CINEREA NUCLEUS OF HYPOGLOSSUS - \ \ > / NUCLEUS OF FUNICULUS CUNEA TI'S RAPHE PYRAMID columns of the ventral horns occur in more or less detached groups as the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves. The origin and decussation of the lemnisci (fillet) begins immediately above the decussation of the pjTamids, and here the arrangements characteristic of the spinal cord are further modified. The dorsal portion of the grey figure of the cord is manifest up to this level, but here, after a considerable increase in its thickness,

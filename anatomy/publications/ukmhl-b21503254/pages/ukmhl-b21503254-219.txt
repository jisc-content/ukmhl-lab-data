947 THE SCIATIC NERVE The sciatic nerve (n. ischiadicus).—The sciatic is not only the largest nerve of the sacral plexus, but it is also the largest nerve in the body. Its terminal branches are chiefly muscular, though some of its fibres are cutaneous. Although it is referred to as one trunk, it consists in reality of peroneal (external) and tibial (internal popliteal) portions, which are bound together by a sheath of fibrous tissue as far as the upper end of the popliteal space. In about 10 per cent, of the cases the two parts remain separate, and in such cases the peroneal (external popliteal) part usually pierces the piriformis. The peroneal portion of the nerve consists of fibres derived from the dorsal branches of the anterior primary divisions of the fourth and fifth lumbar and the first and second sacral nerves, while the tibial part is formed Fig. 693.—A Dissection of the Lumbar and Sacral Plexuses, from behind. (The anterior crural nerve is placed between the external cutaneous and obturator nerves.)

The common trunk leaves the pelvis by passing through the great sacro-sciatic foramen, below the piriformis, and descends through the buttock, running midway between the tuber ischii and the great trochanter (fig. 694). Passing down the thigh, it terminates at the upper angle of the popliteal space by dividing into the common peroneal (external popli- teal) and the tibial (internal popliteal) nerves (fig. 695). The trunk of the nerve lies deeply in the thigh, and it is covered posteriorly by the skin and fascia, the gluteus maximus and the long head of the biceps femoris. Anteriorly it is in

951 THE PLANTAR NERVES the second, third, and fourth, common plantar digitals. Near the bases of the metatarsal bones, the second, third, and fourth divide into proper plantar digital nerves. The first proper plantar digital nerve becomes subcutaneous farther back than the others, and, after sending a branch to the flexor hallucis brevis, passes to the inner side of the great toe. The second (common digital) nerve gives a twig to the first lumbrical and bifurcates to supply the adjacent sides of the first and second toes. The third supplies the adjacent sides of the second and third toes, and the fourth, after communicating with the superficial branch of the lateral plantar nerve, divides to supply the adjacent sides of the third and fourth toes.

Abductor hallucis Flexor digitorum brevis MEDIAL PLANTAR NERVE Medial plantar artery PROPER PLANTAR - DIGITAL NERVE TO INNER SIDE OF HALLUX digital nerves run along the sides of the toes and lie below the corresponding arteries; they supply the joints of the toes, and each gives off a dorsal branch to the skin over the second and terminal phalanges and to the bed of the nail. All of them are con- nected with numerous Pacinian corpuscles. The Lateral Plantar Nerve is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the tibial nerve. It commences at the lower border of the laciniate (internal annular) ligament, or under cover of the origin of the abductor hallucis, and passes forwards and outwards to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone, where it divides into a super- ficial and a deep branch (fig. 696). As it runs forwards and outwards it is superficial to the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus and to the quadratus plantse (flexor

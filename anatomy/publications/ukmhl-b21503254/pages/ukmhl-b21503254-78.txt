THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 806 inferior nucleus (nucleus spinalis). The latter is a downward prolongation of the general nucleus vestibularis which accompanies the descending root of the nerve. From the cells of the lateral and inferior nuclei axones are given off which form reflex paths to the lateral column of the spinal cord (vestibulo-spinal fasciculus, fig. 571). From both the lateral nucleus and the superior nucleus a special path is given off which passes upwards and terminates in the nucleus fastigii (cerebelli) of the opposite side and in the nucleus dentatus and the cortex of the vermis. Also, fibres arising in the nuclei fastigii are said to terminate in the lateral (Deiters') nucleus in addition to those which descend into the ventral marginal fasciculus of the spinal cord. From the medial and also from the superior nucleus fibres pass to the medial longitudinal fasciculus of both sides, and are distributed to the nucleus of the abducens of the same side and to the nuclei of the trochlear and oculomotor nerves and of the motor portion of the trigeminus of the same and opposite sides. Other fibres arising in the vestibular nucleus ascend to the lateral portion of the thalamus. Many of the anatomical details of the central connections of the vestibular nerve have not yet been determined with exactness. In addition to whatever other func- tions it may have, it is considered to be the nerve of equilibration, and the connec- Fig. 600.â€”Transverse Section op Medulla at Inferior Border of Pons.

The fibres of the apparatus which are represented in the spinal cord are supposed to convey impulses to the ventral horn (motor) cells of the cord as far down as the lum- bar region. (2) The cochlear nerve, probably the auditory nerve proper, arises as the central processes of the bipolar cells of the spiral ganglion of the cochlea. In the lateral periphery of the restiform body, just as it enters the pons, the nerve finds its two nuclei of termination, the ventral nucleus and the dorsal miclciis (tuberculum acusti- cum, fig. 591). From the dorsal nucleus arise the stria? medullares acustici. These bundles, more or less inconstant in man, pass around the dorsal aspect of the restiform body and course just under the ependyma of the floor of the fourth ventricle to the mid-line, where they suddenly turn downwards into the substance of the medulla, and in doing so, cross to the opposite side and join the lemniscus. As the lemniscus becomes separated higher up into a medial and lateral portion, these fibres course in the lateral lemniscus and are distributed chiefly to the grey substance of the inferior quadri- geminate body of that-side. From the Ventral nucleus of termination fibres arise which terminate about the

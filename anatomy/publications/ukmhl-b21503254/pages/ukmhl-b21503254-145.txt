873 SUMMARY OF CONDUCTION PATHS 4. Cells of nuclei of pons send fibres by way of brachium pontis (middle cerebellar peduncle) to cortex of cerebellar hemisphere, probably of opposite side to that of the origin of the cerebral fibres connecting with the cells (fig. 606J. C. Descending cerebellospinal paths. 1. From cells of nucleus fastigii and probably from other nuclei and from cortex of cerebellum, of same and opposite sides, into anterior marginal fasciculus of spinal cord (fig. 571), and thence to the cells of the anterior horn.

The part from the red nucleus (rubro-spinal tract) decussates in the ventral portion of the tegmentum of the mesencephalon and passes through the medulla oblongata in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, while that from Deiters' nucleus traverses the medulla in the reticular formation.

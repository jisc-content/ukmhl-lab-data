815 THE MESENCEPHALON This is the posterior commissure of the cerebrum, and contains commissural fibres arising in both the thalamencephalon and mesencephalon. The triangular area bounded by the stem of the epiphysis, the thalamus, and the superior colliculus with its brachium, is known as the habenular trigone. Inferiorly, the lamina quadrigemina is continuous with the brachia conjunctiva or superior cerebellar peduncles, and with the anterior medullary velum which bridges between the mesial margins of these peduncles. The narrowed upper end of the velum, the part directly below the inferior quadrigeminate bodies, is thickened into a well-defined white band known as the frenulum veli. From the lateral margins of this band on each side and just below the inferior quadrigeminate bodies emerge the trochlear nerves (the fourth pair of cranial nerves), and the increased thickness of the band is largely due to the decussation of this pair of nerves taking place within it. The brachium conjunctivum, together with the inferior and superior colliculi of each side, form a marked ridge which results in the lateral sulcus of the mesencepha- Fig. 607.—Dorsal Surface of Mesencephalon and Adjacent Parts.

The ridge is thickened laterally by the lateral lemniscus, which is disposed as a band of white substance passing obliquely upwards from the brachium pontis, applied to the lateral surface of the brachium conjunctivum and which enters the lateral margin of the mesencephalon. The ventral surface of the mesencephalon is formed by the cerebral peduncles (crura), two large bundles of white substance which are close to one another at the superior margin of the pons, but immediately diverge at a wide angle, producing the interpeduncular fossa, and in so doing pass upwards and lateralwards to disappear beneath the optic tracts (fig. 580). The posterior recess of the interpeduncular fossa extends slightly under the superior margin of the pons, while its anterior recess is occupied by the corpora mammillaria of the prosencephalon. The triangular floor of the fossa is the posterior perforated substance, a greyish area presenting numer-

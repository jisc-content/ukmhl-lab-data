THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 958 The cranial nerves, like the spinal nerves, are developed from cells of the primitive neural tube and, beginning with the fifth pair downwards, all the sensory nerves are developed from the cells of the neural crest like the sensory components or dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. Otherwise between the cranial nerves and the spinal nerves there are many important differences. Each spinal nerve has a dorsal or sensory root, which springs from the cells of a spinal ganglion; a ventral or motor root, whose fibres are processes of the nerve-cells which are situated in the walls of the central system, and at their attachment to the surface of the cord the two roots are some distance apart. Only two cranial nerves correspond at all closely with typical spinal nerves; they are the fifth and the seventh nerves,each of which possesses Fig. 698.—Surface Attachment of the Cranial Nerves.

But even in these cases, where the similarity between the cranial and spinal nerves is greatest, there are still points of difference, which if not essential are very obvious, for in the case of the fifth cranial nerve the motor root unites not with the whole but only with one branch of the sensory portion. In both cases the motor and sensory roots are only slightly separated from each other at their attachment to the surface of the brain. All the other cranial nerves differ in a still more marked manner from typical spinal nerves. The first nerve is an afferent nerve whose cells of origin are situated in the mucous membrane of the nose, an organ of special sense, and its fibres are not collected to- gether into a nerve-trunk, but pass, as a number of small bundles, through the lamina

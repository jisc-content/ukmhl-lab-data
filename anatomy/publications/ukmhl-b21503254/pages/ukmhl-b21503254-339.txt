It consists of the external nose, the nasal cavity, and the paranasal sinuses (accessory cavities). The external nose (fig. 764) is shaped like a triangular pyramid.

The superior part of the dorsum is known as the bridge. Inferiorly, overhanging the upper lip, is the base of the nose, which presents two orifices, the nares or nostrils, separated from one another by the inferior movable part of the nasal septum. The sides of the nose slope from the dorsum laterally and dorsally, and inferiorly are expanded and more convex, forming the alae nasi. Each of these is separated from the rest of the lateral surface by a sulcus, and the inferior free border of each bounds a naris laterally. The framework of the external nose is formed partly of bone and partly of hyaline cartilage. The bones, which form only the smaller superior part, are the two nasal

THE FORNIX 849 The anterior columns or pillars of the fornix are two separate, cylindrical bundles which pass forwards from the apex of the body of the fornix and then turn sharply downwards along the anterior boundary of the third ventricle, just behind the anterior cerebral commissure. A part of each column, the free portion, forms the anterior boundary of the interventricular foramen (Monroi). Thence it sinks into the grey substance of the lateral wall of the third ventricle (the covered portion), and passes ventralwards to the base of the brain, where it appears on the exterior as the corpus mammillare (fig. 619). Some of its fibres are interrupted in the nuclei of the corpus mammillare, chiefly in its lateral nucleus; probably most of them merely double back, forming a genu. From the corpus mammillare the fibres are disposed in Fig. 631.—Horizontal Section of Telencephalon showing Body of Fornix as seen from Below and the Anterior Commissure in Section.

" CORPUS CALLOSUM LONGITUDINAL FISSURE MEDIAL SURFACE OF HEMISPHERE at least three ways:—(1) The greater part perhaps pass directly upwards and are lost in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, where they ramify freely and terminate among its cells. These fibres form the bundle known as the thalamo-mammillary fascicu- lus, or bundle of Vicq d'Azyr; (2) a portion of the fibres join the cerebral peduncle near by as the pedunculo-mammillary fasciculus, and pass caudalwards. The destination of these is still obscure. Probably they go to the interpeduncular ganglion, the red nucleus, and the nuclei of the medulla oblongata; (3) a portion of the fibres decussate in the basal or dorsal parts of the corpora mammillaria and are distributed to both the thalamus and cerebral peduncle of the opposite side. 54

THE PROJECTION FIBERS OF THE HEMISPHERES 865 the thalamus. From the thalamus the projection fibres of this system pass in the general thalamo-cortical path to the somaesthetic area. The descending projection fibres arise as outgrowths of the pyramidal cells of the respective regions of the cerebral cortex, in which the ascending fibres terminate. The principal groups of these are as follows:— (1) The pyramidal fasciculi. The fibres of this group arise from the giant pyramidal cells of the posterior central gyri and anterior end of the paracentral lobule Fig. 644.—Diagrams showing the General Sensory and Association Areas op the Convex and Medial Surfaces of Cerebral Hemisphere.

They descend through the middle part of the corona radiata, the genu and anterior two-thirds of the occipital portion of the internal capsule, into the basis of the peduncle, thence through the cerebral peduncle and pyramid of the medulla, and decussate to pass down the spinal cord to terminate about the cells of the ventral horn—the origin of the motor roots of the spinal nerves.

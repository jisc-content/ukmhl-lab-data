THE THALAMUS 859 nucleus, like the claustrum, is thought to represent a detached portion of the cortex—probably from the region of the uncus. Considering this and its chief connection, it may be concerned in the central portion of the olfactory apparatus with the stria terminalis, which thus may be somewhat homologous to the fornix. The thalamus and hypothalamus.—The external features of these portions of the prosencephalon have been described in their natural place, but inasmuch as they contain the chief relays and connections between the telencephalon and the divisions of the nervous system below the prosencephalon, the consideration of their internal structure has been deferred till now. The principal grey masses to be considered are the thalamus and the hypothalamic nucleus.

The thalamus has upon its upper surface a thin stratum zonale of white sub- stance, derived in part from the optic tract and in part from its own cells. Its oblique lateral surface conforms to the inner surface of the internal capsule; its vertical medial surface forms the lateral wall of the third ventricle, and below it is continuous into the hypothalamic (tegmental) region. Its dorsal surface shows a middle, an anterior, and a posterior prominence or tubercle. The anterior tubercle forms the posterior boundary of the interventricular foramen; the posterior tubercle is the cushion-like pulvinar which projects backwards over the lateral geniculate body and the brachium of the anterior quadrigeminate body.

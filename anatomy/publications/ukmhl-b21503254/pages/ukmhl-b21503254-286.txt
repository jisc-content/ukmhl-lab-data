1014 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM with the abdominal aortic and superior mesenteric plexuses. It lies in the epigastric region of the abdomen behind the bursa omentalis (lesser sac of the peritoneum) and the pancreas, upon the crura of the diaphragm and over the abdominal aorta, and around the origin of the cceliac and the superior mesenteric arteries. It occupies the interval between the suprarenal bodies and extends downwards as far as the renal arteries. It is formed by the great and the lesser splanchnic nerves of both sides, by cceliac branches of the right vagus, and by filaments from the upper lumbar ganglia of Fig. 721.—Abdominal Plexuses of the Sympathetic.

It sometimes receives cceliac branches from the left vagus. It contains two large ganglia, the right and left cceliac (semilunar) ganglia (fig. 721). The cceliac (semilunar) ganglia are two large, flat, irregularly shaped masses, separable into a varying number of ganglia. These two masses, or rather the smaller ganglia which compose them, are connected by a varying number of com- municating branches. Each mass, right and left, lies upon the corresponding crus of the diaphragm, at the inner border of the corresponding suprarenal body, being sometimes overlapped by this body. The right mass lies behind the inferior vena cava. Each cceliac ganglion receives at its upper border the greater splanchnic

863 THE PROJECTION FIBRES OF THE HEMISPHERES mus with the cortex belong to the projection system. Some of the fibre bundles of the above systems have already been described in connection with the parts with which they are concerned. The projection fibres of the hemisphere comprise both ascending and descending fibres between the cerebral cortex and structures below the bounds of the hemisphere, i.e., some arise in the structures below and terminate in the cortex; others arise from the cortical cells and terminate in the structures below, including the grey substance of the thalamencephalon, mesencephalon, rhombencephalon, and spinal cord. The projection fibres are given different names in the hemisphere according to their arrangement and the appearances to which they contribute in the dissections. Beginning with the basis of the peduncle, they contribute—(1) to the internal capsule and some to the external capsule and (2) to the corona radiata. The internal capsule is a band of white substance, consisting of the ascending fibres from the nuclei of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and corpus striatum, reinforced by the descending fibres from the cortex to these nuclei and by those descending in the cerebral peduncle to reach the structures below the prosencephalon.

CENTRAL GREY SUBSTANCE MEDIAL LEMNISCUS PYRAMID - VAGUS NERVE broad, fan-like mass of fibres, which increases in width from the base of the hemi- sphere upwards, and which is spread between the lenticular nucleus on its outer side and the caudate nucleus and thalamus on its inner side. To reach the cortex above, its fibres necessarily pass through the radiations of the corpus callosum, and thus, together with the corpus callosum, the fan-like bands of the two hemispheres form a capsule containing the thalami, the third ventricle, the caudate nuclei, and the ante- rior and central portions of the lateral ventricles. In sections, each internal capsule appears bent at an angle, the genu, which approaches the cavity of the lateral ventricle along the line of the boundary between the thalamus and the caudate nucleus. Along the genu runs the stria terminalis of the thalamus, and through the genu the capsule receives fibres from the internal medullary lamina of the thalamus, from the stratum zonale of the thalamus and from that of the caudate nucleus. At the genu each capsule is separable into two parts:—(1) the frontal portion, spreading between the caudate and lenticular nuclei; (2) the occipital portion, between the lenticular nucleus and the thalamus.

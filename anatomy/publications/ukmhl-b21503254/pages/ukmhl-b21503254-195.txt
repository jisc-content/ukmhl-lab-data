THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS 923 muscles at the back of the forearm, where it comes into relation with the posterior interosseous artery, and accompanies it across the abductor pollicis longus. At the lower border of the latter muscle it gives off a branch to the extensor pollicis longus, and another which crosses this muscle to the extensor indicis proprius. Continuing distal wards as the dorsal antibrachial interosseous nerve it leaves the posterior inter- osseous artery, dips beneath the extensor pollicis longus, and comes into relation with the anterior interosseous artery. It accompanies this artery upon the interosseous membrane and the back of the radius, passes through the groove for the extensor digi- torum communis and extensor indicis proprius to the back of the wrist, and terminates Fig. 681.â€”A Dissection of the Cutaneous Nerves on the Dorsal Aspect of the Hand and Fingers. (H. St. J. B.) The branches of the median nerve are shown in black in a gangliform enlargement which gives branches to the carpal articulations. The muscles supplied by the deep radial (posterior interosseous) nerve are the extensor carpi radialis bfevis, brachio-radialis (supinator longus), extensor digitorum com- munis, extensor digiti quinti proprius, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor indicis pro- prius, and the extensor muscles of the thumb. The supinator (brevis) receives two twigs, one of which is given off before the nerve pierces the muscle and the other while it is passing through it. The superficial radial (radial) nerve is somewhat smaller than the deep radial (posterior interosseous), and is a purely cutaneous nerve. It runs downwards under cover of the brachio-radialis, passing in front of the elbow-joint, the radial recurrent

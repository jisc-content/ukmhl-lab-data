937 THE LUMBAR PLEXUS nerve. A short distance below the anterior superior spine it passes through the in- ternal oblique muscle, and then descends in the inguinal canal to the subcutaneous inguinal (external abdominal) ring, through which it emerges into the thigh on the outer side of the spermatic cord (fig. 686). It is distributed to the skin of the upper and inner part of the thigh, in the male to the root of the penis and to the skin of the root of the scrotum through the anterior scrotal nerves (fig. 691), and in the female to the mons veneris and labium majus through the anterior labial nerves. Not uncommonly the ilio-inguinal nerve is blended with the ilio-hypogastric nerve Fig. 687.â€”Diagram of a Common Form of Lumbo-sacral Plexus. (Modified from Paterson.)

It may be replaced by branches of the genito-femoral (genito- crural) nerve, or it may replace that nerve or the lateral cutaneous nerve. The Genito-femoral (genito-crural) Nerve is connected with the first and second lumbar nerves, but the majority of its fibres are derived from the second nerve. It passes obliquely forwards and downwards through the psoas and emerges from the anterior surface of that muscle, close to its internal border, at the level of the lower border of the third lumbar vertebra. After emerging from the substance of the

765 THE SPINAL CORD Fig. 569.—(Continued.) Fig. 569.—Transverse Sections from Different Segments of the Spinal Cord, showing Shape and Relative Proportions of Grey and White Substance in the Differ- ent Segments Represented. Coccygeal axones of the spinal cord course longitudinally and thus coursing, form the thick man- tle surrounding the column of grey substance. This mantle is divided into right and left homolateral halves by the anterior median fissure along its ventral aspect, and along its dorsal aspect by the posterior septum, which is for the most part a connective- tissue partition derived from the pia mater along the line of the posterior median sulcus. The mantle is supported internally by interwoven neuroglia and white fibrous connective tissue, the latter, derived chiefly from the pia mater, closely invest- ing it without.

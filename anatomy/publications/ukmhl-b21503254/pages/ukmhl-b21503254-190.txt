918 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM thoracic nerves; and (3) the posterior cord, by the posterior branches of all of these cervical nerves. The plexus extends from the outer border of the scalenus anterior, where the roots of its constituent nerves appear, to the lower border of the pectoralis minor, where each of its three cords divides into two terminal branches, and it lies in the posterior triangle, in the root of the neck, and in the axillary fossa. In the posterior triangle and the root of the neck it is in relation behind with the scalenus medius (figs. 675, Fig. 679.â€”The Brachial Plexus and Branches of the Region of the Neck and Shoulder.

In the posterior triangle it is covered superficially by the skin and superficial fascia, the platysma, the supra-clavicular branches of the cervical plexus, and the deep fascia, and it is crossed by the lower part of the external jugular vein, by the nerve to the subclavius, the transverse cervical vein and the transverse scapular (supra- scapular) vein, the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, and by the transverse cervical artery. At the root of the neck it lies behind the clavicle and the sub- clavius muscle, and the transverse scapular (suprascapular) artery crosses in front

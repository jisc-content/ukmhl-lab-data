THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 786 side, and thus such axones are the encephalic continuation of the central sensory pathway conveying impulses from the periphery of one side of the body to the opposite side of the cerebrum. The crossing of these axones is known as the decus- sation of the lemnisci. With the termination of the dorsal funiculi and the ventral course of the fibres of the lemnisci in their decussation, the central canal of the spinal cord loses its roof of nervous tissue in the medulla and comes to the surface as the fourth ventricle. The floor of the fourth ventricle, which corresponds to the floor of the central canal, is considerably widened into two lateral recesses opposite the junction of the cere- bellar peduncles of either side, and, being pointed at both its superior and inferior extremities, it is rhomboidal in shape and thus is the fossa rhomboidea. The pia mater of the spinal cord is maintained across the tip of the calamus scriptorius to form the obex, a small, non-nervous, semilunar lamina roofing over the immediate opening of the central canal. THE PONS The pons (Varolii) is, for the most part, a great commissure or 'bridge' of white substance coursing about the ventral aspect of the brain-stem, and connecting the cerebellar hemisphere of one side with that of the other. In addition it contains fibres passing both to and from the structures of the brain-stem and the grey sub- stance of the cerebellum. Each of its lateral halves forms the middle of the three cerebellar peduncles, the brachium pontis. â€¢ In size it naturally varies directly with the development of the cerebellum, both in a given animal and relatively throughout the .animal series. In man it attains its

THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 792 from the base of one of the dendrites, and pass outwards into the molecular layer, where they bifurcate and course in both directions parallel to the long axis of the folium, to become associated with the dendrites of the cells of Purkinje. In the layer of the cells of Purkinje there is situated at intervals a neurone of the Golgi type II (see fig. 555). The short, elaborately branched axone of this neurone is distributed among the cells of the granular layer. Axones conveying impulses to the cerebellar cortex terminate in the granular layer as 'moss fibres,' or directly upon the cells of Purkinje as 'climbing fibres,' and probably upon the cells of the Golgi type II. Thus the neurones which receive impulses coming to the cortex are the cells of Purkinje, probably the Golgi cells of type II, and the granule-cells; those which distribute these impulses to other neurones of the folium are the Golgi cells of type II, the granule-cells, and the basket-cells (association neurones), and the collaterals of the cells of Purkinje. Impulses are conveyed from the cortex of a folium to that of other folia, lamina, lobules or lobes, or to the nuclei of the cere- bellum, or to structures outside the cerebellum by the axones of the cells of Purkinje. The nuclei of the cerebellum are in its central core of white substance. They are four in number, and all are paired, those of each pair being situated opposite each other on either side of the mid-line. 1. The largest of them is the dentate nucleus. This is an isolated mass of grey substance situated in the core of white substance of each hemisphere. It is in the form of a folded or corrugated cup-shaped lamina, with the opening of the cup Fig. 588.—Section of Cerebellum and Brain-stem Passing Obliquely Through Inferior Portion of Cerebellum to Anterior Margin of Pons.

It contains a mass of white substance and possesses a capsule. 2. The nucleus emboliformis is an oblong and much smaller mass of grey substance, which lies immediately internal to the hilus of the dentate nucleus. It is probably of the same significance as the dentate nucleus, being merely a portion separated from it. 3. The nucleus globosus, the smallest of the cerebellar nuclei, is an irregular horizontal mass of grey substance with its larger end placed in front . It lies close to the inner side of the nucleus emboliformis, and often appears separated into two or more rounded or globular masses. 4. The nucleus f astigii (roof nucleus) is the second largest of the cerebellar nuclei, and is the most mesially placed. The pair is situated in the roof of the fourth ven- tricle, and so near the mid-line that both nuclei are in the white substance of the vermis. They are ovoid in shape, and the nucleus of one side receives axones from the nucleus of the vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve chiefly of the oppo- site side, the decussation of these axones taking place in the vermis. Its cells are larger than those of the two first-mentioned nuclei. The peduncles of the cerebellum.—The peduncles consist of three pairs—the

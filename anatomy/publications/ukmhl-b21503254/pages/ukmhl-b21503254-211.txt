THE FEMORAL NERVE 939 The outer branch pierces the sartorius and both become cutaneous about the junc- tion of the upper and middle thirds of the thigh (figs. 689 and 691). They descend along the inner part of the front of the thigh to the knee, supplying the skin in the lower two-thirds of the inner part of the front of the thigh, and their terminal fila- ments take part in the formation of the patellar plexus. About the middle of the thigh it often communicates with the lumbo-inguinal nerve (crural branch of the genito-crural nerve). The internal cutaneous nerve runs downwards and inwards Fig. 688.—Lumbosacral Plexus. (After Toldt, " Atlas of Human Anatomy," Rebman, London and New York.)

Before this division takes place, however, two or three collateral branches are given off from the trunk. The highest of these passes through the fossa ovalis (saphenous opening), or it pierces the deep fascia immediately below the opening, and supplies the skin as low as the middle of the thigh. The lowest pierces the deep fascia at the middle of the thigh and it descends in the subcutaneous tissue, supplying the skin on the inner side of the thigh from the middle of the thigh

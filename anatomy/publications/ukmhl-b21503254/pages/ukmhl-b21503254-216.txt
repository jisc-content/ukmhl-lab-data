THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 944 ceive fibres from the third lumbar nerve or be formed entirely from the fifth. At its formation it is situated on the ala of the sacrum under cover of the psoas. It de- scends into the pelvis, and, as it crosses the anterior border of the ala of the sacrum, it emerges from beneath the psoas at the inner side of the obturator nerve, from which it is separated by the ilio-lumbar artery. It passes behind the common iliac vessels and unites with the first and second sacral nerves, forming with them the upper trunk of the sacral plexus. SACRAL NERVES The anterior primary divisions of the upper four sacral nerves enter the pelvis through the anterior sacral foramina and they diminish in size progressively from above downwards. The first sacral is the largest of the spinal nerves, the second is slightly smaller than the first, while the third and fourth are relatively small. The fifth sacral nerve is still smaller than the fourth; it enters the pelvis between the sacrum and the coccyx. The anterior divisions of these nerves enter into the formation of three parts of the lumbo-sacral plexus, the sacral, pudendal, and coccygeal. Sacral Plexus The sacral plexus shows in its formation variations similar to those of the lumbar plexus; hence there are also seven types of this plexus, three of them belonging to the prefixed or proximal class, three to the postfixed or distal class, and one to the ordinary class. The following tables show the range of variation and the common arrangement in these classes:â€” Composition of the Nerves op the Sacral Plexus Range of Variation Nerve. Proximal. Ordinary. Distal.

The ordinary type of sacral plexus is commonly formed by the smaller part of the anterior division of the fourth lumbar nerve and the entire anterior division of the fifth lumbar nerve, together with the first and parts of the second and third sacral nerves. The plexus lies in the pelvis on the anterior surface of the piriformis (fig. 692) and behind the pelvic fascia and the branches of the hypogastric (internal iliac) artery.

827 THE TELENCEPHALON structures of the floor of the anterior and ventral portion of the third ventricle. The area extends anteriorly from the corpora mammillaria in the interpeduncular fossa, and includes the tuber cinereum and hypophysis behind the optic chiasma, and some of the anterior perforated substance in front of it. The most anterior portion of the third ventricle is in the form of a ventral ex- tension. The wall of this portion is almost wholly non-nervous and quite thin, and thus the cavity of the ventricle is but thinly separated from the exterior of the brain. The front portion of this wall is the lamina terminalis and in the ventri- cular side of the dorsal part of this lamina the anterior commissure of the brain Fig. 616.—Ventral Aspect of Brain-stem Including Mammillary and Optic Portions of the Hypothalamus. insula OLFACTORY TRACT HYPOPHYSIS ANTERIOR £ PERFORATED —I SUBSTANCE CORPORA MA MMIL-.

The optic chiasma lies across and presses into the lower portion of the lamina terminalis, and in so doing produces an anterior recess in the cavity of the ventricle known as the optic recess. The posterior and most evident part of this portion of the wall of the third ventricle bulges slightly, giving the outward appearance known as the tuber cinereum, and the cavity bounded by this termin- ates in the infundibular recess. The tuber cinereum then is a hollow, conical projection of the floor of the third ventricle, between the- corpora mammillaria and the optic chiasma. Its wall is continuous anteriorly with the lamina terminalis and laterally with the anterior perforated substance.

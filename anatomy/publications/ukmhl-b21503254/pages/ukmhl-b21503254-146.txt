THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 874 VI. The Auditory Conduction Paths A. Vestibular division (vestibular nerve). 1. Vestibular ganglion gives origin to the peripheral utricular and three ampullar branches and to the combined and centrally directed vestibular nerve. 2. Lateral vestibular nucleus (Deiters'), medial nucleus, superior nucleus, and nucleus of descending vestibular root (nuclei of termination) give origin to fibres as follows:— (a) From lateral and superior nuclei to nucleus fastigii of opposite side and to cortex of vermis and to dentate nucleus (cerebellar connection). (b) From medial and superior nuclei to nuclei of origin of eye-muscle nerves of same and opposite sides, by way of medial longitudinal fasciculi. (c) From lateral nucleus and nucleus of descending root through reticular formation into lateral funiculus of spinal cord. (d) It is probable that all the nuclei of termination give off fibres bearing ascending impulses which ultimately reach the somsesthetic area, but the course pursued and neurones involved in such a chain are uncertain.

Cochlear division (cochlear nerve). . , 1. Spiral ganglion of the cochlea gives origin to short peripheral fibres to organ of Corti, and to the centrally directed cochlear nerve _ 2 Dorsal and ventral nuclei of the cochlear nerve (nuclei of termination). (a) Stria? medullares arise from dorsal nucleus and pass around outer side of resti- form body (acoustic tubercle), then median wards under ependyma of floor of fourth ventricle to mid-line, then ventralwards into tegmentum, where it decussates and joins trapezoid body to lateral lemniscus of opposite side. (b) Fibres arising in ventral nucleus pass ventrally medianwards and some terminate in the superior olivary nucleus of same side; others pass by way of trapezoid body and lateral lemniscus to terminate in superior olivary nucleus, nucleus of lateral lemniscus, medial geniculate body and nucleus of inferior quadrigeminate body of the opposite side. . 3 Nuclei of superior olivls of both sides and nucleus of lateral lemniscus send fibres by way of lateral lemniscus to inferior quadrigeminate body and through inferior brachium to medial geniculate body, and some may pass uninterrupted, even to the cortex of the temporal lobe.

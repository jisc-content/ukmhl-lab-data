912 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus The superficial branches are described, according to the direction in which they run, as ascending, transverse, and descending branches. The ascending branches are the small occipital and the great auricular nerves. There is only one transverse Fig. 675.—Origin of the Cervical and Brachial Plexus.

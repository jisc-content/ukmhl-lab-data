ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 1068 bones and the frontal processes and anterior nasal spines of the two maxilla? (pp. 76- 80). The nasal cartilages.—There are five principal cartilages: superiorly, the two lateral nasal cartilages, inferiorly the two greater alar (lower lateral) cartilages, and the single median nasal septal cartilage. Besides these there are the lesser alar cartilages, the sesamoid cartilages, and the vomero-nasal cartilages of Jacobson. The Fig. 765.—Ventral View of the External Nose, showing its Cartilages, etc. NASAL BONE NASAL PROCESS OF THE MAXILLA LATERAL NASAL CARTILAGE LATERAL CRUS OF GREATER ALAR CARTILAGE lateral nasal cartilages are triangular and nearly flat lateral expansions of the septal cartilage, placed one on each side of the nose just inferior to the nasal bone. Each presents an inner and an outer surface and three borders. The medial bor- der is continuous in its superior third with the ventro-superior margin of the sep- tal cartilage, and through this with its fellow of the opposite side, but it is separated inferiorly from the septal cartilage by a narrow cleft. The curved dorso-lateral Fig. 766.—Inferior View of the External Nose, showing its Cartilages, etc. nasal septal cartilage LATERAL CRUS OF GREATER ALAR CARTILAGE MEDIAL CRUS OF GREATER ALAR CARTILAGE ANTERIOR NASAL SPINE OF THE MAXILLA NASAL SEPTAL CARTILAGE Cellular tissue of ala border is firmly attached by strong fibrous tissue to the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla, and underlies these bones for a considerable distance, especially near the septum. The inferior border is connected by fibrous tissue to the greater alar cartilage. The greater alar (lower lateral) cartilages are situated one on each side of the tip of the nose (figs. 764, 766). Each is thin, pliant, curved, and so folded that it forms a medial and a lateral crus, which bound and tend to hold open each naris. The medial crus is loosely attached to its fellow of the opposite side, the two being

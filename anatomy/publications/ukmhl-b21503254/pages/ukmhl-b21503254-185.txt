It pierces the deep cervical fascia and passes across the posterior part of the insertion of the sterno-mastoid into the superficial fascia of the scalp, in which it breaks up into auricular, mastoid, and occipital terminal branches, (a) The auricular branch runs upwards and slightly forwards to reach the integument on the upper median part of the pinna, to which it is distributed, (b) The mastoid branch is distributed to the skin covering the base of the mastoid process, (c) The occipital branches ramify over the occipitalis Fig. 676.â€”Diagram of the Cervical Plexus.

The branches of the small occipital nerve anastomose with twigs of the posterior auricular, great auricular, and great occipital nerves (fig. 677). (2) The Great Auricular Nerve arises from the second and third cervical nerves (figs. 675j 676). It accompanies the small occipital to the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, but at that point it diverges from the small occipital (fig. 677) and runs upwards and forwards across the sterno-mastoid towards the angle of the mandible. When it is about half-way across the muscle it begins to break up into its terminal branches, which are named, according to the area of their distribution, 58

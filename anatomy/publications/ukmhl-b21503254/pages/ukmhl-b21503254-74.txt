802 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM wise, those passing from the restiform body to the opposite olive are deflected by the olive of the same side and pursue a similar course to the raphe. While out of the hilus of each olive streams a dense mass of white substance, yet many of the fibres concerned with the olive pierce its walls from all sides. Many of the external arcuate fibres are said to be interrupted in the nucleus arcuatus. This is a thin sheet of grey substance, variable in amount, which lies on the ventral aspect of each pyramid, and, though it decreases inferiorly, it may be evident down to the decussation of the pyramids. The nucleus receives its name from the fact that its larger portion is interpolated in the course of the external arcuates.

The arcuate fibres of longer course, like the olives with which they are largely concerned, have no homologues in the spinal cord. The central canal of the closed portion of the medulla is surrounded by a greater amount of grey substance, substantia grisea centralis, than is the canal in the spinal cord. This is largelv gelatinous substance, the central gelatinous substance, and the nerve-fibres in coursing through the grey substance are partially deflected by it, leaving it as a cylindrical, more evident area of grey substance than in other regions. In the open portion of the medulla the substantia grisea centralis naturally forms a more transparent lamina just under the floor of the fourth ventricle. In the mesen- cephalon it again surrounds the reformed canal or aquseductus cerebri.

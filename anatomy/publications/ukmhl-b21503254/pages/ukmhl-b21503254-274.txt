1002 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Splanchnic efferent fibres from the rhombencephalon pass outwards to the sym- pathetic in the roots of the facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus, and spinal accessory nerves, all of which have more or less irregularly disposed communicating rami. The ganglia of origin of the vagus, more than perhaps any other nerve, both give origin to and receive impulses from splanchnic efferent fibres. Likewise, twigs of other cranial nerves, especially of the trigeminus, connect with the small sympathetic ganglia of the head. The meningeal branches given by certain of the cranial nerves contain vaso-motor fibres, and these correspond to the sympathetic fibres in the recurrent branches and in the roots of the spinal nerves.

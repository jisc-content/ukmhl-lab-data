THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 842 The angular gyrus is the portion which embraces the posterior end of the superior temporal sulcus, and is continuous behind this into the middle temporal gyrus and in front with the superior temporal gyrus. Its shape is usually such as to suggest its name. The most posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule, when arching in a similar way about the end of the middle temporal sulcus and continuous with the temporal gyri on its either side, is known as the post-parietal gyrus. This is a smaller area than either of the other two, and, owing to the variability of the end of the middle temporal sulcus, is not always evident. The mesial surface of the parietal lobe is divided into two parts by the marginal portion of the sulcus cinguli. The anterior and smaller part is the mesial continuation of the posterior central gyrus, and comprises the posterior portion of the paracentral lobule. It is limited from the part of this lobule belonging to the frontal lobe by a vertical line drawn from the marginal extremity of the central sulcus. The praecu- neus (quadrate lobule) is the posterior and larger part of the mesial surface of the parietal lobe. It is separated from the cuneus of the occipital lobe by the parieto- occipital fissure, and is imperfectly separated from the gyrus cinguli (limbic lobe) Fig. 626.—Outline Drawing of Mesial Surface of Left Cerebral Hemisphere.

The occipital lobe.—This is a relatively small, trifacial, pyramidal segment, comprising the posterior extremity of the hemisphere, its apex being the occipital pole. Though one of the natural divisions of the cerebral hemisphere, it is very in- definitely marked off from the lobes anterior to it. Though it contains the cortical area of the visual apparatus, only in the brains of man and the apes does it occur as a well-defined projection. In most of the mammalia it is not differentiated at all. Its three surfaces comprise a convex, a mesial, and a tentorial surface. Its convex surface is separated from that of the parietal and temporal lobes by the superior and external extremity of the parieto-occipital fissure, and by an arbitrary line drawn transversely from this extremity to t he infero-lateral border of the hemi- sphere, or so drawn as to bisect the pre-occipital notch when this is evident. The sulci which occur on the convex surface may be described as two, though both of these are very variable in their extent and shape, and their branches are inconstant both as to number and length.

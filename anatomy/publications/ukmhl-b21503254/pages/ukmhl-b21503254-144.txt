872 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Cells of cortex of posterior part of frontal lobe give fibres to form frontal pontile path through frontal parts of corona radiata and internal capsule and through medial part of cerebral peduncle to nuclei of pons. Fig. 647.â€”Scheme of Descending Cerebrospinal Conduction Pathways. 3. Cells of cortex of temporal lobe (two upper gyri) give fibres to form temporal pontile path which passes under the lenticular nucleus into lower part of occipital portion of internal capsule and outer part of cerebral peduncle to nuclei of pons.

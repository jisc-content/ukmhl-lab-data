THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 794 In addition to the fibres having the origin and course described above, and which constitute the greater mass of the superior cerebellar peduncle, each peduncle is said to contain fibres which—(1) arise in the cerebellar cortex of the same and opposite sides of the mid-line, instead of from the dentate nucleus, and which join the peduncle at the side of the dentate nucleus, between it and the restiform body; (2) fibres which do not cross the mid-line in the decussation, but terminate in the red nucleus of the same side; (3) possibly some fibres are not interrupted in the red nucleus, but pass directly into the thalamus; (4) a small proportion of fibres afferent as to the cere- bellum, which arise in the structures of the cerebrum and pass in to the cerebellum; and (5) the greater part, if not all, of the ascending fibres of the antero-lateral superficial fasciculus (Gowers' tract) of the spinal cord. The latter, instead of entering the cerebellum by way of the restiform body, are deflected in the medulla Fig. 589.—Transparency Drawing Showing the Origin, Course, and Connections of the Superior Cerebellar Peduncles (Brachia Conjunctiva) in the Formation of ' Stilling's Scissors.' and pass in the lateral tegmentum of the pons to the anterior medullary velum, where they turn backwards to enter the cerebellum in its superior peduncle and pass to its cortex, probably from the outer side of the dentate nucleus (see fig. 605). The anatomy of the fourth ventricle.—The fourth ventricle is rhomboidal in shape, being considerably widened at the level of the brachia pontis and pointed at each end. Its floor consists of a slight depression in the brain-stem, the fossa rhom- boidea, and corresponds to the floor of the central canal. Its pointed inferior end, the calamus scriptorius, is directly continuous with the central canal, and its narrowed anterior end is continued into the aquseductus cerebri (Sylvii) of the mesencephalon, which is nothing more than a resumption of the tubular form of the canal. The entire cavity of the ventricle is lined with an epithelium which is continuous with the epithelium, or ependyma, of the central canal. The roof of the anterior portion of the fourth ventricle is nervous, consisting of a

783 THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA 6 mm., and which, upon removal of the pia mater, may be easily observed as bundles of fibres interdigitating obliquely across the mid-line. Not all the pyramidal fibres cross to the opposite side at this level in man, but a portion of those coursing in the lateral periphery of the medulla maintain their ventro-mesial position and continue directly into the spinal cord, to form there the ventral cerebro-spinal fasciculus or direct pyramidal tract. However, most of such fibres finally cross the mid-line during their course in the spinal cord. The exact proportion of the direct fibres is variable, but always the greater mass of each pyramid crosses to the opposite side at the level of the decussation of the pyramids, and descends the cord as the lateral Fig. 580.—Semi-diagrammatic Representation of the Ventral Aspect of the Rhomben- cephalon and Adjacent Portions of the Cerebrum.

Both of these pyramidal tracts are described in the discussion of the fasciculi of the cord. Each pyramid is bounded laterally by the antero-lateral sulcus, also contin- uous with that of the same name in the spinal cord. Towards the pons this sulcus separates the pyramid from the olive (inferior olivary nucleus), and in the region of the olive there emerge along this sulcus the root filaments of the hypoglossal nerve. These are in line with the filaments of the ventral roots of the spinal nerves. The olives, as their name implies, are oblong oval eminences about 1/2 cm. in length. They extend to the border of the pons, and are somewhat thicker at their upper ends. Their surfaces are usually smooth, except at their lower ends, where they frequently

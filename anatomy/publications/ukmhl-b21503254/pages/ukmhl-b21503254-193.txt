THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS 921 subscapular artery along the axillary margin of the subscapularis muscle, and ends in the latissimus dorsi (fig. 679). The lower subscapular nerve, carrying fibres from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves, passes behind the subscapular artery, below the circumflex branch (dorsalis scapula?), and is distributed to the teres major, and furnishes to the subscapularis one or two twigs which enter that muscle near its axillary margin. The terminal branches are two from each cord. The posterior cord divides into the axillary (circumflex) and the radial (musculo-spiral) nerves. The outer cord divides into the musculo-cutaneous nerve, and the outer root of the median nerve; the inner cord into the ulnar nerve, and the inner root of the median nerve. The Axillary (Circumflex) Nerve is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the posterior cord, and contains fibres from the fifth and sixth cervical nerves (figs. 675 Fig. 680. -Distribution of Cutaneous Nerves on the Anterior and Posterior Aspects of the Superior Extremity. posterior brachial cutaneous MEDIAL ANTI- BRACHIAL CUTANEOUS PALMAR CUTA- NEOUS OF MEDIAN PALMAR CUTA- NEOUS OF ULNAR SUPRA- ACR03IIAL AXILLARY INTERCOSTO- BRACHIAL TWIG OF MEDIAL A NTIBRA CIA L CUTANEOUS DORSAL ANTI- BRACHIAL CUTANEOUS MUSCULO- CUTANEOUS LATERAL ( BRACHIAL^ CUTANEOUS I SUPERFI- CIAL RADIAL DORSAL ANTI- BRA CHI A L CUTANEOUS MUSCULO- CUTANEOUS SUPERFICIAL RADIAL SUPRA- ACROMIAL POSTERIOR BRACHIAL CUTANEOUS INTERCOSTO- BRACHIAL MEDIAL BRACHIAL CUTANEOUS (NERVE OF WRISBERG) A NTI- BRA CHI A I, CUTANEOUS ULNAR and 678). At the lower border of the subscapularis it passes dorsalwards and accom- panies the posterior circumflex artery through the quadrilateral space, which is bounded by the teres major, long head of triceps, and subscapularis muscles, and the surgical neck of the humerus, and it divides into a smaller superior and a larger in- ferior division. Previous to its division it furnishes an articular twig to the shoulder- joint. This twig-pierces the inferior part of the articular capsule. . The superior division accompanies the posterior circumflex artery around the neck of the humerus, and gives off a number of stout twigs which enter the deltoid muscle (fig. 679). A few fine filaments pierce the deltoid and end in the integument which covers the middle third of that muscle. The inferior division divides into cutaneous and muscular branches. The cutaneous branch (the lateral brachial cutaneous nerve) turns around the posterior ' border of the deltoid, pierces the deep fascia, and supplies the skin covering the lower

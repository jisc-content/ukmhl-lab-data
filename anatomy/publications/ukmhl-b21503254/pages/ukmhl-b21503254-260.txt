988 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM and the internal carotid artery under cover of the parotid gland, the styloid muscles, and the posterior belly of the digastric, and it is crossed superficially by the poste- rior auricular and the occipital arteries. As it turns forwards around the root of the occipital artery the sterno-mastoid branch of that vessel hooks downwards across the nerve, and as it runs forwards on the hyo-glossus muscle it lies immediately above the ranine vein. It is crossed by the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscle, and it is covered superficially, behind the mylo-hyoid, by the lower part of the submaxillary gland. Communications.—The hypoglossus is connected with the first cervical gan- glion of the sympathetic, with the ganglion nodosum of the vagus, with the loop between the first and second cervical nerves, and with the lingual nerve; the latter communication is established along the anterior border of the hyo-glossus (figs. 706 and 707).

It passes backwards into the posterior fossa of the cranium and is distributed to the dura mater. It was believed at one time that the fibres of the meningeal branch were derived from the lingual nerve, but it is now deemed more probable that they are fibres from the cervical nerves, the sympathetic, or the vagus. (2) Branches which consist of Fibres derived from the Cervical Plexus.— The descendens hypoglossi and the muscular twig to the thyreo-hyoid muscle, though apparently arising from the twelfth nerve, consist entirely of fibres which have passed into the hypoglossal nerve from the loop between the first two cervical nerves. (a) The descendens hypoglossi parts company with the hypoglossus at the point where the latter hooks around the occipital artery (fig. 707). It runs downwards and slightly inwards on the sheath of the great vessels (occasionally within the sheath), and is joined at a variable level by branches from the second and third

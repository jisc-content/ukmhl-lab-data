917 THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS The brachial plexus (figs. 675, 678, 679) is formed by the anterior primary divisions of the four lower cervical nerves and the greater part of the first thoracic nerve. It is usually joined by small communicating twigs from the fourth cervical and second thoracic nerves. The anterior primary divisions of the lower four cervical nerves, after crossing behind the vertebral artery and between the anterior and posterior parts of the inter- transverse muscles, pass into the posterior triangle in the interval between the adjacent borders of the anterior and middle scalene muscles, where the fifth and sixth nerves receive a grey ramus communicans each from the middle cervical sympathetic ganglion, and the seventh and eighth nerves each receive a grey ramus from the inferior cervical sympathetic ganglion. The first thoracic is connected by two rami communicantes with the first thoracic sympathetic ganglion, and it divides into a smaller and a larger branch. The smaller branch passes along the intercostal space as the intercostal nerve, and the larger branch, after being joined by a communication from the second Fig. 678.—Diagram of a Common Form of Brachial Plexus. The posterior cord of the plexus is darkly shaded.

It is on account of this variation in the point of union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves and of the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves that so many different forms of the plexus have been pictured and described. But if the differences in pri- mary branching be borne in mind, the formation of the plexus is always uniform and simple, notwithstanding its different appearances. The three cords are formed from these branches in the following manner:—(1) The outer cord is formed by the anterior branches of the fifth, sixth, and seventh nerves; (2) the inner cord, by the anterior branches of the eighth cervical and first

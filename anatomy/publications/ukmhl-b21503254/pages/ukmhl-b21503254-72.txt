THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 800 lemniscus, distinguished in transverse sections of the superior pons and mesen- cephalic regions of the brain-stem (fig. 609). The reticular formation of the medulla and pons region is considerably more abundant than in the spinal cord. As in the spinal cord, it consists of grey substance through which nerve-fibres, singly and in small bundles, course in all directions, and more sparsely than in other regions. In the medulla it is traversed by the in- ternal arcuate fibres. It may be considered an enlarged continuation of the middle portion of the grey column of the cord, traversed by numerous fibres, giving it the reticulated appearance which suggests its name. Its numerous nerve-cells belong, for the most part, to the association and commissural systems of the brain-stem, and, therefore, the fibres arising in it correspond to the fasciculi proprii of the spinal cord. As in the cord, most of the fibres are of short course, serving to associate different portions of the same level and adjacent levels with each other. Those of long course show a tendency to collect into a small, well-marked bundle which courses one on each side close to the mid-line, ventral to the central canal in the closed part of the medulla, and near the floor of the fourth ventricle, in the open part. In the mesencephalon this bundle is again situated ventral to the aquseductus cerebri.

RAPHE PYRAMID This bundle is known as the medial longitudinal fasciculus (posterior longi- - tudinal bundle). It corresponds more nearly to the ventral fasciculus proprius of the spinal cord than to others of the fasciculi proprii. In the medulla it appears as the dorsal edge of the lemniscus, but in the shifting of the position of the lemniscus in the pons region, it becomes isolated. By position it is especially adapted for the association of the nuclei of the cranial nerves. Evidence has been found that those fibres which arise in the corpora quadrigemina and descend the spinal cord in its sulco-marginal fasciculus, pass through the medulla in the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The inferior olivary nucleus is an added structure in the medulla oblongata, i. e., it has no homologue in the spinal cord. The two of them occupy the olivary prominences, the olives of the exterior, and constitute the most conspicuous and striking isolated masses of grey substance in sections of the medulla. The)' appear as crenated lamina; of grey substance folded so as to encup a dense mass of white substance, and in actual shape the entire nucleus has the form of an irregular corru- gated cup with the opening or hilus on the side towards the mid-line. The mass is so crumpled that the diameter of the hilus is appreciably less than the length of the nucleus, and thus transverse sections of either extremity of it appear as closed cap- sules.

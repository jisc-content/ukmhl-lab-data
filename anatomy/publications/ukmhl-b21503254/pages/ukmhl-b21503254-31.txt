759 THE SPINAL CORD enlargement. The spinal nerves attached to these regions are of greater size than in other regions. The cervical enlargement begins with the third cervical vertebra, acquires its greatest breadth (12 to 14 mm.) opposite the lower part of the fifth cervical vertebra (origin of the sixth cervical nerves), and extends to opposite the second thoracic vertebra. Unlike the lumbar enlargement, its lateral is noticeably greater than its dorso-ventral diameter.

The lumbar enlargement begins gradually with the ninth or tenth thoracic ver- tebra, is most marked at the twelfth thoracic vertebra (origin of the fourth lumbar nerves), and rapidly diminishes into the conus medullaris. Both the lumbar and thoracic regions are practically circular in transverse sec- tion. Neither diameter of the lumbar is ever so great as the lateral diameter of the cervical enlargement. The thoracic part attains its smallest diameter opposite

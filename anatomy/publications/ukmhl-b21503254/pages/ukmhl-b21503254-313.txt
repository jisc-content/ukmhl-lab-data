1041 THE OPTIC NERVE work separating the bundles of nerve-fibres; between the enclosed nerve-fibres and each mesh of this framework there is a narrow interval occupied by lymph. The nerve-fibres are medullated, but have no primitive sheath. About fifteen or twenty millimetres behind the globe the central vessels enter, piercing obliquely the lower outer quadrant of the nerve, and then run forwards in its axis. They are accompanied throughout by a special process of the pial sheath, which forms a fibrous cord in the centre of the nerve. On reaching the eyeball, the dural sheath is joined by the arachnoid, and turns away from the nerve to be continued into the outer two-thirds of the sclerotic. Similarly the pial sheath also here leaves the nerve, its greater part running into the inner third of the sclerotic, while a few of its fibres join the chorioid; the inter- Fig. 740.—Longitudinal Section through Termination of Optic Nerve.

In this locality the connective-tissue framework of the nerve becomes thicker and closer in its meshwork, and has been already alluded to as the lamina cribrosa. It is formed by processes passing out from the central fibrous cord at its termination and by processes passing inwards from the pial sheath, sclerotic, and chorioid. It does not pass straight across the nerve, but follows the curve of the surrounding sclerotic, 66

DISTRIBUTION OF THE CUTANEOUS NERVES 991 The Cutaneous Areas of the Pinna The upper two-thirds of the outer surface of the pinna are supplied by the auriculo- temporal branch of the third division of the trigeminus, and the lower third by twigs of the great auricular nerve. The lower three-fourths of the cranial surface of the pinna are supplied by the great auricular nerve, and the upper fourth by the small occipital nerve. The posterior surface of the external auditory meatus receives fila- ments from the auricular branch of the vagus. The Cutaneous Areas of the Neck The skin over the anterior part of the neck is supplied by the superficial cervical branch of the cervical plexus, which contains filaments of the second and third cervical nerves, and, in the lower part of its extent, by the anterior supra-clavicular nerves (suprasternal branches) which convey twigs of the third and fourth cervical Fig 709.â€”Diagram of the Cutaneous Areas of the Side of the Body and Part of .the Limb. (After Head.) nerves (fig. 708). The lateral part of the neck receives filaments from the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves by way of the great auricular, small occipital, and middle supraclavicular (supra-clavicular) branches of the cervical plexus, and posteriorly the skin of the neck is supplied by the small occipital nerve and by the internal branches of the posterior primary divisions of the cervical nerves from the second to the sixth inclusive (fig. 710). The Cutaneous Areas of the Trunk The skin over the ventral aspect of the trunk as far down as the third rib is supplied by the anterior supra-clavicular (suprasternal) and middle supra-clavicular (supra-clavicular) branches of the cervical plexus, which contain filaments from the third and fourth cervical nerves (fig. 710). From the third rib to the lower part of the abdominal wall it receives the anterior cutaneous branches, and the anterior divisions

848 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM mid-line, to fuse with the like bundle from the hippocampal gyri of the opposite side. The bundles thus arising from the two sides are the posterior pillars or crura of the fornix. They appear as two flattened bands of white substance which come in close contact with and even adhere to the splenium. The angle formed by the mutual approach of the posterior pillars of the fornix is crossed by a lamina of commissural fibres connecting the hippocampal gyri of the two hemispheres (fig. 631). This lamina is the hippocampal commissure (psalterium or lyra), and being of a different functional direction, should not be considered a HIPPOCAMPUS MAJOR Fig. 629.—Diagram showing Fornix and its Connections as seen from Above. olfactory bulb medial olfactor SUBCALLOSAL Gl ANTERIOR COL DIG IT A TIONS {PES) OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS FIMBRIA 77 D I ZhS I fill \YA 1 G\ I AMYGDALOID NUCLEUS THALA MO-MAMMILLA R Y FASCICULUS STRIA TERMINALLY OF THALAMUS STRIA MEDULLAR IS OF THALAMUS POSTERIOR PILLAR EPIPHYSIS HIPPOCAMPAL COMMISSURE (LYRA) part of the fornix. Usually the hippocampal commissure and the posterior crura are in close contact with the under surface of the splenium. When occasionally they do not adhere, the space between is known as Verga's ventricle. The body of the fornix appears as a triangular plate of white substance produced by the fusion of the pillars. Its base or widest portion is behind. It is not always bilaterally symmetrical. Its upper surface is attached by the septum pellucidum to the under surface of the corpus callosum. Below, it lies over the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle, which separates it mesially from the cavity of the third ventricle Fig. 630.—Diagram of Course of Fornix as viewed from the Side.

Its sharp lateral edge or mar- gin (taenia fornicis) projects into the lateral ventricle of either side in relation with the chorioid plexus of that ventricle, and thus the lateral portion of its upper surface forms part of the floor of the lateral ventricle—an arrangement to be expected, since the posterior pillars arise from the floor of the ventricle, viz., the hippocampus. The ventricular portion is covered by a layer of ependyma in common with that lining the rest of the ventricle.

ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE 1038 connected with the dural sheath of the optic nerve. As it covers the inferior or- bital (spheno-maxillary) fissure its fibres are interwoven with smooth muscle, forming the orbital muscle of Miiller. From its inner surface processes run into the orbital cavity, separating the fat lobules. One important process comes from the periorbita about midway along the roof of the orbit, runs forwards to the back of the upper division of the lachrymal gland, and there splits, helping to form the gland-capsule: this capsule is joined at its inner border by other periorbital bands coming off near the upper orbital rim, and forming the suspensory ligament of the gland. On the inner side of the orbit the periorbita sends fibrous processes to the trochlea of the superior oblique, which keep it in position. On arriving at the lachrymal groove the periorbita divides into two layers, a thin posterior one continuing to line the bone forming the floor of the groove, whilst the thicker anterior layer bridges over the groove and the sac which lies in it, forming the limbs of the inner palpebral ligament (page 1046).

The orbital muscles are connected by a common fascia, which splits at their borders and furnishes a sheath to each. Processes of this fascia give membranous investments for the vessels and nerves (including the optic nerve), splitting similarly to enclose them; these membranous processes also assist in separating the fat lob- ules. Posteriorly, this fascia is thin and loose, and blends with the periorbita at the origin of the muscles. Anteriorly, it becomes thicker and firmer, accompanies the muscles to near the equator of the eyeball, and there divides into two laminae, an anterior and a posterior; the former continues a forward course, forming a complete funnel-shaped investment all around, passing ultimately to the eyelids and

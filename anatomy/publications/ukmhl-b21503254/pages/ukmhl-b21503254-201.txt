THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS 929 obliquely across the long flexor tendon of the thumb and runs along the radial border of the thumb to its extremity. It gives numerous branches to the pulp of the thumb, and a strong twig which passes to the dorsum to supply the matrix of the nail. The second of these proper volar digitals supplies the ulnar side of the volar aspect of the thumb and gives off a twig to the matrix of the thumb nail. The third supplies the radial side of the second digit and gives a twig to the first lumbrical muscle. The second common volar digital sends a twig to the second lumbrical muscle, and divides a little above the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation into two proper Fig. 684.â€”Nerves of the Palmar Surface of the Hand. (Testut.) The transverse carpal (anterior annular) ligament, superficial palmar arch, the flexor tendons of the digits, and the proximal portions of the lumbrical muscles have been removed. 8, 9, Digitals of second and third common volar; 11, branch to lumbrical II; 16, anastomotic branch between ulnar and median nerves; 20, branch to lumbrical III; 22, branch to interossei.

The third common volar digital communicates with the ulnar nerve, often gives a branch to the third lumbrical muscle, and divides into two proper volar digitals which supply the adjacent sides of the third and fourth digits. As the proper volar digitals pass along the margins of the fingers they give off twigs for the innervation of the skin on the dorsum of the second and third phalanges and the matrix of their nails. Each of the nerves terminates in filaments to the pulp of the finger. 59

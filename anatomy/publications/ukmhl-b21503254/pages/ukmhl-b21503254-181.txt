POSTERIOR DIVISIONS OF SPINAL NERVES 909 The lateral branches of the upper six thoracic nerves pass between the longis- simus dorsi and the ilio-costalis dorsi (accessorius) and end in those muscles, but the lateral branches of the six lower nerves are longer; they pass into the interval between the longissimus dorsi and the ilio-costalis dorsi and give branches to them, and then they pierce the latissimus dorsi and are distributed to the skin of the lower and lateral part of the back.

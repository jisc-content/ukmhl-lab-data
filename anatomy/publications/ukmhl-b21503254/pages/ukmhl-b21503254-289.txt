1017 THE HYPOGASTRIC PLEXUS panies the corresponding hypogastric (internal iliac) artery, and gives off secondary plexuses that continue on the branches of the artery to the pelvic viscera. Of these secondary plexuses, the middle hsemorrhoidal and the vesical plexus are common to both sexes and are paired. The middle hasmorrhoidal plexus passes on each side along the middle hsemor- rhoidal artery to the rectum, where it receives the superior hsemorrhoidal nerves and sends filaments into the wall of the rectum (fig. 722).

Each part passes along the corresponding vesical arteries to the blad- der, and gives off two sets of branches, namely, the superior vesical nerves (fig. 722), which supply the upper part of the bladder-wall and send some branches to the ureter,

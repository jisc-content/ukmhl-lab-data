NUCLEI OF THE CRANIAL NERVES 807 cells of the superior olivary nucleus of the same and opposite sides. The superior olive is a small accumulation of grey substance which lies in the level of the posterior portion of the pons, and in line with the much larger inferior olivary nucleus of the medulla. However, it is not analogous to the latter in any sense. The two superior olives form links in the central acoustic chain. From cells of the superior olivary nucleus of the same and opposite sides, fibres arise which pass by way of the lateral lemniscus and terminate in the grey substance of the inferior quadrigeminate body and in the medial geniculate body, thus connecting these bodies with the ventral nucleus of the cochlear nerve of the opposite side. From the medial geniculate body fibres arise which pass to the cortex of the superior gyrus of the temporal lobe. This path is supplemented by fibres arising in the inferior quadrigeminate body, which likewise go to the temporal lobe. In the lateral lemniscus some of the acoustic fibres are interrupted by cells of the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. In crossing the mid- line the fibres from the two sources form a more or less compact bundle, the corpus Fig. 601.—Scheme showing Some of the Central Connections of the Acoustic Nerve.

To this are added fibres crossing between the nuclei trapezoidei, smaller masses of grey substance just ventral to the superior olives. Also, some fibres arising in the nuclei of termination of the cochlear nerve pass to the inferior quadrigeminate body of the same side. On the other hand, the con- nection with the medial geniculate body is thought to be wholly a crossed one. Further, a few fibres are described as terminating in the superior quadrigeminate body of both the same and the opposite side. All the fibres arising in the superior olivary nucleus do not enter the corpus trapezoideum and the lateral lemniscus. A small bundle, the peduncle of the superior olive, arises in each nucleus and courses dorsally to the region of the nucleus of the abducens. Here certain of its fibres terminate about the cells of the nucleus of the abducens, while others enter the medial longitudinal fasciculus and pass to the nuclei of the trochlear and oculomotor nerves, thus establishing connections between auditory impulses and eye movements.

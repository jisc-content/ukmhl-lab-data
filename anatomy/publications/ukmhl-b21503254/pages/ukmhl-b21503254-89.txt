817 THE MESENCEPHALON of the trigeminus, it increases slightly in size, due to the progressive addition of fibres. Its nucleus also increases slightly in bulk in approaching the region of the principal motor nucleus of the trigeminus. The sensory nucleus (nucleus of termination) of the trigeminus probably does not extend appreciably into the mesencephalon. The nuclei of the trochlear and oculomotor nerves form a practically continuous column of nerve-cells extending close to the mid-line and ventral to the aquseductus cerebri. They are in line with the nuclei of origin of the abducens and hypoglossus, and, like them, may be regarded as an upward continuation of the ventral group of the cells of the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The portion of the column giving origin to the oculomotor nerve is considerably larger than that of the trochlear. A transverse section through the inferior quadrigeminate bodies involves a por- tion of the decussation of the brachia conjunctiva and the nuclei of origin of the trochlear nerves, while a transverse section through the superior quadrigeminate Fig. 609.—Transverse Section Through the Inferior Quadrigeminate Bodies.

The latter section will also involve the brachia of the inferior quadrigeminate bodies and the medial geniculate bodies connected with them. The trochlear or fourth nerve is the smallest of the cranial nerves, and is the only one which makes its exit from the dorsal surface of the brain, as well as the only one whose fibres undergo a total decussation. Its nucleus of origin is situated be- neath the inferior quadrigeminate bodies in the ventral margin of the central grey substance, quite close to the micl-line and to its fellow nucleus of the opposite side, and it is closely associated with the dorso-mesial margin of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Its fibres pass outwards and dorsalwards, curving around the margin of the central grey substance, mesial to the mesencephalic root of the trigeminus. As the root curves towards the mid-line in the dorsal region just beneath the inferior quadrigeminate bodies, it turns sharply and courses inferiorly to approach the surface 52

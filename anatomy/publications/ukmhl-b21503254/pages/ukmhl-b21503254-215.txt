THE LUMBOSACRAL TRUNK 943 plied by the superficial branch. The branch to the obturator externus is given off in the obturator canal. 2. An articular branch to the knee-joint which appears in some cases to be the continuation of the trunk of the posterior branch (fig. 690). It either pierces the lower part of the adductor magnus, or it passes through the opening for the femoral artery. In the popliteal space it descends on the popliteal artery to the back of the joint, where it pierces the posterior ligament, and its terminal filaments are distributed to the crucial ligaments and the structures in their immediate neigh- bourhood. This branch is not uncommonly absent. Occasionally the posterior branch of the obturator nerve also supplies a twig to the hip-joint. The Accessory Obturator Nerve arises from the third or fourth or from the third and fourth lumbar nerves, in the angles between the roots of the femoral (anterior crural) and obturator nerves. It is present in about ten per cent, of the cases examined. It is often closely associated with the obturator nerve to the level of the Fig. 691.â€”Distribution op Cutaneous Nerves on the Posterior and Anterior Aspects of the Inferior Extremity. last THORACIC ILIO-HYPO- GASTRIC LATERAL CUTANEOUS POSTERIOR CUTANEOUS LATERAL CUTANEOUS ANASTOMOTIC BRANCH OF PERONEAL SURAL SUPERIOR CLUNIAL MIDDLE CLUNIAL INFERIOR MEDIAL CLUNIAL LONG PUDENDAL BRANCHES OF POSTERIOR ' CUTANEOUS OBTURATOR ANTERIOR CUTANEOUS MEDIAL SURAL CUTANEOUS ILIO- ING UINAL ANTERIOR CUTANEOUS ANTERIOR (INTERNAL) CUTANEOUS INFRA- PATELLAR BRANCH OF SAPHE- NOUS SAPHENOUS TWIGS FROM SAPHENOUS MEDIAL CALCANEAL BRANCHES OF TIBIAL DEEP PERONEAL LATERAL CUTANEO US GENITO- FEMORAL ANTERIOR (MIDDLE) CUTANEOUS ANASTO- MOTIC BRANCH OF PERONEAL SUPER- FICIAL PERONEAL LATERAL DORSAL CUTANEO US brim of the pelvis, but instead of passing through the obturator foramen', it descends along the inner border of the psoas, crosses the anterior part of the brim of the pelvis, passes beneath the pectineus, and terminates in three main branches. One of these branches joins the anterior division of the obturator nerve, another supplies the pectineus, and the third is distributed to the hip-joint. The Lumbosacral Trunk The trunk usually formed by the union of the smaller part of the fourth and the entire fifth lumbar nerves is called the lumbo-sacral trunk (figs. 688, 693). Some- times the larger part of the fourth nerve may help to form the trunk. It may re-

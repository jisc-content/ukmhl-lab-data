914 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM mastoid, auricular, and facial. As the nerve ascends obliquely across the sterno- mastoid it is embedded in the deep cervical fascia, is covered by superficial fascia and the platysma, and it lies parallel with and slightly behind the external jugular vein, (a) The mastoid branch is small, and is distributed to the integument cover- ing the mastoid process. It anastomoses with the posterior auricular and small occipital nerves, (b) The auricular branches are three or four stout twigs which anastomose with the branches of the posterior auricular nerve; they cross the super- ficial surface of the posterior auricular branch of the facial, and are distributed to the skin on the back of the pinna with the exception of its uppermost part. One or two twigs pass through fissures in the cartilage of the pinna, and are distributed to Fig. 677.—Superficial Branches of the Cervical Plexus After Hirsehfeld and Leveille.)

(c) The facial branches pass upwards and forwards among the superficial lobules of the parotid gland, and supply the skin over that gland and immediately in front of it, and they anastomose in the substance of the gland with the cervico-facial division of the facial nerve. In some cases fine twigs may be traced forwards nearly to the angle of the mouth. Transverse branch.—The Superficial Cervical Cutaneous Nerve (transverse cervical) arises from the second and third cervical nerves (figs. 675, 676), and appears at the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, a little below the great auric- ular nerve. It passes transversely across the sterno-mastoid under cover of the integ- ument, platysma, and external jugular vein, and divides into a number of twigs which

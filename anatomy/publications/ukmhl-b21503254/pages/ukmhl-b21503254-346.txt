1074 ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE (nasal) branch of the ophthalmic nerve; the Vidian nerve; the posterior superior and posterior inferior nasal and the anterior palatine from the spheno-palatine ganglion (p. 972); the anterior superior alveolar from the infra-orbital division of the maxillary nerve (p. 968). The development of the nose.â€”The nasal cavity makes its appearance as a depression of the ectoderm on either side of the median line, immediately in front of the oval fossa, with which the depressions are at first continuous. Later, by the union of the maxillary and globular proc- esses (see p. 1076), the depressions are separated from the anterior part of the oral fossa, and this separation is continued by the formation of the palatal processes of the maxilla? and palatine bones, so that finally the nasal cavities communicate posteriorly only with the pharynx. The cartilage which forms the lateral walls of the nasal fossa? is at first quite smooth, but later it becomes eroded by absorption, whereby the nasal concha? are formed. The erosion also extends into the neighbouring bones, the frontal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses, and the ethmoidal cells, being formed in this manner, and being, accordingly, lined by mucous membrane continuous with that of the nasal cavities.

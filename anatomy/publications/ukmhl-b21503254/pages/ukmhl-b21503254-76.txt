804 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM or accessory part of the nerve; those which arise from the ventral horn cells below are described as the spinal part. The trunk of the spinal accessory fuses with the vagus in the region of its two ganglia, and, before separation, contributes fibres (the accessory part) to the trunk of the vagus. The accessory fibres are distributed as motor fibres to the muscles of the larynx; the spinal part is distributed to the sterno- Fig. 599.â€”Scheme showing the Relative Size and Position of the Nuclei of Origin (Red) of the Motor and the Nuclei of Termination (Blue) of the Sensory Cranial Nerves.

The nucleus of the spinal accessory receives terminal twigs of pyramidal fibres and is otherwise subjected to influences similar to those affecting the cells giving origin to the motor roots of the spinal nerves. The vagus or pneumogastric and the glosso-pharyngeus, though they have widely different peripheral distributions, are so similar in origin and central connec-

School of medicine the SPINAL COBkNiVERSiTY OF LlE®S. Some of the axones of the dorsal fasciculus proprius cross the mid-line to distribute impulses to the neurones of the opposite side. These commissural axones, together with certain collaterals of the dorsal root axones, which cross the mid-line outside the dorsal white commissure, compose the so-called cornu-commissural tract at the base of the posterior septum. The lateral funiculus or column.—Not all the axones of the posterior or dorsal nerve-roots extend to the encephalon. Estimation shows that the sum of all the dorsal roots is greatly in excess of the sum contained in the fasciculi cuneatus and gracilis just before these enter their nuclei of termination. Therefore many of the ascending dorsal root axones are concerned with spinal-cord connections wholly. The marginal zone of Lissauer, situated along the lateral margin of the postero- lateral sulcus, is composed largely of dorsal root axones. Many of these finally work across the line of the sulcus into the posterior column. Many of the dorsal root-fibres which do not reach the brain occur in Lissauer's zone. Many others, of course, occur throughout the posterior column. Lissauer's zone also contains some fibres arising from the small cells of the dorsal horn, and to this extent corresponds to a fasciculus proprius.

Beyond that it probably does not contain commissural axones, it is of the same general significance as the others. It is frequently divided into small bundles by the reticular formation. The lateral cerebro-spinal fasciculus (crossed pyramidal tract). In contrast to the sensory fibres passing through the spinal cord to the cerebral cortex, axones are given off from the pyramidal cells of the cortex, which descend to terminate about the cells of the grey substance of the spinal cord, chiefly the cells which give origin to the ventral root-fibres. Upon reaching the medulla oblongata in their descent, these axones are accumulated into two well-defined, ventrally placed bun- dles, the pyramids, one from each cerebral hemisphere. In passing through the brain stem the pyramids contribute many fibres to the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, and thus decrease appreciably in bulk. According to the estimate of Thompson, about 160,000 of the pyramidal fibres are destined to enter the spinal cord. Upon reaching the lower part of the medulla,'the greater mass of the fibres of each pyramid, which are destined to enter the cord, suddenly cross the mid-line in the 'decussation of the pyramids.' The remainder retain their ventral position in

755 DEVELOPMENT OF NERVOUS SYSTEM with the fourth or posterior ventricle passes under the corpora quadrigemina and is known as the aqueduct of Sylvius, or aquaeductus cerebri. The localised thickening of the wall of the neural canal results from the combined prolifer- ation and migration of its component cells. These proliferating cells have been called germinal Fig. 561.—Diagrammatic Horizontal Section of a Vertebrate Brain. (After Huxley.)

The products of their division are apparently indifferent at first, but later they become differentiated into two varieties:—(1) Spongioblasts, or those cells which will develope into neu- roglia, and (2) neuroblasts, or those cells which will develope into neurones. The neuroblasts Fig. 562.—Diagram showing the Segments and the Flexures of the Human Brain and the Expansion of the Cerebral Hemispheres over the Other Portions of the Brain.

Neurones whose cell-bodies belong to the peripheral nervous system are not developed within the walls of the central system at all.

The wedge-shaped mass comprising the neural crest, through the proliferation of its cells, gradually extends outwards over the surface of the neural tube along either side. Soon the proliferation becomes

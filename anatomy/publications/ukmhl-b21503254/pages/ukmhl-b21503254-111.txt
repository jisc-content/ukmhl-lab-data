839 THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES is so constant that it serves as a means by which either of the sulci may be identified. The marginal portion separates the paracentral lobule from the precuneus (quadrate lobule), and is wholly within the parietal lobe. One of the most constant twigs of the sulcus cinguli is that which marks off the paracentral lobule from the superior frontal gyrus. Another sometimes divides the paracentral lobule into its frontal and parietal portions. The sulcus cinguli is developed from two and sometimes three (anterior, middle, and posterior) separate furrows, which later extend and fuse into continuity. This method of its development may explain the irregularities fre- quently met with and the fact that sometimes in the adult the sulcus occurs in separate pieces. The central sulcus (fissure of Rolando) is one of the principal landmarks of the convex surface of the hemisphere. It separates the frontal from the parietal lobe, Fig. 624.—Basal Surface of the Cerebral Hemispheres. (After Toldt, "Atlas of Human Anatomy," Rebman, London and New York.)

Its upper end terminates in and usually cuts the supero-mesial border of the hemisphere immediately in front of the termination of the marginal portion of the sulcus cinguli. Thence it pursues an oblique though sinuous course forwards across the convex surface of the hemi- sphere, forming on the average an angle of about 72° with the supero-mesial border (Rolandic angle), and terminates in the fronto-parietal operculum immediately above the posterior ramus, and about 2-5 cm. behind the point of origin of the an- terior rami of the lateral fissure. It rarely cuts through the fronto-parietal oper- culum. In its sinuous course, two bends are most marked:—(1) The superior genu occurs at about the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the sulcus and is con- cave forwards. It accommodates the greater part of that portion of the cortex

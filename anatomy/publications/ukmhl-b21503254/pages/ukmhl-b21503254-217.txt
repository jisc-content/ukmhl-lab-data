School of Medicine THE SACRAL PLE^M^SITY OF Ll^PS It is also behind the coils of intestine, the lower part of the ilio-pelvic colon lying in front of the left plexus, and the lower part of the ileum in front of the right plexus. The branches given off by this plexus are:—collateral, visceral, cutaneous, and muscular. The collateral branches are visceral, muscular, and cutaneous offsets. Visceral Branches are given off from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves to the pelvic viscera. Both the collateral and visceral branches of the plexus are relatively small and are seldom given special names. Fig. 692.—Lumbo-sacral Plexus.

It lies on the back of the plexus (figs. 692, 693), leaves the pelvis at the lower border of the pirifor- mis, and descends in the buttock between the gluteus maximus and the posterior surface of the sciatic nerve (fig. 694). At the lower border of the gluteus maximus it passes behind the long head of the biceps femoris, and descends, immediately be- neath the deep fascia, through the thigh and the upper part of the popliteal space 60

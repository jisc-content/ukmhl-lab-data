990 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM nose is supplied medially by the supratrochlear, the infratrochlear, and the nasal branches of the first division, and laterally by the infra-orbital branch of the second division. The upper eyelid is supplied by the supratrochlear, the supra-orbital, and the lachrymal branches of the first division; the lower eyelid by the infra- trochlear branch of the first division and by the infra-orbital and the zygomatico- facial (malar) branches of the second division. The skin over the upper jaw and the Fig. 708.—Diagram of the Cutaneous Nerve Areas of the Head and Neck. Red—First division of trigeminus. White—Second division of trigeminus. Blue—Third division of trigeminus. Dark shading—Posterior primary divisions of cervical nerves. Oblique shading—Ascending and transverse superficial branches of cervical plexus. Transverse shading—Descending superficial branches of cervical plexus. It must be remembered that the boundaries of each area are not distinct; wherever two areas meet they overlap. zygomatic (malar) bone is supplied by the infra-orbital and zygomatico-facial branches of the second division, that over the buccinator by the buccal branch of the third division, and that over the lower jaw, from before backwards, by the mental, buccal, and auriculo-temporal branches of the third division, except a small part near the posterior border which receives its supply from the great auricular nerve.

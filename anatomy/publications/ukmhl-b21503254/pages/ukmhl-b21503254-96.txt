THE NERVOUS SYSTEM S24 epiphysis with the posterior commissure below it and the habenular trigone on its either side. The thalami are two ovoid, couch-like masses of grey substance which form the lateral walls of the third ventricle. The cavity of the ventricle is narrow, and quite frequently the thalami are continuous through it across the mid-line by a small but variable neck of grey substance, the massa intermedia or middle commis- sure. The upper surfaces of the thalami are free. The edges of the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle are attached to the lateral part of the surface of each thalamus, and, when removed, leave the taenia chorioidea lying in the chorioidal sulcus. Each thalamus is separated laterally from the caudate nucleus of the telencephalon, by a linear continuation of the white substance below, known as the stria terminalis Fig. 613.—Dorsal Surface of Diencephalon with Adjacent Structures.

Like the quadrigemina, each thalamus is covered by a thin capsule of white substance, the stratum zonale. The average length of the thala- mus is about 38 mm.,and its width about 14 mm.; its inferior extremity is directed obliquely outwards. The dorsal surface usually shows four eminences, indicating the position of the so-called nuclei of the thalamus. These are the anterior nucleus or anterior tubercle, the medial nucleus or tubercle, the lateral nucleus, and the pul- vinar, the tubercle of the posterior extremity. The pulvinar of the human brain is peculiar in the fact that it is so developed as to project inferiorly and slightly over- hang the level of the quadrigeminate bodies. The projecting portion assumes relations with the optic tract and the metathalamus.

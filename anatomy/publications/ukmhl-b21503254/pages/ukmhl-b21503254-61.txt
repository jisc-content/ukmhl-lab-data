THE CEREBELLUM 789 of the posterior notch begins, and here the horizontal and the posterior semilunar fissures approach each other so closely that the corresponding subdivision of the vermis is seldom more than a single folium, the folium vermis (cacuminis). The monticulus proper is divided into an inferior lobule, the clivus, and a superior lobule, the culmen. These appear as continuations across the mid-line of the pos- terior and anterior crescentic lobes of the hemispheres, and are separated by the corresponding fissures. At the extreme anterior part of the dorsal surface and in the bottom of the an- terior cerebellar notch lies a more definitely defined portion of the vermis. This is the central lobule (lobe). It is broadened laterally into two pointed wings, the ales of the central lobule, the folia of which, if present, are parallel with those of the anterior semilunar lobes. If the anterior margin of the central lobule be lifted, the lingula cerebelli {lin- gula vermis) will appear. It is a thin, tongue-like anterior projection of the cor- Fig. 585.—Median Section Through Cerebellum and Brain-stem.

Ventral surface.—The three cerebellar peduncles of each side join to form a single mass of white substance, and enter the ventral aspect of each hemisphere at the inner and ventral extremity of the horizontal fissure. The ventral and inferior surface of the cerebellum is less convex than the dorsal surface. The hemispheres are decidedly separated by a continuation of the posterior cerebellar notch, which becomes broader and contains the inferior portion of the vermis, vermis inferior, and whose margins embrace the medulla oblongata. The ventral surfaces of the hemispheres are each divided by the intervening fissures into four lobes. Below, the inferior semilunar lobe (postero-inferior lobe) is separated from the superior semilunar lobe of the dorsal surface by the horizontal fissure. It is the largest of the ventral lobes, and is broader at its medial extremity. Frequently two and sometimes three of its curved sulci appear deeper than others, and separate it into two or three slender lobules, lobuli graciles. More commonly there are two of these, the lobulus gracilis posterior and lobulus gracilis anterior, separated by sulci (fissures) correspondingly named.

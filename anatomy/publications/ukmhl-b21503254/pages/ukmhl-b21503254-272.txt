1000 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM different distances away from the vertebral column-—(1) A large portion of the cells remain near the central system and form a linear series of ganglia which, with the trunks connecting them, become two gangliated nerve-cords extending along each side, proximal to and parallel with the vertebral column; (2) a still larger portion of the cells migrate further towards the periphery and are accumulated into ganglia which assume an intermediate position and which, with the rami connecting them with each other and with other structures, form a series of great ■prevertebral plexuses; (3) still other cells wander even further away from the locality of their origin and invade the very walls of the organs innervated by the sympathetic system. The latter cells occur as numerous small terminal ganglia, most of which are microscopic and which, with the twigs connecting them, form the most peripheral of the sympathetic plexuses. Examples of these are the intrinsic ganglia of the heart and pancreas and the plexuses of Auerbach and Meissner in the walls of the digestive canal. Small, straggling ganglia may be found scattered between these three general groups. The supporting tissue of the sympathetic system accumulates early and is probably all of mesodermic origin. Construction of the sympathetic system.—The sympathetic ganglia may be considered as relays in the pathways for the transmission of impulses from the region in which they arise to the tissues in which they are distributed; the cells composing the ganglia are the cell-bodies of the neurones interposed in the various neurone chains performing this function. A fibre arising from a cell-body in a given ganglion may pass out of the ganglion and proceed directly to its termination upon a smooth muscle-fibre or gland-cell, or it may pass through a connecting trunk to another ganglion and there terminate about and thus transmit the impulse to another cell, which, in its turn, may give off the fibre which bears the impulse to the appropriate tissue-element. Fibres arising in given ganglia .may pass through other ganglia and proceed uninterrupted to their respective destinations. On the other hand, several

STRUCTURE OF THE PONS 811 the medulla oblongata immediately below, exclusive of the pyramids. In addition, this region contains the superior olivary nucleus and the corpus trapezoideum. The significance of these structures and their relation to the nucleus of termination of the Fig. 603.—Diagram of Transverse Section op Inferior Part of Pons. (Schwalbe.) The restiform body, not included, occupies the curved space lateral to the nucleus of vestibular nerve. LA TERAL NUCLEUS OF GENU OF FACIAL NERVE NUCLEUS OF ABDUCENS VESTIBULAR NERVE cochlear nerve is shown in fig. 601. In this region the lemniscus (fillet) changes from the vertical to the horizontal arrangement, and its lateral edges are becoming drawn outwards to form the lateral lemniscus of the regions superior to this.

MESENCEPHALIC ROOT SUPERIOR MEDULLARY VELUM LINGULA CEREBELLI OF TRIGEMINUS TRANSVERSE FIBRES OF PONS longitudinal fasciculus, left alone by the change in the arrangement of the lemniscus, maintains its dorsal position throughout the pons and into the mesencephalon above. The restiform body acquires in this inferior region a more dorso-lateral position than in the medulla below. Its fibres are beginning to turn upwards in their course

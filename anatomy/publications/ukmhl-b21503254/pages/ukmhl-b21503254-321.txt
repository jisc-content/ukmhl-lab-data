KERR, B.S., M.D. PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY IN THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY MEDICAL COLLEGE The auditory organ, or ear, is divided into three parts—external, middle, and internal. THE EXTERNAL EAR The external ear consists of the auricle attached to the side of the head, and the external acoustic (auditory) meatus leading from it to the middle ear (fig. 747). THE AURICLE The auricle, or pinna, presents a lateral and a medial surface. The lateral sur- face is irregularly concave (fig. 745), the deepest part of the concavity, the concha, being partially divided by an oblique ridge, the crus of the helix, into a superior Fig. 745.—Lateral Surface of the Left Auricle. part, the cymba conchae, and a larger inferior part, the cavum'conchaa. This lat- ter is directly continuous with the acoustic meatus, and is bounded ventrally by a prominent process, the tragus, which projects dorsally and overhangs the entrance to the meatus. The tragus, which has a small tubercle on it superiorly, the supra- tragic tubercle, is separated from the crus of the helix by a well-marked depression, the anterior incisure. Bounding the cavum concha? dorsally and inferiorly is a projection, the antitragus, which is situated opposite, but inferior, to the tragus, and between the two is a deep notch, the intertragic incisure. Bounding the concha dorsally and superiorly is a prominent semicircular ridge, the anthelix, ending in-

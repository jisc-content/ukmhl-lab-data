862 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM forated substance. However, the microscope shows cells scattered among the fibres of the bundle and these cells probably represent the ganglion. The white substance of the telencephalon.—A horizontal section through the upper part of the trunk of the corpus callosum will pass above the basal grey substance of the corpus striatum, and, aided by the corpus callosum, each hemi- sphere in such a section will appear as if consisting of a solid, half-oval mass of white substance, bounded without by the grey layer of the cortex (fig. 620). As seen at this level, the white substance of each hemisphere is known as the centrum semi- ovale. Horizontal sections passing below the body of the corpus callosum involve the corpus striatum and thalamus, and the appearance of the white substance is modified accordingly (fig. 640).

The projection fibres are those of a more or less vertical course, which pass to and from the cortex of the hemisphere, connecting it with the structures below the con- fines of the hemisphere. The commissural fibres are those of a transversely horizontal course, which cross the mid-line and connect the two hemispheres with each other. The association fibres are those which neither cross the mid-line nor pass beyond the bounds of the hemisphere in which they arise, but instead connect (associate) the different parts of the same hemisphere—lobes with lobes and gyri with gyri. The fibres which connect the cortex with the nuclei of the corpus striatum must be classed as association fibres also, since these masses of grey substance are a part of the telencephalon, while by definition those which connect the thalamus and hypothala-

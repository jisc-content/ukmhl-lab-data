796 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM medulla oblongata; its intermediate portion is the dorsal surface of the pons region, while its superior portion belongs to the isthmus of the rhombencephalon. Its tri- angular lower extremity terminates as the opening of the central canal of the spinal cord. This portion is deepened at the obex and shows furrows which point down- wards and converge medianwards, giving the appearance known as the calamus scriptorius. The mid-line of the ventricle is sharply distinguished by the well- marked median sulcus, which becomes shallower above than below. Throughout the length of the floor on either side of the median sulcus is a continuous ridge, the medial eminence, which is bounded laterally by the limiting sulcus. Underlying the floor of the ventricle is a layer of grey substance of varying thickness, which is continuous with that surrounding the central canal of the cord. The medial emi- nence is subdivided into portions of unequal width and elevation, and the limiting sulcus accordingly shows fovese of different depths.

The funiculus separans, a short oblique fold of the floor, composed chiefly of neuroglia, separates the area postrema from the ala cinerea (trigonum vagi), which is an oblique, grey-coloured eminence indicating the position of the middle third of the nucleus of termination (recipient nucleus) of the vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. At the superior ex- tremity of the ala cinerea is a well-marked triangular depression of the limiting sulcus known as the inferior fovea. Mesial to and extending above the ala cinerea is a narrow eminence lying close to the median sulcus, which represents the nucleus of origin of the twelfth nerve, the hypoglossal eminence (trigonum hi/poglossi). The nucleus intercalatus of Van Gehuchten is a wedge-shaped portion very slightly demarcated from the hypoglossal eminence, and lying between it and the inferior fovea. This nucleus is considered by some observers as an inferior medial ext'en-

The saccule is a flattened, oval sac, smaller than the utricle, and situated in the anterior and inferior part of the vestibule. It is bound to the spherical recess (fovea Fig. 752.—The Osseous Labyrinth op the Right Side. (Modified from Soemmerring. Enlarged.)

Anteriorly and inferiorly the saccule gradually passes into a short canal, the ductus reuniens, which connects it with the cochlear duct, and posteriorly the very small endolymphatic duct is attached. This extends through the aquseductus ves- Fig. 754.—Interior of the Osseous Cochlea.

Just beyond the saccule the endolymphatic duct is joined at an acute angle by a short canal of minute calibre, the utriculosaccular duct, which opens into the utricle

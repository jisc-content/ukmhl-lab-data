THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 778 smallest of the cranial nerves, and the only pair arising from the dorsal aspect of the brain. They undergo total decussation in the region of their exit, just behind the posterior quadrigeminate bodies. The trigeminus, or fifth cranial nerve, is the largest. It penetrates the pons to find its recipient nuclei in the depths of the brain-stem. For the most part it is a sensory nerve, but it is accompanied by a small motor root (portio minor). Three pairs of cranial nerves are attached to the brain-stem along the inferior border of the pons:—the abducens or sixth nerve emerges near the mid-line; the facial or seventh emerges from the more lateral aspect of the brain-stem; and the acoustic or eighth enters the extreme lateral aspect of the stem. The eighth con- sists of two parts, a vestibular and a cochlear division. The cochlear division courses for the most part externally and dorsally around the inferior cerebellar peduncle, giving it the appearance from which it derives its name,' restiform body.'

SUBSTANCE CEREBRAL FED UNCLE PONS ( VAROLII) PYRAMID OLIVARY BODY AMYGDALA SECTION OF SPINAL CORD INFERIOR VERMIS The remaining four pairs of the cranial nerves are attached directly to the medulla oblongata. This comprises that portion of the brain-stem beginning at the posterior border of the pons above, and continuous with the first segment of the spinal cord below. On its ventral surface the pyramids and the olives are the two most prominent structures. The pyramids, which are continuous below into the pyramidal tracts of the spinal cord, form the two tapering prominences along either side of the anterior median fissure; the olives are the oblong oval elevations situated between the pyramids and the restiform bodies, and each is the superficial indication of the inferior olivary nucleus. The glosso-pharyngeal or ninth nerve, the vagus (pneumogastric) or tenth, and the spinal accessory or eleventh cranial nerve are attached along the lateral aspect of the medulla oblongata in line with the facial nerve and between the olive and the corpus restiforme. The spinal accessory is assembled from a series of rootlets which

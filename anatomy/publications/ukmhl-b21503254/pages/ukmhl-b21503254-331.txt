1059 THE INTERNAL EAR through its anterior medial wall and. with the endolymphatic duct, connects it with the saccule. The semicircular ducts (membranous semicircular canals) are sit- uated within the osseous semicircular canals and are, therefore, known as the lateral, superior, and posterior semicircular ducts. They connect with the utricle by five openings, the posterior and superior ducts uniting to form a common crus before Fig. 755.—Diagram of the Left Membranous Labyrinth. (Deaver.)

Each duct is less than a third of the diameter of the bony canal, from which it is separated by a large perilymphatic space, except along the greater curvature, where it is attached. The ducts are dilated in the bony ampullae, pro- ducing the lateral, superior, and posterior membranous ampullae, and on the attached surface of each of these there is a transverse groove, the ampullary sulcus, Fig. 756.—Right Membranous Labyrinth of a Newborn Child.

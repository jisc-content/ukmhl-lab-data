THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 976 anterior border. From the geniculum it runs dorsalwards in the facial canal along the outer wall of the vestibule and the inner wall of the tympanum, above the fenestra vestibuli (ovahs), to the junction of the inner and posterior walls of the tympanic cavity ; then, bending downwards, it descends in the posterior wall to the stylo- mastoid foramen. As soon as it emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen it turns forwards around the outer side of the base of the styloid process, and plunges into the substance of the parotid gland, where it divides into its cervico-facial and temporo-facial terminal divisions. The Sensory Root (the pars intermedia or nerve of Wrisberg) .—The fibres of the sensory root spring from the cells of the geniculate ganglion, which is situated in the facial canal (aqueduct of Fallopius) immediately behind the hiatus Fallopii. The central processes pass inwards in the trunk of the nerve along the facial canal to the internal auditory meatus, where they leave the trunk and form the pars intermedia, which passes inwards in the meatus and then slightly downwards in the posterior fossa of the cranium to the medulla, which it enters immediately below the lower border of the pons and between the motor root of the seventh nerve and the entering roots of the acoustic nerve. After entering the medulla the fibres pass backwards FIBRES FROM THIRD NERVE NUCLEUS OF SIXTH NERVE NUCLEUS OF SEVENTH NERVE PARS INTER- MEDIA INTERNAL AUDITORY MEATUS SMALL SUPERFICIAL PETROSAL NERVE FENESTRA VESTIBULI Fig. 704.—Diagram of the Seventh Nerve. facial canal .GENICULATE GANGLION EXT.

The sensory root or pars intermedia contains a few motor fibres probably acquired during its blending with the motor root. It is, therefore, somewhat mixed in function. The geniculate ganglion is embedded in the anterior border of the geniculum of the seventh nerve behind the hiatus Fallopii. It gives origin to the greater part of the pars intermedia or sensory root of the seventh nerve. Its anterior angle is connected with the great superficial petrosal nerve, and its external angle is connected with fibres which afterwards leave the seventh nerve in its chorda tympani branch (fig. 704). Communications and Branches.—(a) In the internal auditory meatus the pars intermedia gives two delicate filaments to the vestibular division of the audi- tory nerve, and it is stated that filaments are also given from the facial to the auditory artery and to the temporal bone. (6) In the facial canal five important branches are given off, and a communica- tion is received from the sympathetic on the middle meningeal artery. (I)- The Great Superficial Petrosal Nerve has been described in detail as a root of the spheno-palatine ganglion (p. 972). It arises from the geniculate ganglion of the seventh nerve, enters the middle fossa of the cranium through the hiatus Fallopii,

942 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM The anterior branch forms a communication with the accessory obturator nerve, if that nerve is present, and then descends behind the pectineus and adductor longus and in front of the obturator externus and adductor magnus muscles (fig. 690). Its branches are:— 1. A communicating twig to the accessory obturator nerve if the latter is present. 2. An articular branch to the hip-joint. 3. Muscular branches to the gracilis, adductor longus, and, usually, to the adductor brevis. 4. Two terminal branches, of which one is distributed to the femoral artery and the other communicates with the subsartorial plexus. The subsartorial branch Fig. 690.—Anterior Crural and Obturator Nerves. (Ellis.) Femoral vein Femora! artery is occasionally longer than usual, and it then descends, along the posterior border of the sartorius, to the inner side of the knee, where it enters the subcutaneous tissue, and, proceeding downwards, supplies the skin on the inner side of the leg as far as the middle of the calf. It anastomoses with the saphenous. The posterior branch (fig. 690) pierces the upper part of the obturator externus and passes downwards between the adductor brevis and adductor magnus. Its branches are:— 1. Muscular branches to the obturator externus, the oblique fibres of the adductor magnus, and to the adductor brevis when the latter is not entirely sup-

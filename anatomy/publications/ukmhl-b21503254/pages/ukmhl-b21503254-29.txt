THE SPINAL CORD 757 the encephalon. After birth it grows more rapidly and for a longer period than the encephalon, increasing in weight more than sevenfold, while the brain increases less than half that amount. Its specific gravity is given as T038. The line of division between the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata is arbi- trary. The outer border of the foramen magnum is commonly given, or, better, a transverse line just below the decussation of the pyramids. Lying in the vertebral canal, the adult cord usually extends to the upper border of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. However, cases may be found in which it extends no farther than the last thoracic vertebra. Up to the third month of intra-uterine life it occupies Fig. 564.—Diagram illustrating the Gross Divisions of the Central Nervous System. the entire length of the vertebral canal, but owing to the fact that the vertebral column lengthens more rapidly and for a longer period than does the spinal cord, the latter, being attached to the brain above, soon ceases to occupy the entire canal. At birth its average extent is to the body of the third lumbar vertebra. External morphology.—In position in the body, the spinal cord conforms to the curvatures of the canal in which it lies. In addition to the bony wall of the vertebral canal, it is enveloped and protected by its three membranes or men- inges, which are continuous with the like membranes of the encephalon: first, the pia mater, which closely invests the cord and sends ingrowths into its substance,

992 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Fig. 710.—Diagram showing Areas of Distribution of Cutaneous Nerves. Head:— ..... Red—First division of trigeminus. White—Second division of trigeminus. Blue—Third division of trigeminus. Dark area—Posterior primary divisions of cervical nerves. Oblique and transverse shading—Branches of cervical plexus. Body and Limbs:— _ _ Recl—Anterior branches of anterior primary divisions. Blue—Posterior branches of anterior primary divisions. Two colours in one area indicate that the area is supplied by two sets of nerves, and it should be remembered that wherever two nerve areas approach each other they overlap. The dotted blue area of the small sciatic indicates that the nerve comes from the posterior as well as from the anterior parts of the anterior primary di- visions of the sacral nerves, but it supplies a flexor area. The area of the perforating cutaneous nerve is left uncoloured, because its true nature is uncertain. Dark shading Posterior primary divisions. The numbers and initial letters refer to the respective spinal nerves from which the nerves are derived. 1st DIVISION OF TRIGEMINUS 3d DIVISION OF TRIGEMINUS 2d DIVISION OF TRIGEMINUS GREA T A URICULAR CUTANEOUS COLLI, 2,3 C SUPRA-CLA VICULAR AXILLARY LATERAL CUTANEOUS NERVES ANTERIOR CUTANEOUS NERVES MEDIAL BRACHIAL CUTANEOUS AND INTERCOSTO- BRACHIAL, 1,2 T .

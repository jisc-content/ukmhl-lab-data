School of medicine THE LATERAL VENTrUMMERSITY OF L^pDS. THE LATERAL VENTRICLES Two of the four cavities of the ventricular system of the brain are in the telencephalon. Form their position, one in each cerebral hemisphere, they are known'as the lateral ventricles. They arise as lateral dilations of the cavity of the anterior of the primary vesicles, and, just as the fourth ventricle remains in communication with the third by way of the aquaeductus cerebri, so the lateral are connected with the third by the two interventricular foramina (Monroi). The whole ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord, is lined Fig. 632.—A Cast of the Four Ventricles of the Encephalon. (After Welcker.)

Each lateral ventricle is of an irregular, horseshoe shape. It consists of a central portion or body and three cornua, which correspond to the three poles of the hemi- sphere. The portion projecting into the frontal lobe is known as the anterior cornu, that projecting into the occipital lobe is the posterior cornu, and the portion which sweeps downwards into the temporal lobe is the inferior cornu. The ventricles of dif- Fig. 633.—Diagram of Sagittal Section through Lateral Part of Right Hemisphere showing Lateral Ventricle from the Outer Side. CHORIOID PLEXUS OF INFERIOR CORNU ANTERIOR COMMISSURE ferent individuals vary considerably in capacity, and the cavity of a given ventricle is not uniform throughout. In some localities the space may be quite appreciable, while in other places the walls may be approximate or even in apposition. Each lateral ventricle is a completely closed cavity except at the interventricular foramen. However, a strip of the floor of the inferior cornu is separated from the exterior of the brain by only the thin, non-nervous lamina forming the floor of the chorioid fissure.

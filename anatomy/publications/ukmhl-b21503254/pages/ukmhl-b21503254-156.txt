SS4 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM penetrate the dura. Along its dorsal aspect the spinal dura mater is practically free from the wall of the vertebral canal. (5) At its lower and funnel-shaped extremity, opposite the second sacral vertebra, the tube suddenly contracts into a filament extending into the coccyx and breaking up into a number of processes which become continuous with the periosteum of the dorsal surface of the coccyx. This filament is the coccygeal ligament or filum of the dura mater, and its attachment may be considered the lower fixation-point of the spinal dura mater. The extent of the tube is maintained chiefly by means of the two fixation-points, for all the other attachments are sufficiently loose to permit of the movements of the vertebral column. Fig. 656.—Dorsal Aspect of the Medulla Oblongata and Spinal Cord with the Dura Mater Partially Removed. (Hirschfeld and Leveille.) A B The inner surface of the spinal dura mater appears smooth, but upon closer ex- amination it is found to be connected with the arachnoid by a few delicate subdural trabecular—occasional fine strands of connective tissue bridging the subdural space (fig. 665). Along its lateral aspects the inner surface is at intervals quite firmly at- tached to the pia mater by the dentations of the ligamenta denticulata, which are prolonged through the arachnoid. Further, it is continuous at intervals with both the pia mater and arachnoid by way of the connective-tissue sheaths of the nerve-roots which are prolonged from the pia and blend with the dura mater in the passage of the

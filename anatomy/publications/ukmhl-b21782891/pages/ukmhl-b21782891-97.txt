DISEASES AND INJURIES OF ARTERIES. 89 mitral and tricuspid regurgitant murmurs. Two days after the seizure both legs became gangrenous, and she died a week after the onset of the disease. At the post-mortem examination the heart was found to weigh thirteen ounces, and the mitral and tricuspid valves were both diseased. See Elizabeth Ward Bouh for 1885, No. 274. 1571f. The left External Iliac and Femoral Arteries from a case in which gangrene of the thigh occurred as the result of the lodgment of an embolus in the common femoral artery. The embolus is lodged at the termination of the common femoral, and is apparently derived from a vegetation on the aortic valves of the heart. The superficial femoral and profunda vessels were plugged with a dark-coloured and adherent clot for a distance of three inches below the embolus. The clot has not extended upwards probably because two muscular branches are given off from the femoral immediately above the seat of impaction. 1887 From a man, aged 63, who was the subject of aortic disease. The patient went to bed in his usual health on the seventh night before his death. On waking in the morning he felt a sudden pain as of " cramp " in his left hip. Within half an hour his leg and foot became numb, and on the second day a gangrenous patch was observed over the area of distribution of the descending branch of the external circumflex artery.

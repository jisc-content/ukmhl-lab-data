A Section of the Spleen from a woman, aged thirty-five, whose liver was largely infiltrated with a growth due to actinomycosis. The spleen was enlarged, weighing twelve ounces, and was very adlierent to the surrounding structures ; a portion of the diaphragm and of the left lung are seen to be attached to the upper border. About the lower third of the spleen was occupied by a flesh-like growth, uniform in consistence, with a fairly well defined border ; two or three similar but smaller masses existed in other parts. Near the centre was a small cavity (seen in the specimen), which contained gelatinous material similar to that found in the liver. 1890 Portions of the liver are preserved in Series xxi., No. 2239b. See also Medical Post-Mortem Register, vol. xvi., p. 3. 2308a. A Spleen which has been torn upon its anterior and external surfaces, the laceration extending completely across the organ. The site of the injury is occupied by a firm white scar, measuring one-eiglith of an inch across. The outermost convex border is still soft and lacerable ; it tore when it was separated from the superjacent clot. 1888 From a woman, aged 42, who jumped out of a second-floor window ten weeks before her death.

She received other severe injuries, namely, fracture of the six upper ribs on the right side, with laceration of the right lung. There was also a small rupture of the right lobe of the liver.

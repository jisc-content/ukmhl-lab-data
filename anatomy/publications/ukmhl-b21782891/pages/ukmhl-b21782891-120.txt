The ingrowth extends deeply beneath the ulcer, so that it invades the muscular tissue. 1888 From a man, aged ii, who appears to have suffered from syphilis twenty years previously. The growth on his tongue was only noticed for two months before the operation. See Male Surgical Register, vol. i. (1886), No. 3367. 1788i. The Larynx and Trachea with the Stump of the Tongue. The entire tongue had been removed fourteen days previously for epithelioma, the patient subsequently dying from suppurative phlebitis of the internal jugular vein.

The larger occupies the right border, the smaller is at the tip. Both of the ulcers have hard and raised edges, and there is a considerable amount of fungating outgrowth of the larger ulcer : they both, when examined microscopically, were found to be typical squamous-celled epitheliomas. See Male Surgical Register, vol. v. (1889), No. 3504. 1891 1791a.

See Female Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1889), No. 571. 17961). An Epulis, together with the second bicuspid tooth, removed from the upper jaw. On removing the tooth, in order to get a full exposure of the gum, the growtli, which is seen to be closely connected with the tooth, came away at the same time. It is of a flat oval shape, with here and there small white nodules of firmer consistence which do not contain bony material. 1890 Microscopical examination shows the growth to consist of fibrous tissue. A specimen is preserved in Series Iv., No. 219. From a woman, aged 28, who had noticed the tumour for one year.

DISEASES OF THE OVUM AND ITS MEMBRANES, 258 EARLY ABORTION (TMrd Month). 3056a. The whole mass is oval in shape : it has been cut through longitudinally, and consists of two easily distinguishable portions, viz.:â€” (a.) The developing placenta and shrunken amniotic sac, in which no embryo could be found : this is situated at the lower part of the specimen. (b.) The decidual cavity, greatly distended with blood : this is closed, preventing the escape of the effused blood. From the shape of the specimen it appears probable that, if abortion had not taken place, the placenta would have been pierced, 1892 From a healthy woman, aged 30, who had borne two children; this was the first mis- carriage. A drawing of the specimen, when fresh, is preserved in Series Ivii., No. 1012. Presented by W. S. A. Griffith, M.D. 3058a. A Foetus in its Membranes. It is less than half an inch in length, and imperfectly developed. Between the decidua reflexa and the chorion blood has been effused, and forms tuberous masses projecting into the amniotic cavity. 35.96 3058b. A Foetus and Decidua Serotina, at about the fifth week. On the surface are seen hemorrhagic bosses beneath the chorion. The cord is atrophied at its placental end and also in the middle of its length by torsion or atrophy. 33.96 3058c. A specimen of early Abortion. The constriction of the cord and the haemor- rhagic bosses are very well shown. 1883 Presented by Dr. Gibson. 3058d.. Decidua from a married woman, aged twenty-three years, who had suffered from menorrhagia for six months after missing one monthly period. 1883 3062a. Portion of an Umbilical Cord, very much enlarged, and containing many elongated cyst-like spaces filled with a gelatinous material, and probably produced by mucoid degeneration of its connective tissue. Some of these cysts are laid open or cut across ; their walls are smooth. 1881

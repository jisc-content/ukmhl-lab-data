Portion of an Occipital Bone with the three Upper Cervical Vertebrae, showing a lateral dislocation of long standing with subsequent ankylosis of the occipito-atlantoid articulation. There has been recent caries of the left atlanto- axoid joint and odontoid process. Death resulted from dislocation of the odontoid process. The firmness of the ankylosis leads to the conclusion that the patient had in early life suffered from caries of the upper cervical spine which terminated in a natural cure. 1889 From a labourer, aged 37, who fell headlong down a flight of steps whilst he was being ejected from a public-house. He subsequently experienced some pain with slight stiffness about the neck, but was able to continue his work for eight weeks, when he was admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Chatham. He died quite suddenly on the following day. At the time of his admission to the Hospital he was suffering from complete paralysis of both arms and legs ; he spoke in a whisper, and deglutition was performed with difficulty.

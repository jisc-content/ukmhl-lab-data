DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER. 198 LITHOTRITY. 2444a- The Bladder and Kidney of a patient upon whom lithotrity had been ineffectually performed shortly before death. The left kidney is much enlarged, and contains numerous small miliary abscesses in its cortex. The right kidney is small, its pyramids are absorbed, and its pelvis is much dilated. The bladder is contracted and thickened ; there is a small pouch behind the prostate. It contains three pieces of recently broken uric acid calculus. In the dilated prostatic urethra is another portion of the same calculus. The fragments together weigh seventeen drachms. 1887 From a patient, aged 59, who was admitted to the Hospital in a dying condition. See 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. ii. (1885), No. 3038. EPITHELIOMA OF THE BLADDER, REMOVED DURING LIFE. 2445b. A Portion of the entire thickness of the Wall of the Bladder, measuring three inches in length by two inches in breadth. Its vesical surface presents a large circular ulcer, which is somewhat cup-shaped. The ulcer extends deeply into the muscular coat of the bladder. Microscopically, it is an epithelioma. 1889 From a man, aged 70, who had suflerod from htematuria for eight months. The bladder was opened by a supra-pubic incision, and the ulcer was then seen to be situated at the apex, and slightly at the back wall, of the organ. Before the operation could be completed, however, the patient became collapsed, and it was found necessary to close the wound, after cauterising the isleeding surface of the ulcer. Four days later the bladder was again opened, and the portion of its wall with the adherent peritoneum was excised. The patient died nine days afterwards. The post-mortem examination showed that there was no peritonitis, that the peritoneal cavity was shut off from the bladder, and that partial union of the muscular coat had taken place.

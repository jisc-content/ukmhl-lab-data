SERIES II. ABIORIAL COIDITIOIS OF THE LIMBS. CLASS I.â€”VARIATION. (b.) In the Digits. 3499a. A Supernumerary Fifth Toe. The base presents three articular facets, each covered with cartilage. 1885 Presented by A. Lyndon, Esq. 3499b. Two Symmetrical Supernumerary Little Fingers, removed from a child, five days old. Each finger was attached by a slender pedicle, and each is provided with a rudimentaiy finger-nail. Both fingers are malformed. There was no history of any other member of the family having an extra digit. 1886 Presented by A. M. Gladden, Esq. 3499c. A Supernumerary Little Finger, removed from a newly-born child. It was attached by a slender pedicle to the junction of the second and third phalanges. As a result of placing the preparation in spirit, the epidermis has shrunk away from the corium. A section into the mass shows the three small masses of cartilage which represent the phalanges. 1887 Presented by E. Evans, Esq. 3499d.. The Hands and Feet of a child, with supernumerary Digits. Each of the hands has five fingers in addition to the thumb, the nail of which in both hands is bifid. A partial division can also be traced down the whole length of the thumb ; this is most marked in the left hand. The fifth finger appears to have a metacarpal bone, and a proper and separate articulation with the carpus. A similar deformity also exists in the feet, there being a well-formed and well- articulated fifth toe in addition to the hallux. This digit, like the thumb, shows a partial division through its whole length, especially on the right side, and has a bifid nail. 1891 From a full-time well-grown child, who only lived thirty hours. In addition to a hair-lip, it had some deformity of the tongue which prevented the child from sucking. No history of extra digits in other members of the family could be obtained. Presented by J. H. Gilbertson, Esq. Z

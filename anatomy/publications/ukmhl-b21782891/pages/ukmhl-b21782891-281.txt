SEMES XLIX. AIATOIT OP STIJIPS APTEE AlPUTATIOS OP IIMBS. 3189a. A Section through a portion of the Stump of the Eight Thigh, to show the changes which have taken place as the result of an amputation through the lower third of the femur twenty days before death. The wound has completely healed, and the artery is occupied by a narrow conical clot, whilst the end of the femur is covered by a layer of fibrous tissue which blocks the medullary canal. 1888 From a man, aged 43, whose leg was amputated on account of tubercular disease of the knee-joint. See 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. i. (1887), No. 1406. 3189b. A Section through a Stump where the Amputation has been done im- mediately below the Knee. The cavity of the joint was not opened, but only a thin slice of the tibia has been left : the head of the fibula was removed. The stump is soundly healed. 1891 The limb, which was amputated, is preserved in Series 1., No. 3294b. For the history of the patient see Female Surgical Register, vol. v. (1891), No. 2545*. 3194a. The Head of a Humerus, showing an extreme degree of rarefying osteitis. 1885 From a man, aged 84, whose arm had been amputated sixteen months previously on account of gangrene. The gangrene followed a Colles' fracture. It was found after amputa- tion that the radial artery had been obliterated owing to a stab received ten years previously. See Surgical Registrar's Report (1883), Appendix, p. 73. 3195a. The Head and Neck, with the upper third of the Shaft of the Femur, from a patient, aged sixty-two, whose leg had been amputated forty years previously at the London Hospital.

The medul- lary canal is completely closed. 1888 See 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. ii. (1887), No. 2620. 3199a. A Section through the Stump of a Leg, which had to be re-amputated after Syme's operation. The original operation was performed nine years previously for a fracture.

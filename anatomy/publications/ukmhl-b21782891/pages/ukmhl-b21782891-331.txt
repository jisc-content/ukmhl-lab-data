A wax model of the top of the head, showing a large flattened, irregularly- lobed tumour of the scalp (" Withering Sarcoma "), situated over the inter-parietal suture. Running along the left parietal and frontal regions is an area two inches wide and six inches long, devoid of hair. From this situation a similar tumour was removed by operation. There are now seen two flattened swellings near the scar, and a third lies over the right frontal region. Under the microscope the tumour was found to be a Fibro-Sarcoma. 1891 One half of the tumour which was removed is preserved in Series 1., No. 3302a, and a microscopical section in Series Iv., No. 73Sa. The patient was a young man, aged 24, who, at the time of his admission into the Hospital, in March, 1890, gave the following history :â€”About six years ago he received a blow on the top of his head from the fly-wheel of an engine, but of this he took no notice. A few months later a tumour began to grow in this place, and reached the size of a sparrow's egg, and then disappeared in about six mouths. Six or eight similar tumours subsequently appeared in different parts of the head, and then diminished in size. A large tumour, ten inches in circum- ference (see Series L, No. 3302a), the scar of which is seen over the left parietal bone, appeared in September, 1889, and grew steadily until its removal in March, 1890. It caused him no pain. For further details see as above, and also 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. v. (1890), No. 972.

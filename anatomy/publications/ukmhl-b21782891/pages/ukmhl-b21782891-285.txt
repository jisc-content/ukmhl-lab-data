277 GENERAL PATHOLOGY. below the inner malleolus. As a result of the extreme inversion, the sole has been tilted upwards, so that the patient walked on the outer edge of the foot. This has caused the formation of a patch of greatly thickened skin, which is placed partly over tlie dorsal surface of the fifth metatarsal bone. It is to be noticed that this form of talipes differs in other respects from congenital or other kinds following infantile paralysis, &c., in that there is no contraction of the flexors of the toes. Both the tibia and fibula are much atrophied. 1890 From a patient, aged 11, to whom the original injury happened during infancy. See Female Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1888), No. 14. PLEURISY. 3228R. Portions of Ribs and Lung, showing the organisation of lymph to form adhesion. From a case of recent pleurisy. 1884 3228b. A similar specimen, showing the effects of a pleurisy many years previously; the adhesions are denser than in the preceding specimen, the fibrous tissue having contracted so as to form a tough membrane. 1884 LUPUS. 3233a. The lower two-thirds of a Eight Leg, removed by amputation just above the knee, on account of very extreme lupus ulceration of the skin. There is an area of scar tissue, six inches wide, encircling the leg. Dotted irregularly over this are patches of exuberant granulations, with an ulcerated surface. These are particularly numerous in the neighbourhood of the inner ankle and inner side of the heel. The limb has been partially injected. 1893 The patient was a lady, aged 68. As a child, she suffered from tubercular disease of the tarsus, from which she quite recovered. In 1870, after an attack of small-pox, a nodule of lupus occurred in the calf of the leg ; this gradually spread. Two small patches were scraped in 1889 with good efEect, but she refused to allow the whole affected area to be treated in this way. The limb was amputated in March, 1892. Microscopical sections are preserved in Series Iv., No. 690b. Presented by Alfred Willett, Esq. CHRONIC ULCER. 3233b. A Right Foot, removed by Syme's operation on account of chronic ulceration affecting the skin of the sole over the heads of the metatarsal bones. In this region the whole thickness of the skin has been completely destroyed. The edges of the ulcer are much thickened. There has also been extensive disease of several bones of the metetarsus, causing shortening and distortion of the toes. The great and fourth toes are the most affected. 1893 A drawing of the foot, before the operation, is preserved in Series Ivii., No. 1071. See also Male Surgical Register, vol. iv. (1891), No. 3390*. 3234a. The Lower Extremity of a Child, exhibiting burns of various degrees. In the upper part of the thigh the muscles are partially charred, while on some parts of the foot there is nothing more than a peeling off of the integument. 1884 GANGRENE. 3235a. Dry Gangrene of the Foot, after ligature of the femoral artery. 1881 3235b. GangTcne of the Foot, showing the commencement of the line of separation of the living from the dead tissues. 1881 3235c. A Hand, affected with dry Gangrene, as a result of idiopathic plugging of the arteries of the forearm and arm. The plug extended from the origin of the subclavian. 1884 The arteries of tiie arm are preserved, with the arch of the aoita, in Series viii., No. 1571c.

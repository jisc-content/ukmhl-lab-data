Presented by Dr. Mackie. ACUTE PHOSPHORUS-POISONING. 2238a. A Section of a Liver from a case of acute phosphorus-poisoning. The liver was of normal size. It is of an uniform orange colour. Microscopically, it showed abundant fatty degeneration with some amount of fatty infiltration. 1888 From a man, aged 36, who accidentally ate some bread and butter on which phosphorus paste had been spread. He became drowsy and giddy an hour afterwards, and subsequently vomited, and had great pain in the epigastrium.

Section of a human Liver from a case of actinomycosis. 1885 See Transactiom of the Pathological Society, vol. xxxvi. (1885), p. 254. Presented by S. G. Shattock, Esq. 2239b. Two portions of a Liver affected with Actinomycosis ; the longer specimen is part of the right lobe, the shorter part of the left. The diseased parts consist of a coarse meshwork of white fibrous tissue with a spongy or honeycombed appearance, enclosing small s[)aces of various sizes ; the section through the edge of the left lobe shows these spaces to have coalesced, forming an irregular cavity over an inch in length. The diseased masses have for the most part replaced the liver substance, and there is only a slight bulging of the surface over them. A portion of the diaphragm remains attached to the upper surface of the left lobe, to which it was firmly adherent ; the capsule of the liver itself is not thickened. 1890 From a vyoman, aged 34, who, when admitted on July 22nd, 1889, was obviously very ill, but whose symptoms were obscure. She died a fortnight later. For further particulars, see Medical Post-Mortem Register, vol. xvi, p. 3.

51 INJURIES OF BONES (fRACTUEES). 8981b. A Complete Transverse Fracture extending through the lower portion of the manubrium sterni. 1888 900a- A longitudinal section of a fractured Rib nineteen days after the injury. The fracture is oblique and the ends slightly overlap. External callus is formed along the rib for some distance from the seat of fracture ; there is scarcely any inter- mediate callus. 1882 900b. The Lung and a portion of the Chest Wall of a child. The heads of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs have been separated from their tubercles. The lung shows two large rents in its posterior lobe. 1885 900c. Ribs from a Mummy found in a tomb at the ancient Memphis. They had been fractured and are reunited with superabundant formation of bone. c. 42. 1887 (In Case H.) 903a. Apparent fracture through the Acromion Process. The fracture is united by bone. 1885 (In Case H.) Presented by J. C. Hoyle, Esq. 904a. A Clavicle, showing an Un-united Fracture of the acromial end, of ten years standing. The extremities of the fragments have become rounded off so as to form an imperfect joint, which in the recent state w;is enclosed in a capsule. From a woman, aged fifty-two. 1886 (In Case H.) See Female Surgical Register, vol. i. (1886), No. 2772*. 908a. An Extra-Capsular Fracture of the neck of the Right Humerus. The greater tuberosity has been entirely separated, whilst the shaft of the bone is fractured spirally. 1888 From a man, aged 72, who was knocked down and run over by a van a week before his death. See Male Surgical Register, vol. v. (1886), No. 3.3.37. 912a. A Compound T-shaped Fracture of the lower end of the Humerus, immediately above the Condyles. The two condyles are separated by the shaft of the humerus, which has been forced down between them. 1889 From a man, aged 21, who fell a distance of eighteen feet on to his elbow. He sustained, in addition, a dislocation of the shoulder without rupture of the capsule. The shoulder-joint is preserved in Series ii., No. 1019b. 918a. A Portion of the upper extremity of the Right Ulna. The olecranon had been fractured probably many years previously. When fresh, the olecranon was united to the shaft of the ulna by tolerably firm fibrous bands. 1886 (In Case H.) From a subject brought to the Hospital for dissection. 925a. The Lower End of the Radius, showing a comminuted fracture extending into the Wrist-Joint. The upper end of the fractured bone is slightly impacted into the lower fragment, which has undergone much comminution. The fracture has extended horizontally across the centre of the carpal articular surface, and the dorsal portion has been again divided transversely near its ulnar margin. The ulnar facet is also transversely divided, but not through its whole extent. The main line of fracture is irregular, and several pieces of bone were completely detached. 1887 The injury occurred to a man who fell from a window, a height of about eight feet. He died from the effects of a laceration of the liver and other injuries which he then received. See Kenton Ward Book, vol. ix., p. 209. E 2

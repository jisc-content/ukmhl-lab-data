SERIES XXIV. DISEASES OE THE LYMPHATIC &1AIDS AO VESSELS. 2278a. A Mass of Enlarged Lymphatic Glands removed from the Axilla of a man, aged thirty, who died from Lymphadenoma. The spleen was also affected. 1891 See Male Surgical Register, vol. ii. (1891), No. 389. 2280a. An Enlarged Lymphatic Gland of the Neck removed by operation. A section has been made through the gland, and, when fresh, large caseous masses were clearly seen, especially at the outer edge of the cut surface. The distinction between healthy and diseased tissues are now only faintly discernible. 1891 2284a. A chain of Lymphatic Glands, enlarged from the deposit of tubercle secondary to disease of the hip-joint. The lower portion, to which the left common iliac artery is attached, was situated round the brim of the pelvis, and led from the suppurating hip-joint : the upper part of the specimen lay along the left side of the aorta, and extended as high as the diaphragm. They were very firm and gritty when cut. There was no enlarge- ment on the right side either of the pelvic or abdominal glands. 1892 The hip-joint from the same case is preserved in Series ii., No. 570c, to which refer for the history of the case.

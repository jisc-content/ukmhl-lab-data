Lower temporary second Molar with three fangs. 1884 3624b. A Rudimentary Supernumerary Incisor Tooth, removed from the Pre- maxilla of a child, aged fourteen days, who had a Hare-Lip. 1891 (d.) Of the Intestines. 3632a. A case of Undescended Csecum, from an Anencephalic Foetus. The sigmoid flexure with the left colon and transverse colon are in their usual position, but the right colon is firmly attached by strong fibrous adhesions to the under-surface of the right lobe of the liver. In other respects the abdominal viscera are normal. The processus vaginales of the testes have been laid open to show that, although the c£ecum has not descended, the testicles are in their proper position. 1887 Presented by C. B. Lockwood, Esq, 3632b. A Congenital Csecocele, from an infant. The ca?cum and vermiform appendix lay in a large funicular peritoneal sac, which descended as far as, but did not communicate with, the tunica vaginalis. The caecum is entirely covered with peritoneum. There is a strong band of muscular fibres ascending from the back of the testis along the posterior wall of the sac to the CEecum and peritoneum. There is also a considerable band of muscular fibres in the perinseum, running from the external sphincter to the epididymis and back of the testis. 1890 See Transactions of the Royal 3Iedico-Chirurgieal Society, vol. Ixix., p. 479. Presented by C. B. Lockwood, Esq. 3632c. A C^cum, with a Portion of the Ileum, to which is attached an abnormally long Vermiform Appendix. This is fixed by a mesentery of its own to the back part of the ileum, and when unravelled measures rather over eight and a half inches in length. It is not dilated at any point, and is pervious throughout. 1892

A lithotrite for breaking up the fragments. (e.) Leroy's modifications of Andre de la Croix's simple lithotrite handles. 1887 Civiale writes of the cases upon which he operated with instrumeats similar to these :— " Every patient, with a single exception, was cured. Those who died some time after the operation had been performed, succumbed to causes which had nothing to do with the operation. In the larger number of cases, when an autopsy was performed, the bladder was found to be healthy, and it dfd not contain a single fragment of the calculus."—See Lettres sur la Litlioti'itie par le Docteur Civiale, Paris, 1827. 9.

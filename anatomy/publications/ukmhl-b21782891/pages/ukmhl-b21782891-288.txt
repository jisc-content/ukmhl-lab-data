GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 280 3278a. A Pendulous Growth attached to the inner side of the thigh. The tumour is nodular, and is covered with normal skin ; it is attached to the skin by a narrow pedicle. On section, it is seen to consist of a homogeneous tissue, which, on micros- copical examination, is a soft fibroma. 1889 From a woman, aged 55, in whom the tumour had been growing for ten years. See Female Surgical Register, vol. iv. (1887), No. 2702*'*. 3280a. A Pedunculated Fibro-cellular Tumour, which had been growing for more than five years from the right ischio-rectal region. The tumour is of the size of a small orange, with a complete covering of skin, except where the pedicle has been divided. On section, it presents the usual appearance of a yellowish matrix inter- sected by white fibrous bands. 1886 From a married woman, aged 25. The tumour was inconvenient, but not painful. See Female Surgical Register, vol. iv. (1886), No. 27. 3284a. A large Fibrous Tumour. 1885 3284b. A Section through a Fibrous Tumour growing from the abdominal wall. The tumour measures one and a half inches in length by one inch in breadth. The section has the characteristic appearance of a fibroma. It grew from the fascia of the external oblique muscle. 1888 From a married woman, aged 35, who had noticed a swelling in the right anterior iliac region for eight months. The tumour was hard and tense, freely moveable, but not tender. See Feviale Surgical Register, vol. i. (1888), No. 2789*. 3294a. A Sarcoma of somewhat unusual shape, which grew beneath the skin of the left side of the neck. 1885 F., ffifc. 36. First noticed six months previously. Recurrence took place before the wound healed. A drawing is preserved in Series Ivii., No. 1220, and a cast in Series Ivi., No. 212a. For further details see Female Surgical Register, vol. iv. (1885), No. 2362. 3294b. A Circular Growth which was situated over the left malar bone. The tumour measures two inches in diameter. It presented a reddish, smooth, flattened and somewhat shiny appearance, except at its centre, where there is a small patch of ulceration. The skin is implicated and discoloured on the surface, but not around the edge of the sweUing. Microscopically, it is a mixed-celled sarcoma. 1889 From a married woman, aged 23, in whom the swelling had been growing for eight months. It was said to have originated in a gnat-bite. The growth was freely moveable on the sub- jacent tissue. A microscopical section is preserved in Series Iv., No. 524. A drawing is preserved in Series Ivii., No. 1214. See Female Surgical Register, vol. v. (1888), No. 2512. SARCOMA OCCURRING- IN A CHRONIC ULCER OF THE LEG-, 3294c. A portion of a Left Leg, extending from just below the Knee to just above the Ankle, which was removed by amputation on account of a malignant disease which occurred in the site of a chronic ulcer of the leg, which had existed for many years. The inner side of the leg is the part most extensively affected. Here the nicer measures eight inches across. Its edges are raised, and there is considerable increase of tissue all round the margin. The back of the calf and front of the leg are also involved, and except for a space of rather more than one inch in breadth, the ulcer extends completely round the limb. Microscopical examination of the margin showed that it was a round-celled sarcoma. 1893

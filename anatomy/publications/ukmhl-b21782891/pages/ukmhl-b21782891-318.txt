Cast of the Left Elbow of a boy, showing a dislocation backwards of the radius and ulna. 1888 Prom a boy, aged 10 years, who fell on his elbow three months before the cast was taken, fracturing his coronoid process, and dislocating his radius and ulna. The dislocation was reduced at once, but it subsequently recurred. See Male Surgical Register, vol. i. (1887), No. 3257. 41c. Oast of the Left Elbow of a man, aged twenty-one, who had sustained a dis- location of the Eadius two years previously. The head of the radius is extremely prominent, and is covered by skin only : there was free rotation. 1892 43a. Cast of the Eight Hand and Wrist of a woman, aged sixty-two, who had dislocated her hand forwards fifty-five years previously. The lower end of the ulna is very prominent. 1890 There was fair movement. The hand could be supinated through about 45Â°. Flexion was good, but extension was much restricted. The grasp of the hand was much less than that of the other. See Female Surgical Register, vol. v. (1890), No. 58. 45a. Cast of the Wrist of a patient whose ulna was dislocated, and whose radius was fractured an inch above its carpal extremity. 1885 47a.

The cast shows the characteristic " saddle-back " which is due to the deformity. 1889 49a. Two Casts of the Right Knee-Joint, showing dislocation of the Patella outwards. One of the casts is taken in the extended, the other in the flexed position of the limb. In the latter the displacement is the more marked. 1891 The patient, a lad, aged 18, was run over eight years previously. The limb was treated for three months in a plaster of Paris case. When this was removed, the dislocation became apparent, and had remained so. He could walk fairly well, provided that he kept the knee- joint stiff. 54a.

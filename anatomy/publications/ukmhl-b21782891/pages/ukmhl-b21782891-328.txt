320 CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED AND INJURED PAKTS. The tumour was found to be a cyst, and was dissected out. It moved slightly with the larynx in deglutition, but was considered to be unconnected with the thyroid gland. A photograph is preserved in Series Ivii., No. 1303. See Male Surgical Register, vol. v. (1891), No. 695. 1381. Casts of the Hands of a woman, aged forty-seven, suffering from Myxoedema. 1893 ISSin. Casts of the Hands of the same woman as the preceding, taken seven weeks subsequently, after she had undergone treatment by the subcutaneous injection of thyroid juice. 1893 Photographs are preserved in Series Ivii., Nos. 1175 and 1176. 142a. Cast of the Cerebral Hemispheres of a patient, who died with effusion of blood, resulting from rupture of the middle meningeal artery accompanying a fracture of the base of the skull. The frontal lobe on the left side is very considerably flattened, the flattening being best marked upon its superior surface. 1889 See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1889), No. 124. 143a. Cast of the Head of a boy, in whom, after fracture of the skull, a hernia cerebri resulted. The surface has not yet completely healed over, but up to the time the cast was taken (ten months after the accident) no bad results had followed. 1882 143b. Cast of a portion of the right side of the Face of a man, aged twenty-four, showing the situation of a hernia cerebri. 1889 Seven years before the cast was taken the patient fell down and cut his head just above the external angle of the orbital plate of the right frontal bone. The injury was followed by epileptic attacks, for the relief of which he was trephined. A hernia cerebri subsequently appeared at the seat of operation. Ten months after the operation the cast preserved in Series Ivi., No. 143a, was taken. The patient was re-admitted to the Hospital seven years afterwards for epilepsy. See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1889), No. 3826*. 143c. Cast of the Face of the same patient from whom the preceding cast was taken. This, the third cast, was made after an interval of eleven months. It shows that the distance from the centre of the bridge of the nose to the tip of the lobule of the ear is half an inch less on the affected than on the sound side. 1889 144a. Cast of a Hand, from a patient, the fingers of whose right hand were contracted after inflammation. An old wound of the median nerve had been followed by partial ankylosis of the phalangeal joints, with trophic changes in the skin of the nails and muscles. 1885 See Male Surgical Register, vol. i. (1884), No. 3336. 14413. Cast of a Hand, from a patient whose ulnar nerve had been divided eight months previously. 1885 See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1884), No. 570. 1440. Cast of the Left Hand of a patient seven months after section of the ulnar nerve. The muscles are extremely atrophied and the fingers are somewhat "clawed." 1886 144ci. Cast of the Left Hand of the same patient a year after the operation of secondary suture. The muscles are almost completely regenerated. 1886 See Barker Ward Booli,, vol. viii., p. 380. 144^. Cast of the Eight Hand of a patient, eighteen months after division of the ulnar nerve. The muscles are wasted and the hand is typically clawed. 1886 See 3Ial6 Surgical Register, vol. iii.

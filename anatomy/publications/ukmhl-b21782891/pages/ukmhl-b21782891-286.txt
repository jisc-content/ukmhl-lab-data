GENERAL PATHOLOGY. 78 3235d. A Hand, aflected with dry gangrene, resulting from embolism of the arteries. 1885 The heart and arteries are preserved in Series viii., No. 1571d. See Male Surgical Register, vol. i. (1884), No. 3637. 3235e. A Foot, with the Lower Third of the Leg, which has been affected with dry gangrene. The dead soft textures had separated from the living, and the foot was apparently removed by sawing through the bone. 1888 From a lady, aged 42, who had nursed her son through a mild attack of scarlet fever. Daring his convalescence, and when the desquamation was nearly completed, she was taken ill with sudden pyrexia and sore throat, but she had no rash. In a day or two she was attacked with pneumonia, affecting both lungs. This was attended with great cardiac depres- sion, and death appeared certain, with all the symptoms of cardiac clot. She continued in this condition for a few days, and then symptoms of blocking of both popliteal arteries super- vened, and both feet became gangrenous. She made a good recovery. There were no symptoms of ulcerative endocarditis. The other leg is in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, No. 223a. Presented by Thomas P. Greenwood, Esq. 3235f. The Anterior Part of a Foot, removed after death from a man, aged sixty- three, who had senile gangrene. The whole of the skin is discoloured, but unevenly and in irregular patches ; that over the dorsum of the great and little toes has lost its epidermis, is much darker than the rest, and has become gangrenous ; there is a well-marked line of demarca- tion. Both the anterior and posterior tibial arteries were filled with old white adherent clot. Symptoms commenced one year before death. 1890 See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1888), No. 2747. 3235g". The Middle Finger of the Eight Hand, removed by operation for Gangrene. The whole of the ungual phalanx and the distal half of the second phalanx is dis- coloured and of a dusky ashen-grey colour, and the line of demarcation is clearly seen.

The Phalanges of the Toes of the Eight Foot, which mortified owing to an embolus lodging in the common femoral artery. 1888 A woman, aged 37, had a sudden onset of pain nine days after an abortion. The pain occurred whilst walking across the room. It was felt in the left groin, and was followed by a burning sensation and numbness in the foot. See Female Surgical Register, vol. v.

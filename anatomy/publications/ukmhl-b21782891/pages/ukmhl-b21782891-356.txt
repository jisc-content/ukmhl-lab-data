SERIES IX. ABNORMAL COIfDITIOIfS OF THE OMAUS OE SPECIAI SEirSE. 3682a. Super-numerary Auricles, remoyed from a male child, aged six months. The auricles appear to he developed round the mandibular and hyo-mandibular clefts. They were arranged as follows :—In a line from the angle of the mouth to the external auditory meatus was (A) a small nodule of the size of a pea ; it had a narrow peduncle and was soft, and so far as could be ascertained, without making a microscopical examination, it did not contain any cartilage. (B) A firmer and rather larger growth, globular in shape and with a longer peduncle than (A). These growths appeared to be mandibular in origin. The other three growths were hyo-mandibular, and were situated in the neighbour- hood of the tragus, (i.) The first was in the position of a normal tragus ; it had a long rounded cartilaginous and ridge-like stalk. It extended along the anterior wall of, and projected into, the external auditory meatus. Its extremity was globular, freely projecting, smooth, rounded, and cartilage-containing, (ii.) and (iii.) These two auricles were confluent, the upper globular and the more prominent, the lower ridge-like, very prominent, and extending towards (i.). Both these growths are a little above the level of the tragus ; both contain cartilage, and possess in common a laterally flattened ridge-like base. The rest of the right pinna was well formed. There were no deformities of the left pinna, and no fistulse through either. There were no branchial clefts, and no deformities were found. 1889 From a first-born child, aged six months. No deformities were known to occur congenitally in the family on either side. He made a good recovery after the removal of the super-numerary auricles.

311 CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED AND INJURED PARTS. 66a. Cast of the Head, and Neck of a child.

Casts of the front of the Neck and upper part of the Chest of a young woman who suffered from " Wry-neck." Both of the lower attacliments of the right sterno- mastoid muscle stand out as firm fibrous cords, causing the chin to be tilted towards the' left shoulder.

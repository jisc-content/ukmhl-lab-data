The middle finger was removed during childhood. The fourth and fifth fingers are similarly affected, but to a smaller extent. There was reason to suppose that the deformity was due to the growth of cartilaginous tumours, which appeared to have ossified. 1888 From an out-patient. 6b. Cast of the Right Arm and Hand, from a patient, aged eighteen, who had multiple exostoses on his femora, ribs, and right ulna.

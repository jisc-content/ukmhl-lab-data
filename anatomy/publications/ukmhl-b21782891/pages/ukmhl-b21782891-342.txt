Presented by W. J. Walsham, Esq. 334 ABNOKMAL CONDITIONS OF THE LIMBS. The twist of the foot inwards has caused the abductor hallucis to assume a more lateral attachment, so that its main origin is from the external annular ligament, a slip of muscle only passing backwards to the inner tuberosity of the os calcis. This alteration in the axis of the foot leaves a gap between the contiguous sides of the abductor pollicis and the flexor brevis digitorum, in which can be seen the flexor longus pollicis tendon as far back as the point where it is crossed by the flexor longus digitorum. Microscopical examination of the anterior and posterior tibial nerves failed to show that they had undergone any degenerative changes. 1888 From a boy, aged li, who had old disease of the right Isnee, with double talipes equino- varus, cavus, and clawed toes. The trouble with his feet was said to have begun when he was six years old. He then went to Charing Cross Hospital, where the plantar fascia was divided, the feet being put up in splints. On admission to the Hospital, both feet were in a condition of talipes cavus, flexed slightly inwards, with some equinus. The flexion of both feet inwards at the mid-tarsal joint is accompanied by partial dislocation backwards of all the toes at the metatarsal-phalangeal joints. This dislocation is especially marked in the great- toes. There was much wasting of the right leg. See 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1887), Mo. 1538. 35141b. Portion of a Foot in which the fourth toe is in a condition of " hammer-toe." The muscles and tendons have all been dissected away, to show that the deformity is dependent upon alterations in the glenoid ligament, and in the fibres of the lateral ligaments which approach the glenoid. 1889

C0N6ENTTAL MALFORMATIONS. 375 107. Cast of an Unusual Deformity of the Clavicles, occurring in a boy, aged eleven years. Tlie sternal portion of the clavicles are natural, but their acromial ends are wanting, the bones terminating in pointed extremities, which appear to rest on the coracoid processes. The movements of the arms were quite natural. The patient was admitted to the Hospital for lateral curvature of the spine. 1889 See 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1888), No. 2964. 108. Cast of the Head of a boy, aged eleven years, who had a well-marked rickety skull. The head is large, and tapers from the occipital towards the frontal region. The forehead does not overhang the face, as is the case in hydrocephalus. 1889 From the same patient who had deformed clavicles. (No. 107 in this Series). See 3Ialr Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1888), No. 2964. 109. A Cast of the External Genital Organs of a man, aged thirty-seven. The penis and scrotum are undeveloped and the testes have not descended. There is no hair on the pubes. 1889 The patient was a very large and fat man, with a perfectly smooth face ; he was macried, but had no children by his wife. His voice was high pitched. Examination, per rectum, showed that only the floor of the prostate had been developed. See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1889), No. 3464*. 110. Cast of the Left Arm of a patient, aged thirty-eight, who had a congenital defect of the ulna. The left hand was bent towards the ulnar side, and could not be straightened ; it was smaller than the right. The ulna terminated in a point about two inches above the carpal bones, but it was continued onwards by a band of ligament. The patient also had multiple exostoses. 1889 See Matthew Ward Booh for 1889, s. v. Edwin Duckham. 111. Cast of the Face of a man who had a congenital meningocele. The tumour was soft and pulsating ; it was situated at the root of the nose in the middle line, and had separated the nasal bones. Firm pressure caused the tumour to become smaller, and it only refilled slowly. It grew until the patient was eighteen years of age ; at the time the cast was taken he was thirty. 1889 A photograph is preserved in Series xxxviii., No. 1334. See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1889), No. 1431. 112. Casts of the Hands and Feet of an out-patient. There is congenital absence of the plialanges of all the fingers and toes, with the exception of the fifth in each case. In the feet it appears as if the metatarsals were also wanting in some cases. The left foot has a well-developed great toe, which is absent on the right side. 1889 113. Cast of the under surface of a Liver, showing several small supernumerary lobules. 1891

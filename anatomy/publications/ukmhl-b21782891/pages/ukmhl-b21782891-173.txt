DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE GALL BLADDER AND BILIARY DUCTS. 165 2264b. A number of small Gall-Stones removed from the gall-bladder of the pre- ceding specimen. They are mostly the size of small peas, and of a pale yellow colour : a few are larger, of a light brown colour, and facetted. The fine pigmented granules were also taken from the gall-bladder, in the walls of which some still remain. 1890 2266a. A Gall-Bladder and part of a Liver, showing a small epitheliomatous papillary growth in the former, and secondary cancerous deposits in the latter. 1883 PUNCTURED WOUND OF THE GALL-BLADDER. 2268a. A Portion of the Liver with the Gall-Bladder. At about one inch from the neck of the gall-bladder there is a small rounded opening perforating all the coats. 1893 From a boy, aged 15, who fell from a load of straw on to a pitchfork, one prong entering the abdominal wall just above the right anterior superior spine of the ilium. It passed up- wards in the substance of the abdominal wall before entering the peritoneal cavity ; it then bruised the anterior edge of the liver, grazed the under surface of the gall-bladder, and finally perforated it at the orifice now seen. The boy died five days later. At the autopsy it was found that a great deal of bile had been cxtravasated into the peritoneal cavity, and had caused much matting together of the intestines.

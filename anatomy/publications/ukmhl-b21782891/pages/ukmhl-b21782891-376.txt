After passing through its chrysalis state, it becomes one of the night-moths of New Zealand. Its Maori name is Pepeawato. The plant is the Hepiolus vii'escens. The spore is parasitic, and becomes fixed between the head and the first ring of the body. More rarely the spore takes up its position between the last and the penultimate segment of the caterpillar. The caterpillar buries itself for the chrysalis stage, and the spore grows, utilising the tissues, and absorbing all the interior of the insect until it dies. The caterpillars thus affected were charred, and used by the Maoris as the pigment with which they tattooed their faces. {Cf. Botanical Catalogue, p. 255.) 1889 Presented by C. A. Parker, Esq. 1562a.

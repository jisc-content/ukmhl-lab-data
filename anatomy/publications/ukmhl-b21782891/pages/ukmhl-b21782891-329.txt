She was the subject of pulmonary phthisis. The right hand has long tapering fingers, the nails are curved, and the thumb is slightly bulbous. In the left hand there is a scar between the tendons of the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor sublimis digitorum, situated just above the annular ligament, and marking the site of the division of the median nerve. It is situated on the long axis of the forearm. The abductor and part of the flexor brevis pollicis muscles are wasted. The little finger is contracted and flexed at the joint of the first and second phalanges, but this was congenital. The index and middle fingers are wasted and their movement is impaired. The fingers themselves are glossy, and their nails are all too much curved. Sensation was unimpaired. 1889 See Faith Ward Book for 1889, s.v. M. Dayman. Drawings of the hands are preserved in Series Ivii., No. 730. 147a. Cast of the Right Leg of a patient, aged twenty-one years, who had an advanced condition of ichthyosis. The skin of the thigh presents a remarkably papillated appearance. At the line of flexion of the knee and ankle the papillaj are replaced by smooth integument. The knee was capable of considerable hyper- extension, so that it could be brought into the condition known as " back-knee." 1889 From an unmarried woman, whose hip had been excised eight and a half years previously. The ichthyotic condition had been gradually increasing for five years. The opposite limb was healthy, and there was no evidence of xeroderma in other parts of her body.

The tumour, which was not ulcerated on the surface, has been laid open, and to the naked eye appears to consist of a collection of cysts the size of small peas filled with gelatinous- looking material. Under the microscope, this was found to be composed of large flat epithelial cells arranged in masses : no " nest-cells " are to be seen, nor does the surface epithelium, which is somewhat thickened, dip into the masses of cells. The growth probably arose in the sebaceous glands of the scalp: it has assumed a carci- nomatous character instead of that of a simple sebaceous cyst. 1891 From a woman, aged 44. The tumour had been slowly enlarging for seven or eight years in the site of a sebaceous cyst; the lymphatic glands were not aflEected. See Female Surg ical Heg ister, vol. ii. (1889), No. 2255.

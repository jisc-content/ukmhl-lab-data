Presented by Samuel West, M.D. 210 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE BEAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES. around tlie apertui'e are adherent, but there is no other evidence of meningitis. The portion of the brain corresponding with the left frontal lobes, which were dis- organised, appear to be contracting by a process of cicatrisation. 1886 From a man, aged 38, who shot himself through the mouth with a revolver. He survived the injury one month, and during this time remained in a state of stupor unless he was roused, when he was cheerful and possessed some memory. See Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. xxxvii., p. 3. Presented by C. B. Lockwood, Esq. 2530a. Sections through the Cerebral Hemispheres, from a case of aphasia, in which the chief lesions were seated in the supra-marginal and angular gyri, Broca's convolution being unaftected. On the left side of the brain, corresponding with the whole extent of the supra-marginal and angular convolutions, is a large area of softening, which, in the recent condition, was considerably depressed below the level of the rest of the cortex. The colour was pale yellow, and the surface was speckled with small patches of white and yellow (fatty change). The softening appears to have been due to embolism of the peripheral branch of the Sylvian artery. 1885 For further details and history of the case see the British Medical Journal, vol. i. (1885), Pi' 1242, and the Medical Society's Proceedings, vol. viii. Photographs of the case are preserved in Series Ivii., Nos. 699a, b, and c.

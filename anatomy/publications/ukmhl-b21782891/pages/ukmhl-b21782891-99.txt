91 DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE VEINS. NEW GROWTHS IN VEINS. 1606a. A Vena Cava Inferior which is almost entirely occupied by a sarcomatous growth. The tumour, which filled the right external and internal iliac veins, has so far infiltrated the vein-wall at its lower part that it cannot be separated. In the upper two-thirds of its course, however, the growth lies quite freely within the vein, and terminates in a tapering extremity at a point which corresponded with the lower border of the liver. The right external iliac artery was compressed but not infil- trated by the growth, which was attached to each side of the right ilium, ischium, and pubes. The glands along the side of the vena cava are infiltrated with sarcoma. Microscopically the growth is a chondrifying sarcoma. 1889 From an unmarried woman, aged 22, who first complained of pain over the posterior part of the right iliac bone three months before her death. Six weeks after the pain was felt a swelling was noticed in the right iliac fossa. Her right leg was flexed, and she suffered the most intense agony, which was increased on defajcation. She had retention of urine, and three days before her death there was cedema of the right leg. Sections of the growth are preserved in Series Iv., No. 133. See Female Surgical Register^ vol. iii. (1888), No. 1900. 1608a. The Left Kidney and a portion of the Left Lobe of the Liver, from a case in which the right kidney had been removed. A ligature has been passed round the right renal vessels at the point where the right renal vein opens into the inferior vena cava. A portion of the inferior vena cava has been included in the ligature. A thrombus fills the entire vena cava. 1885

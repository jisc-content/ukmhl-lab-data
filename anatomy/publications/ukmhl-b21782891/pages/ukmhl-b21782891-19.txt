DISEASES OF BONES. 11 The patient, a healthy lad, had received a slight blow on the shin from a fir-conc. Five days afterwards the leg was acutely painful, the skin over the tibia being swollen and very tender. A month later the limb was amputated. Presented by Gregory White, Esq. 198a. A Sequestrum removed from the Thigh four years after a Compound Fracture. 1885 M., fet. 20. The sequestrum had given no trouble during the four years until about a week before its removal. See Male Surgical Eegister, vol. iii. (1885), No. 2027. 200a. Portion of a First Metatarsal Bone, which was introduced between the ends of an un-united Fracture of a Tibia. The bone was engrafted on the 20th of January, and was removed as a sequestrum on the lOtJi of June in the same year. Its edges are thinned and eroded, the periosteum has disappeared, and the whole thickness of the bone has died. 1889 From a man, aged 37 years, who had an un-united fracture of the left tibia for eight months previous to the time of grafting the bone. See Male Surgical Register, vol. iii. (1889), No. 86. 202a. Portions of the Compact Layer of the Parietal and Frontal Bones, which exfoliated after a wound of the scalp. 1890 From a man, aged 4(5. See Colston Ward Booh (July, 1874), No. 3. 202b. Portions of the Compact Layer of the Frontal Bone, which separated after an extensive Compound Depressed Fracture of the skull. The lowest and largest fragment shows the marks of the saw, used soon after the admission of the patient to relieve the compression caused by the depressed fracture. 1890 From a boy, who ultimately recovered, though he suffered for some time from a hernia cerebri. See Colston Ward Booh (1881), s.v. A. Aves. 202c. A Portion of the Outer Table of the Parietal Bone, which separated after an extensive injury to the scalp. 1890 From a case under the care of Mr. Luther Holden, in Colston Ward. 210a. One Half of the Upper Part of a Right Femur which has been sawn through longitudinally. The great trochanter is hollowed out and contains in its centre an oval sequestrum, measuring more than an inch in its long diameter : it is covered with soft granulations, and the cavity where it hes is lined by the same material: a small sinus led down from the top of the trochanter to the sequestrum: there is another abscess cavity filled by curdy pus in the lower part of the neck. 1892 From a patient, aged 50. Forty years previously she had been under the care of Sir William Lawrence for disease of the hip-joint. See Female Surgical Begister, vol. ii. (1889), No. 2586.* 214a. The Bones forming a right Knee-Joint. The tibia is placed at a right angle to the femur, and- their inner condyles are united by bone. The patella is ankylosed to the outer condyle of the femur, a considerable portion of which has been destroyed by caries and necrosis. 1881 (In Case F.) 226a. Portion of the Temporal and Occipital Bones, showing the results of Necrosis of the Mastoid Process. The temporal was trephined shortly before death. 1885 (In Case F.)

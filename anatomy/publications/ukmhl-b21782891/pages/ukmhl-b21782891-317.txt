CASTS AND MODELS OF DISEASED AND INJURED PARTS. 309 33a. Cast of the Knee of a man, in whom the tibia and fibula could be completely dislocated backwards. The convexity of the cast, which was made while the man threw some of his weight on the limb, corresponds to the popliteal space. 1882 From a man, who, three years previously, met with an accident to his knee (? dislocation), for which he was kept in splints for six weeks. The joint was subsequently stiff, and only commenced to yield six months before he came under notice, at which time he was completely unable to walk, on account of the leg bowing backwards. After amputation, from which he recovered, it was found that the knee was extremely affected with rheumatoid-arthritis. It is preserved in Series ii.. No. 691a. 33b.

358 ORGANS OF GENERATION IN THE FEMALE DURING PREGNANCY, ETC. the ring. In this specimen the contraction ring is identical with the internal os, and the cervix has been stretched to a length of three inches. There is no circular or large sinus at the internal os. 1887 A drawing is preserved in Series xxxviii., No. 1004. Presented by W. S. A. Griffith, M.D. 1237a. The Cervix and Upper Portion, of the Vagina, showing the usual condition of the vaginal portion of the uterus a few days after delivery. It is divided into two parts, the upper of which is the anterior. The cervical canal is a flattened channel, one inch and a quarter wide. There are numerous small lacerations, one at each end extending to the vaginal attachment. Death occurred on the seventh day after parturition. 1890 See Medical Post-Murtem Register, vol. xvii., p. 6. 1238a. A Section tlirough an Uterus, which is in a condition of subinvolution. 1890 1251a. Umbilical Cord, with an unusually complex knot or series of knots. 1885 Presented by C. B. Gabb, Esq. 1293a. A Portion of a Placenta and of the Membranes. Near the junction of the two is a small raised oval white patch. This is the remains of the umbilical vesicle. There is a slender filament attached to one extremity. 1891 1299a. A Portion of the Placenta and Membranes, showing a velamentous insertion of the cord. About five inches of the cord traverses the membranes before it reaches the edge of the placenta. The vessels of the cord have the usual twisted arrange- ment in this portion as well as in the free part. The membranes have ruptured by the side of the cord. 1888 Presented by W. S. A. Griffith, M.D. 1299b. A Battledore Placenta. On the foetal surface, near the centre, are two thin- walled flattened oval cysts. 1890 1299c. A Placenta, the vessels of which have been injected, the umbilical arteries with blue, and the vein with red material. The cord is attached at the margin, forming a battledore placenta. The injection, which is seen easily through the three vessels on the foetal surface, is not seen at all on the uterine side. 1891 1307a. An Umbilical Cord of unusual length, but of normal structure. Before it was put into spirit it measured sixty-three inches from the umbilicus to its insertion into the placenta. 1886 Presented by W. Woolcombe, Esq. 1307b. An Umbilical Cord, showing irregular twisting, from a child born at full time. The foetal half of the cord is seen to be much more twisted than the placental portion. The placental extremity is indicated by three styles, which are inserted into the arteries, one of which has already bifurcated. 1887 1308a. The Egg-Case, or Nidamental Capsule of a Shark. 1886 1308b. The Ovisac and Egg of the Common Dogfish (Scyllium canicula). The germinal vesicle is just beginning to segment. 1887 Presented by T. W.

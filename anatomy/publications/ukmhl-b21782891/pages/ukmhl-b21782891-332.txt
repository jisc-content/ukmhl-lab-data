TERATOLOGICAL CATALOGUE. SERIES 1. ABIOEIAI OOIDITIOIS OP THE AXIS. 3400a. The Decidua Vera and Foetal Meraliranes enclosing an Embryo, in which, as a result of non-development of the placental stalk, the embryo remains attached by a broad base to the placenta. The condition illustrates the normal condition seen in the rabbit's embryo at the tenth day. 1888 CLASS II.—DUPLICITY. 3402a. The Articulated Skeleton of a Two-headed Calf, with lateral curvature of the lumbar spine, and a spina bifida of the lumbo-sacral and caudal regions. 1889 Presented by Ernest Noad, Esq. POSTERIOR DICHOTOMY. 3408a. A Monstrous Pig. The head and neck, and the thoracic organs are single. Two forelegs are normally situated, the other two project upwards from the scapular region. The abdominal organs are double, and there are two backbones. The hind-quarters are distinct. 1885 Presented by Crawford Duncan, Esq. SUB-CLASS IL—HOMOLOGOUS UNION, (a.) Prozygosis. 3410a. Female Twin Foetuses united by their faces along the median line, and by their thoracic laminai above the umbilicus. They constitute the variety of homo- logous union known as Iniops. 1886 The faces are fused in such a manner that two lateral faces are formed out of four halves. Of these faces, one differs from that of an ordinary infant only in its greater breadth, whilst the other is a mere rudiment. The less-developed face has a single median eye, above which is a kind of proboscis measuring two-thirds of an inch in length. Beneath the eye is a papilla of skin, with a small central aperture, through which a probe can be passed into the mouth of the opposite face. Beneath this papilla and aperture are two ears, fused by their lobes, but otherwise distinct. The other two ears are separate, and bear their normal relation to the well-formed face. The brains, like the faces, were fused, but they were not in a condition to admit of a detailed exainination.

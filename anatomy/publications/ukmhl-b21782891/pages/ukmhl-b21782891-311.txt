SEEIE8 LIV. COIfCRETIOIS FROM THE CIRCTJLATOET AID OTHER OR&AIfS. NASAL CALCULUS. 303a. An irregalarly square Eliinolith, measuring nearly an inch across. Chemical examination shows that it consists of a mixture of calcium carbonate and phosphate. It weighs thirty-three grains, and appears to have been formed round a piece of rag, which has served as a nucleus. 1887 The concretion was removed from the inferior nasal meatus of a girl, aged 24, who gave an indistinct history of having had a foreign body in her nose for twenty years. See Transactions of the Pathological Society, vol. xxxviii., p. 321. 303b. A Piece of Rag, removed from the nostril of a child, aged six years. The fragment had been in situ for about eighteen months, during which time the child constantly suffered from a foetid discharge through its nose. It is coated with a deposit of earthy salts, and would, no doubt, in time, have become a rhinolith. 1889 303c. Two Foreign Bodies, consisting of a metal shirt stud and a piece of cotton fringe, removed from the nostril of a child, where they are stated to have remained for six years. When first removed, they were matted together by dried secretion, and, when touched with a probe, gave the sensation of a piece of necrosed bone. 1890 See St. Bartholomew's Hospital Bejjorts, vol. xxvi., p. 271.

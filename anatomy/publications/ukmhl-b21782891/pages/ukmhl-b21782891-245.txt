237 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. 2854a. A Bladder and Prostate. Occupying the whole of the latter is a large, soft sarcomatous tumour, parts of which project into the cavity of the bladder in the form of pedunculated growths of varying size. The bladder is somewhat hyper- trophied. 1883 From a man, aged 21 years, who was admitted, to the Eoyal Free Hospital for retention of urine. No tumour could at that time be felt per rectum, and his previous health had been good. He died in three weeks, after much ha3maturia. A post-mortem examination showed greatly diluted ureters, with numerous small abscesses in the kidneys, but no secondary growths. On microscopical examination, the tumour was found to consist of round and spindle cells. See description of case in the Pathological Sooiety^s Transactions, vol. xxxiv., p. 145. Presented by Dr. Samuel West. 2854b. A Section through the Bladder, Prostate, and Kectum, showing a primary cancer of the prostate which has invaded the bladder and rectum. The trigone of the bladder is ulcerated in its whole extent, and the ulceration has extended along the rectum as low as the anus. By the growth of the jn'ostatic tumour in front, and by a large mass of new growth behind, the rectum is so narrowed as to be almost impervious. Microscopically, the growth in the prostate is a typical scirrhous carcinoma ; some of the cells are columnar, and resemble those of Lieberkiihn's follicles. 1889 From a gentleman, aged 70, who first consulted a surgeon, about two years before his death, on account of a large quantity of blood and pus which he passed in his urine.

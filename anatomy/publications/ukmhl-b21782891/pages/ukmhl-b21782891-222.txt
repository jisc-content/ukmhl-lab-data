Presented by T. Swinford Edwards, Esq. 214 DISEASES AND INJURIES TO NERVES. 2566a. A Hand, deformed as the result of an injury to the median nerve. The fingers are doused up and claw-like, the nails are curved longitudinally and trans- versely ; the} are fibrous, ridged, and furrowed. The phalangeal joints are stiffened in a position of flexion ; their cartilages are thinned, and in the articulation between the second and third phalanges of the ring-finger there is true bony ankylosis. The muscles are not wasted, but, during life, the skin of the digits was smooth and glossy. About one inch above the wrist-joint the median nerve is enlarged, and embedded in its substance may be seen a small foreign bodyâ€”a piece of metal. 1884 The patient was a soldier, aged 32, who received a gunshot wound on the front of the wrist by a splintered ramrod, two years before he came under notice. The hand had slowly assumed its present condition, and sensation in tlie median distribution was everywhere impaired. The forearm was wasted and hyper;Bsthetic. 2566b. Hand, showing a Cyst on the deep branch of Ulnar Nerve. The cyst contains synovial fluid ; it is connected with one of the carpal joints by a narrow process which runs up over the carpus, 1884

DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES. 137 2043a. The Duodenum, from a case ot" poisoning by corrosive sublimate. The intestinal wall is blackened, and at its upper part is completely ulcerated tbrougli. From the rounded appearances of the edges of the ulcer, however, it appears that it was not due to corrosion, but to some more chronic process, which resulted in the adhesion of the duodenum to the neighbouring tissues, thereby preventing perforation. 1887 From a man, aged 76, who committed suicide by swallowing a large quantity of corrosive sublimate in a glass of water. He died collapsed five hours after the dose. The stomach is preserved in Series xvii., No. 1949a, and a drawing of it in Series Ivii., No. 389. See British 3Iedical Jtmnial, vol. ii., 1885, p. 599. Presented by C. Rotherham Walker, M.D. 2044a. A portion of the Small Intestine, showing the changes which have occurred as a result of carbolic acid poisoning. The mucous membrane is much swollen, and has a velvety appearance, owing to the enlargement of the villi and the effusion of lymph. (Cf. No. 1949c.) 1888 The stomach and duodenum from the same case are preserved in the Huntcrian Museum, Nos. 238(;a and b. The patient only lived for three hours after taking the poison.

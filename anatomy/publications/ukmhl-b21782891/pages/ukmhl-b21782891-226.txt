DISEASES AND INJURIES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES. 218 2634a. Posterior Half of the Right Eyeball, showing a dark-coloured tumour springing from the choroid, and pushing the retina in front of it. The growth arises from the posterior portion of the orbit. Microscopically, it consists of a round-celled melanotic sarcoma. 1888 From a woman, aged 52, whose globe was extirpated for the relief of chronic glaucoma. See Alexandra Ward Booh for 1886, No. 1840, and for 1887, No. 2669. 2636a. Melanotic Sarcoma springing from the ciliary processes. 1884 2636b. An Eye, showing a Melanotic Sarcoma springing from the choroid, and involving the ciliary processes. 1884 Microscopic examination shows that it consists of small spindle cells. Details of the case will be found in the Male Register Booh of the Ophthalmic Wards, case No. 403, 1884. 2637a- A Segment of the Posterior Half of the Eyeball, showing a small, round, and deeply pigmented melanotic sarcoma growing from the choroid. In its growth the tumour has detached and pushed forward the retina. Microscopically, the growth is a spindle-celled sarcoma, containing an unusually large amount of pigment. 1888 The growth of the tumour gave rise to chronic glaucoma, which culminated in an acute attack. A section of the tumour is preserved in Series Iv., No. 489. Presented by Sir Henry Wentworth Acland, K.C.B. 2640a. A Calcareous Lens, removed from the anterior chamber. It had probably been dislocated for many years previous to its removal, but had only recently been displaced in front of the iris. 1887 From a boy, aged 16, who had been blind from birth with his right eye. Three days before admission to the Hospital a round yellow object appeared in his eye, and he suffered intense pain. A drawing of the eye, before the removal of the lens, is preserved in Series Ivii., No. 752. See Ojj/ithalmie Ward Booh for 1886, No. 3090. 2641a. A Crystalline Lens of such an unusually dark colour that it maybe classed as an example of the rare form of " black cataract." Chemical examination shows that it is free from iron pigment. 1886 It was removed from a woman, a3;ed 43, who had always been myopic. She believed that she had received a blow upon her right eye sixteen years before admission to the Hospital. After the blow the eye gradually became dim. When seen, both eyeballs were prominent, and there was a dark striated opacity in the right. The right fundus could not be illuminated. The patient had cataract of the left eye. The right lens was removed without iridectomy. See Proceedings of the Ophthalmological Society, vol. v. (1885), p. 111. 2641b. A Crystalline Lens, removed by operation. The nucleus is sufficiently dark in colour for it to be classed as a " black cataract." 1891 See Albert Edward Ward Book, 1890, No. 8111. 2642a. A Transverse Section through the Eye of a Dog, to show the lens in an advanced condition of cataract. It is densely opaque and nacreous. The opposite eye was equally affected, and the animal had been blind for some time before bis death. 1889 Presented by Sir Dyce Duckworth, M.D. 2651a. A Human Eye, divided transversely to show a large flake of metal which is embedded in the outer side of the eyeball. All the structures of the eye are destroyed. 1886 On admission, the patient had a vertical wound of a quarter of an inch long on the outer side of the cornea, an<l extending into the ciliary region. There was prolapse of the iris. The eye was removed three weeks after the injury on account of the appearance of sympa- thetic irritation. The patient made a good recovery. â€¢ See Albert Edward Ward Book, 1885, No. 3210.

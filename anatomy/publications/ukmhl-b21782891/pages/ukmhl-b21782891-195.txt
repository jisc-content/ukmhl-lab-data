187 THEIR PELVES, AND THE URBTEES. 2384a. The Left Kidney, whose substance is transformed into a large number of thin-walled cysts. The cysts vary in size from a small shot to a pigeon's egg. They were filled with a yellow viscid and transparent fluid. 1888 From a married woman, aged 59, who suffered from ascites. Both kidneys were equally affected. See Blartlia Ward Booh for 1887, No. 42. 2384b. The Right Kidney, from the same case as the preceding. It shows the same changes as those which have already been described. 1888 2386a. A Kidney of a Pig, which has undergone extreme cystic degeneration. Little or no kidney substance remains. The ureter is also very much dilated. 1890 Presented by Mr. Streeter. 2389a. The Kidneys of a child, into the substance of which considerable hajmorrhage has occurred. The effused blood lies beneath the lining membrane of the pelvis of the kidney. A similar condition was found in the bladder. 1891 From a child who died of tubercular meningitis. The bladder is preserved in Series xxix., No. 2405a, and drawings of the kidneys and bladder, when recent, in Series Ivii., Nos. 637 and 644. See Male Surgical Register, vol. v. (1890), No. 679. BLOOD-CAST OF THE URETER. 23891D. A cylindrical blood-clot, measuring fourteen inches in length, and forming a cast of the ureter ; it was passed from the urethra during micturition. 1893 The patient was a man, aged 54, who suffered from malignant disease of the kidney. Persistent and profuse htematuria had existed for several months. The left kidney was subsequently removed by operation, and was found to be the seat of round-celled sarcoma. See 3Iale Surgical Register, vol. ii. (1893), No. 50. 2390a. A Cancerous Growth in the Right Kidney. The new tissue has infiltrated the whole of the organ, which is enlarged to the size of a fist. The glandular substance has almost entirely disappeared, except for traces of the calyces. In the pelvis was a ragged calculus about half an inch in length. The new growth, when examined by the microscope, was found to be a carcinoma with a very extensive fibrous stroma. - 1886 From a woman, aged 48. There were cancerous deposits in the liver and lungs. See Medical Post-Mortem Book, vol. xi., p. 341. 2390b. A Section of a large and soft Cancerous Mass, involving the Right Kidney. The organ retains somewhat of its outline, but it is greatly enlarged. When fresh it measured nine inches in length, four inches in width, and three inches in thickness. In places the surface is nodular. The tnmour is almost pulpy in consistency ; it is contained within the capsule of the kidney, and involves about a third of the lower portion of the organ. The ureter opens into a sort of cavity formed by the breaking- down of the tumour. Microscopically, the growth is a carcinoma, the constituent cells exactly resembling those in the renal tubes. The matrix is alveolar. 1887 From a patient, aged 49, who had suffered for a year from hsematuria with a gnawing pain in her right lumbar and inguinal regions. An exploratory operation was performed, but it was deemed unadvisable to remove the tumour. The patient died a fortnight later. See Female Surgical Register, vol. v. (1885), No. 2263. 2390c. A Section through a Kidney, infiltrated with a carcinoma which is undergoing colloid degeneration. The growth extends as a pyramidal mass through the whole thickness of the organ from the capsule to the calyx. 1888 From a woman, aged 21, who had been ailing for eleven months before her death. She presented all the symptoms of cerebral tumour, but there was no evidence before death of any hepatic or renal disease. The patient had had syphilis. See 3Iary Ward Book for 1887, s. v. Maude Pocock. The liver is preserved in Series xxiâ€ž No. 2217b. o

299 UKINARY CALCULI. From a gentleman, aged 77, who, ^^ntil a year before their passage, had no reason to suspect that he had either renal or vesical malady. A catheter was passed on account of senile enlargement of the prostate ; cystitis was set up, and in a few days the calculi were passed per urethram. He had no renal colic. Presented by Dr. Gripper. 235a. An Oval Uric Acid Calculus, measuring one and a quarter inches in its long diameter, and three-quarters of an inch across. It was removed by urethral dilata- tion from a girl, aged three j'ears. There was some bleeding from laceration. 1888 Presented by T. Odling, Esq. 237a. A Calculus, removed after death from the Bladder of a Horse, aged seventeen years. The surface is indented and slightly irregular (resembling somewhat the convolutions on the surface of the brain). On section it shows a -well-marked con- centric arrangement of its layers ; it is apparently composed of the same material throughout. It is light and porous in structure. Its transverse diameter measures five inches and three-quarters, and its weight, when fresh, was five pounds and three-quarters. The chemical composition was foimd to be mainly ammonio-magnesium phos- phate. It also contains a little calcium phosphate and some undetermined organic substance. 1891 Presented by J. F. Steedman, Esq. X

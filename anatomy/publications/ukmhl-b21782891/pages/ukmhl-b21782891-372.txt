364 INVERTEBKATA. GEOUP E.—ECHINIDEA. 1466a. A Specimen of Spatangus. The mouth and anus are both eccentric. The ambulacral regions are not very obvious in the ventral region, but are continued into a well-marked star on the dorsal region. 1889 Presented by T. W, Shore, M.D. HOLOTHUROIDEA. 1468a. An Adult Synapta. The animal has a vermiform body, a row of tentacles about the mouth, and five ambulacral lines without pedicles. 1889 146813. Skin of Synapta, showing the skeletal elements, consisting of anchor-like bodies attached to perforated plates. 1889 [In the Microscopical Cabinet.] Presented by T. W. Shore, M.D, CLASS II.—SCOLECIDA. VERMES. 1469a. Sections of Distoma hepaticum, showing the intestinal cEcca and the genera- tive glands embedded in the general parenchyma, surrounded by the muscular and ectodermic layers. 1889 [In the Microscopical Cabinet,] Presented by T. W. Shore, M.D. 1470a. Liver Flukes from a Sheep. 1884 1471a.

The Head and a Portion of the Strobila of a Taenia mediocanellata. The portion of the worm here preserved measures eight feet in length. It was obtained from the body of a man who died of volvulus, and in whose intestine were found the Ascaris lumbricoides, 1488a, and the Trichocephalus dispar preserved in 1491a, 1474a. Taenia Solium (the common tape-worm). The head is supported by pins. By the aid of a simple magnifying-glass two of the suckers can be distinctly seen. The entire scolex measures nineteen feet. It was expelled after a single dose of filix mas. 1888 1476a. A Microscopical Preparation of a fertilised Proglottis of Tsenia Solium, to show the great size of the ovary. 1886 1476b. Two Proglottides of the Tsenia Mediocanellata in the unimpregnated con- dition, prepared for microscopic examination. 1888 Presented by T. W. Shore, M.D. 1479a. Head and Proximal Segments of Bothriocephalus latus. The head has a chink-like aperture on either side ; there are no hooks or suckers. 1885 1483a.

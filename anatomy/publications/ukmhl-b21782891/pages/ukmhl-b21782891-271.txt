DEFORMITIES AND TUMOURS OF THE PELVIS. 263 3117a- Malacosteaii Pelvis. The left innominate bone was less affected by the disease than the right ; it is therefore less deformed. 1884 The specimen was obtained from the body of a woman, aged 67, who died without any symptoms of osteomalacia. Presented by W. S. A. Griffith, M.D. 3122a. The Pelvis of an adult female, in which, as the result of increased curvature of the spine, the brim is inclined so as to form nearly a right angle with the horizon. 1886 3126a. An oblique Pelvis of Naegele, with the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrai attached. The synostosis is on the right side of the pelvis, which is flattened, and the symphysis pubis is opposite the middle of the left ala of the sacrum. The right ala of the sacrum is imperfectly developed. The right ilium is united to the three upper segments of the sacrum corresponding to the normal articulation on the left side. There is no sign of a joint below or in front, bnt above and posteriorly the line of junction is distinct. 1886 Brim. Outlet. Conjugate 3.75 inches.

In her last labour the vertex presented in the first position. She died of peritonitis on the eighteenth day after delivery. There was no history of any disease occurring during infancy or childhood, and she was not known by her friemls to be in any way deformed. See Transact ions of the Ohstetrical Society, vol. xxviii. (1886), p. 84. Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxi., p. 168. 3129a. An Oblique Rachitic Pelvis, the sacrum being tilted to the left side. The following are the measurements :— Exterior. Brim.

The left iliac bone is smaller than the right, and measures a quarter of an inch less along its crest. 1884 The patient was a woman, aged 48. She had no lateral curvature, but the left leg was one inch shorter than the right, being the more curved and deformed. The obliquity of the pelvis is probably due to this condition. See description of case by Dr. Griffith in the Olstetrical Society's Transactions for November 7th, 1883. 3129b. A slightly oblique, flattened, rachitic Pelvis, from a wontian upon whom Porro's operation was performed. Diameters—Conjugate, 2 inches ; transverse, 5 inches ; right oblique, 4^ inches ; left oblique, 4^ inches ; antero-posterior of outlet, 4J inches ; transverse of outlet, 4 inches ; posterior spines, 2 inches ; crests, 9^ inches ; spines, 10 inches.

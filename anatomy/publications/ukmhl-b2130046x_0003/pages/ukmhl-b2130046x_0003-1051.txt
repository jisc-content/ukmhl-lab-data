949 PHARYNX. part of the pharynx its free surface presents numerous slight elevations occasioned by the glands which are situated beneath it; these in- deed are scattered over the whole pharynx, but are especially abundant at its upper part, where they form a compact lamina between its mus- culo-membranous tunic and the mucous mem- brane, opening upon the surface of the latter by slender ducts. 5. Vessels and nerves. — The bloodvessels distributed to the pharynx are derived from several sources, but chiefly from an especial trunk, viz. the ascending or inferior pharyngeal artery; this vessel arises from the posterior part of the external carotid, often its first branch, near the bifurcation of the common carotid ; it ascends to the base of the skull, lying close by the side of the pharynx and upon the rectus capitis anticus major muscle, sending off nu- merous small branches, which, intermingling with the pharyngeal plexus of nerves, are dis- tributed to the constrictors and stylo-pharyn- geus, to the velum, arches of the palate and tonsil, ending in minute ramifications on the mucous membrane; the next most regular sup- ply is from the inferior palatine and tonsilhtic branches of the facial artery; the internal max- illary, lingual and superior thyroid vessels con- tribute an irregular supply of small and unim- portant twigs. The veins form a considerable plexus, the pharyngeal venous plexus, which is produced chiefly by the frequent anastomoses of the pharyngeal vein with the small branches that accompany the inferior palatine and tonsil- iitic arteries, and with some of the commencing twigs of the internal maxillary vein; the pha- ryngeal vein, which receives the blood from this plexus, opens, either singly or in conjunc- tion with the lingual, into the internal jugular vein ; of the lymphatics, but little is known; they probably enter the chain of glands which lie along the outer side of the carotid sheath. An intricate plexus of nerves, the pharyngeal plexus, is situated upon the sides of the pha- rynx, the branches being particularly numerous upon the middle constrictor muscle near its origin ; it is of some length, and subject to variety in the number of its filaments in diffe- rent subjects; it interlaces with the ramifica- tions of the arterial twigs from the ascending pharyngeal, and derives its branches from the three portions of the eighth pair of nerves and from the superior cervical ganglion of the sym- pathetic ; the glosso-pharyngeal nerve sends downwards two or more branches to the plexus; one of these I have seen to join the superior laryngeal nerve ; they are given off just before the nerve winds round the lower border of the stylo-pharyngeus muscle; subsequently one or two branches penetrate this muscle to be distri- buted to the pharyngeal mucous membrane ; the pneumo-gastric detaches one or two pharyn- geal branches; the larger one appears in a great measure formed by a branch from the spinal accessory nerve ; these join with the filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal; the superior laryn- geal nerve by its external branch also contri- butes a few filaments ; lastly, from the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, twigs are derived, which, communicating with those already mentioned, complete this intricate plexus ; the branches from it are distributed to the pharyngeal walls, to the soft palate, and stylo-pharyngeus muscles. The digastric branch of the facial nerve and the lingual or its de- scending branch are described as sometimes communicating with this plexus : for the more minute anatomy of these nerves see Par Vagum, Glosso-pharyngeal Nerve, and Spinal Accessory. Mouth, (Gr. 0-TOju.a; Lat. os; Fr. bouche.)—■ The mouth is an oval cavity, symmetrical, and situated at the lower part of the face, below the nasal fossae, between the jaws, and in front of the pharynx, with which it communicates by a posterior opening, called the isthmus fau- cium, and has also a dilatable aperture ante- riorly guarded by the lips: it is liable to con- siderable alterations of form and size, from complete closure to a state of extreme exten- sion, when it represents a quadrangular py- ramid with the base in front: the greatest change occurs in its vertical diameter from the movements of the lower jaw; in it are per- formed the various functions of mastication, tasting, partly that of deglutition, and it is subseivient also to the production of articulate sounds. The mouth or buccal cavity is bounded both laterally and anteriorly by the alveolar borders of the upper and lower maxillary bones and teeth, the lips completing the boundary in front and the cheeks laterally: above it is roofed in by the arched palate and more pos- teriorly by the velum palati ; interiorly the tongue forms its floor. In the examination of these boundaries the reader is referred to the articles Face and Teeth for the description of the maxillary bones and teeth. The lips (labia) are two moveable curtains placed in front of the mouth, presenting be- tween them when applied to each other a transverse slit convertible by their separation into a more or less considerable opening, which constitutes the anterior aperture of the buccal cavity : the lips are united at the lateral limits of this fissure to form the commissures or angles; the anterior surface of the upper lip, which usually projects a little beyond the lower, is covered with hair in the adult male, and exhibits in the median line a vertical groove continued to its free border from the septum of the nose: two ridges bound this furrow on either side, and from thence the upper lip passes off laterally to the cheek, insensibly in the young and plump face, but otherwise a line of demarcation is produced by an oblique fold of the skin which descends from the side of the nose to near the commissure of the lips on either side of the face: the anterior surface of the lower lip descends more or less abruptly backwards to the chin, divided from it by a transverse groove : it is covered with hair usu- ally at the centre only, and slightly bulging near its free border shelves off gradually to the sides of the face: the free borders are the thickest parts of the lips, their large develope- ment forming a characteristic feature in the Ne£to; in their outline they differ, presenting:

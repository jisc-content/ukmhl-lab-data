ORGANIC ANALYSIS. 809 22.3 gvs. out of 30.6, shewing the quantity of sugar to have amounted to only 8.3 grs., instead of about 24.5 grs. The foregoing experiment shews the impossibility of obtaining an accurate result if the solution be evaporated in air even at temperatures considerably below 200°. Diabetic sugar, in fact, loses by this treatment 5 equiva- lents of water, and becomes converted into a spe- cies of caramel, insusceptible of fermentation. To proceed, however, with the analysis: The salts were found by incineration to amount to 3.09 per 1000 parts of urine. To determine the quantity of sugar, 250 grs. of the secretion were mixed with yeast and placed in a tall graduated jar capable of con- taining 25 cubic inches; filled with mercury, and inverted in a basin holding that metal, The barometer stood at 30.33 The thermometer 72° F. Air in the jar, which accidentally entered during the act of inversion 1.00 cub. in. Quantity of fluid 1.45 cub. in. Exterior level of the mercury 12.33 inches below the interior level. In three days fermentation was complete. The barometer then stood at.. . . 30.34 The thermometer 80c Exterior level of the mercury 1.14 below that of the interior. The quantity of gas amounted to 19.3 cub.in. adding the bulk of the fluid ... 1.45 We obtain total gas 20.75 Correcting for pressure we obtain 30 : 30.34 — 1.14 : : 20.75 : x {— 20.1828) Correcting this again for the temperature, 528 : 508 : : 20.1828 : x (= 19.41) Subjecting the air which was in the jar at the commencement of the experiment to the same corrections, in order to deduct, we ob- tain For the temperature 520 : 508 : : 1 : For the pressure 30 : 30.33—12.33 : 19.41—0.58 of carbonic acid.

The urea was found by a separate analysis ; 500 grs. were evaporated in vacuo, the residue treated with hot absolute alcohol (f.^fs). It was allowed to cool in order to deposit part of the sugar, then decanted; this was repeated three or four times. The alcoholic solutions were evaporated to dryness, re-dissolved in water, and treated with oxalic acid and sub- sequently with chalk, observing the precautions already enumerated: 1.06 grs. of prismatic needles of nearly pure urea were obtained. 500 : 1000 : : 1.06 : x (= 2.12) urea. As a comparative experiment 500 grs. were evaporated by the water-bath and nitric acid substituted for the oxalic; only traces of crystals of nitrate of urea were thus obtained; a con- x (=0.9769) : 0.9769 : x (= 0.586) 18 83 corrected volume elusive proof of the superior delicacy of the first method. The syrupy residue after exhaustion with ab- solute alcohol was treated with rectified spirit as long as any thing dissolved : 2.15 grs. of saline matters, uric acid, mucus, and matters soluble in water only were left. Hydrochloric acid left only 0.04 of uric acid and mucus. 500 : 1000 : : 0.04 : x (= 0.08) uric acid, Src.

The fluid was rather turbid, feebly alkaline, and of sp. gr. 1013.1. It was found to contain 30.2 per 1000 of solid matter, of which 9.17 were salts and 21.03 organic vo- latile matters. 500 grs. evaporated to dryness, and the residue finely powdered, taking care that none of the particles were lost (by placing the mortar on a large sheet of paper, and co- vering the mouth of it likewise with paper). It was treated with boiling water and washed as long as any thing dissolved. The insoluble portion collected on a filter, dried and weighed, amounted to 3.1 grs. 500 : 1000 : : 3.1 : x (= 6.2) albumen, with traces of uric acid. The filtered liquid was evaporated to dry- ness, and treated with alcohol and nitric acid for urea in the usual manner: the urea per 1000 = 4.72 grs.

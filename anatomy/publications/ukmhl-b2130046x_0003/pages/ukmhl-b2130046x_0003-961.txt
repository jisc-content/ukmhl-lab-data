861 PACHYDERM ATA. Fig. 470. Vertical section of the skull of a young Boar. Fig. in. Occipital bone of a young Boar, shewing its division into four pieces. In the ahove three figures the parts indicated are as follows :—a, a, frontals ; b, b, parietals ; c, c, 2, c 2, e 3, occipital; d, temporal ; e, lateral processes of occipital hone; f, sphenoid; g, supra-orbital plate of os frontis; /(, os lacrymale ; i, jugal bone ; k, superior maxillary ; /, inter- maxillary ; m, nasal; n, inferior maxilla; 0, ossified nasal cartilage ; p, palatine. turbinated laminae are very large, so that the delicacy of the sense with which they are con- nected is evidently only inferior to that of the carnivorous quadrupeds. The sphenoid occupies the same position as in the skull of Man, and in the hog tribe is very similar in its shape and the general ar- rangement of its processes to the human. In the Elephant the anterior and posterior clinoid processes are but slightly developed, so that the base of the cranium internally has a very flat appearance, whilst externally, such is the enor- mous developement of the sphenoidal cells, that they stretch on each side beneath the aire minores almost along their whole length and mask the pterygoid processes, so as to give a very peculiar appearance to the base of the cranium. The bones of the face are remarkable for their massive developement, but as their posi- tion is sufficiently indicated in the next wood- cuts, it would be useless to particularize them further. Ribs and sternum.-—The thoracic cavity throughout all the Pachydermatous genera is enormous in proportion to the great bulk and excessive weight of the viscera. The ribs, in fact, are continued backwards almost to the pelvis, and from their extraordinary size and Fig. 472. Skull of American Tapir. Fig. 473. Skull of Sus Larvatus. Letters as in figure 4o'5.

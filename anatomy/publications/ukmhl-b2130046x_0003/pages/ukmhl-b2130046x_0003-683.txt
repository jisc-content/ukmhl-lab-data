The maximum is found in the table at between 16 and 20; but, as Dr. Reid states, it is plain that the apparent excess of weight at this period over that for the next forty years must have arisen from sources of fallacy incidental to insufficient data. And in the (Human Anatomy. group between 40 and 50, Dr. Reid states that some brains much below the average weight were found, so as to leave no doubt that the diminution in the average weight in that group was attributable to that circumstance. A decided diminution in the average weight of the brain was noticed in females above 60 years of age; but, among the males, this was not apparent until a later period. Upon this point Professor Reid makes the following judi- cious observation, which I am anxious to quote as according with the views I have ex- pressed at page 642 respecting liquid effusions. " We certainly did expect," he says, " also to find a similar diminution in the average weight of the male brain above 60 years of age, for we are perfectly satisfied, as the tables contain- ing the individual facts will shew, that we more frequently meet with a greater quantity of serum under the arachnoid and in the lateral ventricles in old people than in those in the prime of life. We are also satisfied from an examination of the notes we have taken at the time the brains were examined, that a certain degree of atrophy of the convolutions of the brain over the anterior lobes, marked by the greater width of the sulci, was more common in old than in young persons. We have, how- ever, frequently remarked these appearances in the brains of people in the prime of life who had been for some time addicted to excessive indulgence in ardent spirits." The ratio between the weight of the body and that of the brain is greater in early age than at the subsequent periods. The following pro- portions were obtained byTiedemann, in infants just born. In two boys the proportion of the brain to the body was as 1: 5.15 and 1 : 6.63, and in two girls as 1 : 6.29 and 1 : 6.83. The following table gives Professor Reid's results from the examination of 92 bodies. Table IV.

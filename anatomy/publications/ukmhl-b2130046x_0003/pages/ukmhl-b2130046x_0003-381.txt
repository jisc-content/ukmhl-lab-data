361 MILK. do not mention sugar of milk as a constituent, and in this respect agree with MM. Chevallier and Henry, who do not mention it in their analysis of the colostrum of the cow. Donne has observed a microscopic difference between the globules of the colostrum and those of milk. He states the colostrum globule to be made up of small granules united together, or enclosed in a transparent envelope. They dis- appear in ether, and when the fluid is evapora- ted, small tufts of acicular crystals are observed. Donne traced these globules in milk secreted twenty days after parturition. M. Giiterbock has also observed these compound globules, and says he could detect the transparent membrane after the ether had dissolved the enclosed granules. M. Mandl has not been able to detect these compound globules, and believes them to be made up of agglomerated milk glo- bules. The following is the result of a com- parative analysis of colostrum and true milk by F. Simon. Colostrum. Common milk. Casein .... 4 per cent. 3.5 per cent. Sugar 7 „ 4.7 „ Butter 5 „ 2.3 ,, I shall now proceed to the consideration of the milk of the human subject, which differs in some respects from that obtained from the cow; its general characters are, however, iden- tical. One of the principal differences to be observed consists in the caseous matter of human milk not being so universally preci- pitable by acids as that which exists in the secretion from the cow. Meggenhofen found but three out of fifteen specimens which he examined that could be precipitated by the hy- drochloric or acetic acids. Three specimens of human milk examined by myself were found not to be precipitable either by the muriatic, nitric, or sulphuric acids. Although human milk resists the coagulating power of the acids, it is, notwithstanding, easily precipitable by rennet; but the curd so formed is some time in collecting, owing to the minute size of the pre- cipitating flocculi; thus there appears both a physical and chemical difference between the caseous matter from the human subject and that from the cow. The casein of human milk being incapable of forming insoluble combina- tions with the mineral acids, may be regarded as bearing chemically the same relation to the casein of cow's milk that the albuminous matter of the chyle bears to that principle as it exists in the blood. The butyraceous matter of hu- man milk has been stated by some chemists to be too liquid to admit of the formation of butter by churning; this, however, has been proved incorrect by the experiments ofPleischl, who succeeded in obtaining butter from the cream of human milk, which was similar in appearance to that from cow's milk, and expe- riments into the nature of this form of butter have been made by Meggenhofen, who considers it as identical with that obtained from the cow. The specific gravity of human milk has been stated so low as from 1.020 to 1.025, but this is certainly far too low ;.for out of six specimens which I examined the specific gravities varied between 1.030 and 1.035. The proportion of solid matter contained in milk is, according to Meggenhofen, 11 to 12.5 per cent, and some- times more. I have had occasion to verify this result, having obtained 64.15 of solid matter from 500 grains of milk. The specific gravity of this specimen was, however, as high as 1.0358. Human milk when fresh is either neutral or slightly alkaline. Its analysis, according to Meggenhofen, is as follows, being the results obtained from milk from three different sub- jects. No. 1. Alcoholic extractive, but- ter, lactic acid and lac- tates, chloride of sodi- um, traces of sugar of milk 9.13.. 8.81.. 17.12 Aqueous extractive, sugar of milk, and salts 1.14.. 1.29.. 0.88 Caseous matter (coagula- ted by rennet) 2.41. . 1.47. . 2.88 Water 87.25. .88.35. .78.93 The specific gravity of the milk appears to increase as the woman continues suckling, this increase ceasing at some period which is as yet undetermined. Milk at three days after partu- rition I found of specific gravity 1.0310, at four days 1.0334, and at six weeks 1.0358. Payen has analysed three specimens of human milk with the following results:— Butter 5.18.. 5.16. . 5.20 Caseous matter 0.24.. 0.18.. 0.25 Residue of evaporated whey (containing the extractives, salts, and sugar of milk) 7.86.. 7.62.. 7.93 Water 85.80. .86.00. .85.50 Berzelius remarks upon these analysis, and says that a considerable portion of caseous matter remained in all probability in the whey, and was estimated in the residue obtained by evaporation. According to Meggenhofen the salts contained in milk amounted to from 0.5 to 1.25 parts in 500 of the secretion. In an experiment made by myself, 500 grains of milk yielded 1.20 grains of salts. Pfaff and Schwartz obtained 4.407 parts of ash from 1000 of milk, which they found to be composed as follows :— Phosphate of lime 2.500 Phosphate of magnesia 0.500 Phosphate of iron 0.007 Phosphate of soda 0.400 Chloride of potassium 0.700 Soda from decomposed lactate 0.300 4.407 Berzelius very naturally expresses surprise that no carbonate of lime, chloride of sodium, or alkaline sulphate, is mentioned in this ana- lysis, since casein always yields the earthy salt, and chloride of sodium is constantly present in animal matters which are intended for the nou- rishment of man. The absence of alkaline sulphate is quite inexplicable, as it is always a

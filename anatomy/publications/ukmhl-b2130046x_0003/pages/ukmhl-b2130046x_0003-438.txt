The last proportion gives the force exerted by the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to sustain the weight of the man together with the weight r ; now as the sum of the forces exerted by the muscles /' + y + I = 2 X (1936) + 2160 = 6032, and the weight supported being only 120lbs., it follows that the extensor muscles of the leg, to sustain this weight, exert a force = 6032lbs., being more than fifty times the weight. Force of muscles at various stages of their contraction.—The variations which the force of muscles undergoes in different states of their contraction have not yet been thoroughly in- vestigated ; though it is a subject not only susceptible of being pretty accurately deter- mined, but also leads us to form a more cor- rect hypothesis of the laws which regulate the contraction of the muscular fibres, and of the physical operation of the vital agents which are the immediate causes of the contraction. The force of muscles, according to the ex- periments of Schwann, increases with their length, and vice versa. His experiments were made on the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog. The apparatus which he employed consisted of a board, to which the frog was fixed, with the thigh in the horizontal position, the leg being raised so as to be perpendicular to the board, and the foot again flexed to the horizontal position, in which posture the limb was firmly fixed; a rod or beam was suspended over the board and made capable of turning upon it as its axis of oscillation. This balance beam was unequally divided with respect to its axis of motion, one arm being to the other 'as 1 to 6. To the longest arm of the beam a scale was separated; to the other arm the tendo Achillis (which had been carefully exposed and detached from the heel) was attached by means of a thread; by this method a very small contraction of the muscle caused the other end of the beam to revolve through a much greater space, so that the slightest con- traction of the muscle became very apparent. The ischiatic nerve was then laid bare, cut through high up in the thigh, and drawn out, great care being taken not to injure the sur- rounding vessels. The nerve was then laid upon two wires, connected with a galvanic battery, consisting of a single pair of plates, one of the wires being connected with one pole of the battery, and the other made to commu- nicate with the opposite pole by using a slight pressure upon it. The skin was left entire, except where the tendon and nerve were ex- posed. By this simple apparatus, Schwann observed that the force of the muscle was at a maximum when at its greatest elongation, and * This computation differs from that in the 53d prop, of Borelli,. where he has substituted new and arbitrary values for s and z in the two last pro- portions, which diminish the values of y and /. at a minimum at its greatest contraction. In a series of five experiments, whicli were repeated at equal intervals, the forces of the muscles at different lengths were in the following propor- tions : — Force of No. of Muscle Comparative Difference Experi- in grains length of in ments. weight.

In the first two experiments the increase of force and length of muscle were uniform; but in the last three the ratios of the force and the length varied; the earliest ex- periment, however, was performed when the animal might be supposed to be nearest to its normal condition, and therefore when the re- sult approximated most nearly to the healthy play of the muscle. These experiments of Schwann are opposed to the hypotheses of Prevostand Dumas, as well as to those of Meissner, who regard the pheno- mena of muscular contraction to be due to the force of electric attraction, but as the latter in- creases in force the more nearly the attracted bo- dies approach each other, and decreases as they recede in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance, and as the force of elastic bodies varies in a ratio differing from that of muscles, when their length and force affecting them vary, we conclude that the contraction of muscles does not depend upon any of the known laws connected either with electro- dynamics or the forces regulating the molecules of elastic matter. If we conclude from the experiments of Bergolotti, Mayo, and Prevost and Dumas, that the contraction of muscles is unaccom- panied by a diminution of bulk, and that the aggregate molecules present equal volumes and are at equal distances from each other, whe- ther contracted or not, the electric force would remain constant, whilst the muscular force varied; or if with Professors Gruithuisen and

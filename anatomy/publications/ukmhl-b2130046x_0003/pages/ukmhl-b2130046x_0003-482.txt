MOTION. 462 move uniformly in a horizontal line, it has a retrograde motion in its curve of oscillation, which, if measured from its lower extremity, is just equal to the velocity of the point of junc- tion, when estimated in the direction of the tangent of the curve at the commencement of the step. Hence, in quick walking, when the swinging leg is supposed to come to the ground in a vertical position, it describes half of the curve during each step. By following the same course of reasoning Messrs. Weber have ascertained the amount of the vis viva, or vital force, communicated to the swinging leg in any given time ; the amount communicated to the body by the standing leg; the proportion which the time when the body is supported on one leg bears to the whole time of a step ; and the height at which the centre of gravity is borne above the ground.* In order to verify • After an elaborate analysis the Messrs. We- ber have deduced the following equations, which express the general laws of walking. /<* +/»* = /'* (23) (A - ±g a*) * + ;>* = r* (24) L — 1+ n Cos I JL (t — a) \ . .

I' is the length of the liinder leg at the end of the time 8 before it is extended or becomes I. t is the time of one step. t is that portion of it during which the leg is swinging. the pendulous movements of the legs a person was placed upon a small block, and by sup- porting himself on one leg, suffered the other, measuring thirty inches, to swing, with relaxed muscles, as a pendulum. A vibratory motion having been communicated by a slight movement of the trunk backwards and forwards, the num- ber of oscillations made in the time of a minute were found to be 84, consequently 60" — = 0'.714285 = time of one oscillation ; 84 and since the lengths of pendulums at the same place vary inversely as the squares of the numbers of oscillations in a given time, '84* : 60* :: 39£ : I (the length of a pendulum which vibrates synchronously with the leg); ■ , 60* X 394 140850 net hence I = _—_B — = 19.961 842 842 inches. Now as the whole length of the leg was 34 inches, the centre of oscillation must be less than two-thirds of that length from the point of suspension, and consequently less than in a prismatic rod, the length of which is such as will vibrate synchronously with the leg. This accords with the known figure of the leg, the mass of which diminishes as the distance from the axis of motion in- creases. The time of a half oscillation of the freely suspended leg which we have found 0 .714285 _ 0"<3571425j approximates very closely to that found by the Webers, both in the living and the dead subject. The second experiment was made by our engraver, Mr. Vasey. In walking at the rate of four miles per hour he counted 2000 steps 15 X 60 every fifteen minutes; then - = 0".45 2000 the time of each step ; now as 2000 steps were taken in one mile of 5280 feet, the length of each r is the ratio of the distance between m and to' to I. g is the accelerating force of gravity = 32.5 feet. it is the number 3.1416. T is the time of an oscillation of a pendulum whose length is rl. y, is the ratio of the mass of the trunk to the mass of the swinging leg. The quantities I' T, fj. must be previously ascertained, and it and g being always the same, there will be nine equations for finding the values of the ten remaining quantities ; if therefore we know any one of these ten, the rest may be found. In regular progression the force communicated by the supporting leg to the trunk must equal that imparted by the trunk to the swinging leg, that is m'(c+rnpJ!L sin| JL (f—a) j V—m'(i— r) 2ca to + m ,2 ( - t , = —r—s v ' from which, by substituting ?i_ for c and /a. for — we get equation (26.) m

MOTION. 460 would require a great expenditure of muscular force, which is avoided by the inclination of the trunk. That this inclination really takes place is confirmed by experience, and its amount has been measured by Weber, both in walking and running with various degrees of velocity. In order to take these measures with accuracy, a given path was passed over, some- times in running and sometimes in walking, with various degrees of speed, the time being measured and the steps counted. By means of a telescope, placed sideways to this path, the difference of inclination in walking and running was ascertained, but as it was extremely difficult to find the actual position of the centre of gravity of the trunk in such varying posi- tions, a conspicuous line marked on the trunk was substituted for the vertical line passing from the axis of the femurs through the centre of gravity, and thus its slightest deviations were observed. The vertical position of the trunk when at rest maybe exactly estimated by the angle which it makes with this marked line in walking to and fro, in running to and fro, and in standing in the two opposite positions. The last angle, deducted from each of the two first, gives the double inclination of the trunk from the vertical in walking and running. The results of these measurements are given in the following Tables. Table 1. Measure of the inclination of the trunk in walking and running.

The trunk, then, as has been before observed, exactly re- sembles a rod balanced on the finger and carried forward; the inclination in both cases depending on the laws of mechanics. The force of the muscles which keep the trunk in a state of equilibrium is likewise eco- nomized in walking and running by the regular oscillations of the arms. The distance of the scapulo-humeral articulation from the axis on which the trunk freely moves, gives any force applied at the shoulder-joint a considerable mechanical effect on the trunk. In progression the arms and legs move simultaneously in the following order. Whilst the right leg swings forwards, the trunk is turned round hori- zontally on the head of the left femur, and would propel the right shoulder before the left, but at the same time the right arm swings back- ward and the left forwards, and by generating a force in an opposite direction neutralises this tendency. A corresponding compensation takes place when the left leg swings forward, and this is effected by a good walker, without any sensible lateral twisting of the trunk. The length of the arms is so adjusted to that of the legs, that they oscillate with the latter in small curves simultaneously. Weber has computed the duration of a single oscillation of the arm, hanging straight down, at 0".63, and when bent at right angles at 0".53. The pace is less con- strained and less fatiguing when the arms are

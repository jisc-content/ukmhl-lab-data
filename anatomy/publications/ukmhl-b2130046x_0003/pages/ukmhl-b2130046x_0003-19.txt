THE CYCLOPAEDIA ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. INSTINCT.—This word is often applied to the mental acts of the lower animals, as if it were truly applicable to the whole of these acts; but a little consideration will shew, first, that this word, in its more approved and correct acceptation, is applicable only to a part of the mental operations, which may be inferred from the observation of the actions and habits of animals; and secondly, that in this restricted sense, the term is applicable to a part of the operations of the human mind itself; and that the subject of instinct cannot be tho- roughly understood, unless information regard- ing it is sought in the consciousness of our own minds, as well as in the observation of other living beings. The study of this subject is therefore equally important as a part of natural history, of mental philosophy, and of human physiology ; and is a good dlustration of the necessity of this latter science being based on the observation and generalization of the laws and conditions of vital action through- out the whole extent of the animal creation. It is obvious, indeed, that various mental acts, of which we are conscious in ourselves, may be inferred, with perfect confidence, to take place throughout the whole range of the animal kingdom, and even that some of them must be performed with greater energy and precision in some of the lower tribes than in man. The different external senses attain their highest perfection in different animals ; that of smell, for example, probably in the predaceous mammalia, that of touch in the antenna of insects, and that of sight in the predaceous birds ; it is not likely that any one is enjoyed in its highest perfection by man; and what ■'have been accurately distinguished from mere VOL. III. sensations as the perceptions of external things, i. e. the notions as to the qualities of these, which naturally present themselves to our minds in consequence of sensations being felt, would seem in various instances to follow the sensa- tions more quickly and more surely in other animals than in us ; for it is generally allowed that what appear to be acquired perceptions of the eye to us, i. e. the notions of the distance, size, and form of visible objects, are instanta- neously made known to many of the lower animals the very first time that those objects make impressions on their retinae; the faculty of Intuition, which we must admit as part of the source of our own knowledge, appears to exist in greater perfection in other animals, and the notions of external things which they thus acquire are amply sufficient to regulate their muscular motions. It is equally plain that many of the strictly mental acts, of which our complex trains of thought are composed, are habitually performed by animals ; that they have a perfect recollec- tion of past sensations, implying the exercise of the powers of memory and of conception ; that the emotions of fear, of joy, of affection, of anger, even of jealousy, are as distinctly indi- cated by their actions as by those of man ; that under the influence of these emotions their mental operations are excited or depressed, and their attention fixed or distracted, and their volition excited, as in our own case; and that their actions are habitually guided by a clear perception, or rather, we should say, by conti- nual correct applications, of a first principle of belief, which is generally admitted to be an ultimate fact in the constitution of the human mind, and on which much stress has been

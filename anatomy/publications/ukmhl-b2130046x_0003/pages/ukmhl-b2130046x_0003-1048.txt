PHARYNX. 946 membrane is of great width at its origin, the external carotid foramina marking off the la- teral limits, but it quickly narrows as it de- scends : the sharp angle which it forms is brought into relation with the internal carotid artery and superior cervical ganglia of the sym- pathetic nerve: in the interior of the pharynx a longitudinal sulcus, sometimes crossed by a transverse slip, will be found behind the open- ing of the Eustachan tube, leading to a cul-de- sac which occupies this angle. The pharynx is surrounded by muscular fibres which have been collected into three distinct muscles on either side, and named, from their action, constrictors; these may be considered as intrinsic: two other muscles on either side are inserted into its walls, and are extrinsic as not belonging so exclusively to it. The constrictor muscles are membraniform, spreading as thin muscular laminae around the sides and back part of the pharynx, and have a common insertion into a posterior median raphe: they partly overlap each other from below upwards, so that the inferior constrictors alone can be wholly examined without inter- fering with the rest, and are invested on their outer surface with a dense fascia: they arise by numerous and distinct points of attachment, which gave occasion to their being divided originally into several muscles, each with its appropriate name given according to its par- ticular origin : these are now reduced to three on each side, and arranged into superior, middle, and inferior. Constrictor pharyngis inferior.* â€” This muscle is the thickest and strongest of the set, has an irregular quadrilateral outline, and is situated at the lower part of the pharynx: it derives its origin from the cricoid and thyroid cartilages by two slips: the one, triangular and fleshy, arises from the side of the cricoid car- tilage between the origins of the crico-arytenoi- deus posticus and crico-thyroideus muscles: from the latter it occasionally receives a few fibres : the other, broader and more extensive, lies on the ala of the thyroid cartilage, and arises from the two tubercles, which the ala presents on its external surface, and from a tendinous structure that stretches obliquely from one tubercle to the other: it is here blended with the attachments of the sterno- thyroid and thyro-hyoid muscles : it also em- braces the inferior cornu of the thyroid carti- lage : from these points it spreads round the side and back of the pharynx to the posterior median raphe, into which it is inserted con- jointly with the muscle from the opposite side: the fibres pass in different directions: the su- perior are longer and pursue a more oblique course upwards, while the nearer they are ex- amined to the lower margin of the muscle, the shorter and less oblique they become, and at length assume nearly a transverse direction. The origins of the inferior constrictor muscle are concealed by the thyroid gland and sterno- thyroid muscle : it is in relation laterally to the * Thyro-pharyngcus, crico-pharyngeus. sheath of the carotid vessels, and posteriorly to the cervical vertebra; and deep muscles of the neck: its internal surface is applied partly upon the mucous membrane and the terminal fibres of the stylo-pharyngeus and palato-pha- ryngeus muscles, but to a greater extent upon the middle constrictor muscle: the oblique upper margin extends as high as the middle of the pharynx and close by its thyroid attach- ment allows the superior laryngeal nerve to pass beneath it: the circular fibres of the oeso- phagus are continued from its lower margin, but distinguished by their greater delicacy and paler colour: close to the cricoid cartilage the inferior or recurrent laryngeal nerve slips be- neath its lower margin. Some of the lower fibres have occasionally been noticed to arise from the first ring of the trachea. Constrictor pharyngis rnedius* is of a trian- gular form, fixed by its apex to the hyoid bone and by an extensive base to the median raphe behind : its origin is received into the angle formed by the greater and smaller cornua of the os hyoides, to which processes the muscular fibres are attached as well as to the lower part of the stylo-hyoid ligament: the origin extends along the greater cornu quite to its posterior extremity, and is concealed by the hyo-glossus muscle, the lingual artery intervening: from this contracted commencement the middle con- strictor spreads widely over the back of the pharynx, the superior fibres obliquely ascend- ing towards the basilar process of the occipital bone, to the spine of which they are connected through the medium of the raphe, the muscle itself rarely reaching so high; the middle fibres take a more or less transverse direction, while the inferior descend under cover of the inferior constrictor: the whole muscle is inserted, with its fellow from the opposite side, into the raphe. After emerging from beneath the hyo- glossus it is related to the external carotid ar- tery and superior laryngeal nerve laterally, and to the vertebral column behind : by its internal surface it overlaps the superior constrictor, and is applied upon the stylo- and palato-pharyngei muscles and the mucous membrane. Near the great cornu of the hyoid bone the stylo-pha- ryngeus muscle insinuates itself beneath its upper border, separating it from the superior constrictor. Constrictor pharyngis superior,^ quadrila- teral in shape and complicated from its very numerous attachments. The fibres of this muscle are paler and it is altogether thinner than the two former: it arises, firstly, by short tendi- nous fibres from the lower half of the posterior edge of the internal pterygoid plate and its ha- mular process; secondly, from an aponeurosis described as the inter- or pterygo-maxillary liga- ment common to it and the buccinator muscle, and which stretches from the inner pterygoid plate to the posterior extremity of the alveolar border of the inferior maxillary bone; thirdly, from the back part of the mylo-hyoid ridge; * Hyo-pharyngeus. t Cephalo - pharyngeus, pterygo - pharyngeus, mylo-pharyngeus, glosso-pharyngcns.

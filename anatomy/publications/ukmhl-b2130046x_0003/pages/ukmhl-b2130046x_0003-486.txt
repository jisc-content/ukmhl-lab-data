When the centre of gravity is most depressed, the swinging leg must be placed on the ground in the vertical position, instead of being suffered to pass be- yond it, as it does in slow walking. In quick walking the propelling leg acts more obliquely on the trunk, which is more inclined, and forced forwards more rapidly than in slow walking. The time when both legs are on the ground diminishes as the velocity increases, and it vanishes altogether when the velocity is at a maximum. Table 5. Measure of the velocity in quickest walking.

In conducting their experiments the MM. Weber found that the velocity was constant, whether the power of the muscular system had been renovated by repose, or exhausted by fatigue, and therefore they concluded " that so long as the muscles exert the general force necessary to execute locomotion, the velocity depends on the size of the legs and on external forces, but not on the strength of the muscles."

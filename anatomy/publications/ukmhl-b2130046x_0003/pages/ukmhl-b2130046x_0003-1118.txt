ANALYTICAL INDEX. 1016 Life (continued), , Dr. Prout's definition, 146 HI. Nature and causes of vital action, 146 all changes the results of the properties of matter called into exercise by appropriate stimuli, 140 functions groups of vital phenomena, 146 dependence of vital actions upon external sti- muli, 147 every class of organs is excited to action by its particular stimuli, 147 conditions of a more general nature requisite for the performance of vital actions, as heat, light, and electricity, 147 analogy of vital phenomena to those of the universe at large, 147 illustration—the earth, solar system, and uni- verse, 147 illustration—the steam-engine, 148 conclusion—vital actions the properties of organs called into action by appropriate stimuli, 148 IV. The connection between vitality and organiza- tion, 148 probability that the properties which give rise to vital action exist in all forms of matter or at least in all of those forms of it capable of be- coming organized, 148 total change effected in the properties of certain forms of matter by their entrance into new combinations due to the act of combination, > as analogous to vital properties being due to the act of organization, 149 no property distinct from the matter which ex- hibits it, or capable of being superadded to it or abstracted from it, analogy of the magnetic properties of iron to vitality considered, 149 evidence of vitality being due to the properties of matter in the condition of organized tissues, to be found in the vital actions themselves, 149 the assertion that the existence of organization implies a previous existence of life, considered, 150 many actions performed by living beings common to them and inorganic matter, 150 preparation of materials for organization, 150 V. Changes in composition, 151 formation of proximate principles, 151 grounds for the assumption of a distinct set of vital affinities, 151 reasons for believing that the compounds with which organic chemistry supplies us have a si- milar constitution to that of inorganic com- pounds, 152 the arguments in favour of viral affinity drawn from the spontaneous decomposition of organic matter, considered, 152 organic matter, considered, 152 presumed impossibility of artificially pro- ducing organic compounds or proximate principles, considered, 153 artificial and natural conversion of gum, starch, and lignin into sugar, 153 catalytic action, 153 evolution of electricity during the ordinary processes of growth of plants and animals, 154 inability of chemists to produce organic com- pounds probably due to their want of ac- quaintance with the form or condition in which their components must be brought together in order to enter into the desired union, 154 conclusions deduced from the foregoing para- graphs of the chapter, 154 VI.

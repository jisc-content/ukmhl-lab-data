Analysis of milk. Occasionally we may have to perform an analysis of milk : we may proceed as in the following instance. The milk was rather thin, watery in appear- ance, and hadasp.gr. of 1031. It was ob- tained from a woman aged 25, three weeks after the birth of her fourth child. (a) 100 grs. evaporated to dryness left 11.49 grs. of solid matter. 100 : 1000 : 11.49 : x (= 114.9) solids per 1000. 1000 —114.9 = 885.1 ivuterper 1000. (b) On incinerating the residue, an alkaline ash was left amounting to 0.24 grs. = salts 2.4 per 1000. (c) 158 grs. of the milk were mixed with a few drops of acetic acid and evaporated to dry- ness, and digested repeatedly in ether (the ether was first allowed to macerate upon the residue unpowdered. It was decanted and the greater part of the fat thus removed; the residue was completely dried, powdered, and again subjected to three or four digestions with ether. All the ethereal solutions were then evaporated.) The fatty matter amounted to 4.61 grs. 158 : 1000 : : 4.61 : at (= 29.13) butter per 1000. (d) The portion insoluble in ether was di- gested in dilute alcohol (sp. gv. 920) as long- as any thing dissolved. The solution on eva- poration yielded a yellowish granular mass, consisting of milk sugar, and a little extractive matter: it amounted to 9.7 grs. and appeared perfectly free from casein. 158 : 1000 : : 9.7 : x (= 61.39) sugar of milk per 1000. (e) The insoluble residue consisted almost entirely of casein, with a small quantity of sa- line matter. Calculating by the deficiency, (as, owing to an accident, it was not weighed,) it amounted to 3.85 grs. 158 : 1000 : : 3.85 : x (= 24.37) casein per 1000. The results of the analysis may be summed up as follows :— Water 885.1 ' Fatty matter .... Sugar and alco- } holic extract.. S Casein and wa- } tery extract . . S Organic matter, 112.5. Saline residue, 2.4. 29.13 61.39 24.38 1000.00 The proportion of " extractive matter " in milk varies, but I am not aware of any ready method of determining its quantity, apart from that of the sugar and casein. If we attempt to digest casein in water, it swells up and partly dissolves, becomes gelatinous, and does not allow the fluid to pass through the pores of the filter. If a cold saturated solution of sugar of milk in proof spirit, (sp. gr. 920,) be allowed to digest for a few days in a closed flask upon the spirituous extract (d), the liquid assumes a yellow colour from dissolved extract, and the sugar is left in white crystalline grains, but this can hardly be used as a process for analysis. 4. Analysis of bile. Our methods for analysing this complicated and important secretion are very inadequate. Still, such as they are, I have endeavoured to illustrate thein by the following example:—■ The bile analysed was obtained from a man set. 75, who died of gangrena senilis. The gall-bladder was removed entire, and the bile examined 48 hours after death. It was a brownish, turbid, scarcely ropy fluid, of sp. gr. 1024, and amounted to about 240 grs. (a) 65.16 grs. evaporated to dryness left 4.83 grs. This residue on incineration left 0.75 grs. of saline matter. 65,16 : 1000 : : 0.75 : x (= 11.51) salts per 1000. 4.83 — 0.75 = 4.08 and 65.16 :1000 : : 4.08 : x (= 62.61) organic matter per 1000. Therefore 1000 — (11.51 +62.61)= 925.88 water per 1000. (b) 171.2 grs. mingled with thrice its bulk of alcohol, and filtered, left a yellowish ropy residue of mucus, which, when well washed with alcohol and dried, amounted to 5.1 grs. 171.2 : 1000 : : 5.1 : x (== 29.78) mucus per 1000.* (c) The filtered liquid was evaporated nearly to dryness and mingled with ether. A bright yellow solution was obtained ; it was decanted, and the residue repeatedly digested with ether. The mixed ethereal solutions, on evaporation, left 2.8 grs., of which 0.6 grs. was soluble in water (being biliary matter). 2.8 — 0.6 = 2.2 ethereal extract. (d) The ethereal extract was treated with a weak solution of ammonia; a brown liquid was obtained, and a white crystalline residue of cholesterin was left, amounting to 0.31 grs. 171.2 : 1000 : : 0.31 : x (= 1.81) choles- terin per 1000 2.2 — 0.31 = 1.89. 171.2 : 1000 : : 1.89 : x (== 11.04) uncom- bined fatty and resinous acids per 1000. (e) The residue insoluble in ether was treated repeatedly with hot alcohol. It left undis- solved a remainder, which when dry amounted to 2.92 grs. 171.2 : 1000 : : 2.92 : x (= 17.05) watery extract. * The proportion of matter insoluble in alcohol in this instance was very great, probably it con- tained something besides ordinary mucus; but circumstances prevented my examining it more minutely.

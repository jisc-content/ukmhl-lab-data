PHARYNX. 948 they become flaccid, and are loosely applied to the posterior surface of the larynx, and so con- tinued into the oesophagus: if examined from behind, the pharynx is seen to be of great breadth at the base of the skull, but narrows until opposed to the buccal cavity, where it again widens to contract somewhat abruptly at its termination : its lateral relations to the ca- rotid vessels and nerves of the ueck have been considered in the descriptions of the constrictor muscles. 3. The cavity and its openings.—The interior of the pharynx exhibits a cavity of considerable size, which is continuous with those of the nasal fossae and mouth anteriorly and the canal of the oesophagus below. To study the varying dimensions of this cavity and the different openings which communicate with it, the pha- rynx must be slit up posteriorly and in the median line ; its greatest breadth is behind the mouth, the buccal portion, which may be mea- sured by the interval between the posterior ex- tremities of the alveolar border of the lower jaw, and is rather more than two inches ; thence narrowing upwards, the internal pterygoid plates will by their distance from each other, which is about one inch, give the diameter of the cavity at its nasal portion, while the distance between the posterior edges of the alee of the thyroid cartilage will denote its breadth at the inferior or laryngeal portion : the anteroposte- rior diameter can vary but little, in consequence of the relation which the vertebral column has to the pharynx behind : during the act of deglu- tition these measurements are of course altered, but there is much less change of form in the upper or nasal portion of the cavity than in the rest of its extent. Dropping into the cavity from before backwards and from above down- wards is the velum palati with the uvula de- pending from the centre of its posterior border : above this moveable curtain are seen the poste- rior openings of the nose with its median sep- tum, the vomer: these are situated between the internal pterygoid plates, extend upwards to the base of the skull, and are limited below by the velum ; they are quadrilateral in their outline and continued into the upper part of the pharyngeal cavity; a little way within the nasal fossae and along their outer walls are seen the meatuses of the nose and the posterior edges of the inferior turbinated bones; pro- longing these latter backwards by an imaginary line, we are brought to the openings of the Eustachian tubes; they are two narrow ellipti- cal fissures, their long diameters, about three- eighths of an inch, directed from above down- wards, and situated one on either side of the pharynx above the soft palate, and impinging the posterior edges of the internal pterygoid plates ; they look forwards and inwards towards the inferior and middle meatuses of the nose, and are marked by prominent and rounded margins internally; an accurate knowledge of their relation to the nasal fossa; is of practical use in directing a probe or syringe into their canals ; behind the openings of the Eustachian tubes are the longitudinal sulci which lead up- wards and backwards to a cul-de-sac that occu- pies the angle formed by the sudden bending forward of the aponeurosis of the pharynx ; below the velum is the posterior constricted aperture of the mouth, which will be again referred to in the description of the soft palate; it is limited above by the velum, below by the base of the tongue, and laterally by the poste- rior pillars of the fauces ; the uvula depending from the velum centrally gives it a double arched outline above, but it is capable of as- suming changes of form by the varied move- ments of its boundaries, which are especially concerned in deglutition ; below the isthmus faucium and behind the base of the tongue is the superior aperture of the larynx, surmounted in front by the epiglottis ; it is a triangular opening, the base directed forwards, and it has also an oblique dnection from above down- wards and from before backwards ; it is gene- rally completely closed during deglutition by the epiglottis being forced down upon it; on either side of the posterior surface of the larynx, between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, are two gutters which lead downwards to the oesophageal opening of the pharynx; this open- ing has its long diameter from side to side in the flaccid state of its walls, but assumes a circular form when distended by the passage of food through it. 4. Mucous membrane and glands.—The inte- rior of the pharynx is lined by a mucous mem- brane continuous with that investing the several cavities which open into it; it is of a reddish colour, and adherent to the muscular parietes by a thin submucous areolar tissue; from co- vering the back part and sides of the interior of the pharynx, it is to be traced along the under surface of the basilar process united to the periosteum through the medium of its sub- mucous tunic, which at this part acquires con- siderable thickness, and is occasionally the seat of polypus; laterally and above it is reflected over the guttural orifice of the Eustachian tube, enters the canal, and is conducted by it to the cavity of the tympanum, forming an exceed- ingly thin lining to both; continuous with the mucous membrane, investing the upper surface of the velum, it passes through the posterior nasal openings into the nose; it may be next traced through the isthmus faucium, covering the under surface of the velum and posterior pillars of the fauces, to be continuous with the membrane of the buccal cavity, while more in- teriorly, after assisting to form the aryteno- epiglottidean folds of the laryngeal mucous membrane, it is reflected over the posterior surface of the larynx, to which it is connected so loosely by an areolar tissue as to be thrown into longitudinal folds, a provision for the dila- tation of this part of the pharynx during the pas- sage of the food ; lastly, it is continued into the oesophagus. The mucous membrane above the velum palati, upon its upper surface and within the Eustachian tubes, is coated with epithelial prisms, corresponding in this respect with that which lines the greater part of the nasal cavities, while below the velum the epithelium assumes the lamelliform or scaly character.

472 MOTION. running are fulfilled if the vital force which the body receives by the extension of the supported leg whilst it is on the ground, is equal to the vital force communicated to the swinging leg during the time of its oscil- lation.* The motions of walking and running tend continually to approximate, in proportion as the time in which both legs are on the ground in the former, and the time in which the body is not supported at all in the latter, is diminished, and the laws of botli running and walking coincide, when the time that the body swings unsup- ported in the air in the former, and that where both legs are on the ground in the latter, vanishes. The resistance of the air to the trunk, when it is propelled with great velocity as in run- ning, requires to be compensated, in order to be kept in a state of equilibrium, either by the force of its own gravity, or by that of its muscular system. The former method is usually adopted to prevent an unnecessary expenditure of vital power. It will be seen in Table 4, that the angle of inclination of the trunk in running, is to that in quick walking, as 49°.8 to 31°.8, when the h ' — ~ (33) {l + rnt^)2~ (1 — rf ~ l^B 8(35) In whicli equations, a — T r 1 P arc (cos — \ w n ' Igt* The other expressions being the same as those in walking, c .... is the uniform velocity of the point m in a horizontal direction. s .... is the space through which the centre of ^ gravity is raised in the time *. s' is the space through which the same centre is raised in the time t — 8. WhenT—< — o, that is, in slowest running, the above equations become identical with those in quickest walking, where the time during which botli legs are on the ground vanishes. * That is, when (m + w')^^-^ (l-^\ - m (I + r n 11)2 c3 — m' (1 — rf ca and as /* — —, by substituting /*, we get equa- tion (33), from which the height of the centre of gravity is to be found. length of step in the former is to that in the latter as 1.509 to 0.888. In order to find the amount of the vertical undulations of the trunk in running, MM. Weber viewed the runner through a telescope, adapted for that purpose. They calculate the undulations to be from fth to Jth of an inch ; they estimate the duration of the step to be ]th to ith of a second, of which the body swings freely in the air T'5th of a second, and of this falls T'5th ; now, by the law of falling bod ies, the centre of gravity will descend in this time 22 mm. = 0-85614 in.; hence, the body falls through a less space in running than in walking.

The right foot is marked a, the left b, and the centre of gravity c : A, 2 signifies that during the time « is passing from a to a.2, and c from c to c2, b remains standing on the point 6, 2, and so on. In order to distinguish the swing- ing from the supporting leg, in Jig. 262, the former is so contracted that it does not reach the horizontal line ; and in Jig. 263, the swing- ing leg is represented as if it swerved from the path both on the right and left sides alter- nately : r 1( c, = c3, c5 = c5, r7, indicate the length of the step — p, uv u.i 4 = a3 v a7 9 = bl 2, b. 6 = 2 p. The time which elapses from the instant when b steps in 6, 2 to «, in «34, is the duration of a step t. The time in which c advances from c, to c2 is the time t, when the body is supported upon one leg. The time in which c advances from c2 to c3 is the time t — f, during which the body swings in the air. The time in which c advances from c2 to cs, is the time in which the left leg swings, whicli is greater than t, in which c merely passes from c3 to cy The instant when the left leg steps in 6, or the right in a3, the leg must press against the ground with such force as to impede the accelerating force of gravity upon the body, and communicate to it an ascending movement; to accomplish this, the leg must be set down on the ground per- pendicularly, therefore the lines c„ bl,c3,a3, &c. are vertical.

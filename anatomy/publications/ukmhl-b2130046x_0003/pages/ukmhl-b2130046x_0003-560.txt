540 MUSCULAR SYSTEM. becoming prejudicial to the other members of the animal creation. The tyrant must neces- sarily be stronger and more sagacious than the victims intended to be subdued, and accord- ingly, in the Arachnida, the great law that has hitherto been our guide in tracing the develop- ment of the muscular system is carried out one step further. The coalescence of the nervous ganglia and consequent concentration of the skeleton is found in these creatures to be more conspicuous than even among the Insects the n- selves: even the head and thorax, which in the last class were distinct from each other, now become fused into one piece, forming the cephalo-thorax of the creatures under considera- tion. The limbs and the jaws are thus rendered stronger and more formidable, and the muscles whereby they are wielded attain the fullest development permitted amongst articulated animals. Among the Crustacea forming the last class of this important sub-kingdom of creation, we find a series of aquatic Articulata running parallel as relates to the condition of their muscular system with the terrestrial Arti- culata, and exhibiting precisely the same rela- tions between the state of concentration of the nervous system, and the degree of efficiency conferred upon their locomotive apparatus. The humblest forms of Crustaceans have all the segments of the body distinct and move- able, and, moreover, in their elongated shape resemble the larvae of aquatic Insects. In these the articulated limbs appended to the different segments of the body are extremely feeble, and only adapted to natation ; but pro- ceeding upwards in the scale the locomotive members assume a more effective appearance, and the segments supporting them run together, and become consolidated. Whilst the muscles of the trunk preponderate in their development, as in the Shrimps and Macrourous Decapods, the limbs are of secondary importance as instruments of locomotion, and the largely developed tail forms a strong and powerful oar, a means of propulsion best fitted to their nata- torial habits; but as we approach the shore and meet with Crustaceans, adapted to a littoral existence, the muscles of the trunk become diminished in importance in proportion as the legs acquire additional strength. The concen- tration of the segments of the trunk is carried out to the greatest possible extent in the Bra- chyurous Decapods, and the Crabs are thus enabled to leave the sea and prowl about upon the beach, or even to exchange an aquatic for a terrestrial existence; and, as in the case of the Land Crabs, to reside during a greater part of the year at a distance from their native element. It is, however, interesting to observe that in the most highly organized of the Crustaceans, the Brachyura, the complete centralization of the body and nervous ganglia is effected, as in the case of Insects, in a slow and gradual manner, and that their muscular system under- goes a metamorphosis scarcely less remarkable than that observed among the Insects them- selves. The Crab on first leaving the egg is almost in the condition of a long-tailed Shrimp, and the locomotive limbs scarcely to be recog- nised as being worthy of such a title, being not only rudimentary in their size but exclusively adapted for swimming; and it is only after several times casting its shell and passing through distinct gradations of form, that the muscles of the legs attain the preponderancy over those of the trunk and become strong enough for progression on land. The fourth grand division of the animal kingdom, comprising the MOLLUSCA of Cuvier, is characterized by the dispersed con- dition of the nervous ganglia, which, through- out the extensive series of creatures constructed according to this type, are distributed without any symmetrical arrangement in different parts of the body, whence the Mollusca have been named by Professor Grant Cyclo-gangliata, and more recently by Professor Owen Hltero- gangliata, the latter term being, as we con- ceive, the preferable of the two. In the Mol- lusca the general outline of the body partici- pates, more or less, in the want of symmetry that is so conspicuous in the disposition of the ganglia composing the nervous system, and the muscular apparatus does not exhibit that pre- cision and regularity which is visible among all the Articulata. There is no longer, in fact, any frame-work, but when a shell is present, as, forexainple, in the Snails and kindred forms, both terrestrial and marine, it is only in those parts of the body that are protrusible from the testaceous covering that the tegument exhibits this decided muscularity, the mantle lining the shell being constantly thin and membranous. But the most strongly developed part of the muscular covering of a gasteropod is the broad fleshy disc attached to the ventral surface of the body which constitutes the apparatus of locomotion, and gives the name conferred by zoologists upon the entire class. This disc, or foot, as it is likewise called, is entirely made up of contractile fibres, disposed in various directions, so as to confer all the capabilities of movement necessary for securing progres- sion along the plane surfaces over which these sluggish animals are destined to crawl. Having, as yet, no internal skeleton deve- loped, and being equally destitute of any thing like an external articulated frame-work, it must be evident that if creatures of this description are to be provided with organs requiring to be moved by subordinate sets of muscles, seeing that there is no fiim point of attachment to be found, as is the case among Insects or the Vertebrata, recourse must be had to a new plan, and accordingly few more remarkable deviations from what is generally met with in other animals can be pointed out than we meet with in the extensive class under consideration. The parts of the mouth, the tentacles, the eyes, and those parts of the male generative system needed for copulation, are in many instances so constructed that they may, when not in use, be completely retracted into the general cavity of the body and packed up amongst the viscera by means of a mechanism quite peculiar, and of which a particular account is elsewhere given.

NECK. Fig. 328. 5G9 Shews from below the eervico-thoracic septum constituting the roof of the thorax, and giving -passage to the great vessels. It represents a tranmerse and horizontal section through the second intervertebral disc, and parts at the same level. A, second dorsal vertebra. B, tranverse division of the manubrium sterni C, first ribs. D, vertebral extremity of second ribs. a, a, fascia, extending between the great vessels and first two ribs. b, b, its insertion at the first ribs. c, c, its inseriion at the second vertebrae. d, d, lamina between the great vessels, attached centrally to them,— in front to the sternum, where it forms a cul-de-sac,— and behind to the second dorsal vertebra. cordance with the general law of its arrange- ment for the separation of muscles; is desti- tute of any particular surgical interest, and forms no exception to the general observations given in a preceding article. (See Back.) A portion (but a very distinct portion) of this great aponeurosis is the pre-vertebral fascia, it extends from the occiput—to which it is e, the aponeurosis, extending within the sternum, /', the trachea. g, the oesophagus. h, the arteiia innominata. i, the right vena innominata. k, the left vena innominata; tranverse band uni- ting the two sides of the aponeurosis. I, the left carotid artery. m, the left subclavian artery. n, section of the muse. long, colli. fixed in front of the recti capitis antici—to the inlet of the chest, where it adheres, beside the longus colli, to the neck of the first rib; it binds down the pre-vertebral muscles, is at- tached deeply to the tips of the transverse pro- cesses, and receives by its surface a septal slip from the cervical fascia just externally to the sheath of the vessels.

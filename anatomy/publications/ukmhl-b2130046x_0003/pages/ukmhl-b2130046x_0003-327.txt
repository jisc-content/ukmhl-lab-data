Brandies of ike ahdom receives also the coronary vein of the heart: the termination of this and the two other venous trunks in the right auricle has already been noticed. Respiratory organs.—In the condition and structure of the respiratory organs all the Mar- supial species adhere to the Mammalian type ; the only tendency to the Ovipara is in the entireness of the tracheal rings in certain spe- cies. In the Phalangista J'uliginosa, where I counted twenty-nine rings, the first four-and- twenty were entire; below these they were divided posteriorly, the interspace growing ■wider to the twenty-ninth ring. In the Dasi/- iims mucrurm the rings of the trachea are twenty-three in number, and are incomplete or rather ununited behind. In the Perameles the tracheal rings are divided posteriorly by a fis- sure. In no species have I found the trachea divided near the larynx into two long bronehise, irutl aorta, Kangaroo. as in the Rodent genus Heliimys, nor convo- luted in the chest as in the Edentate Sloth, both of which modifications are more striking ap- proximations to the oviparous type of structure than the entire rings above-mentioned. The lungs present the most simple form in the Wombat, in which they consist of a single lobe on both the right and left sides, with a small lobulus azygos extending from the right lung to the interspace between the heart and diaphragm. In the Mucropus major I found the right lung with two notches on the anterior margin, and the left lung undivided. In the Macropus Parryi both lungs had one or two notches. In another Kangaroo I found the right lung divided into four lobes, the left into two. The azygos lobe is large in consequence of the length of the chest in the Kangaroos, and the distance of the heart from the diaphragm : it is

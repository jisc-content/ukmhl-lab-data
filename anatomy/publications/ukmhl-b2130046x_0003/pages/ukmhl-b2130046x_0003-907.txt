ORGANIC ANALYSIS. matters. The analysis must afterwards be pro- ceeded with upon the principles already laid down, being first directed to the soluble ingre- dients and then to the insoluble matters. C. Proximate analysis of individual SECRETIONS. 1. Of the urine- The following is a detailed example of the method of analysing healthy urine:— As there was abundance of the fluid for exa- mination, fresh portions were taken whenever it seemed desirable to do so for determining any particular ingredient. The secretion had a sp. gr. of 1020.4. It distinctly reddened litmus paper, and exhi- bited a slight cloud of floating mucus. (a) 3200 grs. were filtered through a weighed filter, and the mucus collected. It amounted to 0.53 grs. 3200 :1000 : : 0.53 : x (= 0.165) mucus. (b) 200 grs. evaporated in a counterpoised capsule left 8.64 grs. 200 : 1000 : : 8.64 : x (= 43.2) solid mut- ters. 1000 — 43.2 = 956.8 water. (c) The residue, 8.64 after evaporation, ig- nited in the capsule left 2.36 grs. of saline matter. 200 : 1000 : : 2.36 : x {— 11.8) fixed suits. (d) 1000 grs. of urine (freed from mucus by filtration) was evaporated to dryness in a pla- tinum capsule. It was treated with water, acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and left 0.37 grs. of uric acid; after incineration of the uric acid a trace of silica remained. (e) During the last three years I have made many careful analyses of the urine with express attempts to obtain from it the lactic acid it is said to contain; but though I employed various methods, and in some instances large quantities of urine, I have never succeeded in eliminating it from fresh urine, and I therefore (as the methods used were capable of detecting- small quantities of the lactates when purposely mingled with the urine) concluded that lactic acid is not a normal constituent of human urine. Liebig has lately stated the same fact founded on his own recent examinations of the secretion. (f) 1000 grs. of urine were evaporated to dryness and exhausted with alcohol. This alcoholic solution was evaporated, the dry mass treated with water, and nitric acid added, with the precautions already mentioned, fur- nished 29.17 grs. of nitrate of urea. 100 : 29.17": : 48.78 : x (= 14.23) urea. (g) The residue after exhaustion with alco- hol weighed 6.6 grs. It was ignited, and left a saline mass, amounting to 4.46 grs. 6.6—4.46 = 2.14 organic matter. From this we deduct the uric acid 0.37 (d), and mucus0.16.5 («),the residue 1.605, is" watery extract." (h) The portion soluble in alcohol amounts to 43.2—6.6, or 36.6 grs., which we find com- posed as follows: The total saline matter of the urine (in- cluding the sulphuric acid volatilized by igni- tion (r)) amounts to. .13.388 grs. (= 11.8 + 1.588) deduct .... 4.46 salts insoluble in alcohol (g) remain .... 8.928 salts dissolved by ■ alcohol. fixed salts 8.928 urea 14.230 by (/) mur. ammonia 0.915 by (u) 24.073 36.6 — 24.073= 12.527 alcoholic extract. The composition of the urinary salts has now to be determined. (<) 1000 grs. of urine were acidulated with nitric acid, and mixed with a solution of ni- trate of silver, an abundant precipitate of chloride of silver ensued. The filter with the precipitate weighed 39.13 The filter alone 15.23 Total wt.of the chloride before fusion 23.90 23.12 of chloride fused in a counterpoised porcelain capsule gave 19.12 grs., weight of chloride after fusion. 23.12 : 23.90 : : 19.12 : x (— 19.77) fused chloride silver. 100 : 19.77 : : 25 : x (= 4.942) chlorine. (k) The filtered liquid was treated with nitrate of baryta, the precipitate collected, well washed with boiling water, ignited, weighed 4.97 grs. 100 : 4.97 : : 34.19 : x (— 1.702) sulphuric acid. (I) 1000 grs. of urine were supersaturated with ammonia; a bulky precipitate of the earthy phosphates fell, which after ignition weighed 0.65 grs. (m) The filtered liquid supersaturated with lime-water gave a precipitate, which weighed after ignition 3.57 grs. 100": 3.57 : : 49.1 : .r (= 1.753) phosphoric acid, which is in combination with al- kaline bases. To determine the bases a considerable por- tion of urine was evaporated, and the residue burned to whiteness. (/;) 41.5 grs. of the saline residuum left 2.45 grs. insoluble in water. 41.5 — 2.45 = 39.05 alkaline salts. 41.5 : 11.8 (c) : : 2.45 : 0.6956 insoluble salts in 1000 urine; by (I) we found the earthy phosphates 0.65. 11.8 — 0.7 = 11.1 alkaline salts per 1000 urine. (o) The insoluble portion dissolved in a little nitric acid, supersaturated with ammonia and redissolved in acetic acid, gave by oxalate of ammonia a precipitate which yielded on igni- tion 1.32 grs. carbonate of lime. 2.45 : 0.6956 : : 1.32 : x (— 0.3753) carb. lime. 100 : 0.3753 : : 56 : x (= 0.2101) lime. (p) The solution filtered from the oxalate of lime and supersaturated by ammonia gave, on agitation followed by repose for some hours, a crystalline precipitate, weighing 1.18 grs. after ignition.

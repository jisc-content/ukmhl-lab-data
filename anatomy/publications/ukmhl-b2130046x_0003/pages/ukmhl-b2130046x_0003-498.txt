478 MOTION. has been briefly described in the last section, and our limits will not permit further illustra- tions. We shall therefore proceed to the in- vestigation of the leap in the human race. Fig. 269. Preparing to leap with both legs, as designed by Flaxman, In Man the leap is Fig. 270. accomplished with con- siderable expenditure of muscular action, amounting, according to Borelli, to no less than 2900 times the weight of the body;* but since, notwith- standing the increased exertion, the velocity of this kind of motion is much less than in running, it is rarely adopted as a means of continued progression, but rather for passing over the greatest pos- sible space without re- gard to the time taken to accomplish each step. In leaping, either both legs are employed simultaneously to pro- ject the body, as in Jig. 269, or each leg is used alternately. Bo- relli has confined his observations to the former case ; but as Positim gfthe bod a( th} that mode Ot leaping termination of a leap with merely consists of a both legs. * This estimate is calculated by Borelli in the same manner as the force of the muscles in Sec- tion I. On this, as on several other occasions, Barthez has chosen to deny without attempting to disprove the conclusion of Borelli. (Sec Barthez, Nouv. Mecan. p. 97.) succession of isolated movements, there being always a pause between each two, we shall in- vestigate the latter case as the only one which admits of a continued uniform progression, the only one, therefore, which is properly within the scope of the present article.* In the alternate movement of the legs, the swinging leg is not placed on the ground as soon as it has reached the vertical position, as in quickest walking and running, but it is suffered to swing beyond it, and the placing it on the ground is delayed until it comes a second time to the vertical position, consequently the body swings freely in the air for a longer period than in running, whereby a longer step is effected. Fig. 271 represents the various positions of the centre of gravity and of each leg in suc- cessive instants of time : a is the right foot, b the left, and c the centre of gravity, a, 2 3 signifies that while c moves from c1 to c 2 and c„ and b from b, to 6„ and b\, a re- mains at the point a, The spaces a, 2 3, bt s 6 = c2, Cj = &c. the lengths of the steps It will be observed that whilst the body is advancing from c, to c3, it is supported and projected by the right leg. From c3 to ct both legs are off the ground, from c4 to c6 the body is supported and projected by the left leg, and from c6 to c1 both legs are again off the ground, and so on successively. Table 13.

Equations (30) and (35) are omitted, for 9 — o, since the centre of gra- vity of the body does not sink, because at the beginning of each step the leg is bent, and there is, therefore, no depression, as is necessarily the case in walking and running. Instead of equations (31) and (33), we have, 2r = T+g + (l + . 1 ) t 8 h = Oil r (2 - r) (38) (39) The condition for regular progression in leaping, as in walking and running, is that the vital force communicated by the supporting leg to the trunk, equals that communicated by the trunk to the swinging leg. In the present case the latter force is, m! c2 r (2 — r) (40) and the former is the same as in running.

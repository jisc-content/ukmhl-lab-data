They are the warm-blooded fishes of the ancients, or the Cetacea, which, combining the powers of other Mammalia with the advantage of be- ing sustained upon the watery element, include the most gigantic forms to be found in the whole animal creation."â€”Rigne Animal, 2nd edit., p. 65. Having thus given a brief exposition of the principles which have guided five of the most original writers on Natural History in their primary arrangement of Mammalia, we shall next subjoin a short tabular view of the genera or minor groups included by Linnaius and Cuvier in their respective Orders.

The time occupied in running between the raising of the leg from the ground and the setting- it down again is equal to the duration of the step, together with the portion of time during which the body swings in the air; or, it is the time in which c (Jig. 262) advances from c2 to c5, being the time between the raising of the left leg and the setting it down again, but this time is divided into two por- tions, namely, that whilst c Fig. 262.

050 PHARYNX. in the upper lip a projection in the centre, from which a curved line, gently arching upwards, proceeds laterally, while, in the lower, the centre exhibits a depression, and the line from it proceeds in a contrary direction, so that when the mouth is closed these borders are applied evenly to each other: they are of a red colour, turned outwardly, and marked from before backwards by slight wrinkles pro- duced by the contraction of the orbicular muscle; their chief interest to the anatomist is in showing the continuity of the skin with the mucous membrane. Besides the tegu- mentary coverings of skin and mucous mem- brane, these organs contain within their thick- ness the orbicularis muscle, with which are blended the insertions of the greater number of the muscles of the face (see Face), whose varied actions render these features so pecu- liarly expressive of the passions: numerous glands, vessels, and nerves, and an areolar tissue complete their structure. The labial glands constitute a thick lamina between the muscular and mucous layers, producing slight elevations upon the surface of the latter; they resemble the salivary glands in appearance, are of small but varying size, placed close to each other but perfectly distinct, each posses- sing a separate excretory duct, which opens upon the free surface of the mucous mem- brane. The lips are most abundantly supplied with vessels and nerves; the coronary arteries, from the facial, course along their free borders directly beneath the mucous membrane; they also receive numerous twigs from the buccal, infra-orbital, and mental branches of the in- ternal maxillary and submental branch of the facial; the veins accompany the arterial branches; the lymphatics terminate in the glands at the base of the jaw, as evidenced by the frequent enlargement of the latter from the irritation of cancerous or other sores about the lips: the nerves are derived from the portio dura and fifth pair. Use.—The lips are of great importance, more particularly the lower, in retaining the saliva within the cavity of the mouth, and are actively engaged in the acts of sucking and blowing; the utterance of many articulate sounds de- pends chiefly upon their action, and when viewed as organs of expression they are parti- cularly adapted by their extreme mobility to indicate the passing thought. The cheeks (bucca;) form the lateral exten- sible walls of the buccal cavity; examined from the interior of the mouth they will be found limited above and below by the reflexion of their investing mucous membrane upon the external surfaces of the superior and inferior maxillary bones: their superficial surface is bounded behind by the external ear and the posterior border of the lower jaw, below by the horizontal ramus of the same bone ; supe- riorly they may be arbitrarily separated from the temple by the zygoma, and from the orbit by the lower margin of its cavity, and are con- tinued anteriorly into the sides of the nose and lips; they therefore present somewhat of a quadrilateral outline, and in the young and healthy form a rounded projection outwards, but in the emaciated fall in towards the mouth. The skin of the cheek is smooth, thin, and delicate in front and above, and remark- able for its extreme vascularity, as seen in the act of blushing; it is covered behind and below in the adult male with hair, and in the aged its surface is more or less furrowed with wrinkles: the subcutaneous cellular tissue is dense and loaded with a variable quantity of fat, a particularly abundant mass of which is lodged between the buccinator and masseter muscles. The muscular structure of the cheeks has been already described in the article Face. Between the muscles and mucous membrane are irregularly dispersed a considerable num- ber of buccal glands; they are of small size, similar to those of the lips, and like them open upon the mucous surface by separate ducts: these opening's are not likely to be mistaken for that of the parotid duct, which is marked by a very distinct prominence, is of larger size and situated opposite the interval between the second and third molar teeth in the upper jaw : there is an aggregation of several of these buccal glands, imbedded in the fat between the buccinator and masseter muscles, form- ing a larger glandular mass which opens into the mouth opposite the last molar tooth, and has been called the molar gland. The cheeks receive a rich supply of vessels from the facial, transverse facial, and internal maxillary arteries; the veins correspond to these branches and empty themselves into the internal and external jugular veins. The lymphatics probably ter- minate in the glands of the neck. As with other parts of the face, the cheeks derive their nervous filaments from the portio dura and fifth pair. Use.—While the tongue guides the food outwardly to the teeth, the cheeks act in re- taining it between them during mastication; they are employed during the act of sucking, and when distended by air or fluids they are actively engaged in forcibly expelling them, as exemplified in playing upon wind instruments or in squirting liquids from the mouth. The ■palatine arch and gums.—The palatine arch or hard palate forms the greater part of the superior boundary of the buccal cavity : it has a parabolic figure, bounded laterally and in front by the teeth, and is continued poste- riorly into the velum palati without exhibiting any line of demarcation : it presents mesially a whitish ridge, more prominent before than behind, which commences from a small emi- nence situated immediately behind the incisor teeth and corresponding with the lower orifice of the anterior palatine canal; the ridge then extends backwards and is traceable as far as the uvula; from it are passing laterally a vari- able number of transverse ruga;, apparent only at the anterior part of the palate, its buccal surface being, in the greater part of its extent, perfectly smooth. The palatine arch is framed by the palate processes of the superior maxil- lary and palate bones,* and invested on their * See Face.

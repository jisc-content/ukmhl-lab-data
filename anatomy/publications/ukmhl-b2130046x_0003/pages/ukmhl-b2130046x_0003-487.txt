Duration of Duration of Duration of Step. Standing.

This gives rise to an- other range of experiments which have been made by the Messrs. Weber with the same design, of which the following table is the result.'* Table 11.

When the hinder leg has quitted the ground, it swings forward by its own gravity, in conse- quence of its freedom of motion in the ilio- femoral articulation and its oblique position ; and, in order that the body may be supported, it must, at least, move so far forwards that the foot may arrive at a position vertically under the head of the femur; for in that direction the leg not only supports the body with least effort, but it is also in that position that it can most easily avoid any impediment in its path by transferring the point of support to any por- tion of the sole of the foot, particularly if the latter be turned outwards, which gives a greater security than when it is directed parallel to the line of motion. The weight of the swinging leg and the velocity of the trunk serve to give the impulse by which the foot attains a position vertical to the head of the thigh bone; but as the latter, according to the laws of the pendu- lum, requires, in the quickest walking, a given time to attain that position, or half its entire curve of oscillation, it follows that every person has a certain measure for his steps, and a cer- tain number of steps in a given time which in his natural gait in walking he cannot exceed. We can easily ascertain the time it requires to accomplish the quickest step in walking, which is equal to the half vibration of the leg made with relaxed muscles. In order to make the steps follow each other in much slower succes- sion, the foot is not placed on the ground when it arrives in the perpendicular position, or the half oscillation from behind forwards as in the rapid pace, but we plant it on the ground somewhat later when the foot has described more than half the curve of vibration. From these principles we conclude that the man in fig. 255 walks much faster than that in fig. 256; in fact the former makes steps 27.559 in. in length, whereas in the latter the steps are barely 23.622 in. in length; and whereas the first makes a step in 0".35, the second takes 0".422 for a step, so that the velocity of fig. 255 is nearly double that of fig. 256. These figures are represented as walking on the toes, as if the foot always touched the ground in the same position, and their steps are shorter than when the entire sole is brought into action. Fig. 255 shows the greatest step which it is possible to make with the toes. The steps are shortest in fig. 257, in which the difference of the heights of the centre of gravity, compared with that of fig. 255, may be easily seen.* In figs. 258, 259, and 260, the legs are of * These figures, with the others upon the same plan, reduced to ^th the natural size, are drawn in accordance with the principles on which the theories of walking, running, and leaping are based. They are taken in the various instants of a step as seen through a revolving disc, con- structed upon the principles of the stroboscope in- vented by Dr. Faraday, and modified so as to apply to these purposes by Stamplier.t These t Vide Foggendorff's Ann vol. 22. p. 600. 2 n 2

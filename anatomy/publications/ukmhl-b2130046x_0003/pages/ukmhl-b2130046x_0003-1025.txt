PERINEUM. 923 est deviation to either side brings the correspond- ing vas deferens and vesicula seminalis into peril. In the majority of full-grown subjects the space under consideration is about three inches distant from the anus, so as to permit the index finger of the operator to reach it without difficulty; but from statements already made the reader will perceive that many excep- tions to this rule may be encountered in prac- tice. Again, the sides and base of this triangle (so long as the neighbouring parts remain in situ) are in general each of them respectively less than one inch in length; yet when the bladder is removed from the subject and artifi- cially distended, and when the connections of the peritoneum are disturbed by dissection, the space to which we refer becomes immensely enlarged, and the anatomist is then apt to form a most exaggerated and erroneous idea of its natural dimensions. Against the recto-vesical paracentesis many very serious objections may be raised. In early life it should not be attempted, because at that period the peritoneum descends so low, and the under surface of the bladder is so little developed, that injury to the serous membrane of the abdomen would almost necessarily en- sue. Even in the adult the great uncertainty of the depth of the peritoneal cul-de-sac, added to the utter impossibility of ascertaining its extent in the living subject, constitutes a weighty argument against the operation ; whilst the enlarged prostate (so very common in old men) must frequently forbid its performance in after life; and the danger of wounding the vas deferens or the vesicula seminalis, or of pro- ducing urinary infiltration or a permanent fis- tula, may be fairly urged against this mode of relieving the bladder, at whatever age under- taken. The other methods employed for the same purpose in extreme cases of retention of urine are also no doubt open to valid objec- tions, but any further consideration of this subject would be out of place in the present article. In order to perform lithotomy successfully, or to tap the bladder with safety, the surgeon should ever bear in mind the direction of the axis of that organ. In the adult male the axis of the bladder runs nearly parallel to the axis of the upper strait of the pelvis; but upon a lower plane, that is to say, nearer to the pubis, if produced, it would pass superiorly through the linea alba between the umbilicus and the pubis, and it would touch the inferior extre- mity of the coccyx below. In the child its direction is very variable, for the urinary reser- voir being then in the abdomen and in contact with the anterior wall of that cavity, must necessarily move in obedience to the abdominal muscles, and every change of position which the bladder undergoes exerts a marked influ- ence upon its axis. During childhood the axis of the bladder appears in the dead subject, to run from before backwards nearly horizontally, be- cause the distended bladder, no longer sup- ported by the abdominal muscles, turns for- wards over the pubis; but in the living child, when the recti abdominis are forcibly con- tracted, the line in question becomes nearly vertical. The urethra.â€” Anatomists describe the urethra as a canal presenting a double curva- ture, of which the anterior segment is highly moveable, and of which the posterior is in a great measure fixed. The anterior segment (comprising the spongy portion of the urethra from the meatus urinanus to the vicinity of the bulb) exhibits, in the flaccid condition of the penis, a marked curvature concave downwards, which disappears, however, during erection, and which exerts little influence upon catheterism, since the surgeon easily obliterates it by raising the penis until it forms an angle of about forty degrees with the anterior wall of the abdomen. The posterior segment (consisting of the whole of the prostatic and membranous portions of the urethra, and also of the posterior part of its spongy portion) presents on the contrary a permanent curvature concave upwards, and belonging essentially to the perineum, it re- quires in this place a special description. To dissect the perineal portion of the urethra with advantage, the anatomist ought to remove the greater part of the ossa pubis and the ascending rami of the ischia from a recent subject, with the penis, the bladder, and the rectum attached ; this can be easily accomplished by cutting the horizontal ramus of the pubis at each side perpendicularly with a saw as near the aceta- bulum as possible, after which the instrument may be made to traverse the foramen ovale, and divide the ramus of the ischium in the immediate vicinity of its tuberosity. If the bladder be then inflated from one of the ureters, and the rectum distended, the preparation will exhibit in a satisfactory manner the urethra and many other parts described in this article, of which but an imperfect view is obtained in the ordinary dissection of the perineum from below. The posterior segment of the urethra repre- sents a reversed arch, of which the centre lies about ten lines beneath the symphysis pubis, whilst the extremities incline upwards, the one in front and the other behind the symphysis. Ample provisions exist to render this arch per- manent; its centre, constituted by the mem- branous portion of the urethra, is transmitted through the triangular ligament, and adheres by its circumference to the edges of the opening through which it passes; its posterior extre- mity, formed by the prostatic urethra, is tied up to the back of the pubis by the anterior true ligaments of the bladder, whilst the true sus- pensory ligament of the penis in front, and the prolonged attachments of the crura penis, pin- ning that organ up to the anterior surface of the pubis, raise the spongy portion of the urethra at its commencement, and consequently elevate the anterior extremity of the arch. The per- manency of this arch depends of course mainly upon the strength and resistance of the afore- said ligaments; yet, although the properties of these structures are well known to anatomists, a difference of opinion prevails as to the pos-

MICROSCOPE. 357 minute, which is not capable of being resolved into smaller particles, as far as our means of observation can carry us; and the absurdity of the particular dimensions assumed is further shown by the fact, now well known, that there are very numerous species, and countless indi- viduals, among the Polygastric animalcules, whose whole bulk is much less than that of one of the so-called ultimate particles, and which contain within this a considerable number of different organs. The following statements made some years since by Ehrenberg will give a very good idea of the mode in which the size of such organs and of their component parts may be approximately known, when they are themselves too minute for measurement. "I could plainly distinguish with a micro- scope magnifying nearly 800 diameters, Mo- nads, which were filled with colouring nutritive substances, and which possessed voluntary mo- tions, but the entire and greatest diameter of whose body only amounted to the 1555th or 3555th of a Parisian line. I could perceive in the largest individuals of this form as many as six, and in the smallest as many as four, in- ternal sacs coloured blue by indigo, which at times did not occupy half the internal dimen- sion of the animal. Such a sac, therefore, of an animalcule measuring -j^jth of a line, and if we suppose only four sacs occupying the half of it, (therefore not one of the smallest,) is 15555th of a line in size. Further, if we suppose the single colouring particles, with which the stomachs are filled, not to be nume- rous, it would be against all probability not to think that they were filled by several particles. Let us, however, only suppose each sac to be filled with three colouring atoms,—which, from the roundness made perceptible by the motion communicated to them when diffused through the water, we may well admit,—this alone affords a proof of the existence of material colouring particles of red and dark blue moving freely in water, which measure 35555th of a line, or 335555th part of an inch in diameter; and calculating these objects from the smallest of the animalcules, which by actual observation were found to be 5555th of a line in size, and which sometimes contained four coloured points in the hinder part of the body, these particles, which cannot be distinguished individually by the eye with a magnifying power of 800, but which are yet to be recognized as corporeal, would amount to ^g^th of a line, or 57S55„th of an inch. Further, the smaller monad-stomachs are seen isolated in the body, and with sharp outlines. In larger Infusoria, which are ^th of a line, or more, in diameter, these internal receptacles are recognized as evi- dent membranaceous sacs, which often make their appearance isolated, when the animalcule is pressed, or when it divides itself, and which have been supposed to be separate infusoria, internal monads. It can be distinctly seen that, when two such digestive sacs touch one another, the thickness of the partition between them is, in comparison with the diameter of the stomach, extremely small, so that the former is scarcely perceptible ; it may be reckoned as at the most 35th of the latter, Granting, how- ever, the thickness of the partition to be as much as T'5th the diameter of the sac, this would amount to ^mtb of a line, or 7555555 th of an inch, in monads 5555th of a line in size, in which the stomachs measure but one- eighth of the whole length of the body, and are therefore -,5555th of a line in diameter." When similar views are extended to the young of the species on which this calculation is founded, or to smaller species in the existence of which there is good reason to believe, the minuteness of structure thus disclosed becomes still more wonderful. " Let not these calcu- lations," it is justly remarked by Ehrenberg, " be regarded as playful ; they are so far in earnest, that they are founded on the contem- plation of nature, and are not to be considered as a groundless speculation. They plainly de- monstrate an unfathomableness of organic life in the direction of the smallest conceivable space; and if the word infinity be too much for what we know at present, let the •word unfa- thomableness, which I have purposely em- ployed, avert from me the reproach of exagge- ration, and establish the direction which the physical, chemical, and physiological enquiries of our days, should they be rendered fruitful by new powers, have to take, and what deviations they have to avoid." To these enquiries Ehrenberg has subjoined an attempt to calculate the power of vision for the human eye, and the ultimate power of the microscope. From his experiments on the smallest square magnitudes which are ordina- rily visible at any distance by the human eye, he finds that they vary in different cases from ugth to yigth of a line ; but when strongly il- luminated, much smaller bodies can be seen, metallic particles of ^th of an inch being visible in common daylight; and non-transpa- rent threads of ^th of a line in thickness being distinguished, when held between the eye and the light. Hence the size of the mi- nutest objects visible with a given magnifying power of the microscope might be determined by dividing their apparent dimensions, as just stated, by the magnifying power; thus no square corpuscles of less dimension than 3So0th or fjggiti of a line could be seen with a magnifying power of 100 diameters. In practice, however, owing to the degree of im- perfection which must necessarily attend the best-constructed instruments, the minuteness of the smallest visible objects cannot be judged of entirely by this rule ; since, in order that it should be correct, it is necessary that the object of ^g'r^th or 3555th of a line in dia- meter, should be represented to the eye as clearly by a microscope magnifying 100 dia- meters, as a real object of ^th or ^th of a line would be; this is very far from being the case, owing to the loss of light by reflection in passing through the lenses, as well as to the errors of the lenses themselves, which can never be perfectly corrected. With a magnifying power of 1000, which is perhaps the highest that has yet been employed to real advantage, the minutest particle which could possibly bo

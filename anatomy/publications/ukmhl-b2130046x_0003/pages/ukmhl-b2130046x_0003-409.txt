The principal difference occurs in the place of termination of the pancreatic duct, which, in the Ornithoihynchus, joins the ductus chole- dochus, but in the Echidna terminates sepa- rately in the duodenum and nearer the pylorus than does the ductus choledochus. The arrangement of the hepatic and pan- creatic ducts is thus conformable to the Mam- malian type, and the Oinithorhynchus, in the place of the junction of these ducts near the commencement of the ductus choledochus, ma- nifests its affinity to the Marsupials, as the same structure occurs in the Dasyure. The spleen (Jig. 187, u, u) consists of two lobes bent upon each other at an acute angle, Submaxillari/ glands. Echidna selosa {Original.) in which the Monotremes again resemble the Marsupials. In the Ornithorhynclius the ante- rior and right lobe is four inches long, the pos- terior and left lobe two inches and a half; the right lobe is bent upon itself. In the Echidna, besides the two lobes which are continued for- wards from the left side, there is a third shorter descending appendage.* The lobes are thin and moderately broad in both Monotremes, and in structure, size, situation, and general figure, the spleen conforms to the Mammalian type, al- though this is exhibited under a more than usual complication of external form.

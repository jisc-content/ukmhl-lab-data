During the depression of the wing the bird is drawn downwards by the force W, arising from its own M2 weight, and by the resistance of the air to its rising, namely, it k s —7 but it is driven upwards by the resistance which the air opposes to the motion of the wing, that is, it K A ^ "\, hence the equation to the motion will be W du v .

The motion of the wing being very quick, we may consider « to be constant during a depression, and if u0, ul be the values of u, at the beginning and end of the depression, equation (12) will become 2 W («,—«0) = t { w K A (V—«0) 2 — it ks ul — 2 W g} (13) Similarly if wv w2 be the values of u at the beginning and end of an elevation, the equation for the motion will be 2 W (a2 — tit)=—i/{wK'A'(V + «,)2 + „ k s 2 Wg} (14) By adding the two latter equations together we have 2W(«3-w0)=T{*rKA(V-u0y>—wfes«2-2Wg}-T'{^K'A'(V'+Hiy+^ ^* «I+2 W^}.. (15) Since, at the end of every flapping the wings are supposed to be in the same position as they were at the beginning of it, we must have V t = V r (16) The two equations (15) and (16) express the conditions under which the bird may acquire a given motion, the nature of which is shown by the variation n2 — u0 which the velocity u undergoes in the time t + t'. If we suppose the motion of the bird to be uniform during each flapping u0z=ul = u2, and if we take the value of V in equation (16), equation (15) will become 0 = * V it K A (V — «0)2—it K' A' (Vt + m0t')2—(t+t) t' n k s m02—(t + t') t' 2 W g. . .(17) In order to fly, the bird must expend a quantity of force sufficient to overcome the resistance of the air to the motion of the wings, and, considering the velocity of the bird to be constant during each movement of the wings, the quantity of force expended in a depression will be 7rKA(V-Q2VT> and in an elevation itK'A'CC+JhTv'r: If we now suppose «0 =«i as before, and substitute the value of V, we shall have for the whole force expended in an unit of time A KA(V-«0HK1/VT+V'Y \ (18) 2g (T + T ) ( \ T / > Let t' = p r, and K'A' = q K A, equation (17) then becomes h « 2 W tr 0 = p (Y-u0y-q (V + uB p)2 - (P + ]>2) |L£ ul - (P + /»=) ±2LL * V ami V are supposed constant during the times of elevation and depression, respectively, and are referred to the centres of the wings.

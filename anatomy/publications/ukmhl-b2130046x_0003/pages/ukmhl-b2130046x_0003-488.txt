A- + f = P. t T = T COS — /. 1 ('+"): These three equations, which are deduced from the general formulas, are intended to express the principal data upon which the theory of walking is based. If n == v = 1, and fl = o, and we substitute for //. its value as deduced from experi- ment in walking, and let (,u -(- 1) g = 34 .66,t T — 0",7 and / = 0.95 met. by substituting these values in the equations above we get the following results which accord very closely with experiment.

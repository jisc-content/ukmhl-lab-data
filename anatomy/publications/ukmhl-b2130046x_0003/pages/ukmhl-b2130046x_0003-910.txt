ORGANIC ANALYSIS. 810 example, furnished from a patient suffering from a chronic cerebral affection. (a) The entire blood employed amounted to 6735 grs.; it had been drawn 24 hours, and had formed a tolerably firm but flat coagulum, which weighed 3560 grs. The serum that had separated weighed 3175 grs., and had a sp. gr. of 1029.3. The proportions of clot and serum were therefore as follows, in 1000 parts. 6735 : 1000 : : 3560 : x (=528.6)coagulum. 6735 : 1000 : : 3175 : x (= 471.4) serum. The analysis divides itself into two portions, that of the serum, and that of the clot. Analysis of the serum. (b) 200 grs. of serum were dried at a tem- perature of 212°. The residue amounted to 18.69grs. 200 : 1000 : : 18.69 : x (= 93.45) solids in serum. Therefore 1000 — 93.45 = 906.55, water in the serum. (c) The residue was incinerated over the cir- cular wicked spirit lamp, and amounted to 1.46 grs. 200 : 1000 :: 1.46 : x (= 7.3) saline matters. {d) 500 grains of serum were dried in a pla- tinum capsule, the dry mass carefully detached, pulverized, and digested in boiling ether, which was decanted and renewed three or four times. The ethereal solutions evaporated left 0.35 grs. of fatty matter; of this cold alcohol dissolved 0.12 oily fat, leaving 0.23 of crystalline fats. 1000 parts of serum therefore contain 0.24 oily fat, and 0.46 crystalline futs. (e) The undissolved residue was heated to expel adhering ether and treated with boiling water. It was thrown on a filter and washed repeatedly, until nitrate of silver produced an insignificant cloud when applied to a few drops of the washings. The filter and its con- tents were dried ; when weighed the albumen amounted to 41.73 grs. 10 grs. when incinerated yielded 0.19 grs. of ash ; 10 : 41.73 :: 0.19 : x (= 0.79287.) 41.73 — 0.793 = 40.937 ; 40.937 X 2 = 81.974 albumen. ( /') The filtered liquid evaporated weighed 4.66 grs. It was digested with alcohol, which was renewed as long as any thing was dis- solved. The alcoholic solution evaporated amounted to 3.32 grs. (If urea, sugar, or bile be present, they will be contained in this extract and must be sought for in the usual manner.) 4.66 — 3.32 = 1.34 grs. watery extract, 1.34 X 2 = 2.68. 1 gr. of watery extract incinerated left 0.82 grs. of salts, and U : 2.68 : 0.82 : * = 2.197, and 2.68 — 2.197 = 0.483 watery extract per 1000. (g) 1.4 grs. of alcoholic extract, incinerated, left 1.00 grs. of saline matter. Now 1.4 : 1 : : 6.64 : x (= 4.74) saline matters, And 6.64 — 4.74 = 1.90 alcoholic extract per 1000. The serum therefore consists of Water 906.550 Fixed salts 7.300 Albumen 81.974 Alcoholic extract 1.900 Watery extract 0.483 Fats, oily 0.240 „ crystalline 0.460 998.907 Analysis o f the clot. (/() 1000 grs. shred finely with a sharp knife were tied in a piece of calico and washed till colourless under a gentle stream of water. The fibrin that remained carefully dried at 212° weighed 5.67 grs. Ether dissolved from this 0.07 grs. of oily fat. The pure fibrin therefore amounted to 5.60 grs. 1000 : 528.6 : : 5.6 : x (= 2.962)fibrin. 1000 : 528.6 by (a) : : 0.07 : x (= 0.04) J at from fibrin. («) 500 grs. of the coagulum completely dried at 212° left a residue of 143.6 grs. 500 : 528.6 : : 143.6 ; x (= 151.81) solids in the clot. (k) 528.6 —151.8 = 376.8 water in the clot. Supposing the water entirely due to the serum with which the clot is penetrated, we should find it contain— Since by (6) 906.55 : 376.8 : : 93.45 : x (~ 38.86) solids of the serum retained by the clot, and 376.8 + 38.86 = 415.66 weight of the serum retained. But 415.66 + 471.4 by (a) = 887.06 total serum in 1000 parts of blood. (I) 20 grs. of the dried matter of the coagu- lum ignited left a red ash, weighing 0.52 grs. 20 : 151.81 : : 0.52 : x (= 3.947) salts in the clot. But 1000:471.4 :: 7.3 by (c) : x {= 3.441) salts in the exuded serum. 3.947 + 3.441 = 7.388 salts in 1000 parts of blood. (;n) Since the coagulum contains 2.962 fibrin, And the serum retained 38.860 solids. The sum of the two = 41,822 And by deducting this sum from the total solids contained in the clot we find 151.81 — 41.822 = 109.988 red particles in 1000 of blood. (n) In order therefore to deduce the compo- sition of 1000 parts of blood, we have only to calculate the following proportions from our knowledge of the composition of the serum. 1000 : 887.06 : : 906.55 : x (= 804.164) water. 1000 : 887.06 :: 81.974 : x (= 72.716) albumen. 1000 : 887.06 : : 1.900 : x (= 1.685) alco- holic extract. 1000 : 887.06 : : 0.483 : x (= 0.428) watery extract. 1000: 887.06 : : 0.24 : x (= 0.213) oily fat. To this we must add 0 04 from the fibrin, making the total oily Jut = 0.253.

We have seen at the Richmond Hospital two similar cases of this very curious result of necrosis of the tibia. In these examples the knee-joint had partici- pated in the inflammation of the contiguous structure, and great deformity of the whole limb was the consequence (fig. 7). The subject of one of these cases (Christopher Tarrer, ast. 30) died of erysipelas, which was idiopathic, and had no connexion with the deformity. The knee- joint was examined, and the patella was found dislocated outwards, and anchylosed to the outer surface of the external condyle of the femur (fig. 8.) The superior extremity ofthe tibia was partially displaced backwards, and was greatly deformed and enlarged, particularly the outer condyle of this bone, the anterior half of which was deeply excavated to receive the condyle of the femur; the posterior half of this condyle was free and had no bone in contact with it; but this portion of the tibia and the head of the fibula were so much rotated or twisted out- wards and backwards as to form a very conspi- cuous elevation in the lower part of the popli- teal space. The fibula was placed directly behind the tibia. The lateral ligament did not exist. The ligamentum patellae was greatly

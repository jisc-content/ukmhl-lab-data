PERINEUM. 920 capacity is so limited that the viscera which occupy the pelvis of the adult are mostly con- tained in the abdominal cavity of the infant. The straits of the pelvis have each of them likewise an aspect different from that of the adult; in the child the superior aperture looks much more directly forwards, and the inferior aperture much more backwards than they do after puberty. These peculiarities are inherent in the infantile pelvis: they are independent of any inclination in the vertebral column, and they must therefore modify considerably the direction of the pelvic axes during the early years of growth. In the old subject again the superior aperture is once more directed forwards as in the infant, whilst the inferior aperture inclines backwards; at this period of life, however, the change in the pelvis arises not from any intrinsic alteration in its bony parietes, but simply from the senile curvature of the spine above, added to the ha- bitual flexion of the hip and knee-joints below, so constantly observed in the aged individual. To understand the course of the rectum and the urethra, as well as the relations of the base of the bladder, the anatomist must study these parts within the pelvis, since it is impossible to display them satisfactorily in the ordinary dissection of the perineum; much assistance may be derived from preparations affording a side view of the pelvic viscera, and one of the most useful is an antero-posterior section carried through the middle line and dividing the ure- thra, prostate gland, bladder, and rectum, &c, after these organs have been moderately dis- tended and hardened by alcohol. Rectum.â€”The portion of intestine which belongs to this region commences at the great cul-de-sac of the peritoneum and terminates at the anus. It is perfectly devoid of any serous investment, and presents considerable varieties in size and direction in different subjects. The age and the habits of the individual are found to exert a remarkable influence upon its course and dimensions, and accidental variations in the line of reflection of the serous membrane, which create corresponding changes in the depth of the perineum, are occasionally ob- served even in the adult, and ought to be taken into account by the operator. The great cul de-sac of the peritoneum is usually about three-and-a-half inches distant from the anus, so that, making allowance for the curved course of the intestine, we may estimate the length of the perineal portion of the rectum in the adult at somewhat less than four inches. In forming this estimate, the condition of the urinary bladder as regards its distension should not be overlooked, for when that reservoir is empty and contracted, the rec- tum receives an extensive serous investment, and at such times the cul-de-sac of the perito- neum approaches the anus perceptibly, whilst under the opposite condition (that of repletion) the bladder displaces the serous membrane par- tially, carrying its cul-de-sac upwards towards the abdomen. Individual varieties, irrespec- tive of these changes in the bladder, are, how- ever, of constant occurrence, and in many in- stances the rectum in the adult is covered by serous membrane anteriorly to within two inches of the anus, the bladder being at the same time fully distended. In the young subject the peritoneum stretches very far downwards along the surface of the bowel, and at birth it very generally covers the front of the rectum to within one inch of the anus; at the age of five years the cul-de-sac of the peritoneum and the anus are still separated by a very trifling interval; but from this period up to puberty the intermediate distance gradually in- creases, pari passu, with the growth of the pelvis and the developement of the inferior fundus of the bladder. At its commencement the perineal portion of the rectum runs obliquely downwards and for- wards, this direction it maintains as far as the prostate gland, but it there alters its course and turns slightly backwards to terminate at the anus. Superiorly it presents a slight curva- ture concentric with that of the sacrum, so that the anterior surface of the gut is there slightly concave, and its posterior surface slightly convex from above downwards: infe- riorly, however, the curvature of the intestine is reversed; it appears as it were to turn round the point of the coccyx to gain the anus, and therefore the convexity of the lower part of the gut is directed forwards whilst its concavity looks backwards. This curved course of the rectum ought to be borne in mind by the sur- geon in his attempts to introduce instruments into its interior. In the child the sacrum and coccyx present but a trifling curvature, and therefore the rec- tum reaches the anus by a less circuitous route than that just described, and which is the nor- mal condition in the adult; during childhood the inclination backwards of the lower extre- mity of the gut scarcely exists, it possesses but a single curve concave forwards, which, like that of the sacrum and coccyx, is but faintly marked, so that the intestine is much straighter in early life than after puberty. In old age the rectum immediately above the anus is sometimes in- flected from side to side so as to assume a zigzag appearance: these lateral inclinations are the result of the enormous enlargement which the bowel occasionally undergoes in the ad- vanced periods of life, its length being actually increased at the same time that its cavity is dilated. In the adult subject the rectum is somewhat cylindrical in shape, but it increases in capacity as it descends, and presents a marked dilatation just above the sphincters, whilst the anus and so much of the gut as is embraced by those muscles exhibit a decided contraction. In the child the dilatation just described is but little marked, whilst in advanced life it very fre- quently becomes excessive, and is best appre- ciated when the intestine is fully distended with faeces or artificially inflated ; under such cir- cumstances the anterior wall of the rectum is hollowed into a deep depression or gutter, in which the prostate gland and base of the bladder are imbedded, and the bowel swells outwards and forwards upon each side of the prostate,

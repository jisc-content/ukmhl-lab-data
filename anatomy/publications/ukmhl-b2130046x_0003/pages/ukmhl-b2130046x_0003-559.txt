539 MUSCULAR SYSTEM. articulated appendages, the legs and wings, must undergo a still further improvement, and the means whereby this is accomplished are sufficiently manifest. The nervous ganglia are accumulated into a few large and powerful centres oT innervation ; the rings of the body, to which the locomotive organs are attached, are dilated and strengthened in proportion to the force of the muscles placed within, and constitute three thoracic rings of such firmness and inflexibility that they may well be looked upon as forming a distinct division of the exo- skeleton, and give rise to the distinction laid down by entomologists betweeen the head, the thoracic, and the abdominal segments that enter into the composition of an insect's body. But the same concentration of the nervous system, which permits an Insect to possess the extraor- dinary powers of flight with which it is gifted, allows by the increased perfection givea to the brain, the possession of elaborately con- structed senses. The eyes assume a complexity of structure that is truly wonderful, the sense of touch attains extreme delicacy, and indubita- bly the means of smelling, of tasting, and of hearing are now conferred, however incapable we may be of pointing out the mode in which they are exercised ; nay, it is extremely proba- ble that capabilities of perception of which we can form no idea, are bestowed upon the Insect races commensurate with the activity of their movements and the wide range of duties they are appointed to perform. During the metamorphosis to which Insects are subject, that is to say during the advance- ment of these creatures from an embryo condi- tion to their mature or perfect state, changes are constantly in progress, both in the nature and arrangement of the locomotive organs, and of course as these changes are effected, the entire disposition and even the vital properties of the muscular system appropriated to their movements undergo a considerable modification. The lame of many genera have externally the appearance of the simplest worm, being pro- vided with not even any vestiges of the loco- motive apparatus that subsequently is to be developed : even the rings or segments of the body are entirely soft, the cuticular covering being of extreme tenuity, and the tegumentary muscles, as a natural consequence, propor- tionally rudimentary in their structure. In such larvae the nervous system exhibits the lowest condition found among the apodous An- nelidans, and the eyes and external senses are, if they exist at all, of the humblest possible character. This is the case, for example, in the maggots of many Dipterous and Hymenop- terous Insects. In others, as for instance in the caterpillars of the Lepidoptera, the locomotive powers are of a slightly ameliorated description : the larva possesses a distinct head, and to the succeeding segments, rudely constructed limbs named legs, and others bearing still less resemblance to the locomotive members of the future insect, to which the name of pro-legs has been appro- priated, are the only instruments of progression. Even in the most perfect larvae, as in those of the aquatic Beetles, the form is elongated and resembles that of an Annelidan ; the legs are comparatively feeble and of small size, and simple ocelli replace the compound eyes that afterwards become developed in the perfect Insect. During the progress of the metamorphosis, the nervous system within is undergoing a pro- cess of concentration precisely comparable to that which has been noticed in advancing from the lower to the higher classes of Articulata. The ganglia coalesce and become less numerous, the encephalic pair attain a higher development, and as this is accomplished the legs and wings of the mature being sprout from the sides of the segments appropriated to sustain them, enclosed in and defended by cases of cuticle temporarily provided, which constitute the covering of the pupa or chrysalis, until at length, the aggregation of the previously sepa- rated ganglia being completed and the brain perfected to the extent required, jjie pupa-case is thrown off, the newly-formed limbs expand, and the insect, with its newly-acquired limbs, pos- sesses an additional system of muscles, which have been developed with their growth, and only arrive at their full state of perfection when the body has ceased to grow, and the genera- tive system, having attained its complete pro portions, proclaims the animal mature and able to propagate its species. The addition of wings, indeed, to the body of flying insects would seem to be a provision specially connected with the distribution of the progeny to which they are to give birth, and all the phenomena connected with their develop- ment and that of the muscular apparatus pro- vided for their movements to have relation to this great and closing act of the insect's exist- ence. The period of time during which these animals live in their imperfect or wingless state, during which many of them have important offices assigned to them, constitutes, in most cases, by far the longest portion of their lives, and some aquatic larvae, indeed, reside for months or even years in the water under their immature or wingless form, which perish in a few hours after they have been gifted with the means of aerial locomotion. Had they never been furnished with wings, it is abundantly evident that the species of such insects could never have been dispersed beyond the precincts of the pond or the ditch in which the parent had passed her existence, but the brief space allowed them to enjoy life in the winged con- dition is sufficient for the achievement of the great object in view, and the Ep/wmeron and the little Gnat, while they appear to be only sporting out their evening's life amid the sun- beams, are, in fact, disseminating their offspring through different localities. The next class of IIomogangliate animals comprises the Arachnidans, the Scorpions and the Spiders, animals visibly intended to be destroyers, appointed to keep within due limits the different races of the Insect world, and by assisting in the great work of destruction that is on all sides in progress against them, to prevent their fertility from

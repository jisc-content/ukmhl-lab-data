MOTION. 474 the attitude of the annexed design by Flaxman (fig. 266), in which it will be seen that the whole mass of the body lies posterior to the vertical line a c b, passing through the base of support, whereas the preceding theory shews that in quick walking and running the swinging leg never passes beyond the vertical d c, which cuts the head of the femur. This figure has therefore been drawn upon false principles. Table 12. A Table of fifty-six experiments on running with various velocities. Space passed through 43.43 met. — 142-2501 feet.

In quick running the length of step rapidly increases, whilst the duration slowly dimi- nishes; but in slow running the length dimi- nishes rapidly, whilst the time remains nearly the same. The time of a step in quick run- ning, compared to that in quick walking, is nearly as two to three, whilst the lengths of the steps are as two to one, consequently a person can run in a given time three times as fast as he can walk. The velocity in running is usually at the rate of about ten miles in an hour, but there are many persons who for a limited period can exceed this velocity. In the human race, however, the velocity in running varies considerably, depending on a variety of physical conditions, such as age, sex, stature, muscular power, the nature of the surface on which the progression is performed, and the angle of elevation above, or depression below the plane of the horizon. Man is ex- ceeded in speed_by many of the lower animals, owing to differences in the structure of the locomotive organs, and the physical laws which they obey. Leaping or jumping.—This mode of pro- gression is adopted by a great number of animals; some of which resort to it only for the accomplishment of a particular object, others as a regular means of locomotion. In most of the orders of the animal king- dom there are some species which transfer themselves from place to place by a succession of impulses, in air, in water, and on solids : it is to the latter we shall confine our attention, having already briefly mentioned the former in the sections on flying and swimming. In leaping, the object to be attained is to take the greatest length of step without refer- ence to its duration ; and herein it differs from running, in which the greatest steps are taken in the least possible time. The height to which animals of different orders are capable of springing* varies, but, according to Strans-Durckheim, all those in the same order leap to equal elevations. Amongst insects, the Grasshopper and Cricket, and in the order Felis, the Cat, the Leopard, and the Tiger, all rise to the same elevations above the positions of their respective centres of gravity at the instant when their feet quit the ground. This appears at first to be inconsistent with the computations made on the proportion of the force of muscles to the mass of animals of different dimensions. If we select four diffe- rent animals of the same order, in which the dimensions of one kind are as 1, 2, 3, 4, their weights will be as the cubes of these numbers, or, as 1, 8, 27, 64 ; but since the force of a muscle depends on the number of its fibres, and therefore increases in the ratio of its transverse section ; that is, as the square of one of these dimensions, the muscular forces of the animals will be as 1, 4,9,16, and the velocities (supposing the muscles to act instantaneously) will be as the forces divided by the weights,'or as 1, \, J, \, and the heights of the leaps being as the squares of the velocities would be as 1, \, ^, Now, as they are all found to arrive at the same height, this may be ex- plained by supposing that the muscles do not act instantaneously, but as constantly accele- rating forces during thecontinuanceof the spring. The force on an unit of mass in the Cat is to that on an unit in the Tiger, as 1 to |; and since the dimensions of the latter are four times those of the former, the tiger passes through four times the space the Cat passes over, reckoned from the beginning to the end of the time the muscles act, until the animal quits the ground, and therefore is elevated to the same height as the cat f From these principles we see the reason why * The spring is that portion of the leap which takes place before the feet quit the ground. t Thus :—Let « — the space passed through during the spring of the cat, / = the muscular force employed in the time t of a spring, then, by equation (3), s = \ft*. Now, as the tiger passes through a space = As,

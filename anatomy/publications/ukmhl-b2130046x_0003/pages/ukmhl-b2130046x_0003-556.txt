MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 536 transparency and smooth surface, and under the highest powers of the microscope present neither an appearance of cross markings nor of a linear arrangement of globules." Besides the retractor muscles in the Bryozoa there like- wise exists a muscular membrane which lines the cell, and forms the parietes of the body, in which fibres are distinctly apparent, running transversely: these by their contraction com- pressing the visceral cavity and the fluid which it contains will tend to elongate the body of the Bryozoon, and assist in effecting its protru- sion ; although, as Dr. Farre supposes, this process is principally accomplished by the cooperation of the alimentary canal, which has the power of straightening itself from the sig- moid flexure, into which it is thrown when the animal is retracted. The condition of the nervous system in the Bryozoa has not been as yet made out, a cir- cumstance at which no one will be surprised who considers the extreme difficulty of micro- scopic researches concerning the structure of animals so minute as these ; but from the close affinity that there decidedly is between these animals and the Rotifera, there can be little doubt that a similar arrangement exists in both. In the Rotifera or Wheel Animalcules, the nervous system, according to Ehrenberg, con- sists of several filaments communicating with minute ganglia dispersed in different parts of the body, although without any obvious arrange- ment or symmetrical disposition, so that the muscular apparatus in these beautiful animals presents itself in a very perfect state of deve- lopement. The ciliated organs around the mouth, which are apparently the representatives of the ciliated arms in the Bryozoa, are retracted by a special set of muscles derived from the in- terior of the membrane that lines the shell and circumscribes the visceral cavity,and the antago- nists to these are the delicate parietes of the visceral cavity itself, which acting upon the fluid therein contained, causes the extrusion of the ciliated lobes, whenever the wheel-like organs are required to be put in motion.* But besides the muscular bands, that, in the Rotifera, are appropriated to the protrusion and retraction of the wheel-bearing organs, others are connected with a peculiar prehensile apparatus placed at the hinder extremity of the body, and forming an instrument of very great importance in the economy of these creatures. It consists of a prehensile forceps, the blades of which are worked by distinct muscles; and by the assistance of this organ the action of the wheel-like cilia is at once changed from that of a locomotive power into a means of procuring and seizing food. If these forceps are not * It seems more than probable that the tranverse muscular fibres that occur in the parieal membrane of the Rotifera have been mistaken by Ehrenberg for vascular canals, described by tha. observer as emanating from a dorsal vessel; such at least is the opinion of Dr. Arthur Farre in the memoir above referred to, an opinion which quite coincides with the result of our own observations upon this subject. employed, the apparently rotatory organs pro- pel the little animal rapidly through the water; but does it choose to take hold of some foreign body by means of its forceps, and thus anchor itself in a given spot, the use of the wheels is entirely changed, their rotation merely pro- ducing currents or rather a powerful whirlpool in the water, which sucks from a distance every thing within its influence, and thus brings food into the mouth. The next class of animals, the Epizoa, pre- sent us with a beautiful series of gradations of development, clearly demonstrating the insepara- ble relation that must exist between the nervous and locomotive systems. The Epizoa seem, indeed, to be the osculant group interposed between the Intestinal worms and the Articu- lated classes, and exhibit in a pertnanent con- dition the progressively improving external articulated limbs, which are only permitted to attain their full development in higher races of the animal creation. The Epizoa, like the Ccelelmintha, are parasitic in their habits, living, however, upon the external surface, and not in the interior of other animals. They are prin- cipally found fixed to the eyes, the skin, the gills, or even the inside of the mouth of fishes, or to the branchial organs of various forms of aquatic animals, from which they suck the materials necessary for their support, and at the same time are freely exposed to the influences of the surrounding medium for the purpose of respiration. In the humblest of these parasites the structure of the body is scarcely superior to that of many Ccelelmintha, suckers and pre- hensile organs placed in the vicinity of the mouth being their only means of adhering to the surface upon which they live; but in the Ler- vcam the first appearance of outward limbs begins to be perceptible, not as yet recognisable as legs or locomotive agents, but not the less on that account the first rude sproutings of members that are to be by degrees perfected in more highly privileged genera. Some of these Lerneans, indeed, present most grotesque shapes, and almost exactly resemble the em- bryos of Vertebrate animals at the period when the first buddings of limbs begin to project from the sides of the body. This resemblance, indeed, is far more real than it would at first appear, inasmuch as there is a parallelism to be established between the permanent condi- tion of the Lernean and the transitory state of the embryo at the corresponding period of its development that is strictly physiological. The condition of the nervous system in them both is precisely similar, exhibiting in both cases the nematoneurose type; the same rudimen- tary condition of the muscular system is con- sequently equally met with in the embryo and in the Lernean, but as the nervous system in the former is rapidly advancing to a more exalted state of development, so do the limbs and the muscles appertaining to them improve in the same ratio. In the higher genera of Epizoa minute ganglia exist in connexion with the nervous filaments, and in such the limbs are of course more exactly formed and begin to sketch out

ORGANIC ANALYSIS. 812 (/) An attempt was made to separate the colouring matter from the alcoholic extract by baryta water, and to obtain it free from baryta by solution in carbonate of ammonia, but it did not succeed; indeed I have never been able by this or any other process to separate the colouring matter from the other ingredients of the bile with sufficient accuracy to warrant its adoption for analytical purposes. (g) The quantity of alcoholic extract was in this case from the experiment with the baryta necessarily inferred from the deficiency. Since 1000 grs. contain 74.12 of solid mat- ters, 171.2 grs. will contain 12.69; we must, therefore, deduct the ethereal and watery ex- tract, and mucus:— (2.2 + 2.92 + 5.1) = 10.22 grs. 12.69 — 10.22 = 2.47. Biliary and co- louring matter:— 171.2 : 1000 : : 2.47 : x (= 14.37) biliary matter per 1000. The specimen of bile thus examined, there- fore, furnishes the following results :— Water 925.88 Mucus 29.78 Biliary and co- ) 14 ^ louring matter S Resinous and } n 04 fatty acids .. S Cholesterin 1.81 .Watery extract 17.05 Organic matter, 62.61. Fixed salts, 11.51. 999.93 M. Pettenkofer has recently proposed the change of colour produced by the action of sulphuric acid and sugar upon bile as a test of its presence. Having freed the liquid sus- pected to contain it from albumen by evapo- rating to dryness and exhausting the residue bv boiling water, the solution is concentrated by evaporation, and when cold mingled with about one-third of its bulk of oil of vitriol, so as to raise the temperature of the mixture from 150° to 160° of Fahrenheit, but not higher. A few grains of sugar are now added to the liquid, and the whole suffered to stand for a few minutes. If bile be present a beautiful crimson colour is developed, increasing in in- tensity for some minutes. The tint is un- equivocal provided the solution contain not less than Jm of its weight of dry bile, or ^ of the recent secretion. This reaction is independent of the mucus and colouring matter. 5. Of the saliva. The saliva is not often the object of analysis; when it is, it may be proceeded with as in the following instance, in which healthy saliva was examined. It was obtained several hours after taking food. It had a sp. gr. of 1001.5, was slightly alkaline, restoring the colour of reddened litmus paper ; and was ropy and opalescent. («) 111 grs. evaporated to dryness in a pla- tinum capsule and incinerated, left 0.22 grs. of ash. Ill : 1000 : : 0.22 : x (= 1.98) saline mat- ter per 1000. (6) 500 grs. evaporated by a water-bath left 2.51 grs. 500 : 1000 : : 2-51 : x(= 5.02) total solids. 5.02 ■— 1.98 = 3.04 organic matter. 1000 — 5.02 = 994.98 total quantity of loater. (c) The dry residue was digested in ether ; the ethereal solution decanted and evaporated left 0.03 grs. of an oily matter with a strong peculiar odour. It contained a trace of sulpho- cyanide of potassium, as was shewn by the red colour struck by a very dilute solution of ses- quicliloride of iron. 500 : 1000 : : 0.03 : x (= 0.06) fatty odorous matter with traces of sulpho- cyanide potassium. (d) The residue undissolved by ether was treated with boiling alcohol; the solution de- canted and evaporated left 0.61 of a crystalline yellowish deliquescent salt, in which the pre- sence of sulphocyanide of potassium was proved ; 1st, by its striking a blood-red liquid with a very dilute solution of sesquichloride of iron ; and 2ndly, this solution, according to Dr. Percy's suggestion, was acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and a fragment of zinc dropped in. Immediate effervescence ensued with a strong odour of sulphuretted hydrogen due to the decomposition of the sulphocyanide. Its acidulated aqueous solution gave no preci- pitate with nitrate of baryta ; but after a small portion of the alcoholic extract had been inci- nerated and the residue dissolved in water feebly acidulated with nitric acid, abundant precipitation was manifest on adding a solution of chloride of barium; during incineration the sulphocyanide had been decomposed and the sulphur, by absorbing oxygen, converted into sulphuric acid. 500 : 1000 : : 0.61 : x (— 1.22) alcoholic extract. (e) The residue left undissolved by alcohol was treated with water and thrown upon a weighed filter; the insoluble portion amounted to 0.68 : it consisted of mucus, debris of epi- thelium, &c. 500 : 1000 : : 0.68 : x {— 1.36) mucus. (_/') The filtered solution contained traces of albuminous matter (mucus) held in solution by the soda. This was precipitated by exact neu- tralization withaceticacid,evaporated todryness, redissolved, and again filtered. This aqueous liquid contained the ptyalin, or peculiar sali- vary matter, and a certain proportion of watery extract so called. Ptyalin has never yet been obtained in a state of purity. It always contains chlorides and phosphates mixed with it. The so- lution was mixed with twice its bulk of alcohol, by which the ptyalin in company with some watery extract was precipitated. Its solution, when redissolved in water, gave precipitates with acetate and triacetate of lead, infusion of galls, and nitrate of silver, but none with cor- rosive sublimate, sesquichloride of iron, or ferrocyanide of potassium, either alone or after the addition of acetic acid. Each time it is evaporated to dryness a small portion remains behind in an insoluble form. Deducting the ethereal and alcoholic extract, and mucus, 5.02 —(1.22 + 0.06+1.36 (e))= 2.38 re- presents the ptyalin and watery extract per 1000.

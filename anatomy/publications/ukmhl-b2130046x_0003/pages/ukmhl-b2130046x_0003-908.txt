(r) 15 grs. of the alkaline salts (n) were dis- solved in water and converted into chlorides by admixture with chloride of barium in ex- cess ; a precipitate of 6.4 grs. of sulphate and phosphate of baryta formed ; on treating this precipitate with nitric acid, 0.45 sulphate of baryta remained. 15 : 11.1 (n) : 0.45 : 0.333. 100 : 0.333 : : 34.19 : 0.114 sulphuric acid' in the ash, from 1000 parts of urine. But 1000 grs. of urine we found (by k) to contain 1.702 grs. sulphuric acid, therefore 1.702 — 0.114 = 1.588 grs. of sulphuric acid have been expelled by ignition. (s) The filtered solution was heated with caustic and carbonated ammonia to precipitate the excess of baryta as carbonate. The whole filtered, evaporated to dryness, and ignited to expel the ammoniacal salts. The fixed chlo- rides weighed 14 grs. They were dissolved in water, treated with bichloride of platinum, eva- porated nearly to dryness by a water-bath, then treated with alcohol, the platino-chloride of potassium amounted to 13.40 grs. 15 : 11.1 : : 13.40 : 9.916. 100 : 9.916 : 19.43 : : x (= 1.926) potash.

We find the equivalent quantity of sodium as follows:— 36 : 4.3317 : : 24 : x (— 2.8878) sodium, equivalent to the chlorine. The chloride of'sodium therefore amounts to 7.2195 grs.; deducting the sodium com- bined with chlorine from the entire quan- tity in the urine (t), we obtain 2.92356 — 2.8878 = 0.03576, or 0.0536 soda.

It was feebly acid, and had a specific gravity of 1038. Evaporated in vacuo over sulphuric acid, it furnished a pale amber-coloured soft mass, which weighed, On the third day 55.9 grs. sixth 54.1 ninth 53.4 fourteenth ... 53.1 thirtieth 52.2 The temperature varied between 60° and 70°, and the vacuum shewed from 1 inch to lg inches on the pressure gauge. The presence of even a very small portion of air materially retards the progress of the evaporation. From the weight on the thirtieth day we find 500 : 1000 : : 52.2 : x (= 104.4) solid contents, and 1000—104.4 = 895.6 water. As a contrast to this evaporation in vacuo, the remainder from 500 grs. was evaporated by water-bath, the temperature never rising above 180° F. In 24 hours the residue weighed 48.4 grs. 48 46.9 72 46.1 96 46.0 By this time it had assumed a deep brown colour, anrJ from being soft and sectile had, with the exception of a small portion in the centre, become hard and brittle; by exposure to the air it speedily deliquesced ; 30.6 grs. of the dry mass dissolved in water was mixed with 16.7 grs. of yeast, which from the eva- poration of another portion was found to con- tain 3.5 grs. of solid matter. The mixture was set aside for four days at a temperature of 70° to ferment; gas was slowly disengaged; when fresh bubbles ceased to form, the solu- tion was evaporated to dryness, and amounted to 25.8 grs.; deducting 3.5 solid matters of the yeast, we have an unfermentable mass of * The sulphuric acid has been deducted from the amount of organic matter determined by b and c, and added to that of the saline matters.

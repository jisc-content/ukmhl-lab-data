( 58 ) OF A MEDICINE CHEST. A Chest containing Instruments and Medicines for the treatment of diseases and injuries of the Elephant ought to accompany a Force with which that animal is employed. Of Instruments the following will be useful— 1st. A Veterinary Surgeon’s Pocket case of Instruments. 2d. Probes of steel of various length, from a foot to a foot and a half: and from a 20th to a 10th of an inch in diameter—these will be useful in probing abscesses, introducing pledgets, &c. 3d. Knives, for laying open abscesses. The Amputating Knives of a Surgeon’s case are of a convenient size for this purpose, but the handles are too weak in consequence of the steel part thereof not extending to the end— this defect may in part be,remedied by surrounding the handle throughout its extent with a piece of strong twine tightly rolled round it. 4th. Half a dozen of Knives of the medium size of those belonging to a Surgeon’s Amputating case, but with sharp points, for the inspection of carcases of animals which have died of disease. 5th. Needles for bringing together by means of thread, the lips of the wound made in bleeding. 6th. Bolus Knife. 7th. Spatula for spreading plaster. 8th. Pestle and Mortar, one of brass, large size, (6 lbs.) and one of Wedgwood’s Avare medium size, i. e. 4 lbs. 9th. Scales and Weights. 10th. Crucibles for fomentations, and also a supply for covering the body of the animal when under treatment for fever and other severe internal diseases, which require the surface to be kept warm. Uth. Thirty or forty yards of strong Bandage Cloth.

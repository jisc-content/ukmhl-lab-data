( 68 ) some data whence to form an opinion of the weight of the animal. There appears to me to be misapprehension entertained on the subject, in works on the Natural History of the Elephant published in Europe, in some of which the weight of the animal is certainly overrated. From 6 to 7 thousand pounds in these works is given as the average weight. In conducting the weighing of the carcase in portions as stated below, every regard was paid to ensure a correct result, and I consider the one given to be within a very few pounds of the exact weight of the living animal. 1840, August 20th and 21st, weighed carcase of a female Elephant in detached parts, which died of Zaarbahd, and found as follow :â€” cwt. qrs. lb.

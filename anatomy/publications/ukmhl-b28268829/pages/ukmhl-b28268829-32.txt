PART 2d. INSTRUCTIONS OF A PROPHYLACTIC KIND, OR REFERRING TO THE PRESERVING OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ANI- MAL WHILE IN HEALTH, AND REMARKS ON OTHER SUB- JECTS CONNECTED THEREWITH. In the former part of this Memoir we have seen that negligence may in several ways materially impair or wholly destroy the efficiency of the Elephant during the employment of the animal with a Force. This untoward event is most likely to occur from the following two causes, viz. injuries of the feet and abrasion of back from direct pressure of the load. 1st—INJURIES OF THE FEET. These are very liable to occur when the movement of a Force is over stony ground, or in woody situations through which roads have been opened up by the Pioneers, on which occasions the bushes are not always cut even with the ground, but stumps, an inch or two, are frequently left standing. The animal may unawares tread either on some of these stumps or on sharp pieces of stone, and in either case cripple itself more or less. It therefore will be a prudent measure to parties to go in advance of the Elephant, and to point out to the Mahout where such possible sources of injury are situated, and this is the more advisable as thereby all source of excuse for the animal being thus rendered inefficient is removed, and con- sequently a check instituted against malpractice on the part of the Mahouts in rendering their animals inefficient with the view to escape the fatigue of active service. When the route of a Force is over road such as above alluded to, recourse is sometimes had to the hardening the soles of the Elephant’s feet by the application of a composition as stated in Part 1st under the head Boornanee, page 22. The remarks there made, need not here be repeated, but are well

( 29 ) REFERRING TO THE SKETCH ABOVE. A represents the Numdha which for about feet of its lower edge on one side, should be, is furnished with holes (Q in number) in which are fixed iron rings, as at B. C is the belly-band attached permanently on one side to Numdha. At end above C, this belly-band should be furnished with an equal number of holes with iron rings as in the corresponding portion of the Numdha immediately above at B. By passing a rope alternately through the rings of the Numdha and belly-band, the latter can easily be drawn to the necessary degree of tightness. The belly-band ought to be 12 or 10 inches broad and to consist of three folds of gunny with a thin lining of Numdha or felt, on one side which is situated next to body. Then by means of other ropes passing through rings as d, d, d, the pads can be attached to the Numdha and thus secured on the animalâ€™s back. The animal is put to much inconvenience by the rope passing underneath the tail. This apparently could be conveniently superceded by a sort of breaching consisting of D going below the body, and E round the buttock a short way below the junction of tail with body. From the angle E, where these belts meet, rings may be placed to receive the rope from top of pad. Then as regards the neck, a broad band F might be placed on under part, to which the rope G, with the corresponding one in opposite side, could be attached. The above are the two most common causes of rendering the Elephant when on active service more or less inefficient. Nevertheless attention to the subjoined prophylactic remarks will be attended with benefit. PADS TO DEFEND THE HEAD WHEN PUSHING. Pads to defend the head when the animal is required to lend his aid in pushing, ought always to be applied. If he bruise or injure himself when so employed, and this he is liable to do if the pads be not used, he will most likely refuse again to give assistance in this way. H

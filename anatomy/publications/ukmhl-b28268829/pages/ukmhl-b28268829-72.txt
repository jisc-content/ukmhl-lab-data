( 66 ) silver tube of the instrument in question in the artery when some such mea- sures were adopted would defeat the object in view presuming the artery were pierced. In all attempts however complete failure resulted, arising, as the artery in so large a mass as is the neck, where no guide is afforded to the exact locality from pulsation of the vessel being felt or otherwise the only guide is the relative anatomical distribution of the parts, which is too indefinite to serve any practical purpose, in regard to the operation under consideration. The most common locality in which a serviceable vein will be found is the inner surface of either of the hinder legs; let a rope be tied around either hinder limb above the knee with some considerable degree of tightness, soon thereafter a swelling will arise on the inner side of the leg, abruptly prominent in regard to the contour of the limb ; by means of a strong scalpel make an inci- sion through the skin immediately over this swelling about an inch in length ; then the vessel dilated with blood will project in the opening; by means of a two edged scalpel, or an abscess lancet lay this open, when blood will flow freely, but seldom in a jet; it will trickle down the limb accordingly; the animal ought previously to the commencement of the operation to be made to stand on a large piece of leather which will receive the blood and prevent it flow- ing on the ground, whereby a more correct estimate can be made of the quan- tity drawn off. After the required quantity of blood has been drawn off the lips of the wound are to be brought together by a superficial stitch ; in order to prevent the animal kicking its legs ought to be tied together previously to the commencement of the operation. The locality just alluded to, will rarely fail to supply an eligible vein for the operation under description ; if so however, search must be made elsewhere. Occasionally a large vein will be found above the under part of the sides of the abdomen, frequently a large vein is to be seen on the inner sides of the fore legs, but the proximity of this locality to the trunk of the animal renders it unsafe to operate there, more particularly by a person to whom the animal is a stranger. MUSCULAR SYSTEM. The muscular system of the Elephant is peculiar on account of the great amount of tendinous fibre it contains ; about the shoulders and on the but- tocks, the usual fleshy red muscle is principally to be found, though even there it contains a considerable quantity of tendinous fibre but elsewhere on the sides of the abdomen, the legs, &c. tendinous fibre exists, in equal if not greater degree than the fleshy. The trunk is a singular compound of fleshy

PART 3d. THE MATERIA MEDICA, OR A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE VIRTUES AND DOSES OF THE MEDICINES, AND A STATEMENT OF SEVERAL CURATIVE MEASURES. In this part of the present Memoir, I propose giving a brief account of the different classes of medicines, and to name the most efficient belonging to each class, also to give a Catalogue of the substances prescribed by the Mahouts, and likewise to name several of their prescriptions for Mussallas or Medicinal preparations.

The classes of medicines about to be stated, are based on the known effects of the medicines included in each, and are arranged alphabetically. ALTERATIVES. This class of medicines is very useful in affections of the digestive organs of an obscure kind as to their nature, though very palpable as to their effects on the condition of the animal.

Where several threads over- lap each other gran- ules may be seen pass- ing from one into the other. At such places broad flat surfaces may be produced by the heaping up of the thread substance. A special kind of protoplasmic move- ment is described by Engelmann (III. 5, 7) under the name of gliding movement (Grlitschbewegung). It has been observed chiefly in Diatoms and Oscillaria. In the former the proto- plasm is surrounded by a siliceous shell, in the latter by a cellu- lose membrane. How- ever, outside this covering there is an exceedingly delicate layer of hyaloplasm, quite free from gran- ules, which cannot be seen in the living ob-

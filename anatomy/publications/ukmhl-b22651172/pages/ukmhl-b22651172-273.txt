253 THE VTTAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL. by a number of experiments upon Leucophrys patula, a species of Irifusorian, that only after 300 generations have been produced from a fertilised individual does the generation cycle close, the descendants now showing for the first time the inclination and capacity for sexual conjugation. In Onychodromus grandis this Fig. 137.â€”Development of Pandorina movuin (after Pringsheim ; from Sachs, Fig. 411): J a swarming colony ; II the same, split up into sixteen daughter-colonies; III a sexual family, through the gelatinous envelope of which the individual cells are passing out; IV, V conjugation of the swarm-spores; VI a newly-formed zygote; VII a full- grown zygote; VIII transformation of the contents of a zygote into a large swarm- cell; IX the same, after having been set free; X the young colony derived from ihe swarm-cell. .. condition occurs after the 140th generation, and in Stylonichia pustulafa, after the 130th generation. Jn multicellular organisms the cells, which are produced by the

CHEMICO-PHYSIOAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5> ITS corpuscle, two were present, lying close together, either in the im- mediate neighbourhood of the resting nucleus, or in an indenta- tion of it, directly in contact with the nuclear membrane. As a rule no radiation sphere was to be seen in these cases ; some- times the two central corpuscles, instead of touching each other closely, were somewhat separated from one another, and under these cii-cumstances the first com- mencement of a spindle formation between them was visible. A Pig. 35.—Pigment cell of the Pike, with two nuclei, and one pole corpuscle, sur- rounded by a radiation sphere. (After Solgjr, Fig. 2.) B Fig. 36.—A Nucleus of an endothelial cell from the peritoneum of a Salamander larva, with the pole corpuscle lying near (after Flemming, Fig. 2). B Nucleus of a con- nective tissue cell from the peritoneum of a Salamander larva, with the pole corpuscle lying near (after Flemming, Fig. i). Van Beneden (II. 52) first advanced the theory that the central corpuscle, like the nucleus, is a constant organ of each cell, and that it must be present in the cell in some portion of the protoplasm near the nucleus. The property possessed by the central corpuscle of being able to multiply itself by spontaneous division (vide Chap. VI.) seems to be in support of the first part of this view, :is is also the role it plays in the process of fertilisation (vide Chap. VII. 1) ; but the second portion of this theory, although it is very generally accepted, that the central corpuscle belongs to tho protoplasm, appears to me, on the contrary, less certainly true.

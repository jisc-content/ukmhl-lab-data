THE CELT/ ])lace in a lymph cell during the course of three hours, the pre- paration being kept at a temperature varying from 16° to 18°. Arnold (VI. 1) and others have verified his statements, and have amplified them in various ways. The vesicular nucleus can change its form actively, and can cover itself with excrescences and pro- tuberances. Under such circumstances constrictions frequently occur, after which the nuclei break up into two, three, or more pieces (Fig. 100 A, B). The nuclear fragments move apart from one another, not infrequently remaining joined together for a considerable time by delicate connecting threads. Cell division often closely follows nuclear division, as is seen in Figs. 100 A, B. >: -' ' % - -^1 I h - ■■ V Fig. 100.—A A migratory cpII from a disc of elder pith which has lain for ten days in the lymph sac of a Frog. When Brat observed the nucleus was somewhat constricted in its middle, whilst its ends were bilooed. After five minutes the nuclear division was com- pleted (after Arnold, PI. XII., Pig. 1). B Migratory cell during division. Pig. A de- veloped into Pig. B during the course of thirty minutes (after Arnold, PI. XII., Pig. 3). The protoplasmic body also becomes constricted between the nuclear fragments, which move apart, but are still joined by a fine thread. The two nuclear fragments move in opposite direc- tions by means of a large number of amoeboid processes. In consequence, the connecting bridge between them is sometimes drawn out to a long fine thread, after the daughter-nuclei have separated from one another. " No law can be laid down as to the time when the various stages of division follow one another during fragmentation ; very frequently nuclei and cells linger in one or other stage " (Arnold).

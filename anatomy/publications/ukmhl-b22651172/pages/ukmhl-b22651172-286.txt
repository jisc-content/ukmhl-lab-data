266 THE CELL in one very interesting peculiarity, namely, that their nuclear apparatus has split up into two kinds of nuclei, which differ physiologicHlly, i.e. into the chief nucleus (macro-nucleus) (Fig. 146 k), and into one or more sub-nuclei or sexual nuclei (n, k) (micro-nuclei). If plenty of nourishment be present, the Infu- soria, which may be cultivated for observation in a small drop of water, multiply by means of the usual transverse division (Fig. Fig. 117.

This asexual multiplication is so energetic under favourable conditions that a single individual may, during the period of six days, divide thirteen times, and thus produce about 7,000 or 8,000 descendants. However, it has been shown, especially by the culture experi- ments of Maupas and Richard Hertwig, that an Infusorian is un- able to maintain the species for any length of time, and to continue to multiply by simple division, even if nourishment be supplied to it. The individuals undergo changes with regard to the nuclear apparatus ; they may even completely lose it, when they no longer

328 THE CEM, period, protrude a stalk-like (peduncular) process right up to the surface of the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 165). This process has a regular fibrillary (rodded) structure, as.is always seen, when an active exchange of material takes place in definite directions; it may, therefore, be considered to be a special nutrient apparatus of the ovum. In this case, too, the germinal vesicle is always situated in immediate contact with the base of the nutrient ap- paratus. Pig. 16 ». Fig. 165, Fig. 161.—Immature ovum of Actinia parasitica, (x 145: after Korschelt, p. 47, Fig. 8 ) Fig. 165.—Transverse section through the peripheral end and through the stalk of egg- cells oE Sagartia ■parasitica (after O. and R. Hertwig); from Korschelt, Fig. 10. The striated stalk of the egg-cell has penetrated into the epithelium at the top of the figure. A similar condition is found in the tubular ovaries of Insects, which are divided into germ compartments and yolk compart- ments. In this case the germinal vesicle is either again placed close to the yolk compartment, or, which is more interesting, it extends towards this compartment numerous pseudopodic pro- cessess, by which means it considerably increases its superficial area in that region, where the absorption of material is taking place. Here, too, the yolk in the neighbourhood of the germinal vesicle begins to separate off uumerous dark granules, which have been derived from the nutritive cells. In most animals the ova are nourished by means of the follicular cells. Thus Korschelt has found that, as long as the formation of the yolk and chorion is proceeding, the nuclei of the follicular cells in Insects are situated in immediate contact with that surface

264 THE CELI it presses between the two synergida? right into the egg-cell. The pollen grain and the pollen tube contain two nuclei, the vegetative one, which takes no part in fertilisation, and the sperm- nucleus. This latter comes to lie at the end of the pollen tube, after this has made its way to the egg-cell; thence it passes through the weakened cellulose wall into the protoplasm of the egg, whilst two centrosomes advance in front of it; these latter were discovered by the French investigator, Gnignard (Fig. 143). It soon meets the egg-nucleus, which is somewhat larger, and on whose surface also a pair of centrosomes may be distinguished.

The fusing of the centrosomes is nearly completed. The two nuclei (Fig. 144) then coalesce, as do also the four centrosomes ; these latter unite so as to form two new pairs, of which each is composed of one element of male and one of female origin. The new pairs are situated on op- posite sides of the cleavage nucleus, and there develop into the two centrosomes of the first nuclear spindle (Fig. 145). In the same way as in animal sexual cells, the nuclein and the number of nuclear seg- ments derived from it are decreased during the formation of the pollen-cell and of the egg-cell to one half of the quantity present in a normal nucleus. For instance, whilst in Lilium martagon the normal nucleus de- velops during its division 24 nuclear seg- ments which split • up into 48 daughter- Fig. 1-16. — Egg - cell from the embryo-sac of /,ilium martagon, with its nucleus undergoing divi- sion.

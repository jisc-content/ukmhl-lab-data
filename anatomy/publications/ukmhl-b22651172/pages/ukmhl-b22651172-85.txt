jg ru^f t*cwi a^<- CHAPTER III. THE VITAL PEOPEETIES OF THE CELL. I. The Phenomena of Movement. All the mysteries of life, which are exhibited by plants and animals, are present, as it were in a rudimentary form, in the simple cell. * Each individual cell, like the whole complex organism, has an indjependent life of its own. If we wish to study more deeply the true nature of protoplasm, we must above all things investigate its most important properties, its so-called vital properties. However, life, even the life of the simplest elementary organism, is a most complex phenomenon, which it is most difficult to define ; it manifests itself, to use a wide generalisation, in this, that the cell in conse- quence of its own organisation, and under the influence of its environment, experiences continual changes and develops powers, by means of which its organic substance is being continually broken down and built up again. During the former process, energy is set free. The whole vital process, as Claude Bernard (IV. 1a) expresses it, depends upon the continual co-relation of this organic destruction and restoration. // It is most convenient to classify these most complex phenomena under four heads. Thus each living organism exhibits four different fundamental functions or properties, by means of which its life is made manifest : it can alter its form, and exhibit move- ments ; it reacts to certain external stimuli in various ways, that is to say, it is irritable ; it has the power of nourishing itself, it can by absorbing and transforming food material, and by giving up waste products, form substances/which it utilises for growth, for building up tissues, and for special vital functions ; finally, it can reproduce itself. Hence we will discuss the vital properties of the cell in four chapters, which we will take in the following order : 1. Phenomena of movement. . 2. Phenomena of ippitabilffcy. ^ocA^b^U^tu^ . *V Coc**Jtky 3. Metabolism and formative activity. 4. Reproduction. 05 1 Vv4 Lww- ' ^X<J\->~ir^*J~ ' Cor ' U^ttm*

A nucleolus is always present in the meshes of the framework. III. Are there Elementary Organisms existing without Nuclei ? The important question, as to whether the nucleus is an indispensable portion of every cell, follows naturally on the description of the chemical and morphological properties of the nucleus. Are there elementary organisms without nuclei ? Formerly investigators were not at a loss to answer this question. For since, in consequence of the inadequacy of former methods of examination, no nuclei had been discovered in many of the lower organisms, the^existence of two different kinds of elementary cells was assumed : more simple ones, consisting only of a mass of protoplasm, and more complex ones, which had developed in y their interior a special organ, the nucleus. The former were called cytodes by Haeckel (I. 10; II. 15), to the simplest, solitary forms of which he gave the name of Monera; the latter he called cellulae, or cytes. But since then the aspect of the question has become considerably changed. Thanks to the improvements in optical instruments, and in staining methods, the existence of organisms without nuclei is now much questioned. In many of the lower plants, such as Algsre and Fungi, and in Protozoa, Vampyrella, Polythalamia, and Myxomycetes, all quoted formerly as examples of non-nucleated cells, nuclei may now be demonstrated without much trouble. Further, since the nucleus has been discovered in the mature ovum (Hertwig II. 19 a), we may safely say that, in the whole animal kingdom, there is not a single instance where the existence of a cell with- out a nucleus has been proved. I shall probably be confronted with the red corpuscles of Mammals. It is true thai they contain no nuclei, but then neither do they contain any true proto-

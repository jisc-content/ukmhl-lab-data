67 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL flow back again, thus causing them to decrease in size, until finally they are com- pletely withdrawn, whilst new processes are being protruded from another portion of the body. By means of these alternate protrusions and retractions of their pseudo- podia, the small bodies of protoplasm are enabled to move from place to place, crawl- ing over the objects to whose surfaces they cling at a rate which can only be measured under the microscope. Amcebce are able to traverse a distance of \ mm. in a minute. In this manner the white blood cor- puscles during inflammation are able to pass through the walls of the capillaries and of the smaller vessels, and the lympb corpuscles make their way as wandering cells into the connective tissue spaces, such as the interlamellar spaces of the cornea, where the resistance to be overcome is not great, or they force their Fro. 37.—A Leucocyte of the Frog containing a Bac- terium which is undergoing the process of digestion.

This extension and retraction of pseudopodia is most marked in a small Amoeba (Fig. 38), which was described as far back as 1755 by Roesel von Rosenhof, who on account of its energetic changes of form called it tbe small Pro- teus. Somewhat different movements take place in Myxomycetes, and in Thalamophora, Heliozoa, and Radiolaria. The plasmodia of some species of Myxomycetes, suck as the JEthalium septicum, often spread

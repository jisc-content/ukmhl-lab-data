THE CELL 230 band connecting them with the main part of the nucleus generally becomes as fine as a hair. Small protuberances develop on the free surface whenever the knob-like nuclear ends touch it. Thus, as these ends grow, each is contained by a special protuberance or cell-bud of its own. The whole cell-bud then increases some- what in size, and becomes constricted at its base from the mother-cell; the part of the nucleus, which it contains, takes the form of a horse-shoe, separating itself from the delicate connecting thread which united it to the mother-nucleus. The cell-buds are now mature, and after detaching themselves from the mother organism, move about for a time in the sea-water as zoospores. II. Partial or Meroblastic Segmentation. If we disregard the case of certain Protozoa (Noctiluca), partial segmentation occurs only in egg-cells. It may conveniently be con- sidered after unequal division. . It is found in all cases where the amount of yolk present is extremely great, and where the proto- plasm is clearly separated from it, being collected together in a disc at the animal pole (Fig. 108). The nucleus, which is situated in the centre of this disc, must assume a horizontal position when it de- velops into a spindle. Hence the first division plane is in a ver- tical direction, and appears first at the animal pole in the centre of the disc (Figs. 120 A, 121 A), as in an egg, in which unequal cleav- J B C Pig. 120.â€”Surface view of the first cleavage stiige of a Hen's egg (after Coste): a edge of germinal disc; b vertical furrow; c small central portion; d large peripheral portion. age occurs (Fig. 92). Whilst, however, it gradually deepens and sinks in until it has cut its way through to the vegetative pole, the germinal disc is divided into two equal segments, which rest like two buds, with their broad bases upon the undivided yolk-mass,

THE CELL CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION Both plants and animals, although they differ so widely in their external appearance, are fundamentally similar in their anatomical structure; for both are built up of similar elementary units, which, as a rule, are only to be seen with the microscope. These ! units, in consequence of a hypothesis which was once believed in, but is now discarded, are called cells ; and the view that plants and animals are built up in a similar manner of these extremely minute particles is called the cell-theory. The cell-theory is rightly considered to be one of the most important and funda- mental theories of the whole science of modern biology. In the study of the cell, the botanist, the zoologist, the physiologist, and the pathologist go hand in hand, if they wish to search into the vital phenomena which, take place during health and disease. For it is in the cells, to which the anatomist reduces both plant and animal organisms, that the vital functions are executed; they, as Virchow has expressed it, are the vital elementally units. Regarded from this point of view, all the vital processes of a complex organism appear to be nothing but the highly-developed result of the individual vital processes of its innumerable variously functioning cells. The study of the processes of digestion, of the changes in muscle and nerve cells, leads finally to the examination of the functions of gland, muscle, ganglion, and brain. And just ' as physiology has been found to be based upon the cell-theory, so has the study of disease been transformed into a cellular pathology. Hence, in many respects, the cell-theory is the centre around which | X the biological research of the present time revolves. Further, it forms the basis of the study of minute anatomy, now more commonly called histology, which consists in the exami- nation of the composition and minute structure of the organism.

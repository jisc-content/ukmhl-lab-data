252 CHAPTER VII. THE VITAL PEOPERTIES OF THE CELL. V. Phenomena and Methods of Fertilisation. Cell reproduction by means of cell division, such as is described in Chapter VI., does not, at least for the majority of organisms, ap- pear to be able to continue for an indefinite period ; the process of multiplication, after a shorter or longer period, comes to a stand- still, unless it is stimulated afresh by the excitatory processes, which are grouped together under the name of fertilisation. Only the very lowest organisms, such as fission fungi, appear to be able to multiply indefinitely by repeated divisions; for the greater part of the animal and vegetable kingdoms the general law may be laid down, that after a period of increase of mass through cell division a time arrives when two cells of different origin must fuse together, producing by their coalescence an elementary organism which affords the starting-point for a new series of N â€¢ multiplications by division. Hence the multiplication of the elementary organism, and with it life itself, resolves itself into a cyclic process. After generations of cells have been produced by division, the life-cycle returns to the same starting-point, when two cells must unite in the act of fertilisation, and thus constitute themselves the foundation of a new series of generations. Such cycles are termed- generation cycles. They occur in the whole organic kingdom in the most various forms. In unicellular organisms, for instance, the generation cycle consists of a large number of independent individuals, which sometimes amount to thousands. The fertilised elementary organism multiplies by repeated divisions, producing descendants, which do not require fertilisation, until a period arrives when a new generative act occurs between the generations which have been produced asexually. These phenomena have been most carefully observed in Infusoria. Thus Maupas (VII. 30, p. 407) has proved

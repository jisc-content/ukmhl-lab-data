M E'PaBOLIC changes 325 no definite position. In other cases, however, its position is fixed." I will cite a few especially instructive examples from the numerous observations, on which Haberlandt has based his laws. The epidermal cells of many plants often exhibit thickenings on the surface of their walls; this may occur either on those pointing outwards or on those pointing inwards. The nucleus here lies near to the one in which the thickening occurs, being always close to the middle of the latter. The examples given in Fig. 161 show this very distinctly: No. I., a row of cells from the epidermis of a foliage-leaf of Cypripedinm insigne; No. III. an epidermal cell of the fruit-scale of Carex A B panicea, and No. IV. a young epidermal cell of a foliage-leaf of Aloe verrucosa. A second series of investigations have been made upon the development of plant- hairs, growing both above and below ground. I III IV Fio. 101. 102. 11.1.. Fig. 1).

A 01'' THE CELL 233 THE VITAL PHENOME follow. These daughter-nuclei (Fig. 122 A) then divide into four, these four into eight, the eight into sixteen, and so on, whilst the ■egg as a whole remains unseg- mented. Later on the nuclei sepa- rate from one another, and for the most part move gradually to the surface (Fig. 122 B), penetrating into the protoplasmic envelope, where they arrange themselves at •equal distances from one another. Not until this has occurred does the egg commence to segment, the peripheral layer splitting up into as many cells as there are nuclei in it, whilst the central yolk remains intact, or is only split np at a much later period. This latter occurs when in the eggs of insects, as in telolecithal eggs, the yolk contains yolk nuclei, or merocytes (Fig. 122 G). The wall of the embryo-sac in Phanerogamia is coated with a protoplasmic lining, which at a certain stage of development con- tains several hundred regularly arranged nuclei; these were for- merly considered to develop like crystals in a mother-liquor; but we know now, that they are pro- duced by the repeated bipartition of a mother nucleus, as in the eggs of Arthropoda (Fig. 123). The divi- sions occur almost simultaneously in any one region of the embryo- sac. If the preparation is suc- cessful, nuclei in numerous stages of division may be observed at one time in a small space (Fig. 123).

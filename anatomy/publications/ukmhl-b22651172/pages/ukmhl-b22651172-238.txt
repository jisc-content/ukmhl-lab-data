218 THE CELL surface in any of the diameters, but in an oval disc it is parallel only to the longest diameter. The phenomena observed during cell division, and especially during the formation of the furrows, are almost without exception in accordance with these laws. Two facts, however, are especially confirmatory of the truth of the second law ; one was discovered by Auerbach, through his experiments on the eggs of Ascaris nigrovenosa and Strongylus auricularis (VI. 2), and the other by Pfluger. The eggs of both the Nematodes investigated by Auerbach are oval in shape (Fig. 110), so that two poles can be distinguished in A B c D Fig. 110.â€”Eggs of ^scan's nigrovenosa, in four different stages of fertilisation. (After Auerbach, PI. IV., Pigs. 8-11.) them, and these two poles play different roles during fertilisation. At the one at which the germinal substance of the egg is situated, the pole cells are formed, and the female pro-nucleus develops, whilst at the other pole, which faces the mouth of the uterus, the spermatozoon enters, and fructification occurs ; further, the male pro-nucleus makes its appearance here (vide Chap. VII.). Whilst gradually increasing in size, both pro-nuclei approach each other, travelling in a straight line, which coincides with the axis of the egg; finally, after having grown into two vesicles of considerable size, they meet in the centre of the axis ; they then come into such close contact that their contingent surfaces become flattened (Fig. 110 A). As a rule, during the conjugation of the sexual nuclei, the axis of the spindle, which develops out of them, and at the ends of which the centrosomes are situated, lies somewhere in the

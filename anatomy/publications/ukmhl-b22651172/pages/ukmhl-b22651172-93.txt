TfTE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL 73 circulate quite close together, sometimes in the same, sometimes in opposite directions. * The nucleus, as well as the chlorophyll and starch grains, which lie embedded in the protoplasm, are car- ried slowly along by the current. Similarly in this case the most external hy- aline layer of protoplasm, which is in contact with the cellulose membrane, is, comparatively speaking, at rest. In the second place, the whole body of proto- plasm itself slowly moves along, in consequence of which it changes its form. Broad bands become nar- rowed, and may after a time disappear, delicate threads increase in size, and new processes are formed, just as new pseudopodia are protruded to the ex- terior by Myxomycetes and Rhizopoda. Large masses of protoplasm become heaped up here and there upon the layer lining the cell-wall, whilst at other places the coating becomes thinner. c. Theories concerning Protoplasmic Movements. Attempts have lately been made by various investigators, Quincke (III. 17), Biitschli (II. 7c), Berthold (III. 2), and others, to com- pare these protoplasmic movements with those exhibited by a mixture of inorganic substances, and thus to explain them. Quincke has carefully investigated the movements which occur at the areas of contact of various fluids. He placed in a glass containing water a drop of a mixture of almond oil and chloroform, Fig. 41.â€”A B, cells of a staminal hair of Tra- desctmtia virginica.

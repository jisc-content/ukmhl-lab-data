232 THE CULL III. So-called Free Cell-Formation. The peculiarity of this form of multiplication consists in this, that the nucleus in a cell subdivides several times consecutively, whilst the protoplasmic body remains undivided for a considerable time without showing the least inclination towards even a partial cleavage. After bipartition has been l-epeated several times, the number of nuclei in a single protoplasmic body may amount to several hundreds. These arrange themselves at regular distances from one another. Finally a period arrives when the many-nucle- ated mother-cell becomes either suddenly or gradually split up into as many daughter-cells as there are nuclei in it. Free cell-formation occurs chiefly, in both plants and animals, during the development of the sexual products. In order to demonstrate it, I will select three examples: the superficial segmentation of the centrolecithal eggs of Arthropoda, the for- mation of the endosperm in the embryo-sac within the ovule of Phanerogamia, and the formation of spores in the sporangia of Saprolegnia. The yolk mass is generally collected in the centre of the egg in Arthropoda, being surrounded, by a thin pei-ipheral layer of protoplasm. Hence the eggs are called centrolecithal, i.e. eggs with yolk in the centre, in distinction to telolecithal eggs, in which the yolk is situated at the poles (Balfour VI. 3). The cleavage nucleus, surrounded by a protoplasmic envelope, is generally in the centre of the nutritive yolk ; here it divides into two daughter- nuclei, whilst the division of the egg itself does not immediately Fig. 122â€”Superficial cleavage of the egg of an insect (Pieris crafcugt) (afier Bobretsky ; from R.

THE VITAL PHENOMENA OP THE CELL 197 centrosomes with their radiation spheres situated at either the spindle. Fig. 93.â€”Fritillaria imperial!*. A resting nucleus and other nuclei at various stages of division, taken from the tree protoplasmic lining of the wall of the ernbryo-sac depicted in Fig. 128 (after Strasburger, Practical Botany, Fig. 191). A A resting nucleus; B a coil of thick threads, as yet unsegmented; C a portion of a nuclear thread, more highly magni- fied ; D a nuclear spindle, with segments longitudinally split; E the separation and change of position of the daughter-segments. A, B, D, E x 800 ; C x 1100. When the process of division has reached its highest point, the nuclear segments split longitudinally. The daughter segments then travel towards the two poles, twenty-four on each side (E), and thus form the foundation for the daughter nuclei, which develop in a manner similar to that described as occurring in Salamandra maculata. As soon as the daughter nuclei become vesicular, several nucleoli appear in them. Up to this point the resemblance shown by the process to that seen in animal nuclear division has been complete; however, now, at the end of the whole process, a peculiar and interesting devia-

ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 35 are more frequently found; these either distend the cell or render it somewhat solid. When there has been a considerable develop- ment of such substances, the protoplasm may again assume a frothy appearance, as in Actinosphcerium (Fig. 15), or it may become transformed into a network structure, as in a Tradescantia cell (Fig. 13), the only difference being that the interstices are filled with substances denser than sap. Na cv Fig. 15.â€”Actinosphcerium Eic/ilionit (after R. Hertwig, Zoologie, Fig. 117) .- M medullary substance, with nuclei (n) ; B peripheral substance, with contractile vacuoles (cu); Na nutrient substances. The most perfect examples are often seen in animal egg-cells The exceedingly large size, which is attained by many of these, is not so much caused by an increase of protoplasm, as by the storing up of reserve materials, which vary very much as to their chemical composition, being sometimes formed and sometimes unformed substances, and which are intended for future use in the economy of the cell. Very often the egg-cell appears to be almost entirely composed of such substances. The protoplasm only fills up the small spaces between them, like the mortar between the stones of

287 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL in the oogonium. The male cells, on the contrary (Fig. 156 F), are even smaller and more motile than those already described, and have assumed the characteristic properties of antherozoids; a F Vi Fig. 150—Spermatozoids or Fucus (x 540). Egg, with adhering spermatozoids. (After Straaburger, Fig. 87 G and F.) they are composed almost entirely of nuclear substance, and are provided with two flagella, which function as organs of: locomo- tion. The view that eggs and spermatozoids of the higher Algse are derived genetically from swarm-cells, which differentiate them- selves sexually in opposite directions, and gradually assume a specific male and female form, is still more strongly supported by the phenomena observed in the little family of Volvocinese than by comparing various species of Algae. This family is especially interesting and important in the consideration of the problem in question, since some of the various species, which in their whole appearance are extremely similar (Pandorina morum, Eudorina elegans, Volvox globator), exhibit marked differences in their sexual cells, whilst others show no difference at all, and in yet others an intermediate stage can be observed. The whole relationship is so clearly demonstrated that it is worth while to consider it more in detail. Pandorina morum, which is especially well known—for as early as 1869 Pringsheim (VII. 35) discovered the pairing of its swarm-spores—forms small colonies of about sixteen cells, which are enclosed in a common gelatinous sheath (Fig. 157 II). Each cell bears two flagella on its anterior end ; these stretch out beyond the surface of the gelatinous sheath, and are used for locomotion. During sexual reproduction each of the sixteen cells splits up generally into eight portions, which after a time are set free, and

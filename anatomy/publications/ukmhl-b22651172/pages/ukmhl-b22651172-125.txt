105 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OP THE CELL investigation of Stahl (IV. 34), which he conducted on the lines laid down by Famintzin, Frank, and Borodin. When the illumina- tion is faint, or when the leaves are in shadow, the protoplasm moves so that the chlorophyll granules are arranged upon those external surfaces of the cells which are turned towards the light (Fig. 52.4), having completely forsaken the side-walls. On the other hand, the protoplasm, under the influence of direct sunlight, streams away towards the side-walls, until the external surface is quite free from chlorophyll gi-anules, that is to say, in the first Via. 52.—Transverse section through the leaf of Lemma tritulca (after Stahl) • A surface position (position assumed in diffused sunlight), B arrangement of chlorophyll granules under the influence of intense light; C position assumed by chlorophyll granules in the case, the whole chlorophyll-bearing substance, as in Mesocarpus, assumes a surface position towards the impinging light, and in , he second, a profile position; hence the varying colour of the leaves

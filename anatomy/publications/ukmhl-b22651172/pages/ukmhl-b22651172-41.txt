ITS CHKMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 21 the cells of a honeycomb, being in the form of very varying poly- hedra ; they are separated from one another by the most delicate lamellae of oil, which refract the light somewhat more strongly than the watery liquid does. As a result of physical laws, only three lamellae can touch at one edge. Hence it appears in optical UJdlLLUiiij, iiMiMSHf^J.itrrlF—alv section, that only three lines meet in ^^^K^w^vHiSOXv any one point.

III., Fig. 4.) the point ot intersection. M inally, the superficial layer is composed of a delicate froth, the frame- work of which is arranged in a peculiar fashion, the partition walls of oil/which touch the surface/ being perpendicular to it, and thus appearing parallel to one another in optical section. Biitschli describes this as the alveolar layer (Fig. 3 alv.). Biitschli considers that the protoplasm of all plant and animal cells (Figs. 4, 5) possesses a structure which is similar to this.

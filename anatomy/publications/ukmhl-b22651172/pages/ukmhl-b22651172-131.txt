111 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL Fig. 57.â€”Orfotolites. A portion of the surface with its psendopodia: 4 undisturbed; B the whole has been stimulated by repeated shaking.

This is of importance to Rhizopoda in absorbing food. gradually shortens itself, a motion in which the neighbouring threads eventually participate, the Infusorian is gradually drawn into the centre of the protoplasmic mass, where it undergoes digestion. V. Chemical Stimuli. A living cell is able to a certain extent to adapt itself to chemical changes in its environment. For this, however, one thing is most important, namely that the changes should be made gradually, not suddenly. JEthalium plasmodia flourish in a 2 per cent, solution of grape- sugar, if the latter is added in gradually increasing quantities to the water (IV. 35). If they were to be transferred straight from pure water into this chemically different environment, the sudden change would result in their death; this would also occur if they were to be suddenly placed back into pure water from the 2 per cent, sugar solution. It is evident that the protoplasm needs time to adapt itself to its altered condition, probably by increasing or diminishing the amount of water it contains. Marine Amoebae and Reticulata remain alive after the water which contains them, in consequence of being in an open vessel, has evaporated so much that it contains 10 per cent, of salt. Fresh water Amcebas can gradually accustom themselves to a 4 per cent, solution of common salt, whereas, if they are suddenly immersed in a 1 per cent, solution, they contract into balls, and in time become broken up into glistening' droplets. During the pro- cess of adaptation to a new chemical environment, the individual

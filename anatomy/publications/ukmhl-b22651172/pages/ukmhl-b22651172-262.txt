242 THE CELL At the same time, the furrows already mentioned deepen, so that each spindle comes to lie in a protuberance or bud. Now tlie splitting up becomes either pretty well completed, or the four spindles, before the furrows have penetrated far into the yolk, commence to divide, the nuclear segments travelling towards the poles. The result of this is that the four first protuberances begin to become constricted a second time and to separate from one another (cell-budding, bud formation). The most striking of the phenomena described above is the sudden appearance of the four pole radiations, for which, accord- ing to our present knowledge, an equal number of centrosomes must have served as bases. An explanation of this is afforded us by the processes connected with the fertilisation of the Echinoderm egg, which are discussed on p. 259. Modifications of the form of nuclear transformation, shown in Fig. 129 0, occur not infrequently; these are due to one of the radiations being somewhat separated from the three others (Fig. 130). In this case the three that are situated close to one another Fig. 130. Fig. 131. Figs. 130, 131.â€”Nuclenr figures with four poles from Slrongylocentrotus eggs, which, one and a half hours after the act of fertilisation, have been placed for twenty minutes in -05 per cent, solution of quinine, and which have been killed two hours after their removal from the quinine solution. are united by the three spindles to form a triaster. In the centre of the equilateral triangle thus formed, the three nuclear planes intersect, producing another regular figure. The fourth radiation, which is situated at one side, is connected by a single spindle with the radiation nearest to it. Fig. 131 may be regarded as an intermediate stage between Figs. 129 and 130. Here the radiation x, which lies somewhat

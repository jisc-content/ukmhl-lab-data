THE VIT'AI, PROPERTIES OF THE CELL 289 When two swarm-spores meet, they first touch each other with their points (IV), and then fuse together to form a biscuit-shaped body, which gradually draws itself up into a ball (VI, VII, X). This surrounds itself, a few minutes after fertilisation, with a cellulose cell-wall, and then, as a zygote, enters into a resting condition, during which its original green colour becomes brick- red. A sexual difference is seen in Eudorina eleqans, a species which is very similar in other respects to Pandorina, being also a gelatinous sphere containing from sixteen to thirty-two cells (Fig. 158). At the time of fertilisation the colonies become differentiated into male and female.

' ' In the female colonies the individual cells transform themselves without further division into globular eggs; in the male colonies, on the contrary, each cell splits up by means of repeated divisions u

THE VITAL PHENOMENA OK THE CELL 227 the axes of the nuclear spindles arrange themselves so as to be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the quadrants. The same thing occurs here in a somewhat modified form (Fig. 115 B). On account of the greater amount of protoplasm present in the upper half of each quadrant, the spindle is unable to lie in the centre, as in an egg in which equal cleavage occurs, but must approach nearer to the animal pole of the egg. Further, it is exactly per- pendicular, for, on account of the unequal weight of their halves, the quadrants of the amphibian egg are firmly fixed in the egg space. In consequence, the third division plane must now be horizontal (Fig. 1164), and further, it must be placed above the A B C D Fib. 116.—Stages in the cleavage of Petromyzon. (From Hatschek, Fig. 72 ; A, B after Shipley; C, D, after M. Schultze.) equator of the sphere of the egg, being situated more or less towards the animal pole. The portions thus produced are very dissimilar both in size and constitution, and this is why this form of cleavage has been called unequal. The four upper portions are smaller, and poorer in yolk ; the four lower much larger, and richer in yolk. They are called animal and vegetative cells according to whether they are directed towards the animal or vegetative pole. As development proceeds (Fig. 116 B, G,D), the difference between the animal and the vegetative cells grows greater and greater, for the more protoplasm a cell contains, the more quickly and frequently does it divide, as has been already mentioned above. Unequal cleavage can also occur in oval eggs. For instance, the egg of Fabricia (Fig. 117), as has been already mentioned (Fig. 109), in consequence of the collection FlG- ^--^s of Fab- £ n _ . ricia divided into two or yolk around one pole, divides into one cells.

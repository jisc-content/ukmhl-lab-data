166 THE CELL ternal wall of the capsule, with its opening, becomes differentiated, and around it the contractile sheath develops. b. External Plasmic Products. The external plasmic pro- ducts may be divided into three groups,—cell membranes, cuticular formations, and intercellular substances. Cell membranes are structures which separate out, and envelop the whole surface of the cell-body. In the vegetable kingdom they are very important, and easily seen, whilst in the animal kingdom they are frequently absent, or are so slightly developed that they can hardly be made out even with the strongest powers of the microscope. In plants, the cell membrane is composed of cellulose, a carbo- hydrate very nearly allied to starch. The presence of this sub- stance may generally be easily demonstrated by a very character- istic reaction. If a section of a plant tissue, or a single plant cell, is saturated first with a dilute solution of iodine in potassic iodide, and then (after the excess of the iodine solution has been removed) the preparation is immersed in sulphuric acid (2 parts acid to 1 part water), the cell membranes assume a lighter or darker blue coloration. Another reaction for cellulose is seen when chlorzinc- iodine solution is used (Schulze's solution). The membranes of plant cells often become thick and firm, and then they show, in section, a distinctly marked striation, being composed, like starch grains, of alternate bands of high and low A Fig. 71.

30 THE CELL -7> beyond a doubt the identity of saroode with the protoplasm of plant and animal cells; and this discovery was most helpful to Max Schultze in working out his cell theory, and in estab- lishing his tbeory of pro- toplasm (p. 6). In Amoeba, lymph cells, Mycetozoa, and Heticularia, we have learnt to recognise naked cells; those of plants on the contrary are almost invariably enclosed by a "well- defined layer, which is sometimes very thick and firm; this is also very frequently the case with animal cells (membrane, intercel- lular substance), and . thus in such cases_a 1 little chamber, or cell, in the true sense__of the word is formed. Young cells from the neighbourhood of the growing point of a plant, and cartilage cells from a Salaman- der larva, are very good examples of this. The cells at the growing point of a plant (Fig. ISA), where they multiply very rapidly, are very small, and are very similar to animal cells. They are only separated from one Fio.lO.-65-omiaoi^rmi..

329 METABOLIC CHANGES which is directed towards the ovum, whilst after the chorion has been completed, they retreat into the middle of the cell. Still more striking is the behaviour of the nuclei in the so-called double cells, which occur in the eggs of water-bugs (Eauatra and Nepa, Fig. 167 A, B). These develop radiating chitinous pro- cesses ou the chorion. The protoplasmic bodies of the two cells, between which a radiation figure develops, coalesce. During this process both of the very large nuclei extend numerous fine pro- cesses towards that side, which is turned towards the radiated figure. Fig. 166. Fig. 167.

The germinal vesicle of the ovum is extending processes towards the accumulations of granules. (After Korschelt, PI. I., Fig. 20.)

From these and similar observations, Haberlandt and Korschelt draw the following conclusions, respecting the function of the cell-nucleus:— 1. "The fact that the nucleus is generally found in a definite position in the immature and developing cells, indicates that its function is connected chiefly with the developmental processes of the cell." (Haberlandt.) 2. "From its position it may be concluded that the nucleus plays a definite part during the growth of the cell, especially during the thickening and increase in superficial growth of the

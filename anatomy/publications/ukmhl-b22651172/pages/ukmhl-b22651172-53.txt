ITS CHEMICO-PHYSICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 33 Fig. 13). Finally, in other cases, even these strands of protoplasm in the interior of the cell may disappear. Then the protoplasmic; substance is represented solely by a thin skin, which lines the interior of the little chamber, to use an expression of Sachs (II. 33), as the paper covers the walls of a room, and which con- tains one single large sap vacuole (Fig. 12 C, left lower cell, and Fig. 59). In very large cells this coating is sometimes so thin that, except for the nucleus, the presence of protoplasm can hardly be demonstrated at all in the cell, even when a high power of the microscope is used, so that special methods of investigation are necessary in order to render it visible.

It was by the study of such cells, that the earlier investigators, such as Treviranus, Schleiden, and Schwann, arrived at their conception of the cell. Hence it is not surprising that they con- sidered that the cell membrane and the nucleus constituted the essential portions of the cell, and quite overlooked the importance of the protoplasm. That this latter is the true living body in the plant-cell too, and that it is able to exist independently of the D

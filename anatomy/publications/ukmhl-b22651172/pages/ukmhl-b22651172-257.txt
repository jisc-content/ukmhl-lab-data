THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF THE CELL 237 of the second division following so closely on the first that the resting condition was missed, an augmentation of nuclear sub- stance, and an increase in the number of the nuclear segments, through longitudinal cleavage, have been unable to take place. In consequence, the number of segments has been diminished or reduced to half the normal number. In exactly the same way division with reduction occurs in the egg of Ascaris megalocephala during the process of ripening. The sperm-mother-cell corresponds to the unripe egg, or egg- mother-cell. Here also eight nuclear segments, arranged in two bundles, develop in the germinal vesicle (Fig. 127 L). After the nuclear membrane has been dissolved, they arrange themselves in the equator of the first direction spindle, which rises up to the surface of the yolk (Fig. 127 II.), and in the manner already I. IT. nr. Fig. 127.-Diagram of the development of polar-cells and tbo fertilisation of the egg of Ascaris megalocephala bivalcn*. described (p. 228) forms the first polar-cell. This process corre- sponds to the division of the sperm-mother-cell into two daughter- cells. As before (Fig. 126 I.), each of the two unequally large products of division, viz. the egg-daughter-cell and the polar-cell

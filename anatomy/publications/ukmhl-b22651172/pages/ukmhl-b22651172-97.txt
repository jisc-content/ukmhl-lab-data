77 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL Once for all, it must be admitted that none of the hypotheses which have, up till now, been propounded, are able to furnish us with a satisfactory conception of the causes and mechanical con- ditions of the plasmic movements, and that, therefore, we must confine ourselves to a simple description of observed conditions. This, however, is not to be wondered at, when we consider what n„r°; A2r1i£ferent np'iearances "turned by drops of oil, which have spreud themselves out. (After Venvorn, Fig. 11.) a number of different opinions are held with regard to the ultimate structure of protoplasm itself (see pp. 18-26), and this must of course affect the explanations tendered of its movements II.

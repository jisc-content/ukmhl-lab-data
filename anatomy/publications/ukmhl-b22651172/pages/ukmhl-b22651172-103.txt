E Movement of an ordinary sper- matozoon ; a b c various phases of this movement. b. Cells with numerous Cilia. The Infusoria are chiefly to be distinguished from other unicellular organisms by the large numherof cilia they possess, on which account they are called Ciliata (Fig. 48). Cilia are much smaller than flagella, be- inp-, as a rule, about '1 to "3 /x thick, and about 15 /x long. They may number many thousands. For example, it has been calculated, that the Paramcecium aurelia possesses approximately 2,500. As for the Balantidium elongation, which is parasitic in the Frog, and which is very thickly ciliated, Biitschli (III. 3) is of opinion that it has nearly ten thousand cilia ; these are generally arranged in several longitudinal rows, which either encircle the body in spirals, or are con- lined to a certain portion of its sur- face. In addition to the cilia, many Infusoria possess special large organs of locomotion, cirri, and undulating membranes.

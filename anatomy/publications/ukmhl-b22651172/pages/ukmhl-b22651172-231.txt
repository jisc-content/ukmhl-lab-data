It is apparently connected with metabolic processes in tbe nucleus (cf. what is said upon the subject in Chapter VIII,). Nuclear multiplication by direct division occurs also amongst Protista; it is seen with especial frequency in the group of Acinetas, of which the Podophrya gemmipara (Fig. 104), described on p. 229, is an instructive example. 3.

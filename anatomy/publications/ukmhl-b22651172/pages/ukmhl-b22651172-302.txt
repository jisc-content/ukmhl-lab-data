THE CELL 282 the top of the water, two threads lie in contact with one another for any considerable portion of their length, conjugation occurs between neighbouring cells. As a rule all the cells prepare for reproduction at the same time by sending out lateral processes to- wards each other. These fuse at the point of contact, whilst the separating wall dissolves, and thus transverse canals are formed, which connect the conjugating threads at regular distances, and Fig. 153.â€”Spirogyra longata (after Sachs, Fig. 410). To the left, several cells of two fila- ments, which are about to conjugate: they show the spiral chlorophyll hands, in which crown-like arrangements of starch grains are lying, as well as small drops of oil. The nucleus of each cell is surrounded by protoplasm, from which threads stretch to the cell- wall, b, preparatory to conjugation. To the right, A, cells engaged in conjugation : the protoplasm of the one cell is just passing over into the other at a; in b the two proto- plasmic masses have already united. In S, the young zygotes are surrounded by a wall. resemble the rungs of a ladder (Fig. 153). The protoplasmic bodies of the cells then contract away from their cellulose wall, and after a time fuse together. Differences which in themselves are trifling, but which on that

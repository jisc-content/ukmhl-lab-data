228 THE OEIdi smaller cell, richer in protoplasm, and a larger one, richer in yolk; in these segmentation proceeds at different rates. Ic. Cell-Budding. When one of the portions produced hy division is so much smaller than the other, that it appears as though it were only a small appendage to the original cell, scarcely causing any diminution of its substance, the process is called "cell-budding, or gemmative segmentation," the smaller portion being called the bud, and the larger the mother-cell. Two kinds of cell-budding are distinguished, according to whether one or more buds are formed. In the animal kingdom this process of cell-budding occurs when the egg is mature, causing the development of the directive cor- puscles, or polar bodies (polar cells). By this term we understand two or three small spherules, which are composed of protoplasm and nuclear substance, and hence are of the same value as small cells; they are frequently situated at the animal pole of the egg, within the vitelline membrane. The coui^se of the process of cell- budding is as follows :— Whilst the germinal vesicle is becoming broken up, a typical / II. III. IV. V. VI.

In Fig. II. a small protuberance (rfc,1) has been formed, which receives half of the spindle. In Fig. III. the protuberance is constricted off, forming a polar cell (rk>)- Out of the remaining half of the original spindle, a second complete spindle («p) has developed. In Fig. IV. a second protuberance has bulged out below the first polar cell, which in Fig. V. becomes constricted off to form the second polar cell (rk»). In Fig. VI. out of the remainder of the spindle the egg nucleus (rt) develops.

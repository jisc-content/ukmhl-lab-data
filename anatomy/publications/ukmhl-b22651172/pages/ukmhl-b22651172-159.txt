139 THE VITAL PROPERTIES OF THE CELL inducing a flow of water towards the exterior. " Essentially osmosis consists in thfe. that two fluids simultaneously pass through a membrane in opposite directions; with regard to an endosmotic equivalent (a term expressing the proportionate inter- change, upon which there is frequently too much stress laid), this cannot be spoken of in such cases where only water is diosmosed through a membrane " (Pfeffer V. 23). On account of their fragility and small size, experiments upon osmosis can only be made in animal cells with great difficulty. Hence the osmotic processes have been investigated chiefly by botanists in plant cells, which are much more suitable, and our Fig. 59.â€”1. A young, at most half-grown, cell from the cortical parenchyma of the flower peduncle of Cephalaria leucantha. 2. The same cell immersed in a 4 per cent, solution. 3. The same cell in a 6 per cent, solution. 4. The same cell in a 10 per cent, solution (Nos. 1 and 4 are taken from nature, Nos. 2 and 3 are diagrammatic ; nil in optical longitudinal section). It Peripheral layer ; p protoplasmic coating of wall; 7c nucleus; c chlorophyll granules; s cell sap; e salt solution which has penetrated into the interior. After de Vries (V. 36). knowledge has been especially advanced by the following experi- ments. If plant cells containing a large sap space are placed in a 5 to 20 per cent, solution of a suitable salt, or of sugar or glucose (Fig. 59), they are seen to diminish somewhat in size from having given up water from the intei'ior to the exterior; in consequence, as this process of water abstraction proceeds, the protoplasmic coating becomes separated from the cellulose membrane, which, on account of its greater firmness, is unable to shrink any more (de Vries V. 36).

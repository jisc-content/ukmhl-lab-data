258 THE CKU, 139 A, B), there is a much smaller spherule, around which the yolk commences to arrange itself in radial strise (Pig. 140 4), forming a radiated figure (a star) ; this star grows gradually more distinct, and at the same time extends itself farther away from the spherule. Since it seems to be derived from the neck of the Fig. 139. A and B represent portions of a section of a fertilised egi-of Asteracanthion. A centrosome (sperm-centrum) has moved out a little in advance of the sperm-nucleus (After Pol.) spermatozoon, Fol has called it the sperm-centrum (male centro- some). A corresponding spherule can be seen close to the egg- nucleus, on that side which is turned away from the sperm- nucleus ; Fol has called this the ovo-centrum (female centrosome). Fig. 140â€”A Fertilised egg of a Sea-urchin (0. Hertwig, Embryology, Fig. 18). The head of the spermatozoon, which has penetrated into the egg, has been converted into a sperm-nucleus (s/t) surrounded by a protoplasmic radiation, and has approached the ege- nucleus (ek). B Fertilised egg of a Sea-urchin (O. Hertwig, Embryology, Fig. 19). The sperm-nucleus (sfc) and the egg-nucleus (efc) have approached each other, and are both surrounded by a protoplasmic radiation. An interesting phenomenon now commences to attract attention (Fig. 140 A, B). The egg- and sperm-nuclei (male and female pro-nuclei) mutually attract each other, as it were simultaneously, and travel through the yolk towards each other with increasing velocity; the sperm-nucleus (sk) with its radiation containing the centrosome always moving in front of it, travels more quickly than the egg-nucleus (ek) with its ovo-centrum. Soon they

195 THE VITAL PHENOMENA OF TIIE CELL For examination with reagents, and especially for studying chromatin figures, the eggs oE Echinoderms are not so suitable as those of Ascaris. The loop-like nuclear segments are especially small and numerous in them, so that even with the strongest powers they only look like small granules. Fig. 91 represents a spindle, which has been treated with reagents and staining solu- tions ; it corresponds somewhat to Fig. 89, where the living egg is depicted, and may therefore be considered to complete it. The process of segmentation may take a fairly long time in very large eggs, such as Frogs' eggs, where a considerable amount of mm Fig. 91.

Fig. 92.—A portion of the upper hemisphere of an egg of Sana temporaria a quarter of an hour after the appearance of the first furrow, when the coronal radiation is most sharply and plainly defined. (After Max Schultze, PI. I., Fig. 2.) yolk has to be divided. Consequently a second process of division may commence before the first is completed. In Frogs' eggs an intez-estiiig appearance may be observed, which has been described under the name of the coronal furrow (VI. 68) (Fig. 92). This first furrow commences to appear on a small area o£ the black pigmented hemisphere of the egg, which is directed upwards; as it penetrates into the substance, it increases in length, and, during the course of half an hour, extends itself round the whole peri- phery of the globe, appearing last upon the bright surface, which is turned downwards. At this place it penetrates less deeply into the yolk. When it first appears, it is not smooth in appearance,

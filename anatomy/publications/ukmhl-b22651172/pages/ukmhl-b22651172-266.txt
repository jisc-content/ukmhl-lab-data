The framework of the nuclei disintegrates, and the nuclein collects together into a compact mass, which is re- markable for its strong affinity for the most various stains. The protoplasm diminishes in quantity, in proportion to that present in similar normal germ cells. Such a stunted cell with a cora- A Fig. 136.â€”A Sperm cejl with a degenerated nucleus from the testis of a Salamandra maculata (from Flemming, PI. 25, Fig. 51a).

A is a germinal oell from the testis of Salamandra; B, a germinal cell of Ascaris, such as is found both in the testis and ovary, and which is known by the name of corps residuel, or residuary body. Wasielewski, by injecting turpentine into the testes of mammals, has succeeded in inducing experimentally a similarly degenerated condition in the nuclei of germ cells. Concerning the physiological importance of the nuclear division processes, compare Chapter IX., section 3, especially that portion dealing with the equal distribution of the multiplying inherited mass amongst the cells proceeding from the fertilised egg.

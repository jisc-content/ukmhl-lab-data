CHAPTER VIII. METABOLIC CHANGES BETWEEN PROTOPLASM, NUCLEUS, AND CELL PEODUCTS. All the morphologically different parts of a living organism necessarily stand to one another in a definite relation, as regards metabolic changes. In most cases it is extremely difficult to understand these relations, on account of the complexity of the vital processes. However, some knowledge has already been gained upon the subject, by means of observation and experiment, and the fact that protoplasm takes part in all formative processes, such as the formation of the cell-wall, of intercellular substance, etc., is indicated by various circumstances, which can scarcely be explained in any other manner. In plants the main portion of the protoplasm is always massed together at those parts, where growth is chiefly taking place: e.g. at the ends of growing root-hairs, in the growing hyphse, with Fungi, etc., and at the growing points of multicellular and uni- cellular plants, such as Caulerpa. Further, the protoplasm, in individual cells, always accumulates in the regions of greatest activity. Sometime before the cellulose membrane of a plant-cell forms thickenings or sculpturings, the protoplasm undei-goes prepara- tory changes, by collecting in the places where the most rapid growth is taking place. Further, whilst these thickenings are being formed, continuous streams of granular protoplasm are seen to pass along them. If a small portion of Vaucheria is cut off, the protoplasm im- mediately tries to repair the injury. " Granular plasma can be seen to collect in dense masses about the wound, and to close up to form a layer, which is sharply defined externally. A cell- membrane immediately commences to develop upon this layer." (Klebs.) If the protoplasm of a plant-cell has by means of plasmolysis been separated from its membrane, without damage having been 3?a

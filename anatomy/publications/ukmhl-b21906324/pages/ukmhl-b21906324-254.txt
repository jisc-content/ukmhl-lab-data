2U POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. In endometritis, the internal surface is covered with a thicker layer of gangrenous material, and there are patches of croiipous exudation whicli may extend into the vagina. The uterine siMuses are filled with thrombi, for the most part broken down into a puriform fluid. There may be also a diffuse purulent infiltration of the uterine wall, or circumscribed abscesses. Yery frequently there are also peritonitis and pytemic infarctions of the viscera. TJLCEEATION. PTiagedosnic or Corroding Ulcer.—This rare form of ulcera- tion usually occurs in old age, without assignable cause. It begins in the cervix and extends gradually imtil it may destroy the greater part of the uterus. It may even invade the blad- der and rectum. The ulcer is of irregular form, its base is rough and blackish, its walls indurated. Syphilitic Ulceration may attack the vaginal portion or inte- rior of the cervix, or the internal surface of the body of the uterus. It has the usual forms of the hard and soft chancre. Catarrhal Ulceration is most common in the cervix. It ac- companies catarrhal endometritis. The ulcers are superficial erosions or formed from inflamed follicles. DEGENERATION. Waxy Degeneration has been observed by Yirchow in one case. The uterus was liypertrophied and the muscle-cells were infiltrated with the waxy material. NEW GROWTHS. ' Myoma.—Tliese tumors, often called fibrous tumors, are very common in the uterus. They occur after puberty, and usually in advanced life. They are usually multiple, and may reach an immense size. Their favorite situation is the body of the uterus, rarely the cervix. According to their position we may distinguish a subserous, submucous, and intra-parietal form. The subserous myomata grow from the outer muscular lay-

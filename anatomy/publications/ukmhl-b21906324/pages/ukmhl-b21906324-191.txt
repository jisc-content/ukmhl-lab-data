THE LIVER, 181 begins at an early stage of the disease, and increases constant- ly. It usually precedes oedema of tlie feet, but both may appear at tlie same time. This fluid is of a clear yellow or brown, green or red ; it is sometimes mixed with shreds of fibrine, and more rarely with blood. The pei'itoneum remains normal, or becomes opaque and thick, or there may be adhesions between the viscera. The spleen is very fi-equently enlarged, and the enlargement may be very considerable. When it is not increased in size, this is usually due to previous atrophy of the organ, or to fibrous thickening of its capsule, or to haemorrhages from the stomach and bowels, occurring just before death. The stomach and intestines are often secondarily aiFected by the obstruction to the portal circulation. Profuse hasmorrhage from the stomach and intestines may occur, and sometimes causes sudden death. The mucous mem- brane is then found pale, or congested, or with hsemorrhagic erosions. Sometimes the blood is infiltrated in the coats of the stomach and intestines. The mucous membrane of the stom- ach, and of the entire length of the intestines, is sometimes imi- formly and intensely congested, and coated with mucus. In other cases both the mucous and muscular coats are pale, but very markedly thickened. The causes of cirrhosis are not well known. It is a disease of adult life, and is often found in habitual drinkers; but there are many cases in which no cause can be discovered. SIMPLE INDURATION OF THE LIVER. This name has been given to a variety of chronic interstitial hepatitis, in which the new fibrous tissue has a difiierent arrange- ment. It is produced in masses of considerable size, which re- place the hepatic tissue, and are smooth and dense. In a considerable number of cases, this lesion occurs in per- sons who have been the subject of constitutional syphilis. The history of the disease is the same as that of cirrhosis.

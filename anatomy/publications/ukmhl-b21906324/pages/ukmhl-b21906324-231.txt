THE URINARY BLADDER. 221 The bladder may be separated into an npper and a lower portion by a circular constriction. It may be completely or incompletely divided by a vertical septixm into two lateral portions. Diverticula of the wall are also found in new-born children. Partial or complete closure of the neck of the bladder also occurs. CHANGES IN SIZE AND POSITION. Dilatation of the bladder is produced by the accumulation of urine in consequence of some mechanical obstacle to its escape, or of paralysis of its muscular walls. The dilatation is uni- form, and may reach a great size. If the walls of the bladder are paralyzed, the dilatation is accompanied by thinning of the wall, or it may retain its normal thickness. If the escape of the urine is prevented by a mechanical obstacle, the walls of the bladder are usually hypertrophied, but may be thinned. The retained urine frequently decomposes, and produces inflam- matory and gangrenous changes in the mucous membrane. In the foetus, dilatation of the bladder may reach such a size as to interfere with delivery. I have seen, in a foetus born at term, dilatation and hyper- trophy of the bladder, dilatation of the ureters, a diverticulum at the neck of the bladder, and no apparent obstacle to the escape of urine. Diverticula of the bladder are produced by the protrusion of the mucous coat between the hyperti-ophied bundles of muscular fibres. They may be single or multiple, small, or so large as nearly to fill the abdomen. Their walls are composed of mucous membrane thickened, and of peritoneum, if in the proper position. They communicate with the bladder by a small cleft. The urine which fills them may decompose and excite inflammation. Calculi may be formed in them. Hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the bladder is usually produced by mechanical obstructions to the outflow of urine, such as stricture of the urethra, enlarged prostate, calculi, new growths, etc. The muscular coat is thickened uniformly, or

104 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS, (1.) Severe contusions of the thorax may produce rupture, usually of one of the auricles. (2.) Spentaneous rupture occurs usually in advanced life. The left ventricle is the cavity most frequently ruptured. There is usually one rupture, sometimes two; five have been seen. The rupture is usually oblique, larger internally than externally; there may even be a small cavity filled with blood in the heart- wall. The heart-wall may be of normal thickness, or thin ; it is soft and friable, the muscular fibres advanced in fatty degene- ration. The rupture usually takes place while the patient is quiet. Death is usually instantaneous, but sometimes does not ensue for several hours. Rupture of the inner layers only of the lieart-wall may give rise to aneurisms of the heart. In rare cases, circumscribed inflammation, abscesses, hydatids, and tumors may produce rupture. (3.) In very rare cases, rupture is produced by stenosis of the aorta and dilatation of the heart cavities. (4.) Eupture of the papillary muscles and tendons is produced by fatty and atlieromatous processes. INFLAMMATION. MYOCARDITIS. Our knowledge of inflammation of the walls of the heart is still imperfect. The distinction between parenchymatous de- generation, and parenchymatous inflammation and their rela- tions to changes in the interstitial connective tissue, are obscure. In chronic pericarditis with eff'usion, we may find in the outer layers of muscle marked granular degeneration of the muscular fibrilljB. This may be looked on as a parenchymatous inflam- mation, due to irritation, or as a simple degeneration from im- paired nutrition. A general and acute inflammation of the entire heart is do- scribed by Rindfleisch. It occurred in a man with a syphilitic history, and caused sudden death. The heart-walls were firm and stiff', the muscular tissue was of a fresh violet red color, iridescent, semi-translucent, of the consistence of caoutchouc.

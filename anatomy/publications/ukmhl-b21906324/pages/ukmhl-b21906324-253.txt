THE UTERUS. 2-A3 tritis. The organ is swollen, succulent, congested; the mucous membrane covered with muco-pus; the peritoneal coat congested. There may be small extravasations of blood in the wall or cavity of the uterus. The inflammation, in rare cases, becomes suppu- rative, and abscesses are formed in the uterine wall. These may perforate into the peritoneal cavity or into the rectum. Chronic Metritis is the result of an acute metritis, or accom- panies acute or chronic endometritis; or is idiopathic. The uterine walls become thick and hard. Many of the cases called chronic metritis are only catarrhal endometritis with hypertro- phy of the nterus. Perimetritis.—peritoneal coat of the nterus may be in- flamed with the production of membranous adhesions or of pus. The adhesions may be small or very extensive. The inflamma- tion usually accompanies chronic metritis and endometritis. In prostitutes, adhesions are almost the rule. Parametritis.—Tlie connective tissue about the uterus, be- tween that organ and the reflexions of the peritoneum, may be the seat of suppurative inflammation. It most frequently causes the death of the patient. 2. Of the Pregnant Uterus. The same forms of inflammation which have just been de- scribed may attack the pregnant uterus. Catarrhal endometritis may produce eflTusion of serum, extra- vasations of blood, and abortions. Metritis may lead to softening of the uterine wall, so tliat ruptures take place during labor. Perimetritis and parametritis produce adhesions and abscesses about the uterus.

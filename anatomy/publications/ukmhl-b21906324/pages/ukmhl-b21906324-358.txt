348 POST-MOETEM EXAMINATIONS. OPIUM. The post-mortem appearances in persons wlio have been killed by any of the preparations of opium are negative. Con- gestion of the brain and of the lungs are spoken of by most aiTthors, but they seem to depend principally on the way in which the patient dies, rather than on any specific action of the di'ug.

The different preparations of alcohol, when taken in large quantities, sometimes produce sudden coma and death in from half an hour to several hours. The bodies are said to resist decomposition for an unusual length of time. The stomach and tissues often have an alco- holic smell.

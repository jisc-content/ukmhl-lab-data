94 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. Sarcoma and Carcinoma grow as primary tumors -within the mediastinum. They originate in the periosteiim of the ster- num, in the outer layers of the parietal pericardium, and in the connective tissue of the mediastinum. They grow very rapidly, fill up a large part of the thorax, compress and invade the neighboring soft parts, and form metastatic tumors in other organs. Teratoma myomatodes.â€”Under this name Virchow describes a very remarkable tumor. It grew I'apidly in a man, aged 22, of good constitution and physical development. The right pleural cavity was nearly filled with a solid growth. There were similar growths, of smaller size, on the left rib, in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The mediastinal tumor consisted of two portions, a larger and a smaller. The larger portion consisted of solid tissiie, in which were a few cavities. It was very vascular. Part of it was composed of dense fibrous tissue. The greater portion, however, con- sisted of loose connective tissue fibres, of fusiform cells, and of large, many-nucleated cells. Some of the fusiform cells were small, and of the usual appearance; but many were large, and presented striations like those of young voluntary muscle. The smaller jwrtion of the tumor looked like a multilocular cystoid. The cj'sts varied much in size, and contained serum, colloid matter, and blood. Some of the cysts contained a thick, white material, in which were hairs, epidermic scales, ciliated epithelium, and cholesterine. In the fibrous tissue about these cysts were pieces of hyaline cartilage. Is^ear the suriace of the tumor the tissue consisted of a fibro-cellular stroma forming alveoli filled with epithelium. The tumor on the third left rib consisted of connective tissue fibres and cells, muscle cells, cysts, alveoli filled with epithelium, and a small portion of tissue resembling foetal lung.

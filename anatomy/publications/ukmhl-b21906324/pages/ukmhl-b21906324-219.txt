209 THE KIDNEYS, INFLAMMATION. Acute diffuse Nephritis. Tills condition of the kidneys is found with scarhatina, and as an acute disease after exposure to cold. It is usually de- scribed as the first stage of chronic diffuse nephritis or Briglit's Disease ; in my opinion, improperly.

The Malpighian bodies are sometimes filled with extravasated blood. The intertubular connective tissue is infiltrated with a variable amount of serum and lym- phoid cells. Glomeriolo-Nephritis.â€”Under this name, Klebs describes a modification of the condition just described. It is found with scarlatina. The Malpighian bodies appear large and white. Their capsules are filled with small cells, which compress the capillary tufts. Chronic diffuse Nephritis. This disease is also known under the names of parenchyma- tous nephritis, Bright's Disease, granular kidney, fatty kidney, etc. It is the ordinary form of chronic renal disease, with which 14

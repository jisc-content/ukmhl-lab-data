365 TUMORS. form cells, which have a strong tendency to undergo cheesy and fibrous degeneration. The larger tumors are formed by an ag- gregation of smaller growths. They are frequently associated with a new growth of fibrous tissue. They have been observed in nearly all parts of the body. III. Lujous.—This new growth is usually treated of with diseases of the skin. It consists in the formation of small round cells in the deep layers of the cutis. The cell-growth goes on until all the tissues of the skin are replaced by the round cells ; then the epidermis falls off, and ulcers are formed. These ulcers may become deep and broad, and if they cicatrize and contract, produce great de- formities. The gross appearances vary according to the size and distri- bution of the nodules of new growth, and their tendency to ulceration. lY. Lymphoma.—This name is given to tumors which are composed of tissue like that of the lymphatic glands, that is, of a delicate reticulum of branched fibrous tissue holding together a great number of small, round cells. The growth occurs as an hypertrophy of normal glands, and as an heteroplastic growth in connective tissue and in the viscera. V. Sarcoma.—This name is given to tumors which are prin- cipally composed of connective-tissue cells. According to the difierent forms of connective tissue, we can distinguish Sarcoma proper, composed of round, oval, fusiform, and stellate cells, with a fibrous basement substance. Myxo-Sarcoma, composed of the same cells, the stellate form predominating, and of a mucous basement substance. Chondro-Sarcoma, composed of cartilaginous tissue, but with the cells greatly in excess. Osteo-Sarcoma, composed of osteoid tissue, with the cells in excess. Glio-Sarcoma, composed of neuroglia, with the cells in excess. As it is customary to speak of connective tissue proper and of the connective-tissue group of bone, cartilage, mucous tissue, and neuroglia, so we may also speak of sarcoma proper.

Whether the new growth of cells begins in the normal glandular follicles, in the connective tissue, or in the lymphatic vessels, is still an open question. If the cells are numerous and the stroma scanty, the growth is called a medullary cancer; if the cells are few and the stroma abundant, a scirrhus cancer; if there are hardly any cells and a dense, hard, retracted stroma, an atrophic cancer. All these forms are accompanied by secondary and metasta- tic growths. The axillary glands, the skin of the thorax, the liver, the bones, and nearly all the viscera may be the seats of metastatic tumors. Alveolar or colloid carcinoma is rare.

POST-itORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 96 amount of serum, which liinders the movements and the nou- rishment of the heart. HiEMOERHAGE. Extravasations of blood in the cavity of the pericardium are produced by wounds and rupture of tlie heart, rupture of the aorta and of aneurisms, and occur with pericarditis. Small extravasations in the substance of the pericardium are found with scurvy, purpura, fevers, etc. PNEUMATOSIS. Air in the pericardium is sometimes found as a post-mortem appearance, accompanied with drying of portions of the peri- cardium. Wounds or paracentesis of the pericardium ; the perfoi'a- tion of ulcers of the stomach, cavities of the lungs, and ulcers of the oesophagus may admit air into the pericardial cavity. Pericarditis, with foul, piirulent exudation, may evolve gases. INTLAMMATION. Pericarditis.â€”The earliest change in pericarditis is a con- gestion of the pericardium; this, however, we very frequently fail to find at the post-mortem. Small ecchymoses are not uncommon. The inflammation is attended with the produc- tion of serum, fibrine, pus, and blood in variable quantities. In very mild cases, there are only one or two ounces of turbid serum in the pericardium. In severer cases, the serum reaches the amount of several ounces, or even pounds, accumulating first at the base of tlie heart, and afterward surrounding it more uniformly. Instead of turbid serum there may be great numbers of pus globules, so that the pericarditis is suppurative. In rare cases, the pus may become foul and gangrenous. In other cases, there is but little serum or pus; but the peri- cardium is coated with fibrine in a thin layer, or iu large quan- tities, sticking the visceral and parietal i)ericardium loosely together.

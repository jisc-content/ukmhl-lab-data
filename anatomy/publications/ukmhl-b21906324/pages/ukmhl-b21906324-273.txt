Tiie growth consists in a deve- lopment of connective tissue from tlie deep layers of the cutis, and is sometimes accompanied by dilatation of the lymphatic vessels. â–  THE TESTICLES. MALFORMATIONS. Absence of all the organs of generation is found in connec- tion with other extensive malformations. Absence of both testicles, either with or without absence of the epididyines, spermatic cord, and vesiculjB seminales, occiu's in rare cases. The scrotum is only indicated, or may contain the epididymes. The penis is small, and the individuals are small and poorly develojied. Instead of being entirely wanting, the testes may be imper- fectly developed. The individuals are weakly and etfeminate. Absence of one testicle, with healthy development of the other, is more frequent. The corresponding epididymis and cord may be absent or present. The spermatic cords and vesiculse seminales may be absent or imperfectly developed on one or both sides, while the testes are normal. Either one or both testicles may remain permanently in their foetal position, or may not descend into the scrotum for several years after birth. Their descent may even be delayed until the thirtieth year of life. This condition may depend on an arrest of development in the testes, or the gubernaculum testis; on adhesions produced by intra-uterine peritonitis ; on narrowing of the inguinal canal; on narrowing or shortening of the vaginal process of the peri- toneum ; or on abnormal size or position of the testicle. Usually the malformation is confined to one testicle, and then is more frequent on the left side. The testicle is found in the abdomen close to the mouth of the inguinal canal; in the inguinal canal, just below the exter- nal ring; beneath the skin in the perineum; or in the crui'al canal with the femoral vessels.

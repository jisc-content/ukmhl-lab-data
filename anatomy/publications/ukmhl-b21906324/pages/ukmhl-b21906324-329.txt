319 TYPHUS FEVER. The Spleen is often coated with exudation. It is always enlarged, congested, soft, and may undergo spontaneous rupture. In most cases, it is filled with countless small, grayish nodules— the enlarged Malpighian bodies. These afterward soften and form little abscesses. Infarctions are not uncommon. The Stomach and Intestines are often the seat of catarrhal and croupous inflammation. The solitary and agminated folli- cles are not enlarged. The Mesenteric Glands and the other lymphatic glands in the abdomen are usually enlarged. The Kidneys are frequently congested, or anaemic, and the seat of parenchymatous degeneration. TYPHUS FEVER. The lesions of typhus fever are variable and not very charac- teristic. The Skin.—The regular eruption of typhus disappears after death, but sometimes small ecchymoses remain. Gangrene from bed-sores, and of the toes from thrombosis, are sometimes seen. Decomposition commences early, and the blood is unusually fluid and prone to stain the vessels. The Brain usually presents no lesions. Acute meningitis is said sometimes to occur. The Pharynx and Larynx may be the seat of catarrhal or diphtheritic inflammation. Gangrenous inflammation of the walls of the mouth may occur. Suppurative inflammation of the parotid glands is not uncommon. The Lungs.—Bronchitis frequently exists. Hypostatic con- gestion, lobular and lobar pneumonia and infarctions are sometimes found. The Heart is soft and flabby. Its muscular fibres are often filled with granules. The Spleen is usually large and soft. There may be infarc- tions. The Liver and Kidneys may present the same parenchyma- tous degeneration as is observed in typhoid fever.

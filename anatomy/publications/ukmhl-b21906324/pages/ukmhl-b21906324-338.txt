POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 328 Unfortunately, under the same name of Addison's Disease, different observers have described cases in which the symptoms and bronzed skin existed without disease of the supra-renal capsules ; cases in which the bronzed skin was the only lesion ; cases in which the supra-renal capsules were diseased without symptoms or bronzed skin. In the present state of our knowledge, we have to admit that the connection between the color of the skin, the condition of the supra-renal capsules, and the symptoms is an unsolved pro- blem. Each of the three conditions, the symptoms, the colored skin, and the diseased capsules may exist separately, and yet in a very considerable number of cases they are combined. I can only, therefore, give such lesions as have been observed, without implying that they are the universal or necessary lesions of the disease. The Skin.—The pigmentation resembles that of the negro. It is a diffuse or granular pigmentation of the inner layers of the rete Malpighii. Sometimes pigment is found along the nerves and vessels in the cutis. The Brain.—Softening, hydrops of the ventricles, pigmenta- tion of the gray matter, exudation on the arachnoid, hyperae- mia and ansemia of the brain, chronic inflammation, degenera- tion of the hypophysis cerebri, and concretions in the medulla oblongata have all been observed. The SympathetiG Nerves.—Atrophy, fatty degeneration, hy- persemia, pigmentation, and fibrous degeneration, esj)ecially affecting the abdominal portion of the sympathetic, have been described. The Supra-renal Capsules.—The most frequent lesion is pro- duced by a chronic inflammation with cheesy degeneration. Less frequently, tubercles, carcinoma, apoplexy, fatty and waxy degeneration have been observed. The most striking cases are tliose in which at the autopsy no other lesions exist, nor can any other cause for death be found than the change in the supra-renal capsules.

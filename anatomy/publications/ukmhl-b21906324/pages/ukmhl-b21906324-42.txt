32 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. witli ciliated epithelium, continuous with the uterine mucous membrane. THE EXAMINATION OF THE BODIES OF NEW-BORN INFANTS. In examining the bodies of new-born children, we have to con- sider, besides the ordinary lesions of disease, the age of the child ; whether it was born alive ; how long it has been dead; what was the cause of death. EXTERNAL INSPECTIGN. The Size and Age.â€”Casper gives the following description of the foetus during the different months of intra-uterine life: At the fourth week, the embryo is 4-6 lines long. The cleft of the mouth and two points representing the eyes can be recog- nized in the head. The extremities are rej)resented by little wart-like projections. The heart can be distinguished; the liver is disproportionately large. The umbilical vessels are not formed. The entire ovum has the size of a walnut. At the eighth week, the embryo is 15-18 lines long. The head forms more than a third of the entire body. The nose and lips can be distinguished, but not the external ear. The hand is longer than the fore-arm, the fingers are formed, but joined to- gether by a gelatinous mass ; the toes look like little buds ; the soles of the feet are turned inward. The arms appear as points. The abdomen is closed. All the viscera can be recog- nized. Points of ossification are formed in the apophysis of the first cervical vertebra, the humerus, radius, scapula, ribs, and cranial bones. There are rudimentary external genitals, but the sex can hardly be distinguished. The ovum reaches the size of a hen's egg. At the twelfth week, the placenta is formed. The embryo is 2-2^ inches long, and weighs three ounces. The eyes and mouth are closed. The neck separates the head from the thorax. The nails can be recognized on the fingers. The sex can be recog- nized. The umbilical cord is inserted near the pubes. The

THE TRACHEA. 69 1 and ci'icoicl cartilages as flat or globular tumors. They usually grow inward, and may be mistaken for polypi. They may become ossified. Ej)iihelial Cancer may appear in any part of the larynx. It forms irregular, fungous, ulcerating masses, projecting into the cavity of the larynx. The new growth may also involve the parts about the larynx and form tumors in the neck. These external tumors are often surrounded by inflamed and suppurat- ing tissue. Carcinoma as a primarj^ disease seldom occurs in the larynx. It forms nodules in the submucous tissue, which may enlarge, project inward, and ulcerate. Sarcoma occurs in the form of polypoid tumors growing from the submucous tissue. PARASITES. In the catarrhal and croupous exudations of the larynx, the spores and tliallus of fungi are often found. Some authors re- gard them as the cause of diphtheritic inflammation. THETRACHEA. MALFORMATIONS. The trachea may be entirely absent. It may communicate with the ffisophagus. There may be little fistulous canals open- ing from it, which j)enetrate the skin of the neck. The carti- lages may be increased or diminished in number, or parts of them may be wanting. The trachea may divide into three bronchi instead of two. It may be misplaced on the left side of, or behind the aesophagus. ALTERATIONS IN SIZE. A uniform dilatation of the trachea is sometimes seen in old persons as a consequence of long-continued catarrhal inflamma- tion. â–  Rokitansky describes a peculiar dilatation of the posterior wall. The ends of the cartilages are widely separated, the mu-

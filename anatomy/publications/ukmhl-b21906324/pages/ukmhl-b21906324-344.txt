The Lungs are usually congested and oedematous, but some- times do not difier from their ordinary appearance. There may be small patches of emphysema on the surface of the lungs. Sometimes, especially in infants, small ecchymoses are found in the costal and pulmonary pleura. The Heart usually presents its right cavities full of blood, its left cavities empty. The Abdominal Viscera are usually congested. DEATH FROM STRANGULATION. Strangulation is effected by the weight of the body in hang- ing ; by pressure on the neck with the hands ; or by constric- tion of the neck by a cord of some kind. Death is usually produced by the pressure on the larynx and trachea; that is, by asphyxia. In some cases, death appears to be caused by pres- sure on the large vessels of the neck; and, in some cases of hanging, by fracture or dislocation of the cervical vertebrae. External Inspection. The face may be livid and swollen, the eyes prominent, the lips swollen, and the tongue protruded. These appearances, however, â€¢are not the rule. Tlie greater number of those who die from strangulation cannot be distinguished by their faces from persons who have died in any otlier way. Erection of the penis, ejaculation of semen, and evacuation of ffeces and urine, are appearances on which some stress has been laid, but they do not appear to be constant or charac- teristic. In almost all cases, there are marks left on tlie neck by the implements which have produced the strangulation. In cases of suicidal lianging, the cord usually encircles the neck between tlie chin and the os' hyoides. The neck is but little compressed, while the cord leaves its mark behind the ears and on the sides of the occiput. When strangulation is

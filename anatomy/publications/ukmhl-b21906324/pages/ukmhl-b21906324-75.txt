THE SPINAL CORD, 65 NEW GROWTHS. Carcinoma,"Sarcoma, Tubercle, and Syphilitic Growths have all been observed in the cord. They resemble closely the same varieties of tumor in the brain. A very remarkable form of new gi^owth on the cord has been shown to me by Dr. E. C. Seguin. The patient was a woman, thirty years of age. Two years before her death, she received a severe blow on the back of the head. After this, first one side and then all the limbs became paralyzed. From this condition she recovered sufficiently to walk; but after a short time, she again grew worse, and both arms and legs were paralyzed and contractured. Slie died of bronchitis. At the autopsy there were found two tumors on the spinal cord within the dura mater. The upper tumor Avas on the anterior face of the cord just below the decussation of the medulla. It was of ovoid shape, and of the size of a pigeon's egg. It was composed of branched connective tissue with many round cells. The lower tumor was on the posterior face of the cord, at the upper part of the lumbar enlargement. It was of the size and shape of a large, flattened cherry. It was composed of portions of two spinal cords fused together, with their long axes parallel to that of the normal cord. There were four patches of gray matter, having the shape of the cornua, containing ganglion cells, and joined two and two by regular gray commissures, in each of which was a central canal. These gray portions were surrounded by tissue resembling the normal white substance of the cord. 5

THE INTESTINES. 159 of cliaiicres of the vulva and perineum. They may lead to in- duration and stenosis of the rectum. E3IB0LI. Emboli have been observed in the superior mesenteric artery in a number of instances ; in the inferior mesenteric they are less frequent. They produce ah intense congestion of the in- testine, usually with haemorrhage from the bowels during life. Tlie intestine appears of a livid red color, swollen, moist, some- times almost gangrenous. STENOSIS AND DILATATION. Stenosis of the intestine is produced by hypertrophy of the muscular coat, by cicatrices, by new growths, by the pressure of tumors, (in one case by the pressure of an anterior spina bifida on the rectum,) by peritoneal adhesions, by foreign bodies. Dilatation of the intestine is produced by the accumulation of fjBces and gas above a stricture, or by relaxation of the walls of the intestine from concussion, habitual repletion, peritonitis, rheumatism, typhus, dysentery, cholera, over-stimulation by in- jections, and purgatives, or from some disease of the nervous centres. In some cases, not only the calibre, but also the length of the intestine is increased. False Diverticida are formed by a hernial protrusion of the mucous and peritoneal coats. They form multiple nipple-shap- ed pouches, from the size of a pea to that of a walnut. They are usually on the convex side of the intestine, less frequently on its concave side. They are found at all parts of the large and small intestine. They usually cause no symptoms during life. In one case, however, they appeared to be the cause of an acute peritonitis, though no perforation was discovered. Dilatation of the Appendix Vermiformis is produced by the stenosis or occlusion of its canal at some point. Be^^ond the point of obstruction the canal dilates so as to form a large sac with thin walls. The contents of the sac are thick mucus and epithelium, or serum.

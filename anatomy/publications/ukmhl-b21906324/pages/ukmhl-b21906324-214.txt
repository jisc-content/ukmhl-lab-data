204 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. There may be little rounded nodules loosely attached to tlie surface of tlie capsules and with the same structure as these. If one of the kidneys is absent, or in an abnormal position, its capsule usually retains its proper position. II^MOKKIIAGE. In children, soon after birth, it is not very infrequent to find large haemorrhages in one of the capsules, converting it into a cyst filled with blood. The same lesion has been observed in a few cases in adults. THROMBOSIS. Klebs describes a case of capillary thrombosis of the cortex in both capsules in a woman after excision of the knee-joint. INFLAMMATION. The most frequent lesion of the capsules is their transforma- tion into fibrous tissue and cheesy matter. The capsules are then large, their surface smooth or lobulated, or they are con- tracted and irregular. The normal structure of the gland is lost, and we find instead a mass of fibrous tissue in which are embedded cheesy nodules. The cheesy nodules may soften and become fluid, or may calcify. Either one or both capsules may be involved. The early stages of this lesion are obscure, and it is difficult to know how far chronic inflammation, and how fiir tuberculosis is the efficient cause. Sometimes the medullary portion is replaced by a homogene- ous, grayish, structureless substance, which later becomes cheesy. Sometimes there are grayish nodules in the medullary sub- stance, which become cheesy and may fuse together. Sometimes there is a true suppurative inflammation with the formation of abscesses. Our knowledge of all these conditions is very imperfect. DEGENERATION. Fatty Degeneration of the cortical portion of the capsules is the rule in the adult. In children under five years of age, it is a pathological condition.

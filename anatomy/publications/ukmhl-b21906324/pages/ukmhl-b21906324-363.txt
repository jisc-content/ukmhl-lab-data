TUMOES. Ant classification of tumors which can be given, at the pre- sent time, is in great measure a provisional one. Our know- ledge of these growths is not yet sufficient to enable us to speak of them with certainty. There can be no doubt, however, of the proper method in which the study of tumors should be pur- sued in order to arrive at more complete results. We know that all new growths are composed of the same anatomical ele- ments as exist in the normal tissues, although their arrangement and mode of growth may be different. We know that no ana- tomical element, whether existing in a normal tissue or in .a pathological new growth, has any inherent malignant or benig- nant properties. We know that no grouping or arrangement of such indifterent elements can give them any specific properties. The only scientific plan, therefore, is to begin at the beginning; to find out, by patient study, what is the exact structure, the mode of growth, and the relationship to the surrounding tissues of every new growth which can be observed. To this we must add in each case the clinical history, the age and condition of the patient, the situation of the new growth, whether it recurs after extirpation, whether it grows slowly or rapidly, whether it invades neighboring tissues, whether metastatic tumors of the same nature are formed in other organs. By an accumulation of such facts as these, we arrive nearer and nearer to an exact knowledge of tumors. The number of existing observations is already sufficient to enable us, from the anatomy of a tumor, its situation, and the history of its growth, to give a prognosis with greater certainty than can be done in most diseases. To classify tumors, therefore, we merely group them accord- ing to our present knowledge of their anatomy, with the expec- tation that this grouping is to be much changed by future in- vestigations. We are especially hindered at the present time 23

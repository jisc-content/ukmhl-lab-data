POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 186 meningitis, acute miliary tuberculosis, acute articular rheu- matism, tjplius and typhoid fever, yellow-fever, cholera, the acute exanthemata, are all frequently accompanied by this change in the liver. Poisoning by phosphorus, by arsenic, and by antimony pro- duces this lesion in a marked degree. It will be found de- scribed more particularly under the head of poisons. Chronic pulmonary diseases and anaemia, from any cause, may produce the same lesion in the liver. THE HEPATIC AKTEKY. The hepatic artery, in rare cases, is the seat of aneurismal dilatations, which may attain a large size. Such aneurisms may displace the liver, produce intense pain, compress the bile- ducts so as to cause jaimdice, and usually rupture into the ab- domen or stomach. The diagnosis of this lesion is not often made during life. Embolism is not very common. It produces infarctions and abscesses. THE PORTAL VEIN. Thrombosis of the portal vein is a lesion frequently met with. It is occasionally produced by inflammation of the vein, but more frequently the phlebitis is produced by the thrombus. Thrombi of the portal vein may be produced by : 1. Weakening of the circulation from general debility. 2. Diseases of the liver which destroy or compress branches of the portal vein. Cirrhosis, chronic atrophy, cancer of the liver, and dilatation of the bile-ducts are the most frequent causes. The thrombus usually occupies both the branches and trunk of the portal vein. It may lill the vessel either partly or com- pletely. It adheres firmly to the wall of the vein, is firm and hard, or may be organized, and is of a grayish, blackish, or jaun- diced color. Fresh red coagula may be attached as prolonga- tions to the firmer clots. The vein is usually dilated, its walls are thickened, and may be calcareous.

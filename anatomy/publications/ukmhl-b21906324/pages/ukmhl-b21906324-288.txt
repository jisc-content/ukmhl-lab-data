THE BOKES. MALFORMATIONS. (1.) Defective Formation exhibits itself in the absence and imperfect development of the bones, as in acephalous mon- sters, in microcephalia, in absence or smallness of the extremi- ties. (2.) Excessive Formation is seen in the abnormal size or ab- normal number of the bones. (3.) The formation of Fissures is seen in cleft palate, hemi- crania, spina bifida, etc. (4.) The fusion of bones is seen in the extremities and cra- nium. (5.) The ossification of the epiphyses may take place abnor- mally early or abnormally late. CHANGES IN SIZE. (1.) Hypertrophy.—The bones are enlarged in all their dimen- sions, and retain their normal texture. This condition may ob- tain in all the bones, as with giants ; may be a congenital ab- normality of a single bone, especially of the fingers and toes ; may be an acquired condition, as in the bones of a liydrocephalic skull after the hydrocephalic process is at a stand-still. The bone may be increased in all its dimensions or simply elongated. Chronic inflammation of the bone or adjoining soft parts ; re- lease of a bone from physiological pressure, as in luxations; the effort to compensate for the destruction of an adjoining bone, may all produce hypertrophy. (2.) Hyperostosis.—The bones retain their normal length or breadth, but are increased in thickness. Tlie change may in- volve an entire bone, or only a circumscribed portion of it. In the latter case, the growth has more the character of a tumor.

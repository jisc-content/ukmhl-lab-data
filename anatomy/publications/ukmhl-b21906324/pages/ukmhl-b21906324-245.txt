Carcinoma is usually secondary to the same new growths in the uterus, but may be primary. It presents the same forms as are described in the uterus.

It grew from the anterior wall of the vagina, and first appeared like a small polypus. It was removed, but recurred in a few weeks. It then grew rapidly until it reached the size of a child's head. The patient died exhausted by the disease. The growth was composed of round, fusiform, and stellate cells im- bedded in a mucous basement substance, and of striated mus- cular fibres. THE UTERUS. CONGENITAL MALFOKMATION. The uterus, up to the end of the third month of intra-uterine life, consists of two large cornua, which, by the fusion of their lower ends, form the uterus. The uterus, tubes, and vagina may be entirely absent, with or without absence of the ovaries and external genitals. Or the < uterus alone, or the upper part of the vagina also, may be absent. The uterus may be only rudimentary, while the vagina is normal. It then appears as a flattened, solid body, with solid cornua. Or there are two cornua joined at their lower ex- tremities so as to form a small double uterus. Or the uterus is represented by a small sac, which may or may not communicate with the vagina. Or there is a very small uterus with thin, muscular walls and two large cornua. Only one of the cornua, which should form the uterus, may be developed, while the other is arrested in its growth. The uterus is then a long, cylindrical body, terminating above in

The growths look at first like warts, and are formed of hypertrophied papillse covered by thickened epidermis. They have a marked tendency to ulcerate, and may then be- come the starting-point of epithelial cancer. In some cases, the growth of epidermis becomes the principal feature in tlie process. Over one or more hypertrophied papil- IsB, an immense growth of epidermis takes place, so as to form projections over an inch in length, the so-called cornu cutaneum. Epithelioma occurs most frequently on the edge of the lower lip, but has been observed at many other parts of the mouth It begins either as an ulcerating papilloma, or as a small no- dule deep in the mucous membrane.

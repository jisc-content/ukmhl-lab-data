POST-ilORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 252 CHANGES IN POSITION. Ill adult life, tlie ovaries may descend as liernife into the in- guinal or crural canal, tlie foramen ovale, or the umbilicus. The position of the ovaries in tlie abdomen may be changed by the pressure of tumors, tlie traction of false membranes, etc. Kokitansky describes a twisting of the ovary on its axis, with twisting of the Fallopian tube around the ovarian ligament. It usually occurs in enlarged ovaries, and by the compression of the veins, leads to congestion and inflammation of the tube, ovary, and peritoneum. HEMORRHAGE. Every menstrual period is accompanied by the effusion of blood into a Graafian follicle. Normally, the amount of blood is small, becomes solid, is decolorized, and then gradually ab- sorbed. Sometimes the effusion of blood is much greater ; the follicle filled with blood is as large as a pigeon's egg. The blood may remain in the follicle and be absorbed, or it may rupture it and escape into the peritoneal cavity. Death may ensue from the hsemorrhage, or the blood may collect in Dou- glas's cul de sac, and be inclosed in fiilse membranes. Ilte- morrhages also occur in follicles, Avhicli have become cystic. INFLAmiATION. Inflammation of the ovaries occurs most frequently in the puerperal condition, either as part of a general peritonitis, or as a primary aft'ection. Witli puerperal peritonitis, botli ovaries are usually inflamed ; they are swollen, congested, soft, infiltrated with serum or pus, or gangrenous. The inflammation may attack principally the capsule, the stroma, or the follicles. Inflammation of the cap- sule results in adhesions and collections of pus, shut in by false membranes; of the stroma, in abscesses and fibrous indu- ration; of the follicles, in their containing purulent serum. If the inflammation of the ovary is the primary lesion, it is usual- ly conflned to one organ. The stroma of the ovary is infiltrated with serum and pus, and may contain abscesses of large size.

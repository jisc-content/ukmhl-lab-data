Addison's disease. 327 Very rarely, there may be haemorrliage between the perios- teum and bone, and in the bone itself, producing softening and destruction of the bone, and separation of the epiphyses. The sternal ends of the ribs are the most frequent seat of this change. The pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum may be the seat of ecchymoses, or contain large haemorrhages in their cavities, or be coated with fibrinous exudation. The lungs may be congested, oedematoiis, or the seat of lobu- lar pneumonia. The mucous membrane of the air-passages usually contains ecchymoses. The spleen is swollen, soft, and may contain infarctions. The mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines is swollen, congested, contains haemoi'rhages, exhibits small hse- morrhagic ulcers, and may be coated with blood. The kidneys may appear normal, or may be in various stages of Bright's Disease. ADDISON'S DISEASE. Under this name is usually understood a disease characterized by a dark-colored or bronzed skin, by disease of the supra-renal capsules, and by a peculiar group of symptoms. The symp- toms are: A change in the mental condition; great ansemia, with increase of the white-blood globules, but without emacia- tion ; frequent and protracted syncope ; great prostration ; pains in the back and epigastrium ; dyspepsia and vomiting; diar- rhoea; sometimes convulsions, neuralgia, and paraplegia; ty- phoid symptoms and death. The pigmentation of the skin is the symptom which has prin- cipally excited attention. The change in color usually begins, and becomes most intense in those parts of the skin which are not covered by the clothing. The rest of the skin afterward changes color, but not uniformly ; for white patches are often left. The color is at first a light yellow or brown ; this becomes darker until it is a dark greenish brown, grayish or blackish brown. There may be black spots on the mucous membrane of the lips and mouth.

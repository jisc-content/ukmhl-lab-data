342 POST-MOETEM EXAMINATIONS. â€¢ The larynx is very frequently acted on by the acid. There are yellow eschars, congestion and swelling of the mucous membrane, sometimes oedema of the glottis. The trachea may be inflamed, and the lungs congested. If the patient survives the first efiects of the poison, the lesions of chronic inflammation, cicatrization and contraction are found at a later period. The acid nitrate of mercury, if taken in a concentrated form into the stomach, produces the same lesions as nitric acid. HYDEO-CHLOEIC ACID. The lesions are much the same' as those produced by nitric and sulphuric acids. The eschars are of a whiter color, and it is more common to find false membranes on the inflamed sur- faces. OXALIC ACID. The dose of this poison which may destroy life is variable. Sixty grains may prove fatal, an ounce may not cause death. The same amount of poison does not always cause death at the same period. Three minutes and twenty-three days are the extremes; an hour is the usual time. The mucous mem- brane of the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus is white, or coated with brown vomit from the stomach. The stomach contains a dark brown, mucous fluid. The mucous membrane is pale, softened, brittle, and looking as if it had been boiled in water. Sometimes the mucous membrane is red and congested, some- times it is blackened and gangrenous. If life is prolonged, the whitened condition of the mucous membrane is succeeded by congestion and inflammation. The duodenum may be inflamed. In some cases of death from this poison, there are no well marked lesions. Oxalate of potash produces the same lesions as oxalic acid. TARTARIC ACID. This acid is seldom used as a poison. In large doses, it may prove fatal.

DEATH FKOM POISONING. 341 The skin of the face about the month may be blackened and charred by the acid. The month and pharynx are of a grayish or blackish color, while the deeper tissnes are reddened. Sometimes these regions escape the action of the poison. The larynx, trachea, and Inngs are sometimes acted on, soft- ened and blackened by the accidental passage of the acid into them. This may even take place when the acid does not pass into the oesophagus. The oesophagns seldom escapes. It is grayish or blackish co- lored, softened, and the mncons membrane comes off in shreds. If life is pi'olonged, cicatrices and strictures are formed. The stomach is coated on its internal surface with a black, sticky layer beneath which the mucous membrane is reddened. Sometimes perforation takes place, and the acid blackens and softens the adjoining viscera. In protracted cases, cicatrices are formed, and the organ is contracted. If the poison is dilute, there may be only the lesions of chronic gastritis. The blood is thickened, syrupy, acid, and may form thrombi in the vessels. The body may be partially preserved from decomjjosition. Fatty degeneration of the renal epithelium is mentioned b}^ some authors. Sulphate of Indigo produces the same lesions as sulphuric acid. It also stains the tissues of a dark blue color. NITEIO ACID. The surface of the mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus is covered with yellow eschars wherever the acid has touched it. Beneath and around the eschars the tissues are congested and red. The poison may be introduced into the oesophagus without acting on the mouth. The stomach con- tains a viscous, sanguinolent, yellow or greenish fluid. The mucous membrane is congested, red, swollen, and softened, ecchymotic. It is rarely perforated. The duodenum may be inflamed, and the inflammation ex- tend to its peritoneal coat. The rest of the intestines usually escapes from the action of the acid.

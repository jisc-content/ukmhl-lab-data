223 THE URINARY BLADDER. mucous membrane becomes brown, or slate-colored, its swellinc; is more marked, and may take the form of tufts or polypi. The submucous and muscular coats are hypertrophied. The mucous membrane may be incrusted with the salts of the de- composed urine. Ulcerations take place which gradually per- forate all the coats of the bladder and produce abscesses in the surrounding connective tissue. These abscesses may finally open into the vagina, intestines, or through the skin. In other cases, the muscular coat is paralyzed, and the bladder dilated. The mucous membrane is discolored, incrusted with salts, gangrenous. The gangrene may extend to all the coats, and the urine escape into the abdominal cavity. In all cases the inflammation may extend to the ureters and kidneys. Croupous and Diphtheritic Inflammalion may accompany the same inflammation of the vagina; occur with scarlet fever, typhus fever, etc., with stone in the bladder and decomposing urine, with carcinoma; and are rarely an idiopathic disease. The entire mucous membrane or only patches of it are in- volved. It is intensely congested, or of a grayish color, covered and infiltrated with fibrine and pus, portions of it gangrenous. Sometimes entire fibrinous casts of the bladder are discharged by the urethra ; very rarely the mucous membrane itself is de- tached and cast ofi\ NEW GEOWTHS. Fibroma^ in the form of circumscribed nodules in the sub- mucous tissue, is described by Eokitansky as of very rare occurrence. Fibromapapillare occurs in the form of a mass of branching tufts, covered with cylindrical epithelium. The muscular coat of the bladder is often hypertrophied at the same time. The growth is most frequent in young persons, and even occurs in children. Fibroma polyposum occurs in the form of a circumscribed hypertrophy of the mucous membrane, usually near the neck of the bladder. It is most frequent in childhood. Fibro-Adenoma is found at the neck of the bladder, in the sub-

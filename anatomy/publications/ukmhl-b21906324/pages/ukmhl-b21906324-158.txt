148 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. DEGENEEATIOJ^S. Calcification of the mucous membrane is sometimes found as a metastatic deposit witli extensive disease of the bones. The salts of lime are deposited in a granular form in the connective tissue between the glandular follicles, and more rarely in the muscular coat. Waxy Degeneration sometimes invades the stomach. It at- tacks the vessels of the mucous membrane, and more rarely the cells of the glandular follicles. The mucous membrane appears thin and glistening. THE INTESTINES. MALFORMATIONS, Diverticula of the intestines occur in several different ways : (1.) The abdominal walls are cleft asunder at the navel. The ileum opens through this cleft by a narrow aperture in its wall. The lower portions of the ileum and the colon are small or en- tirely closed. (2.) There is an opening in the abdominal wall as before, but there is not a direct opening into the ileum. There is a long diverticulum of the ileum, with an open end projecting into the opening in the abdominal wall. (3.) The abdominal wall is closed. There is a diverticulum of the ileum connected with the navel by a solid cord. (4.) There is an unattached diverticulum of the intestine. This is much the most common form. The diverticula occur only in the lower part of the ileum. They usually spring from the convex surface of the intestine, more rarely from its attached border. In the latter case, they are joined to the mesentery by a fold of peritoneum. Tlie diverticulum forms a ])0uch, 1-6 inches long, of about the same diameter as tlie in- testine, smallest at its free extremity. Such diverticula never interfere with tlie fimctions of the "intestines. They sometimes form part of a hernia. If they re- main attached by a fibrous cord to tlie navel, this cord may be the cause of incarceration of a portion of the intestines.

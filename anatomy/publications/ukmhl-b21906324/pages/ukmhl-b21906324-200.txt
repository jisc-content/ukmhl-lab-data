190 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. CALCIFICATION OF THE POKTAL VEIN. Chronic endophlebitis may occur with the production of athe- romatous degeneration and calcification of the portal vein and its branches. It affects separate patches of the wall, or the en- tire wall for a considerable distance. This lesion of the vein may produce thrombosis. THE HEPATIC VEINS. The hepatic veins are found to present the same lesions as the portal veins, but much less frequentl}^ Dilatation of these veins is produced by any obstruction to the passage of the venous blood into the heart. Chronic phlebitis and hard thrombi are produced by perihe- patitis. The wall of the vein is thickened ; gelatinous deposits or valvular projections on the inner surface of the vein may narrow or obliterate it. There may be apoplexies in the tissue of the liver. Soft thrombi and suppurative inflammation of the branches of the hepatic vein are sometimes produced by abscesses in the liver. NEW GROWTHS OF THE LIVER. Fibroma.—A single case of a fibrous tumor is described by Luschka, as occurring in the liver of a young child. Chondroma in the liver is of rare occurrence. It is secondary to chondroma in other regions of the body. Angioma.—Small cavernous tumors are of frequent occur- rence in the liver. They form irregularl3'-shaped, sharply-de- fined, reddish black spots in the liver-tissue, from the size of an acinus up to that of a man's fist. They are composed of a mesh-work, formed of connective tissue and smooth muscle ; the cavities of this mesh-work are lined with epithelium, resembling that of the veins, contain venous blood, and can be injected from the portal vein and the hepatic artery. According to Vir- chow, the tumor is formed by the dilatation of all the veins of one or more liver acini. Rindfleisch, on the other hand, holds

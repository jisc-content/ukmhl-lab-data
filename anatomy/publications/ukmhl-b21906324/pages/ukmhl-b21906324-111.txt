101 THE HEART. liypertrophy of the right ventricle, and secondarily of the right auricle and left ventricle. (4.) Any canse, whether muscular or nervous, which increases the rapidity and force of the heart's contractions, may produce hypertrophy. (5.) Dilatation of the ventricles from any cause is frequently followed by hypertrophy. (6.) Pericarditis may produce hypertrophy by inducing soft- ening and dilatation of the ventricles, or by leaving adhesions which obstruct the heart's action. Finally, for some cases of hypertrophy no satisfactory cause can be found. DILATATION. Dilatation may be active—combined with hypertrophy ; sim pie—the heart-walls retaining their normal thickness ; or pas- sive—with thinning of the walls. Either one or all of the heart cavities may be dilated. The auricles are most frequently affected ; next, the right ventricle ; least often, the left ventricle. . Active dilatation has already been described under the head of hypertrophy. In simple dilatation, the shape of the heart is changed accord- ing to the cavities afiected. Dilatation of the right ventricle increases the breadth, dilatation of the left ventricle, the length of the heart. The walls of the heart are of normal thickness; the muscular tissue is flabby ; the muscular fibres are normal, or fatty, or waxy. Passive dilatation is produced by : (1.) Changes in the valves. Mitral or aortic stenosis, or in- sufiiciency, may produce dilatation of the auricles and right ventricle. Pulmonary stenosis, or insufficiency, may produce dilatation of the right auricle and right ventricle. Aortic in- sufficiency, with or without stenosis, or mitral insufficiency, may produce dilatation of the left ventricle. Dilatations from these causes are often succeeded and compensated for by hypertrophy of the heart's walls. (2.) Changes in the muscular tissue of the heart-walls.

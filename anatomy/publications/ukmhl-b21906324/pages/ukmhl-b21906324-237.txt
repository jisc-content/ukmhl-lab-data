227 THE UEETHHA. or there may be infiltration of urine, or the formation of fis- tulfe. Ruptures of tlie urethra are produced by severe contusions and by fracture of the pelvic bones. Extravasations of blood and urine, and gangrenous inflammation of the surrounding soft parts, are the ordinary results. Ulceration and perforation of the urethra lead to the forma- tion of fistulse, which open in various directions through the skin. INFLAMMATION. Catarrhal Urethritis is most frequently due to infection from gonorrhoea, but is also produced by a variety of causes. In its acute form, it involves either a portion or the whole of the ure- thra. The mucous membrane is red, swollen, and covered with muco-pus. The inflammation may extend to the fibrous wall of the urethra, the corpora spongiosa, and cavernosa. This may result in the formation of new connective tissue, or of abscesses, especially near the fossa navicularis. The inflammation may also extend to the bladder, the glands of Cowper, the prostate, the spermatic cord, and the testicles. The inguinal glands also may be swollen and inflamed, and the lymphatic vessels on the dorsum of the penis may be involved in the same process. Clironic inflammation of the urethra may exist for a long time without producing any lesions. In other cases it leads to ulceration, to fibrous induration of the wall of the canal, to in- duration and swelling of the mucous follicles ; to polypoid thick- enings of the mucous membrane. Croupous Inflammation is sometimes seen in children. Fi- brinous casts of a small or large portion of the canal ai'e formed. SijphilitiG Ulcers may be situated at the meatus, or as far back as the fossa navicularis. They are apt to produce stric- tures. NEW GROWTHS. Fibroma Papillare, in the form of little polypoid excrescen- ces of the mucous membrane, sometimes occurs. They are the result of chronic inflammation, and are confined to a small or large portion of the wall of the urethra.

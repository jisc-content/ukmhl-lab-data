THE SPLEEN. 199 a dark-red color. The exact nature of this enlargement is not known. If the patient recovers, the organ returns to its normal size. A more chronic and persistent enlargement of the spleen is found with intermittent fever, heart-disease, leucaemia, with chronic diseases, and without known cause. The spleen is then t, simply increased in size, without other change from its normal appearance; or the fibrous stroma is disproportionately in- creased ; or there is an unusual hypersemia. Atrophy of the spleen occurs as a senile change. "We also freqiiently find it at the autopsy, without any cause to account for it. CHANGES IN POSITION. The spleen may be pressed downward by any increase in the contents of the thorax. It may be fastened by adhesions to the concave surface of the diaphragm, so that its long axis is nearly horizontal, instead of vertical. It may be displaced by changes in the contents of the abdominal cavity. If the organ is in- creased in size, it frequently becomes tilted, so that its lower border reaches the right iliac region. If the ligaments of the spleen are too long congenitally, or if they are lengthened by traction, and if the organ is at the same time increased in weight, it may become very movable. It sinks downward, with its hilus turned upward ; or it may be rotated on its axis. It may, after a time, cause atrophy; or it may compress the duodenum. EUPTUEE. The spleen may be ruptured by severe blows or falls. Fatal haemorrhage usually ensues, but sometimes the patient recovers. Rupture has also been observed in a few cases of typhoid fe- A'er, remittent and relapsing fever, and of cholera. INFLAMMATION. It is a very frequent occurrence to find the capsule of the spleen thickened and adherent to the neighboring viscera. For the most part, the cause of these changes cannot be ascertained.

POST-MORTElt EXAMINATIONS. 172 pressed, its axis is carried downward, and the entire organ push- ed toward the median line. The liver may then fill the upper lialf of the abdominal cavity. When the contents of the thorax are increased, the liver is pushed downward. In pulmonary emphysema, the liver may be depressed from one to one and a half intercostal spaces. In pleurisy, empyema, and hydropneumothorax of the right side, the liver is pushed downward and dislocated, so that its convex surface is in apposition with the abdominal wall. When the eflfusion is in the left pleural cavity, the liver is pushed toward the right side, and slightly depressed. Very great serous effusion in the pericardium may depress the liver, especially the left lobe. Intra-thoracic tumors depress the liver, according to their situation. When there is fluid or a new growth in the abdomen, or gas in the intestines, the liver is pushed directly upward, without any change in its axis. Structural changes in the liver increase or diminish its size, and cause an increase or diminution in its thickness. There have been a very small number (3) of cases reported of dislocated and movable liver. They all occurred in women who had borne children. The diagnosis was made during life, and no post-mortem examination of the cases was made. The transverse colon may become fixed above the liver, so as to push it backward, downward, and to the right. INJUEIES. Wounds of the liver produce haemorrhage and inflammation. They are usually fatal; but the patient may recover, even after the destruction of a considerable portion of the organ. Rupture of the liver is produced by severe contusions and falls ; it results in large hajmorrhages, and is very fatal. IIYPER.EMIA. Ilyperaemia of the liver is either an active or a passive pro- cess. In health, the amount of blood in the liver varies at different

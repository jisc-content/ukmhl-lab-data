335 DEATH FROM DROWNING. eflected by a cord or cloth drawn around the neck, the latter will bear a mark nearly encircling it. In both cases, the mark may be one or two lines deep, or very superficial. It corresponds in width to the cord which has pro- duced it.

In cases of strangulation by the fingers, the impressions left by them present the same appearances, but correspond in shape to the fingers. Exactly the same appearances are seen in bodies which have been hung or strangled soon after death. Internal Examination.

In examining the bodies of persons who have been drowned, it is necessary to bear in mind a number of questions which may arise: Whether the person dame into the water alive or dead ; how long a time has elapsed since death; whether the

THE PERITONEUM. 163 Pentadomum denticulatum occurs in the submucous tissue of the small intestine in an encapsuled condition. Cysticereus cellulosw has been seen in a few cases on the mu- cous membrane. Tcenia solium, Tcenia mediocanellata, and Bothriocepludus lotus, are all found in the small intestine. THE PERITONEUM. MALFORMATIONS. Arrest of development in the peritoneal sac occurs in the shape of fissures in the mesial line, or external to it; in the case of the diaphragm being absent, of a fusion with the pleura ; as defective development of the mesentery, the omentum, and the other folds of the peritoneum. Excess of development occurs in the shape of unusual length of the mesentery, the omentum, and the other fold of the peri- toneum'; or of supernumerary folds and peritoneal pouches. These are chiefly found in the hypogastric, and, more especially, in the iliac and inguinal regions, and near the fundus vesicaj. There is access to these sacs by a well-defined fissure or ring, which is frequently surrounded by a tendinous band lying in the duplicature. They may give rise to internal incarceration of the intestines. (Rokitansky.) HYPEREMIA AND H^MOEEHAGE. Congestion of the peritoneum is general or partial. It is caused by obstructions to the venous circulation in the portal vein and vena cava, and by inflammation. It produces serous eff'usions in the peritoneal cavity, thickening of the peritoneum, small extravasations, and consequent pigmentation of the peri- toneum. Extravasations in and beneath the peritoneum'Vire found with purpura, scurvy, after contusions, parturition, etc. Hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity is produced by wounds, contusions, rupture of the abdominal viscera, and of aneurisms.

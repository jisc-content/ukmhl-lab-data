POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 272 and tlie skin, and surrounding the gland, may be the seat of the inflainniation. If the connective tissue-stroma of the ffland is the seat of inflammation, usually only circumscribed nodules are aflfected. The inflammation may resolve, or goes on to suppuration. The abscesses usually open through the skin and soon cicatrize. Sometimes, however, the abscesses become chronic, with induration and formation of granulation tissue about them. Rarely, they perforate into the pleiu-al cavity. In new-born children, we sometimes find a painful swelling and redness of one or both breasts, with a secretion of thin milk. This inflammation usually subsides in a few days, but may go on to suppuration. At the time of puberty, a subacute form of mastitis may occur in both sexes. The gland is somewhat swollen, hard, and painful; rarely, there is a small secretion of milk. In women, after puberty, subacute mastitis sometimes occurs unconnected with lactation. There are circumscribed, indu- rated nodules in the gland, which may resolve without marked symptoms, or may slowly suppurate. Chronic inflammation and the formation of cold abscesses are rare. They occur in married and unmarried women after puberty. We find circumscribed, hard nodules in the breast, which may remain unchanged for years. Or they may break down slowly into abscesses, containing a thin pus with cheesy fragments. Several such abscesses may communicate by sinu- ses. They may become surrounded by a thick wall of fibrous tissue. H.-EMORRHAGE. In young women, who suff"er from amenorrlioea and dysme- norrhoja, small hsemorrhages sometimes occur on and in the mamma, at the time of the menses. Contusions of the breast may produce extravasations of blood in the connective tissue. The blood may be afterward ab- sorbed, or may remain as a hard mass surrounded by dense connective tissue.

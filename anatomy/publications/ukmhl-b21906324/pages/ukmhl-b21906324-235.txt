THE URETHRA. 225 fibrous and muscular stroma, forming cavities filled with epithelial cells. The tumors were softer, and the muscular tissue more abundant, than in the case described by Vircliow. PAKASrrES. Distoma hmmatobium has been observed ia the vessels of the mucous membraneâ€”only in Egypt. Sarcina has been found with chronic cystitis. Eustrongylus, echinococcus, and ascarides sometimes find their way into the bladder from other organs. Every variety of foreign body may be introduced into and remain in the bladder. If their stay is long, they become in- crusted with the urinary salts. THE URETHRA. CONGENITAL MALFOKMATIONS. Some of the malformations of the urethra are described with those of the penis. The urethra may be impervious, or may open at the root of the penis. More commonly there is partial obliteration or stricture of some part of the canal. The entire urethra may be dilated into a sac full of urine. There may be a canal on the dorsum of the penis, formed by the fusion of the spermatic cords, and opening in the glans above the urethra. There may be two or more openings of the urethra. The canal may be dislocated so as to open in the inguinal re- gion. CHANGES IN SIZE AND POSniON. Dilatation of the urethra is produced by strictures, or by cal- clili which become fixed in it. The dilatations are fusiform or sacculated in shape, and may reach the size of an orange and over. Strictures of the urethra are produced by inflammation of its walls. 15

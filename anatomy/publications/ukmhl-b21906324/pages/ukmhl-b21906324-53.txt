THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. THE MEMBRANES OF THE BRAIN. THE DURA MATER. When the Calvarium is removed, the Dura Mater is brought into view. It will be found somewhat adherent to the bone ; sometimes very adherent, as a senile change, or as the result of chronic inflammation. At the vertex the Dura Mater is often thinned or even perforated by the pacchyonian bodies, which may also produce indentations in the internal surface of the cal- varium. Ilmnorrhages.â€”These occur in the form of clots between the Dura Mater and skull, or, more rarely, in the substance of the membrane. They are usually produced by direct violence ap- plied to the skull, and correspond in situation to the external injury. In children, however, clots are found between the dura mater and parietal bones, in connection with cephalhfema- toma of the pericranium. Severe injuries and penetrating wounds of the skull may also lacerate or penetrate the dura mater. In rare cases the membrane has been found ruptured by the pressure of fluid in hydrocephalus. Thrombosis of the sinuses of the dm*a mater is not uncommon. The thrombi ai'e yellow and Arm, or soft, broken down, and puriform. They are produced by changes in the blood, by pul- monary disease, by inflammation of the skin of the face and scalp, with thrombosis of the veins, by inflammation and fracture of the cranial bones, by meningitis, by otitis, and occur without known cause.

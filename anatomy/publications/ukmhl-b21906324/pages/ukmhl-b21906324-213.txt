THE PANCREAS. 203 fined to the pancreas, or may spread to the duodenum, the stomach, or the neighboring lymphatic glands. As a secondary growth, carcinoma usually invades tne pan- creas by continuous infection from the duodenum, stomach, or lymphatic glands. THE PANCKEATIC DUCTS. Concretions of carbonate and phosphate of lime are frequently found in the pancreatic ducts. They are usually multiple, small, whitish, of rough and irregular shape. Sometimes, how- ever, they reach a diameter of more than an inch. Besides these free concretions, the walls of the ducts are sometimes incrusted with salts of lime. Such concretions may produce dilatation of the pancreatic ducts and large cysts, or, more rarely, abscesses. Foreign Bodies.â€”Gall-stones sometimes find their way into the pancreatic duct. Ascarides have been found in the ducts in a considerable number of cases. Dilatation of the pancreatic ducts, and the formation of cysts, take place in several diiFerent ways. (1.) The entire duct may undergo a uniform, cylindrical di- latation. "With this cylindrical dilatation we sometimes find associated small sacculi. (2.) There may be sacculated dilatations at some point in the ducts. These dilatations form cysts of large size, as large even as a child's head. Their walls frequently become atheromatous and calcified. These cysts often become filled with blood, and may then be mistaken for aneurisms. (3.) The small branches of the pancreatic duct may be di- lated so as to form a number of small cysts. These cysts are filled with serum, mucus, pus, or a thick cheesy material. THE SUPRARENAL CAPSULES. MALFORMATIONS. In anencephalous and other monsters the capsules may be entirely absent or much atrophied. Sometimes, in well-formed adults, the organs cannot be discovered.

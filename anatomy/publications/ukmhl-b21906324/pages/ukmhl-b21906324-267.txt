257 THE FALLOPIAN" TUBES. INFLAMMATION. Catarrhal Inflammation of the mucous membrane of the Fallopian tubes is of common occurrence. It is connected with endometritis, with the puerperal condition, or is an idiopathic affection. Usually both tubes are involved, the mucous mem- brane is swollen, and there is a production of mucus and pus in ^ the tubes. The inflammation may subside without leaving any lesions, but more' frequently results in peritoneal adhesions, obliteration of the tubes, dilatation, and abscesses. Dilatation of the tubes is usually produced by obstruction or obliteration of their uterine extremities. The dilatation is generally moderate, converting the tube into a tortuous saccu- lated canal, containing mucus or serum mixed with pus or blood. More rarely, the dilatation is excessive and cysts are formed containing several pounds of fluid, and which may be mistaken for ovarian cysts. Dr. Peaslee has reported a case in which death ensued from haemorrhage into the cavity of such a di- lated tube. In some cases, the fluid in the dilated tubes is entirely puru- lent, forming abscesses in the tubes. These abscesses may rup- ture into the peritoneal cavity, or the pus may escape into a cavity shut in by adhesions, or may perforate into the intes- tines. Suppurative Inflammation of the tubes is found in connec- tion with puerperal peritonitis and metritis. The tubes are swollen, intensely congested and pus exudes from their abdo- minal ends. It is often difficult to determine whether the peri- tonitis or salpingitis is the primary lesion. new' growths. Cysts of small size are often found on the tubes and broad ligaments. They are formed by dilatation of the follicles of the foetal organs :â€”the WoMan Body, and the accessory ovary. Besides these, serous and colloid cysts, sometimes of large size, are found which seem to be true new growths. Kiwisch says that cysts are also found between the folds of peritoneum which accompany the round ligaments. 17

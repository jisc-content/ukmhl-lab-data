POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 126 lar coat of the vein. Tlie corresponding portion of the Inmen of the vein was dilated. The growth appeared like a globular dilatation of the vein, with great hypertrophy of the muscular coat. Myo Sarcoma has been observed in one case. The tumor was as large as a man's fist, situated in the cavity of the dilated vena cava, extending from the liver to below the renal veins. The growth had invaded the adjoining portion of liver, and there were secondary growths in the lymphatic glands. The tumor consisted of connective tissue, smooth muscle, fusifoi'm cells, and myeloplaxes. Carcinoma of the surroimding parts may perforate the wall of a vein, and grow in its cavity, so as to form a thrombotic mass of considerable size. Cases have been reported in which the new growth was confined to the cavity of the liver veins, and not found in any other part of the body. PAEASITES. EcMnococGus is sometimes found in the veins, either develop- ed there, or having perforated from the adjoining tissues. Distoma hepaticxim is foxmd in the veins of the liver. Distoma hwmatolium has been found in the portal vein and its branches, principally in Egyptians. THE ALIMENTAKY CANAL. THE MOUTH. MALFORMATIONS.

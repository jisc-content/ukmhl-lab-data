THE LIVER. 175 nutmeg color, or of a uniform dark red. Tlie veins at tlie cen- tres of tlie acini are dilated; the liver-cells between tliem are atrophied, pigmented, and diminished in number. The periphe- ral cells are normal or fatty. There is a production of lym- phoid cells at the centres of the acini. Atroj^hy of the liver is also produced by obliteration or ste- nosis of the portal vein and its branches, by obstruction of the capillaries by pigment, and by obliteration of the capillaries. Permanent obstruction of the- hepatic or common bile duct may produce atrophy. The biliary ducts throughout the liver are dilated, the liver is stained at first yellow and afterward green, the consistence is soft, the size of the organ is much di- minished, and the liver-cells are pigmented, fatty, and broken down. Chronic perihepatitis, with great thickening of the entire capsule of the liver, sometimes produces marked atrophy with the symptoms of cirrhosis. â–  iiypketropiiy; Simple hypertrophy of the liver is to be diagnosticated with great caution. It is found with leucsemia, diabetes, phthisis, and cardiac disease, in malarious districts, and without known cause. The liver is inc reasedin size, the acini are larger than normal, the liver-cells are increased in size or number, the blood-vessels are also large. lI.EMOKEnAGE. Extravasations of blood in the hepatic tissue, or, more fre- quently, beneath its capsule, are found in new-born children after tedious or forcible labors, and with atalectasis of the lungs. The blood may burst through the capsule, and be found in the peritoneal cavity. In adults, such extravasations are rare. They are seen in the malignant, malarious fevers, especially in tropical countries ; in scurvy and purpura; and in consequence of external vio- lence. Tliere are also a few cixrious cases recorded of such sud- den hsemorrhages in Avhich no cause was discovered. The ex- travasations of blood are beneath the capsule, or circumscribed

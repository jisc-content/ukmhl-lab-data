112 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. DEGENERATIONS. Fatty Degeneration affects the heart in two waj-s, as an in- crease of the siibpericardial fat, and as a change in the mnscn- lar fibres. The increase of the siibpericardial fat may be attended with atrophy of the mnscular tissue, or it may not. It accompanies an increase of adipose tissue tliroughout other regions of the body. Fatty degeneration of the muscular fibres produces fine granules in them, which may be so numerous as to apparently fill the sarcolemma. These granules appear to be at first of an albuminous, later of a fatty nature. The afiected muscle ap- pears yellow, soft, and friable. The heai-t-wall may retain its normal thickness, or it may be much atrophied. The greater part of the heart may undergo this change, or only small cir- cumscribed portions, or only the superficial layers. The de- generation may lead to rupture of the heart, or to death from the inability of the heart to fulfil its functions. Phosphorus poisoning, typhus and severe fevers, pericarditis and exhausting diseases are found as causes for this condition, but it may occur in apparently healthy individuals. Waxy or Amyloid Degeneration is found in connection witli the same change in the other viscera, and is due to the same causes. The muscular fibres are the seat of the degeneration. Mucous Degeneration of the siibpericardial fat is found in persons much emaciated by chronic disease. The fat is chang- ed into a translucent, gelatinous substance, composed of a homogeneous basement substance, eoagulable by alcohol and acids, and of connective tissue-cells and compound granular corpuscles. NEW GROWTHS. Fibroma is sometimes seen in the form of small nodules growing in the heart-wall, or projecting under the endocardium or pericardium. Lljfoma is very rare in the form of a circumscribed tumor,

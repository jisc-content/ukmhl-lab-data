POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 98 THE HEART. CONGENITxVL JIALFOEMATIONS. The malformations of the heart are usually closely connected with malformations of the aorta and pulmonary artery. They depend on arrest of, or abnormal development; on endocar- ditis, myocarditis, thrombosis, or mechanical causes. I. The common arterial trunk is only partially, or not at all, separated into aorta and pulmonary artery. The divisions be- tween the heart cavities are at the same time defective. (1.) There is one ventricle and no auricle. (2.) There is one ventricle and one amicle. (3.) There is one ventricle and two aui'icles ; the aorta is alone or incompletely separated from the pulmonary artery. II. The trunk of the pulmonary artery, or of the aorta, is stenosed or obliterated, and from the obstruction to the current of blood the development of the septa, between the heart cavities, is prevented. (1.) The aorta, at its origin or in the ascending portion of the arch, is stenosed or closed. The pulmonary artery gives off the descending aorta, and supplies the carotids and subclavians. The foramen oval remains open, or there is no septum be- tween the auricles. The ventricular septum is also usually defective. The right ventricle is hypertrophied. (2.) The piilmonary artery is stenosed or closed. Its branches are supplied by the aorta, through the ductus arteriosus. The ventricular septum is defective, the foramen ovale is ojjen, or tlie auricular septum defective. III. The malformation affects the aorta and pulmonary artery after they are more fully developed. (1.) There is stenosis of the aorta between the left subclavian and ductus arteriosus, or just at the opening of the ductus arte- riosus. The descending aorta is then a continuation of the pulmonary artery. (2.) The aorta gives off all its branches from the arch, but the descending aorta is a continuation of the pulmonary artery, or the carotids may spring from the aorta, the subclavians from the pulmonary artery.

The congenital cystic kidney is a very striking pathological condition. The kidneys are converted into a mass of number- less cysts, so large as to nearly fill the abdominal cavity, and often to seriously hinder the birth of the child. The cysts are of all sizes, separated by fibrous septa, or by compressed kidney tissue. They contain a clear, yellow, acid fluid holding in solution the urinary salts. In other cases, the fluid is turbid and brown, and contains blood, uric acid crystals, or cholesterine. The cysts are lined with a simple layer of flat, polygonal epithelium. The cysts are formed by a dilata- tion of the kidney tubules, and of the capsules of the Mal- pighian tufts. The dilatation may be produced by a change in the papillfB, obliterating the tubes there ; or by stenosis of the pelvis, ureters, bladder, or ui'ethra. This condition is usually associated with other malformations, hydrocephalus, club- foot, etc. In extra-uterine life, we find cysts in kidneys which are otherwise normal, and in those Avhich are the seat of chronic diff'use nephritis. In the normal kidney we find one or a few cysts, from the size of a pin's head to that of a pigeon's egg. They are situated in the cortex, and may project outward. They contain clear serum, or a viscid, colloid substance, or cholesterine. The walls of the cysts are smooth, or incomplete septa project in- ward. There is no exact knowledge of the way in which these cysts are formed, although it is probable that they are produced by the dilatation of the kidney tubules. They do not give rise to any changes in the kidney tissue, nor to any clinical symptoms. In kidneys which are the seat of chronic diffuse nephritis it is not infrequent to find cysts. The cysts are numerous, scat-

136 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. The growth begins in the submucous tissue. "We then find a liard, prominent ring encircling the oesophagus and producing a greater or less degree of stenosis; after a time, the mucous mem- brane and the new growth ulcerate,, and instead of the stenosis there is a cavity with ragged walls. Or, the mucous membrane ulcerates at an early stage of the disease, and the growth of the epithelioma does not exceed its destruction by ulceration. Then we find an ulcer encircling the oesophagus, of which the malignant character can be easily overlooked. More rarely the mucous membrane xilcerates and the pseudoplasm grows rapidly and projects in fungous masses into the cavity of the oesophagus. If tlie new growth.involves the entire thickness of the oeso- phageal wall, it may go on to invade the neighboring j^arts and may perforate the trachea, the bronchi, the lungs, the aorta, the pulmonary artery, or the vertebrje. Secondary and metas- tatic tumors are very rare. Fibroma occurs in thephai'ynx in the form of small polypoid tumors. These little polypi are covered with nuicous mem- brane, while their interior is made up of a loose, vascular fibro- cellular tissue. Besides these, large polypoid tumors make their appearance in the pharynx and posterior nares, which grow from the peri- osteum of the bones of the base of the skull and of the upper cervical vertebrae. These tumors push the mucous membrane before tliem, often reach a large size, and may prove fatal. Sarcomata also grow from the periosteum of the neighbor- ing bones and project into the pharynx. Lipoma is sometimes found in the wall of the oesophagus, forming small nodules in the submucous tissue. Cysts are sometimes formed in the walls of the pharynx and oesophagus by dilatation of the mucous glands. Myoma occurs in the form of hard, rounded tumors growing from the muscular coat. The tumors iisually project inward, and sometimes even have a i)olypoid shape.

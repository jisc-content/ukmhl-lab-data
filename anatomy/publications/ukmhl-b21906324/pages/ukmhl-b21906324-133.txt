123 THE VEENS. THE VEINS. DILATATION. Dilatation of the Veins, or Plilebectasia, presents itself under a variety of forms. (1.) Simple Dilatation. The vein is uniformly dilated in a cylindrical or fusiform shape; its length is not increased; its Avails are of normal thickness, or thinned; the valves increase in size, or are insufficient, or atrophy, or are torn. (2.) Cirsoid Dilatation. The vein is imiformly cylindrically dilated, but is also increased in length, so that it assumes a very tortuous course. The walls are normal, thickened or thinned. (3.) Varicose Dilatation. A circumscribed portion of the wall of the vein is dilated so as to form a globular sac. The sac communicates with the vein through a large or small open- ing. The wall of the sac is formed of the coats of the vein, which preserve their normal thickness, are thickened or thinned ; the middle coat may disappear entirely. There may be only one such dilatation, or there may be a number on the same vein, or a number of veins may be affected at the same time. The vein may be otherwise normal, or, more frequently, is dilated in the cirsoid form. (1.) Anastomosing Dilatation. A number of contiguous and anastomosing veins are dilated, both in the cirsoid and varicose forms. The vein then looks like a series of cavities separated by thin partitions. The dilatations of the same vein become adherent to each other and to those of the adjoining veins; portions of the wall of the dilated parts may disappear, and we find a number of cavities containing venous blood, and sepa- rated from each other by thin partitions. The course of the vein can no longer be followed out. Spontaneous cure of dilatations of the veins is not common, and usually occurs only in the lesser degrees of tlie lesion. Most phlebecfasifB increase steadily in size and extent. Very frequently thrombi form in the dilated veins, and either par- tially or completely fill them. The wall of tlie dilated sac may

POST-MOKTEM EXAMINATIONS. 354 by the prevailing uncertainty as to the exact anatomy of con- nective tissue. The classification and names of tumors which I give are, with some modifications, those proposed by Yirchovv, and adopted at the present day by most pathologists. We divide tumors into four classes : I. The Cysts. II. The simple Tissue Tumors. III. The Composite Tissue Tumors. IV. The Cellular Tumors. I. THE CYSTS. Cysts are of three kinds : (1.) Those which are formed in pre- existing cavities. (2.) Those which are new formations. (3.) Those which are formed by an abnormal development of the foetal tissues. (1.) Those which are formed in preexisting cavities : Extra- vasation, exudation, and retention cysts. The extravasation cysts are formed by the escape of blood into the serous sacs and natural cavities of the body. They are also called hsematoma and hematocele. The exudation cysts are formed by the exudation of serum into the serous sacs and natural cavities of the body. They are also called hydrocele and hygroma. The retention cysts are formed by the retention of the excre- tions of glands and the consequent dilatation of their follicles and ducts. They are subdivided into follicular cysts, mucous cysts, and retention cysts of large ducts. To the follicular cysts belong the forms called comedo, milium, molluscum, and atheroma. Atheroma (encysted tu- mor) is the only one of these which is usually classed with the tumors. It is formed by the closure of the mouth of a hair follicle. In consequence of this, the hair follicle itself, and the sebaceous glands which open into it, are dilated. In this way is formed a cyst with a smooth wall and cheesy contents. The contents are made up of fat, epidermis, granular matter, and cholesterine.

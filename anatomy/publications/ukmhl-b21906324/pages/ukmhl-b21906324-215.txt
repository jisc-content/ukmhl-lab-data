205 THE SUPEARENAL CAPSULES. Amyloid Degeneration may involve both the cortical and medullary portions. In tlie cortex, it nsnally involves only the walls of the blood-vessels ; in the medulla, both the blood-vessels and the cells of the parenchyma may undergo this degeneration. The capsules are usually firm and of a grayish, semi-translucent color. NEW GROWTHS. Carcinoma of the suprarenal capsules is not common. It may be primary, but is much more frequently secondary. Either one or both of the capsules may be the seat of the new growth. Sarcoma occurs as a primary and secondary growth. Pro- bably many of the older cases described as cancers were really sarcomata. Miliary Tubercles occur but rarely. Cylindroma.â€”Klebs describes a growth of this character in one of the capsules, secondary to a tumor of the same kind in the supraorbital region. He gives to such tumors the name of lymphangioma cavernosum. The exact character of these growths is still obscure. They consist of irregular follicles and cavities, lined with epithelium, and containing peculiar hya- line, structureless bodies. Cysts are found both single and multiple. They are usually situated in the cortex.

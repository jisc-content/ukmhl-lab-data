DEATH FEOM POISONING. 347 COPPER. Sulphate of copper and verdigris are sometimes employed as poisons. Tlie post-mortem appearances have only been ob- served in a moderate number of cases. The pharynx and oesophagus may be unchanged, or be somewhat inflamed. The stomach may be unchanged, or bits of the copper may adhere to its mucous coat; and there may be patches of inflammation, of gangrene, and even of perforation. TABTAU EMETIC. This preparation of antimony may prove fatal when admin- istered in a single large dose, or in repeated small doses. The post-mortem lesions are not constant. In cases of chronic poisoning there are usually no appreciable lesions. In cases of acute poisoning there may be evidences of acute inflammation of the oesophagus, stomach, intestines, and peri- toneum. The larynx may be congested, and the lungs may be engorged with blood. But none of these lesions are constant. VEGETABLE lEEITANTS. Aloes, colocynth, gamboge, jalap, scammony, savin, croton- oil, colchicum, veratria, turpentine. All these drugs sometimes produce poisonous effects. Vomiting, purging, and prostration are the usual symptoms. Congestion and inflammation of the stomach and intestines are the lesions which would be naturally looked for; but these lesions are sometimes present, sometimes absent. CANTH ABIDES. This substance may be given in powder or in tincture. The entire length of the alimentary canal may be found congested and inflamed. The kidneys, ureters, and bladder may be congested and inflamed.

THE PROSTATE. 269 ginea expands with the growth and incloses it, even wlien of large size. More rarely the stroma is abundant, and the tumor is hard and scirrhous. Metastatic tumors of the inguinal and lumbar glands often occur. Syphilitic Tumors occur in connection with syphilitic orchi- tisii The albuginea is thickened, and bands of fibrous tissue extend into the organ. In this new fibrous tissue we find cheesy nodules, sometimes of considerable size. The epididy- mis is rarely involved. THE PEOSTATE. HYPERTKOPHY AND ATROPHY. Hypertrophy of the prostate is a frequent senile change; it is general or partial. In general hypertrophy, the entire organ is enlarged, and may reach the size of a man's fist. The enlargement is symmetri- cal, or is most marked in one half or in the so-called middle lobe. The organ is hard and dense, or soft, or alveolar, contain- ing numerous small openings, from which a turbid fluid exudes. These different appearances depend upon the character of the hypertrophy. The muscular and fibrous tissue alone may be increased, or at the same time the glandular tissue, or the glandular tissue alone. In partial hypertrophy, we find circumscribed nodules of muscular tissue, or of muscular and glandular tissue. They are usually situated at the periphery of the organ, and project into the bladder. Tliey may become detached from the pros- tate, and are found as small, movable tumors beneath the mucous membrane of the bladder. Both forms of hypertrophy frequently produce retention of urine and changes in the bladder. Atrophy of the prostate is sometimes seen in connection with atrophy of the testicles, and with castration. Sometimes the ducts of the glandular portion are enlarged, or there may be fibrous degeneration of the organ.

These latter bodies are found normally in the ependyma and choroid plexus of the brain, where they are called brain-sand. It is from them that the tumor is named. Although these tumors are of not very infrequent occurrence, and many observations of them have been published, their real nature is still very uncertain. It is convenient, for the present, to give them all this common name, although it is quite possi- ble they may belong to different classes. X. Neuroma.—This name is applied to tumors which are composed of nervous tissue. Such tumors are found on the course of the nerves. They are not to be confounded with tumors of difi'erent structure—^fibromata, myxomata, etc., which also occur on the nerves. We distinguish two varieties according to the character of the nerve fibres. IsTeuroma myelinicum, composed of nerve- fibres, in which the white substance of Schwann is present. l^euroma amyelinicum, composed of small, gray nerve fibres, without the white substance of Schwann. Those of the first kind are much the easiest to recognize and demonstrate. Those of the second kind resemble very closely connective tissue, nr. COMPOSITE tissue tumoes. These are tumors composed, not merely of a simple tissue held together by connective tissue, but of several difi'erent tissues forming an organoid growth. "We distinguish : Angioma, Adenoma. I. Angioma.—This name is given to tumors which are princi- pally composed of a new growth of vessels. We distinguish three varieties : The Simple Angioma, the Cavernous Angioma, and the Cavernous Lymj)h-Angioma.

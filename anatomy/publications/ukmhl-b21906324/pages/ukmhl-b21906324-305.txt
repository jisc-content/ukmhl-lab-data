THE JOINTS. 295 PARASITES. EchinoGOGci are sometimes found in bone. They have the usual form of a mother cyst with daughter cysts. They grow in the bone tissue, but the cysts may burst beneath the perios- teum or in the medulla. CysticerGus Gellulom has been seen in a single case in the first phalanx of the middle finger. THE JOINTS. MALFORMATIONS. One or more of the joints may be absent, or may be in ex- cess, corresponding to the absence or excess of the bones form- ing them. Some of the ligaments may be absent. There may be congenital luxations, fractures, and synostoses. CHANGES IN POSITION. Luxations may be complete or incomplete. They may be intra-uterine, or produced by violence, or by relaxation of the ligaments, or by chronic inflammation of the joints. A full account of dislocations will be found in works on surgery. INFLAMMATION. Acute Synovitis.â€”The earlier stages of acute inflammation of the synovial membranes are better known from experiments on animals than from post-mortem examinations. The first changes are swelling and congestion of the membrane, with in- creased growth and desquamation of epithelium and infiltration of the membrane with lymphoid cells. These conditions are soon followed by an exudation. The exudation may be a clear serum, in which epithelial cells, lymphoid cells, and sometimes blood, will be found. Or floc. culi of fibrine may float in the serum, or the fibrine may be in excess and the serum nearly absent. Or there is an excessive production of lymphoid cells, and the synovial sac is filled with pus. Serous Synovitis may be caused by contusions, penetrating

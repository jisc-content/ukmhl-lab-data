110 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. ture externally or into tlie right ventricle. Tlie sacs may con- tain fluid blood, or be filled iip Avitli fibrine. Siicli aneurisms are usually situated in the wall of the left ventricle ; rarely in that of the left auricle. If they are in the septum, they may project into the right ventricle. They are usually single ; sometimes two or three are found in the same heart. (2.) Fatty degeneration of the heart-wall may reach such] a point that the wall yields and is pouched out into an aneuris- mal sac. (3.) Endocarditis and myocarditis, or fatty degeneration, may so soften a portion of the heart-wall that the endocardium and part of the muscular tissue is ruptured, and a ragged cavity is iornied. This form of aneurism usually does not attain a large size, but soon ruptures externally, and causes the death of the patient. THROMBOSIS OF THE HEART. it is very common to find after death, in the heart-cavities, yellow, succulent, semi-translucent masses. They are most common ana of firmest texture in persons who die of acute inflammatory diseases. They may adhere quite flrmly to the walls of the heart, and may extend in long, branching cords into the vessels. They are formed in the last hours of life, and just after death. They have no clinical or pathological im- jjortance. Coagulations of the fibrine of the blood in the heart do, how- ever, occur during life, and may exist for years. If the fibrine adheres to the valves in small masses, these are called vegeta- tions ; if it coagulates in the heart-cavities in larger bodies, they are called thrombi, or heart polypi. Such thrombi are found in all tlie heart-cavities. They form flattened masses firmly adherent to the endocardium ; or round- ed bodies in the spaces between the trabeculre; or have a poly- poid shape and are attached by a narrow pedicle, or are free in the cavity. They are us\ially found in connection with some valvular

This incision should be made carefully, so as not to cut through the ventricles into the ganglia below. The incision, thus made through the roof of each ven- tricle, is prolonged backward and forward, in the direction of the cornua, until the entire cavity of each lateral ventricle is exposed. A long incision outward and downward is then made into each half of the cerebrum, from the outer edge of

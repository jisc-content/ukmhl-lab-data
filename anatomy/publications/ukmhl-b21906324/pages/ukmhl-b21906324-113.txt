103 THK HEART, CHANGES IN POSITION. Changes in tlie position of the heart are congenital or acquir- ed. The congenital malpositions have been already noticed ; the most important clinically is the transposition of the organ to the right side. The acquired malpositions are caused by: (1.) Hypertrophy of the heart; its long axis approaches the horizontal direction. (2.) Changes in the thoracic viscera. Emphysema of both lungs pushes the heart downward. Emphysema, pleurisy, with effusion, or pneumo-tliorax of one side, push the heart to the other side. Pleurisy or chronic pneumonia, producing retrac- tion of one side of the thorax, draws the heart to that side. New growths, aneurisms, and curvatures of the spine displace the heart in various directions. (3.) Changes in the abdomen. Accumulations of fluid and new growths in the abdomen, and tympanites, may push the heart upward. , WOUNDS AND ETJPTTrEES. Woimds of the heart are produced by penetrating instru- ments, by bullets, and by fragments of bone. The right ventri- cle is the more frequently wounded ; next, the left; rarely, the auricles. The wound may penetrate into the cavities of the heart, or only pass partly through its wall, or a bullet, or the broken end of a weapon, may be imbedded in the wall. If the wound penetrates into a cavity, and is gaping, death follows instantly, and the pericardium is found filled with blood. If the wound be small and oblique, the blood may es- cape gradually, and death does not ensue for several days. In rare cases, adhesions are formed with the pericardium, and the wound cicatrizes. "Wounds which do not penetrate may cause death by the in- flammation, which they excite, or may cicatrize. Bullets and foreign bodies may become encapsuled in the heart-wall, and remain so for years. liuptures of the heart-wall occur in various ways.

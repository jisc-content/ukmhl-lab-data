64 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. Las followed tlie laceration, lymplioid cells and compound gran- ular corpuscles will be present. There may be marked changes in the minute structure of the cord, without any evidence to the naked eye. H^MOKRIIAGE. Apoplexies in tlie substance of the cord are not common. Tlie nervous tissue is disintegrated by the blood. The lesion may cause death in a very short time, or may be followed by myelitis. INFLAMMATION. Myelitis may be traumatic, idiopathic, or secondary. It occurs under so many different conditions, that it is difficult to speak definitely of its causation. It produces either softening or hardening of the cord. (1.) The cord is broken down, of a cream-like consistence, of a reddish or yellow color. The softening may aftect the entire thickness of the cord, or be confined to certain parts; it may extend the entire length of the cord, or be confined to certain regions. It seems to commence usually in the gray matter. The softened portions are composed of broken-down nerve tissue, blood globules, lymphoid cells, and compound granular cor- puscles. The cord may also be softened without any change in its color, and then consists merely of fine granular matter, with a few compound granular corpuscles. (2.) Myelitis causing induration, (sclerosis,) may affect the entire organ or circumscribed portions. The difi'use form ren- ders the cord anaemic and hard throughout. The circumscribed form is identical with tlie sclerose en plaques already described in the brain. Locomotor Ataxy.â€”In this disease, part of the white sub- stance of the cord undergoes a peculiar degeneration. The posterior columns are usually affected. We find them changed, in the earlier stages, into a reddish gray, soft substance. This change is produced by an increase of the neuroglia and an atrophy of the nerve fibres. At a later stage, the affected por- tions are firmer and shrunken. It is a form of sclerosis.

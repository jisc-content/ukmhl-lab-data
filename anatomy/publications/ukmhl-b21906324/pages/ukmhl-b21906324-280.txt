270 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS, INFLAMMATION. Inflammation of the prostate is caused hj gonorrhoea, by in- juries, or, more rarely, is idiopathic. It may run an acute or chronic course. The gland may after a time return to its nor- mal condition, or is gradually converted into a mass of fibrous tissue filled with abscesses. The abscesses may perforate into the bladder, urethra, vesiculse seminales, rectum, or peritoneum. Or the inflammation may extend to the connective tissue of the scrotum, or beneath the pelvic peritoneum. The pus may be- come thickened and cheesy, or even calcified. NEW GROWTHS. Myoma has been already described under the head of partial hypertrophies of the prostate. Tuhercle is found in connection with tubercles in the testicles, vesiculse seminales, and kidneys. Miliary granulations become aggregated in large numbers, and form, after degenerating, large cheesy masses. Concretions are formed in the ducts of the glands. The smallest are rounded, colloid, lamellated bodies, wliicli are stained red by iodine. The larger are hard, yellow or blackish, rounded or faceted, and contain phosphate or oxalate of lime. Carcinoma of the prostate is not frecpient. It is usually primary. It is soft and medullary, and may involve the sur- rounding soft parts. THE MAMMA. The mammae are racemose glands, imbedded in connective tissue and fat. During cliildhood, they remain small and unde- veloped. At puberty, the glands become larger and the acini are increased in size and numljer. The acini are filled witli small, rounded, epithelial cells; the ducts are lined with cylin- drical epithelium. During pregnancy, there is a further in- crease in the size and niunber of the acini, and at full term, the epithelium becomes filled with fat globules. The milk is

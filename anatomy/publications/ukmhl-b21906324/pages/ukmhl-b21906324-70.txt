POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 60 Osteoma occurs in tlie form of isolated, globular tumors in the cerebrum and cerebellum, or lias ratlier the character of an ossi- fication of part of the brain. In these latter cases, it seems to be a late stage of the process of sclerosis. Myxoma.—These tumors are found most fi-equently in the cerebral hemispheres. They are usually of large size, and of soft, gelatinous consistence, so as even to resemble cysts. Fibroma is very rare. It occurs in the form of small, hard, globular tumors. Cholesteatoma is found in the form of rounded tumors, hav- ing a fibrous capsule and a glistening, white consistence. They are made up of crystals of cholesterine and epithelial cells. Angioma may occur in any part of the brain, but is most fre- quent in the floor of the fourth ventricle. Tuhercle is found most frequently in the cerebellum, and usually in children. The tumors may be single or multiple, large or small. They are usually globular, and have a concen- tric appearance; the greater portion often undergoes cheesy degeneration ; but there is sometimes a layer of gray, semi- translucent material at the periphery. Gummata.—Syj^hilitic tumors are found usually near the sur- face of the brain. They have an irregidar shape, the larger tumors being made up of a number of small ones. They have a mottled gray and yellow color. Isolated portions undergo cheesy degeneration, and are separated by other portions, which are grayish and composed of round and fusiform cells, or white and firm, and composed of fibrous tissue. New Growth of tlie Gray Matter of the brain, in the form of isolated nodules imbedded in the white substance, has been de- scribed by Yirchow and others. Cysts and dermoid cysts have been seen in the brain, but are rare. All the tumors of the brain have a tendency to cheesy and fatty degeneration, which renders their anatomical diagno- sis difficidt. PARASITES. Echinococci and Cysticercus cellulosiB are both found in the brain.

POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 320 The Intestines may appear novinal, or the agminated and solitary follicles may be slightly enlarged, or there may be catarrhal or diphtheritic inflammation. The Voluntary Muscles sometimes undergo the same granu- lar and waxy degeneration as in typhoid fever. RELAPSING FEVER. The lesions of relapsing fever are neither characteristic nor constant. In some cases, no marked lesions are to be fomid. The Liver and Spleen are frequently enlarged. The Ltmgs may be congested or hepatized in the lobular or lobar forms. The Kidneys may be congested, or may undergo parenchy- matous degeneration. Haemorrhages in the walls of the alimentary canal, the air- passages, and in the skin are sometimes found. MALARIAL FEVERS. INTEEMITTENT AND REMITTENT FEVER. The lesions of malarial poisoning are usually characteristic and well marked. Their extent varies with the intensity and duration of the disease and the period at which the patient dies. Intermittent Fever corresponds to a mild degree of malarial poisoning, and seldom causes death. Remittent Fever, especially the " pernicious" form, corre- sponds to an intense degree of the poison, and frequently causes death. The Blood.â€”The most constant lesion is the presence of lit- tle particles of black or reddish pigment in the blood. The pigment is in the form of flakes, or of granules imbedded in small, irregular, transparent, flnely-granular bodies. We also find these same transparent bodies without pigment, some of them lookino- like round and fusiform cells. Sometimes there is an increase of white blood-globules.

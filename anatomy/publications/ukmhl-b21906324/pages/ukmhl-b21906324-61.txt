THE EPENDYMA AND THE CHOROID PLEXUS. 51 cles contain a moderate amount of serum made turbid hj pus globules and broken-down particles of tissue. The ependyma is coated and infiltrated with tlie same material. The layer of brain tissue next the ependyma is softened or stained witli small apoplexis. Or the entire brain may be softened and. cedematous. Sometimes the ependyma is coated with a thick layer of lymphoid cells and fibrine. I have seen, in an adult, the ependyma thickened, of a mottled gray and red color; the brain substance next it soft and red ; very little serum in the ventricles; no lesion in any other part of the brain ; and the patient died comatose. NEW GROWTHS. Connective Tissue may occur as a new growth, causing a imi- iQrm thickening of the ependyma, or the thickening may be in plateSy or in small granulations. In rare cases, small fibrous tumors are attached to the ependyma by narrow pedicles, and these tumors may become free. The new growth of connective tissue may cause adhesions between the walls of the ventricles. Calcification and ossification of the thickened ependyma has been seen in a few instances. Lipoma.â€”Small, fatty tumors have been found attached to the ependyma and choroid plexus. Enchondroma has been observed in the choroid plexus in small nodules. Cystoid Growths occur very commonly in the choroid plexus in the form of little transparent vesicles. These little vesicles are not really cysts, but are composed of small, transparent cells closely packed together. These bodies have no patho- logical significance. A cyst, as large as a walnut, filled with colloid matter, and a dermoid cyst containing hair, have been observed in this situation. Angioma may occur in the choroid plexus. Carcinoma has been seen in very rare cases in the plexus of the fourth ventricle, and the ependyma of the lateral ventricles.

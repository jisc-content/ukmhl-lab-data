More frequently it is produced by syphilis, either in the form of superficial iilcers, or of deep and extensive destructions of tissue from the softening of gummy tumors. Lupus, also, sometimes attacks the upper part of the pharynx. TJlceroiion of the (Esophagus is not common, and but little is kTKÂ»wn concerning it. Some authors describe a simple perforat- ing ulcer, similar to that of the stomach. Foreign bodies in the oesophagus may perforate its wall, as already mentioned. Per- forations of the cesoi^hagns from without may be produced by inflamed bronchial glands, by cavities and gangrene of the lungs, by emphysema, by abscesses in the mediastinum, by ab- scesses accompanying caries of the vertebrte, and by aneurisms of the aorta. Cases have been described of rupture of the normal wall of the oesophagus by violent coughing and vomiting; but it seems probable that there was really some previous disease. DILATATION AND STENOSIS. The oesophagus may be dilated throughout its entire length, or at some one point. The general dilatation is most frequent- ly caused by stenosis of the cardiac orifice of the stomach. The Avail of the oesophagus is usually hypertrophied. Less frequently the entire oesophagus is dilated, without any satisfactory cause to account for it. The dilatation may be so great that a man's arm can be introduced into the cavity of the oesophagus. Its walls are then usually thickened, but sometimes thinned. The circumscribed dilatations may be fusiform or sacculated. The fusiform dilatations are congenital, or are produced by a stenosis at any part of the canal. The sacculated dilatations are situated at the upper part of the oesophagus or the lower part of the pharynx. They begin as a small pouch in the posterior wall and at right angles to it. Such

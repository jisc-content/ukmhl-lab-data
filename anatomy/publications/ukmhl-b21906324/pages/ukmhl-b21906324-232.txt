POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 222 assumes a trabeciilated appearance. The organ retains its normal capacity, or is dilated, or becomes smaller. Tlie mucous mem- brane is frequently the seat of chronic or acute inflammation. Dilatation of the ureters and hydronephrosis frequently accom- pany this condition. IlernioB of the bladder sometimes accompany intestinal hernise through the inguinal and crural canals, and the foramen ovale. The changes in position of the bladder, produced by dis- placements of the vagina and xiterus, will be mentioned with the lesions of those organs. KTJPTUKE.â€”PEKFOEATION. Penetrating wounds of the bladder may produce escape of urine into the abdominal cavity, or infiltration into the sur- rounding connective tissue, or permanent fistuliB. Such wounds are always serious and frequently fatal. Rupture of the bladder may be produced by severe blows and falls when the bladder contains urine. More rarely, rupture takes place from over-distention. I have seen this occur in a patient who was being etherized preparatory to puncturing the bladder. Fractures of the pelvic bones may prpduce laceration of the bladder. Perforations of the bladder are produced by ulceration and gangrene, by abscesses from without, and by cancerous ulcera- tion from the adjoining organs. INFLAMMATION. Catarrhal Cystitis may be idiopathic; or excited by decom- posed urine, or by calculi; or be an extension of gonorrhoeal urethritis, or vaginitis. It may run an acute or a chronic course. In the acute form, the mucous membrane is SAVollen and in- tensely congested. Pus, mucus, and blood are set free from its surface. In the chronic form, the mucous membrane is at first swollen, succulent, grayish, or mottled with spots of congestion and extravasation, covered with a layer of muco-pus. Later, the

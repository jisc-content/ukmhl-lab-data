189 THE LIVER. of producing a firm thrombus and obliterating tlie vessel, some- times produces a soft, puriform thrombus which extends into the portal vein. The walls of the vein are thick and succulent; there are frequently abscesses in the liver and general peritoni- tis. 2. (Ilceration of the intestines and stomach sometimes pro- duces thrombosis of the veins leading from the part inflamed, and the thrombi are continued into the portal vein, or fragments of them are carried into it. 3. Abscesses of the spleen sometimes produce thrombosis of the splenic vein, which is continued into the portal vein. 4. Suppurative inflammation of the mesentery, and of the mesenteric glands, may produce thrombosis of the mesenteric and portal veins. 5. Inflammation and ulceration of the bile-ducts caused by gall-stones occasionally produce thrombosis of the branches of the portal vein. 6. In inany cases of thrombosis and inflammation of the por- tal vein no cause can be discovered for the lesion. In all the varieties of soft thrombi and phlebitis of the portal vein, we usually find jaundice, sometimes abscesses of the liver, sometimes enlargement of the spleen, and, as a rule, acute symptoms during life. KUPTUEE OF THE POETAL VEIN. This is a very rare lesion, of Avhich only a few cases are re- corded. In some of the cases there was fatty degeneration of the wall of the vein. DILATATION OF THE PORTAL VEIN. Dilatation may afiect the trunk, branches, or roots of the por- tal vein, but very rarely the entire vessel. It is caused by destruction of the capillaries of the liver from chronic atrophy and cirrhosis ; and from occlusion of the vein by thrombi, by cancer, and by concretions. The dilatation is generally uniform, sometimes vr.ricosG.

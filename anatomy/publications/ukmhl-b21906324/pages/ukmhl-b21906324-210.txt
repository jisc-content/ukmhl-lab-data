200 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. Inflammation of tlie spleen itself occurs in the form of ab- scesses or infarctions. The abscesses may be traumatic, or pro- duced by infarctions, or occur without known cause. The ab- scesses are single or multiple. They may reach a great size; they may rupture into the abdominal cavity, the pleura, the lungs, the stomach, the colon, or the kidneys. Infarctions of the spleen are very common. Vegetations on the heart-valves, and thrombi in some of the veins, are the usual causes. Sometimes no source for the embolus can be discovered. We find one or more wedge-shaped portions of the spleen, at its surface, at first infiltrated with blood, and afterward convert- ed into a yellow, cheesy mass, or into a fibrous cicatrix. Less frequently suppurative infiammation ensues, and an abscess is formed. In other cases, again, the infarction becomes gangre- nous, and rarely the gangrene may involve the greater part of the spleen. In consequence of the gangrene, fatal peritonitis may ensue. DEGENERATION. Waxy degeneration, or rather infiltration of the spleen, is very common. It affects the entire organ, or only the Malpi- ghian bodies. In the first case, the organ is large, firm, smooth, reddish, and waxy-looking. Nearly the entire tissue is infil- trated with the waxy substance, and reacts with iodine. If only the Malpighian bodies are affected, the spleen appears to be studded with small, round, grayish bodies looking like grains of boiled sago. We then find the vessels and cells of the Mal- pighian bodies infiltrated with the waxy matter. This form is called the sago spleen. NEW GRO"\VTnS. Fibroma.â€”Small, rounded nodules of fibrous tissue have been seen in the spleen in a few cases. Cysts are rare. They are single or multiple, and contain serum. Single dermoid cysts, filled with fat and hair, have also been seen.

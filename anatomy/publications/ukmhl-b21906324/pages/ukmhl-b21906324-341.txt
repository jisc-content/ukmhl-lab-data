SUNSTROKE. 331 The chronic form of the disease is still more difficult of diag- nosis. The nodules grow very slowly, are hard, and may occur in groujjs, or like a string of beads. The nodules may soften and form deep, chronic ulcers. HYDEOPHOBIA. There are no characteristic lesions in this disease. Congestion of the nervous centres, and congestion and swell- ing of the mouth and pharynx, are observed in some cases. Decomposition usually commences soon after death. SUNSTROKE. During the hot summer months, cases of sunstroke are of fre- quent occurrence in New-York. The persons affected are, for the most part, adult male laborers, usually of intemperate habits. It is necessary to separate from the cases of sunstroke proper, when the patient is attacked while exposed to the heat of the sun, the cases of exhaustion from heat and fatigue, which may occur as well in the house. The patients who are seriously affected by sunstroke, exhibit, during life, an intense heat of the skin, convulsions, and coma. Death in many cases soon ensues. After death, decomposition sets in very early, owing to the state of the weather. In autopsies which I have, made within two hours after death, the increased heat of the skin was still maintained. The Brain and its membranes were in some cases congested ; in others not. Sometimes there was an increased amount of serum beneath the pia mater ; sometimes there were small and thin extravasations of blood beneath the pia mater, and between the pia and dura mater. In the other viscera there were no lesions except those due to the condition of coma, existing before death. The lungs and kidneys were frequently congested.

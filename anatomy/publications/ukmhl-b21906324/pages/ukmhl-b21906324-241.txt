231 THE VULVA.' Fibroma Tuberosum.—Circumscribed fibrous tumors are found in the connective tissues of the labia, the mons veneris, the perineum, the clitoris, and the entrance of the A^agina. They may attain a large size, and may be attached only by a narrow pedicle. When a section is made, it will be found that the tumor is a circumscribed growth, not continuous with the skin. Lipoma.—Fatty tumors are found in the mons veneris and labia majora. They may reach a large size. Enchondroma.—Schneevogt describes a polypoid, cartilagi- nous tumor growing from the clitoris. Cysts are found in the connective tissue of the labia majora and minora. They are from the size of a pea to that of a child's head. They contain serum, colloid matter, pus, or blood, or have the character of dermoid cysts. They may open through the skin. Cj'sts are also formed by dilatation of the ducts or acini of the vulvo-vaginal gland. Carcinoma of the vulva is rare. It is usually accompanied by the same growth in the uterus and vagina, or in the other vis- cera. It occurs in the form of nodules, which, after a time, ulcerate. Epithelioma is more common. It usually begins in one of the labia majora. There is at first induration and thickening of a circumscribed portion of the labium, afterward ulceration. The inguinal glands may become involved, but metastatic tu- mors are rare. Lupus occurs in the labia majora and minora, the mons vene- ris, and the perineum in its usual forms. The cutis is infiltrated with small round cells. When the cell-growth reaches the sur- face of the skin, the epithelium falls off, and an ulcerating sur- face is formed. According to the extent of the infiltration and of the ulceration, Ave have the varieties : Lupus maculosus, no- dosus, hypertrophicus, exulcerans.

207 THE KIDNEYS. case is recorded by Blasius in wliicli there were two left kid- neys, each with its vessels and iireter. The kidneys, are sometimes joined together. This is effected by a bridge of kidney tissue, uniting the lower ends of the two kidneys. Sometimes sucli a " horse-shoe" kidney is situated lower than usual over tlie lowest lumbar vertebra, or in the pel- vis. The renal vessels are then given off from some abnormal point. In other cases the two kidneys are united throughout, so as to look like a single misshapen kidney, with two or more pel- ves. The kidneys thus closely united may be both situated on one side of the vertebral column, or in the pelvis. The arrange- ment and origin of their vessels vary according to the situa- tion of the kidnej'S. CHANGES IN POSITION. The kidneys may have an abnormal situation, in which they are either fixed or movable. The change in position is either lateral or downward. The most frequent situation is the promontory of the sacrum ; but the kidney has been seen at the very bottom of the pelvic cavi- ty. The vessels have an irregular origin and distribution cor- responding to the changed position of the kidney. The kidney is firmly attached in its unusual position. Movable or wandering kidneys are not congenital, but are found in adult life as a result of tight-lacing, pregnancy, over- exertion, and from unknown causes. They are more frequent in females than in males. The right kidney is the one more frequently movable ; but both organs may be found in this con- dition. Sometimes a kidney, which is congenitally misplaced, is also movable. The ordinary movable kidneys have their vessels regularly given off, but lengthened. The kidney tissue may be normal or may undergo any of the ordinary pathological changes. Cases have been observed in which the kidney, by its unusual position, had compressed the ascending colon, and had caused thrombosis of the vena cava.

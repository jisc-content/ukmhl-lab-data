368 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. looked upon as less malignant than the true carcinomata, but their prognosis is by no means good. (2.) True carcinoma consists of a connective tissue stroma and cells. If the stroma is abundant and dense, the growth is called scirrhus ; if the cells are abundant and the stroma scanty, the growth is called medullary. The cells do not exactly resemble normal epithelium, although they have that general character, but are often malformed in various ways. They are contained in regular tubular, ovoid, or rounded alveoli; or, if the stroma is scanty, apj)ear irregularly distributed. The prognosis of these growths is bad. (3.) Colloid Carcinoma. These growths have a gelatinous ap- pearance and consistence. They are formed of a fibrous stroma, which forms small, rounded cavities tilled with colloid matter and cells. The cells resemble pavement epithelium ; they are numerous, few, or absent. The colloid matter is said to be formed by a change in the cells; but in some of the smallest and youngest growths, we find alveoli filled with colloid matter and no cells. The prognosis of these growths is bad.

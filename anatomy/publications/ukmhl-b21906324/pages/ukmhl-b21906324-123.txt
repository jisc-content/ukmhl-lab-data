113 THE HEART. althougli a general increase of the subpericardial fat is com- mon. Myoma striocellulare.â€”Tumors formed of voluntary muscle liave been seen in three cases as a congenital lesion. The tu- mors were single or multiple, some as large as a cherry, of the consistence and appearance of the surrounding heart-wall, but looking like circumscribed nodules. In one case, the tumor was cavernous. In one case, there were also gummy tumors in the heart-wall. A single case has been observed, in an adult, in which the en- tire wall of the left ventricle was changed into a spongy mass, which may belong to the same category. Syphilitic Gummata may occur at any point of the ventricu- lar wall. They are usually multiple, may reach the size of a pigeon's egg, are of a whitish or yellow color, of fibrous or cheesy consistence ; sometimes softer. They are composed of small round cells developed between the muscular fibres. The tumors may be almost entirely composed of cells, or may be partly cheesy, or mixed with fibrous tissue. Tubercle are found in the heart-wall in the form of miliary granulations. They have also been observed in the valves. Cysts containing serum, and others containing a grumous fluid, have been seen in rare cases. Sarcoma sometimes occurs as a metastatic growth. Carcinoma of the heart as a primary tumor is "very rare. ISTodules secondary to growths in the mediastinum or other re- gions are more common. Epithelial cancer in this organ is de- scribed by Paget and Yirchow. Carcinomatous thrombi in the heart cavities sometimes occur as secondary formations from the same growth in other regions. PAEASITES. Echinococci are sometimes found in the walls of the ventri- cles in their usual form of hydatid cysts. Cysticercus sometimes occurs in connection with cysticerci in the voluntary muscles. 8

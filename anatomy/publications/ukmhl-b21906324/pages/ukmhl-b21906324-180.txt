POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS, 170 Tuberdes.—Gray and yellow miliary granulations are found in the peritoneum in some cases of general tuberculosis. They are found in the omentum without any inflammatory le- sions, or in the peritoneum, over ulcers of the intestines, or in connection with fibrinous exudation and membranous adhesions in tubercular peritonitis. Cysts.—In rare cases, dermoid cysts containing fat, hair, bones, etc., are found in the parietal and visceral peritoneum, and in the omentum. These are probably congenital. Roki- tansky describes a cystic degeneration of the mesenteric glands. In the broad ligaments of the litems, both serous and colloid cysts are found. PARASITES. Ecliinococci are found in hydatid cysts, beneath the capsule of the liver, in the omentum, and beneath the parietal and vis- ceral peritoneum. They are surrounded by false membranes. THE LIVER. MALFOEMATIONS. Congenital malformations of the liver are not common, and are of little practical importance. The organ may be entirely wanting, the lobes may be diminished or increased in number ; its form may be altered, so that it is rounded, flattened, triangu- lar, or quadrangular. The gall-bladder may be wanting, the ductus choledochus may be double, both ducts emptying into the duodenum, or one emptying into the duodenmn, the other into the tomach. The single ductus choledochus may also empty into the stomach. In congenital transposition of the viscera, the liver is found on the left side, the stomach and spleen on the right side. Small, isolated bodies, having the same structure as the liver, have been found in the suspensory ligament. They arc analo- gous to tlie little accessory spleens.

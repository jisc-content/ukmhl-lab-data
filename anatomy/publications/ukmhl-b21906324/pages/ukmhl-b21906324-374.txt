364 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. In the mamma, there are new growths of mammary glandu- lar tissue. In the ovaries, most of the compound cysts are adenomata with dilatation of the follicles. The ordinary bronchocele is an adenoma of the thyroid gland. Combinations of adenoma with sarcoma and papilloma are not infrequent. IV. CELLULAK TUMORS. This general and indefinite name is used, because it is general and indefinite, to group together a number of tumors of which we cannot yet decide the exact relationship. We include under it the following varieties : Tuhercle^ Syphilitic Gummata, Lujous, Lymphoma, Sarcoma, Carcinoma. I. Tubercle.—This name is now generally applied only to the small, gray, miliary granulations, which we find in the serous and mucous membranes and in many of the viscera. Even of these bodies we find different descriptions by different authors. In the pia mater, the little tumors are formed by an accumu- lation of lymphoid cells between the perivascular sheath of the small vessels and their outer coats. In other situations, the growths are made up of lymphoid cells, fusiform cells, large, many-nucleated bodies, (rayeloplaxes,) large flat cells with a single nucleus, and a delicate reticulum of branched fibrous tissue. Cheesy degeneration begins early at the centre of each little nodule. II. Syphilitic Gummata.—These growths stand on the border line between inflammatory growths and new growths proper. They form tumors from the size of a pin's head to that of a man's fist. They are composed of small, round, oval, and fusi-

POST-MOETEM EXAMINATIONS. 62 HoBmorrhages occur idiopatliically, or from injuries, or from general convulsions. Serum is present beneath the pia mater to a greater or less degree. It is difficult to say how large an amoxmt is patho- logical. ESTFLAIEMATIOX. Spinal meningitis is found at all ages. It may be idiopathic, traumatic, rheumatic, or caiised by inflammation of the brain, the dura mater, or the vertebrre, or occur as epidemic cerebro- spinal meningitis. The disease usually attacks the entire length of the mem- brane. An exudation composed of serum, lymphoid cells, and fibrine iniiltrates the pia mater and raises it up from the cord. NEW GKOWTHS. Fibroma of the pia mater, compressing the cord, has been observed. Bone, in the form of small plates, sometimes occurs. Carcinoma may occur as circumscribed tumors, or as difi'nsed masses. MALFOKMATIONS. Ilydrorachis, Sj^ina Bifida, consists in dropsy and atrophy of the cord, with or without malformation of the vertebraB. (1.) The vertebral canal is open on its posterior surface for its entire length; the cord is absent, the nerves are inserted into the spongy hsemorrhagic membranes. (2.) The vertebral canal is closed. The central canal of the cord is dilated with serum, or the cord is absent, and the mem- branes are dilated with serum; or there may be an accumula- tion of serum beneath the pia mater, with or without atrophy of tlie cord. (3.) 'At some portion of the vertebral canal its posterior wall is absent, so that the membranes protrude as a sac, filled with serumâ€”Spina Bifida. The serum accumulates in the central canal, or beneath the pia mater. The cord is absent, or rudi- mentary, or well formed. The walls of the sac are formed ot dura and pia mater, or of pia mater alone. Rarely tlierc is no fissure in the bones, and the sac protrudes between the laminar

DEATH FEOM POISONING. 345 consistence of the organ is at first flabby; in tbe later stages, that of the ordinary fatty liver. The hepatic cells are increased in size, granular, and, after a time, contain small oil-globules. The oil-globules afterward increase in size and number, but do not fuse together to fill each cell with a single oil-globule, as in the ordinary fatty liver. Finally there may be breaking down of the cells into a mass of fat and granules. In the interstitial tissue of the liver, we may find collections of lymphoid cells, also in the adventitia of the branches of the portal vein, and in the lobules. The Kidneys.â€”There is often granular and fatty degenera- tion of the epithelium of the tubes. There may be granular degeneration of the voluntary muscu- lar fibres throughout the body and in the heart. ARSENIC. From tAVO to three grains of arsenious acid is nsually consi- dered a fatal dose. But persons have recovered after taking a much larger quantity. Death usually takes place in from eighteen hours to three days. But persons have died within twenty minutes, and others not for twenty days. The mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus may be inflamed, but are more frequently unaltered. The stomach may be empty, or contain mucus mixed with blood. The arsenic in substance may be found adlierent to the mucous membrane. The entire inner surface may be red and inflamed, or there are patches or streaks of congestion. The inflamed patches may be thickened and covered with false membrane. There may be acute gastritis even when the poison is absorbed by the skin, and not introduced into the stomach; Taylor mentions a case in which the coats of the stomach were thickened and gelatinous, but not congested; or there may be degeneration of the gastric follicles as in phosphorus poisoning. The entire length of the intestine may be congested and in- flamed, but usually the action of the poison does not extend beyond the duodenum. In some cases, the solitary and agmin-

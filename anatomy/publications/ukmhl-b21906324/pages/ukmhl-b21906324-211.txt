201 THE PANCREAS. Tubercles are found in the capsule and in the splenic tissue in the form of gray granulations. Syphilitic Gummata have been seen in the spleen. Lymphatic Tumors in the form of white nodules are found in leucaemia and in pseudo-leucaemia. Pigment.â€”In persons who are the subjects of malarial poi- soning, the spleen is usually enlarged, and of a black color. The position and source of the pigment, which causes this color, is still uncertain. Carcinoma is very rarely primary in the spleen. More fre- quently it is metastatic; sometimes directly infiltrated from new growths in the stomach. PARASITES. Echinococci are sometimes found in the spleen, either as iso- lated bodies or as composite cysts. Pentastomum denticulatum in a calcified condition has been seen by Wagner. THE PANCREAS. MALFORMATIONS. The pancreas may be entirely absent in anencephalous and double monsters, and in congenital umbilical hernise. The pancreatic duct may be double; it may open into the duode- num at some distance from the biliary duct, or into the sto- mach. The head of the pancreas may be unduly developed, and sometimes even completely separated from the rest of the organ, opening into the duodenum with a duct of its own. CHANGES IN FOKM AND POSITION. The pancreas is so firmly bound down that its position is not often changed. Sometimes, however, it is found pressed down- ward by tight lacing, displaced by aneurisms, or contained in umbilical and diaphragmatic hernia. Atrophy of the pancreas is produced by the pressure of

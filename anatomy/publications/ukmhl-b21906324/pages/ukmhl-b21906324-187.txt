THK LIVER. 177 but is produced by tlie destruction of some of the acini, and the consequent nndue prominence of otliers. The liver-cells are destroyed, or are small and granular. This lesion may produce jaundice, ascites, and sometimes . death. INTERSTITIAL HEPATITIS. Interstitial hepatitis is acute, and leads to the formation of abscesses ; or chronic, and results in the formation of new con- nective tissue. PUEULENT HEPATITIS. The study of the formation of abscesses in the liver has been very much confused by confounding two separate pathological conditions. (1) Abscesses formed by a purulent hepatitis; (2) abscesses formed by the irritation of emboli, and from throm- bosis of the portal vein. The description of the first stages ot the lesion is usually drawn from the second, and of the latter stages from the first of these conditions. (1.) Idiopathic abscesses are of rare occurrence, except in tro- pical climates. In temperate climates, so few cases are seen that we know but little of their causation. A few cases are re- corded in which severe contusions were the exciting causes of abscesses of the liver. Dysentery, with ulceration of the large intestine, is sometimes associated with single abscesses of the liver 3 but the exact relation between them is not well known. Inflammation and ulceration of the bile-ducts, excited by the presence of biliary calculi, or of intestinal worms, may produce multiple abscesses by the extension of the inflammation from the ducts to the liver tissue. Of the earlier stages of idiopathic suppurative hepatitis but little is known. The abscesses are not seen in autopsies until after they are fully formed. They may then reach a large size, and are usually single, though sometimes multiple. They may be opened by the surgeon through the abdominal wall; or rup- ture spontaneously into the pleural cavity, the lungs, the abdo- minal cavity, the stomach and intestines, the hepatic vein, the 12

198 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 2. Of cholesterine, bile-pigment, and sometimes carbonate and pliospliate of lime. They are usually dark-colored, brown, red, black, or green, round or faceted. 3. Principally of bile-pigment. These are small, not nume- rous, dark-colored. 4. Of carbonate of lime. These are uncommon, have a nodular surface, and a clear, crystalline fracture. Most calculi consist of a nucleus and body. The nucleus is composed of cholesterine and bile-pigment; or, more rarely, of some foreign body. A dead parasite, a needle, and stones of fruit have been found as nuclei. The body of the gall-stone is homogeneous or laminated. Biliary calculi in the gall-bladder usually produce no symp- toms, and are only discovered after the death of the patient. In the hepatic and common ducts they may obstruct the flow of bile and produce fatal jaundice, or they pass from time to time into the intestine, and produce biliary colic. If they are impacted in the cystic duct, they may produce dilatation of the gall-bladder. THE SPLEEN. MALFORltATIONS. The spleen may be entirely absent in acephalous monsters, and with defective development of the other abdominal viscera. Yery rarely it is absent in persons who are otherwise perfectly developed. Small accessory spleens, not larger than a walnut, and situat- ed close to the spleen, are not iinfrequent. The existence of two spleens of equal size has been observed in one case. The spleen may be on the right side when there is transposi- tion of the other viscera. IIYPERTKOPIIY, ATROPHY. In cases of typhoid fever, pyoemia, cholera, the exanthemata, malarial fevers, etc., the spleen is usually enlarged, soft, and of

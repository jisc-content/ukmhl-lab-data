THE LUNGS. 75 Lipoma in the submucous tissue lias been seen in one case by Kokitansky, THE LUNGS. MALFOKMATIONS. One or botli lungs may be entirely wanting, or only pai-tially developed. A peculiar degeneration, by wliicli the lung is converted into a number of sacs containino' air and serum, and communicatino- with the bronchi, has been seen in a few instances. The lobes may be subdivided by deep fissures. An accessory lobe, separated from "the lung, has been seen between the base of the left lung and the diaphragm. There may be hernia of the lung, with absence of part of the thoracic wall. There may be transposition of the lungs, with the same change in the position of the heart and liver. In rare cases, the congenital smallness of the lungs remains, and persons continue to live for a number of years. INJURIES. PERFOKATIONS. Contusions of the thorax may cause rupture of the lung tissue and fatal haemorrhage. The lungs may be wounded by pi'ojec- tiles and penetrating instruments of all kinds, and by frag- ments of bone. Even severe injui'ies of this nature may not prove fatal. Collections of pus in the pleural cavities and mediastinum, and abscesses of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, may perforate the lungs. Fistulous openings from the lungs through the thoracic wall may be formed during phthisis, emphysema, gangrene of the lungs, abscesses, hydatids, and wounds. CONGESTION AND OEDEMA. These conditions are found in the dead body not only as post- mortem changes, but also as evidences of the same conditions during life.

Suppurative osteitis, abscess of hone.—This process occurs usually in the ends of the long bones. It begins with a rarefying osteitis. The medulla goes on to actual suppuration, the bone-tissue is destroyed, and a circumscribed cavity is formed in the bone, filled with pus, and lined with granulation- tissue. Less frequently, abscesses are formed in the shaft of a long bone, by a circumscribed suppuration of tbe medulla. These abscesses usually occur in old people. They last for many years, have little tendency to perforation, may gradually enlarge, and be accompanied by an ossifying periostitis, so tliat the bone is expanded. Very rarely acute suppurative osteitis, with rapid formation of an abscess, and perforation, has been observed. CARIES. The word caries is used by many as synonymous witli clu'onic osteitis. It is convenient, however, to limit the term to one variety of osteitis—the ulcerative. In this sense, caries of bone corresponds to ulceration of the soft parts. One of the simplest forms of caries is produced by chronic, suppurative arthritis. The articular cartilages are destroyed, the bone beneath undergoes molecular destruction, so that the cancellous diploe are laid open. The medulla then takes on an ulcerative inflammation. In other cases, we find a rarefying osteitis, with a destruc- tive, ulcerative character. At some portion of the inflamed bone, either on its surface or in its cancellous tissue, the inflam- ed medulla suppurates, and is destroyed with the corresponding portions of bone. Sometimes this process is combined with cheesy degeneration of the products of inflammation, so that dry, yellow masses are found in the dij)loe, and replacing the destroyed bone. The minute changes are very similar to those in chronic os-

259 THE PENIS. ment of the ovum in the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube. Adhesions are formed, so that the foetus is partly in the end of the tube and partly in the abdomen. Interstitial Pregnancy.—The ovum is arrested and deve- loped in the portion of the tube which passes through the wall of the uterus. Ovarian Pregnancy.—The ovum is developed in its Graafian follicle. The existence of this form of extra-uterine pregnancy is doubtful. Abdominal Pregnancy.—The ovum after escaping from the ovary does not enter the Fallopian tube, but becomes fixed at some point near it. It is siuTounded by thickened peritoneum and developed in that position. In all forms of extra-uterine pregnancy, the uterus becomes enlarged, and a sort of decidua is formed on its internal surface. THE PENIS. MALFORMATIONS. Entire absence of the penis is met with in connection with great defects of development of the rest of the body. Absence of the penis with proper development of the other organs of generation is rare. The urethra then nsually opens into the rectum. An abnormally small penis is found, with absence or arrested development of the testicles. Absence of the prepuce has been observed in a number of cases. Congenital phinosis is also not infrequent. Hypospadia consists in an arrest of development of the penis and scrotum. In its highest degrees, the penis is one half to one inch long, the glans penis small and resembling a clitoris. On the lower side of the penis is a deep cleft, lined with mu- cous membrane. Into this cleft the urethra opens at the root of the penis. The scrotum remains separated into two halves^ resembling labia majora. The testes descend into their proper position on each side, or remain in the abdomen. If the testi- cles continue to develop normally, the individual has the appear-

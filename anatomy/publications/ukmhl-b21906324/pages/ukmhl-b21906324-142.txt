POST-MOBTEM EXAMINATIONS. 132 Small cysts ai'e sometimes found iu the mucous membrane of the tongue. In the floor of the mouth, beneath the tongue, dermoid cysts haA'e been observed. Angioma.â€”Cavernous vascular tumors are found in the sub- stance of the tongue, and projecting from its surface. Lipoma and Fibroma are rare. They may occur as nodules, or project in a polypoid form. Composite tumors, largely com- posed of fat, are found in the tongue as a congenital condition. Tiibercles are found iu rare cases in the form of ulcers, of which the walls are infiltrated with miliary tubercles. Syphilitic Gicmmata occur as white nodules in the intermus- cular fibrous tissue. JLupus occurs in the form of nodules and of ulcers at the base of the tongue. Sarcoma in this situation appears not to have been described. I have seen one such tumor in a young child. It formed a nodule as large as a chestnut, and was composed of roimd and fusiform cells. Epithelioma may begin as a j^rimary growth iu the tongue ; or the growth may invade it from the adjoining tissues. It may destroy a large part of tlie organ, invade the floor of the mouth, and form secondaiy tumors in the adjoining lymphatic glands. THE PIIAKYXX AND THE CESOPIIAGUS. MALFOKIIATIONS. Fistulous openings from the pharynx, running between the muscles, and perforating the skin, have been seen in rare in- stances. These fistulte are so small as to have iio practical in- terest. The oesophagus may be entirely absent, or its lower portion may be present, and joined to the pharynx by a solid cord ; or the pharynx, or the lower part of the oesophagus, may be con- tinuous with the trachea ; or the entire oesophagus may be re- presented by a solid cord. Diverticula of the pharynx, dilatations of the a'sophagus, and

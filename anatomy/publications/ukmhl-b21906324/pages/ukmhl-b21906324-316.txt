306 POST-MOKTEM EXAMINATIONS. mation involves the outer and middle walls of tlie vein, produc- ing little abscesses and consequent necrosis of portions of the inner coat. "Waldeyer says that there may be, without suppu- ration, an inflammation of the entire wall of a vein, resulting in the forjuation of minute elevations on its internal surface. (7.) Emboli may produce thrombi about them and in the veins corresponding to the arteries which they obstruct. The causes of embolism are also various. (1.) Fragments of thrombi in the veins are the most frequent material of emboli. (2.) Tlirombi of the heart, vegetations on the valves and on the walls of the aorta. (3.) Portions of the endocardium and of the inner coat of the aorta may degenerate and be detached from endarteriitis. (4.) Portions of tumors which project into the veins, the pig- mented bodies in melansemia, and fat may form emboli. In a considerable number of cases, it is impossible to find any source for the embolus. It must be remembered, however, in emboli, in connection with wounds, that not only the veins of the wounded region are to be examined, but also those of the pelvis. For, while there are no venous thrombi from the injury, there may be some from the decubitus and condi- tion of the patient. The consequences of thrombosis vary with the situation of the clot. Thrombi in the arteries produce ansemia of the region sup- plied by the artery, or congestion from the collateral circulation. Later, there may be inflammatory changes, softening, or gan- grene. Thrombi in the veins produce inflammation in and around the vein, oedema, thickening of the skin, and connective tissue, gangrene, lifemorrhages. Thrombi in the capillaries produce circumscribed congestions and hfemorrhages, (infarctions,) followed by degenerative and inflammatory changes, or there may be a more difiused gan- grene. The consequences of embolism vary with the character of the â€¢embolus and its situation.

127 THE MOUTH. tlie tongue is absent. Such a malformation is rare; tlie foetus is not viable. (2.) The face remains in its early foetal condition of a large cleft; the mouth and nose form one cavity; the orbits may be united in the same cavity. The fcetus is not viable. (3.) There is a cleft in the upper lip, upper jaw, and hard palate. The cleft corresponds to the point of junction of the processes of the siiperior maxilla with the intermaxillary bone. There may be one cleft or two, one on either side of the inter- maxillary bone. The cleft involves the lip alone ; or the lip and superior maxilla; or the lip, maxilla, and palate. There may be a single or a double cleft in the palate; and the cleft may involve either the hard or soft j)alate, or both. If there are two clefts of the lip and maxilla, the portion of lip and bone between them may be small, or entirely absent, so as to leave a lai'ge open space. The soft palate may be entirely absent. This is a common malformation, and does not endanger life. (4.) Rarely we find a cleft involving the middle of the lower lip, and sometimes extending into the inferior maxilla. (5.) Either the inferior, the superior, or both maxillary bones may be abnormally smalh (6.) The edges of the lips may be partly or completely joined together. The opening of the mouth may be only a round hole. (7.) The lips may be absent, or imperfectly developed. (8.) The corners of the mouth may be prolonged by clefts in tlie cheeks nearly to the ears. IIYPEETKOPnr. The skin of the cheeks and lips may be hypertrophied in connection with elephantiasis of the face. There may be a thickening of the lips alone, so that they ap- pear double. This thickening may be due to an increase of all the anatomical elements of the lips; or there may be an in- crease and dilatation of the lymphatic vessels, giving to the growth a soft, oedematous character.

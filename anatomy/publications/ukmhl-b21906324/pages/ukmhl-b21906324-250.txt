POST-MORTEir EXAMINATIONS. 240 aponeuroses, and skin are forced outward to form a sac, in wliicli the uterus is placed. Crural hernise are produced by tlie drawing down of tlie uterus and ovaries into the sac of an intestinal hernia. Inguinal hernia is produced in the same way, or is congenital. Ischiadic hernia has been seen in one case. Pregnancy may occur in the uterus while situated in a cru- ral or inguinal hernia. KUPTUEE PEKFORATION. Rupture of the unimpregnated uterus is rare. It may, how- ever, occur when the uterine cavity is distended with blood or serum, or in connection with large myomata of the uterine walls. In the gravid uterus, ruptures have been seen in nearly every mouth of pregnancy. The rupture may be produced by thin- ning of the uterine wall by tumors, or by violent contusions. The act of parturition is the most frequent cause. Malposi- tions of the ftetus, narrowing of the pelvis, long protracted labor, thinning of the uterine wall from tumors, forcible use of the forceps and other instruments are the ordinary causes. The rupture may be in the body of the uterus or the cervix ; it may be large or small; it may extend completely or only partly tlirough the uterine wall. The consequences of partial rupture are haemorrliage, gangrenous inflammation of the edges of the rapture, peritonitis, and usually deatli. In rare cases, the rup- ture cicatrizes, and the patient recovers. Complete rupture usually causes death in a short time. The fcetus escapes partly or completely into the abdominal cavity. If the patient sur- vives the immediate shock, fatal peritonitis soon ensues. In rare cases, the foetus is shut in by adhesions, and the patient survives. Perforations of the uterus may be produced by carcinoma, by abscesses in its neighborliood, and by ovarian cysts.

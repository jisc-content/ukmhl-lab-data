THE EESPIRATOEY SYSTEM. THE LAEYNX. MALFORMATIONS. The larynx may be entirely absent in aceplialons, and other monsters. It may be abnormally large, or abnormally small. The epiglottis may be larger or smaller than the normal stan- 'dard, or may be cleft. Portions of the cartilages of the larynx may be absent or defective. INFLAMMATION". Acute Catarrhal Laryngitis causes the mucous membrane to appear congested, swollen, and soft. Its surface is thinly coated with muco-pus. The mucous glands are swollen with their increased secretion. The submucous connective tissue is more or less infiltrated with serum. Chronic Catarrhal Laryngitis causes the mucous membrane to appear grayish and soft. The mucous follicles are swollen and prominent. The submucous tissue is thickened. Tlie sur- face may be covered with muco-pus, and there are often small idcerations. Sometimes the inflammation extends to the peri- chondrium of the cartilages. Croupous Laryngitis occurs as the " croup" of children, with diphtheria, pyaemia, typhus fever, and other severe, acute diseases, and from the inhalation of irritating substances and gases. We find the mucous membrane covered by a layer of yellowish-white, consistent materialâ€”false membrane. This layer consists of fibrine and lymphoid cells ; it dips down into the mouths of the mucous follicles, and may be found also in

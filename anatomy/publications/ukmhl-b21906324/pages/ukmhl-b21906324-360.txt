POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 350 STRYCHNIA.â€”NUX VOMICA. We possess very few good records of post-mortem examina- tions after death from these poisons. The contraction of the muscles, which exists during Kfe, disappears after death. Tliere may be excessive congestion of the membranes of the brain. Casper mentions a peculiar violet color of the muscles of the pharynx and oesophagus. Otherwise there are no lesions. CONIUM, ACONITE, BELLADONNA, LOBELIA INFLATA, DIGITALIS, STRAMONIUM, VERATRUM. These vegetable poisons are administered in their natural form of leaves, berries, and roots, or in tinctures, infusions, and extracts, or in the form of their active alkaloid principles. If the leaves, berries, or seeds are given, they may be de- tected in the contents of the stomach by microscopic examina- tion. Otherwise the results of autopsies are unreliable. The brain and its membranes, and the lungs, may be con- gested. The stomach may present patches of congestion, in- flammation, and extravasation, or its entire mucous coat may be inflamed, or it may appear normal. GAEBONIO OXIDE. This gas is produced from burning charcoal, and forms the poisonous ingredient of illuminating gas. It is usually used as a poison in one of these forms. The most characteristic post-mortem appearance is that of the blood, which is of a brilliant red color. The muscles and viscera also appear red from the color of the blood in them. The viscera present the same changes as in death from suffo- cation. GAItBOLIC ACID. A number of cases of death from this poison have been re- ported during the last few years. It acts as a corrosive poison on the mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, producing white eschars with intense congestion. The lungs are usually intensely congested.

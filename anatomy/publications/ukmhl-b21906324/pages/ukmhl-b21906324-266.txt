MALFORJIATIOXS. Absence of both tubes occurs with absence of the uterus. One tube may be absent, with arrested development of the cor- responding side of the uterus. Both tubes may be imperfectly developed, either of their ends may be closed, they may be in- serted into tlie uterus at an abnormal place, they may terminate in two or three abdominal ostia. CHANGES IX SIZE. Dilatation of the tubes, with increase of their length, is pro- duced by the accumulation of catarrhal secretion, or by a con- striction of some portion of the tube. Narrowing of the tubes is produced by inflammation or by masses of mucus, blood, or pus. The abdominal end may be bound down and closed by adhesions, or the uterine end may be closed. In old age, the lumen of the tabes becomes very small or is obliterated. Rupti^re of a dilated tube sometimes takes place. H^MOEEIIAGE.

POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 230 INFLAMMATION. The skin, mucous membrane, connective tissue, and glands of the vulva may be the seat of inflammation. Chronic catarrhal inflammation may produce a thickening and papillary hypertrophy of the cutis, with a moist ulcerating sur- face. Erysipelatous inflammation of the skin of the vulva is frequent in young children, and may cause death. In adults, it is less common. Acute oedema of the labia majora occurs in pregnant and puerperal women. It may terminate in gangrene or in suppu- ration. Inflammation of the vulvo-vaginal glands may be acute, and produce abscesses ; or chronic, and produce induration of the gland. Gangrene may follow erysipelatous inflammation, may oc- cur after parturition, may accompany severe and exhausting diseases, and may occur as an epidemic disease, especially among children. Herpes, Eczema, Lichen, Prurigo, etc., may be found on the skin of the vulva. NEW GROWTHS. Fibroma.—Fibroma difi'usum (elephantiasis) is found growing from the clitoris, the nymphse, and the labia majora. It ap- pears as a diffused hypertrophy of the parts, with a smooth or warty surface ; or as a polypoid growth with a narrow pedicle. In either case the structure is the same. If the skin remains smooth, its outer layers are but little changed ; if it is rough, the papillfe are hypertrophied. The new growth arises from the deep layers of the cutis, and consists of a loose connective tissue infiltrated with serum. The tumors may reach a very large size. Fibroma Papillare, Papilloma.—These tumors vary from the size of a pea to that of an apple. They present a rougli, cauli- flower-looking appearance. They are composed of papillai or tufts, with a central stroma of connective tissue and blood-ves- sels and a thick covering of epithelium.

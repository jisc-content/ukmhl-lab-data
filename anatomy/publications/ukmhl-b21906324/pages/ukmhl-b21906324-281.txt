THE MAMMA. 271 formed by an emulsion of these fat globules in serum. In old age, after the menses have ceased, the epithelium atrophies, the acini collapse, and finally we find nothing but a mass of fibrous tissue and fat, in which are imbedded the ducts of the gland. In the male, the mammary gland remains undeveloped through life. It consists of a few ducts and acini imbedded in connective tissue. MALFORMATIONS. Absence of both mammse is only found in connection with other marked malformations. Absence of one mamma has been observed in a few cases, with and without defective development of the corresponding half of the thorax. Absence of one or of both nipples is more common. Arrest of development of the mammse is found in connec- tion with arrest of development of the organs of generation, and, to a less degree, alone. Supernumerary mammte and nipples have been observed in a number of cases. The glands may all secrete milk during lactation. Too early development of the mammae is sometimes found in young children in connection with abnormal development of the organs of generation. LNFLAMMATION. The nipple, during lactation, is often the seat of cracks or fissures of the skin, sometimes complicated with inflammation. Syphilitic ulcers may occur on the nipple in the form of primary chancres and secondary mucous patches. Chronic eczema is found affecting the skin of the nipple. Erysipelatous inflammation of the skin over the mamma may have its origin in the fissures of the nipples, or in un- known causes. Acute inflammation of the mamma occurs during lactation.

It is deposited both in the tubes and in the intertubular tissue, in the form of acicular crystals. Concretions of the urinary salts of all sizes and shapes, and in indefinite numbers, may be formed in the calyces and pelvis of the kidney. They may pass through the ureter into the bladder ; or cause hydro-nephrosis, or pyelo-nephritis. NEW GKOWTHS. Fibroma.—Small, hard, wliite, fibrous nodules are frequently found in the pja-amids. The kidneys are normal, or the seat of diffuse nephritis. Myxoma.—Small nodules of mucous tissue are sometimes found in yramids. Large tumors may grow from the pel- vis of the kidney. They are usually a combination of myxoma, lipoma, and sarcoma. Lipoma.—There may be a diffused increase of fatty tissue around the capsule of the kidney ; and in atrophied kidneys an increase of fat about their pelves. Small, rounded, or lobu- lated, fatty tumors are occasionally found in the cortex, just beneath the capsule. Ttibercles.—With general tuberculosis we often find small, miliary, gray, or cheesy granulations scattered through the kidney. Besides this condition, there is another change in the kidney, which is generally called tubercle, but of which the real nature is somewhat doubtful. First the papilla?, and afterward the rest of the pyramids and the cortex, are converted into a yellow, cheesy mass, of firm or soft consistence. The entire kidney tissue may be destroyed in this way. The pelvis and the ureter are usually coated with a thick layer of the same cheesy mate- rial. Similar changes in the bladder, vesiculre seminales, testicle, prostate, uterus, and Fallopian tubes often exist in the same patient. The lesion is usually seen at such an advanced stage that nothing but the cheesy degeneration can be found. It is said that this condition is preceded by the formation of miliary

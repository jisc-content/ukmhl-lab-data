Such a hepatitis may assume the ordinary characters of nodular cirrho- sis of the liver, or it may assume a form which is peculiar and different from this. The difference consists merely in the dis- tribution of the new fibrous tissue. Instead of surrounding sin- gle acini, or small groups, the new connective tissue surrounds larger portions of the organ, and thus gives it a lobulated in- stead of a nodulated form. There is at the same time perilie- patitis, with thickening of the capsule ; and from the thicken- ed capsule dense fibrous septa extend into the liver. A lobe of the liver may be, in this way, divided up into two or more large subdivisions, or into a great number of small lobules. There are also, in some cases, gummy tumors formed in the fibrous septa. In other cases, the lobiilation is less marked, but we find smooth, hard masses of fibrous tissue replacing portions of the hepatic tissue. DEGENERATIONS OF THE LIVER. THE FATTY LIVEK. In the human liver there is usually a certain amount of fat in the liver-cells, and this amount varies considerably under dif- ferent conditions, without constituting a pathological lesion. The amount of fat in the liver-cells, and the extent to which it is distributed, may, however, reach such an extent as to be entire- ly abnormal The fat is found in the hepatic cells, in the form of globules of different sizes. A single cell may contain several small fat globules, or may be so distended with fat that only a narrow rim of cell-tissue is left. The accumulation of fat usually be- gins in the periphery of each acinus, next to the branches of the portal vein. The gross appearance of the organ varies a good deal in different cases. It is usually increased in size, flattened,

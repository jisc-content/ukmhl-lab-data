DEATH FROM LIGHTNING. Persons wbo are struck by lightning may die instantly ; or may continue for several hours comatose, or delirious, and then either die or recover; or they may die after some time from the efi^ects of the burns and injuries received. The post-mortem appearances are very variable. Sometimes there are no marks of external violence. Sometimes the clothes are burnt and torn, while the skin beneath them is unchanged. Usually there are marks of contusion and laceration, or ecchy- moses, or lacerated, punctured v^ounds, or fractures of the bones, or superficial or deep burns. The track of the electric fluid may be marked by dark-red streaks on the skin. The internal viscera may be lacerated and disorganized in the same way.

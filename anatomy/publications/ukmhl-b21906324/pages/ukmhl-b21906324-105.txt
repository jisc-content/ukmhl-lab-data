THE YASOULAR SYSTEM. THE PERICARDIUM. TNIALFOKMATIOISrS. The pericardium may be absent, when there is ectopia of the heart. Cases have been observed in which the heart and the lung were situated in the left pleural cavity, with only rudi- ments of the parietal pericardium at the base of the heart. INJURIES. The pericardium may be wounded by penetrating weapons, by gunshot wounds, and by fragments of bone. It may be ruptured by severe contusions of the thorax, and by rapid extravasation of blood into the pericardial sac. Perforations may be produced by empyema, by mediastinal abscesses, by abscesses of the chest-wall and of the liver, by aneurisms of the aorta, and by suppurative inflammation of the pericardium. DKOPSY. In most post-mortems, we find a little serum, from | ounce to 1 ounce, in the pericardial sac. This serum is usually clear and of a light yellow color; if decomposition has commenced, it may be of a reddish color, or it may be slightly turbid from the falling off of the pericardial epithelium. Large accumulations of serum are found as part of general dropsy from heart-disease, kidney-disease, etc. The serum is clear and of a light yellow color. Hydro-pericardium is usually moderate in comparison with the accumulations of serum in the other serous cavities; sometimes, however, there is a very large

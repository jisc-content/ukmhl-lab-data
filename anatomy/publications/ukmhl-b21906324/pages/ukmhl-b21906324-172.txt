The ordinary fecal contents of the small and large intestines are, in inflammation, mixed with serum, epithelium, mucus, and blood. Blood in the intestines, from whatever source it is derived, when recent, is still red and coagulated. After a longer stay in the intestines, it becomes converted into a black, granular mass. Concretions are formed either of hard, dry, ftecal masses, or of mucus mixed with dried fseces, or collected around a foreign body, and impregnated with salts of lime. Such concretions are usually small, but may reach the size of a man's fist. They are round, oval, laminated, angular, or of irregular shape. They are found to consist of mucus, bile, fiscal matter, carl)on- ate and phosphate of lime, and triple phosphate. They may give rise to no evil efiects, or may cause inflammation, ulcera- tion, and perforation, especially of the appendix vermiformis. Sometimes the ulcerative process stops, and the concretion is left attached to the mucous membrane by membranous adhe- sions. Foreign bodies of every variety may be swallowed, and pro- duce different eftects in the intestines, according to their nature. PAKASrrES. Ascaris lumbricoides is found in the small intestine, either singly or in numbers. In rare cases, a number of worms may form a mass, which produces inflammation, ulceration, and per- foration. Oxyuris vcrmicularls is found in large numbers in the rec- tum. Tricocephalus disbar is found in the caecum. Atikylostomxim duodenale is found in the duodenum, and may give rise to considerable haMuorrhages. Trichina sj^indis is found in its adult condition in the small intestine.

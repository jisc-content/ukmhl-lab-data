The atrophy may reach such a degree that tlie gland can no longer be distinguished with the naked eye. This extreme degree of atrophy is sometimes found in diabetes. A moderate degree of atrophy seems to be a regular senile change. INFLAMMATION. Suppurative Inflammation of the pancreas is very rare. The organ is found infiltrated with pus, or contains abscesses, or is surrounded by pus. The collections of pus thus formed may spread into the neighboring soft parts, and perforate into the abdominal cavity, the stomach, or the intestines. Some of the cases described as abscesses seem to be cysts with purulent contents. The recorded cases of suppurative inflam- mation of the pancreas are so few that hardly any thing is known of its cause. Chronic Interstitial Inflammation of the pancreas results in the production of new fibrous tissue, with induration and sub- sequent atrophy of the organ. Tlie contraction of the new fibrous tissue may obliterate the pancreatic duets, and may also compress the ductus communis choledochus, so as to produce icterus and even dilatation of the bile-ducts. DEGENEKATION. Wojxy Degeneration affects, in rare cases, tlie blood-vessels of the pancreas ; tlie gland-cells are not involved. NEW GROWTHS. Carcinoma of the pancreas is not common. It occurs both as a primary and secondary growth. As a primary growth, it usually takes the form of hard, fibrous nodules scattered through the glands, or of a uniform, scirrhous enlargement; more rarely, colloid cancer and cylindrical-celled epithelial cancer have been observed. The new growth is con-

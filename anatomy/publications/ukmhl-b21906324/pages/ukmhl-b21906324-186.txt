POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 176 in the hepatic tissue, or in the form of a diffused haeniorrhagic softening. If tlie extravasation is small, it may be absorbed, leaving a cicatrix. According to Stokes, such htemorrliages may produce gangrene of the liver. INFLAMMATION. The liver is often the seat of inflammatory changes. These changes affect the capsule of the organ, its interstitial connec- tive tissue, or its cells; they involve either a portion or the whole of the liver. PERIHEPATITIS. The capsule of the liver and its prolongations along the ves- sels are frequently inflamed. The inflammation may be part of a general peritonitis, or may be confined to the liver. When the inflammation is confined to the liver, it is depen- dent upon the different forms of hepatitis; upon new growths and hydatids of the liver ; upon pleurisy of the right side ; upon syphilis ; rarely upon traumatic causes ; and very frequently occurs without any assignable cause or previous symptoms. Perihepatitis usually results in thickening of the capsule and the formation of membranous adhesions. These lesions are usually of little consequence, and frequently give rise to no symptoms during life. In some cases, however, the entire cap sule is very much thickened, the liver is small and compressed, and the synqjtoms are those of cirrhosis. In rare cases perihepatitis is purulent, and produces collec- tions of pus shut in by false membranes. The inflammation of the prolongations of the capsule on the vessels will be considered with diseases of the vessels. CHRONIC PARENCHYMATOUS HEPATITIS. Fcirster describes, under this name, a lesion which he says is usually confounded with cirrhosis. The liver is at first large, congested, or antemic. Following the stage of hypertrophy, a gradual, slow atrophy sets in. The organ is small, anfemic, yellow, and has a granular a]ipearance. This granular a])pearance, however, is not like that of cirrhosis,

THE BRAIN. 59 CEDEMA, Infiltration of tlie brain witli serum occurs as a consequence of clironic diseases—chronic nephritis, phthisis, etc.—and oc- cin-s with cardiac disease and obstruction of the jugular veins. Usually the amount of serum is small; the brain substance appears moist, and exudes a little serum on pressure. Some- times, however, the serum is very abundant, and the brain ap- pears almost semi-fluid. CEdema, with anasmia of the brain, is considered by Traube to be the cause of urjemic convulsions. MELAN^ML\. In persons affected by malarial disease, the gray matter of the brain is sometimes found to have a blackish tint. This color is due to the presence of black pigment granules within the capillary vessels. The obstruction to the vessels by these pigment masses may cause capillary apoplexies. The pigment is also found within the capillaries of the pia mater. Some authors hold that the pigment is situated in the walls of the vessels. It has always ajDpeared to me to be within them. NEW GROWTHS. Carcinoma occurs in the brain as a primary or secondary tumor. It may be of the hard or soft varieties, or cavernous, or melanotic. It is found in all parts of the brain, and may be single or multiple. It may increase so as to involve the dura mater and skull, and appear on the outside of the cranixim. Sarcoma is usually found in the hemispheres. The tumors may be hard and fibrous, or soft, or vascular, or cheesy. They are composed of round, oval, or fusiform cells, with a connec- tive tissue stroma. Glioma.—Under this name Yirchow describes a form of tumor composed of neuroglia. The typical growths are composed of a finely granular substance, in which nuclei are obscurely seen. They are either hard, or soft, or lijemon-hagic. They frequent- ly appear like a hypertrophy of the brain tissue rather than a tumor.

226 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. Tlie stricture may be temporary, produced by a diifused in- flammatory swelling of the miicons membrane, or by the raising of the relaxed membrane into a fold or pocket. Permanent strictures are produced by structural changes in the walls of the urethra. (1.) The mucous membrane and sub-mucous tissue is left hard and imyielding by the preceding inflammation. Subsequently, the new fibrous tissi;e contracts and narrows the canal. (2.) Ulceration of the mucous membrane leaves cicatricial tissue, which contracts, and also produces adhesions and bands of fibrous tissue. (3.) There is fibrous induration of the corpus spongiosum, and consequent Constriction of the m-ethra. The most frequent position of strictures is at the junction of the membranous and spongy portions of the urethra, or close to this point. They also occur at the fossa navicularis and the meatus, but frequently in the prostatic portion. There may be one stricture or several. The consequences of stricture are dilatation of the urethra, the bladder, the ureters, and hydronephrosis ; inflammation and ulceration of the urethra behind the stricture, with perforation, infiltration of m-ine, or the formation of fistulte. The urethra may also be obstructed by folds of the mucous membrane; by muscular valves at the neck of the bladder ; by wounds; by polypi and swollen glands; by new growths; by changes in the prostate and perineum; by calculi, mucus, blood, and echinococci coming from the bladder; by foreign bodies introduced from without. Prolapse and inversion of the mucous membrane is seen in young girls and women in rare cases. Tliere is a bluish, red swelling, from the size of a pea to that of a walnut, at the mea- tus. In the male, invagination of the mucous membrane of tlie urethra has been seen after injuries of the perineum. WOUNDS, KUPTUKE, PEKFOEATION. Wounds of the urethra are produced in many ways, but most commonly by catheters and bougies. The wounds may cicatrize,

102 POST-MORTEM EXA^IINATIO^TS. Serous infiltration of tlie heart-wall, from pericarditis ; nij-ocar- ditis; fatty degeneration of the muscular fibres; and atrophy of the muscle, from chronic diseases, may all lead to dilatation. (3.) A heart which is already hypertrophied may, from de- generation of the heart-wall, become dilated. (4.) Acute infiltrations of the lungs, and acute pleuritic ex- udations, by rendering a large number of vessels suddenly im- permeable to the blood current, produce a rapid stasis in the pulmonary artery and dilatation of the right heart. ATROPHY. Atrophy of the walls of the heart may be accompanied with no change in the size of its cavities; or with dilatation, (the same as passive dilatation ;) or, more frequently, with diminution in the size of the cavities. The atrophy involves most frequently all the cavities of the heart, but may be confined to one or more of them. The muscular tissue appears normal, or brown from the pre- sence of little granules of pigment in the muscular fibres ; or the muscular fibres may undergo fatty degeneration ; or there may be an abnormal accumulation of fat beneath the pericar- diimi; or there may be a peculiar gelatinous material beneath the pericardium; this consists of fat which has undergone mu- cous degeneration. The causes of atrophy of the heart are: (1.) It is a congenital malformation ; the heart of an adult then looks like that of an infant. (2.) Any chronic and exhausting disease, repeated haimor- rhages, old age, typhus fever, dysentery, etc., may produce atro- (3.) Chronic pericarditis, with large serous effusion, or with thickening of the epicardium, producing constriction of the coronary arteries. (4.) Stenosis, atheroma, calcification, or thrombosis of the coronary arteries, may produce partial or total atroph\\ (5.) Myocarditis, with fatty or fibrous degeneration. (0.) Mitral stenosis may cause atrophy of the left ventricle.

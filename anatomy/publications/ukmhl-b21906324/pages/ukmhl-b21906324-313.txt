PYAEMIA Under the name of pysemia are commonly understood seve- ral different conditions, giving rise to different lesions. (1.) Septiecemia.—Some portion of the body is in a condition of gangrene. That is, the tissues are not only dead, but de- composing, with the evolution of gases, the softening and lique- faction of the solid parts, and the development of minute or- ganisms, either animal or vegetable. The gangrenous fluids thus produced are, apparently, absorb- ed by the lymphatics and blood-vessels, and are thus able to produce marked symptoms during life, and to cause death. As in tj'phus fever, and other general diseases, hardly any lesions of the viscera ai*e found, and the changes in the fluids have as yet escaped observation. The bodies of persons, who have died from septicaemia, de- compose with unusual rapidity. The endocardium and inner coat of the vessels are often stained with the coloring matter of the blood. The viscera are soft and flabby. The spleen may be swollen. The kidneys may be congested, their epithelium degenerated. (2.) Simple Pycemia.—Persons who have suppurating wounds or abscesses may, without much change in the wound or ab- scess, be seized with rigors followed by fever, become jaundiced and die. In such persons, after death, no more lesions may be foimd than in septicaemia. The same tendency to decomposition, flabbiness of the viscera, and congestion of the spleen and kid- neys is found. Less frequently there may be purulent inflammation of the serous and synovial membranes, and of the connective tissue. Suppurative pleurisy, pericarditis, peritonitis, synovitis, and abscesses in the connective tissue may be found. Nor is there any way of accounting for these except by supposing that the pus from the original wound or abscess in some way infects the

90 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. THE PLEURA. IIYDKDTHOEAX. N'on-inflammatory exudations of serum into the pleiiral cavi- ties accompany tlie various diseases wliiclr cause general hydre- mia. A small amount of serum, either clear or bloody, is often found as a mere post-mortem change. All chronic and exhausting diseases, renal disease, cardiac dis- ease, and cirrhosis, are very often attended with hydrothorax. The fluid is a clear serum, sometimes yellow, which may reach such an amount as to compress the greater part of the lung. H^MOEKHAGE. Small, dark-red extravasations in the pleura are found with purpura, death by suffocation, and in the lungs of young chil- dren. Haemorrhages into the cavity of the pleura are caused by the rupture of aneurisms, by the rupture of the pericardium previously distended with blood, and by wounds of the chest- walL INFLAJOIATION. Pleurisy occurs as a primary disease, or from inflammation of the lung tissue, or from perforation of the chest by wounds, by abscesses of the wall of the thorax, of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and aroimd carious vertebrse. It occurs also without perforation with perihepatitis and perisplenitis. Pyoemia and puerperal fever also often cause pleurisy. Inflammation of the pleura is attended with exudation of se- rum, fibrine, lymphoid cells, and sometimes with extravasation of blood. The amoiint of these different substances varies in different cases. (1.) There may be a scanty exudation of fibrine alone. The surface of the pleura is found coated Avith a thin, membranous, grayish layer, consisting of fibrine entangling a few lymphoid cells. This may be entirely absorbed, or it may cause perma- nent adliesions between pulmonary and costal pleura, or be- tween the difterent lobes. The adhesions are most frequently

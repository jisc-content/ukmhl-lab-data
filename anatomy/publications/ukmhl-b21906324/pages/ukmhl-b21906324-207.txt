197 THE LIVEE. may contain bile, mucus, or calculi. The liver is at first en- larged, but may afterward atrophy. The gall-bladder may be dilated in consequence of obstruc- tion of the common or the cystic ducts. In the latter case, it may reach an immense size, and form a large tumor in the ab- dominal cavity. The dilatation is generally uniform, the blad- der retaining its normal form; sometimes, however, there are diverticula, which are usually produced by calculi. If the obstruction to the hepatic duct is incomplete or mov- able, the gall-bladder contains bile, and often calculi. If the obstruction is complete, the contained fluid gradually loses its biliary character, and becomes a serous or mucous fluid of a light yellow color. The walls of the bladder may be of normal thickness, or thinned, or thickened, or calcified. If the obstruction is due to a calculus, this may pass into the intestine and the gall-bladder be suddenly emptied. Usually, the bladder fills again, owing to its loss of contractile power. NEW GROWTHS. Fibroma has been observed in rare cases in the gall-bladder and in the common duct. Carcinoma occurs both as a secondary and a primary growth. It is more frequent in the gall-bladder than in the bile-ducts. Simple cancer, villous, cylindrical, epithelial, and colloid cancer have all been observed in this situation. BILIAKY CALCULI. These bodies are of common occurrence. They are found usually in the bladder; sometimes in the hepatic, cystic, and common ducts ; least frequently in the small ducts in the liver. In the gall-bladder from one to 7800 calculi have been counted. They are composed : 1. Principally of cholesterine. They are round, oval, or faceted, single or multiple, of a pure white color, or tinged in various shades by bile-pigment.

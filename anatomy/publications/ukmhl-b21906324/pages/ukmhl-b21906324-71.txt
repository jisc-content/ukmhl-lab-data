THE SPINAL CORD. 61 THE PnuiTAKY BODY. The pituitary body is sometimes entirely absent, or it may be atrophied and fatty. Small abscesses have been observed in it. Colloid degeneration may affect it, sometimes with hyper- trophy. Carcinoma and Tubercle may occur in it. THE PINEAL GLAND. This little body may be entirely wanting, or hypertrophied, or contain pus, or be changed into a cyst, or be enlarged and filled with globular concretions of lime. Forster reports a sin- gle case of secondary Carcinoma in it. THE SPINAL COED. THE MEMBRANES. THE DURA MATER. Inflammation of the dura mater is very infrequent. It is only found M^th injuries, or disease of the vertebrae. The in- flammation is usually of suppurative character, and may com- press the spinal cord or cause a general meningitis. NEW GKOWTHS. Bone of new formation in the dura mater is rare, and forms small plates. Lipoma has been observed in several cases. Tttberde usually accompanies caries of the vertebrae in the shape of a diffused, cheesy infiltration, with softening and the formation of abscesses between the pia and dura maters. More rarely, isolated tubercles are found without disease of the bone. Carcinoma of the dura mater may be primary, or continuous from the vertebrae. It is medullary, grows inward and com- presses the cord, or outward, and infiltrates the soft parts out- side the vertebrae. THE PIA MATER. The pia mater of the cord, like that of the brain, is found in various degrees of congestion, and it is difficult to pronounce how great a degree is pathological.

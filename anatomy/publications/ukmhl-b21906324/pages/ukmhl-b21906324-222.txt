POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 212 explain this by the presence of fungi, bacteria, wliich find their way lip the ureters, and into the kidney-tissue. The lesions of the kidney are marked. The organ is some- what swollen. On its surface, in the cortex, and in the pyra- mids, we find small white spots, surrounded by red zones of con- gestion. These spots may be from the size of a pin's head to that of a third of the kidney. They may be firm, or soft and purulent. The larger spots are usually purulent. The entire kidney may thus l)e converted into a bag of pus and broken- down tissue. The minute change consists in an accumulation of lymphoid cells in the intertubular tissue, with degenerative changes in the tubes. PerinejpTiritis. As a very rare occurrence, we sometimes find small collec- tions of pus between the capsule and the kidney, apparently produced by infiammation of the capsule. More frequently we find the products of inflammation out- side the capsule. There may be, as the result of perinephritis, a mass of dense fibrous tissue surrounding the organ ; or, more frequently, a collection of pus. These abscesses may open in- to the peritoneal cavity, into the intestine, or burrow in the muscles of the back, and open externally. Perinephritis may be produced by blows on the lumbar re- gion ; by pyelitis and pyelo-nepliritis ; by abscesses in the psoas muscles; by abscesses in the pelvic cavity, and occi;r as an idiopathic inflammatioii after exposure to cold, and with typhus and other severe diseases. DEGENERATIONS. Chronic Parenchymatous Degeneration. This disease is also known imder the names of catarrhal ne- phritis, parenchymatous inflammation, granular degeneration, fatty degeneration. It is found, not as a primary disease, but as a result of pro-

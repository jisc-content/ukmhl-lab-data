305 THROMBOSIS AND EMBOLISM. THROMBOSIS AND EMBOLISM. A thrombus is a clot, composed principally of the fibrin e of the blood, formed dm'ing life in the cavities of the heart, the arteries, the veins, or the capillaries. An embolus is a solid body, usually a portion of a thrombus, carried by the blood-current into some artery or capillary, and becoming fixed there. A thrombus may entirely fill the cavity of a vessel; or it may only form a layer on its wall; or it may project from a smaller vessel into a larger one. An embolus may completely, or only partly, plug up a vessel. It may remain alone, or a thrombus may be formed around it. A thrombus may mei'ely become harder and whiter with time; or it may become organized ; or it may degenerate, soften, and change into a mass of puriform fluid and gangrenous-look- ing fibrine ; or it may calcify. The production of thrombi is due to various causes. (1.) Spontaneous thrombi are produced by any cause which seriously weakens the whole system, as old age and chronic ex- hausting diseases. They are usually formed in the veins of the. lower limbs and pelvis, and in the sinuses of the dura mater. (2.) Compression of the vessels by ligatures, tumors, dislocated' bones, and inflammatory exudation. Pneumonia may produceâ–  thrombosis of the pulmonary veins. Phthisis may produce thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries. (3.) Dilatation of the vessels, as in aneurisms and varicose veins. (4.) Thrombi may form in capillaries or small veins, and in- crease until they project into larger veins. (5.) Inflammation, especially of a gangrenous and suppura- tive natui-e, in the soft parts around a vessel. (6.) Degenerative and inflammatory changes in the wall of a vessel. In the arteries and capillaries, fatty degeneration and endarteritis may render the inner coat rough. The veins may become inflamed in consequence of inflammation of the sur- rounding soft pai'ts, or of wounds of their walls. The inflam-- 20

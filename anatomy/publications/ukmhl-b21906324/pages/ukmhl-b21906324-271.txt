261 THE PENIS. ETFLAMMATION. JBalanitis, inflammation of the prepuce, is usually produced by gonorrhoea, or by accumulations of smegma. The skin is red and swollen, and may ulcerate. Condylomata may be formed, and adhesions between the prepuce and glans. The glans may ulcerate and the prepuce may be much thickened. If the prepuce is long, there is an inflammatory phymosis, and the products of inflammation accumulate within the swollen pre- puce. In some cases, the prepuce becomes gangrenous. Parwphymosis is produced by the retraction of a narrow prepuce behind the glans, with consequent stricture, inflamma- tion, and gangrene. Inflammation of the Corpora Cavernosa is produced by gon- orrhoea, injuries, fistulse, typhus fever, measles, and occurs in connection with inflammation of the connective tissue of the pelvis. It results in fibrous induration of portions of the cor- pora cavernosa; in rare cases, in abscesses or diffuse purulent infiltration ; sometimes in gangrene. Syphilitic Ulcers frequently occur on the glans penis and prepuce. The indurated chancre is formed either from an excoriation in which a pustule is formed, or from a little nodule. The pus- tule breaks and its walls are infiltrated with small, round cells. The nodule softens, breaks down, and forms an ulcer, of which the walls are infiltrated with cells in the same way. Phagedsenic ulcers occur, and may destroy a considerable part of the penis. Herpes of the prepuce ocGurs in the form of small vesicles, which may later become ulcers. Erysipelatous and furuncular inflammation sometimes in- volve the skin of the penis. NEW GROWTHS. Papilloma is found on the prepuce and glans penis. It oc- curs in the form of little warty growths, or of composite, cauli- flower masses, even as large as a fist. In either case, the struc-

73 THE BRONCHI. The walls of these bronchiectasife are found in various morbid conditions, but usually preserve something of their normal structure. (1.) The wall is simply swollen and relaxed. This condition is most frequent in the dilatations caused by bronchitis in chil- dren. As the bronchitis subsides, these dilatations may disap- pear. (2.) The wall is hypertrophied. The mucous membrane is thickened, and may be covered with little papillary outgrowths. The submucous tissue, mucous glands, and cartilage may also be hypertrophied. (3.) The wall is atrophied, and the thinning may be so ad- vanced as to leave nothing but an attenuated, semi-transparent mucous membrane. (â– Jr.) The wall is trabeculated. The surface is no longer smooth, but is divided up by bands crossing each other, and leaving little depressions between them. These bands are the longitudinal and circular fibrous bands of the normal bronchi. The cartilages are usually thickened. (5.) They may ulcerate, and this ulceration may extend to the lung tissue, so as to form cavities, which are partly bron- chiectasiae, and partly formed by the destruction of lung tissue. (6.) The bronchus leading to a dilatation ma}' become entire- ly obliterated, and leave a cyst with smooth walls and serous contents. (7.) Tlie walls may become calcified, or inflamed, or gan- grenous. The lung tissue will be found altered in various ways, and these alterations either jjrecede, or follow, or are complications of the dilatations. (1.) The lung tissue is in a condition of fibrous induration. This fibrous induration may precede and cause the dilatations, or may be with them the I'esult of chronic inflamniation. (2.) The ectasise may give rise to lobular pneumonia and con- gestion. The lobules affected by pneumonia maybe in the con- dition of red and gray hepatization, or may become gangrenous. (3.) A moderate degree of emphysema is a frequent concomi-

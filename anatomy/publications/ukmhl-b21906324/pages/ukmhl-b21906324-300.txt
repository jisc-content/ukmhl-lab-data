290 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. nothing left but a layer of periosteum and thin cartilage, filled with a soft mass of medulla, connective tissue, blood-vessels, and serum. In consequence of these changes, the bones become bent, completely and incompletely fractured, contracted and atro- phied. NEW GKOWTHS. Osteoma.—The bony tumors which grow from the bones are called exostoses or enostoses, according to their origin from the surface or interior of the bone. They may contain all the constituents of a nonnal bone: bone, medulla, vessels, periosteum, and cartilage. The new bone may be compact and like ivory, or spongy, or contain large cavities filled with medulla. The shape of the exostoses varies very miich. They may be in the form of sharp, narrow spiculge and processes ; they may have a polj^oid shape, with a narrow pedicle; they may form rounded tumors, with a broad base; or they may have more the character of an hyperostosis. The bone beneath them may be normal, or sclerosed, or rare- fied, or the medullary cavity of the bone may communicate with that of the exostosis. Exostoses are usually developed from the periosteum, some- times in the insertions of the tendons and muscles. A peculiar form is that called exostosis cartilaginea. It con- sists of a bony tumor covered with a thin layer of cartilage. Sometimes these growths are covered with a synovial sac, which may communicate with the cavity of a joint. They have a tendency to enlarge, and grow, lilce the long bones, from the inner layer of the cartilage which covers them. Enostoses are developed in the interior of bone from the medulla. They may increase in size until they project like an exostosis. Their most frequent situation is the bones of the cranium and face. Exostoses may be single or multiple, and may occur at all ages, even during intra-uterine life. Emhondroma.—Tumors composed of cartilage usually grow from the interior of the boues.

220 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. THE URINARY BLADDER. MALFORMATIONS. J^cstrophia, Extroversion, Inversion, Fissure of the Bladder is one of the most frequent malformations. It occurs in both sexes. (1.) The umbilicus is lower down than usual, the pubic bones are not united at the symphysis, the pelvis is wider and shal- lower than it should be. Between the umbilicus and pubes the abdominal wall is wanting. In its place is a projecting ovoid mass of mucous membrane, in which can be seen the openings of the ureters. The penis is usually rudimentary; the urethra is an open fissure, (epispadia;) the clitoris may be separated into two halves. The ureters usually open normally; sometimes their openings are displaced, or are multiple. They may be dilated. (2.) Vrolik describes a case in which there was a fissure in the abdominal wall, which was filled up by the perfectly formed bladder. (3.) The umbilicus may bo well formed, and there is a por- tion of abdominal wall between it and the extrophied bladder. (4r.) The external genitals and urethra may be well formed, and the symphysis pubis united, while only the bladder is fissured. (5.) The genitals, urethra, and symphysis may be Avell formed, the bladder closed, except at the upper part of its an- terior wall. The bladder is entirely or in part inverted and pushed through the opening in the abdominal wall. The Urachus normally remains as a very small canal, 5-7 centim. long, with a small opening into the bladder, or entirely closed at that point. If there is a congenital obstruction to the flow of urine through the urethra, the urachus may remain open, and the urine pass through it. Absence of the Bladder is very rare, and only described by the older authors. The bladder may be very small, and the urine pass almost directly into the urethra.

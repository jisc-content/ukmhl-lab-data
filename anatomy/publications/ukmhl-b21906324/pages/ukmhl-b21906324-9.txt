PREFACE. This work is intended to serve as a guide for those persons who may be called upon to perform post-mortem examinations. For most physicians this call is only an occasional one, so that they may feel the need of some hand-book to which they may refer. It is not proposed to offer a complete treatise on Pathological Anatomy, nor on Medical Jurisjjrudence, but rather a work which bears the same relation to them that a dissecting manual does to a complete Anatomy. The book is divided into four parts. The first gives the method of performing autopsies on the bodies of adults and of young chil- dren. The second gives in detail the lesions which have been ob- served in each organ of the body. The third gives the lesions which are found after deaths from general diseases, from violence, and from poisons. The fourth gives a short classification of tumors.

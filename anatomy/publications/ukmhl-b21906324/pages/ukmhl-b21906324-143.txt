133 THE PHARYNX AND THE (ESOPHAGUS. division of tlie middle portion of the oesopliagxas into two branches liave all been observed. INFLAMMATION. Catarrhal and Croupous Pharyngitis are usually associated with the same forms of inflammation in the mouth, and have the same characters. Submucous Pharyngitis may occur with, inflammations of the mucous membrane, with caries of the cervical vertebme, with inflammation of the cervical and parotid glands, with periostitis of the cranial bones, or may be idiopathic. It may result in swelling and oedema, in induration, or in suppuration. It is most important when it affects the posterior wall of the pha- rynx, and forms retro-pharyngeal abscesses. Such abscesses may cause death by suffocation. Catarrhal (Esophagitis may be either acute or chronic. The chronic form may produce ulceration, or relaxation and dilata- tion of the walls, or hypertrophy of the muscular coat. Croupous (Esophagitis is found witli croup of the pharynx, and after the exanthemata and other severe diseases. Irritating and caustic acids and alkalies destroy larger or smaller portions of the mucous membrane. The necrosed por- tions are of a black or whitish color, surrounded by a zone of intense congestion. If the patient recover, the patches of mem- brane which have been destroyed slough, fall off, and leave a granulating surface. In this way, dangerous stenosis of the oesophagus may be produced. Foreign bodies, which are swallowed and become fixed in the oesophagus, cause inflammation of the mucous membrane and of the adjoining soft parts. The inflammation may go on to produce abscesses around the oesophagus, or to destroy the wall of the canal, and the foreign body finds its way into the trachea, aorta, or pericardium. Inflammation of the submucous tissue of the oesophagus, apart from the cases just mentioned, is not common. It may cause the formation of abscesses, or of fibrous masses, which may produce stenosis.

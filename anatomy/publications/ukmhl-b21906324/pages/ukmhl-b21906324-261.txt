THE OVARIES. 251 cervix, beneatli the growth, we find alveoli filled with epithelial cells. True Carcinoma is not very common in the uteriis. The gross appearances resemble those of the more ordinary epithe- lial form of the growth. The tumor usually begins in the cervix, sometimes in the body of the uterus. It forms fungous masses projecting into the vagina, or growth and ulceration go on at the same time, or ulceration goes on faster than growth. Infection of the surrounding tissues is frequent; metastatic tumors often occur. Colloid Carcinoma is rare. It may involve the cervix or body. It has the ordinary S'tructure of a fibrous stroma form- ino; resrular alveoli, containing gelatinous matter and cells. oft / DO PARASITES. Echinococci have been observed in the body and neck of the uterus; they may rupture into the peritoneal cavity or into the vagina. THE OVARIES. MALFOEMATIONS. Both ovaries may be absent, the other organs of generation being also aljsent or undeveloped. Or the ovaries may be only partially developed. Absence or arrest of development of one ovary is sometimes met with in well-formed individuals. It is sometimes accom- panied by a low jDosition of the kidney on the same side. The ovaries may pass into the inguinal canal or into the labia majora, and remain fixed there through life. Less frequently they are found in the crural canal and the foramen ovale. CHANGES IlSr SZE. Atrophy is a regular senile change. The Graafian follicles disappear, and the organ shrivels into a small fibrous body. Atrophy is also produced by ascites, by chronic inflammation, or as an idiopathic change. True hypertrophy of the ovaries does not occur, but the stro- ma may be increased in amount.

154 POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. Besides this grave form of intussusception, we often find, es- pecially^ in children, one or more small invaginations not at- tended with congestion or inflammation. These are formed during the death-agony or immediately after death. PROLAPSUS. Prolapsus of the rectum consists in the protrusion of the lower part of the rectum through the anus. It begins as a slight,prolapse of a small part of the rectum, or of its mucous membrane, only occurring in the act of defecation. The pro- lapsed portion becomes gradually larger and larger ; it no lon- ger returns of itself ; it is constricted by the sphincter, becomes hyperfemic, swollen, and inflamed, so as to form a mass of large size. The lesser degrees of prolapse are common, especially in chil- dren, and are of little importance. The higher degrees may be- come the seat of severe inflammation and idceration, and, in rare cases, gangrene and death may supervene. Sometimes only the mucous membrane prolapses, and the prolapse may not involve the entire circumference of the rec- tum, but only one or more folds of the mucous membrane. TRANSPOSITION. The position of the intestines may be the opposite of that usually found. The transposition may afiect all the abdominal viscera ; the liver and caecum are on the left side, the stomach and spleen on the right side; or only a single viscus is trans- posed, WOUNDS, RUPTURE. Penetrating wounds of the intestine usually prove rapidly fa- tal fi'om the peritonitis which supervenes. Sometimes, how- ever, the wound is closed by the formation of adhesions with tlie neighboring parts. The intestine may then remain bound down by adhesions, or after a time become free. Sometimes the wound in the intestine becomes adherent at the position of the wound of the abdominal wall, and an intestinal fistula is formed.

DEATH FROM POISONING. 349 quently mistaken for meningitis. The dura mater is frequent- ly adherent to the skull. The pia mater is thickened and white, sometimes oedematous. The brain usually appears nor- mal. The lungs are usually congested. The heart is thickly covered with fat, and flabby. The stomach presents the lesions of chronic gastritis. The liver is fatty, cirrhosed, or both. The kidneys are in a condition of simple granular or fatty degeneration, or the seat of diffuse nephritis. CHLOEOFOEM. ETHEE. Chloroform may cause death when it is inhaled, and when it is taken in a fluid form into the stomach. Death from the inhalation of chloroform has become a tol- erably frequent accident in surgical practice. A very consi- derable number of post-mortem examinations of such cases have been recorded. They show that there is no constant or cha- racteristic lesion, nor is there any satisfactory explanation of the way in which such persons meet their death. Death from the swallowing of liquid chloroform is rare. Taylor gives a case in which a drachm killed a boy four years old. Adults can take with impunity a much larger quantity. I have seen one case in which four ounces proved fatal to a woman in a few hours. After death, there was a strong odor of chloroform when the stomach and duodenum were opened. The stomach was half full of undigested food. There were no lesions. Other cases are reported in which there was in- flammation of the stomach, and one case in which the liquid had passed into the larynx and trachea, producing intense in- flammation. Ether, given by inhalation, occasionally causes death. The post-mortem signs are negative. There is one death recorded by Casper, from its use in a fluid form. The cavities of the body exhaled a strong smell of ether; otherwise, there were no lesions.

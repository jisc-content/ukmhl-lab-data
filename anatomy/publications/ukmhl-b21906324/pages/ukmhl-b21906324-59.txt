THE EPENDYMA AND THE CHOROID PLEXUS. 49 Tuhercular Meningitis.â€”This form of meningitis accom- panies tlie production of gray miliary tubercles in the pia mater. The tubercles are found most abundant at the base and in the sulci, and are sometimes hardly to be seen with the naked eye. They are very small transparent granulations surrounding the small blood-vessels. They are formed by an accumulation of small round cells within the perivascular sheaths. Accompanying the tubercles, serum, hbrine, and lymphoid cells form a turbid fluid exudation beneath and in the pia mater. This form of inflammation is most frequent in childhood, but occurs also in adult life. It is usually found with tuberculosis of the other viscera. NEW GKOWTHS. Fibroma, Angioma, Sarcoma, Lipoma, Cysts, Carcinoma, and Epithelioma occur in the pia mater in rare cases. Gummy Tumors are found in and beneath the pia mater. Tumors formed of cholesterine and epithelial cells have been found at the base of the brain. Small plates of bone are sometimes formed in the pia mater over the convex surface of the brain. Tubercular tumors occur as rounded bodies, apparently form- ed of an aggregation of smaller tumors. They are usually far advanced in cheesy degeneration so as to liave an opaque yellow color. Tliey are most frequent in children. PAKASITES. The cysticercus cellulosse has been observed in the pia mater. THE YENTRICLES OF THE BRAIK THE EPENDYMA AND THE CHOROID PLEXUS. The ventricles usually contain a small amount of clear serum. If there is inflammation of the pia mater, especially at the base of the brain, turbid or purulent serum is frequently found in the ventricles. A considerable amoimt of clear serum in the ven- tricles, and even a moderate dilatation of these cavities, are not necessarily evidences of disease. 4

THE ORGAKS OF GENERATIOK THE VULVA. MALFOKMATIONS. The external genitals may be entirely absent, or imperfectly developed. The clitoris and nymplise may be abnormally large, or tlie nymphse may be increased in number. The clitoris may be abnormally long, resembling a penis, at the same time the vagina is narrow, the uterus small and un- developed, the ovaries small, sometimes situated in the labia, the mammae small, and the body of a masculine character. The clitoris may be perforated by the urethra, or may be cleft and apparently double. The large or small labia may grow together, with or without obstruction of the urethra. There may be a fleshy septum above the lower commissure of the vulva. HiEMOEKUAGE. Haemorrhage may take place from wounds or ulcers of the vulva. The most important form of haemorrhage is that which occurs in the connective tissue of the labia majora. This is produced during labor. One of the labia may be swollen and distended by the extravasated blood, until it is as large as a child's head. The blood may be gradually absorbed, or it may become gan- grenous with suppuration of the surrounding tissue. The puru- lent matter may escape through the skin, and the patient re- cover ; or the suppuration may extend into the pelvis, and cause death.

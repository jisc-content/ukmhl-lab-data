329 GOUT. LEUKEMIA.—PSEUDO-LEUKiEMIA. Under these two names, we understand two diseases, in whicli are found tlie same lesions of the viscera, but in which the condition of the blood is different. The lesions consist in the new growth of lymphatic glandu- lar tissue in different parts of the body. This new growth takes place as an hyperplasia of the spleen alone, or of the lymphatic glands alone, or of both together; or there may be also small growths of the same nature in the tonsils, larynx, and trachea, lungs and pleura, stomach and intestines, pericardium, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The lymphatic glands in every part of the body may be enormously enlarged, but do not become inflamed, softened, or cheesy. The growths in the different viscera will be found fully de- scribed under their respective headings. With these lesions in the viscera, there may be also a very marked increase in the number of the white blood-globules in leukaemia ; or the proportional number of white-globules may be very slightly, or not at all, increased in pseudo-leuksemia. GOUT. The characteristic lesion of gout is the deposit of urate of soda in the articular cartilages, the ligaments of the joints, the ears, and the eye-lids. . The most frequent situation is the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe. The cartilage may be infiltrated or incrusted with the deposit. If the gout is of long standing, there is usually chronic diffuse nephritis. The kidneys are small, the cortical substance atro- phied, the surface irregular, the texture hard, the pyramids marked by white lines running parallel to the tubes. These white lines consist of urate of soda. GLANDERS.—FARCY. These two names are given to two varieties of the same disease. The disease originates in the horse, and occurs in

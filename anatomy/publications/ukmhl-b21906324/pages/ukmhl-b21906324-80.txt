POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 70 cous membrane appears piislied outward into numci'ous small sacs, separated by bands of muscle. Stenosis of the trachea may be produced by thickening from chronic inflammation, by ulceration and cicatrization, and by the pressure of tumors from without. INFLAMMATION. Inflammation of the trachea has the same characteristics as, and almost always accompanies that of the larynx and bronchi. NEW GEOWTIIS. Ossification of the tracheal cartilages is a senile change. Carcinoma is secondary, usually, to cancer of the oesophagus. A single case of primary carcinoma of the trachea and bronchi is described by Langhaus. There were small flattened nodules in the submucous tissue. Lymjyhoma in the submucous tissue at the lower end of the trachea has been seen in leucaemia. Chondroma appears usually in the form of small multiple tumors growing from the inner surface of the tracheal cartilages. A number of little tumors may grow so close together that they become joined and form a sort of network. They may be so loosely attached to the cai-tilage that they appear to be free in the submucous tissue. They may become ossified. THE BRONCHI. INFLAMMATION, Acute Catarrlial Bronchitis occurs at all ages; in childhood and old age, it is apt to attack the smaller bronchi ; in adult life, usually the larger. The mucous membrane appears swollen, soft, red, and covered with mucus or muco-pus, the pulmonary tissue is at the same time usually congested and somewhat fcdematous. In children, capillary bronchitis is very frequent- ly accompanied by peri-bronchitis, lobular pneumonia, and ata- lectasis. The lobules of pneumonia are of very variable size, and the lung tissue between them may be anamiic. The atalectasis

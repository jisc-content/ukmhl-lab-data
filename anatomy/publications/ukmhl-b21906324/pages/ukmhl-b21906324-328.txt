POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 318 The entire process is diifereiitly interpreted by different observers. Some hold that it is a degeneration followed by atrophy and a new growth. Others, that the new growth pre- cedes and causes the degeneration. Others, that, instead of a degeneration, the waxy appearance is produced by a coagulation analogous to that which produces the rigor mortis, and that the entire appearance is a post-mortem one. (3.) Kupture of the muscles is apparently produced by their waxy degeneration. It is accompanied by haemorrhage, some- times to a large amount. It may cicatrize, or become the seat of a purulent, gangrenous inflammation. (4.) Suppuration of the muscles or of their fasciae is occa- sionally seen ; it may produce large abscesses. The Skin.—Gangrenous inflammation of the skin frequently occurs in the form of bed-sores, aflr'ecting the skin over the sacrum and trochanters, where it is subjected to the constant pressure of the bed. Gangrene of other portions of the integu- ment, especially of the toes, is produced by thrombosis or em- bolism. There may be suppurative inflammation of the connective tissue in various parts of the body. Perhaps the most impor- tant is that producing retro-pharyngeal abscesses. BILIOUS TYPHOID. Under this name Griesinger describes a form of fever resem- bling in its symptoms both relapsing and typhoid fever, and attended by very grave symptoms. The Skin is jaundiced ; sometimes ecchymotic. The Brain is usually anaemic. The pia mater may contain haemoi'rhages. The Pharynx and Larynx may be the seat of catarrhal, croupous, and idcerative inflammation. The Lungs.—Catarrhal bronchitis, lobar, and lobular hepati- zation, and infarctions are not infrequent. The Heart is usually flabby and pale. The Liver is enlarged and congested, or anaemic, flabby, yellow, and fatty. Its surface is often coated Avith fibrinous exudation.

THE TJEINAEY APPAEATUS. THE KIDNEYS. MALFORMATIONS. Entire absence of both kidneys is seen witli higli degrees of malformation of the entire body. Such foetuses are not viable. Absence of one kidney is found occasionally in adults, and seems to have no effect on their general health. The left kid- ney is inore frequently absent than the right. The ureter be- longing to the absent kidney is usually entirely wanting ; biit a small portion of it may be found attached to the bladder. The single kidney which is present is hypertrophied. Its ureter usually opens into the bladder in its proper situation, although Forster describes a case in which the kidney was on the right side, while its ureter entered the bladder on the left side. I have seen a case in which the single kidney was situated over the promontory of the sacrum. Its artery was given off from the aorta at the bifurcation of the iliac arteries, and its vein from the vena cava, near the bifurcation. Its ureter was large and short; it entered the bladder midway between the usual po- sition of the two ureters. It is not uncommon to find one kidney so much atrophied that hardly any remains of kidney tissue are to be found ; noth- ing but fibrous tissue and fat. In these cases, however, some traces of a ureter will be found. The fuetal lobulated condition of the kidney often persists in adult life. Sometimes one or more of these lobules become ex- cessively developed, and somewhat separated from the rest of the kidney, so that the organ may appear double. A single

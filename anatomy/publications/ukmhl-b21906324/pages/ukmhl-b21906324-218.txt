POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 208 H^MORKHAGE. Haemorrliages are produced in the kidney by wounds, and by severe contusions and falls, causing rupture of the kidney tissue. The blood collects in the kidney, beneath its capsule, or in the surrounding connective tissue. Rokitansky describes a form of luemorrliage produced by ex- cessive congestion. The kidney tissue is torn by the diffused blood. Smaller hsemorrhages are found with infarctions, purpura, and nephritis. CHRONIC CONGESTION OF THE KIDNEY. Any disease of the heart or lungs, or any mechanical cause in the thorax or abdomen, which obstructs the passage of venous blood into the right auricle, and of the arterial blood from the left ventricle, is liable to produce a condition of chronic conges- tion of the kidneys. "Valvular diseases of the heart are the most common of these causes. The pregnant uterus, by its mechani- cal pressure on the veins, produces the same effect. The clinical symptoms are a decrease in the quantity of the urine, with an increase of its specific gravity, together with a variable amount of albumen, hyaline casts, and sometimes blood in the urine. The appearance of the kidneys is very characteristic. They are of normal size, or a little larger; rarely they are atrophied. The entire organ has a stony hardness. The cortical portion is of normal size or thickened, rarely thinned. It is markedly con- gested, either in the regular red streaks which normally mark the cortex, or, in extreme congestion, the entire cortex is dark red. The pyramids are congested, and of a dark-red color. The Malpighian bodies are usually unchanged, but filled with blood. The epithelium of the convoluted tubes is unchanged, except that it has a peculiar, stiff appearance. The veins are sometimes dilated. This condition of chronic congestion may pass into chronic diffuse ne^^hritis, and the appearance of the kidney will under- go con-esponding changes.

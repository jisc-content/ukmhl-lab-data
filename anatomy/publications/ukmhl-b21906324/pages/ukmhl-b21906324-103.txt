THE MEDIASTINUM. 93 The pleural cavity remained open, and was filled witli serum containing fibrine and blood. Lexihcemic Tumors occur as soft, white, flat, or rounded masses, composed of cells like those in the lymphatic glands. PARASITES. Echinococci are found in the costal and pulmonary pleura and in the anterior mediastinum. Sometimes they perforate from tlie liver into the pleural cavity. THE MEDIASTINUM. INFLAMMATION. Abscesses are found in the anterior and posterior mediastinum. They are caused by fractures, caries, or necrosis of the sternum and vertebrae, by perforation of the oesophagus, by suppuration of the lymphatic glands, or may be idiopathic. The pus is formed slowly, and may accumulate in large quantities. The heart and lungs may be displaced and the sternum bulged out- ward. They may cause pleurisy or pericarditis, or may per- forate outward, or into the pleural cavity, the oesophagus, the trachea, or a bronchus. NEW GROWTHS. . Lympho-Sarcoma occurs in the form of large lobulated tumors, commencing in the lymphatic glands. The cervical, bronchial, and mediastinal glands are most frequently involved, and form lobulated tumors, which may occupy a large part of the cavity of the thorax. A persistent thymus gland may also be the point of origin. These tumors at first retain the charac- ter of enlarged glands inclosed in a capsule; later, the new growth invades and breaks through the capsule, and infiltrates the neighboring soft parts. Later still, metastatic tumors are formed in the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The lymphatic glands in other parts of the body may be enlarged at the same time. '-The growth of these tumors is rapid, and they soon prove fatal.

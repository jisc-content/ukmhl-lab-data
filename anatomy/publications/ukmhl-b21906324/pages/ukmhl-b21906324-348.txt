POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 338 lungs are tisually congested, if the death is from asphyxia. They do not crepitate well, but have a spongy feeling. The Heart.—In those who die from asphyxia, the right cavi- ties of the heart are filled with blood, while the left cavities are empty. The Blood remains unusually fluid throughout the body, and is of a cherry-red color. The Stomach.—The fluid in which the person is drowned, mixed with earth, weeds, etc., may be swallowed during the act of drowning, or may find its way into the oesophagus and stom- ach after death. The Abdominal Viscera may all be congested in those per- sons who die from asphyxia. In those persons who do not die from asphyxia, but from syncope or neuro-paralysis, we find no lesions. DEATH FROM BURNING. Death may be caiised by the inspiration of smoke and flame; by the immediate effect of the burning; by secondary affections of the viscera; and by the exhaustion produced by the long continued inflammation and suppuration of the skin. The entire body may be burnt to a coal, or completely roast- ed, or only a larger or smaller area of the skin be burned. We find the burned skin divested of epidennis, and present- ing a peculiar red, hard, parchment-like appearance. If the patient has lived some time, this is replaced by a suppurating siirface. Or there are small, bladder-like elevations of the epidermis. The base of these blisters is red, and they are sur- rounded by a red zone, or suppuration may have commenced. These appearances cannot be produced by heat apjjlied to the skin after death. T7ie Brain may be congested, oedematous, or softened. More frequently it is normal. The Larynx and Trachea may be the seat of croupous inflam- mation. There may be oedema of the glottis. T/ie Lungs may be congested and oedematous, or hepatized, or the seat of pysemic infarctions.

279 THE BONES. The periosteum is thickened, the surface of the bone is rough, irregular, often covered with osteophytes of various forms. The walls of the bone are increased in thickness, and often in density; the medullary remains normal, or is narrowed, or even obliterated. This change is most frequently found in the long bones and in the cranial bones. It is produced by chronic periostitis, by osteitis, rickets, and sometimes appears to be an idiopathic process. (3.) Sclerosis consists in a change in the texture of the bone tissue by which it becomes denser and heavier. The process by which this is caused is an osteo-myelitis with the production ot osteoid connective tissue, in which the salts of lime are after- ward deposited. Most frequently there is at the same time a periostitis with production of new bone on the surface. Thus in the cranium the diploe may become filled with compact bone, while there is also an increase of bone beneath the periosteum, and in this way all the cranial bones may become enormously thickened. The sclerosis may be idiopathic, or be caused by chronic in- fl.ammation of the joints or other parts near the affected bone, or be the termination of a rarefying osteitis. (4.) Osteoporosis.â€”This change consists in an increase of the size of a bone with diminution of its density. The compact tissue of the walls of the bone is converted into a spongy, can- cellous structure filled with red medulla. The bone may seem to consist of a system of concentric lamellae, the medullary canal may be filled up with cancellous bone, or remain open ; the change may affect most of a bone or only a circumscribed portion of it. This condition is produced by inflammatory changes. ATKOPHY. 1. The atrophy may be due to defective development of the bones, and, therefore, occurs in young subjects. (a.) It may be congenital, and affect all the bones, as in dwarfs, cretins, etc.

POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION'S. between tlie stricture and tlie oesophagus is dilated. The walls of the dilated portion retain their normal thickness or are thin- ned. The stenosis is usually j^rodnced by hypertrophy of the muscular coat, by new growths, or by the cicatrization of ul- cers and sloughs. Spontaneous dilatation is produced by traction of the stom- ach downward from large hernite; by habitual distension of the organ with food; by contusions causing paralysis. In les- ser degrees, dilatation is produced by chronic gastritis and peri- tonitis. In very rare cases, circumscribed, sacculated dilatations are produced by indigestible bodies, such as wood, metal, etc., in the stomach. Diminution in the size of the stomach is produced by new growths, by hypertrophy of the muscular coat, by the cicatriza-* tion of ulcers and sloughs, and by habitual emptiness of the or- gan. In this way, the capacity of the stomach may become very small. NEW GROWTHS. Carcinoma occurs in the stomach in all its different varieties : medullary, scirrhus, epithelial, melanotic, and colloid. It is a disease of advanced life, of equal frequency in men and women. It is, as a rule, primary in the stomach, excepting the second- ary nodules which may occur in the peritoneal coat, and belong rather to the peritoneum. But Cohnheim has described a case in which there were nodules in the wall of the stomach, second- ary to carcinoma of the mamma. It is usually situated at the pylorus aTul the lesser curvature; less frequently at other points. It may involve a small part, or nearly the entire wall of the stomach ; often extends to the oesophagus, rarely to the duodenum. The new growth may take an annular shape, and form a ring around the stomach; this is especially the case at the pylorus ; or it projects in the form of one or more flattened, broad tumors ; or there is a more uniform thickening of the walls of the stomach for a considera-

280 POST-MOBTEM EXAMINATIONS. (b.) It may be the result of rickets, and then takes the form of a shortening of the long bones. (c.) It is produced by an abnormally early ossification of the epiphyses and the interosseous cartilages. Thus diseases of the joints (in children) producing anchylosis and ossification of the epiphyses ; ossification of the sacro-iliac inter-articular cartilage; ossification of the cranial sutures, etc.â€”all produce an arrest of development in the bones alFected. (d.) It may be produced by any cause which diminishes the nutrition of the bone, as paralysis of the muscles, or joint dis- eases, which x'ender the limb useless. 2. The atrophy afiects bones which are already fully deve- loped, and occurs in adults. We may distinguish two forms of atrophy : an eccentric and a concentric. In the eccentric form, the bone retains its size and normal contour; but the medullary cavity is enlarged, and the walls of WB bone become thinner and thinner, until they may be not thicker than a sheet of paper. In the concentric form, the bones become smaller from the outside; but in the long bones, only the thickness and not the length is diminished. In the ec- centric form, the space which is left by the atrophying bone is usually filled up with fat. "Want of use and old age are the usual causes of atrophy of the bones. A circumscribed atrophy of the bone is produced by any con- tinuous pressure, usually by tumors. In this way, the wall of a bone may be perforated into its medullary cavity, and even thi'ough the opposite wall. The atrophy may be accompanied by sclerosis of the bone aroimd the perforation. FRACTUKES, DISLOCATIONS, AND WOUNDS. These conditions are so fully described in works on surgery and surgical pathology that it is needless to describe them here.

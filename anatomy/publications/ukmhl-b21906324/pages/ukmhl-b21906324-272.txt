POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 262 ture is the sameâ€”liypertrophied papillae covered with epithe- lium. Fibroma diffusum, or elephantiasis, occurs in the prepxice. It consists in a growth of fibrous tissue from the deep layers of the cutis, and forms tumors, which may reach an immense size. Cysts, Lipoma, Fibroma, Angioma, have all been observed in the skin of the penis. Fibrous Tissue is sometimes developed in the corpora caver- nosa, and may become calcified. Epithelioma is not infrequent in the prepuce and glans penis. It takes the form of nodules, which ulcerate, or of papillary outgrowths. The structure is that of epithelial cancer with large, flat cells. The growth may involve the entire skin of the penis, and invade the deeper tissues. The inguinal glands may be secondarily affected. Eberth reports a case in which a cylindrical-celled epithelioma of the rectum was followed by secondary nodules in the liver and in the corpus cavernosum of the penis. Carcinoma of the penis is not common. It begins in the glans penis or prepuce, in the form of nodules or of a diffuse infiltration. The growth goes on to involve the corpora caver- nosa ; the inguinal glands become affected, and metastatic tu- mors may be formed in the viscera. THE SCEOTITM. The skin of the scrotum is subject to the various forms of inflammation, which may affect any part of the integument. In very rare cases, tumors containing a considerable portion of the fffital skeleton have been found in the scrotum. Dermoid Cysts containing hair, bone, cartilage, etc., some- times occur. Lipoma and Fibroma arc sometimes found in the skin of the scrotum. Epithelioma, Chimney Sweep's Cancer, occurs in the form of small nodules in the skin, which ulcerate, and from which little fungous growths arise.

137 THE STOMACH. THE STOMACH. MALFOKMATIOXS. Malformations of the stomacli are not common. Tlie organ may be entirely wanting in aceplialons foetuses. It may be of various degrees of smaUness, sometimes no larger than the duo- denum. It may be divided into two halves by a deep constric- tion in the middle. The pyloric orifice may be stenosed or en- tirely closed. The stomach may be outside of the abdominal cavity from a hernial protrusion through the diaphragm, or at some point in the abdominal wall. It is found on the right side instead of the left, when the other viscera are transposed, and the position of the cardiac and pyloric orifices is correspond- ingly inverted. POST-MOKTEM CHANGES. In adults, the stomach after death presents a grayish or pink- ish color, mottled with red ecchymoses. The mucous mem- brane is soft, and the epithelium easily brushed off. At the fundus the food is usually found collected, and-here the mucous membrane is the softest. It is very common to find the epi- thelium removed from the entire fundus of the stomach, so that all that portion of its wall is grayer and thinner, there being a sharp dividing-line between the two portions. Sometimes this post-mortem softening process goes on to destroy all the coats of the stomach, and even the adjoining portion of the diaphragm. In this way, the contents of the stomach may be emptied into the pleural cavity by a large, ragged opening in tlie stomach and diaphragm. "When the softening affects all the coats of the stomach, the softened portion is not sliarply limited. The entire thickness of the affected portion of the wall is converted into a gray or yellow semi-transparent jelly, or into a blackish, broken-down pulp. This softening is most frequent in children, but also occurs in adults, usually in connection with severe and exhausting dis- eases. There have been and are many difierent opinions as to the nature of this softening process. Some believe it to be an

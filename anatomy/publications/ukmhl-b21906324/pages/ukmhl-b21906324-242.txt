POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 232 THE VAGINA. MALFOKJIA'nONS. The vagina may be entirely absent, and tlie internal organs of generation also absent, or imperfectly developed. Either the upper or the lower portion of the canal may he absent while the remaining portion is present. The vagina may be closed by an imperforate hymen, or by fibrous septa at any part of its canal. The canal may be ab- normally small without being occluded. The vagina may be double, in connection with a double uterus; or, while the uterus is normal, the vagina may be in- completely divided by a longitudinal septum. The hymen is seldom entirely absent, but is often either too large or too small. CHANGES IN SIZE AND POSITION. Dilatation of the vagina is produced by tumors, by the pro- lapsed uterus, and by the accumulation of blood and mucus behind constrictions or obliterations of the canal. Lengthening of the vagina is produced by any cause which draws the uterus upward. Narrowing of the vagina is found as a senile change ; is pro- duced by tumors, and by ulceration of the wall of the canal. Extensive ulcers may even cause entire obliteration of the canal. Prolapse of the vagina occurs by itself or in connection with prolapse of the uterus. As an idiopathic process, it usually takes place soon after parturition. A larger or smaller portion of the canal is inverted and projects through the vulva. The entire circumference of the canal may be inverted and pro- lapsed, or only the anterior or posterior wall. The prolapse is at first small, but afterward gradually increases in size, and may drag down the uterus with it. In other cases, prolapse of the uterus is the primary lesion, and the vagina is inverted by the descent of that organ ; or, the body of the uterus may retain its normal position, while an

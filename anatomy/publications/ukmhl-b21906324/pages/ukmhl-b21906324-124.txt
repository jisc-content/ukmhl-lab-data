114 POST-MORTEM EXAMIXATIOXS. THE ARTERIES. MALFORMATIONS. The most irajiortant anomalies of the aorta and ^-(nlnionaiy artery have already been mentioned in connection witli those of the heart. Congenital stenosis of the aorta will be spoken of xmder the head of stenosis. Anomalies in the distribution and origin of the arteries are principally of interest to anato- mists. DILATATION. ANELTIISMS. (1.) Cirsoid Aneurism consists in the dilatation and length- ening of large or small arteries. The walls of the artery are thinned, the vessel is tortuous, and in places sacculated. These changes are most frequent in small arteries, especially the tem- poral and occipital; they involve the trunk of the vessel, and its branches, or may extend to the capillaries and small veins. They form larger or smaller tumors beneath the skin. IJarely they are found in tlie larger arteries, and even in the aorta. (2.) TJie ordinary Aneurism is a dilatation of the coats of the artery over a larger or smaller part of its course. Such dilata- tions are usually due to chronic endarteriitis. According to their shape we may distinguish two varieties : the diffuse and the circumscribed. (1.) The diffuse, cylindrical, or fusiform aneurism consists in a uniform dilatation of all the coats of an artery, so that it as- sumes the shape of a fusiform or cylindrical swelling. In the walls of the dilated portion of the vessel there are often smaller circumscribed dilatations. The wall of the aneurism is athero- matous or calcified; the middle coat may be atrophied. The arch of the aorta is the most common seat of this form of an- eurism ; but the entire length of the aorta, or parts of any other arteries, may be dilated in the same way. (2.) The circumscribed or sacculated aneurism consists cither in a dilatation of the entire circumference of an artery over a short portion of its length, or in a dilatation of only a small portion of one side of the wall, so that the aneurism looks like

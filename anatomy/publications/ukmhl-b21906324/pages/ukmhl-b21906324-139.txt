129 THE MOUTH. ULCEKATION. Simple follicular ulcers of the mucous membrane of the mouth are common and trivial. Syphilitic ulcers may be merely superficial, or they may be produced by the softening of gummy tumors in the deep layers of the mucous membrane, and attain a large size. Sometimes chancres are found in this situa- tion. Scorbutic nlcers may be preceded by croupous inflammation, or by simple gangrene of small portions of the mucous mem- brane. They may be extensive and of a serious character, GANGRENE, Gangrene of the lips and cheeks, or JS'oma, is most frequent in cachectic children, and as a consequence of the abuse of mer- cury. Mucli more rarely it occurs in-' adults after typhus and other exhausting diseases. The disease begins in mu- cous membrane of the cheeks, near one of the corners of the mouth. Tlie mucous membrane becomes infiltrated with pus, discolored, black, and gangrenous. The same rapid gangrenous process extends through the entire thickness of the cheek, and produces perforation. At the same time the gangrene spreads in all directions, involves the neighboring soft parts, the bones, and even the neck. Besides this form of gangrene, other forms are produced by erysipelas, bm'ns, bites of insects, and glanders, NEW GKOWTHS. Adenoma occurs in the mucous membrane covering the' mouth, lips, and soft palate. The tumors are rounded, usually small, but sometimes as large as a hen's egg. They may be sit- uated in the deep layers of the mucous membrane, or project in a polypoid form. They are formed by an hypertrophy of the normal mucous glands. The glandular acini are increased in number and size; the epithelial cells are increased in number, and often i;ndergo colloid degeneration, so as to form cysts. Paj>illo7na occurs most frequently at the edges of the lips, 9

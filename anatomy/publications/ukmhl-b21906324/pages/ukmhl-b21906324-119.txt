THE HEART, 109 The aortic valve may be insufficient, or stenosed, or both. Insufficiency produces dihatation or liypertrophy of the left ventricle, secondarily of the left auricle, right ventricle and auricle. Stenosis, with insufficiency, produces the same lesions in a higher degree. Stenosis alone produces dilatation of the left ventricle without hypertrophy, giving the heart a globular form. The pulmonary valve is rarely insufficient or stenosed. It causes dilatation or hypertrophy of the right ventricle and auricle. The changes produced by valvular lesions in other parts of the body are due to an increase of venous, or a diminution of arterial pressure, both resulting in the same way, namely, in a constant venous congestion of the different viscera, and serous effusions into the different serous cavities. Stenosis of the mi- tral valve, or of the pulmonary artery, produces these changes in the highest degree. Pigment induration of tlie lungs, congestion and subsequent changes in the liver, catarrhal inflammation of the stomach and intestines, induration of the kidneys, and cyanosis of the skin may all be found. ANEURISM OF THE HEART. Sacs filled with blood, situated in the walls of the heart, and commimicating with its cavities, are formed in several different ways. (1.) In consequence of inflammatory processes in the endo- cardium and muscular tissue, a small or large portion of the wall is converted into fibrous tissue. The portion thus chang- ed no longer resists the pressure of the blood from within, and is driven outward. Such a pouch may be a circumscribed sac, communicating with the heart cavity by a small opening, or may look like a dilatation of part of the ventricle. The wall of such an aneurism becomes thinner as the sac increases in size. It is composed of the endocardium, new fibrous tissue, visceral pericardium, and sometimes the adherent parietal pericardium. The walls may calcify ; or rarely they become so thin as to rup-

POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIO^TS. 92 pliragmatic pleura and tlie chest-wall, and between tlie pul- monary pleura and lung. In pleurisy of long standing, the thickening and adhesions of the pleura are prominent lesions. In fibrous phthisis and in chronic catarrhal phthisis, the pulmonary pleura is often enor- mously thickened. The pulmonary and costal pleura may be- come inseparably adherent over an entire lung, or they may be united at various points by firm membranous adhesions. These adhesions and thickenings may, after a time, become calcified. HYDKOPNEUMOTHOKAX. The pleural cavity may contain air. The air enters either through a perforation of the chest-wall or of the lung. The air is usually accomjianied by a purulent exudation in the pleural cavity. In phthisis, in pysemic infarctions, gangrene, hydatid sacs, empyema, emphysema, bronchiectasia, abscesses of the adjoin- ing soft parts, perforation of the oesophagus, and in wounds of the thorax, air may enter tlie pleural cavity. NEW GROWTHS. Fibroma occurs in the form of small, white nodules; of poly- poid tumors, as large as a walnut; and of small nodules, free in the pleural cavity. Lipoma occurs in the form of large masses growing from the connective tissue beneath the costal pleura and pushing this membrane inward. Angioma has been seen in the costal pleura. Cysts^ both serous and dermoid, are sometimes found. Tubercles are found in tlie pleura as small, gray, miliary granulations. They are often found witli tubercular and ca- tarrhal phtliisis. Carcinoma is secondary to that disease in other organs, espe- cially in the mamma. It forms small, Avhitish nodules in the costal and pulmonary pleura. They are either soft or hard. With cancer of the mediastinum the pleura is often involved. I have seen a case in which there was a layer of new growtli, two inches thick, on the outer surface of the costal pleui'a.

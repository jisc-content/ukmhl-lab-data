97 THE PERICAEDIUM. "With the serum, the pus, or the fibrine, there may he an extravasation of blood, sometimes in large amount. Pericarditis may run an acute or a chronic course. It may end in death; in absorption of the serum ; in membranous thickenings of the pericardium; in adhesions between its visceral and parietal portions ; or the pu^ and fibrine together may undergo cheesy degeneration. With large, serous effusions, especially when they are chronic, the heart-wall becomes soft and flabby, and there may be con- sequent dilatation of the ventricles. There may be also granu- lar degeneration of the muscular fibres, especially of those near the pericardium. In some cases of chronic pericarditis we find irregular calcific plates. The calcification takes place in the membranous thick- enings and adhesions of the pericardium, in the parietal peri- cardium, or in the cheesy masses of thickened pus which are found with and in extensive adhesions. NEW GROWTHS. Carcinoma is found in the pericardium in the form of small nodules, metastatic tumors from cancerous or epithelial growths of other parts. In cancers of the mediastinum, the greater part of the parietal pericardium may be involved in the new growth. Sarcoma is foimd in the same way in metastatic nodules, and as a continuous infection from mediastinal sarcomata. Fibroma occurs rarely. It may have the polypoid form, and the pedicle may atrophy so as to leave free fibrous bodies in the pericardial cavity. Cysts of the visceral pericardium have been described by Rokitansky. Tiibercles in the miliary form are found in the pericardium, and in inflammatory membranes. 7

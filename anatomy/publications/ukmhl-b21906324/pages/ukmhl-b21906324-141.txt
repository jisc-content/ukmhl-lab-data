THE TONGUE. 131 Yerj rarely the tongue is separated into two lialves by a cleft, extending from the tip to the root. There may be two tongues, one situated over the otlier. HYPERTROPHY. Makroglossia, or hypertrophy of the tongue, is usually a con- genital, sometimes an acquired condition. The congenital form continues to increase after birth. The jaws, lips, and cheeks are deformed by the pressure of the enlarged tongue. The tongue may reach an enormous size. Its surface remains smooth, or is nodulated and fissured. The increase in size ap- pears to be due principally to a growth of connective tissue. The muscular fibres retain their normal development. The lymphatic vessels are often enlarged. The epithelium is hyper- trophied. The hypertrophy is not always uniform ; part of the tongue may be larger than the rest. INFLAMMATION. Inflammation may involve the mucous membrane, or the in- terstitial tissue of the tongue. Inflammation of the mucous membrane forms a part of the different forms of stomatitis. Parenchymatous Glossitis is produced by injuries of the tongue, by mercury, typhus fever, small-pox, etc. It usually runs an acute course, and involves the entire tongue. Tlie tongue is swollen, red, fissui'ed, covered with crusts or fibrinous exudation. The swelling may be so grea4.as to cause suffocation and death ; or it may go on to suppuration or to gangrene; or be- come chronic, and result in fibrous induration. NEW GROWTHS. Cysts.â€”The most common forms of cyst are the large sacs beneath, or partly in the substance of the tongue, (Eanula.) Some of these are dilatations of the ducts of the submaxillary and sublingual glands ; others are new growths in the connec- tive tissue. Rarely cysts are found entirely in tlie tongue itselt.

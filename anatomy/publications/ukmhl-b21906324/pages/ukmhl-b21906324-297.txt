287 THE BONES. teitis. The bone is destroyed both by the pressure of the gran- ulating medulla and by a molecular destruction, forming irre- gular cavities, in which a sort of chalky dust can often be found. The basement substance of the bone may become gran- ular, or separate into flakes, or give up its calcareous salts, and become fibro-cartilaginous. The bone-cells may be enlarged, fatty, or contain an increased number of nuclei. NECROSIS. By necrosis we understand the death of a larger or smaller portion of bone. This condition is induced by causes which deprive the bone of its proper vascular supply from the perios- teum and medulla. Suppurative periostitis, osteomyelitis, and osteitis, traumatic separation of the periosteum, ulcers of neigh- boring soft parts, emboli, and diseases like typhus, which di- minish the vitality, may cause necrosis. When a portion of bone has died, an inflammation is set up at the dividing line between the dead and living bone. This inflammation has the characters of a rarefying osteitis, and finally separates the dead from the living bone. The dead bone, or sequestrum, may remain smooth and unaltered, or it may be eroded by the pressure of surrounding granulations. Necrosis may involve the superficial layers, or the entire thickness of the wall of a long bone; or only the spongy tissue and inner layers of the wall; or an entire bone; or a number of diiferent portions of the same bone. The death and separation of the bone is very soon followed by the growth of new bone to repair the loss. The periosteum, the medulla, and the surrounding soft tissues may all take part in this new growth. The new bone is usually irregular, rough, perforated with openings, and incloses and takes the place of the sequestrum more or less completely, RICKETS. Rickets is a disease of the bones aifecting their growth, which prevents the proper ossification of the growing bone. The disease usually occurs during the first two years of life.

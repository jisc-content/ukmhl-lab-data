219 THE KIDNEYS. tubercles, wliieli become aggregated and form the clieesy mass. LeuJcccmic Tumors are sometimes foiuid in the kidneys in con- nection with similar growths in the other viscera. The tumors are small, whitish, composed of lymphoid cells, and situated in the intertubular tissue. SijphilitiG Gummata have been observed in a few cases. They were in the form of nodules of the usual character. Klebs describes a more diffuse growth of fusiform cells between the tubes in a case of congenital syphilis. Sarcoma occurs in the kidney in the form of metastatic nodules. Myxo-sarcomata grow from the pelvis. Adenoma.—Klebs describes under this name tumors of small size, situated in the cortex. They are white, soft, and rounded. They consist of a connective tissue stroma, supplied with ves- sels, and in which are long, tubular, anastomosing spaces filled with small, polygonal, epithelial cells. The relationship of this form of tumor to true carcinoma is not well established. Carcinoma occurs in the kidney as a primary or secondary disease. The secondary tumors are usually of moderate size, and may occur in both kidneys. Primary carcinoma usually affects one kidney—more fre- quently the right than the left. It is most frequently of a soft, medullary, hjemorrhagic character. But scirrhus, melanotic, and colloid cancer also occur. The tumors gradually replace the kidney tissue, and often reach an enormous size. The new growth may project into the ureters, into the renal vein, and through this into the vena cava. Angioma Cavernosum occurs in the form of small, encap- suled nodules, situated in the cortex. Their structure is the same as that of the angiomata of the liver. PARASITES. EchinoGOCci are of not infrequent occurrence in the kidney. Gysticercus cellulosoB and Pentastoma denticulatum have been seen in a few cases. Eustrongylus gigas is sometimes found in the pelvis of the kidney.

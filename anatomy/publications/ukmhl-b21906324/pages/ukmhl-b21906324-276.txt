POST-MORTEM EXAMINATIONS. 266 cumulates in the upper part of the vaginal process, which com- miniicates with the peritoneal cavity. (d.) The vaginal process is closed in the inguinal canal and over the testis; the serum accumulates so as to form one or more sacs between these two points. Inguinal hernia may complicate this form of hydrocele. Hydrocele of the spermatic cord consists in a general oedema of the connective tissue of the cord, or in the development of circumscribed cysts in this connective tissue. A peculiar form of hydrocele is produced by the accumula- tion of serum in the sac of an inguinal hernia, from which the intestine has become retracted. HEMATOCELE. Hrematocele of the tunica vaginalis consists in an effusion of blood into the cavity of this sac. It may be produced by an injury, or may complicate a preexisting hydrocele. The effiised blood soon degenerates, and we find the sac filled with a brown- ish tiuid, or a thick, grumous mass. The tunica vaginalis is usually thickened. The testis remains normal, or is atrophied. Hematocele of the spermatic cord occurs in rare cases as a diffused infiltration of blood in the connective tissue of the cord. Or blood may be effused into a hydrocele of the cord. NEW GROWTHS. Fihrovia occurs in the form of dendritic or polypoid growths of the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis. The tumors are of small size; their pedicles may atrophy, and the little bodies become free. They are usually found in connection with hy- drocele. Small fibrous tmnors have also been observed on the spermatic cord. Sometimes the entire testis is replaced by a mass of fibroTis tissue. Lipoma occurs as a lobulated growth arising from the con- nective tissue of the spermatic cord, fi'om the tunica albuginea of the testis, and from the tunica dartos of the scrotum. The tumors may reach a considerable size, are entirely composed of fat, or may be combined with myxoma or sarcoma.

CEREBRAL NERVES. 689 ! eius, it divides into two branches, one of which ascends to the cervical portion of that muscle, whilst the second ' descends in its dorsal division. Occasionally the nerve i passes beneath the sterno-mastoid without piercing its 1 fibres, but always sending one or two small filaments to lit. The function of this nerve was believed by Sir C 1 Bell to be respiratory, whilst BischofF regards it merely : as the anterior root of the pneumogastric, both resem- :bling a spinal nerve. Lingual, or Ninth Nerve, arises by six or eight small filaments from the groove between the pyramidal land olivary bodies, these being sometimes collected into ttwo roots, with the vertebral artery coursing upwards cbetween them, and, having united to form a single trunk which passes outwards and forwards, it escapes from the .cranium by the anterior condyloid foramen, lying in- tternal to the carotid artery and jugular vein; then run- ming outwards behind the former and in front of the h atter and pneumogastric nerve, it communicates with tthe eighth, sympathetic, and first and second cervical raerves; then, descending in front of the internal juo-ular v/em, It alters its course, hooking round the occ°pital nnd occasionally the sterno-mastoid branch ofthe ex- tuernal carotid, and, running downwards, forwards, and inwards, parallel but inferior to the posterior belly of :.iie digastric, it crosses the internal and external caro- ■ids and the facial arteries; then winds above the ten- Mon of the digastric and mylo-hyoid, and lies on the !iyo-glossus muscle, which separates it from the lingual jrrtery; and at the anterior edge of the latter muscle it mdes into long flat branches, which are distributed to hhe linguahs, genio-hyo-glossus, hyo- and stylo-glossus buscles. As It hooks round the occipital artery, the de- oendens nom arises, which lies on the external andan- •3rior part of the sheath of the carotid above, but below msses to the internal side, uniting with the communi- ains nom to form the omo-hyoid plexus; this branch I., however, occasionally in the sheath, and may even lie • ehind the carotid. As the trunk is passing above the i hyoides it gives off the thyro-hyoid branch, which nns downwards and forwards over the lingual artery the thyro-hyoid muscle, and lastly on thi hyo-glos-

POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. 503 pneumogastric nerve, crossing over the longus colli, sympathetic nerve, inferior thyroid and vertebral arte- ries, then turning inwards in front of the subclavian ar- tery, it opens into the vein of that name just where it unites with the jugular to form the vena innominata (see Lymphatic System). (Esophagus.—This musculo-membranous tube com- mences at the termination of the pharynx, opposite the body of the fifth cervical vertebra, and extends to the cardiac orifice of the stomach, or a point corresponding to the eleventh dorsal vertebra. It may be examined successively in the neck, thorax, and abdomen. At its commencement the longitudinal muscular fibres are con- nected to a vertical ridge on the back part of the cri- coid cartilage; the mucous membrane also passes from the pharynx to line its internal surface, and the inferior constrictor, which surrounds its external aspect, tends to produce a continuity between the canals. From this the oesophagus passes downwards and to the left, ap- pearing on that side of the trachea at the upper maro-in of the sternum. ^ Relations in the Neck—In front, the trachea and re- current nerves; laterally, the thyroid body, inferior ar- teries of that name, the carotids, particularly that of the left side, and the thoracic duct; Avhile posteriorly it lies on the preevertebral fascia which separates it from the longi colli muscles. On entering the thorax the tube approaches the middle line lying behind the arch of the aorta, the trachea, however, intervening in thig position. On the left side it supports the left subcla- vian artery, and opposite the third dorsal vertebra it lies on the right side of the descending aorta, crossed in this situation by the left bronchus, left pulmonary ar- tery and veins, and is supported by the spine; it now gradually alters its position, crossing the thoracic aorta from right to left, and lying behind the pericardium; then passes through the (Esophageal opening in the dia- [phragm, anterior and to the left side of the aorta. In the posterior mediastinum the pneumogastric nerves are attached to its surface, forming the plexus gula3; the I left vagus lying anterior and to the left side, the right

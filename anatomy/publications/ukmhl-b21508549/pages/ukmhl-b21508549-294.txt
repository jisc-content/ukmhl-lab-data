284 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, fact, that when the palate is swollen to such an extent as to lie in contact with the tongue, spasmodic cough- ing rarely, if ever, occurs. The soft palate is of utility in the expression of sounds, both natural and acquired, but its integrity is of paramount importance in con- nexion with the function of deglutition. During the performance of this act, when the food is passing over the retracted and elevated root of the tongue, when at the first impression of irritation the upper part of the pharynx contracts, and the isthmus of the fauces is closed, there is a natural tendency to regurgitation through the nares. Magendie believes that it is obviated by the elevation of the soft palate, but the subsequent observations of Dzondi have proved that a more com- plex mechanism fulfils this important office. The pa- late, no doubt, suffers tension; but then the palato- pharyngei contract, forming an oblique plane directed downwards and backwards, but still there exists a fis- sure between them to which the elevated and shortened uvula is applied; thus a perfect partition is established between the nasal and buccal portions of the pharynx, and in this way regurgitation is avoided. The vascular supply is derived from the ascending and descending palatine arteries; the nerves Avhich influence it are the palatine branches of Meckel's ganglion. Isthmus Faucium is an oval opening of communica- tion between the mouth and pharynx, in shape trans- versely oval, bounded above by the velum and uvula; below by the base of the tongue, and laterally by the half-arches of the palate and the tonsil. This opening is subject to variations in figure, depending on the po- sition of the tongue, the movements of the palato-pha- ryngei and glossi, and also on the degree of development of the tonsil. Tonsils or AMYGDALiE.â€”These are oval or almond- shaped follicular glands, placed in a recess between the anterior and posterior pillars of the palate, large above, narrow and pointed below, covered by afiue mucous mem- brane prolonged into the follicles which constitute the greater portion of these bodies. Each tonsil has anteriorly the palato-glossus; posteriorly, the palato-pharyngeus; below, the base of the tongue; and externally, the supe-

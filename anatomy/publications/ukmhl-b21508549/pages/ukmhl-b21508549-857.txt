BRANCHES OF INTERNAL ILIAC. 847 vides almost immediately into its terminal 'branclies. Hence it must be divided into an intra and extrapelvic stage. Relations of Intrapelvic Stage—Anteriorljs perito- neum, internal iliac artery and vein; posteriorly, com- municating branch of lumbo-sacral nerve, which sepa- rates it from the bone, and then becomes external to it. In this stage it is ahvays surrounded by a quantity of hard condensed areolar tissue of a yellow colour. On reaching the upper margin of the great sciatic notch the gluta^al throws off a large branch for the supply of the bone, which anastomoses in its cancellous structure with the ilio-lumbar, and then emerges between the communicating branch of the lumbo-sacral and first sa- cral nerves; then between the margin of the notch, which it grooves, and the pyriformis muscle, and ulti- mately stands boldly out between the latter and the posterior margin of the gluta3us minimus; in this course it is accompanied by the superior glutteal nerve, which lies anterior and external to it, and the gluteal vein, which is posterior to it. Dividing now into two branches,—a superficial and deep, the former enters the substance of the gluteus maximus, and separates into a number of long, slender ramusculi, some of which pass upwards to the posterior part of the crest of the ilium to anastomose with the ilio-lumbar and internal circum- flex ilii; some run upwards and backwards to the pos- terior surface of the sacrum, to communicate with the perforating branches of the middle and lateral sacral; while others again pass downwards and backwards to the coccyx, perforating the sciatic ligaments to anasto- mose with the coccygeal branch of the sciatic. The latter or profunda division of the glutseal divides into three branches,—a superior, middle, and inferior: the first winds upwards and forwards between the glutseus medius and minimus, following the curved orio-in of the latter muscle, and at the anterior superior spine of the ilium anastomoses with the ilio-lumbar and the cir- cumflex of the femoral and external iliac; the second or middle runs forwards, still between the same muscle^^ but across the centre of the minimus, to the anterior inferior spine, where it communicates with the ascend-

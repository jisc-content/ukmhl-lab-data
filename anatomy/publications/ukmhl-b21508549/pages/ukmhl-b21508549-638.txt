T^NiA Semicircularis—A flattened band of me- dullary substance, lying between the corpus striatum and the optic thalamus; arises from the corpus genicu- latum externum on the posterior part of the optic tha- lamus, runs downwards, forwards, and inwards, and joins the descending pillars of the fornix in the fora- men commune anterius. It is of a yellowish white co- lour, and adheres intimately to the two bodies between which it runs, near its anterior part being much thick- ened, a condition depending on the density of the arach- noid'covering in this situation (lamina cornea); the vein of the corpus striatum lies beneath this point, which frequently gives it a bluish tint. The t^nia constitutes a part of the fibres of conjunction, unitmg parts on one side of the middle line, as the. fornix and optic thalamus. Optic Thalami are ovoid bodies placed between tJie divergent or pointed extremities of the corpora striata; they are somewhat brownish grey in colour, and each corresponds above to the body of the lateral ventricle, choroid plexus, fornix, and velum interpositum; infe- riorly, in its two posterior thirds, to the inferior cornu of the lateral ventricle, and in its anterior to the crus cerebri; externally to the corpus striatum and taenia semicircularis, and more deeply to a mass of white sub- stance (double semicircular centre), which forms a sep- tum between it and the corpus striatum; internally it corresponds from before backwards to the descending pillars of the fornix, choroid plexus, peduncles of the pineal gland, commissura mollis, third ventricle, crura cerebri, posterior commissure, and the vertical pedun- cles of the pineal gland; the posterior extremities are notched, being divided into two tubercles,—corpora ceniculata externa and interna,—the former givmg ori- gin to one root of the optic nerve, with thet^nia semi- circularis; the latter also gives origin to the second root of the nerve, and lies in contact with the nates; whilst the anterior extremities, smaller than the poste- rior, correspond to the foramen commune anterms. ihe opti^c thalami are composed of grey matter, through

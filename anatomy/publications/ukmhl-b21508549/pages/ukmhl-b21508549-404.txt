394 THK MUSCULAR SYSTEM. from the epididymis, scrape off a few of the superficial lobules, and let the further examination be pursued under water. The testicle consists of a system of tubules commencing rarely by free extremities, but more frequently by loops, or anastomosing branches; they are from to -j-'^j- of an inch in diameter, and 840 in number, two or more being enclosed in each lobule; the tubes are two feet three inches in length, and the lobules from three to four hun- dred in number. The base of each lobule is directed towards the anterior edge of the testicle, the apex ending in the tubuli recti, about twenty in number, and ^'^ of an inch in diameter; these pierce the mediastinum tes- tis, and between the layers of that process they form the rete testis, a number of wavy tubes, from seven to thirteen, frequently dividing, and anastomosing in their course to the upper part of the mediastinum, where they terminate as the vasa efferentia, or coni vasculosi; these constitute the emissory tubes, are collected into a nar- row fasciculus, consisting of about thirteen canals, some- what smaller than the tubuli recti, and join the globus major of the epididymis. Epididymis.—Hourglass in shape, placed at the su- perior and posterior part of the gland; it consists of a head or globus major, body, and tail, or globus minor, and is formed of a single tube convoluted, about twenty- one feet in length (Lauth), with the greatest intricacy, arranged in spheroids or lobules, having a free commu- nication with each other, in this respect differing from the lobules of the testicle, which do not communicate; they are united by a fibrous layer or envelope, already described, which preserves their natural relation to each other, while from the globus minor the vas deferens arises. The attachment of the epididymis to the testicle is tubular, vascular, and membranous, the globus major being attached by the vasa efferentia, the globus minor by the branches of the spermatic artery and the body, the globus major and minor by the tunica vaginalis. Vas Defeuens.—This is a continuation of the epi- didymis, from which it arises at an acute angle, being at first a little contorted; it ascends on the internal side of the epididymis, to which it is closely connected; then

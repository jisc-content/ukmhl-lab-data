181 ANKLE-JOINT. this must be done with great caution, as the ligament is very weak in its character; it arises from the whole of the convex surface of the tibia, a little above its in- ferior border, from which it descends to be inserted into the upper part of the astragalus, close to its head; it is lax and of little iise as a means of connexion, serving apparently to protect and confine the synovial membrane within the joint. Posterior Ligament.—This is brought into view by removing the flexor tendons; it is much weaker than the last, indeed its existence has been altogether denied by several anatomists; it can, however, be generally demon- strated as a thin layer of lax fibrous tissue, stretching between the inferior margin of the tibia posteriorly, and the groove behind the trochlear surface of the astragalus inferiorly; it is solely of use as a protection to the syno- vial membrane. External Lateral Ligament This consists of three distinct slips or processes,—an anterior, a posterior, and a middle; the first of these is short but broad, it arises from the anterior edge of the external malleolus, from which it stretches downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be inserted into the outer side of the neck of the astraga- lus ; it is covered by the peronajus anticus; the middle pro- cess is extremely strong and rounded,—its origin is from the inferior extremity of the malleolus, from which it de- scends, with a slight obliquity backwards, to be inserted into a tubercle on the outer side of the os calcis; it is strong, and partially covered by the sheath of the pero- nsei tendons; the posterior is long and nearly horizontal; it is attached to a depression on the inner and posterior part of the malleolus, and proceeds inwards and back- wards, to be implanted into the edge of the astragalus external to its tubercle posteriorly; from this point three processes are sent off,—one superiorly and inter- nally, to the back part of the tibia; one directly inter- nally, to bind down the flexor pollicis in its groove; and one inferiorly, to be inserted into the upper part of the os calcis: this might almost truly be calledkn interosseous ligament, being partially within the joint, and running nearly parallel to the posterior tibio-fibular ligament. Internal Lateral Ligament. — This is much

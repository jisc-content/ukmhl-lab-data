ABSORBENTS. 902 downwards and outwards, opposite the transverse pro- cess of the sixth cervical vertebra, behind the carotid, jugular vein, pneumogastric nerve, and in front of the inferior thyroid and subclavian arteries, it terminates in the left subclavian vein just at its junction with the ju- gular. The thoracic duct is about the size of a goose- quill when distended, and is often double for some dis- tance, and then again single; nor is it of a uniform size, being large in the lumbar region, small in the dorsal, and large again in the cervical, while its valves are not as numerous as in other parts of the lymphatic system. It receives all the absorbents of the body ex- cept those of the right side of the head, neck, thorax, and upper extremity which unite to form a trunk of about one inch in length, which terminates in the right sub- clavian vein at its junction with the jugular.

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 714 wliile a few twigs become cutaneous, and can be traced down to the integument on the back part of the leg, to which it is distributed; the posterior division is large, and lies at first between the adductor brevis and mag- nus, and then breaks up into a number of filaments for the supply of the latter muscle, while one longer than the others runs down between the adductor magnus and the linea aspera, and, perforating the attachment of the muscle in its lower third, enters the popliteal space, pierces theligamentum posticum of Winslow, and is distributed to the knee-joint; here it will be neces- sary to allude to a branch, not, however, invariably pre- sent; it is termed the accessory of the obturator; when it does exist, it usually arises from the obturator itself immediately after its origin, or it may spring from the third or fourth lumbar nerves as a separate branch; it passes downwards and forwards on the inner side of the psoas and beneath the fascia, crosses over the hori- zontal ramus of the pubis, dips beneath the pectmeus, to the under surface of which it gives filaments, as well as to the femoral articulation, and ultimately terminates by uniting with the anterior division of the obturator itself. The communicating branch between the last- named nerve and the internal saphenous may be almost constantly found in the angle of bifurcation between the femoral and profunda arteries, but from its very small size, and the manner in which it is involved in the loose areolar tissue so abundant m this part, it sometimes escapes observation. _ LUMBO-SACRAL.—This is the largest division ot the entire plexus, and arises from the fourth and filth branches, sometimes receiving a twig from the third; it passes downwards into the pelvis, resting on the sacro-iliac synchondrosis and covered by the internal iliac, slutfeal, and ilio-lumbar arteries, with their cor- responding veins, and a little above the upper margin of the great sciatic notch divides into two branches,—a communicating, which passes downwards and outwards to unite with the first sacral nerve; and the superior gluta^al, which emerges from the upper and anterior part of the notch, above the pyriformis; passing now forwards between the glut£BUS medius and minimus, it

ARTERIES AND VEINS. 804 it in an arterial zone; the third are very short, and arise from the muscular and supra-orbital; they pierce the sclerotic a little posterior to the cornea, and are also distributed to the iris. Muscular.—A series of twigs which supply the mus- cles in the upper part of the orbit. Supra-orbital.—A large branch, which passes for- wards and iuAvards on the levator palpebrse, and beneath the periosteum; it emerges through the supra-orbital notch, first giving twigs to the diploe and frontal sinuses, and then divides into two sets of branches,—internal and external, the former winding inwards to anastomose with its fellow above the root of the nose, and the latter running outwards to communicate with the temporal. Ethmoidal are two in number,—anterior and pos- terior, the former, usually small, accompanied the nasal twig of the ophthalmic through the anterior orbital hole, and on reaching the cavity of the cranium divides into two branches,—one for the supply of the anterior part of the falx cerebri, and the other breaking up into numerous filaments which accompany the ramuscuh of the olfactory nerve into the nose, to the mucous mem- brane of which they are distributed. The posterior ethmoidal is a much larger branch, but its destination is precisely similar to the preceding. _ Palpebral.—Two in number, a superior and inte- rior; the first emerges below the pulley of the superior oblique, and is reflected outwards between the orbicu- laris palpebrarum and the tarsal cartilage, as far as the external canthus, where it communicates with a branch from the lachrymal, forming a vascular arch irom which twigs are given ofi" to supply the upper eyelid; the in- ferior, generally larger, passes downwards at first behind the tendo oculi, then turns outwards along the lower lid, forming its arch by anastomosing with the trans- versalis fascia; its distribution is similar to the last Nasal.—Always very small; it leaves the orbit be- tween the pulley of the oblique and tendo oculi, and, having given ofi^a small twig to the lachrymal duct, di- vides Into two branches, one of ^^^ich communicates directly with the facial, while the other descends on the dorsum of the uose to anastomose with the lateralis nasi.

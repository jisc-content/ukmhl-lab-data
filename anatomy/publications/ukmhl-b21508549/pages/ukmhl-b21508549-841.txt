ULNAR ABTEET. 831 the superficial arch, sending its twig backwards to form the ungual arch. Eamus Profunda, or Communicans.—Very large; also arising in common with the two latter; it turns directly mwards across the palm of the hand, over the heads of the metacarpal bones and interossei muscles, and under the adductor pollicis, piercing its attachment to the third metacarpal bone, and terminates by anastomosing with the profunda division of the ulnar, thus constitut- ing the deep palmar arch. Anomalies—It may arise from the axillary in any part of its course, or it may spring from the brachial, m any part ot the arm, and in either of these instances It may run over the semilunar fascia of the biceps, or It may be occasionally so small as to reach only as far as the annular ligament; the ulnar in this case supply- ing by Itself the palmar region. _ Ulnar Artery.—Larger than the radial, but arisincr m common with it, first passing downwards and in- wards, and then vertically downwards, to terminate on ■ the inner side of the palm of the hand, by dividing into I two branches,—a superficial and deep. Relations—Anteriorly, pronator teres, median nerve, 1 flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum .subhmis, and, at the wrist joint, expansion from flexor carpi ulnaris; posteriorly, brachialis anticus, flexor pro- ttundus, ulnar nerve, but slightly internal to it, and an- nular ligament; internally, ulnar nerve, but at some distance from it m its upper third, and flexor carpi ul- naris; and externally, junction of flexor sublimis and rproiundus. /^mar/L-5.-This artery is very deeply situated above, ■ where it is covered by nearly all the flexors of the fore- arm but in the inferior third it is quite superficial. Anomahes.~Uke the radial, it may arise in the seve- rral positions described under the head of that vessel and nmay also descend superficial to the fascia of the biceps FPress^'''" ^^'^ ^^^blm Medical Collateral Branches.—Several muscular, while those which have received distinct names are, the ante- nor aod posterior ulnar recurrent, interosseous, median

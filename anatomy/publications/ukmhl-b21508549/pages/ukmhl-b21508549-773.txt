THE EAR. Y63 internal, to the handle of the malleus, and at its termina- tion bends almost directly inwards, forming a small cup- like cavity for articulating with the orbicular bone. Orbicular Bone—As its name implies, almost com- pletely spherical, and not larger than a small grain of shot._ It appears to be simply interposed as a connect- ing link between the incus and the following. Stapes—Stirrup-shaped, lying nearly horizontally across the tympanic cavity, and inferior to those already described; it presents for examination a head, neck, two crura, and a base. The head, which is directed outwards, IS cup-shaped to receive the orbicular bone, and is sup- ported by a contracted neck from which the crura spring; these diverge as they pass inwards, and terminate m the base or foot-piece, which is elliptical in fio-ure, and rests in the fenestra ovalis, which it accurately fills up, and against the membrane of which it presses. The anterior crus is the shorter, thicker and stronger; the posterior more slender, more curved, and longer,' the ^opposed margins of each presenting a slight groove for the reception of a thin membrane which is stretched between them. The chain of connexion thus established by the ossi- cula between the membrane of the tympanum and that which closes the fenestra ovalis is acted upon by three muscles, which are called the tensor and laxator tym- pani, and the stapedius. Tensor Ttmpani._A narrow, elongated, fasciculus of muscular fibres, attached to the walls of the osseous canal above the Eustachian tube as far back as the spine ot the sphenoid; it terminates in a small flattened ten- don, which is inflected outwards, nearly at a right anrfe and IS inserted into the upper part of the handle of the malleus below the processus gracilis. pe._To draw the handle of the malleus inwards and thus make tense the merabrana tympani Laxator TYMPANi.—Always indistinct, so much so ' that Its muscularity has been doubted; it arises from the •spinous process of the sphenoid, and winding upwards and outwards to the Glasserian fissure, is attached to the [point ot the processus gracilis.

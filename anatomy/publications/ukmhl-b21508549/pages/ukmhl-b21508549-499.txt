489 MUSCLES OF THE FOOT. passes forwards, and is inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the little toe. Relations. — Superficially with the long and short flexor tendons, external lumbricalis, abductor, and fascia, deeply with the bone and external interosseous muscle. Action—To flex the little toe. The fourth layer consists of the tendon of the pero- n£Eus longus and the interossei. The PERONiEus Longus Tendon is concealed from view by its proper sheath; this should be laid open, and the groove examined in which it lies. Interossei.—These consist of two layers, dorsal and plantar; four in the former, three in the latter. Dorsal Interossei—These arise by a double origin from the sides of the metatarsal bones, the twoheads°of the first being separated by the communicating branch of the anterior tibial artery; they pass forwards, termi- nating in tendons which are inserted into the side of the base of the first phalanx, and into the extensor ten- don, assisting to form the dorsal phalangeal aponeurosis; the first is inserted into the inner side of the second toe; the second, third, and fourth, into the outer side of their corresponding toes; the first being an abductor, the remaining three, adductors. Plantar Interossei—These are three in number, and arise from the inner or tibial side and base of the three external metatarsal bones; they pass forwards, and are inserted into the internal side of the three ex- ternal phalanges, at their bases, and into the extensor tendons—these are adductors. Relations.—Ihe dorsal interossei are covered by a strong fascia, and lie on the plantar set, at their poste- rior extremity being perforated by small communicat- ing arteries; the plantar are covered by the dorsal, and he on the long and short flexor tendons, lumbricales, and digital vessels. Their action has already been ex- plained.

In the adult it is wide, and notched at the point, in the child narrow and much compressed late- rally; it consists of fibro-cartilage, and is covered by a fine mucous membrane, the laryngeal surface being studded with numerous foramina, the openings of glands which are simple in structure, and have no communi- cation with the so-called epiglottidean gland. The epiglottis is principally for the purpose of defending the irritable surface of the glottis from contact Avith the food in its passage; in man it is a passive organ, depending for its motions on the parts to which it is attached; in deglutition, when the larynx is raised and the tongue retracted, it is forced over the glottis like a coverlid; in the quiescent state the opening is much less than the epiglottis, and the disparity much greater "when that opening is contracted, as during the passage of any matter into the pharynx; except during de- glutition, it is always vertical, leaving the glottis free; in the living subject it is with difficulty seen; but when the finger is passed over the base of the tongue and any attempt made at vomiting, it becomes per- fectly evident to the touch. In children the glottis can even be reached by the finger inti'oduced from the mouth, and if during the attempt the epiglottis be rubbed even roughly, it does not excite coughing or spasm, but the moment the margins of the glottal opening are touched, it excites the greatest suffering; but as far as we could observe in a case where we had occasion to pass the finger downwards to the glottis of a child, it did not appear to exhibit the same irritability either in intensity or continuance that manifests itself in the adult under the influence of contact of foreign matter. Whether these parts were clothed with mucus, and so shielded from the impression of irritation, we are not certain; additional observations would, therefore, seem o .3

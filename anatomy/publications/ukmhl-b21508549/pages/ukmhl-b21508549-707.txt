697 BRACHIAL PLEXUS, Anterior Thoracic, or Branch to the Great Pec- toral, comes off from the plexus as it lies beneath the clavicle; it then passes downwards beneath that bone, and, emerging between the subclavius muscle and sub- clavian vein, divides into two branches,—a communicat- ing and muscular, the former anastomosing between the axillary vessels with the middle thoracic, so as to form a nervous loop around the artery, while the latter, per- foratmg the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, and divid- ing into numerous filaments, bury themselves in the^-reat pectoral muscle, which they supply as far as its origins Middle Thoracic, or Branch to the Lesser Pecto- ral, IS smaller than the last, but arises from the same part of the plexus; it passes downwards behind the ax- illary artery, and between it and the vein forms a loop with the anterior thoracic; from this loop two sets of branches are given off, some of which are distributed to the lesser pectoral, and others to the greater. Posterior Thoracic, or Long Respiratory Nerve of Bell; Branch to the Serratus Magnus Lartrer than either of the two preceding; it arises from the b^ck part of the plexus, from the fifth and sixth nerves • it passes almost vertically downwards, resting on the pos- terior scalenus and covered by the phexus, emerc^es from beneath the clavicle and lies on the inner waif of the axilla, between the serratus magnus and subscapu- iaris; It is distributed to the former muscle, a laro-e branch perforating and supplying its upper part, whifst fane and long filaments can be traced downwards to its lowest indigitations, in which they are ultimately lost Infraclavicular DivisiON.—Before proceeding to the ■ description of the terminal branches of the plexus it wil be necessary to allude to a nerve which arises i'm- ; mediately below the clavicle, and must be designated .;as the inferior subscapular to distinguish it from that I branch to this muscle which has been already described This nerve is remarkable for its size as it springs from' ithe lower and outer part of the plexus, and, descending 1 through the loose areolar tissue of the axilla, it divides unto three branches, one being destined for the inner >surlace of the subscapularis, a second for the teres ma Jjor, and a third for the latissimus dorsi, along the an- 2 h

569 LIVER. it perforates about its centre, to open on its internal sur- face, near its lower angle. The relations of the right and left hepatic ducts, from their emergence to their point of union, present nothing remarkable; they are con- cealed by a quantity of loose areolar tissue, and the branches of the artery and vena porta, and but little diflference appearing in their size. The common hepatic duct formed by their union rests on the vena porta, and lies between the layers of the lesser omentum, having the hepatic artery above and to its left side. The duc- tus communis choledochus has the same relations above, but it soon emerges from between the layers of the gas- tro-hepatic omentum to rest upon the right crus of the diaphragm, where it is covered by the superior trans- verse portion of the duodenum; it is next found be- tween its vertical division and head of the pancreas, the latter of which it deeply grooves, and ultimately runs obliquely between the coats of the gut for about an inch before it opens on its mucous surface, immediately be- fore which it is joined by the pancreatic duct, its pa- pilla and orifice being always very perceptible Avhen examined under water. Experiment, however, will prove the impossibility of forcing fluid from the gut into the duct, but the duodenum may be very easily distended from it. Gall Bladder.â€”This can only be regarded as a di- verticulum from the hepatic duct, and is the reservoir into which the bile is poured when not required. In size it is very variable, being usually as large as a small pear, and very analogous to it in shape, its base pro- truding beyond the free margin of the liver, so as to lie in contact with the abdominal wall below the cartilage of the ninth or tenth rib, and to the right side of the rectus; superiorly it corresponds to the liver, which is grooved for its reception, while inferiorly it rests on the superior transverse portion of the duodenum and right angle of the colon, which are generally stained of a greenish hue from its exudation. It terminates, supe- riorly and posteriorly, in a constricted neck, which pre- sents a remarkable curvature similar to the letter S, the mucous membrane being thrown into a large valve at each curvature, their free margins being turned towards

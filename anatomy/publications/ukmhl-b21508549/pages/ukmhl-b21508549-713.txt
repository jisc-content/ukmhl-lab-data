BRACHIAL PLEXUS. 703 branches to the lumbricales and interossei, and ulti- mately terminates in supplying the adductor and deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis. The humeral division of this nerve gives off no branches whatever, but in the fore-arm, after sending a few filaments to the elbow-joint, it supplies freely the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor profundus; about the centre of the fore-arm a twig is likewise thrown off which perforates the fascia to anastomose with the in- ternal cutaneous, and another (dorsalis carpi ulnaris), which is very large at the upper part of its inferior third, and which winds around the ulna beneath the tendon of the flexor ulnaris, becomes cutaneous a little above the posterior annular ligament, where it communicates with the dorsalis manu of the radial, divides on the back of the hand into two branches,—an internal, which is distributed to the integument of the inner side of the little finger, and an external, which, subdividing into two, one of which proceeds to the cleft between the little and ring fingers, subdivides, and supplies the skin of their opposed surfaces; while the other, on reaching the cleft between the ring and middle, likewise bifur- cates to supply their adjacent aspects. MuscuLo-spiRAL—This is the largest branch of the entire plexus, and as such appears to receive twigs from the whole of its formative nerves; it passes at first ver- tically downwards behind the ulnar, then winds back- wards and outwards in company with the superior profunda, between the internal and long head of the triceps, and, continuing its course between that mus- ' cle and the bone, the latter of which it grooves in a ! spiral manner, and emerging now on the front and . outer part of the arm, about three inches above the ex- : ternal condyle, it lies at first between the brachialis an- • ticus and the supinator longus, and then between the : latter muscle and the extensor carpi radialis longior; it mow divides into two branches, —an anterior or radial, !and a posterior or interosseous: the former descends in ■ company with the radial artery, being at first at a : slight distance, and external to it, in the middle third quite close to it, but still to its outer side; while in uts inferior it leaves it altogether, winding backwards

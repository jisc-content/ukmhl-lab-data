126 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. on the outside by the tip of the mastoid process. Two foramina are situated anterior to the parts we have enumerated,—one internal, large and ovoid in shape, the posterior lacerated, for the transmission of the in- ternal jugular vein, and eighth pair of nerves. This hole is formed between the temporal and occipital bones, and is bounded behind by the jugular ridge, in front by the carotid foramen, internally by the anterior condy- loid, and externally by the styloid process of the tem- poral bone; the other much smaller and rounder,—the stylo-mastoid, for the exit of the facial nerve and en- trance of the artery of the same name; it lies between the styloid process in front, the mastoid behind, and pos- terior lacerated internally. Eeturning now to the mesial line, we find the cuneiform process of the occi- pital, stretching upwards and forwards to join the body of the sphenoid; it is flattened but rough, broader behind than in front, giving attachment by its posterior border to the apparatus ligamentosus colli; more an- teriorly to the two portions of the occipito-atlantoid ligament, the rectus capitis anticus minor and major, middle and superior constrictors; and ultimately it is covered by the mucous membrane of the upper part of the mouth. This process of the occipital is bounded on either side by the petrous portion of the temporal bones; these divaricate posteriorly, converge anteriorly, terminating in front in a remarkable foramen,—the anterior lacerated, formed by the union of the sphenoid, occipital, and temporal; in the natural condition of the parts it is filled up by cartilage, to which is attached in- feriorly the Eustachian tube; and superiorly the carotid artery rests on it, while it is likewise perforated by the Vidian nerve, the canal for which opens on it ante- riorly. Behind this hole the bone presents a broad, rough expansion for the origin of the levator palati and petro-pharyngeal aponeurosis, and still farther back a rounded hole,—the carotid, for the entrance of the artery of the same name, and the branches of the sym- pathetic nerve which accompany it. The carotid fora- men is bounded behind by the posterior lacerated hole; anteriorly and internally by the petro-pharyngeal apo- neurosis, externally and anteriorly by the Eustachian

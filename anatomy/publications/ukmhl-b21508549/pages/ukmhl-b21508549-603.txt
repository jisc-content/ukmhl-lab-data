FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION. 593 the uterus, the side of that organ, and superior part of the vagina on the one hand, to the side of the pelvis on the other. It resembles in some degree a bat's wing when unfolded, and it contains between its layers the round ligament most anteriorly, the Fallopian tube in the centre, with the ovary and its ligament behind. Recto-uterine Ligaments are constituted by the folds of serous membrane connecting these organs, and forming the lateral boundaries of the recto-uterine cul de sac. Vesico-uterine Ligaments possess a structure simi- lar to the last described, and form the sides of that smaller cul de sac which lies between the bladder and uterus. These serous duplicatures are extremely lax, permitting the uterus when enlarged to expand between their layers without distending the serous membrane. _ Now make a section of the uterus vertically, separa- t ting it into an anterior and posterior half, and we will 1 thus be enabled to observe the form of the cavity which It contains. Taking the body and fundus together, : they exhibit a cavity of a triangular form, the narrow ;part being inferiorly, the wide portion diverging su- iperiorly and laterally towards the openings of the Fal- ilopian tubes, a slight constriction indicated by a circular ^elevated line separating the body from the cervix; this lis named os uteri internum, the cavity of the cervix ^afterwards expanding gradually and again contracting iat the OS uteri externum. The uterus has three coats,— rfirst, mucous; second, muscular; third, serous. The nmucous lining is thin and fine on the os, but as it as- cends into the cervix, it forms a posterior and anterior :(told, and from these numerous oblique crests pass off, on which the glandular Nabothi are very copiously dis- :tributed,—this arrangement is named the arbor vitte, but when the mucous layer ascends to the fundus, it as- -sumes a very different aspect, becoming fine and pale iLike a serous structure, still, however, possessing a well- raarked system of follicles, but notwithstanding these circumstances the continuity which can be traced be- iween this membrane and the Fallopian tube, together ■with the plastic exudation from its surface which super- ivenes on conception, would seem to ally it, at least func-

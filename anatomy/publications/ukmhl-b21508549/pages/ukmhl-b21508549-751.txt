741 THE ORBIT. the second below, depressor; the third internal, adduc- tor; and the fourth external, abductor oculi. Eectus Stj-pEEioR, vel Attollens Oculi Tendinous anteriorly and posteriorly, fleshy in the centre; it arises from the upper part of the optic foramen, also from the crest separating that opening from the sphenoidal fissure, as well as from the sheath of the optic nerve, then, becoming fleshy, it passes upwards, forwards, and a little outwards, above the optic nerve and globe of the eye, and about half-an-inch behind the cornea forms a silvery tendon, three lines in width, which pierces the ocular fascia by a prolonged aperture, separated from the mar- gin of the opening by a fine membranous tissue like a bursal structure, and then is inserted into the sclerotic coat about four lines behind the cornea. Relations.—It is covered by the levator palpebrs, one branch of the superior division of the third, and at its insertion by the ocular fascia; and it lies on the optic nerve, superior division of the third and nasal, ciliary nerves, ophthalmic artery, ocular fascia, and the scle- rotic coat. Now divide the superior rectus and reflect its two portions, one backwards, and the other forwards, and act similarly with respect to the superior oblique^ when the following parts are seen as the second layer: —Internal rectus, the proper nasal, and infratrochlea- tor, lying on it; external to this a fatty interval, crossed by the nasal nerve; then the optic, crossed above by the superior division of the third and nasal; and on the outer side of the last the lenticular ganglion with its roots; and lastly, the external rectus, whilst the globe of the eye is still obscured by the ocular fascia, which structure may now be examined. Ocular Fascia, or Tunica Vaginalis Oculi, which has been successively described by Tenon, Dalrymple, Malgaigne, and O'Ferrall, is a very distinct structure' forming a sheath or capsule for the globe, posteriorly being a continuation of the dura mater surrounding the optic nerve, and passing forwards to be attached to the orbital margins of the tarsal cartilages, being con- sequently conical in shape, the base in front, the apex behind; tough, fibrous, and laminated, it presents for description an external and internal surface, the former

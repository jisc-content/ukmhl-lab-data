G80 NERVOUS SYSTEM, minates. The stylo-hyoid enters the upper border of that muscle, and the digastric twig pierces the posterior belly of that muscle, first supplying it, and then com- municating with the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. The PoRTio Dura is destined for the supply of the superficial muscles of the face presiding over expression, and we conceive that the cutaneous branches, which in some cases are numerous, exercise a special influence in producing a corresponding movement of the skin when particular muscles are in action; this of course pre- supposing the existence of motive tissue in the tegu- mentary structure. Sir Charles Bell named it the re- spiratory nerve of the face, in consequence of the pecu- liar condition of the features in lesions of the respiratory organs. The Eighth Pair of Nerves—These consist of three portions, — namely, glosso-pharyngeal, pneumogastric, and spinal accessory. The first, which is the highest, arises by several filaments, varying in number from seven to twelve, i'rom the respiratory tract of Bell, between the olivary and restiform body, or, more properly, from the latter body, below the portio dura, and above the pneu- mogastric, which arises by eight or ten filaments in the same groove with the glosso-pharyngeal, but below it, whilst the spinal accessory takes its origin from the side of the spinal cord, opposite the fourth cervical vertebra, sometimes as low as the sixth, between the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, and the ligamentum denticu- latam, being at first small, but afterwards increased in size by filaments received from the posterior roots of the cervical nerves, particularly from the suboccipital, which occasionally terminates in it altogether. The spi- nal accessory having thus arisen, ascends between the posterior roots of the cervical nerves and the ligamen- tum denticulatum, enters the cranium through the fo- ramen magnum, lying behind the first tooth of that ligament, which separates it from the vertebral artery, then runs outwards and forwards to reach the foramen lacerum posterius, the inferior cerebellar artery bendmg backwards between it and the pneumogastric. The latter, with the glosso-pharyngeal, also pass outAvards and for- wards to reach the jugular foramen, not only the trunks,

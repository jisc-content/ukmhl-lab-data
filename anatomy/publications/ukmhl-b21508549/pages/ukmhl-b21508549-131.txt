THE OS HTOIDES. 121 and their arrangement on the tongue, palate, and gills of the salmon, and the similar organization of the beak in birds. Os Hyoides.—This bone is single and situated in the anterior part of the neck, between the larynx and tongue. It is parabolic in shape, or rather, it resembles in a great measure the small Greek upsilon, and hence its name. In order to examine it we will divide it into a body, two lesser cornua or appendices, two greater cornua, and two cartila- ginous nodules at the extremities of these last. The body is quadrilateral in shape, presenting two surfaces,—an anterior and posterior; and two margins,—a superior and inferior; the anterior surface is prominent, rough, and convex, looks upwards and forwards, and affords attach- ment to three muscles,—the mylo-hyoid, genio-hyoid, and genio-hyoglossus; the posterior is concave, looks downwards and backwards, and its depression is filled with a mass of condensed cellular tissue, at one period de- scribed as a gland, the duct of which was said to have opened on the upper and posterior part of the tongue; the lower edge is more prominent than the upper; it has in- serted into it the sterno-hyoid internally, and the omo- hyoid externally; the superior margin is curved back- wards, it gives attachment to the anterior thyro-hyoid membrane, and to a strong ligamentous structureof a yel- lowish colour, which is prolonged into the centre of the tongue,—the analogue to the lingual bone in the lower class of animals; the lateral extremities of the body be- come continuous with the greater cornua at an obtuse angle, the junction between them being sometimes car- tilaginous, and sometimes osseous; at their point of union, but situated superiorly, is the appendix, or lesser cornu; it is of a conical shape, directed upwards, backwards, and outwards, of variable length, affording attachment to the stylo-hyoid muscle and ligament, and to small muscular slips of the hyoglossus and middle constrictor of the pharynx. The greater cornua stretch backwards and outwards, diverging from each other, and terminate posteriorly in a cartilaginous tubercle, which in the natural condition of the parts occupies a cleft, bounded above by the lingual artery, below by the superior thy- roid, and posteriorly by the external carotid; it gives G

866 ARTERIES AND VEINS. and under those latter circumstances it may terminate either by reinforcing the posterior tibial by a cross branch, which will run transversely inwards to join it an inch or two above the ankle-joint, its course being either superficial to, or deeper than, the tendons on the back of the leg; or it may send through the interos- seous space a very large branch, which will take the place of the anterior tibial, the latter vessel being ab- normally small, and terminating before reaching the an- terior annular ligament. Internal Plantar.—One of the terminal branches ot the posterior tibial, small as contrasted with the external; it arises between the os calcis and internal malleolus, and passes forwards and inwards between the two heads of the abductor pollicis, then between it and the exter- nal heads of the flexor pollicis brevis, and, reaching the space between the first and second metatarsal bones, di- vides into two branches,—an internal, which crosses obliquely forwards and inwards to the inner side ot the creat toe, to the integuments of which it is distributed, while the external, on arriving at the cleft between the first and second toes, subdivides, and supplies their ad- iacent surfaces. External Plantar.-Always very large arising in common with the preceding; it passes at first forwards and outwards between the musculus accessorius, flexor communis, and flexor pollicis, which are above it, and the flexor digitorum brevis, which is below it; then runs directly forwards for about an inch, between the abductor minimi digiti on the outside, and the flexor digitorum brevis on the inside, being here very super- ficial, and, arriving at the base of the metatarsal bone of the little toe, it is suddenly inflected mwards and for- wards as far as the first interosseous space, where it terminates by anastomosing with the perforating branch of the dorsalis pedis, thus forming the deep pla^tar ar^. In this latter part of its course its relations are the fol- lowing :-Below it, three layers of the plantar muscle ab^ve it, the interossei and bases of the metatarsal bones erior'to it, transversalis pedis; ^^^f.^; nal to it, the adductor polhcis; and externa to it, the Sexor brevis minimi digiti.

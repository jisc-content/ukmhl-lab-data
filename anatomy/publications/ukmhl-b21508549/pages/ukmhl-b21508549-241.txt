LACHRYMAL APPARATUS. 231 numerous and stronger than those of the lower; they are curved, so that their convexities look towards each other, and meet before the eyelids are accurately closed: they are deficient at the internal sixth of the lid, on account of the inversion which this portion undergoes during the action of the orbicularis muscle; their use is to break up the rays of light, and thus defend the eye, also to entangle, like a net, any foreign bodies that may suddenly approach the globe. Conjunctiva In order to form a correct idea of this structure, divide by a transverse incision the ex- ternal canthus, and reflect the lids. It belongs to the class of mucous membranes, and is divided into the pal- pebral and ocular portions. Eble arranges it into the dermoid, mucous, and serous portions,â€”that which lines the lids being a continuation of the dermis; that part intermediate between the lid and the globe he considers mucous, and the corneal covering serous, in structure. Commencing at the margin of the lower eyelid, where it is continuous with the skin, it passes into the Meibo- mian follicles, and also into the puncta; then lines the posterior surface of the lower lid, is reflected from it on the fibrous ocular fascia and sclerotic; then passes up- wards over the cornea, internally forming the plica semilunaris and caruncula; from the superior portion of the globe it is reflected forwards on the upper lid, forming in the angle of reflection the superior palpebral sinus, from which it is reflected into the ducts of the lachrymal gland, then descending at the margin of the lid, it again passes into the superior set of Meibomian glands and puncta, and terminates by continuity with the integument. The conjunctiva of the lids is thick, vascular, villous, covered by squamous and ciliated epithelium, and but loosely adherent to the subjacent parts; in the superior palpebral sinus it is thinner and less vascular, and exceedingly loose; at the outer side it has similar structural characters, forming in this situation a deep sinus, like the superior palpebral, for the purpose of allowing the rolling of the globe down- wards and inwards, according to the usual view, but really to permit the motion in a contrary direction, or upwards and outwards; at the inner canthus the semi-

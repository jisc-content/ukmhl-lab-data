THE EYE. 755 The Nervous Tunic consists of three strata, the most internal being a fibrous grey layer, formed by the tubu- lar fibres of the optic nerve, deprived of the white sub- stance of Schwann; it is fused into a continuous mem- brane, and passes over the entrance of the optic nerve; a point insensible to the influence of light, peculiar in being the only element of the retina prolonged over that pomt, which is situated one-eighth of an inch internal to the axis of vision; the second layer, lying external to the last, consists of ganglionic cells (tunica cellulosa of Wagner), which form a much thicker stratum behind than before; and immediately external to the last, a thin granular stratum exists in immediate contact with the membrana Jacobi. Vascular Later of the Retina is formed by the arteria centralis retinse, which, entering through the centre of the optic nerve, presenting a dark spot on the retma,—porus opticus, and then dividing into capilla- ries, forms the vascular layer. By making a transverse section of the globe, in its posterior part, exactly in the axis ol vision, the punctum aureum of Soemerring is observed. This point is about ^\th of an inch in dia- meter, and appears as a depression in the retina, sur- rounded by a yellow margin; it is the most sensitive part of the whole surface, and exhibits the most dis- tinct image, but although uniformly present in man, still Its existence in other animals is extremely limited' being confined to the quadrumana and a few reptiles as described by Dr. Knox. The retina is the seat of visual impressions, and being pale, bluish and semitranspa- rent, images painted on it can be seen when the sclerotic and choroid coats have been removed. Vitreous Body.—This semifluid mass occupies the posterior four-fifths of the globe, bounded posteriorly and laterally by the retina, and anteriorly by the ciliary processes and the lens, which latter is buried in a con- cavity on Its anterior surface. Its capsule is named the hyaloid membrane, which is a structure of extreme delicacy, surrounding the vitreous fluid at all points and likewise sending sepimenta or partitions into its cavity, dividing it into cells, believed by some to com municate, but the escape of the whole vitreous humour

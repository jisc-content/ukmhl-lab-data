THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 224 above the tragus. This band is usually about three- quarters of an inch in length. Helicis Minor.—A flat, tongue-shaped band, lying obliquely on that part of the helix within the concha. This will draw inwards the helix, and thus, by acting with the last-mentioned, deepen the concha. Tragicus A flat, diamond-shaped band, sometimes wanting; lies on the cutaneous surface of the tragus ■without any other attachment. Antitragicus.—Caudate in shape; arises from the cutaneous aspect of the antitragus, passes upwards and backwards, and is inserted tendinous into the com- mencement of the concha. Transverse Helicis.—A semicircular set of trans- verse fibres, lying on the mastoid surface of the auricle, passing from the concha to the helix. These certainly are not muscular, but are highly elastic. Before proceeding to the dissection of the face, intro- duce a piece of tow into the anterior nares, also place a portion between the cheek and teeth, so as to render the structures tense in this situation. It is preferable to dissect the eyelids without any such preparation, as their margins require at all times to be free, for the proper examination of the appendages of the organ of vision. The cranium being raised to a convenient posi- tion, make an incision from the middle line of the fron- tal bone along the dorsum of the nose, upper and lower lips, to the chin. Carry a second, at first backwards, then upwards, along the rami of the lower jaw; now reflect the integument carefully forwards until the lids are reached; then dissect from above, to expose the up- per and from without and below for the lower lid, cutting away the attachments altogether at the margins of the cliiasma oculi. It will also be easier to remove the skin from the dorsum of the nose from within out- wards. This is most difficult to accomplish on the alaj, owing to its intimate adhesion to the cartilages that bound the anterior nares. The skin is thin on the fore-,

ARTERIES AND VEINS. 822 externally by the bone; and internally by the fascia, constituting the floor of the cavity prolonged on the inner aspect of the arm; through this pass the coraco- brachialis, both tendons of the biceps and axillary ar- tery, with its vein directly in front of it, and ultimate branches of the plexus investing it on all sides. Anomalies.—The axillary may divide into radial and ulnar in this space as high up as the inferior margin of the first rib, of which we last session saw an example, or in its centre or lower part. It may also bifurcate into two one of which will throw off all the axillary, and sometimes the brachial branches. We have also seen an instance of where it divided at the upper part of the space into two branches of nearly equal size, and united again at the lower part, the median nerve passing from behind forwards between them. Collateral Branches of the Axillary.—These are seven in number, and may be divided into lour internal, viz., thoracica acromialis, thoracica suprema, thoracica alaris, and thoracica longa; and three external, viz., anterior and posterior circumflex and subscapular. Thoracica Acromialis.—A thick, short trunk, ya- rvino- from a quarter to half-an-inch in length, ansmg from the front of the axillary, opposite the acromion process, and is bounded in the following manner:—Ex- ternally and superiorly, cephalic vein, as it curves around it to join the axillary; internally by the lat er vessel and below by the lesser pectoral. Between the deltoid and greater pectoral it divides into four branches—one of which passes upwards and outwards, beneath the former muscle, and along the margin of the triangular li^rament to the acromion process, where it anastomoses with the circumflex and transversalis humeri ; a second (thoracica humeraria), winds downwards and outwards between the deltoid and great pectoral in company with, but beneath, the cephalic vein, bends into the substance of the deltoid, and communicates with the circumflex, the third runs downwards and inwards along the upper border of the lesser pectoral to the serratus magniis, which it supplies, anastomosing with the "^"^"^^^^^ intercostals while the fourth, ^l^^/^^^'-y ^"^^^ 'vf reflected upwards and inwards over the ligamentum bi

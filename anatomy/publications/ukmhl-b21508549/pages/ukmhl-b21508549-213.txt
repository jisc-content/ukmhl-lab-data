203 RADIO-DLNAR ARTICULATION. until the coronoid process strikes against the fossa for its reception on the front of the humerus, but beyond this it cannot be carried. In this condition of extreme flexion the triceps and posterior ligament are on the stretch, while the hand, from the twisting inwards of the lower extremity of the humerus and obliquity of the trochlea, is directed towards the mouth. Extension is the opposite of the preceding, but it is much more circumscribed, as it is checked, the moment the arm and fore-arm form a continued straight line, by the olecra- non process striking against its recipient cavity poste- riorly, and the ligaments and muscles on the front of the joint becoming tense. The rapidity of these mo- tions is very remarkable, and depends upon an admirable contrivance of nature, by which strength, which is here not so much required, has been sacrificed to in- sure celerity; the tendons which act upon the joint being inserted so close to the centre of motion that a length of radius is obtained, the extremity of which, the hand, moves swiftly through the arc of its circle, with a very trifling contraction of the muscles which constitute the moving power. RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION. This is a double lateral ginglymus, the two bones constituting it being in contact laterally at two dis- tinct points,—above where the radius is received into a depression in the ulna, and below where the ulna is in turn received by the radius; they are united above by the orbicular and oblique ligaments, in the middle by the interrosseous, below by an anterior and a posterior, and indirectly by the attachments of the interarticular fibro-cartilage. Orbicular Ligament,—This is a flattened band of fibres, about a quarter of an inch deep, exceedingly strong, especially posteriorly, forming about three-fourths of a circle; its two extremities attached to the anterior and posterior edges of the lesser sigmoid notch, thus com- pleting the ring for the reception of the rim which sur- rounds the head of the radius. Its inferior margin forms the segment of a circle smaller than that of the

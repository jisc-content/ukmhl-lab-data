CAVITY OF THE CHEST. 516 physiologists to favour the opinion of systolic regurgi- tation, but this dilatation serves merely as a reservoir for the venous blood during the contraction of the au- ricle. The smaller coronary veins are three or four in number, and open into the anterior and inferior part of the auricle. AuRicuLO-VENTRicuLAR OPENING.â€”This communica- tion between the auricle and ventricle is oval in figure, being one inch and a quarter in its antero-posterior measurement, and one inch in the transverse; its mar- gin, round and smooth, exhibits a dull white colour in consequence of the tendinous auricular zone being merely covered in this situation by serous membrane; and on passing up the septum we observe the vestige of a foetal opening represented by the fossa ovalis; this is most frequently seen as a depression, surrounded by an incomplete annulus, and this depression or fossa may be membranous and smooth, or covered by a stratum of muscular tissue, closing the original aperture like a plug, or the surface may be invested by reticulated muscular columns, or lastly, there may be a single fleshy column at its inferior segment, which is then like- wise attached to the Eustachian valve. The annulus ovalis consists of a fleshy lip, which surrounds three- fourths of the fossa, being deficient posteriorly and in- feriorly; of its two pillars or limbi one is placed anterior and to the left side, the other posterior and to the right, and if a probe is passed beneath the upper edge, a small oblique aperture will be discovered in the generality of instances, forming a communication between the auri- cles, the peculiar valvular arrangement, however, obviat- ino-'any attempt at admixture of the blood of the right and left cavities. In foetal life the blood passed directly through this space, which was then patent, into the left auricle, the Eustachian valve prolonging the cylinder of the cava towards that point. It is incorrect to say, that the Eustachian valve diminishes during any period of foetal life, its growth being continuous up to the ninth month, a condition perfectly consistent with and requisite to the function of this structure. The me- chanism by which the closure of the foramen of Bqtal is accomplished may be thus explained :_from the poste-

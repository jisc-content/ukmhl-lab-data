445 EXTERNAL ROTATORS. Relations.—li lies on the bone, external tendon of the rectus femoris, and capsular ligament of the joint, some adipose areolar tissue intervening, and it is co- vered by the gluteeus medius, with which it is united anteriorly; also by the deep branch of the glutgeal artery and superior glutaeal nerve; the tendon is united with that of the pyriformis. J.rttbra.—Similar to the last, but that it abducts more forcibly, and draws the synovial membrane out of the angle in this motion (see Glutjeal Artery, in the Ana- tomy of the Vessels, also the Glutgeal Nerve, a branch derived from the lumbar plexus). Pyriformis.—Triangular or conoid, partly within and without the pelvis, wide and fleshy at its origin, nar- row and tendinous at its insertion; it arises by fleshy slips from the second, third, and fourth bones of the sacrum, between the gutters of the anterior sacral fora- mina; at first flat and fleshy, it passes outwards, and during its passage through the sciatic notch, arises from Its upper margin, and also from the sciatic liga- ment; the fibres external to the pelvis converge and terminate in a tendon, which passes downwards, out- wards, and forwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the great trochanter, above the digital fossa, and below the gluteus minimus, blended with the tendon of the last muscle. i^etoorw. —Anteriorly it is covered by the sacral plexus, hypogastric vessels, pudic and sciatic arteries and the rectum on the left side; outside the pelvis the anterior surface corresponds to the bone and a part of the capsular ligament; the posterior surface within the pelvis lies on the bone, and, external to that cavity is covered by the gluteus maximus and descending branches of the glut£eal artery; above, it corresponds to the glutseus minimus and glutseal nerves and vessels and below with the superior gemellus, from which it IS separated by the great and lesser sciatic and pudic nerves, also the pudic and sciatic arteries. It is occa- sionally split by the sciatic nerve, which emerges be- tween its fibres; sometimes also there is a mutual in- terweaving of their structures.

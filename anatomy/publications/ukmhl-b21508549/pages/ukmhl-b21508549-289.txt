EUSTACHIAN TUBE. 279- I the cornua of the os hyoides preserve its width, dividing 1 it anatomically into nasal, buccal,and laryngeal portions; ithe first can suffer but slight alteration either as to i length or width; on the contrary, the buccal, in conse- I quence of the mobility of the points to which it is at- • tached, undergoes extensive changes as to length and width during the performance of the act of deglutition ; the laryngeal is but slightly moveable during that func- tion. From the independence of each constrictor, the gradual contraction of the canal from above is provided, for as the function of deglutition is purely reflex, that portion contracts to which the stimulus is first applied,of course indirectly, as it is on the mucous surface the excito-motive impression occurs. Lay open the pharynx by a vertical incision on the back part; wash it out; the canal is similar in figure internally to the external out- line, and is lined by mucous membrane, presenting seven openings, all situated at the anterior wall; four of these are placed above the velum, namely, the Eustachian tubes and posterior nares; three below that fold,—the isthmus faucium, glottis, and oesophagus. Posterior Nares Two oval openings, one inch from above downwards, and from half to tliree-quarters of an inch transversely, form the only communication of the nose with the pharynx; they are bounded above by the body of the sphenoid bone, below by the palate plates of the palate bone; internally by the vomer, crest of palate, and rostrum of the sphenoid; externally by the internal pterygoid plate and nasal process of the palate bone. In the recent state the openings are somewhat diminished by the mucous lining. Eustachian Tube—In order to dissect this canal, let the levator and tensor muscles of the palate be ex- posed behind the internal pterygoid process. It is one inch and three-quarters in length, extending from the anterior wall of the tympanum to the posterior nares. In consequence of its tympanic dilatation, and a similar enlargement at the nasal extremity, but of greater size in the latter situation, the tube taken in its whole length is trumpet-shaped; the osseous portion is continued in the temporal bone between the outer side of the petrous and squamous portion, the termination appearing in the

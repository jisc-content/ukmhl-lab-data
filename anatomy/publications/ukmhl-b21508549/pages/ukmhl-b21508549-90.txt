80 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. lates with the parietal to the supra-orbital ridges; it is convex and very smooth, and is covered by the occipito- frontalis muscle; in its mesial line it usually presents an irregular ridge, indicating the junction of the two parts of which it was composed in foetal life; and on each side of this, anteriorly, an elevation which corre- sponds to the points of ossification; these are called the frontal eminences. Below this the bone is smooth, where it is covered by the eyebrow; and still lower are the supraciliary arches, prominent but rounded, forming about one-third of a circle, presenting a notch, sometimes a complete foramen, at the junction of their middle with the internal third, for the passage of the supra-orbital artery, a branch of the ophthalmic and supra-orbital nerve, a division of the frontal; a small hole leads from this notch into the diploe of the bone, conveying a minute nerve and vessel for the supply of the sinuses. The supraciliary arches are bounded exter- nally and internally by the angular processes; the external, deeply serrated, articulates with the superior orbital process of the malar bone, and from it a curved ridge is continued backwards and outwards, circum- scribing that small portion of the bone, semilunar in shape, which enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, and gives origin to the muscle and fascia of the same name; the internal angular process is situated on a plane anterior to the preceding; it is also very rough, and articulates above with the nasal bones, and a little lower with the nasal process of the superior maxillary; to these are attached the orbicularis palpe- brarum and corrigator supercilii. A prominence ap- pears in the mesial lineâ€”the spine; it is of variable lengths, curved downwards and forwards, giving sup- port to the small nasal bones already alluded to. On either side of the spine are the frontal sinuses, lying between the internal and external plates of which the bone is composed, well marked in the adult and aged, but not visible in festal life. If we noAV turn to the orbital portion of the bone, we wall find that it curves backwards and downwards, forming nearly a right angle with the cranial. It consists of two distinct plates, tri- angular in shape; the base anteriorly formed by the

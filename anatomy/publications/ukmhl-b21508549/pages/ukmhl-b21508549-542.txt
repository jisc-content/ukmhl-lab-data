532 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. their orifices being strewed over the internal sur- face, where a layer of ligamentous bands surrounds them, throwing the lining membrane into ridges or folds When the gland is unravelled by dissection, after being macerated for a short time, each lobe can be drawn out into a straight tube, with the follicles attached to it in a spiral manner. This gland is with- out any special duct, and may therefore be classed with vascular glands connected with the lymphatic system The arteries which supply its structure are derived from the internal mammary and thyroid, while the ef- ferent veins open into the left vena innommata and tny- roid veins. The lymphatics communicate with the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins; and Sir A. Cooper believes them to be the ducts of the gland. The nervous supply is principally derived from the sympathetic system, but we have observed a branch f^om the left phrenic entering its structure. The uses of this organ are involved in some degree of obscurity. Sir A. Cooper thinks that it is connected with the ela- boration of a fcBtal blood from the more vitalized fluid of the mother, while Hewson believed it was the organ flora which the nuclei of the blood corpuscles were eliminated.

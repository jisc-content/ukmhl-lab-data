40 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. the last, hut stretches from the olecranon process above to the styloid below. Of the three surfaces, the anterior is concave from above downwards, and slightly concave from side to side; its three superior fourths give at- tachment to the flexor digitorum profundus, and its inferior to the pronator quadratus. Near its upper nart is the foramen for the nutritious artery, leading upwards to the coronoid process. The internal surface is convex from above downwards, flat above, and rounded below the flexor carpi ulnaris is connected to this by a strong aponeurosis for its whole extent The posterior surface is convex in its long axis, and is divided by a vertical line, leaving a broad portion internally, a narrower externally; to the former is attached the ex- tensor carpi ulnaris; to the latter, if divided mto five parts to the superior the anconeus; to the second ?he extensor ossis metacarpi; to the third the exten- sor primi internodii; to the fourth the secundi mter- nodii pollicis; and to the fifth the indicator The ulna, as already remarked, is much constricted below and terminates in two processes : one external, the head; the other internal, the styloid The first of these is rounded and slightly expanded, covered with cartilage externally, to articulate ^^^^^-/^^^ vex inferiorly, where it corresponds to the articular fibro cartilage which separates it from the cuneiform W, th apl; of this cartilage being attached to a pit or d;pres3iin at the root of the styloid process. This last-named portion of the bone, about the size of a goose- q^ ll and about half-an-inch inlength,is f-nd on the ?nte;nal side; a well-marked groove, tl-o-gk wh c^^^^^ tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris glides, separates it from the head; it is on the same line as the posteriQr lurfece of the bone; it gives attachment- extremity to the internal lateral, and by its posterior surface to the posterior annular l^f ^^nt; ^ The ulna articulates with two bones f ""'^ rus and radius, but at two distinct PO-^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ latter. It is developed from three points Â«f one for the shaft, and one o^-^f ^ the shaft is visible about the fortieth day, but those

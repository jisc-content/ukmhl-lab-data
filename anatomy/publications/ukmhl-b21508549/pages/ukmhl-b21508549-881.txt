VENOUS SYSTEM. 871 mary, mediastinal, thymic, and occasionally the right inferior thyroid and vertebral veins. Relations.—Extra-pericardial:—Behind, the trachea and the pneumogastric nerve of the right side; in front, thymus gland, and, in its lower part, phrenic nerve; ex- ternally, phrenic nerve, pleura, and right lung; inter- nally, aorta, on which it is moulded. Intra-pericardial: —Behind, right bronchus, pulmonary artery and vein; in front, the pericardium and right auricle with its ap- pendix; and internally, aorta. In this latter stage it does not receive any branches. Brachio-cephalic, or Innominate Veins, are two, right and left, being formed by the confluence of the in- ternal jugular and subclavian veins, opposite to the sterno-clavicular articulations of their respective sides, and, uniting opposite the upper margin of the second rib, they form the superior cava. Eight vena innominata, about one inch and a half in length, passes from the ster- no-clavicular articulation downwards and towards the mesian line, lying on the right wall of the anterior medi- astinum, pneumogastric nerve, and internal mammary artery; whilst externally it corresponds to the lung and pleura; and internally to the arteria innominata and commencement of the right subclavian, with the pneu- mogastric nerve, being covered by the clavicle, first rib, and right margin of the sternum. Left vena innominata passes obliquely from left to right, being curved, the concavity directed upwards and backwards; it crosses the left pneumogastric nerve, internal mammary artery, left subclavian, thoracic duct, carotid, trachea, arch of the aorta, arteria innominata, and occasionally the right pneumogastric, being covered by the sternum, thymus gland, and deep cervical fascia, which binds it to the anterior and superior part of the aorta. The following collateral branches open into these veins:—Inferior thy- roid, which, commencing as two trunks, descend from the thyroid body in front of the trachea, both usually opening into the vein of the left side; these branches may be united in front of the trachea by a cross vessel, or they may form an intricate network on its anterior part, calculated to impede greatly the operation of tra- cheotomy ; the left internal mammary also opens into the

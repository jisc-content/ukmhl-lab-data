397 PERINEUM. PERINEUM. The Student should now prepare the subject for the purpose of examining the perineal region. Let the nates rest on the edge of the table, or be supported on a block m that position if the table is low; flex the thighs on the pelvis, and the legs on the thighs; place the wrists in opposition with the external malleoli, and secure the body m this position; introduce hair or tow into the rectum, and pass a staff into the bladder, which may now be secured by a ligature placed round the corona glandis. The Ano-perineal Eegion is oval or diamond-shaped, bounded anteriorly by the pubis and subpubic liga- ment; laterally by descending ramus of the pubis, and ascendmg ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and great sacro-sciatic ligament; and posteriorly by the coccyx; it therefore corresponds to the outlet of the pelvis. The skin is fine anteriorly, but posteriorly where It merges with the integument of the buttocks and thighs, It becomes much stronger; at the ver^e of the anus it is thin and rugated; the folds converging towards the orifice ; in these intervals excoriations fre- quently occur, attended with most distressing symptoms consequent on the action of the sphincter; the surface markings in this region are few, but important,_in the centre extending from the anus to the scrotum; a conical elevation corresponds to the subjacent urethra, the base being at the anus, the truncated apex disappearing in the root of the scrotum, a raphe runs on its centre, and on either side of the latter a concavity occurs, deeper in fat subjects corresponding to the rami of the ischium and pubis. If a line be drawn between the prominent points of the tuberosities of the ischia, it will divide this space into an anterior true, or urethral perineum and a posterior or false, these representing two trian<^les united at their bases; the anterior containing the ure- thra and the crura penis, with their subsidiary muscles â€” the posterior, the anus, and sphincters. The anterior region measures from base to apex in the raphe three inches; at the sides three and a half; and across the base three. Now make a cautious incision from the scrotum'

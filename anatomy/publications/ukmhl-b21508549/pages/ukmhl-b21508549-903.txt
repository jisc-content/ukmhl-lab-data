VENOUS SYSTEM. 893 nally they are united by a transverse branch, which, passing between the posterior vaginal ligament and the body of the bone, receives one large osseal and several smaller veins, having their origin in the cancellous tis- sue of the body, while from the external side of each longitudinal trunk an efferent venous branch corre- sponding to each vertebra passes outwards and back- wards to communicate with a similar one from the pos- terior trunks, which we will now describe. Posterior Intraspino-Eachidian Veins.â€”These also consist of two lateral posterior longitudinal trunks, similar in length to the anterior, and lying between the dura mater and the laminas of the spines, imbedded in a yellowish, soft, fatty tissue; they communicate with each other by transverse plexuses muchmore irregularly than the anterior; these plexuses receive branches from the posterior external Eachidian veins, and where they communicate with the longitudinal trunks producing vi- sible dilatations; externally, efferent branches come off, which, uniting with similar from the anterior, consti- tute single trunks opening in the cervical region into the vertebral, in the dorsal into the intercostal, in the lumbar into the lumbar, and in the sacral into the lateral sacral veins. Proper Veins of the Cord form a plexus on the pia mater, Avhich, opposite each nervous root, sends off an efferent branch, that runs outwards between the ante- rior and posterior roots, inclosed in the same sheath of dura mater, and opens into the common efferent vein in the intervertebral foramen. In addition to these, we have often seen on either side of the cord a large venous branch pursuing a spiral course, and opening opposite the tenth or eleventh dorsal vertebra into the efferent vein of the right side. The Spino-Eachidian Venous System presents many peculiarities which exercise a considerable influence on the general venous circulation by their frequent inoscu- lations, by the absence of valves, and the tenuity of their coats, being admirably adapted to fulfil the objects of compensating channels where vessels are obstructed. It communicates with the portal system through the me- dium of the middle sacral vein and the hemorrhoidal

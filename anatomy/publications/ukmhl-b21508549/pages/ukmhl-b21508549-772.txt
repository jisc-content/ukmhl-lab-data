These ossi- cula, consisting of the malleus, incus, os orbiculare, and stapedius, we will now proceed to describe m succession. Malleus is the most anterior and external of the ossicula, and, as its name implies, is mallet-shaped. For description it may be divided into ahead, neck, handle, short and long process. The head is of an ovoid shape, lyintr on a plane above the membrana tympani, and is almost completely buried in the sulcus or recess de- scribed as existing in the upper part of the circumte- rence of the tympanic cavity, but below and behind it is slightly concave to articulate with the body of the in- cus; below the head is the neck, which is constricted and slightly flattened; the handle, which passes from this at an obtuse angle, nearly vertically downwards at first, but afterwards curves slightly outwards termi- nates in a rounded point, which is firmly attached to the centre of the fibrous layer of the membrana tympam; its short process springs from the neck,_ and bending outwards, rests against the upper margin ot the tym- panic membrane, causing it to project slightly exter- nally; the long process (processus gracilis of liaw) arises from the same part as the last, and, proceedmg downwards, terminates in a sharp point in the Glasserian fissure, where it afi-ords attachment to the laxator tym- pani, the muscular structure of which has been latterly, and perhaps with much justice, disputed._ Incus â€”This bone has been compared m shape to an anvil or bicuspid tooth, and presents for examination a body and two processes,_a short and a long. iHe body is irregularly quadrilateral, ^^^.F^ff^^^^^.^^^.^f, behind a facette for articulating with the head of the malleus, and like it is situated above "\tl- -^-^^ the tympanum ; its short process occupies the same situation! and stretches horizontally backwards as lar as the m;stoid cells; it is thick, strong -d -mf ficrure- its long process is much more slender than t e kst i^ dTps nfaSy vertically downwards, parallel, but

624 NERVOUS SYSTEM. ing also downwards, backwards, and outwards on the external side of the tractus opticus, terminating where the transverse and Sylvian fissures unite. These are named callosal pedicles, and they form the lateral boun- daries of the lamina cinerea. The posterior extremity (splenium) of the corpus callosum is thick, round, and cushion-like (Bourelet), corresponding to the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, from which it is separated by the transverse fissure, containing t^eyelum interpositum and the venas Galeni. In the middle line of the posterior edge, the raphe appears exceedmgly deep and this has been erroneously attributed to the pulsations of the brain tilting it against the falx cere- bri On each side its fibres can be traced into the pos- terior and inferior cornua of the lateral ventricles, ex- panding in that situation to give a white investment to the hippocampus major and minor. â–  ^- e Let the student now proceed to the examination ot the cerebral ventricles, which are five m ^^J^b^^;- namely, two lateral, the third, fourth, and fifth; the first being symmetrical, the three latter asymmetrical, and situated in the median line of the organ. Lateral VENTRiCLES.-These may be opened by making a superficial incision through the corpus callo- Tum ol one side of the raphe, then, by turning the me- dullary structure outwards, and following the cavity m a direction outwards and forwards anteriorly, and back- wards and inwards posteriorly, while a --lar'iiss^^^^^ tion may also be made on the opposite side; lastly, pic ce the knife at the posterior extremity of the optic thala- mus and carry an incision downwards and forwards TwUs the fisLre of Sylvius. Each lateral ventr^de is curved like an Italic S, converging anteriorly, and di- ve gng posteriorly, and is divided into an anterior and posirior cornu, with an intervening body, and also an -"Z^Z^T^^:^^ is hounded superiorly, ex^

245 MUSCLES OF THE FACE. the ramus of the jaw, and with difSculty exposed in the present stage of the dissection; the masseter should :be removed, together with the parotid gland; then saw through the vertical ramus of the lower jaw, so as to remove the anterior half as far as the angle, where a transv^se section will free it below; now, as the zy- ;goma has been previously cut, the temporal muscle, with the detached portion of the bone, may be thrown idowu, commencing the dissection from above, avoiding cautiously the deeper-seated parts. We think it more advisable always to defer their examination until the ;dissection of the pharynx is about to be commenced, rwhen a more perfect view of their relations may be ob- :tained. Pterygoideus Externus Conical in shape, base :before, apex behind; lies in the zygomatic fossa, within the ramus of the jaw; it arises by short tendinous fibres from the outer surface of the external pterygoid plate, as low down as the triangular process of the pa- late bone, from a spine which is directed downwards,— the commencement of the crest on the great wing of the sphenoid, from that crest its whole length, and be- :hind it from an antejrior-prolongation of the transverse 'root of the zygoma, sometimes from the ti;ber maxil- lary ; the fibres from the pterygoid plate and crest are ^somewhat distinct at first, then forming fleshy bellies, ;that pass backwards and a little outwards, and terminate in around tendon, which is inserted into an oval depres- :sion on the anterior and inner side of the neck of the lower jaw, and by short fibres that pierce the capsular ligament, into the interarticular fibro-cartilage and the inferior synovial sac. Relations.—It corresponds above to the bone, which lis generally hollowed for its reception; sometimes its t tendon grooves the transverse root of the zygoma, near t the internal extremity. It is in contact below with the I internal maxillary artery and vein, a portion of the pa- rrotid, the dental, and gustatory nerves, and the internal lateral ligament, all of which pass through the ptery- :goid space, and consequently lie below it; externally, ■- it is covered by the ramus of the jaw, insertion of the temporal muscle, the masseter at the sigmoid notch, in-

THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 274 great vessels and nerves, and raise them carefully from the deep muscles, as high as the base of the skull. If it is desirable to preserve the skull, disarticulate the atlas from the occipital bone, but if otherwise, and this is the mode to be preferred, place the saw between the styloid and mastoid processes, and cut through the temporal and basilar process of the occipital bones; introduce tow or hair, so as to distend the bag and make tense the muscles; this object is facilitated by lirst passing the matei-ial used for distention through the cavity of the mouth, and subsequently completing the process from the oesophagus. The Pharynx is a musculo-membraneous bag, of a conical form, with its base above at the cranium, the apex at the oesophagus, and extending from the skull to a point level with the fifth cervical vertebra. The following are its general relations:â€”Behind it cor- responds to the longi colli and recti antici muscles, covered by the prasvertebral fascia; in front it cor- responds, from above downwards, to the openings of the Eustachian tubes and posterior nares, to the velum, isthmus faucium, base of the tongue, epiglottis, glottis, and posterior surface of the larynx; laterally to the great vessels and nerves of the neck; below to the oeso- phagus; above to the basilar process of the occipital bone. The structures entering into its formation are muscles, fibrous membrane, and a mucous lining, form- ing part of the gastro-pulmonary system; the muscles are divided into the intrinsic and extrinsic, the former are represented by the constrictors, the latter by the stylo-pharyngeus, palato-pharyngeus, with other super- numerary slips to be hereafter described. The CoNSTRiCTOKS, thin plates of muscular fibre, are symmetrically arranged, three on either side, inferior, middle, and superior, overlapping each other from below upwards; consequently the inferior is most super- ficial, the superior the deepest of the three. This arrangement cannot be seen when the pharynx is removed, the muscles being covered by a strong but thin fascia, which adheres more intimately to the infe- rior constrictor than to either of the others, and is very

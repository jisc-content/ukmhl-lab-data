THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 276 CO-thyroid articulation lying beneath it. These arches are not always equally well marked, but can in every case be discovered with careful dissection. Middle Constrictor Triangular; apex at the os hyoides; base at the tendinous raphe posteriorly; to see its origin, the digastric, stylo-hyoid, andniylo-hyoidmus- cles, also the hyo-glossus and the lingual artery, should be removed; it arises from the appendix of the os hy- oides, from the stylo-hyoid ligament, from the whole length of the upper edge of that bone, and from the pos- terior edge of the thyro-hyoid ligament; the fibres di- verge: the superior pass obliquely upwards and back- wards, the middle horizontally, the inferior downwards andbackwards, the fibres from the thyro-hyoid ligament being almost vertically downwards; it is inserted into the middle tendinous raphe and cuneiform process of the occipital bone; the lingual artery lies on its origin, co- vered by the hyo-glossus; it is overlapped in its course backwards by the inferior constrictor, and it again con- ceals the superior; it is separated from the latter by the stylo-pharyngeus muscle and glosso-pharyngeal nerve; its superior insertion separates the lesser sinuses of Mor- gagni, beneath the occipital bone. Superior Constrictor.—Irregular as to shape and outline; will be exposed by drawing the pharynx to one side and removing the stylo-glossus, with the parts occu- pying the interval between it and the internal pterygoid (the pterygo-pharyngeal space); it is attached to the base of the cranium by an aponeurosis, which should now be examined. Pharyngeal Aponeurosis.—This structure is di- vided into portions really continuous, but receiving dis- tinct names, derived from their attachments; these are, the occipito-pharyngeal, petro-pharyngeal, pterygo-pha- ryngeal, and bucco-pharyugeal divisions; the occipito- pharyngeal is attached above to the basilar process of the occipital bone, then passes downwards between the constrictors and mucous membrane, becoming weaker in its descent, except in the middle line, where it forms the raphe, and finally terminates by being lost on the external surface of the ossophagus; externally its margin becomes connected with the petro-pharyngeal process, their junction forming an acute angle, lying internal to

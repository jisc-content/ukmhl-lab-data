885 VENOUS SYSTEM. Hepatic Veins.—The radicles whicli form these com- mence in the centre of the lobule (intralobular vein), and this terminates in the sublobular, and by the union of the latter the hepatic veins are formed, consisting of from three to five trunks, situated at the posterior thick edge of the liver, between the layers of the coronary li- gament, and having received the obliterated ductus ve- nosus, they open separately into the cava. The Phrenic Veins do not present any peculiarity, being merely the accompanying branches of the phrenic arteries. Vena Portjs.—This large vein, although considered with propriety to represent a separate system, may still with convenience be examined in connexion with the abdominal vessels. This large trunk, about four and a half inches in length, formed on the forepart of the aorta behind the head of the pancreas, and opposite the upper margin of the second lumbar vertebra, passes upwards, forwards, and towards the right side, and reaching the liver, divides into a right and left branch, which, com- ing off at right angles with the original trunk, enters the transverse fissure, and follows the ramifications of the hepatic artery in the substance of the liver. Relations.—In front, pancreas, superior transverse por- tion of the duodenum, hepatic artery, and ductus com- munis choledochus; behind, the right crus of the dia- phragm, spine, and inferior cava, which it crosses obliquely, separated from it, however, by the foramen of Winslow. Collateral Branches.—Superior mesenteric and splenic veins, but the inferior mesenteric opens into the splenic nearly an inch to the left side of the point where the confluence of the two first form the porta. Superior Mesenteric Vein follows the course of the artery of the same name, receiving at its point of com- mencement in foetal life the omphalo-meseraic vein, which ramified on the umbilical vesicle, it receives the ileo-colic, right, and middle colic veins, and from twelve to twenty small branches arising from the small intes- tines, and which, passing between the layers of the me- sentery, open into the left side of the vein. Inferior Mesenteric Vein commences by the su-

MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. 341 fascia. We have traced a branch of the median cutaneous nerve into its structure. Palmar Fascia.â€”Triangular, apex behind, attached to the annular ligament and tendon of palmaris longus muscle; the base, broad and expanded anteriorly,divides into four slips; these at the base of the first phalanx of each finger subdivide, forming an arch over the flexor tendons, the edge being attached to the digital sheaths; each subdivision again splits, one sinking deep to be in- serted into the side of the base of the first phalanx and lateral ligaments, the other becoming continuous with a similar from the next finger, thus producing a trian- gular space between the fingers for the passage of the digital vessels and nerves, with the tendons of the lum- bricales; either margin of the fascia sinks deep, receiv- ing a fixed attachment from the metacarpal bones of the index and fifth fingers, thus separating the muscles of the thumb and little finger from those in the centre of the palmar region. This structure is principally com- posed of longitudinal fibres, except anteriorly, where they are transverse superficially to preserve the inte- grity of the subdivisions. A thin layer of fascia also covers the thenar and hypo-thenar muscles, continuous with the central portion. These fascias adhere closely to the skin which covers them, but are separated from the subjacent parts in the middle region by a variable quantity of fat; by its resis- tance it protects the subjacent nerves and vessels, parti- cularly when made tense by the palmaris longus; by its density it also prevents deep-seated matter from reaching the surface in this direction, as in paronychia palmaris. The Digital .Sheaths are dense planes of fibrous tissue extending from the base of the first phalanx to the last or ungual, attached laterally to the marguis of the bones, thus constituting a canal two-thirds fibrous, one-third osseous, formed by the anterior or concave surface of the phalanges; opposite the flexures this is weak, occasion- ally deficient, so that the synovial membrane protrudes during flexion; posteriorly it is attached to the pal- mar fascia, and anteriorly lost on the insertion of the flexor profundus; the fibres are transverse and remark- ably strong; it contains the superficial and deep flexor tendons, and is lined by a bursal membrane; subfascial

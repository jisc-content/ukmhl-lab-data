706 NERVOUS SYSTEM. pursues its course, supplying them, and is ultimately distributed to the integuments of the sternum. Second Intercostal—Much smaller than the last; takes a very peculiar course, first passing obliquely over the neck of the first rib to reach the first intercostal space, but on arriving at the centre of this space, it again recrosses the second rib to reach the second, where it divides into two branches,—a proper intercostal and perforating: the former continues its course like the others, supplying the muscles, and ultimately ramifying in the integuments over the sternum, while the latter, after perforating the second layer of intercostal muscles, passes downwards and outwards, and, anastomosing with the ulno-cutaneous divides into two branches, which are distributed to the inner and back part of the arm as far down as the olecranon process. Third Dorsal.—Smaller than the preceding; having passed into its corresponding intercostal space, and pro- ceeded a little beyond its centre, divides also into a proper intercostal and perforating; the former pursu- ing a similar course to the last described, to be lost on the skin of the sternum, while the latter, perforatmg the external intercostals between the origins of the ser- ratus magnus, first supplies the mammary gland, and then crosses the floor of the axilla to be distributed to the back part of the arm. Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Dorsal are, generally speaking, similar in their characters, running outwards and forwards over the anterior costo-trans- verse ligament to enter the intercostal spaces. A little beyond the angle of the rib, each throws off a small branch, which winds forwards on the upper margm of the rib below, but this is not always constant. Divid- ing now into two branches, the smaller or proper inter- costal continues its course to the sternum to be distri- buted to the integuments over it, supplying as it pro- ceeds numerous looped filaments to the adjacent mus- cles, whilst the larger or external perforates the outer layer of intercostals beneath the serratus magnus, which it also pierces, supplying it, the recti, triangularis sterui, and external oblique, with the integuments of

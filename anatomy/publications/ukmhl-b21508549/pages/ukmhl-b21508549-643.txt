CEREBRUM. 633 from the choroid plexus, communicating in the latter case with the third ventricle. Posterior Commissure—A thin, round, white band, smaller than the anterior, uniting the inner and pos- terior parts of the optic thalami, bounded above by the pineal peduncles; behind, by the anterior edge of the tubercula quadrigemina; before, by the foramen com- mune posterius; and below, by the aqueduct of Sylvius. Pineal Gland.—Triangular or heart-shaped, with its base before, and apex behind; the former being named acervulus, the latter, the conarium; and wh^ in situ lying between the layers of the velum interpositum, and connected to the brain by its peduncles; it is supported by the tubercula quadrigemina, whilst the vena; Galeni correspond to its upper surface. Sometimes we have seen it perfectly flat and round, at the same time vary- ing much in size and density. It is of a light grey colour, and consists of vesicular matter, the cells being granular and candate, and in the centre containing cal- careous bodies of a stony hardness and rounded form the larger being visible to the naked eye; but when viewed with a half or quarter-inch object-glass they bear much resemblance to masses of fat, each being composed of numerous, distinct, or aggregate lesser pieces or strongly; and it is in this circumstance, as well as in their large size, that the resemblance borne by these bodies to masses of fat con- sists. In the natural condition these bodies are hard and brittle, after, however, the application of dilute ni- tric acid, they become soft, the earthy matter being dis- solved away. If, however, the acid employed be some- what stronger, these bodies undergo a singular chan/re m form and appearance: the cellated spaces become almost lost to view, and then these compound struc- tures assume the characters of large spherical cells ex- hibitmg numerous concentric lamellaa. The earthy mat- ter then IS contained in these cells, or cellated spaces, the acid dissolves this away, and the entire body becomes so soft, as to admit readily of being torn to pieces with needles; m this state its structure can be easily deter- mined, and is seen to consist of membranous elastic tissue. 2e 3

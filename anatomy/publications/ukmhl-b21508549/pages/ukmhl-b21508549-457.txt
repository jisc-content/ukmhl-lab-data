447 EXTERNAL ROTATORS. serted into the digital fossa below the superior and above the inferior gemellus. Relations.—Within the pelvis it lies on the bone and obturator ligament, the obturator fascia separating its deep surface from the levator ani and bladder, and also from the obturator nerve and vessels which course along its surface; in the notch it is almost surrounded by a bursa, which is large and loose; the pudic artery nerve and vein lie above it, the nerve being nearest to the bone; the internal obturator nerve also enters at this point in its course outwards; it is almost enveloped by the gemelli, having similar relations; and it is particularly adherent to the posterior surface of the capsule. Inferior Gemellus.—Larger than the superior, some- times double, arises from a projecting rough prominence on the tuber ischii, below the lesser sciatic notch; passes horizontally outwards, and is inserted into the digital fossa below the obturator internus. Eelatiom.—By its deep surface to the bone, capsular ligament, and obturator bursa; superficially to the glutseus maximus and greater and lesser sciatic nerves; the former nerve should be drawn over the tuber ischii during the examination of these muscles; above to the obturator internus; and below at its origin to the qua- dratus femoris, and near its insertion to the obturator externus. Action—With the gemelli it strengthens the capsule posteriorly, rotates outwards, and abducts. QuADRATus Femoris—Situated below the last, and is oblong in shape; it arises from the external edge of the tuber ischii, external and anterior to the semimem- branosus ; passes horizontally outwards, and is inserted into the posterior intertrochanteric line. Relations.—Posteriorly it is covered by the glutseus maximus, great sciatic nerve, and branches of the sciatic and glutaeal arteries; anteriorly it lies on the bone, ob- turator externus, lesser trochanter, and insertion of the psoas and iliac muscles; the upper margin is parallel to the inferior gemellus, the lower to the adductor mag- nus, from which it is separated by the terminal branch

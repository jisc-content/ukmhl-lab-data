662 NERVOUS SYSTEM, passing from the pons, but beyond this point it be- comes enlarged and rounded, whilst the hard root which •was situated on its superior and posterior margin now appears on its internal aspect, where it is retained in a groove by a fold of arachnoid, which is common to both nerves. They now pass forwards and outwards beneath the tentorium, supported by a fold of arachnoid membrane, and, passing through an oval aperture above the superior angle of the petrous portion of the tempo- ral bone, are received into a depression on its superior surface, the soft portion here forming the Casserian ganglion. The oval opening, or neural aperture, is bounded above by the attached margin of the tentorium with the superior petrosal sinus, and below by the angle of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, which is a Httle excavated at this point; the margins are smooth in consequence of the arachnoid membrane which lines them, and it is further continued on the under surface of the nerve and the external two-thirds of the ganglion, but not on their upper aspects; on this account, there- fore, the dura mater adheres superiorly to the nerve and ganglion, being removed Avith difficulty, but when it has been dissected off, both the nerve and ganglion can be raised from the bone with facility. It will now be observed that the soft root expands to form the ganglion, whilst the hard lies beneath it, connected, cer- tainly, to its inferior surface by the arachnoid, but not forming any part of the structure. Casserian or Semilunar Ganglion.—Of a light grey colour, concave posteriorly and internally, and convex anteriorly and externally; receives posteriorly the soft root of the fifth, whilst from its convexity three branches emanate; namely,—ophthalmic, superior and inferior maxillary; the inferior surface, convex, corre- sponds to the depression in the bone, the following superposition of parts being situated l^eueath it :— 1 The hard root; 2. A double layer of arachnoid, that membrane consisting of a parietal and visceral portion; 3 Dura mater; 4. Vidian nerve, with the Vidian branch of the middle meningeal artery, and occasionally the small petrosal nerve; and 5. The bone, the depression in this situation being triangular. The superior sur-

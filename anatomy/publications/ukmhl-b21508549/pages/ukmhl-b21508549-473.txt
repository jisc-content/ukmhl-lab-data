463 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. right, and left, the anterior being the largest, and ex- ceedingly strong, the right somewhat smaller, but not so invariably; Avhilst the left is always the smallest and weakest of the three; the tendon presents a deep notch at its posterior edge, which receives the insertion of the crura, like the footstalk of a trefoil leaf. The tendon is narrow and thin, and the margins in the whole cir- cumference are identified with the lateral, anterior, and posterior fleshy fibres; the superior or thoracic surface is smooth, the inferior fasciculated, the principal fibres radiating from behind; and in addition to these there are other bands interwoven, crossing the former at acute angles; on the inferior surface, particularly on the right side, a number of superadded fasciculi occur, adhering but slightly to the tendon, which are raised with facility from their position by the handle of a scalpel; from this mutual interlacement it is obvious great strength must accrue; four of these bands circumscribe the caval opening. LlGAMENTUM ArCUATUM FaLSUM Vel ExTERNUJI This is merely the anterior layer of the transversalis abdominis tendon, folded on itself, being attached su- periorly to the lower edge of the last rib, and inter- nally to the transverse process of the first lumbar ver- tebra ; the concave edge looks downwards and inwards, and beneath it passes the last dorsal nerve and quadra- tus lumborum muscle, the anterior surface being covered by the kidney and fatty areolar tissue; and in order to make this fascia or ligament tense, the rib should be everted and drawn backwards. From the attachment of the last to the transverse process of the first lumbar vertebra arises the ligamentum arcuatum internum, which arches downwards, forwards, and inwards, to be inserted into the root of the pedicle of the second lum- bar, between the psoas magnus, and the posterior edge of the crus, the lower edge being prolonged for some distance on the psoas magnus, parvus, and sympathetic nerve, which emerge from beneath it. Inferior False Diaphragm.â€”This consists of two fleshy pillars or crura; each being triangular, with the base above and apex inferiorly; the right, which is most anterior, arises by a tendinous band from the fore-

MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 365 layer of this region in the male; it also gives off branches to the glands; the superficial pudic veins likewise ter- minate in the saphena. Lymphatic Glands—These are from four to seven in number, and lie parallel to Poupart's ligament, the superficial lymphatic vessels from the genitals passing through them, then coursing downwards to communicate with the deep absorbent before entering the abdomen. On raising the superficial fascia, a second layer be- comes visible, originally described by Scarpa; it is dense, semitransparent, and devoid of fat, and can be raised as a distinct layer about four inches above Pou- part's ligament. Following it downwards, in the middle line it passes over the pubis, investing the penis in a tubule; as it lies on the pubis it is beneath the false suspensory ligament, more externally it invests the cord, which conducts it into the scrotum, from which it is continued backwards to form the proper perineal fas- cia; still more externally it adheres to Poupart's liga- ment most intimately, and is finally attached in the groin to the cribriform fascia, which it separates from the sheath of the vessels ; vfhen this is removed the external oblique is visible in its entire extent. Obliquus Externus vel Descendens.—Flat and some- what quadrilateral, but broader before than behind, ten- dinous anteriorly and inferiorly, fleshy superiorly and posteriorly; it arises by triangular fleshy slips from the eight inferior ribs, external to their cartilages; the five superior indigitate with corresponding origins of the serratus magnus, and the three inferior have a similar connexion with the latissimus dorsi; sometimes they are concealed by the latter; the inferior fibres pass ver- tically downwards, and are inserted fleshy into the two anterior thirds of the crest of the ilium; the superior and middle pass obliquely downwards and inwards to be attached to the aponeurosis, by which the muscle is inserted into the ensiform cartilage, linea alba, its whole length, the anterior superior spine of the ilium, Pou- part's ligament, the crest, and symphisis pubis. The aponeurosis is somewhat triangular, the widest portion being stretched between the iliac spines; from that to the pubis it becomes gradually contracted, and above

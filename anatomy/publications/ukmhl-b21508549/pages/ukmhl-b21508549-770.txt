NERVOUS SYSTEM. 760 a good view will be obtained, both of the shape of the cavity and of the several parts contained within it. The middle ear has been compared, not inaptly, to a common drum, or perhaps more properly, to a tambo- rine, but covered in, not at one, but both extremities It presents for examination an external and internal wall, and a circumference. The external wall is consti- tuted by the membrana tympani, which separates it from the auditory canal; it is nearly circular in shape,— its external surface looking downwards, forwards, and outwards, and is firmly implanted into a fissure or groove, which marks out the position of the tympanic ring in the foetus, but is directed so very obliquely downwards and inwards, that it forms an angle of about 45° with the lower wall of the external auditory meatus. It consists of three layers,—an external or cuticular, which is extremely fine, continuous with the lining ot the tube; an internal mucous, prolonged over it from the cavity of the tympanum; and a middle fibrous, thm, but exceedingly strong; the filaments which compose it appearing to radiate from the centre to the circumte- rence, this latter constituent being described by bir Everard Home as muscular. Taken as a whole, the membrane possesses great strength and vascularity, but is more or less translucent, and is constantly retained in a state of tensity by the tensor tympani muscle, which, acting upon the malleus, the handle of which is attached to its centre, renders it convex on its inner surface, and concave on its outer. _ Internal Wall.—This must be examined by re- moving the membrana tympani, when the following parts will be brought into view :_Most superiorly the le- !iestraovalis;inthe middle, the promontory,with the pro- cess of bone stretching backwards from it to the pyra- inid,-thelingua, or tongue; and still lower and slightly posterior, the fenestra rotunda. The fenestra ovahs is semi-elliptical in shape, concave above, nearly straight bebw, directed forwards and slightly downward situ- ated in a recess of variable depth,-the fossette; it would form a direct communication between the tym- panum and vestibule but for a membrane which is stretched across it in its natural condition, against which

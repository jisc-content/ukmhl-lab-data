344 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Relations—It is covered by the skin, fascia, and an- nular ligament of the carpus; it lies on the flexor sub- limis, the flexor pollicis tendon and carpus; above, it rests between the pronator radii teres and the palma- ris longus; below, between the radial artery and pal- maris. Action—To flex the carpus and the fore-arm; also, probably, to pronate the hand, Palmaris Longus.—A long, slender muscle; arises tendinous from the inner condyle and intermuscular septa; it forms a round, fleshy belly, becoming tendi- nous at the middle of the fore-arm, at first round, but afterwards flat; it passes downwards and outwards over the annular ligament, into which and the middle divi- sion of the palmar fascia it is inserted. Relations.—It is covered by integuments and fascia; it lies on the flexor sublimis and annular ligament; it is on the ulnar side of the radial flexor in its whole course; it is sometimes wanting. Actions.—To make tense the palmar fascia, flex the fore-arm, and assist in pronation. It is large, strong, and powerful in the monkey tribe for obvious reasons. •Flexor Carpi Ulnaris The most internal of the superficial layer of muscles; arises from the posterior part of the internal condyle, from the inner side of the olecranon; a fascia with transverse fibres unites the two origins, and conceals the ulnar nerve and posterior ulnar recurrent artery, passing between them; it also arises through the intervention of the fascia of the fore-arm, from the superior two-thirds of the posterior edge of the ulna; the fibres pass downwards and forwards, form a tendon on their anterior surface that only ceases to re- ceive fleshy fibres at the annular ligament; it crosses over the annular ligament, and is inserted into the pisi- form bone, and by a vertical slip into the head of the fifth metacarpal bone. Relations.—It is only covered by the fascia, and lies on the ulnar nerve, artery, flexor sublimis, ulna, pro- nator quadratus, and annular ligament, from which a bursa separates it; from the outer edge of this tendon a process passes to the annular ligament, to bind doAvn the ulnar nerve and artery; sometimes this process is considered as a superficial stratum of theligament, which

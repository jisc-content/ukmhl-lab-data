691 CERVICAL PLEXUS. the third, and likewise sends off a small branch of com- munication to the fifth cervical. It is not, however, to be supposed that the formation of the plexus consists simply of a single communication between the several nerves that compose it, the filaments of connexion being generally double, but always extremely minute, and of course difEcult to be demonstrated; it likewise commu- cates with the eighth, ninth, and superior cervical gan- glion of the sympathetic. The distribution of its seve- ral branches may be greatly simplified by dividing them into a superficial and deep set, and in this manner we propose to consider them. Superficial Bhanches—These, as their name im- plies, are all cutaneous, and from their course and di- rection have been divided into ascending and descend- ing; the former consisting of the occipitalis minor, auricularis magnus, and superficialis colli; and the lat- ter of the supra-clavicular and supra-acromiaL Occipitalis Minor arises principally from the second nerve, and arches upwards, parallel and close to the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, resting upon the splenius at first, then on the occipito-frontalis, and co- vered by the skin and fascia; it gives off branches backwards to anastomose with the great occipital, and a few filaments forwards to unite with the posterior auri- cular, both sets freely supplying the integuments, but giving no twigs to any of the muscles. Auricularis Magnus arises from the loop of connex- ion between the second and third cervical, passes at first backwards, till it reaches the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, around which it winds, and then turns forwards to rest on its external surface; it now ascends parallel but posterior to the external jugular vein, lying between the layers of the superficial fascia, and having a flattened appearance. Having arrived at the lower edge of the parotid, it throws off several fine filaments to that gland, some of which can be traced to the skin of the face, and then divides into two principal branches,—a superficial and deep; the former ascends through the notch between the lobule and tragus, and breaks up into numerous filaments for the supply of the skin of the inner part of the concha, while the lat-

COSTAL SYSTEM. 327 fracturing the ribs, and turning them outwards, and then tearing off the pleura. The Costal System consists of levatores costarum, intercostals, infracostals, and triangulares sterni mus- cles. Levatokes Costarum consist of twelve pairs of small triangular muscles; each arises from the posterior part of the extreme point of the transverse process of each vertebrse, commencing at the seventh cervical, and ter- minating at the eleventh dorsal; passes downwards and outwards, becoming broader, and is inserted into each rib between the tubercle and angle at its upper edge. Relations.â€”They are covered by sacro-lumbalis, lon- gissimus dorsi, and serrati, and lie on the external layer of intercostals. Action To elevate the ribs. Intercostales consist of twenty-two pairs, eleven on each side, forming an internal and external layer; they arise from the margin of the rib above, tendinous, and are inserted into the margins of the rib below, also ten- dinous; the fibres of the external run downwards and forwards; those of the internal downwards and back- wards ; in the antero-posterior direction the two layers are of equal extent, the external commencing at the transverse process, or costo-vertebral articulation, and terminating at the cartilage, a strong aponeurotic ex- pansion being substituted as far as the sternum: the in- ternal layer commences at the angle of the rib, and is continued as far as the sternum. The First Intercostal is the widest, and more tendi- nous than any of the succeeding; there occurs a slight di- minution in width as far as the ninth, most evident pos- teriorly, where sometimes they are scarcely visible, es- pecially in old age, on account of the descent of the ribs; the tenth and eleventh are thick and fleshy, wide both behind and before; and in the latter situation we have seen them continuous with the posterior vertical fibres of the internal oblique. Relations Covered anteriorly by the great and lesser pectoral muscles, serratus magnus, and the external ob- lique ; behind by the trapezius, latissimus dorsi and ser- rati ; in contact externally with the pleura, the trian-

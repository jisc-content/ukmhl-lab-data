II DURA MATER. 607 vessels (principally veins) which are still permeable on the sides and the anterior posterior part; the an- terior, middle, and posterior meningeal ramifications spread over the surface, to which they intimately adhere, and near to the mesian line the glandulte Pacchioni occur, these small bodies being granulated on the sur- face, and divisible into three sets, namely,—external, middle, and internal; they differ much in shape, size, and number, being conical, flattened, or hemispherical; larger in old age than in the adult, and totally absent in the infant; their surface rough and granular, gene- rally of a light pink tinge, but in very old subjects per- fectly pale; they arise from the pia mater on the sur- face of the brain, carry the arachnoid, which is pale and opaque, for some distance on their surface, absorb the dura mater, and continue to increase until they come in contact with the bone, which they likewise absorb, pro- ducing deep pits or hollows, in many cases even ex- tending to the diploe. Bichat believed their origin to be connected with chronic inflammation of the membranes, an opinion receiving some confirmation from the exis- tence of opacity of the arachnoid in their vicinity. The external or osteal set are the largest and most nume- rous, some being seen on the surface, whilst others are in the process of absorption, merely making their appear- ance through the membrane; the middle occupy two situations, namely, between the layers of the dura ma- ter and within the cavity of the superior longitudinal sinus; the third, or most internal, are found on the sur- face of the brain, some free and others connecting the visceral and parietal layers of arachnoid together. The use of these bodies is unknown. In the middle line of the dura mater a longitudinal depression is observed, which corresponds to that sinus, which should now be ex- amined, and this may be done by opening it with a pair of scissors from before backwards. Superior Longitudinal Sinus.—This is a venous canal extending from the ethmoid to the occipital bone, situated in the convex margin of the falx cerebri, and corresponding to the mesian line of the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones; it is much larger behind than be- fore, and a section shows its cavity to be triangular in

828 ARTERIES AND VEINS. nutritious artery of the bone, and sometimes -with the superior profunda, Anastomotica Magna.—Variable in size; arises about an inch and a half above the internal condyle, and passes directly inwards under the median nerve, and on the brachialis anticus; and on reaching the inner edge of the latter divides into two branches,—a descending and transverse: the former passing downwards under the pronator teres, and on the brachialis anticus anas- tomoses with the anterior ulnar recurrent; while the latter, piercing the internal intermuscular septum, com- municates with the inferior profunda. Anomalies.—It may arise from the brachial by two distinct trunks, each of which will then pursue the course indicated above. Radial Artery must in direction be considered as the direct continuation of the brachial, though it is always inferior in size to the ulnar, with which it arises in common a little above the coronoid process, and pass- ing at first vertically downwards as far as the upper edge of the annular ligament (first stage or vertical), then winds backwards to the dorsum of the hand, and ultimately through the first interosseous space to its palmar aspect (oblique stage), where it divides into its ultimate branches. Relations—First ^'to^/e—Anteriorly, integument, las- cia twio-s of external cutaneous nerve and intermus- cular septum; posteriorly, tendon of biceps, supinator brevis and branches of musculo-spiral nerve, tendon ot pronator teres, radial attachment of flexor sublimis, tendon of the flexor pollicis longus and pronator qua- dratus; externally, supinator longus and radial nerve for its upper two-thirds; and internally, pronator teres tor its upper third, and flexor carpi radialis lor its two inferior. ^ . ^ ^ Second ^tor/e.—Posteriorly, tendons of extensor ossis metacarpi, primi intcrnodii, and, after crossing the in- ixn-ular space intercepted between those tendons, secun- di ^intcrnodii pollicis, ultimately the abductor mdicis, anteriorly, external lateral ligament, back of caq^us, occasionally tendon of extensor carpi radialis longior, and adductor pollicis.

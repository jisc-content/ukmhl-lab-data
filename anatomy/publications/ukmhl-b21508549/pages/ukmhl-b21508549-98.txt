88 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. gives origin to the muscle of the same name; its inner is marked more strikingly by mammillary eminences and digital depressions than in the bones already de- scribed, and is separated from the petrous by a narrow, wavy groove, extending in a direction backwards and outwards. Its margin, particularly superiorly, is be- villed off to overlap the parietal bone, forming the squa- mous suture, and it forms the outer boundary of the middle fossa of the cranium. The zygomatic arch is a process of bone, a little more than an inch in length, cut off obliquely on its under surface, and serrated so as to rest on the malar, stretching backwards to a tu- bercle, where it bifurcates into its two roots; its upper edge is thin and sharp, giving attachment to the tem- poral fascia; its lower, thicker, to the parotidian apo- neurosis; its internal surface is concave and smooth for the temporal muscle to glide behind it to its inser- tion; its external, convex, for the origin of the deep por- tion of the masseter and zygomaticUs major. The tu- bercle which limits it posteriorly is generally well marked for the attachment of the external lateral liga- ment; bifurcating at this point into its two roots, the horizontal and transverse,â€”the former stretching back- wards towards the mastoid portion, where it becomes gradually lost, the latter extending inwards and slightly backwards, more elevated and rounded, wider internally than externally, they enclose the glenoid cavity, an oval depression; long from before backwards and inwards, divided by theGlaserian fissure, which runs forwards and inwards into two parts, the anterior, larger, and concave for the condyle ofthelower jaw, the posterior, smaller and flatter, lodging a process of the parotidian gland, the glenoid. The Glaserian fissure is remarkable for afi'ord- ing attachment to the capsular ligament, and it is said to give passage to the Vidian nerve and laxator tympani muscle, but improperly, as Ave have always observed the former to emerge internal to it, and the latter ought rather to be considered as a band of fibrous tissue stretching from the spinous process of the sphenoid to the point of the processus gracilis of the malleus,_ which terminates within the lips of the fissure. Behind the glenoid cavity are two processes, the styloid and vaginal,

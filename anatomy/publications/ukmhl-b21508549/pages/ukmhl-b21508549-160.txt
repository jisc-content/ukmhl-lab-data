THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 150 importance in breaking shocks transmitted to the ver- tebral column. It is likewise of use in bestowing faci- lity of motion, and in imparting elasticity and supple- Bess to this fundamental portion of the human body. The best method, and indeed the only true one, of examining the peculiarities which the disc presents in the several regions of the spine, is to make a vertical section in the antero-posterior direction, from the se- cond vertebra to the second bone of the sacrum. On directing our attention to the cut surfaces, we will ob- serve a greater thickness in the lumbar region, its wedge-like form, with the base turned anteriorly, espe- cially conspicuous between the last vertebra and first bone of the sacrum, where its posterior thin margin is fined o& to a striking degree of tenuity. In the dorsal region, on the contrary, there is a sensible decrease in the vertical height of this substance, while the base of the wedge is directed backwards; in the cervical again the gradual diminution in depth still continues, but it follows the arrangement observable in the lumbar, in being deeper before than behind. Thus the alternating changes in the position of these wedge-like discs are in a great measure the cause of the normal curvatures which are observed in the spine, the abnormal ones likewise depending in a great measure upon their irregu- lar development. The Anterior Vaginal, or Common Ligament, is si- tuated on the front of the vertebral column, extending from the body of the second cervical vertebra to the upper part of the first bone of the sacrum; it is of a pearly- white colour, and consists of three distinct bands,â€”a median, and two lateral, separated by imperfect inter- vals, through which the vessels pass in their course to the bone. Maceration proves that it forms two, some- times three, planes of fibres, the deeper set attached to the lips of two contiguous vertebrae, and an intervening intervertebral disc, while the more superficial extends over three, four, or five; their connexion to the bodies of the bone is very slight, so much so that the handle of the scalpel can be sometimes passed between them and the ligament, but it is far otherwise with respect to its attachment to the margins of the bone and the

The inferior maxilla articulates with one bone only of the head, the temporal, and has two proper fora- mina, the openings of the dental canal. Its processes are also two,—the coronoid and condyloid. It has also two points of ossification for each lateral portion,—one for the mass of the bone in general, the other for the inner border of the dental groove. Ossification takes place very early in this bone from the fourth to the fifth week; and the alveolar portion, which we have stated was distinct, becomes united to the other about the seventh or eighth. We have already alluded to the changes which it undergoes at the several periods of life, modifying the character of its angle; and we will merely state that the ridges we have described on the outer and inner surfaces of its sides, stretching ob- liquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, seem to di- vide them into two distinct parts,—a superior or alveo- lar, constituting about two-thirds in depth of the bone anteriorly; and an anterior or basilar, the foundation on which the entire bone appears to be built. THE TEETH. The teeth are divided into permanent and temporary or deciduous, and are variously considered to apper- tain to the neural and dermal skeletons; they are sixteen in number in each jaw, and divisible into four incisors, two canine, and ten molares. Each tooth has

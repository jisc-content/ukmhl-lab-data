518 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. auriculo-ventricular opening, and the origin of the pul- monary artery. Carney Columns These are smooth, fleshy bands, on the internal surface of the ventricle, consisting of three sets: the first, which are the more numerous, be- ing attached by their extremities and free in the centre; they cross the surface in every conceivable direction, producing that reticulated appearance known as the cavernous structure of the right ventricle—a character more evident on the anterior wall and apex than on the septum; the second set, larger, ilatter, and less nu- merous, are attached to the wall of the ventricle by one surface in its whole extent; these we have seen most frequently on the septum, whilst a flat, strong band, described by Mr. T. W. King, also passes backwards and towards the right side, attached in front to the an- terior and behind to the septal wall of the cavity; it will at once be observed that this muscular fasciculus not only draws the anterior wall towards the septum but likewise urges the blood with much energy into the arterial outlet; the third set of fleshy columns are called musculipappillares, wide, thick, and exceedingly strong; they are attached by one extremity to the wall of the ventricle, and by the second to the chordae tendmes, which again connect them to the valves. CHORDiE Tendine^.—These are fine, threadlike fibres, surrounded by a serous layer, white, glistenmg and sil- very they are attached by one extremity to the fleshy columns, and by the second to the margins ot the valves, being prolonged on their surface (external) as far as the auricular opening, but occasionally we have seen mus- cular fibres continued on the surface ol the cords even to their valvular attfichment. . j Tricuspid VALVES.-Three in number, are situated within the ventricle formed by a double layer of the serous lining of the heart with an intervening fibrous stratum • of these, one is anterior and right, the second poster^;, and the third to the left side; each valve pre- sents eTther a quadrilateral or irregularly triangular rare with twolmrgins, and a similar number ot sur- Stthe superior inargin is attached to ^^^^ --^^^^^^ tendinous zone, from which a process is continued be

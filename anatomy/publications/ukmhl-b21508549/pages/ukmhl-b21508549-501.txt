491 PLEURA. Now' let the ribs be sawed nearly through about their centres, and then bend them backwards; this will facilitate the further examination of the contents. The pleuree are double sacs of serous membrane, each being distinct and confined to a single side, and as shut sacs consist of a parietal and visceral layer ; the former lining and adhering to the inclosing walls, the latter reflected around the contained parts, one surface being attached, rough and fibrous; the second internal, free and smooth, lubricated by a vapour or halitus, exhaled by its surface. The perfect continuity of the membrane may be understood by following its several reflections. Thus from the posterior surface of the sternum the pleura passes backwards and inwards to the fore-part and sides of the pericardium, thus forming the lateral boundaries of the anterior mediastinum; from the latter point it is reflected over the anterior face of the root of the lung, which conducts it to its internal or concave surface, until it reaches the thin or free edge; then over the convex surface lining the pulmonary fissures, until the poste- rior or thick margin is reached, and thence to the back of the root; from this it passes to the posterior and lateral part of the pericardium, where it is nearest to the opposite sac, is then reflected on the sides of the bodies of the vertebrte,â€”thus constituting the lateral wall of the posterior mediastinum; it next lines the concavities of the ribs, here becoming continuous with the membrane whei'e the sac was first opened; supe- riorly it forms a cul de sac, passing higher on the right side than the left, and below it covers and adheres to the superior surface of the diaphragm, a fold or process here connecting the diaphragmatic layer with the pulmo- nary, termed ligamentum latum pulmonis; this is of an oblong figure, narrow in the centre, wide above and below; attached superiorly to the lower edge of the root of the lung; inferiorly to the diaphragm; externally it is free; and internally, connected to the pericardium. The Pleura consists of a surface layer of squamous epithelium, supported on a fine semitransparent basement membrane, the areolar tissue subjacent to the last forming in some situations a dense fibrous layer, con- ferring on the pleura the compound character of a sero-

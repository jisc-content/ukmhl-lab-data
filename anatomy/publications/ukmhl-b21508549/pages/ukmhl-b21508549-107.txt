THE SPHENOID, 97 poro-zygomatic surface is remarkable for its curved appearance; long and convex from above downwards and inwards, narrow and concave from before back- wards. It is divided a little below the centre by an horizontal elevated crest into two portions, a superior or temporal, and an inferior or zygomatic. The supe- rior is wedged in between the temporal and parietal behind, and the malar and frontal in front, and forms part of the temporal fossa; bounded below by the crest already alluded to, which gives attachment to the tem- poral and outer head of the external pterygoid muscle; the inferior is more concave, quadrilateral in shape; bounded in front by a ridge of bone, prolonged from the root of the external pterygoid plate; above by the crest, while posteriorly and externally it presents a sharp-pointed angle, which is fitted into the interval between the squamous and petrous portions of the tem- poral bone. It forms the roof of the zygomatic fossa, and is perforated by two foramina, the oval anteriorly and the spinous posteriorly; in front of and behind the last mentioned are two small processes, one oblong and sharp, the spinous; the other broader, but thin, the styloid; these give attachment to the laxator tympani muscle, and the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw. The internal or orbital surface is of a diamond figure, flat and smooth, looking forwards and inwards, forming the principal portion of the external wall of the orbit; its superior edge is rough and thick, to ar- ticulate with the frontal; its anterior, likewise rough, but thin, to unite with the malar; its inferior smooth, rounded, and free, forming the outer boundary of the spheno-maxillary fissure; its posterior likewise non- articular, but thin, constituting the inferior wall of the foramen lacerum orbitale, for the transmission of the several nerves to the orbit. As we proceed down- wards and backwards from the orbital, we find a flat portion of the bone terminating below in the roots of the pterygoid processes; it is quadrilateral in shape, forms the posterior boundary of the pterygo-maxil- lary fossa, and is perforated by two foramina; the supe- rior, the external opening of the foramen rotundum â€¢ F

THE SPHENOID. 95 forwards, a triangular plate of bone for uniting with the vomer, which is split to receive it posteriorly, and with the nasal lamella of the ethmoid anteriorly, where the tongue-like prolongation of the triangular fibro-cartilage of the nose is also attached to it; this is called the ros- trum or azygos process; on either side of it is a deep furrow, partially overlapped by a thin lamella of bone, under which the edges of the vomer are implanted. The anterior extremity of the body has springing from it the ethmoidal spine already alluded to, descending from which is a thin crest becoming continuous with the rostrum below; it forms the septum between two holes on either side, the openings into the sphenoidal sinuses, which extend into the body, and occasionally into the lesser wings, consisting of several minute com- partments, separated from each other by thin laminse; the lower wall of these holes is completed by two small curved slips of bone which connect it to the palate, the turbinated bones of Bertin; external to this the bone is rough to articulate with the orbital process of the palate. If we now direct our attention to the sides of the body we will find that the lesser wings, or wings of Ingrassius, spring from them anteriorly and superiorly; below these it is smooth and concave from above down- wards, forming part of the inner wall of the orbit, and the internal boundary or base of the lacerated or- bital foramen; posterior to this it is smooth, and de- scends obliquely downwards and outwards to terminate in the greater wing, forming the internal wall of the cavernous sinus; still more posteriorly it is marked by a shallow groove for the passage of the internal carotid, while inferiorly the greater wing springs from it by a broad thick root. We will now proceed to the examina- tion of those wings. The lesser wing is of a triangular shape, with the apex directed forwards and outwards; the base inwards and slightly backwards, connected to the body by two roots, one anterior and superior, broad and strong, the other inferiorly and posteriorly, much thinner and weaker, separated bya round foramen, the optic; the base terminates behind in a tuberculated pro- cess,â€”the posterior clinoid, which gives attachment to the concave margin of the tentorium; the upper sur-

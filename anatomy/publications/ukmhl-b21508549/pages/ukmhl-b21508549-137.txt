127 ZYGOMATIC FOSSA, tube, directly anteriorly by the middle meningeal ar- tery and internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and externally by the vaginal process of the temporal bone. On the outer side of the carotid foramen is the glenoid cavity, oval in shape, concave, and covered with cartilage; bounded anteriorly by the transverse root of the zygoma, externally by its horizontal root and auditory process, posteriorly by the styloid and vaginal processes of the temporal bone, and internally by the spinous and styloid of the sphenoid, the internal lateral ligament, and middle meningeal artery; tra- versing it from without, forwards, and inwards, we have the Glaserian fissure, for the passage of the parts already enumerated in the description of the separate bone. Between the outer edge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and great wing of the sphenoid is a groove, directed backwards and outwards; it termi- nates in an osseous canal, which, about three-quarters of an inch in length, forms the bony portion of the Eustachian tube. From this point, as we have already premised, it will be necessary for us to consider the remainder of the ex- ternal part of the cranium in connexion with the face, for the two are so completely blended with each other in the formation of the several fossa regions and cavi- ties, that to separate them would be only to render a subject already intricate still more complicated. We shall therefore be content to observe, that the face, taken as a whole, is of a triangular shapeâ€”its base su- periorly; its greatest vertical measurement being from above downwards, between the nasal spine of the fron- tal bone and the lowest part of the symphisis menti; its greatest transverse between the prominence of the malar bones. Its lower or guttural surface would be mapped out by a line extending backwards from the lower part of the symphisis, in the direction of the foramen magnum; it is extremely irregular, as we shall presently observe; the upper becomes completely blended with the lower and anterior part of the cranium. We will now proceed to describe in detail these several parts, commencing with the inferior surface. The zygomatic fossa is common both to the head

277 PHARYNX. the carotid artery and jugular vein, but separated from them by the superior cervical ganglion of the sympa- thetic. The petro-pharyngeal portion is directed from before, backwards, attached to the petrous portion of the temporal bone external to the levator palati and Eusta- chian tubes, passing forwards and downwards, it splits into two layers, to form the pterygo-pharyngeal por- tion, one of which is attached to the posterior lip of the internal pterygoid plate on the internal side of the ten- sor palati; the other, much stronger, to the crest which bounds internally the navicular fossa; on the internal side of the last-named muscle, at the hamular process, these unite and descend to the inner side of the root of the coronoid process of the lower jaw as the pterygo- maxillary ligament or bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis, but still it can be traced to the mylo-hyoid ridge of the lower jaw, constituting another origin of the constrictor, and with good reason should be named mylo-pharyngeal process; through the instrumentality of this continuous hbrous sheet, the superior constrictor is attached, but anteriorly it has an additional connexion to the side of the base of the tongue, as the glosso-pharyngeal muscle. It therefore arises from the side of the base of the tongue, from the posterior third of the mylo-hyoid ridge, from the pterygo-maxillary ligament, hamular pro- cess, and internal pterygoid plate, from the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone, and cuneiform process of the occipital; the fibres run in curv-es between the several points of attachment, the concavities directed upwards; and in the intervals of the fixed points certain parts are found; thus, between the maxillary and pterygoid at- tachments the internal pterygoid muscle and gustatory nerve are seen, and in the interval between the ptery- goid and petrosal, the muscles of the palate and Eusta- chian tube are placed; and lastly, between the petrous and occipital, two semilunar spaces are situated, bounded above by the occipital bone, where the muscular tissue is deficient, allowing the fibrous aponeurosis to become visible. The Extrinsic Muscles are the stylo-pharyngei and palato-pharyngei ; the former have been already described; the latter will be examined with the palate.

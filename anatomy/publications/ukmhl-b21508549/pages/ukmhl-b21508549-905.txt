895 ABSORBENTS. efferentia), these small vessels being often confounded witli collapsed venous branches, from which they differ, however, in the following respects:â€”The lymphatic coats are thinner than those of veins, their valves more regular and numerous, and they do not unite to form larger trunks, as veins do, but run separately, though often in juxtaposition, towards the glands, while they do not communicate so freely. The struc- ture of the lymphatic glands is simple, consisting, first, of a capsule of a fibrous structure, which, sending sepi- menta into its interior, gives it a cellular appearance on being divided, and the lymphatics enter its substance and form convoluted tubes, which possibly may also send off lateral cellular diverticula, then emerging as the vasa efferentia, whilst within the gland the tubes lose the areolar tunic, nothing but a basement layer, supporting a stratum of very opaque epithelium, con- stituting their walls; it has likewise been maintained, that the glandular lymphatics communicated with the veins and small arteries (Fohman, Abernethy). The lymphatics commence on the surface and in the sub- stance of parts, but their exact origins have never been discovered; but the lacteals restricted to the intestines can be examined with greater success. They have been seen arising from the villi, but their arrangement in those parts is still undecided, it being described as plexiform (Rudolphi), looped (Goodsir), a closed, di- lated ampulla (Henle), and lastly, by open mouths, which is obviously incorrect. The structure of the lymphatics and lacteals may be inferred from that of the thoracic duct, which has an areolar tunic with irregular fibres, also a second, consisting of circular, elastic, and non-striped muscular fibre and a lining serous mem- brane, which is thrown into valves resembling those of the veins, but more numerous and regular, giving to the lymphatic vessels, when inflated, a knotted appear- ance, the epithelial lining consisting of spindle-shaped particles. The Absorbents are divided into superficial and deep sets, and the glands are subject to a similar division, but not in all organs, as their existence, although it may be inferred, has never been proved in the bones,

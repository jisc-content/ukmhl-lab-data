MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. 457 behind the internal condyle of the femur, and then ex- panding, curves forwards to be inserted into the inter- nal and anterior part of the tibia, inferior and posterior to the sartorius. Relations.—It lies on the adductors, longus, brevis, and magnus, on the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint, from which it is separated by a bursa, and lastly, on the tibia, a prolongation being sent off from each margin, above to cover the synovial membrane, and below to the fascia of the leg; it is covered by the fascia lata, the crus penis above, and below by the sartorius; the internal saphenous vein crosses its anterior edge. The deep surface receives a branch from the obturator nerve. Pectineus.—Triangular in shape; base above—apex below; it arises from the linea ileo-pectinea, between the ilio-pubal eminence and the spine of that bone, also from the surface below that line and from the pubic fascia, which covers it; the fibres pass downwards, back- wards, and outwards, converging, and are inserted by a tendon into the line leading from the lesser trochanter to the linea aspera, below the iliacus internus and above the adductor brevis. Relations.—It is covered by the pubic portion of the fascia lata and femoral vein at the pubic attachment, and near the insertion by the femoral and profunda vessels; the inner edge corresponds to the adductor longus, from which it is separated by some distance, inferiorly the adductor brevis intervening, and occasionally the first perforating artery; externally to the psoas, iliacus, cap- sular ligament, and vastus internus, and it lies on the bone, obturator externus, obturator nerve and artery, and a variable portion of the adductor brevis. When the limb is rotated inwards, the tendon of this muscle appears twisted, but this disappears during the opposite motion. The fibres are weak and fine, with but a small amount of areolar tissue in their intervals; the sheath is also thin and weak, and it is not unusual to observe It torn completely across in many subjects. Action—To flex, adduct, and rotate the thigh out- wards. Adductor LoNGus.^This muscle is the most super- ficial of the three of that name, and is triangular in X

501 POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM. veloped, which augment and multiply the tubules. These again are surrounded by a parenchymatous areolar tis- sue, that forms the nidus for the further development of successive repetitions of the cell and tubular elements of the lung. The pulmonary vessels ramify in the pa- renchyma of the cells, but as these vessels in foetal life contain but a small amount of blood, it would seem that they merely provide for structural increase during that period, a process which continues until the forty- fifth year. The student should now proceed with the examina- tion of the posterior mediastinum, and for this purpose the right lung may be removed at its root, and the pleura cautiously torn from the ribs and vertebree; then, by drawing the pericardium towards the left side, and retaining it in that position with hooks, and removing some areolar tissue, the parts in this region will be ex- posed. The posterior mediastinum is of an irregular triangular figure, bounded posteriorly by the bodies of the vertebra;, extending from the third to the tenth dor- sal, also by the anterior vaginal ligament, which clothes the anterior surface of those bones; anteriorly, by the pericardium, which forms the apex of the space; and laterally by the pleura as it passes from the posterior and lateral part of the pericardium to the bodies of the vertebra. Within this space a number of parts are in- closed, supported in their position by the spinal column, and having different relations to each other in the up- per and lower division of the mediastinum. On the right side are seen the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves; mternal to these, the vena azygos; still nearer to the mesian line, the thoracic duct; next in order the aorta; after this, and to its left side, the cEsophagus, with the pneumogastric nerves; the vena azygos minor follows; and lastly, the left greater and lesser splanch- nic nerves; the right intercostal arteries, with the left intercostal veins, are contained within its limits, but tthe trachea divides at its superior boundary, and' can- not therefore be said to lie within the mediastinum if accurately localized.

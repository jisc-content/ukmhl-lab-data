TEMPORO-MAXILLARY ARTICULATION. 213 from being compressed against the jaw by the action of the internal pterygoid, as it is too weak and too lax to accomplish such an object against the contraction of such a powerful muscle; neither can it be supposed to be placed there solely to conduct the middle meningeal artery to its destination, but in foetal existence, where the jaw consisted of two distinct pieces, it with the ex- ternal might have formed a species of sling for its sup- port, and preserved the condyle in proper contiguity with the glenoid cavity. Capsular Ligament.—This is barrel-shaped and loose, in order to permit free motion of the jaw; it is attached above, anteriorly to the transverse root of the zygoma; externally to its horizontal; posteriorly to the Glaserian fissure, and internally to the roots of the spinous and styloid processes of the sphenoid bone; below it encir- cles the neck of the jaw, which it tensely embraces; its degree of strength is very variable,—thus it is found to be very strong and dense anteriorly and externally, but internally and posteriorly it is weaker and thinner; it is perforated in front and on its inner side by the ex- ternal pterygoid, as it passes to its insertion into the interarticular fibro-cartilage. Interartjcular Fibro-cartilage This is oval in shape, thick at the edges, but extremely thin, often per- forated in the centre; its upper surface is concavo-con- vex,—concave anteriorly, where it rests on the trans- verse root of the zygoma; convex posteriorly, where it corresponds to and fills up the glenoid cavity; its infe- rior surface is deeply concave, and moulded on the up- per part of the condyle, to which it is closely united by the reflection of the inferior sac of the synovial mem- brane, strengthened by a little scattered fibrous tissue; this, as well as the attachment of the external pterygoid' muscle, insures its following the condyle in all its mo- tions, thus guarding against the displacement to which it would be so liable from the action of the powerful muscles which are connected to it. Synovial Membrane. — This, generally speaking, consists of two distinct processes, separated from each other by the cartilage; the superior is remarkable for its laxity, the inferior for its tensity; they occasionally communicate through the foramen in the cartilage.

CEREBRAL NERVES. Q>J^ 2 G 2 that name, terminates in the integument, during its course gmng off a branch to communicate with the portio dura, also filaments to the temporo-maxillarv articulation; while the inferior branch passes down- wards and forms a plexus on the internal maxillary ar- tery, the filaments composing it presenting ganglionic enlargements at intervals, and sending twicrg to the pa rotid lobe of the ear, temporo-maxiUar j articulation, and a branch of communication to the auricularis magnus Inferior DENTAL.-Larger than the gustatory, with which It arises in common; descends between the two 1 pterygoid muscles, then passes downwards and forwards I between the internal lateral ligament and the ramus of : the jaw the former separating it from the internal ptery- ,goid then entering the posterior orifice of the dental .canal, and coursing through it beneath the molar teeth lit arrives at the mental foramen, where it divides into ttwo branches,_one, the mental, escaping through that mperture, and passing between the triangularis oris and guadratus menti, divides into a number of diver^in^ ^laments, of which some pierce the quadratus, and ar! distributed to the mucous membrane of the lower lin vwhilst others, remaining superficial, are lost in the in- 'tegument communicating with the portio dura- the continuation of the trunk passes beneath the incisor loeeth (mcisor branch), being extremely small, and ter- imiuates at the symphisis menti. The dental branch •luring Its whole course, gives off filaments which enter '.he foramina m the fangs of both molar, canine and .ncisor teeth, terminating in the dentinal pulp and an addition to the mental, this nerve in^eJe lLs off -vigs to the pterygoid muscles, also a branch'of com- nunication to the gustatory, and just as it is about to inter the dental canal it throws off the— Myloid. Branch that enters a groove in the ramus •f the jaw, in which it ,s bound down by a process of hie internal lateral ligament, and emerging from be ■eath the anterior edge of the internal pterygoid it :^nkes the posterior margin of the mylo-hyoid, which it applies on Its upper surface, as well as the genio-hvoid • •hilst a branch passes on the lower aspect of that mus- '-e, sending filaments to the anterior belly of the digas-

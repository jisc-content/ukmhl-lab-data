THE EAR. 7gy hollow canal or tube, winding around it for two turns and a half, but in such a manner that each inferior coil overlaps that which is immediately above it, an arrancrg- ment which has necessarily a tendency to render the cochlea of a conical figure. In order that a more intel- ligible view may be obtained of this complicated struc- ture, we will describe each of its component parts indi- vidually. Modiolus or Axis—This is of an irregular conical hgure. Its base turned internally, and appearing in the bottom of the internal auditory meatus, its apex di- rected outwards, and slightly downwards and forwards terminating m a dilated process (scyphus), resembling m shape a cup, but only inferiorly, as it is deficient superiorly, where it presents a smooth margin for its entire extent. The base exhibits numerous foramina tor the entrance of the auditory nerve, which, piercing the bone, runs m numerous canals through its struc- ture, and throws off several fine filaments to the external surface, for the supply of the scalar, while its continued trunk, reduced to a mere thread, emerges from the bony tubules in which it was contained, in the centre of the lunnel-shaped depression at its apex. The surface ot the modiolus is also deeply grooved in a spiral manner llmTna *° attachment of the spiral Tube of the Cochlea or Lamina Gyrorum.—This is a tube about one inch and a quarter in length, if mea- sured on Its external or convex wall, but much shorter on Its internal or concave; neither is it of the same ca- liber throughout, for while at its internal part it is about one-tenth of an inch in diameter, at its external it is scarcely one-sixteenth. Its first coil encircles the expanded base_ of the modiolus, overlapping and be- coming fused with that immediately above it, and thus it continues to ascend, forming two turns and a half, gra- dually decreasing in size till it reaches its apex. Tra versing this tube from one extremity to the other and dividing It into two secondary ones, is a thin plate partly osseous and partly cartilaginous,—the lamina smi rahs, commencing at the fenestra rotunda, and winding around the modiolus, following exactly the coils of

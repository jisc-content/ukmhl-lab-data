643 MEDULLA OBLONGATA. Gall and Spurzheim conceived to be the ganglion of the cerebellum. The arbor vitss of the middle lobe consists of a triangular white nucleus, which is continued up- wards into the superior, and downwards into the in- ferior vermiform process, dividing and subdividing into branches and smaller branches as they pass to the sur- face, where they are surrounded by a yellow layer and grey substance, similar to the arrangement of the same parts in the lateral lobes. Medulla Oblongata, or Rachidian Bulb, consists of a conoid enlargement, extending from the pons va- rolii above to the upper margin of the anterior half arch of the atlas below, where it is a little constricted, measuring in length from fifteen to sixteen lines, nine in breadth, and six in thickness, being much greater in diameter than the spinal cord; its direction is oblique, and therefore forms an obtuse angle with the spinal cord, salient posteriorly; inferiorly it rests on the ba- silar process of the occipital bone, and also corresponds to the vertebral arteries; superiorly and posteriorly it is related to the fourth ventricle and valley of Haller. It consists of four bodies, which are symmetrical,—namely, the anterior pyramids in front, the olivary bodies late- rally, the restiform posteriorly and laterally, and the posterior pyramids behind. Anterior Pyramids occupy the anterior part of the medulla, triangular in shape, and about an inch in length, each commencing, narrow and pointed, below by threesetsof fibres,—namely, decussating, non-decussat- mg, and arciform: the first consists of from three to five fasciculi, which sink into the anterior sulcus to become continuous with the antero-lateral columns of the cord on the opposite side; external to these the second set are prolonged to the anterior column of its own side whilst the arciform fibres, being still more external, pass backwards below the olivary body, which they sometimes cover, and are continuous with the posterior columns Above the point of decussation the median fissure se- parates these bodies, and when they are gently drawn asunder the inner edge appears dentated in consequence of the impressions of the vessels lying in the pia mater ■which sinks into the fissure. Just as they are about to

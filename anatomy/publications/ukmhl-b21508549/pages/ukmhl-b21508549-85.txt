THE METATARSAL BONES. sal bones; their anterior, also espanded, but rounded, to articulate with the first phalanx. The shaft is con- stricted and prismatic, narrow above and below; con- cave inferiorly, convex superiorly; the sides flattened and opposed to each other, and giving origin to the in- terossei muscles. If we now examine the peculiarities which each presents, we will find them to be the follow- ing:â€”The first may be at once distinguished by its greater shortness and thickness; its posterior extremity is marked by a large, oval, concave facette, where it unites with the internal cuneiform bone; externally a small articulating surface is visible on it, where it is in contact with the second metatarsal bone; superiorly and internally it affords insertion to the tibialis anti- cus; inferiorly and externally is a tubercle, for the attachment of the tendon of the peronseus longus, while the rest of its circumference is rough for the ligaments which connect it to the internal cuneiform posteriorly; its shaft is remarkable for its extreme thickness; while its anterior extremity, rounded and covered with cartilage, to articulate Avith the first phalanx, pre- sents on either side two tubercles, for the attachment of the lateral ligaments which connect it to that bone. The second metatarsal bone is remarkable for its great length, which results from the manner in Avhich'^it is wedged in between the three cuneiform bones; present^ ing not only a concave facette on its posterior extre- mity, for articulation with the second, but likewise smaller ones on each side, where it is in contact with the first and third, as well as with the corresponding meta- tarsal bones. The upper part of its tarsal extremity is broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments; its lower marked by a small tubercle, for the insertion of an offset of the peroneal tendon. Its shaft is thin and prismatic, and terminates in a head of the same shape, but smaller than that of the preceding. ' The third metatarsal bone is shorter than the last and like it, has three facettes posteriorly: one on its extremity, triangular, but nearly flat, for articulation with the third cuneiform bone, and one on either side, for the adjacent metatarsal bones. Its upper surface is E 2

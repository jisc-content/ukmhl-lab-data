DURA MATER. 6li cular Heropliili, in the former situation being sometimes double, and not unfrequently a few glandule Pacchioni are seen in this situation. "We have never observed any cerebellar veins communicating directly with it in any point, which leads us to consider it merely as the con- tinuation of the inferior longitudinal and veins of Galen. Tentorium Cerebelli.â€”Stretched as a platform be- tween the cerebrum and cerebellum, and is somewhat se- milunar in shape; it presents for description two mar- gins, two surfaces, and an aperture. The convex margin, thick and bifid, is attached to the crucial ridge of the occipital bone and the lips of the transverse sulcus of the same, to the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, mastoid, and petrous portions of the temporal; and lastly, to the posterior clinoid processes of the sphenoid. The concave edge is free except at its terminal points, which, gliding over the convex margin, are attached to the anterior clinoid processes, thus circumscribing a semilunar aperture, bounded posteriorly and laterally by the tentorium, and anteriorly by the clivus basis cranii, into which project the pons varolii and superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, whilst it gives passage to the crura cerebri and basilar artery, in this manner allowing connexion between the elements of the mesocephalon, which unite the cerebrum, cerebel- lum, and the medulla oblongata, and by the transmission of the basilar artery it likewise permits of a free com- munication between the two sources of vascular supply to the central organ of the nervous system. The supe- rior surface is convex, and directed downwards and outwards, and is suspended in the centre by the falx cerebri supporting the posterior lobes of the brain; the inferior surface, concave, receives the attachment of the falx cerebelli near its posterior margin, and corresponds to the superior surface of the lobes of the cerebellum, osseous plates being frequently found in the lamina of this process, rudimentary of the normal structure in the feline species, and these, when examined microsco- pically, always exhibit the presence of Haversian canals, a structure which we have demonstrated in a plate taken from the tentorium over the fifth pair of nerves.

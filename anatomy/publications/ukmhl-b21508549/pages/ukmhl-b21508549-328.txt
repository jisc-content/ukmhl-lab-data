THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 318 times separated with facility, and again they may be so fused as to require an artificial division to correspond with any applicable description: these consist of,—sacro- lumbalis, the mostexternal ;longissimusdorsiin the mid- dle ; and the spinalis dorsi internally. Sacro-lumbalis Narrow above and below, wide in the centre, arises by a broad, strong aponeurosis from the tubercles on the back of the sacrum and its transverse processes, from the posterior spine of the ilium, and the posterior fourth of the crest of that bone, from the spines and oblique processes of all the lumbar and three infe- rior dorsal vertebree; the fibres pass upwards and out- wards, and are inserted by flat tendinous slips into^ a ridge on the posterior surface of the angle of each rib. Now divide the sacro-lumbalis from the longissimus dorsi and turn it outwards, when a series of short apo- neurotic and fleshy fasciculi are seen, about seven in number; we have observed nine. These arise from the upper edge of the angle of each rib, and are inserted into the corresponding tendons of the sacro-lumbalis (musculi accessorii). Longissimus Dorsi Internal to the last, also arises from a strong aponeurosis, which connects it to the ridge and transverse process of the sacrum, and spines and articular eminences of the lumbar vertebrs; it ascends in the vertebral gutter, and is inserted into the articular eminences of all the dorsal vertebra, and ex- ternally by tendinous fasciculi into all the ribs internal to their angles. Spinalis Dorsl—Narrower than the last, and more internal; frequently united to it; arises tendinous from the spines of the three upper lumbar and two last dorsal vertebra, and is inserted into the spines of the remaining dorsal. It has been seen that these muscles have a common origin from a strong layer of tendon, wide below nar- row above, the internal margin straight, and firmly attached to the sacral ridge and lumbar, with three dorsal spines; the external edge curved, weak, attached externally to the transverse processes of the sacrum and posterior superior spine of the ilium; from the upper and outer edge of this the muscles arise; the fibres are

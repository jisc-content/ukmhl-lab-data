246 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ternal maxillary artery and vein, the capsular ligament, and neck of the jaw; internally it corresponds to the external pterygoid plate, which separates it from the internal pterygoid; but behind this it is in contact Avith Its posterior fibres, to the inferior maxillary nerve, its dental and gustatory branches, also temporo-auricular branch, internal lateral ligament, and middle meningeal artery. The depth of the zygomatic fossa influences the size of the muscle, it being much larger where the pterygoid plate is concave externally, and the crest of the sphenoid standing out boldly, or approximating the zygomatic arch; the two fasciculi of the muscle are se- parated by the internal maxillary artery, and it is per- forated by branches of that artery and the inferior maxillary nerve, that will be described with their pro- per systems. Actions.—To draw forwards the lower jaw, also draw in a similar direction the interarticular cartilage, so as to adapt the articular eminence to the condyle. When the jaw is depressed, this muscle is an active agent in the production of dislocation of the condyle, when as- sisted by the muscles that depress the chin; after the displacement of the bone, the muscle is in a state of tonic contraction, and certainly not relaxed, as stated by Nelaton. The production of an artificial disloca- tion in the dead subject, and an accurate examination of all the muscles in its vicinity, has satisfied us of the correctness of Sir A. Cooper's views on this subject. Pterygoideus Internus lies internal to the last, oval in shape; it arises by tendinous fibres from the internal side of the external pterygoid plate, also from the pterygoid process of the palate bone; then becom- ing broad and fleshy, it passes downwards, backAvards, and outwards, and is inserted into the internal side of the angle of the lower jaw. Relations.—Externally, it corresponds to the external pterygoid plate, external pterygoid muscle, gustatory and chorda-tympani nerves, internal lateral ligament, which separates it from the inferior dental artery and nerve, internal maxillary vessels, and a small process of the parotid gland; internally, it corresponds to the ten- sor palati, from which it is separated by a dense pro-

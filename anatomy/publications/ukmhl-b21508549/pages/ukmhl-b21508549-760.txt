Y50 NERVOUS SYSTEM. layers,â€”the external or venous (vasa vorticosa); the middle or arterial (tunica Ruyschiana); and lastly, the pigmental or coloured membrane. The venous layer, when well injected, presents a very beautitul appear- ance, these vessels running in whorls from before back- wards, and terminating in from five to seven emissory trunks, which, piercing the sclerotic coat, terramatem the ophthalmic vein. The middle layer, or tumca Ruy- schiana, is formed by the ramifications of the short ciliary arteries, whilst the membrana pigmenti consists o_t a layer of hexagonal plates of epithelium, containing pig- ment granules, composed of carbon or the oxide ot iron. On tracing the choroid coat forwards, it becomes conti- nuous with the corpus ciliare, which may be considered as being made up of the ciliary processes and ligament, with the superadded ciliary muscle. Ciliary PRocESSES.-These may be thus exposed .- After having removed the sclerotic, cut off the posterior half of the choroid and vitreous body with a scissors, and place the eye resting on the cornea on a white p ate with a little water; they will then be seen about sixty Tn number, alternately long ^^-^S^^^^^'/.'^at of plications or foldings inwards of the choroid coat each ciliary process being triangular, the base m front turned inwards and forwards, attached to the posterior surface of the iris (iridian border), the apex directed backwards and outwards, which, with the external sur- face, is continuous with the choroid, ^vhile internally they impress the surface of the vitreous body around the knsf constituting the corona ciliaris, or zonule of Z nn-, they likewise'surround the margin of the lens Tepar'atedLn it by the canal of f tit alsofoi^g th rlrcumference of the posterior chamber.

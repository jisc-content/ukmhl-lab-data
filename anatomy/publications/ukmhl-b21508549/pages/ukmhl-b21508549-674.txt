NERVOUS SYSTEM. 664 througli or between the gland and the bone, then pierce the palpebral ligament, and, descending a little, one (temporal) passes upwards and outwards, being lost in the skin on the anterior part of the temporal region, while the second, passing inwards above the ciliary margin of the lid, communicates internally with the supratrochleator to form the superior tarsal arch of nerves. The third, or communicating branch, arises at the posterior edge of the gland, and communicating with a twig of the orbital division of the superior max- illary, passes through the malar bone as the subcuta- neous malse, where it is covered by the orbicularis palpebrarum, which it perforates to reach the skin of the cheek and lower lid, communicating with branches of the portio dura. The lachrymal nerve often receives a branch of communication from the fourth, and a branch is also described as arising from it to com- municate with the superior maxillary in the spheno- maxillary fissure, but the latter we have not seen in any subject. Frontal Nerve The largest division of the oph- thalmic •, enters the orbit through the sphenoidal fissure, lying inferior and external to the fourth, and above the suptTrior division of the third, from which it is separated by the levator palpebrse, superior rectus, and one head of the external rectus; passing forwards and outwards, lying on the levator palpebr£e, which it grooves, and be- neath the periosteum, and about one inch behind the margin of the orbit, it becomes flattened, and divides into two branches,—an internal or supratrochleator, and an external or proper frontal; the former runs forwards and inwards, passes above the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle, sends down a branch to communicate with the infratrochleator, and piercing the superior palpebral ligament, escapes beneath the lower margm of the corrugator supercilii, perforates the internal fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum, and divides into two sets of branches:—superior, which, passing upwards, supply the integuments of the centre of the forehead, orbicularis,and occipito-frontalismuscles; andmferior, which are divided into palpebral and nasal filaments; the former supplying the upper lid, and communicating with the lachrymal, while the latter, passing downwards

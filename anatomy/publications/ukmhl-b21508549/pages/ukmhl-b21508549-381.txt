MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 371 figure, placed obliquely, one cornu directed upwards and outwards, the second downwards and inwards; tlie formation of the superior cornu is sufficiently intelli- gible from the previous remarks on the separation of the fibres; the inferior cornu is formed by the non-de- cussating insertion of the pubic fibres of the tendon overlapping and crossing at an acute angle the decus- sating insertion of Poupart's ligament into the symphi- sis. This oval ring is divided into a pubic portion, on which the spermatic cord lies, and a suprapubic, through which it passes in its transit from the inguinal canal to the scrotum; it presents an internal and external pillar, but it is preferable to call them bands or segments; the internal is also superior and anterior; it consists of the flat, thin, non-decussating band of the tendon; the exter- nal is also posterior and inferior; but we cannot agree with Dr. Harrison in stating that this is thick and round (see " Dublin Dissector"), as it really consists of two very dissimilar parts, being, in the external two-thirds, thin and sharp, formed in this situation by the oblique apo- neurosis passing downwards beneath the cord, to be- come attached to the termination of the iliac portion of the fascia lata, where that is reflected downwards on the surface of the pubic portion, constituting Colles's fascia; the internal third is thick, round, and concave, and is formed by Poupart's ligament passing to its pu- bic attachment; the base is formed by the crest of the pubis, covered by the non-decussating fibres of Poupart's ligament, but it is on the angle of the external pillar that the cord lies, where the thick and thin divisions unite. The ring measures in the male, from base to apex, one inch, sometimes an inch and a quarter; in the female its dimensions are much less; in the former, the cord and cremasteric covering pass through it, and in the latter, the round ligament of the uterus; in both the branch of the spermaticus superficialis escapes through the superior angle, and the genital branch of the genito- crural through the lower, beneath the cord; the ileo-hy- pogastric branch pierces the tendon higher up, or, in some rare instances, also passes through the ring. Now let an incision be carried from the cartilage of the ninth rib to the spine of the pubis, and another be

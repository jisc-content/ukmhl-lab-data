710 NERVOUS SYSTEM. lower part of the abdomen; while between the muscles it always anastomoses with the ilio-scrotal. External or Inferior Musculo-cutaneous arises from the second lumbar nerve, sometimes receiving a branch from the third; it perforates the psoas and runs downwards and outwards over the iliacus internus, m- " vested in a tubule of the fascia iliaca. It now crosses under Poupart's ligament below the anterior superior spine of the ilium and beneath the fascia lata of the thigh and divides into two branches,—a posterior or gluteal and an anterior or femoral. The former winds downwards and backwards, passing m its course either over or through or under the tensor vaginae femoris, and separates into filaments for the supply of the inte- guments over the glutseal region; the lateral or femoral branch, after passing downwards for a short distance, divides into two,—an external, running downwards and backwards, is distributed to the skin of this part as far down as the lower third of the thigh in inverted loops, and an internal, which can be traced downwards nearly as low as the patella, and then, bending backwards, be- comes arched and flattened, supplying the integuments on the outer side of the thigh a little above the knee. Genito-crural—Very thin and slender; arises from the second lumbar nerve ; passing obliquely downwards and forwards, it pierces the psoas muscle, and then rests on its anterior and inner part, enveloped m a thm tubule of fascia, and covered by the ureter and spermatic ves- sels About two inches above Poupart's ligament it is generally found lying on the outer side of the external iliac artery, and here divides into two branches,—a geni- tal and crural: the former passes upwards and outwards to gain the internal abdominal ring, through wliich it emer-es, and as it traverses the oblique inguinal canal behind the cord, it distributes several twigs to the trans- versals and internal oblique: escaping at length through the external ring, it continues its course downwards and awSto^uppl^theintegumentsofth^ male and the labia ma ora in the female.

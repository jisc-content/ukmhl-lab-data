THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 292 The larger are,—the thyroid, cricoid, and two ary- tenoid; the smaller consist of two cornicula and two cuneiform. There is also a fibro-cartilage,—the epi- glottis. Thyroid Cartilage.—Situated at the superior part of the tube, is shield-shaped, but the resemblance to a saddle is much less remote; it is divided into two alse or wings, an angle or body, and four cornua; each ala is somewhat quadrilateral; on the external surface are seen two tubercles, sometimes united by an obhque ridge, the superior situated in front of the base of the upper cornu; the inferior, smaller, one-third from the posterior edge; to the lower margin of the intervening ridge the sterno-thyroid is attached; the thyro-hyoid arises from the superior margin, while the inferior con- strictor takes its origin from both tubercles, and also from a ligamentous arch between them; superiorly and posteriorly two foramina are often seen for the trans- mission of the superior laryngeal nerve and artery, but this is by no means constant. Anteriorly, the alse unite to form the angle or body; more prominent above than below; larger in the male and adult than in the female or child, its greatest development being coincident with the increase of gravity in the voice; it is covered by the skin, fascia, a bursa to facilitate the movements of as- cent and descent, and occasionally by an ascending slip of the thyroid body; the posterior edge is thick and round, covered by mucous membrane, beneath which are the vertical fibres of the stylo-pharyngeus. The superior margin is thin and convex, forming a notch when taken in conjunction with its fellow, that receives the insertion of the stalk of the epiglottis, the thyro- hyoid membrane being also attached in its whole length; the inferior edge is thicker than the preceding, and pre- sents three arches: the largest excavation m the centre forming the superior boundary of the crico-thyroid space, and giving attachment to the crico-thyroid mem- brane; this is bounded on each side by the inferior alar tubercles, and behind these the edge is excavated to form a smaller arch on each side, overhanging the cricoid car- tilage, and receiving the anterior and middle fibres of the crico-thyroid muscle. The posterior edge terminates

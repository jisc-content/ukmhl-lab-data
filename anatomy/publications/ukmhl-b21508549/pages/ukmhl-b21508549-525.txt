HEART. 515 valve, a structure which in the adult subject is merely rudimentary, appearing in the majority of cases reticu- lated and imperfect. It is semilunar in figure, and com- posed of a duplicature of the serous endocardium placed before, above, and to the right side of the caval orifice; it presents for description a concave and convex margin, and a superior and inferior cornu. The concave edge is free, looking upwards, backwards, and to the right side; the convex margin lies below, and is attached to a horizontal groove between the caval orifice and the anterior wall of the auricle; the superior cornu, narrow and prolonged, is connected to the anterior or left lip of the fossa ovalis, being sometimes continued round that depression to the posterior lip; the inferior cornu, wider than the last described, is united to the anterior edge of the inferior cava, with the lining membrane of which vessel it is perfectly continuous. This valve is of use in fcetal life in directing the current from the cava into the left auricle through the foramen ovale; but we will again recur to this subject when speaking . of the foramen Botalli. Inferior and to the left side of the caval opening, the auricle presents a triangular fa- cette, marked strongly with reticulated muscular fibres, and at the deepest part of the depression a small valve (valvula Thebesii) indicates the position of the orifice of the coronary vein, lying at the posterior and inferior part of the auricle. The coronary veins consist of greater and lesser, the former commencing in the anterior inter- ventricular furrow, above the apex of the heart; it first ascends, then turns backwards and towards the left side, between the left auricle and ventricle, to the pos- terior part; here it receives a branch from the posterior interventricular furrow, and becomes expanded into the great coronary venous sinus, and ultimately the con- tinued trunk pierces the posterior wall of the auricle, where it terminates. The valve situated at the orifice is often absent and always imperfect; nor can it be of much utility in preventing regurgitation, because the opening, being situated in a muscular part of the auricle, the contraction of the surrounding fibres must neces- sarily obviate regurgitation during the systole of that cavity. The existence of the sinus is conceived by some

AETEEIA INNOMINATA—CAROTIDS. 783 Arteria Innominata arises from the junction of the ascending, with the transverse portions of the arch of the' aorta, opposite the cartilage of the second rib, passes upwards, forwards, and outwards, and terminates a little above the sterno-clavicular articulation. Relations—Anteriorly, first bone of sternum, origin of sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, deep cervical fascia, remains of thymus gland, and left vena innomi- nata; posteriorly, the trachea; to the right side, right vena innominata, pneumogastric and phrenic nerves, cone of the pleura, and apex of the lung; and to the left, the left carotid, but separated from it by a triangular interval, in which is apparent the trachea, some loose areolar tissue, with the descending thyroid veins. Remarks.—This artery varies in length from one to two inches, and usually rises higher in the neck in the female than the male, owing to the shortness of the tho- rax in a vertical direction. At its point of bifurcation into carotid and subclavian, it is usually slightly dilated, the former vessel always being on the most anterior plane, and slightly overlapping the latter. Common Carotid arises from the arteria innominata on the right side, a little above the sterno-clavicular arti- culation, passes upwards, backwards, and outwards, and terminates at the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, opposite the lower edge of the third cervical vertebra. Relations.—Anteriorly, integuments, platysma, su- perficial fascia, communicating branch of anterior, with external jugular vein, sterno-mastoid, hyoid, thyroid, and omo-hyoid muscles, deep cervical fascia, superficial branch of superior thyroid artery, transverse thyroid veins, and descenders noni; posteriorly, longus colli, and rectus capitis anticus major, inferior thyroid ar- tery, recurrent and sympathetic nerves; externally, in- ternal jugular vein and pneumogastric nerve; and internally, trachea, oesophagus, inferior constrictor of pharynx, termination of recurrent, and inferior thyroid artery, with lobe of thyroid body, which occasionally overlaps it, especially on the left side. Left Carotid arises from the transverse portion of the arch of the aorta, opposite the second dorsal verte- bra, but terminates at the same point as the right; it consequently, in the first part of its course, for about

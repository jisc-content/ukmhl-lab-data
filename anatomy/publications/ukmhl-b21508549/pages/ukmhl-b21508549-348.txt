Action.â€”To extend the fore-arm, to strengthen the capsular ligament inferiorly, and to draw the arm back- wards ; the sudden action of this muscle may fracture the olecranon, but the ascending fibres, together with the superficial expansion, prevent the amount of sepa- ration of the fragments that might be anticipated; be- tween the long head and the subscapularis the capsular ligament is uncovered in a large extent; and it is here the humerus escapes in axillary dislocation; but we have seen this space commonly strengthened by a band unit- ing the teres major, subscapular, and long head of the triceps. DISSECTION OF THE FORE-ARM. The integument on the front of the fore-arm is fine and thin, loosely adherent to the subjacent fascia, gradually diminishing in thickness towards the annular ligament, as is evidenced by the facility of observing the plexiform arrangement of the veins; passing to the palm of the hand, the integument is thin but dense, and firmly adherent to the fascia beneath, but laterally on the thenar emin- ence (ball of the thumb) and hypo-thenar emmence (ball of little finger) it is much finer and more moveable. Transverse depressions are seen in the palmar integu- ment; one generally commences at the interthenar space, passing downwards, forwards, and outwards; a second passes inwards and upwards from the termination of the last; and a third passes from the anterior third of the hypo-thenar eminence outwards, and generally ends at the base of the middle finger; the first corresponds to the axis of flexion of the metacarpo-carpal articulation of the thumb; the second and third to the axis of flexion of the four fingers as opponents of the thumb; following the skin on the palmar aspect of the fingers, it is dense on the phalanges, but sulcated and fine opposite the angle of flexion of each joint; at the extremities of the finger it is fine and highly organized, but the density is here subject to great variety, influenced m all cases by its being liable to friction or otherwise. On the back ot the fore-arm the skin is somewhat stronger than before.

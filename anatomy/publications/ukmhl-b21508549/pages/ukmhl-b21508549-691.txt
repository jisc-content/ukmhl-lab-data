CEREBRAL NERVES. 681 but each filament of origin being invested by a neuri- lemma, and, having reached the opening, they jDerforate the dura mater in front of the jugular vein, from which they are separated by a fibrous septum, and occasionally by a complete plate of bone, the glosso-pharyngeal escaping the most anterior and external, immediately on the inner side of the inferior petrosal sinus, whilst the pneumogastric and spinal accessory emerge through a common aperture behind it. As these nerves leave the cranium a tubule of arachnoid is prolonged on them for some distance, which again enters the cranium to be continuous with the parietal layer of that membrane. In order to follow their further course with advantage the jugular foramen should be opened posteriorly, and each nerve individually examined. Glosso-pharyngeal—The smallest of the three divi- sions of the eighth pair; passes through its distinct canal, m front of the jugular vein and the pneumogastric and spinal accessory nerves, then running outwards be- tween the former and internal carotid, and descending anterior to the latter, and behind the styloid process and stylo-pharyngeus, it turns forwards and inwards coursing along the lower edge of that muscle, around which It curves to reach a triangular space, bounded above by the stylo-glossus, below by the stylo-pharyn- : geus, and in front by the hyo-glossus, which constitutes ; Its base, whilst the floor is formed by the superior cou- • stnctor. In this situation it lies behind the tonsil and im front of the palato-pharyngeus, and here divides'into iits ultimate branches. In the upper part of the iuau- lar fossa it presents a small mass of grey matter, only .involving a few of its fibres; this is named the petrosal .ganglion of Muller, but was really discovered by Eh- :renritter. The jugular ganglion (Andersch) is situated :much lower down, in a depression of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, at the inner and anterior part of 'the jugular foramen, but still in the bone which forms ;the external boundary of that opening; it includes the whole trunk of the glosso-pharyngeal, and is not always ot the same size or colour as we have seen the nerve at • this pomt only exhibiting a slight grey tinge, without the appearance of any ganglion, but in a few cases only. 2 G 3

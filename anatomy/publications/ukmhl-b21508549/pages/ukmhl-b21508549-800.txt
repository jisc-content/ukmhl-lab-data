790 ARTERIES AND VEINS. and above, a variable mass of fat, with branches of portio dura; posteriorly, ramus of jaw, buccinator, levator anguli, and labii superioris alajque nasi, and ultimately nasal process of superior maxillary bone. Its accompanying vein, which is very large, lies in its entire course to its outside, and is void of the tortuosity which distinguishes the artery. Collateral Branches.—Those in the cervical stage are, palatine, tonsillitic, glandular, and submental; those in the facial, masseteric, labial, inferior and superior coronary, nasal and angular, or terminating. Palatine,—This is generally very small, arising usually in common with the tonsillitic, immediately after the origin of the facial; it passes upwards, back- wards, and inwards, between the stylo-glossus and stylo- pharyngeus, and between the external and internal carotid arteries, and reaching the superior constrictor of the pharynx, which it perforates to supply the ve- lum, anastomoses with the proper palatine arteries from the internal maxillary. Tonsillitic.—Variable in size; it arises generally in common with the preceding, and passes upwards and inwards between the stylo-glossus and internal ptery- goid, into the pterygo-pharyngeal space, perforates the superior constrictor, and is distributed to the tonsil, anastomosing with branches from the palatine. Glandular.—Three or four branches, distributed to the submaxillary gland. Submental Always large; it arises from the facial, immediately before the termination of its cervical stage, and passes forwards and inwards, beneath the ramus of the jaw, on the upper margin of the mylo-hyoid muscle, dividing on it into three branches,—a superior, middle, and inferior: the first winding upwards over the ramus of the jaw, to anastomose with the labial; the second dividing on the front of the chin into numerous ramus- culi, which supply that region; and the third piercing the mylo-hyoid muscle, to anastomose with the sublin- gual of the lingual. Masseteric.—These are very irregular as to number and size; they arise from the facial, immediately after it crosses the ramus of the jaw, and, passing outwards,

POSTERIOR SPINAL NERVE. 723 2 I 2 size, being nearly four times larger than its anterior branch. It escapes between the atlas and axis, and throws off communicating twigs to the first and third nerves; passes upwards over the inferior oblique and the triangular space, covered by the complexus, which it afterwards perforates very obliquely, between the last- named muscle and the trapezius, being in company with, but internal to, the occipital artery; piercing now the trapezius, it becomes subcutaneous, and divides into a series of branches of a flattened form, which are dis- tributed exclusively to the scalp and hair follicles of the occipital region. While in the neck it distributes large branches to the inferior oblique, splenius, com- plexus, and trapezius. ' Third Cervical is much smaller than the last; it emerges between the axis and third cervical vertebra, and immediately sends off an anastomotic twig to the second; it now continues its course inwards between the semispmalis colli and complexus; and at the internal border of the last muscle divides into two branches,— a cranial and cervical, both cutaneous; the former per- forates the attachments of tlie complexus and trapezius to the spinous processes, becomes cutaneous, and is dis- tributed to the integuments of the mesial line of the occipital region, while the latter, also piercing the same muscles, is immediately reflected outwards for the sup- ply of the skin of this region. The anastomosis which we have alluded to between the three nerves just de- scribed constitute what has been called the posterior cervical plexus, which lies between the complexus and semispmalis, in company with the posterior jugular vein and cervicalis profunda artery. Its branches°of supply are distributed to the two muscles just mentioned and the splenius. It would be tedious as well as unnecessary to de scribe individually the posterior branches of the five re- maining cervical nerves, as their course and ultimate distribution are almost precisely similar, running at first inwards between the complexus and semispinalis colli to each of which they give muscular branches, as well as to the multifidus spinse, and then perforating the su-

183 ANKLE-JOINT. tubercle; it is divided into two compartments by a thin septum, affording passage to the tendons of the peronseus longus and brevis. Posterior or Internal Annular Ligament.—This is more dense and strong than either of the two preced- ing; it arises from the back part of the internal malleo- lus, and is directed downwards and backwards, to be inserted into the internal and posterior part of the os calcis; it, like the anterior, is divided into three canals by two septa,—the most internal being traversed by the tibialis posticus and flexor digitorum communis, but sepa- rated from each other by a thin process of fibrous tissue; the middle by the posterior tibial vessels and nerve; and the most external by the flexor pollicis proprius; this ligament has united to it superiorly the fascia of the back part of the leg, and inferiorly the internal process of the plantar, and one head of the abductor pollicis. Synovial Membrane—This is common both to the ankle-joint and the inferior tibio-fibular articulation; it forms a loose fold anteriorly and posteriorly, but is tense laterally,—an arrangement that might be inferred from the peculiar motions of the joint. Motions.—These, according to very high, and indeed the best, authorities, are confined simply to flexion and extension; rotation or lateral motion, however limited, being impossible, from the peculiar mechanism of the j oint. ExtCTision.—This movement is remarkable from the manner in which the articular surfaces of the opposing bones become altered in their relations to each other; the trochlea of the astragalus gliding forward beneath the inferior extremity of the tibia, so that the posterior lip of the former rests on the groove of the latter posteriorly; beyond this extension cannot be carried, as the anterior portion of the internal lateral, and the anterior slip of the external lateral ligament, with the extensor tendons, are put violently on the stretch, and present an insur- mountable obstacle to further motion in this direction. Flexion This is the reverse of the other ; the trochlear surface of the astragalus is carried backwards behind the tibia, and projects posteriorly, the anterior lip of the tibia resting on the neck of the astragalus; an excess in this movement is limited by the tension

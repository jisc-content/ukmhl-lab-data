THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 390 the surface, which was internal in the abdomen, is ex- ternal in the scrotum; having arrived at the pubis, the scrotal portion now takes up the contraction, carrying the gland to its ultimate destination; this last subse- quently becomes atrophied almost to perfect oblitera- tion. The cremasteric fibres are pale and weak in the infant and advanced life, but in the young and robust a beautiful reticulated arrangement is visible. In a case of sarcocele which we lately examined, the fibres were collected into fasciculi, somewhat resembling vessels emptied of their contents ; the inclusion of the expanded muscle between the two spoutlike fasciae prevents the separation of the fibres when subject to distention. In addition to investing the cord, it also surrounds the tes- ticle, hence is derived the name tunica communis. The external spermatic branch of the ilio-scrotal nerve lies on its anterior and external side, and divides into fila- ments for the supply of the scrotum and cremaster; small branches of the epigastric artery (cremasteric) form the vascular supply. Tunica Vaginalis.â€”In the adult a distinct serous sac, but in infancy communicating with the general peritoneal cavity. As the testicle lay in the iliac fossa, the peritoneum formed the immediate investment for its anterior surface, but as the organ descends it glides on the surface of the iliac fascia, still carrying with it that portion of the serous layer, which adheres to the tunica albuginea. At Poupart's ligament it rest against the posterior surface of the fascia transversalis, m the site of the future internal abdominal ring; by this movement the arrangement of the peritoneum is much altered; the growth of the abdominal wall m an upward direction draws the peritoneum upwards, and that portion of the membrane carried downwards by the gland, in- stead of corresponding to the iliac fossa, is now the most inferior part of the peritoneal sac, so that it the com- munication be examined between the two serous mem- branes in an infant recently born, there exists a pertect continuity, through a funnel-shaped aperture, ihere is no folding or corrugation of the membrane to pro- duce this change, but simply the development of the abdominal wall, with a coincident growth of the serous

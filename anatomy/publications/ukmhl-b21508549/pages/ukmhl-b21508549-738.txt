NERVOUS SYSTEM. 728 and these uniting into one cord, after receiving a twig from the second cervical nerve, it descends on the right side, close to the trachea, external and posterior to the common carotid, sending filaments to the thyroid gland, pharyngeal plexus, and pnenmogastric nerve; at the lower part of the neck it winds outwards, and crosses between the subclavian vein and artery, and behind the middle cardiac, and here divides into filaments, which •unite with others from the recurrents and inferior cardiac. The nerve of the left side pursues nearly a similar course, but at the lower part of the neck it passes between the subclavian and carotid arteries, and at their origin divides into numerous branches, some of which run along the aorta, to unite with the inferior cardiac, while others pass behind it, to join the cardiac ganglion. Middle Cardiac Nerves.—Usually very large; they arise from the inner side of the middle cervical ganglion by five or six roots, which soon unite to form a single trunk; after comm^micating by two or three filaments with the pnenmogastric, it descends between the sub- clavian vein and artery, anastomoses with the recurrent, then passes downwards on the outside of the arteria innominata, and then between the arch of the aorta and bifurcation of the trachea, where it expands to form the cardiac ganglion. The nerve of the left side is not as large as the preceding at its origin, but it receives a reinforcing branch from the inferior cervical ganglion, as well as two or three twigs from the pneumogastric, and then passes behind the arch of the aorta, and termi- nates in the cardiac ganglion. _ Inferior Cardiac Nerves—These arise from the inferior cervical ganglions by numerous filaments, which afterwards unite, and then pass downwards behind the subclavian artery on the right side, and along the side of the pulmonary artery on the left, ternunatmg in the cardiac plexus on the front of the trachea, and behind the aorta. „ ^- j Cardiac GANGLiON.-This was first mentioned by Wrisberg, who described it as lying between the con- cavity of the arch of the aorta and right pu monary artery; it is formed, according to the same author, by

504 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. to the posterior and right side; these unite by cross or oblique branches, constituting the plexus before alluded to The oesophagus, having entered tlie cavity of the abdomen, should now be examined in that situation which may be accomplished by raising the left lobe and lateral ligament of the liver, as these form its anterior relations! posteriorly it corresponds to the left crus of the diaphragm, left phrenic artery, and occasionally to the semilunar ganglion of the sympathetic. The abdo- minal portion of the tube is from l^alf-an-inch to one inch and a half in length, and becomes dilated as it en- ters the stomach, midway between the sr^enic end and lesser curvature, but a little nearer to the former. When the stomach is distended it forms a very obtuse angle with the lesser ciirvature, and one equally acute with the great end, these angles being less evident when the organ is collapsed. The pneumogastnc nerves still pre- se?ve a similar relation to the tube, and m addition, the ascending branch of the coronaria ventriculi lies on its internal and anterior part. . rr Structure of the (Esophagus.-lt consists of four coats -fibrous, muscular, subfibrous, and mucous. The fibrous covering is well marked after the middle periods of'S: b^t is always present, forming a ^^^^^^^^ ment for the tube in its whole extent. Although senii Sansparent, its strength is very great particularly m the medias inal portion of the tube, where jt .serves to prevSit over-distention, and preserves the relation of the mulcular fibres to each other. The muscular coat con- "f two planes, longitudinal and circular, the former beii ' external, and extending from the rfge on the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage to the stomach, whernhey become continuous with the muscular layer Tf that organ, the latter forming a wel -marked layer, mcewt continuous with the ^^^jf^]^^^^^^^^^ mach where an alteration is manifest m their chaiacter when structurally examined. In ^^^^^J^^.^^^ tnbp the muscular fibres are red in colour, and e^ laenuy JrinPd but in the two inferior thirds they become pale, striped, but in tw -â€ži,;-uuine all the usual cha- the strise disappearing and exhibiting racteristics of involuntary muscles.

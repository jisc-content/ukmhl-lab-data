The facial surface of the bone is very exten- sive, and is, generally speaking, concave. It consists of two fossae,—one anterior, small and quadrilateral,—the incisive or myrtiform; the other large, concave, and likewise square,—the canine. The myrtiform fossa (so called from its shape) is bounded below by the in- cisor teeth, above by the lower part of the nasal notch, in front by the symphysis, and behind by the promi- nence of the canine tooth; it gives origin to the de- pressor labii superioris alaeque nasi. The canine fossa is bounded below by the alveoli of the two anterior molar teeth, above by the edge of the orbit and articu- lation of the malar bone; in front by the elevation of the canine tooth and nasal notch, and behind by the jugal ridge; it affords attachment to the compressor nasi internally, to the levator anguli oris externally, and to the short head of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi superiorly; between these two last muscles is the infra-orbital hole, directed downwards and forwards, through which passes the vessels and nerves of the same name. The jugal ridge which bounds this fossa poste- riorly commences below at the third molar tooth, where it is but slightly elevated, but as it ascends it becomes gradually more prominent till it terminates in a sharp point above and externally; here it changes its course and bifurcates into two laminae,—one sharp and thin, which runs forwards and inwards to the anterior edge of the orbit, where it terminates; the other thick, more elevated and irregular, which strikes backwards and in- wards towards the spheno-maxillary fissure, where it ceases abruptly; between the two is circumscribed a rough depressed triangular surface for the reception of the malar bone. The zygomatic portion of the bone is situated posteriorly, bounded below by the two last molar teeth, above by the edge of the orbital process, externally by the jugal ridge, and internally by its ar- ticulation with the palate. The inner part of this sur-

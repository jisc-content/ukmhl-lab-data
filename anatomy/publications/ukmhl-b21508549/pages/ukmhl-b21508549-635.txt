CEREBRUM. 525 ■whilst the floor is formed from without inwards and backwards—by the tail or narrow extremity of the cor- pus striatum, tania semicircularis, optic thalamus cho- roid plexus, and fornix. ' The Posterior Cornu is bounded superiorly, ex- ternally, and internally, by the medullary subst'anc'e, and mferiorly by the hippocampus minor and the di- gital fossa. The Inferior Cornu is incurvated in its direction passing at first outwards and backwards, then down- wards, forwards, and inwards, towards the internal ex- tremity of the fissure of Sylvius, and is bounded exter- nally by the medullary structure; internally by arach- noid membrane; above by the tail of the corpus stria- tum, tEBUia semicircularis, and posterior part of the optic thalamus; and inferiorly by the hippocampus major and pes hippocampi, teenia hippocampi, fascia dentata and choroid plexus. ' Now divide the corpus callosum about its centre re- flecting one portion backwards and the other forwards which will display the septum lucidum and cavity of the fifth ventricle. •' Septum Lucidum.—A triangular lamina of grey and white medullary structure, forming a vertical partition between the bodies of the lateral ventricles, the base before and below, the apex above and behind, attached superiorly and anteriorly to the corpus callosum, and posteriorly and inferiorly to tlie fornix and anterior commissure, the cavity of the fifth ventricle being situ- ated m its centre, and each lateral wall consisting of four layers,-namely, most externally arachnoid, then a grey, internal to which is a white layer; and lastly, arachnoid again lining the cavity of the fifth ventricle- the latter being bounded above and before by the corpus callosum, below and behind by the fornix and anterior commissure, and laterally by the layers of the septum lucidum. The arachnoid lining this cavity constitutes a closed sac in the adult, but in the fcetus it is con- nected by the canal ofWenzel with the foramen com- mune antenus, and thus with the general arachnoid cavity but this communication disappears early la cases, however, of chronic internal hydrocephalus it fre- 2 E

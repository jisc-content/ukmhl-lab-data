652 NERVOUS STSTEM. Structure, between the foramina of emergence of any two nerves, which they thus serve to separate, while at the same time they tend to keep the cord itself accu- t rately fixed in its position. Various opinions have been advanced as to the nature of this ligament, some assert- ing that it is a separate structure; others, that it is a process of the dura mater; others, of the arachnoid; and others again, of the piamater: the last, however, appears to be the correct view of it. Having completed the examination of the investing tissues, the cord itself must next be exposed; and this may be done by cautiously removing the pia mater, a difficult operation, as it adheres to it very closely, par- ticularly in the regions of the origins of the nerves. The spinal marrow in the human subject averages a length of from fifteen to eighteen inches, commencing opposite the ring of the first cervical vertebra, and ter- minating at the inferior margin of the second lumbar: neither of these points are, however, invariably the same, as, besides individual discrepancies, flexion and extension of the head may influence the position of the one and similar movements of the vertebral column may alter that of the other. In intra-uterine life it reaches downwards as far as the coccyx, but m the mfant at birth only as far as the fourth lumbar vertebra. In shape it is cylindrical, but flattened both on its anterior and posterior aspects, presenting two well-marked dic- tations (we exclude at present that of the medulla oblon-^ata),—the superior or cervico-brachial bulb, oval in fit^ure, extending from the third cervical to the third dorsal vertebra; and an inferior or dorso-lumbar pyn- form, with the base superiorly at the eleventh dorsal, and the apex inferiorly at the second lumbar where it terminates in the filum terminale. These enlargements are obviously attributable to those large nervous masser which are thrown off at those points, viz.: the bracliia above, and the lumbar and sacral below; but m thedorsa ret^ion a similar increase in size and structure is not re- quired, as, although respiration is a most "«Portan. function, still the muscles which are subservient o il do not d;pend for their supply on the nerves only whid. arise in the immediate vicinity of the thoracic cavity

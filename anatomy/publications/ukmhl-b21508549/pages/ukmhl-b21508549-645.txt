CEREBRUM. 635 bodies, two anterior and superior,—the nates; and two lying posterior and inferior to the last,—the testes: the former being oval and grey, their long measurement di- rected obliquely outwards and forwards; the latter much smaller and usually white; the optic nerves are con- nected to the nates and not unfrequently also to the testes. Aqueduct of Sylvius, or, Iter a Tertio ad Quartum Ventriculum If a probe is introduced beneath the posterior commissure and tubercula quadrigemina, and above the pons varolii, it will enter the fourth ventricle at its upper and anterior part through a canal directed obliquely downwards and backwards, through which the arachnoid membrane passes to line the cavity of the fourth ventricle. Now slit the medullary layer forming the roof of the fourth ventricle, having previously drawn backwards the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum, which overhangs it. Fourth Ventricle, or, Ventricle of the Cerebel- lum—This cavity is bounded above by the valve of Vieussens and the superior vermiform process of the cerebellum; inferiorly by the posterior surfacfe of the medulla oblongata, calamus scriptorius, and the arach- noid membrane stretched from the medulla to the cere- bellum ; anteriorly by the pons varolii; posteriorly by the cerebellum; and laterally by the processus a cerebello ad testes. "We will now proceed to examine each wall in detail. Valve of Vieussens.—A triangular lamina of grey neurine, thin and semitransparent, called by Haller the velum interjectum; it is triangular in figure, the base situated below and behind, the apex above and before, the margins attached to the superior cerebellar peduncles (processus a cerebello ad testes), the apex to the testes, and the inferior part or base lost in the middle lobe of the cerebellum; the superior surface, concave, is covered by the superior vermiform process, where it is attached to the linguetta, and more anteriorly a few grey trans- verse fibres are seen, from v/hich arise the fourth pair of nerves; whilst, running from before backwards, a grey elevated line may sometimes be observed, which is called

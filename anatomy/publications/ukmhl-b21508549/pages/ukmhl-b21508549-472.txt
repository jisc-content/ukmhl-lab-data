462 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. separated by a cellular interval, througli which a direct continuity of areolar tissue is established from tbe pelvis to the popliteal region. The student should refer to the popliteal artery and sacral plexus for the further anatomy of this region. DEEP ABDOMINAL MUSCLES. These consist of five pair, considering the diaphragm to be composed of symmetrical halves, viz.: diaphragm psoas magnus &nd parvus, quadratus lumborum, and iliacus internus. . , DiAPHRAGM._In order to expose this muscular sep- tum, the liver, kidneys, spleen, stomach, and duodenum should be removed; the peritoneum should then be cautiously detached from the fleshy portion, but great difficulty will occur in the attempt to remove it tiom the central tendon; a different subject, in which ^le abdomen has not been opened, will give the most faith- ful view of the natural condition of the thoracic surface, and in order to expose it, the lungs and pericardium toc^ether with the pleural membrane, should be removed In^the adult the Pinion of the fibrous Pej^^^j^'^^-^^ ^ intimate that it is impossible to separate them, but n the f^tus such a separation can be accomplished^^^^^^^^ facility. The diaphragm forms an oblique septum be tw en the thoracic and abdominal cavities, convex to- wards the former, and concave in the latter aspect; it is Med into a superior flat portion, true diaphragm, and an nferior, the crura or false; the superior being Slptical in shape, longer in the transverse diamete , fleshy at the circumference, tendinous m the centre it ar£ by a broad, short, flat band from the posterior Sace Ind base of the ensiform canilage^^^^^^^^^^ fleshy slips from the internal surface of the cax^tU^^^^^^^ last true and all the false ribs, likewise from their tny t^^ Zlly from the ligamentum ^r^^^^^^^^ ternum and internum; the anterior 6^;^ P^^^ ^a^^ wards, the lateral upwards and inwards, t^;^ P°^^^^^^^^ Zos; vertically ^^^^^ ^V^^^ central or cordiform tendon.

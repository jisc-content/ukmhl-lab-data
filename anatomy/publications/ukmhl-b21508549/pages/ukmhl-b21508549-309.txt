299 Thtro-ARYTENOID.—Narrow behind, broad and fleshy before; arises from the posterior surface of the angle of the thyroid; it passes backwards and outwards, and is inserted into the external and anterior side of the ary- tenoid cartilage. Relations.—Externally, the ala of the thyroid carti- lage ; internally, the superior vocal chord; below, a tri- angular space, which separates it from the crico-aryte- noideus lateralis, and above, Hilton's muscle; sometimes this muscle is divided into three or four bands, with cellular intervals between them, but we have never seen the muscle so low as to be in contact with the inferior vocal chord, nor the insertion prolonged into the manu- brium, as stated by some. Action.—To draw downwards and forwards the ary- tenoid cartilages, also to approximate them, diminish- ing the rima by their contraction ; they may force the superior vocal chord into the cavity, rendering it more prominent, but certainly can exert little in- fluence in modifying vibration. Explicable by their anatomical position with reference to the vocal chords, we consider them functionally as a part of the lateral crico-arytenoid, assisting in drawing forwards the outer edge of the arytenoid cartilages, and by this means ap- proximating the manubria and vocal chords, and in that manner contracting the lateral diameter of the rima. Crico-arytenoideus Lateralis.—Triangular, base above and behind, apex below and before; much thicker than the last-described muscle; it arises from the upper and outer edge of the side of the cricoid cartilage, passes upwards and backwards, and is inserted into .the external edge of the base of the arytenoid cartilage. Relations.—Externally it is covered by the crico- thyroid muscle and the thyroid cartilage; internally it is in contact with the true vocal chord and mucous membrane; its lo\ver edge corresponds to the superior margin of the cricoid cartilage, and above to a triangular interval, separating it from the thyro-arytenoid. Action To draw downwards and forwards the ary- tenoid cartilage; to rotate the base so as to turn the manubrium inwards; also to approximate the superior to the inferior vocal chord.

615 DURA MATER. The inferior petrosal is larger, but only about half the length of the last; commencing at the cavernous, often in common with the superior petrosal, it passes down- wards and backwards, corresponding to the junction of the petrous with the cuneiform process of the occipital bone, and then piercing the dura mater, which closes the foramen lacerum posterius, terminates in the internal jugular vein on the outer side of the eighth pair of nerves, receiving the transverse occipital sinus with a small diploic vein that passes through the anterior lace- rated openmg. It is remarkable that the dura mater does not intervene between this sinus and the cartilage uniting the occipital and temporal bones. Circular Sinus lies in the sella turcica, and consists ot an anterior and posterior portion, the former lyina before and above, the latter below and behind the pitui- tary body, and communicating on either side with the cavernous sinus. A third sinus (transverse sphenoidal) IS sometimes present, crossing the body of the sphenoid bone, and also communicating with the cavernous on each side; we have, however, frequently observed its ab- sence. Ihese sinuses receive veins from the bone and the pituitary body, but not from the brain. Transverse Occipital Smus.—Small,and sometimes absent; lies on a level with the anterior lacerated open- ing, and, crossing the basilar process of the occipital bone, It communicates between the two inferior petro- sal Just at this point a number of sinuses unite in confluence, namely, cavernous, petrosal, and transverse occipital,-th.s dilatation being called the anterior tor- cular Herophili. Lateral SiNusEs—These are symmetrical, consisting of righ and left, the former being the larger, and th! atter the longer ot the two. Each sinus commences from the lateral angle of the torcular Herophili, and passes at first horizontally outwards, grooving the occipital bone and the posterior inferior angle of the parietal, then curves downwards in the deep sulcus of the mastoid portion of the temporal; lastly, turns forwards and in- wards, again indenting the occipital behind and external to the basilar process, and, piercing the dura mater stretched across the foramen lacerum posterius in basi

THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 186 be sufficient to show, that as far as the contiguous sur- faces of the bones are concerned, displacement would appear to be the obvious consequence of force applied to them from above, the shallow cup of the scaphoid being quite insufficient to contain the large head of the astragalus, which, in its natural condition, protrudes from beneath it into the hollow of the foot; but nature has been careful to guard against such an accident by placing beneath it the calcaneo-scaphoid ligament, which both deepens the cavity, and at the same time supports the head of the bone, while, in addition to this, the tendon of the tibialis posticus, with its sesamoid bone developed in it, and rendered tense at the moment its assistance is more particularly required, winds beneath it to its insertion, and forms an active ligament to sus- tain it, as the weight transmitted from above would operate to depress it from its natural position. CALCANEO-CUBOID ARTICULATION. In this joint the anterior extremity of the os calcis articulates with the posterior of the cuboid; as the sur- faces are alternately concave and convex, the union takes place by a process termed mutual reception; its ligaments are,—a superior, an inferior, and internal. _ SuPEEiOR Calcaneo-cuboid Ligament.— This lies under the extensor digitorum brevis, which must be re- moved in order to see it. The fibres which compose it are rather weak, and stretch from fhe upper and ante- rior part of the os calcis to the posterior margin of the cuboid bone. Inferior Calcaneo-cuboid Ligament.—This pro- perly consists of two distinct portions,—a superficial, originally known as the ligamentum longum plantas, and a deep, the ligamentum breve. The first is a dense, shining, pearly band, extending from the whole of the under surface of the os calcis as far back as its tubercles, horizontally forwards to the inferior part of the cuboid, to be inserted into the posterior lip of the peroneal groove, and the rough space immediately behind it. In its character it is exceedingly strong. The deep por- tion is brought into view by cautiously removing the preceding, and a small quantity of adipose tissue which

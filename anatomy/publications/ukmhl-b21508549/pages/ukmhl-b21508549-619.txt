DURA MATER. 609 2 D 3 sinus from before backwards, then reflect it downwards, drawing the cerebral hemisphere a little to one side' and expose the— ' Falx Cerebri—A sickle-shaped fold of dura mater, occupying the great longitudinal fissure between the hemispheres, which it supports in the varied movements of the head, being of a curved triangular outline, present- ing for examination an apex, base, convex and concave margins, and two surfaces. The apex is attached anteriorly to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone, which it seems to embrace, the base posteriorly being connected with the upper surface of the tentorium, in this situation bemg broad and bifid, slinging the tentorium in the centre, where it incloses the straight sinus. The con- vex margin is connected to the mesian line on the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones, containing the su- perior longitudinal sinus; the concave edge is free, cor- responding to the upper surface of the corpus callo'sum, from which it is separated by the arachnoid membrane uniting the two hemispheres; it contains the follow- ing Inferior Longitudinal Sinus or Vein lies in the concave edge of the falx, occupying only, however, its two posterior thirds; it commences by a descending branch, which connects it with the superior longitudinal, then passes backwards in the concavity, dividing into two posteriorly,—one which opens into the commence- ment of the straight sinus; the other curves backwards and terminates in the same sinus about the centre of its course. This is a proper vein, possessing the two coats peculiar to that system of vessels, being enveloped, how- ever, by dura mater, and it receives venous branches irom the falx, but none from the brain. The student may defer the further examination of the sinuses until the brain is removed, which should now be proceeded with in the following manner-—Cut around the opposite side of the dura mater, which has been as yet untouched, then gently separate the hemi- spheres anteriorly, dividing the attachment of the falx cerebri to the ethmoid bone; throw this backwards and allow the head to droop, placing the left hand beneath the hemispheres; the anterior lobes, now receding from

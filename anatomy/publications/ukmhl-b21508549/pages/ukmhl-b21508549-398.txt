388 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. junction is not completed, a median fissure separating the bag permanently into two portions, simulating the labia of the female, each fold containing its respective testicle; such has been the condition of many reputed hermaphrodites. The general relations of the scrotum are,—on each side, the thighs; below and behind, the perineum; and above and before, the penis, from which it is suspended. Dartos,—A thin layer of a yellowish white colour, with numerous reddish fibres interlacing through its structure; its figure represents a trapezium or diamond, attached laterally to the fascia covering the rami of the ischium and pubis, anteriorly to the corpus spongiosum urethrse, and posteriorly to the central tendinous point of the perineum; posteriorly and laterally it sometimes extends backwards, covering the ischio-rectal space, and passing upwards in the middle line to assist in the formation of the septum scroti, where it is attached to the urethra, and then surrounds the penis; this tissue is lax, and in some cases strongly marked; the fibrous element most apparent in other instances presenting all the characters of ordinary areolar tissue with a la- minar arrangement. yS^rMCiMm—Non-striated muscular fibre (Sharpey), nucleated elastic tisse (Hassal) ; the older anatomists conceived it to be an expansion from the superficial sphincter ani; by its contraction, corrugation of the scro- tum and a rolling motion of the testicles are produced. The contraction of the dartos is seen when cold is ap- plied to the scrotum, and those circumstances which produce muscular asthenia have a similar influence on this tissue. As an instance, in advanced typhus the scrotum is lax and pendulous, but as the muscular tone returns it contracts to its ordinary shape and size. The areolar layer consists of the superficial abdominal fascia, carried down on the cord; in the scrotum it becomes lax and reticular, totally devoid of the fatty cha- racter so evident on the abdomen; beneath the raphe it is somewhat dense, and adherent to the dartos and skin. This tissue is exceedingly disposed to become infiltrated with serum, as evidenced in the cases of erysipelas and testitis. In general anasarca it is also enormously dis-

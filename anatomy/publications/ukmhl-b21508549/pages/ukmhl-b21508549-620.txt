610 NERVOUS SYSTEM. \ the orbitar plates of tlie frontal bone, usually carry with them the dura mater, as it adheres very loosely in this region; let this now be replaced, and proceed cau- tiously with the division of the nerves and vessels, cut- ting them close to their foramina of exit on one side, and near their origin on the opposite. The order of parts, as seen from before backwards, is:—Olfactory nerves, of which one should be allowed to remain on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid; the optic nerves, accompanied by the ophthalmic artery, next appear, and should be di- vided ; posterior to these the pituitary body, lying in the sella turcica, which may be allowed to remain, merely dividing the infundibulum; next in order is the internal carotid artery, with the third nerve lying posterior and external to it, this latter leading the knife to the con- cave edge of the tentorium, which should be divided from before backwards on each side; now allowing the brain to droop backwards, the fifth pair of nerves be- comes visible, running towards the superior margin of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, whilst infe- rior and posterior to them the seventh pair are seen coursing towards the meatus auditorius internus; still more inferior and posterior, the eighth pair, consisting of three portions, namely,—pneumogastric, glosso-pharyn- o-eal, and spinal accessory, make for the foramen lacerum post'erius in basis cranii; and, lastly, the ninth or lin- o-ual, passing almost horizontally outwards and for- wards to the anterior condyloid foramen. These must be cut across in succession, then the knife may be in- troduced into the canal through the foramen magnum, dividing as low as possible the spinal marrow, when the brain may be removed and placed in a solution of alum, or naphtha, which answers equally well, but the former is usually preferred as being quite sufficient for ordi- nary purposes. Resume now the examination of the sinuses. , , Straight Sinus lies between the base oi the lalx and the tentorium. It is of a triangular shape ante- riorly, but rhomboid posteriorly, its direction bemg ob- liquely downwards and backAvards; anteriorly it receives the inferior longitudinal sinus with the venjE magna? Galcni, whilst posteriorly it communicates with the tor-

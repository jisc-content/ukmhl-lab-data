597 FBMAIiE ORGANS OF GENERATION. tortuous interlacement (corpus pampiniforme), the right terminating in the vena cava inferior, the left in the corresponding renal vein. The Uterus presents some peculiarities as an organ, exclusive of its special function: amongst these are its quiescence until the period of parturition arrives, also its rapid enlargement from two or three ounces to the enormous weight of four pounds and a half, so that during the distention of the organ it undergoes an absolute in- crease in thickness of its walls, this being in some mea- sure attributable to the enlargement of the vessels, the arteries becoming large and tortuous, and the veins dilated, resembling siniises, which adhere to the proper tissue of the organ; but there likewise occurs an hyper- trophy oftheuterinemusculariibres, which is proved by the circumstance that the organ does not contract to its exact original magnitude until some time after partu- rition is accomplished. The functional action of the several organs described may thus be briefly stated:— The Spermatozoa, introduced into the vagina, enter the uterus in virtue of their automatic movements, pass- ing through that cavity and the Fallopian tubes, iirged in that direction by the ciliary appendages of the epithe- lial investments, and they reach the ovary, where their existence was demonstrated by the Abb§ Spallanzani. The vascularity of the ovary increases, an elevation ap- pearing on its surface, and the Fallopian tube firmly grasping its capsule, the ovum escapes by a slit or rent in the peritoneal investment into the tube; this escape is caused by the thickening of the granulary mem- brane, with the coincident increase in the granulary fluid, accompanied with absorption of the capsule, and as- sisted by the compression of the fimbriated extremity of the Fallopian tube. In the latter the ovum receives an albuminous covering (chorion), and then slowly pur- sues its course towards the uterus, urged in that direc- tion by the ciliary wave and the vermicular action of the tube, but whilst these changes are taking place in tlie female ovarian appendages, the uterus also partici- pates in the functional activity, the gjands at the cervix throwing out an albuminous matter which seals the outlet of the uterus (operculum), the lining membrane

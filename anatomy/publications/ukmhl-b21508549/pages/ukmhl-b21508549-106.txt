THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 96 face is slightly concave; it forms part of the anterior fossa of the cranium; the inferior convex constituting the su- perior wall of the foramen lacerum orbitale; the poste- rior edge is rounded and smooth, and has connected to it the sphenoidal fold of dura mater; the anterior rough and bevilled off so as to rest on the frontal. The greater wing is of an irregular wedge shape, and accordingly presents three surfaces: a superior or cere- bral, an external or temporo-zygomatic, and an internal or orbital; each circumscribed by corresponding margins of articulation. The superior or cerebral surface is in its outline irregularly rhomboidal and deeply concave for the reception of the middle lobe of the brain; in its posterior external angle it presents a small hole,â€”the spinous, for the passage of the middle meningeal artery; more anteriorly and internally a foramen, oval in shape, large for the transmission of the inferior maxillary nerve, hard root of the fifth, and occasionally the ante- rior meningeal artery and small petrosal nerve; more anteriorly and internally still is the hole for the passage of the superior maxillary nerve, the rotundum; it is much smaller and rounder, and is directed forwards and slightly outwards to open into the pterygo-maxillary fossa. The greater wing has four margins: a posterior, external, anterior, and internal. Of these the first is the shortest, flattest, and broadest, elevated into a thin crest above, forming a posterior boundary for the foramen ovale, and lying in contact with the outer side of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; the external margin is the longest, and concave; thick, rough, and serrated posteriorly, where it articulates, behind the edge of the glenoid cavity, and, in front of this, with the squamous plate; more anteriorly it is bevilled off where it is overlapped by the parietal bone. The anterior edge unites with that already described at a very acute angle, cut off obliquely externally, while it is broad and extremely rough internally for articula- tion with the frontal; its inner margin for its two an- terior thirds is free, thin, and irregular, where it forms the inferior boundary of the lacerated hole; its poste- rior third becomes blended with the lower part of the side of the body of the bone.

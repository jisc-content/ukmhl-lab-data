BLADDER. 421 last; some are attached to the superior edge of the prostate, and when that gland is deficient above the urethra, passing along its surface as far as the trian- gular ligament; others sink deep, a few being inserted directly into the cervix, but the greater number re- turning on themselves, uniting with the deeper layer, or bending round the cervix laterally, to be inserted into the lateral edges of the cervical fibrous floor; su- perficial lateral are attached to the capsule of the prostate, and between it and the structure of the gland, the deep passing, some into the fibro-glandular tissue, while others are inserted into the cervix. The posterior su- perficial consist of two bands, that enter the notch in the posterior edge of the prostate, become flattened above the seminal vesicles, and can be traced to the verumontanum, or even to the membranous portion of the urethra; the deep form a distinct plane between thevesiculte seminales, bordered by Bell's muscles, which are the thickest longitudinal fibres of the organ; these terminate in the fibrous floor of the neck. Circular Fibres.—These are principally found in the lower third of the organ, forming a series of rings around it, some of which are parallel, while others in- terlace very obliquely. At the base of the trigone they form a dense band between the orifices of the ureters, to the inner lips of which they are attached, for the purpose of dilating those tubes, according to Bell, and thus aflfording a more ready passage for the urine; above, towards the upper fundus, they can be demonstrated with great difiiculty, while below they become conti- nuous with the annular fibres of the neck. Eeticular Fibres.—These are best observed by dis- secting off the mucous membrane from within; in per- fectly healthy organs they are not very evident, but in the condition known as sacculated bladder, they are most distinct, their separation allowing the mucous membrane to become protruded in the intervals. Submucous Tunic, or Internal Cellular.—This is weak above, but exceedingly strong below; it forms the bed in which the arteries and nerves are distributed hence designated by Bichat as the nervous coat; the in- ternal and external cellular tunics tend to preserve the

BRANCHES OF CAROTID. 795 Hence it has been divided into three stages, the first extending from its origin to the inner margin of the in- ternal lateral ligament, the second while it lies in the pterygoid space, and the third while it occupies the pte- rygo-maxillary fossa. Relations—First Stage—Externally, ramus of jaw and edge of masseter muscle; internally, styloid pro- cess of temporal bone, internal lateral ligament, and in- ternal pterygoid muscle; superiorly, temporo-maxil- ary articulation; and inferiorly, convergence of internal lateral ligament, with vertical ramus of jaw. Second Stage.—Externally, ramus of jaw and temporal muscle; internally, dental and gustatory nerves- supe- riorly, external pterygoid; inferiorly, internal-ptery- goid; and anteriorly, buccinator muscle. Third Stage.—It lies in the pterygo-maxillary fossa, the boundaries of which have been already described with the base of the cranium, and while in this space it is in company with Meckel's ganglion close to the nasal plate of the palate bone, enveloped in a quantity of fat Collateral Branches.—These in the first sta-e are, tympamc, middle meningeal, and inferior dental - in the second, temporal, masseteric, pterygoid, buccal, and superior dental; and in the third, spheno-palatine, pos- terior palatine, Vidian, and infra-orbital. Tympanic—These are a series of minute twigs which enter the tympanum by the Glasserian fissure for the supply of Its mucous membrane. Middle Meningeal arises from the upper part of the artery as it lies internal to the neck of the jaw; -it passes upwards and inwards between the insertion of the exter- nal pterygoid and temporo-maxillary articulation on the outside; the Eustachian tube and levator palati on the inside; the inferior maxillary nerve in front, and theori- 1 gin ofthe internal lateral ligament behind, to all of which at distributes branches; it then runs between the two .roots of origin ofthe temporo-auricular nerve, and enters the cavity of the cranium through the spinous hole, a llittle above which it divides into two sets of branches L :an anterior and posterior: the former passes upwards ..and forwards, groovmg in succession the sphenoid and [parietal, a complete canal sometimes existing iu the 2 M 2 fa u tne

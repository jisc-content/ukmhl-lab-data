219 MUSCLES OF THE HEAD. cuticle is thick and laminated, adhering intimately to the cutis, in consequence of the number of prolonga- tions sent into the hair-follicles, which accounts for the difficulty experienced in producing vesications on the scalp. The cutis is dense, and the fibrous arrangement of this structure can be well observed in the section. The hair-bulbs variegate the surface, and tend to in- crease the density of the tissue. The deep aspect is rough, and attached to the subjacent muscle and ten- don by dense areolar tissue, which constrains the inte- gument to follow the fnuscle during its contractions. OcciPiTO-FRONTALis covers the anterior, middle, and posterior regions of the cranium,â€”thin and weak in some subjects, thick and well marked in others. It consists of two fleshy portions behind (occipital), and the same in front (frontal), with an intervening ten- dinous expansion (epicranial aponeurosis), and arises by short tendinous fibres from the two external thirds of the superior curved line on the occipital bone, also from the outer and back part of the mastoid process; the fleshy masses ascend on the occipital bone, converg- ing to be inserted into the posterior edge of the apo- neurosis ; the anterior fleshy portion is also double, but not so strong as the former; it arises from the anterior edge of the aponeurosis by a lunated border, passes for- wards over the frontal bone, and is inserted into the eyebrow, mixing with the fibres of the orbicularis pal- pebrarum, and internal to this, by a few fibres, into the internal angular process of the os frontis and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi; still more internally, into the aponeurosis of the compressores nasi, by two flat bands which descend on the dorsum of the nose, named pyramidales nasi. Epicranial Aponeurosis is a thin sheet of dense fi- brous tissue, wider behind than before, but narrower in the centre than at either extremity. Laterally, it is attached to the temporal ridges, where it sends a thin process over that fascia; anteriorly and posteriorly, the frontal and occipital fleshy bellies are respectively at- tached to it, while it sends down a process between the latter to be attached to the occipital protuberance; this occupies the space between their inner edges.

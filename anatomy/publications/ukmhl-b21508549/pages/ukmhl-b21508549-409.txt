399 PERINEUM. the anus, communicating with the anterior external hemorrhoidal, while the communicating anastomoses with the opposite artery. The long perineal is also a branch of the internal pudic; it pierces the base of the triangular ligament, winds round the transversus pe- nnei, external to the former artery, runs upwards, for- wards, and inwards on the outer side of the accelerator urinaj, and arriving at the scrotum it divides into an external and internal branch; the former ramifies on the inferior and external surface of the scrotum com- municating with the inferior external pudic; the latter runs in the septum, and is called the arteria septi scroti, which should be avoided in castration. The superficial nerves consist of the long perineal in- ternal and external, which pursue a course similar to the artery of that name, arising from the pudic, some- times separately, and occasionally together; also, the long pudendal, a branch of the lesser sciatic, which winds round the ascending ramus of the ischium, about half- an-inch above the tuber, runs upwards, forwards, and inwards, on the fascia of the perineum and scrotum and terminating on the penis. ' Muscles of the True PERiNEUM—These are three pair,_namely, transversus perinei, erector penis, and accelerator urina. Transversus PERiNEi.—TrianguIar and fleshy lies at the posterior edge of the space; it arises by a flat tendon from the internal side of the tuber ischii above the erector penis; it soon becomes fleshy, and passes obliquely forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the central tendinous point of the perineum, in front of the verge of the anus, and behind the urethra i?eta..-This muscle receives frequently a slip from the superficial sphincter, and not uncommonly it passes over the central point to meet its fellow, forming a distinct muscu ar plam, arching in front of the anus^ From the point oi insertion, a fleshy slip passes forwards and upwards on the side of the accelerator urin^, and 18 so often present that it would almost seem the normal arrangement; this latter may have a distinct origin irom the ascending ramus of the ischium, when it is named transversalis alter, the long perineal artery sepa-

192 THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. I UNION OF THE DIGITAL EXTREMITIES. These are not in contact with each other, but still are united by a transverse ligament of tolerable strength, though sufficiently loose to admit of free motion, which is further facilitated by a synovial membrane interposed between each. UNION OF THE METATARSAL BONES WITH THE PHA- LANGES. These constitute an imperfect angular ginglymus, the head of each metatarsal bone being received into the cup of the corresponding phalanx. They are con- nected by an external and internal lateral, and a supe- rior and inferior, ligament. The External and Internal Lateral are strong and thick They arise from a tubercle situated a little behind the head of the metatarsal bone, and passing forwards and downwards, becoming broader m their course, are inserted into the sides of the adjacent pha- ^^Tferior Ligament is of great strength particularly opposite the articulation. It is attached m front to the inferior lip of the first phalanx, from which it stretches backwards to be implanted into the under part of the neck of the metatarsal bone. It of use in deepening the articulation, and is supported by the flexor tendons. A strong expansion unites it to the lateral ligaments. ■ j- ^- 4. Superior LioAMENT.-This is always very indistinct, and consists of only a few ligamentous fibres extending between the adjacent bones. It is, however, strength- ened and covered by a strong expansion from the exten- '° Syno^v^aL Membrane, distinct for each joint MoTioN.-Flexion and extension in a marked degree, but abduction and adduction limited. ARTICULATION OF THE PHALANGES WITH EACH OTHER. These are complete angular ginglymi, possessing only

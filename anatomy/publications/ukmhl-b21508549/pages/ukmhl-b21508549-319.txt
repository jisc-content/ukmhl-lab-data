MUSCLES OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY. 309 constitute the origin of this muscle, are also visible, and likewise superficial ramusculi of the thoracic arteries. Let it now be raised, and the great pectoral is seen. Pectoralis Major.—Triangular; base at the ster- num, apex at the humerus; arises by short tendinous fibres from the sternal half of the anterior edge of the clavicle, which is sometimes grooved; from the carti- lages of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and also from the cartilage and bone of the sixth, these origins being fleshy on the superficial, but tendinous on the deep surface, from the anterior and outer edge of the ster- num, by an aponeurosis that covers the anterior surface of that bone, the fibres of opposite sides decussating ob- liquely ; from these origins the fibres pass in diff"erent directions, the clavicular downwards, backwards, and outwards; the costal obliquely upwards, backwards, and outwards; and the middle, or sternal, outwards and backwards; all converging to be inserted into the ante- rior and outer lip of the bicipital groove; the clavicu- lar passing to the most inferior and anterior part of the tendon; the costal and sternal portions being twisted upwards and backwards behind the clavicular, thus ly- ing superior and posterior to the latter; the tendon like- wise participates in this twisted arrangement. We have once seen a long flat muscular band arising from the ex- ternal insertion of the rectus, and passing upwards on the serratus magnus; then winding beneath the costal fibres of the great pectoral, to be attached to the supe- rior and posterior edge of the tendon of that muscle. Relations.— The upper and outer edge corresponds to the deltoid, from which it is separated by a triangular interval occupied by the cephalic vein, the thoracica hu- meraria artery, lesser pectoral, subclavius, infra-acro- mial artery, with a branch of the anterior thoracic nerve, and at the superior part may be felt the point of the co- xacoid process; the inferior margin forms the anterior fold of the axilla; anteriorly it is covered by the inte- gument, superficial fascia, with origin of platysma and mammary gland; it is also overlapped inferiorlyby the anterior edge of the deltoid, from which the tendon is S'jparated by a bursa, to diminish friction during con-

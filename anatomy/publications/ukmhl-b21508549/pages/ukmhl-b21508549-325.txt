315 MUSCLES OF THE BACK. P 2 groove to line it; the other passes over the long tendon of the biceps, binding that cord in its situation. As the trapezius and latissimus dorsi diverge as they ap- proach the base of the scapula, there results a trian- gular space in this situation of variable size in different subjects, bounded above by the trapezius, below by the latissimus dorsi, and in front the base is formed by the scapula In this are seen, when a thin fascia is re- moved, the inferior fibres of the rhomboideus major, tendinous slips of the sacro-lumbalis, and the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, with their attached intercostals; also the terminating branches of the posterior scapular artery. The anterior or abdominal edge corresponds, between the last rib and the crest of the ilium, to the posterior margin of the external oblique, bounding a triangular space in this situation, where a portion of the internal oblique, and the iliac branches of the internal circumflex artery and ilio-scrotal nerve are seen. We have sometimes observed that this space is absent by the fusion of the margins of the two muscles. It covers the sacrum, the longissimus, sacro-lumbalis, and spinalis dorsi muscles; also the serratus inferior, with the pos- terior dorsal and lumbar nerves, the ribs, the intercos- tals, and teres major. Action—To draw downwards and backwards the shoulders, to rotate the arm inwards and draw it back- wards behind the body, to raise the body as in climbing, and assist in the support of the trunk; probably it may also assist in inspiration. Now cut across the two last-described muscles, and reflect them outwards and inwards, this brings into view the second layer of muscles, consisting of seven, these being similar on both sides of the body, and mutu- ally overlapping each other:—rhomboideus major and minor, levator anguli scapulae, splenius capitis and colli, serratus posticus superior and inferior, rhomboidei—^ divided into a greater and lesser, but sometimes the se- paration does not exist. Rhomboideus MraoR.—Is above; it arises tendinous from the last cervical spinousprocess and ligamentum nu- chas, passes outwards and downwards, and is inserted into the base of the scapula, above the spine. The major arises

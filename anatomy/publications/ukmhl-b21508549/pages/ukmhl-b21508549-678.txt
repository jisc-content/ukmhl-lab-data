NERVOUS SYSTEM. 668 the ophthalmic, and in the remainder of its course within the skull, which does not exceed half-an-inch, lies close to the bone, being only separated from it by a thin layer of dura mater, being at first a little flattened, but as it passes through the foramen rotundum becoming cylin- drical and constricted by the margins of that apertur^; and whilst in the pterygo-maxillary fossa it loses the filamentous character which it possessed within the cra- nium, and becomes white and fasciculated, being easily torn into bands, often of a pearly whiteness; here the internal maxillary artery lies on its outer side, and the vertical plate of the palate to its internal. Subsequently entering the infra-orbital foramen, which lies at the junc- tion of the external and middle thirds of the spheno- maxillary fissure,—but sometimes farther outwards in- fluenced by the extent of the orbital plate of the palate bone and the depth of the os planum of the ethmoid,—it passes along this canal, lying on the infra-orbital artery, and escaping through the foramen of that name, between the outer head of the levator labii superioris alseque nasi, and the levator anguli oris, it divides into palpe- bral, nasal, and labial branches: the palpebral pass up- wards, supplying the integument and conjunction of the lower lid, communicating externally with the malar branch of the lachrymal, and internally with the infra- trochleator of the nasal; the nasal filaments run on the side and dorsum of the nose, supplying the integument, and communicating with the nasal of the ophthalmic; while the labial, which are numerous, run downwards and inwards to theupperlip, supplying the integument of that region, and there communicating with the facial nerve. Branches.—1. Ganglionic; 2. Superior dental; 3. Orbital; 4. Infra-orbital; 5. Anterior dental. Ganglionic Two branches descend from the in- ferior surface of the nerve, and being joined by filaments from the sympathetic, form Meckel's ganglion, which is an oval swelling of a grey colour, lying on the outer side of the ascending plate of the palate bone, at the su- perior part of the pterygo-maxillary fossa, and on the internal side of the internal maxillary artery in its third stage; occasionally this ganglion is absent, when the branches derived from the superior maxillary divide into

THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 280 retreating angle between them. Here the cartilaginous part commences, one inch in length, directed forwards and inwards, but it is not completely surrounded by cartilage, the deficiency inferiorly and internally being made up of fibrous tissue; at its termination the pos- terior lip is the more prominent of the two, and lies im- mediately behind the posterior, extremity of the inferior spongy bone. Eelations.â€”Superiorly it is in contact with the union of the spinous process of the sphenoid with the petrous portion of the temporal bone, both being grooved so as to form a half cylinder, deeper before than behind for the reception of the tube; more anteriorly the cartilage closing the anterior lacerated hole, the Vidian nerve, with the root of the internal pterygoid plate and body of the sphenoid, are above it; externally it corresponds to the middle meningeal artery, temporo-auricular, and inferior maxillary nerves, the latter being separated from it by the otic ganglion; still more anteriorly to the tensor palati, internal pterygoid plate, and pterygo-pha- ryngeal aponeurosis; internally to the petro-pharyngeal, aponeurosis, which it pierces, also the levator palati and mucous membrane. This tube conveys air into the ca- vity of the tympanum, in order to support the membrane stretched across the outer opening of that portion of the middle ear; occasionally its canal is obstructed, a change inducing Eustachian deafness; its permeability may be discovered by compressing the nostrils, closing the lips, and then forcing the air contained in the cavity of the mouth bacliAvards; if it obtain access to the tympa- num, it produces a crackling of the membrane perfectly audible to the experimenter. This tube is absent in fishes, and has a common opening at the posterior nares in birds. Its vascular supply is derived from the posterior auris, ascending pharyngeal, and the descending pala- tine, with twigs from the internal carotid arteries; its nervous, a branch from the lesser palatine nerve and otic ganglion. The mucous membrane lining the tube is pale, soft, and thick; the epithelium is clubbed and ciliated, but the latter character is peculiar to that of the tube, and never extends to the lining oi the tym- panum.

The first of these, or the superior vertical, forms a segment amounting to about iwo-thirds of a circle, its convexity bemg di- rected upwards, its concavity downwards, its position being marked out by a prominence on the upper surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; its exter- nal extremity, which is dilated into an ampulla, opening on ti upper and outer part of the vestibule; whde its internal, which unites with the corresponding one of the inferior vertical, opens on its upper and inner wall but without any enlargement. The inferior vertical describes nearly a complete circle; it commences on the fnner Bide of the vestibule, in connexion with the last arches at first backwards and slightly downwards, and Ten bending forwards and upwards becomes dilat^ !nto an ampulla, and opens on the back part o the v^- ITbular cavity at a very short distance from where it at W rommenced The horizontal canal arises on the fnfer rU of tt close to the common apert..e of the two vertical, and proceeeding outwards, and form- inronly a small segment of a circle, it opens on its oute^ Tn^e it ct^s^Tbirds, Ind from the soft spongy Wcter ofthe osseous We "ection may be and internal to the c-t.d canal a^^^^^^^^ on upper and --^^^^J^^ ^/l^eS^^^ Casscrian temporal bone, behind ^^^^ ^.^P^'^^'J'^'^'° ^^^^ compared gang'lion, -^-^^S ^l^S^.e^^^^ « -enK/caSX mol^s or columella, and a

SUPERIOR APERTURE OF THORAX. 531 2 A 2 anterior vaginal ligament descending between tliem, clothing the anterior surface of the spine. These parts will be found fully described with their proper systems. In concluding the anatomy of the chest, we wish to allude briefly to a temporary organ,—the thymus gland, and as it is peculiar to foetal life and infancy, it will be necessary for the student to obtain a very young sub- ject for its examination. The gland consists of two symmetrical triangular lobes, united in the mesian line by areolar tissue, but otherwise perfectly distinct, form- ing a mass of a pyramidal figure, which has the base below, corresponding to the fourth rib, and the apex above, attached to the thyroid body. The posterior surface rests on the pericardium, phrenic nerves, left vena innominata, arch of the aorta, arteria innomi'nata, left carotid and pneumogastric nerve; also on the tra- chea, descending thyroid veins, and middle thyroid ar- teries, while it is covered anteriorly by the sternum, cartUages of the first, second, third, and fourth ribs^ with the deep cervical fascia and sterno-hyoid and thy- roid muscles. At the third month of fa3tal life this organ is small but gradually increases until the eighth; it then becomes suddenly augmented, so that at birth it weighs about 240 grains, or half-an-ounce; and the growth further continues to progress until the termination of the first year. Each lobe contains a cavity, partially separated into a cervical and thoracic saccule by a constriction the former being superior and the smaller of the two' the latter inferior and the larger. These cavities are l^t Vn ""f ,^y'^^^ mucous membrane, and contain a whitish fluid like chyle, with a few red corpuscles Structure.—This consists of a number of follicles ranging m size from a pin's head to a small pea each possessing distinct fibrous walls. They usuall'y are globular or polygonal in figure, being in all cases sur- rounded by a delicate plexus of blood-vessels, which with fibrous tissue, form the medium of connexion with other lobules; their cavities are lined by a prolonga- tion of the general cavitary membrane, some communi- cating with the central reservoirs, others coalescing and afterwards terminating in the former situation,'

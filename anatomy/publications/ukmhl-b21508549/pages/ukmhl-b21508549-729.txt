SACRAL PLEXUS. 'JIQ the great sciatic notch, below the pyriformis, or it may occasionally emerge in two divisions, one of which will pierce that muscle, while the other will pass out beneath it, and descending nearly vertically downwards, until it reaches the upper part of the popliteal space, it di- vides into two branches: an external, the smaller, the peroneal; and internal, much larger,—the popliteal. In this course along the back part of the thigh, it rests on the small rotators outwards, between the tuberosity of the ischium and great trochanter, and covered by the glutEeus maximus, but farther down it lies on the adductor magnus, and beneath the hamstring muscles, supplying the adductor, the semitendinosus, semimem- Ibranosus, and biceps, as it descends, and being always 1 invested by a quantity of fine adipose areolar tfssue. Popliteal, or Posterior Tibial This, from its size : and direction, must be considered as the continuation of ;the great sciatic; it runs downwards nearly vertically 1 immediately beneath the fascia of the popliteal space .enveloped m fat, and then under the heads of the o-as- ttrocnemius, through the intercondyloid space, lying at rfirst external to its artery, and then crossing it obliquely ssp as to reach its inner side; passing now over the pop- ilitffius muscle, it descends between the heads of the ssolseus, and recrossing the posterior tibial artery in the -upper third of the leg, so as to lie external to it, it con- tinues Its course along the internal side of the teudo- .Achilhs to the space between the os calcis and internal ^malleolus, where it divides into external and internal :plantar, having, however, recrossed to the inner side of •the artery previous to its division, and being separated ;from It by one of the venai comites. Of its two terminal branches the internal is the largest; it runs at first downwards and forwards, till it reaches the groove be- neath the OS calcis, where it throws off a branch for the •supply of the integuments of the heel, and then, continu- ing Its course forwards and inwards, enveloped in a sheath of dense fibrous tissue, between the flexor di^i- torum brevis and flexor pollicis brevis, as far as the pos- terior extremities of the metacarpal bones, it divides mto four branches, which are distributed in the follow- ing manner:—The first, or most internal, to the inner

ARTERIES AND VEINS. 830 site the styloid process of the radius, and passes directly inwards under the flexor tendons, which it supplies, and anastomoses with a similar branch from the ulnar, interosseous, median, and twigs from the deep palmar arch. .11., Posterior Carpal.—About the same size as the last; arising from the radial as it lies in the triangular space already described, passes inwards beneath the extensor tendons, to which it distributes twigs, and anastomoses with the carpal from the ulnar, interosseous, and perfo- rating arteries from the deep palmar arch. Dorsalxs Manu.—Variable in size, but always pre- sent- it also arises in the triangular space, and, passing inwards along the bases of the metacarpal bones as far as the fifth, forms a species of arch, from the convexity of which it throws off three or four branches, which are distributed to the interossei, anastomosing with others from the deep palmar arch. Prinoeps Pollicis. —Always comparatively large; arising from the extremity of the radial, as it les be- tween the abductor indicis and outer head ot the pol- licis brevis, and passing out between those two muscles as far as the base of the first phalanx, it divides into two branches, one of which runs on the outer, and the other on the inner, side of the thumb, as far as the middle of the first phalanx, where, uniting, they form an arch, from the convexity of which numerous filaments are given off for the supply of the tactile papillae of the fan- ner while from either of its sides a small branch is de- tached, which, winding backwards and anastomosing at the root of the nail, forms a secondary arch for the supply of its matrix. .,11^ a Radialis Indicis arises in common with the last, and runs forwards also between the abductor indicis and adductor pollicis, and reachmg the base of he fiist phalanx of the index finger, anastomoses with the prin- cep pollicis by a cross branch; also with the superfici branch of the ulnar, completing in the absence ot the superficialis vola3 the formation of the superficial palnia arch continuing its course afterwards along the radial sSe of the indef finger, it terminates at the middle 0 s last phalanx in uniting with the digital branch of

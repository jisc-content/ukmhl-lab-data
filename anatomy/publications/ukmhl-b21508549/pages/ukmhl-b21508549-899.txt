889 VENOUS SYSTEM. m consequence of receiving all the muscular branches from the posterior and external part of the leg, and it opens into the popliteeal. When laid open it presents a cribriform appearance, in consequence of the muscular branches opening separately in the peroneal, and not by a single trunk. Anterior Tibial Vein—Also double; accompanying the corresponding artery, and passing through the in° terosseous space, they terminate in the poplitteal. Popliteal Vein. — About half-an-inch above the lower edge of the poplit^us, sometimes at the' inferior margin, the popliteal or main artery of the limb is for the first time accompanied by a single vein,—the poplitseal, which is formed by the confluence of the anterior and posterior tibial, and peroneal veins, which, however, all unite into single trunks prior to their confluence, and which, situated at first posterior and internal to the artery, in the middle of the space lying directly poste- rior, and superiorly being posterior and external, whilst at the oval opening in the adductor magnus, in addition to being posterior, it is also slightly external, a relation which is well seen when both veins and arteries have been injected. Collateral Branches.—Posterior saphenous, arti- cular, and the sural veins which ascend from the gas- trocnemius between its two heads, being remarkable for the number of their valves; superior muscular branches from the hamstrings likewise join it above. The popli- tasal vein is very intimately connected to the artery a little below the centre of the space, and inferiorly it always seems flattened on account of the peculiar manner in which the sural veins join it, and its coats are thick and extremely resisting. The Femoral Vein commences at the oval opening in the triceps, forming the continuation of the poplita;al, and lying in Hunter's canal directly posterior to the artery; about one inch above its commencement it re- ceives the ven£B comites of the anastomotica magna ar- tery, and at the apex of Scarpa's space it continues to hold the same relation, but from this point it gradually wmds upwards and inwards, appearing on the inner side of the femoral artery at a mean distance of two 2 Q

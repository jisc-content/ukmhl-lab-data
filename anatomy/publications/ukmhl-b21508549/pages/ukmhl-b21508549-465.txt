455 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH, short head of the biceps; the su perior fibres pass obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards; the inferior, with less obliquity, forwards, and are attached to a flat apo- neurotic tendon, which, descending, is inserted into the outer edge of the tendon of the rectus, upper and outer margin of the patella, and then sends an expansion over the synovial membrane of the knee-joint, to be attached to the head of the tibia. Eelations.—The anterior edge corresponds to the cru- reus, rectus, and patella, with its ligament; the poste- rior margin to the bone in front of the glutteus maxi- mus, and short head of the biceps; the internal surface to the femur, circular branches of the external circum- flex, which also separate it from the crureus; also to the synovial membrane gf the joint; it is covered externally by the fascia lata and the aponeurotic insertion of the glutasus maximus. Vastus Internus.—Similar to the last, lying on the internal side of the thigh; it arises from a ridge at the termination of the intertrochanteric line (anterior), above the lesser trochanter, from the line leading to the linea aspera, from its inner lip, and internal condyloid line; the fibres pass obliquely downwards, forwards, and outwards, form a tendon on the deep surface, not so well marked as in the external vastus, and is inserted into the internal side of the rectus tendon, upper and inner part of the base of the patella, and by an expansion into the head of the tibia. ^etowns.—Internally and anteriorly with the psoas and iliacus, sartorius, adductors, and femoral artery and vein; also with the profunda; the anterior edge overlaps the crureus, from which it can hardly be separated; the posterior margin is tendinous, and united with the ad- ductors, being covered by the internal hamstring mus- cles; by its deep surface it corresponds to the bone, crureus, and synovial membrane of the knee-joint. Crureus lies on the anterior and external surface of the femur; it arises fleshy from the root of the anterior intertrochanteric line, and Irom the anterior and exter- nal side of the bone, as far back as the linea aspera; the fibres pass downwards and forwards, and are inserted into the posterior part of the rectus tendon, upper edge

Anomalies.—It may arise from the subclavian, trans- versalis colli, or superior intercostal. ARTERIES OF UPPER EXTREMITY. Axillary Artery is the continued trunk of the sub- clavian, commencing opposite the inferior margm of the first rib, and, passing downwards, backwards, and out- wards, terminates in the brachial, at the lower margin of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. It is crossed above its centre by the pectoralis minor, and hence its division into three stages,-the first extending from the first rib to the upper margin of the pectoral; the second comprehending that portion which lies beneath the muscle; and the third reaching from its lower border to that of the latissimus dorsi and teres major.

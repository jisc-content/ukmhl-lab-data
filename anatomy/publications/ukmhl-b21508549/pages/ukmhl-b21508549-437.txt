PROSTATE GLAND. 427 The structure of the prostate cannot be well deter- mined when examined with the naked eye; it appears of a homogeneous nature, but with a low magnifier, after maceration in spirit, a section exhibits all the characters of a soft subfibrous texture, more dense as it surrounds the urethra than on the surface. The idea of a glandular structure is perfectly gratuitous; it is true that there are some involutions of the mucous membrane into its tissue, but they are so few in com- parison to the size of the body that they rather refute than confirm the opinion of its glandular nature. When the capsule is removed, the body is easily torn, particularly in the longitudinal direction, the lacerated surface appearing to be fibrous, these being apparently prolonged from the muscular tunic of the bladder. The use of the prostate is to fix the neck of the bladder, and is further of utility in preserving the position of the seminal ducts, its follicular secretion not possess- ing any manifest importance in the function of gene- ration. In the dissection made for the examination of the middle lobe of the prostate, an opportunity will be afforded for studying that body, first discovered by Morgagni, and subsequently minutely described by Weber, as the vesicula prostatica, now connected with the name of the latter physiologist as the Weberian or- gan. It is a small, flask-shaped vesicle, from a quar- ter to half-an-inch in length, and about two lines in width at its dilated portion, lying obliquely, the con- stricted neck turned downwards and forwards, the fundus upwards and backwards, bounded above by the uvula vesicae and the elastic tissue at the floor of the vesical cervix; also by the middle lobe of the prostate; below by Tyrrell's fascia; and laterally by the common ejaculatory ducts, with which it is imbedded in con- densed areolar tissue; its duct terminates on the ante- rior part or declivity of the verumoutanum, between the seminal openings. This organ is conceived to be a trace of the female uterus, and by others as the remains of the duct of the Wolfiian bodies. In order to obtain a good view of this structure the parts must be recent, and all pressure on the prostate carefully avoided J

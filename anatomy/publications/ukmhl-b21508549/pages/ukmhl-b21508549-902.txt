892 ARTERIES AKD VEINS. right lung, separated from the bronchus by the division of the vagus nerve, and opens into the posterior and ex- ternal side of the superior cava, about one inch above the auricle. This vein has but one valve, which is at its termination in the cava. We have seen it greatly di- lated in cirrhosis combined with contraction of the cava. Vena Azygos Minor.—Irregular as to size and exis- tence; it usually commences in the left lumbar region from the lumbar loop, sometimes communicating with the renal and suprarenal veins, and in one example we saw it receiving a small branch from the inferior mesen- teric, and in two, from the spermatic; then, ascending through a separate opening in the left crus of the dia- phragm, it passes upwards as high as the sixth dorsal vertebra, and, here crossing the spine, opens into the great azygos. • ^ n The PosTEBioR ExTRASPiNAL Veins consist oi a su- perficial set, which are subcutaneous, and a second, inter- muscular, which all communicate with the deep set; these latter appear as two longitudinal frequently in- flected trunks, lying on either side of the spmous pro- cesses of the vertebra, internally communicating by cross branches corresponding to the interspmous spaces, and these again sending ramusculi deeply between the ligamenta subflava to join the intraspinal vessels, and from the outer side of each trunk branches correspond- in^ in number to the vertebrae pass outwards and tor- wards, supported by the lamina of the spme towards transverse processes, dividing into ascendmg and descending branches to communicate with those above and below; they join the efferent veins of the spmal canal in th^ interval between the transverse processes Tntraspino-Rachidian Veins.-These are divisible into an anterior and posterior set, the former con si. ng of two longitudinal trunks lying on the posterior sur- te of the\odies of the vertebra, between the margm of the posterior vaginal ligament and the roots of the ^.rbrlPs extending from the foramen magnum to the Tasf of the coc^^^ -nd covered by the dura mater. These truls areLger in the dorsal and lumbar than in the cervical or sacral regions,-they are also alternately dilated and constricted from above downwards; inter-

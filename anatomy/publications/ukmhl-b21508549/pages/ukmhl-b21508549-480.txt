470 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. lies in contact with the neck of the femur; at its in- sertion it also has posterior to it the transverse fibres of the adductor magnus. The iliac sulcus exists be- tween the ilio-pubal eminence and the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, and the psoas escapes on its internal third, between the insertion of the psoas parvus and the iliacus, then between the latter and the pectineus, still having the iliacus to its outer side. Within the centre of the^muscle the lumbar plexus is formed. The psoas muscle is often the seat of abscess,—in the majority of cases consequent on caries of the vertebra. The matter in such instances follows the course of the muscle, be- coming evident in the groin, two circumstances pro- moting the descent of the purulent depot,—firstly, the lax areolar tissue, which connects its fibres to each other-, and secondly, the fibrous layers which inclose it, con- stituting the psoas sheath. Above the iliac fossa the anterior surface of the muscle is covered by the conti- nuation of the ligamentum arcuatum verum, and a process derived from the tendons of the crura, which also binds down the sympathetic nerve, whilst posteri- orly the strong anterior lamina of the transversalis ab- dominis tendon presents an obstacle to the escape of the contents in that direction rarely overcome. At the outer edge of the psoas the iliac fascia sends a process posteriorly, where it is also supported by the bone; but the principal portion of the fascia passes on the anterior surface, both becoming again continuous at the inner edge of the muscle. In the thigh the pubic portion Oi fascia lata divides into two laminas of unequal thick- ness, the posterior being weak, as the muscle is sup- ported in this situation by the fibrous capsule ol the ioint; but much stronger anteriorly, where it receives additional strength from the posterior layer of the le- moral sheath. In examining this sheath m the normal state many points exist where its manifest weakness ought to permit these accumulations to escape readily; but when it is recollected that the inflammation pre- cedincr their formation is slow and chronic, it will otter a sufficient explanation of the enormous thickening of the sheath observed in those cases, although every trace of muscular structure may have been removed, either

NERVOUS SYSTEM. 718 divides also into two branches,—muscular and cutaneous: the former being distributed to the origin of the ham- string muscles and rotators outwards, while the latter, emerging from beneath the edge of the glutseus maxi- mus, again subdivides into two,—an internal and exter- nal: the former, winding downwards on the inner side of the thigh, and becoming subcutaneous, supplies the integuments of that region, while the latter (long pudendal nerve of Soemerring) runs forwards and in- wards, and, crossing the tuber ischii, reaches the peri- neum, where it lies between the layers of the superficial fascia; here it anastomoses freely with the long peri- neal of the pudic, and continuing its course to the back part of the scrotum, it divides into two branches,—one of which runs forwards external, and the other internal, to the testicle, and, uniting in front of it, they form an arch from which nvxmerous filaments are distributed to the dartoid structure, septum, and skin of the front of the scrotum. PosTEEioR Cutaneous.—This may arise either sepa- rately from the plexus or from the greater or lesser sciatic, or from the inferior gluteal; it is always of small size, and it leaves the pelvis by the great sciatic notch, below the pyriformis, and running nearly vertically downwards, beneath the gluta^us maximus, it becomes cutaneous in the upper third of the thigh, and after distributing numerous filaments to the inte- ffuments of this region, its terminal twig may be traced over the popliteal space to the back of the leg, where it unites with the external saphenous, but m many in- stances it may be followed still lower, even as far as the back part of the malleolus. In order to avoid any confusion that might arise on this subject, we consider it proper to state that the three nerves last alluded to are sometimes described under one name,—the inferior glutseal, and in this case the posterior cutaneous and lesser sciatic must, of course, be considered as its dependent offsets. GuEAT Sciatic—This is one of the largest nerves in the whole body, and must be considered as formed not onlv by the four sacral nerves, but also by the communi- cating, from the lumbo-sacral. It leaves the pelvis by

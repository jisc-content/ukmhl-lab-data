Y46 NERVOUS SYSTEM. backwards, being reinforced in birds and fishes by a thin meniscus of cartilage, in the substance of the fibrous tissue, which is sometimes bony, as in the sea-bream (Professor Jacob). In the anterior part of the same structure fourteen or sixteen triangular plates sur- rounding the corneal aperture, occur, well marked m birds, but although present in reptiles they are more irrefTular; not so, however, in the ophidia as they are almost as well marked in that class as in the bird tribe. Structure of the Sclerotic.-lt is composed of white fibrous tissue, with a small amount of the yellow elastic form, the bands crossing each other at right angles, inclosing oval interfibrous spaces, most nume- rous posteriorly. The vessels which supply this part are derived from the palpebral branches ot the ophthal- mic, together with the ciliary vessels; but nerves have not been seen to terminate in it, while the absorbents are very numerous. , , i i Bdations.-^xtern^Wy it is covered by the ocular fascia receiving also the insertions of the recti and ob- ique whilst internally it corresponds to the ciliary vessels and nerves, which, entering it by a series of per- forations at its posterior part, separate it ^h^ choroid coat. When the deep surface is exammed its moothness is such that Arnold conceived that it wa^ lined by a serous membrane; but if a portion of its dark surface is sliced ofi" and submitted to microscopic exa- mTnatTon with a low power, the lax and watery areolar Xreads are most obvious, as the uniting medium of the sSt c to the choroid.

724 NERVOUS SYSTEM. perimposed muscles, are distributed to the integument on the posterior part of the neck. The posterior branches of the eight first dorsal nerves may be likewise described in conjunction, as they are all very similar in their course and distribution, but much smaller than the inferior branches of the posterior cer- vical. After their separation from the anterior corre- sponding division, each posterior dorsal nerve passes almost directly backwards in company with the vein and artery, through a quadrilateral space, bounded above and below by the transverse processes of the contiguous vertebrEc; internally by the intervertebral substance; and externally by the anterior costo-transverse liga- ment- reaching now the outer border of the semispi- nalis dorsi, they divide into two sets of branches,â€”mus- cular and cutaneous; the former supplying the levatores costarum and erectors of the spine, while the latter, after distributing some twigs to the semispmalis dorsi, wind backwards and inwards over its superficial surface, until they arrive at the spinous processes, where, piercing the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi, they are agam re- flected forwards between it and the trapezius, and agam perforating the latter muscle, they become subcutaneous, and are distributed to the skin of the thorax in broad, ribbon-like branches. The posterior divisions of the four last dorsal are very similar to theprecedmg, but their muscular branch is very small, and is distributed almost exclusively to the multifidus spinc% while the cutaneous, passing backwards through the muscular fibres of the erectors of the spine, which they very freely supply, next perforate the aponeurosis of the transversalis, internal oblique, and latissimus dorsi, and becoming subcutane- ous they divide into external and internal branches, the'former passing nearly vertically downwards, and supplying the integuments as low as the glutasal region, while the latter winds inwards towards the spine, to be distributed to the skin in that position.

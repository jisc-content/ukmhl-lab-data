722 NERVOUS SYSTEM. nerve; the external branch passes almost directly out- wards between the tarsus and extensor brevis, and is expanded in supplying that muscle as well as the in- terossei. Musculo-CUTANEOUS.—The second division of the pe- rouasal nerve; descends nearly vertically between the extensor communis and perona3us longus, and, piercing the fascia about two inches above the ankle-joint, and becoming subcutaneous, divides into two branches,— an external and internal; these pass over the annular ligament, and reaching the dorsum of the foot, the ex- ternal divides into three branches, each of which bifur- cates at the cleft between the toes; the outer at that between the fourth and fifth; the middle at that between the third and fourth; and the internal at that between the second and third: and these secondary branches sup- ply the skin on the dorsum and sides of the opposed surfaces of each of the corresponding toes; the internal division of the musculo-cutaneous, on the contrary, usu- ally continues as a single trunk to the cleft between the first and second toes, and here bifurcating, is distributed to their adjacent surfaces. This is the most usual course observed in the distribution of this nerve, but at the same time it must be remarked, that it is subject to several varieties in its ultimate ramifications. The MuscuLO-cuTANEOus Nerve while in the leg gives off two or three filaments to the peronajus longus, and one or two to the integuments over the external malleolus; it likewise freely communicates in the foot with both saphente. Posterior Spinal Nerves.—These may now be ex- amined in succession, commencing with the— First Cervical.—This is larger than the anterior division, and after its exit from the foramen of conju- gation passes backwards and inwards between the pos- terior half-arch of the atlas and vertebral artery, pre- senting here a kind of gaugliform enlargement; entering now into the triangular space, between the oblique and rectus, it divides into several filaments for the supply of those muscles and the complexus; it also communi- cates with the second. Second Cervical.—This is remarkable for its great

448 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. of the internal circumflex artery. We have sometimes found it absent, and in a few cases taking a much more extensive origin, so-as even to extend to the ascending ramus of the ischium, and in such cases it is twisted above the margin of the adductor magnus. Obturator Externus is seen by cutting across the last muscle, but it is only partially exposed, and should be examined again with the anterior region ot tde thigh: it arises fleshy from the inferior surface ot the circumference of the obturator foramen, from the obtu- rator ligament, and also from a strong fascia which completes the canal for the obturator vessels above; this origin is broad and expanded, whilst the insertion is narrow! the superior fibres pass obliquely downwards, forwards, and outwards, the middle horizontally; the in- ferior ascend a little outwards; they terminate on the surface of a strong tendon, which ascends backwards in a groove between the lower lip of the acetabulum and the tuber ischii, this groove being lined by a process of the capsular ligament and a synovial bursa; wmding now round the neck of the femur, and passmg upwards forwards, and outwards, it is inserted into the lowest part of the digital fossa of the great trochanter. ^ Relations JAnteMy it is covered by the pectmeus a strong fibrous arch, and the obturator nerve and artery; its lower edge is separated from the upper mar- gin of the adductor brevis by the internal circumflex artery; the deep surface rests on the bone and obtura- tor ligament; whilst in the groove it lies inferior and internal to the capsular ligament, then interior and pos- terior, and lastly, posterior to the neck oi the bone Son.-To rotate outwards, and to strengthen the capsular ligament interiorly and internally; likewise to aSTn adduction; during states of extreme abduction the tendon of this muscle is put on the stretch, afFord- ng powerful obstacle to dislocation into the obtura foremen, which usually takes place when ^he hnib^ arc widelv apart In a case of advanced rheumatic arthritis Tf the^Tioint we observed the tendon converted into bone and tie whole muscle degenerated in o a liga- mentous structure.

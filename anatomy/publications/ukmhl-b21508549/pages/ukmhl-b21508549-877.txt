ANTERIOR TIBIAL. 867 four digital branches from its convexity, which is turned forwards, and three from its superior wall, which are termed interosseous; the first digital branch passes for- wards and outwards, and is distributed to the outside of the little toe; the second runs to the cleft betweeu the fifth and fourth toes, and bifurcates for the supply of their adjacent surfaces; the third proceeds to the space between the third and fourth, where it also divides for their opposed sides; while the fourth runs in a simi- lar manner to the interval between the second and third and there divides for the supply of their approximated sides; all these digital branches, with their correspond- ing nerves, run close to the sheaths of the flexor ten- dons, to which they are bound by looped processes of the plantar fascia, and they observe an arrangement simi- lar to those of the fingers, forming arches on the last or ungual phalanges for the supply of the integument and matrix of the nails. The interosseal branches, which are three in number, are only found in the three exter- nal interosseal spaces; they perforate and supply those muscles, and anastomose with the dorsal interosseal branches from the metatarsal of the anterior tibial. Remarks.â€”Those arteries, but especially the external plantar, supply numerous branches to the fat and mus- cles of this region, with several filaments to the articu- lations, and, as the general rule, they lie deeper than their corresponding nerves. Anterior Tibial arises in common with the poste- rior, than which it is much smaller, from the poplitteal and passes directly forwards through a quadrilateral : space, bounded above by the edge of the poplitaius and itibio-fibular articulation; below, by the upper margin (Of the interosseous ligament; and on either side by the ttibia and fibula, being accompanied through this aper- tture by its two vena comites, communicating branch tbetween the anterior and posterior tibial nerves, and a ;few fibres of the tibialis posticus. On reaching the an- itterior aspect of the leg, it passes nearly vertically down- 'VTvards, at first between the tibialis anticus and extensor ^ccommunis, then between thetibialis anticusand extensor Fpolhcis longus, and lastly, between the extensor pollicis aand extensor communis, passing with the tendon of the 2 p 2

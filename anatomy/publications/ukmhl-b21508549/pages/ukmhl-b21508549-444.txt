434 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. anterior crural is seen perforating the fascia about an inch and a half below Poupart's ligament; also the crural branch of the genito-crural nerve is observed, piercing the fascia a little to the outer side of the femoral artery, and its branches are-seen descending to the midd e third of the thigh. At the outer side, half-an-mch below the spineof the ilium, the musculo-cutaneous nerve, abranch of the lumbar plexus, pierces the fascia lata, one branch passing backwards to the gluteal region the other be- coming cutaneous, and descending on the anterior and external side of the thigh. The inguinal glands consis of two sets, lying between the layers of the superficial tX the'superior, which are parallel to Poupart's li- gament, are large and few in number and have been described with the anatomy of mgumal hernia; the in- ferior are more numerous and smaller, and are parallel to the saphenous vein, one being always situated at the entrance of the vein into the saphenic opemng, and maW.en enlarged simulate femoral hernia; through Tese the superficial lymphatics pass m their course to Jeach the de^ep vessels. The internal saphenous vein a so appears through the fascia, the -P-- Po^^^ion ^ which should be cleaned to the point where it sinks deep- this large cutaneous vein commences on the dor sum of the foot, from the internal extremity of the tar- srarch ascends in front of the internal malleolus, on he" ner side of the leg, oyer.the gafocnemius P^^ internal and posterior to the internal condyle of the te n ir turns forwards over the sartorius, then ascends on Jhe vastus internus and adductor longus, but sepa- rated from them by the fascia lata, becomes arched-the ^^mveZy loouJ u^^'^^rds, and about one inch and a ouarte below Poupart's ligament it perforates the en-, Srifo^ tcia and opening, and termi^^^^^^^^^^ the femoral vein; the three '^Vfl^f^'l^^f^^^^^^^^ tioned open into its curve, and below * j\ [f^^^^^^^ the internal and posterior cutaneous vein of the thigh

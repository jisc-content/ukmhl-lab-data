2 D 1/ 601 SECTION y. NERVOUS SYSTEM. Before proceeding with the descriptive anatomy of the nervous centres, and those parts with which they are in immediate connexion, we think it judicious to prefix a few preliminary remarks on their structural peculiari- ties and recognised divisions. The nervous system has been divided into two orders, of lesser magnitude,—one the cerebro-spinal, which includes the brain and spinal cord, with the nerves emanating from or connected with them; the second being named the sympathetic system: the former having presidence over animal life connected by its nerves with the function of sensation, motion, and those of the more special senses; the latter maintaining, originating, and governing the functions of organic life, its filaments being principally distri- buted to the internal viscera and glands. But although possessing structural differences and functional distinc- tions sufficient to form the basis of a perfect division still, throughout the human body constant and intimate communications exist between the two systems, evi- dencing the mutual interdependence subsisting in their relations, as the exciters of that combination of actions wfiich, taken m their widest sense, si"-nify life Cerebro-spinal SysTEM.-Its structure consists of two very distmct elements,—the first being ^rev or cmeritious cellular or secreting; the second, white, tbro-tubular, and conducting. Grey or Cineritious NEURiNE.—This is found in numerous situations,—as on the surface of the brain in the optic thalami, corpora striata, crura cerebri' pons varohi, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord- also m and on the cerebellum. Its common constituents are,—agranular base, granular cells, ganglionic corpus- cles, and nucleated nerve fibres. The granular base

LUNGS. 499 up into bands or fasciculi that wave or interlace in irregular circles around the cells, tending to preserve their expanded condition, the latter consisting struc- turally of the thin and transparent condition of the mucous membrane on which the capillaries are ex- panded ; here thinning the wall to such an extent, that merely the flattened epithelium separates the capillary coat from the air, and in consequence of the tenuity and some peculiar pathological characters, the ultimate mu- cous lining is conceived to be similar to a serous mem- brane (Stokes). The approximative diameter of each air- cell ranges from l-70th to l-200th of an inch, the total number amounting to about six millions in both lungs. The capillary vessels are internal to the elastic bands be- fore mentioned, and are placed between the cells so that both surfaces of the vessel are subjected to the influ- ence of the atmosphere, the moist cell membrane being in a favourable condition to promote the mutual inter- change of elements between the inspired air and the venous blood, the oxygen of the former being consumed, and its union with the carbon, the effete product of the disintegrated tissues producing carbonic acid, which permeates the moist walls of the air-cell, while a further union of oxygen with hydrogen composes the pulmo- nary exhalation. The pulmonary artery at the root of each hmg conveys the venous fluid to the capillaries, and the blood, being arterialized by the influence of respiration, is returned by the pulmonary veins, two on each side; on the right the vein of the inferior and mid- dle lobes uniting, making the number of these vessels similar on both sides. The right pulmonary veins pass in their course to reach the left auricle behind the right auricle and ascending aorta, and in front of the spine, thoracic duct, vena azygos, and oesophagus, lying on the latter at the point where they pierce the pericardium, while the left pass anterior to the bronchial tube, de- scending aorta, and esophagus, behind the left auricle and phrenic nerve, ultimately terminating, like the right, in the posterior wall of that cavity. The nerves of the lungs are derived from the pneumogastric and sympa- thetic; the former at the superior margin of the root, giving off several filaments, that pass to the anterior surface beneath the curve of the vena azygos, forming

PERINEUM. 407 anterior, larger, supplies the bulb, which it pierces ob- liquely. Long and Transverse Perineal Arteries pierce . the ligament on the same line, but internal to the pudic; they pass through both layers directly. Dorsal Nerve of the Penis perforates the ligament half-an-inchbelow its apex, alsopassing directly through its layers. Dorsal Vein—This large trunk passes through a tubular aperture at the apex, immediately beneath the subpubic ligament; in addition, there are many smaller venous branches that, emerging from the crura of the penis, pass through well-marked openings in the ligament, and communicate with the prostato-vesical plexus. The uses of the triangular ligament are suiBciently obvious, bemg, to support the urethra in its passage, to alFord a plane on which the muscles acting on the urethra may be attached and fixed; it also sustains the prostate gland and anterior surface of the bladder, and consti- tutes a diaphragm between the perineum and pelvis anteriorly. Now remove the posterior layer of the triangular ligament, draw the rectum downwards and backwards, remove the thin layer of fascia which covers and adheres to the perineal surface of the levator ani, and when a lateral section of the pelvis is made hereafter, the pelvic surface can be more fully examined. Levatores Ani form a fleshy layer, which occupies the outlet of the pelvic cavity; each muscle is flat and thm, deeper behmd than before, and arises from the posterior surface of the symphisis pubis, inferior and external to the anterior true ligaments of the bladder ■■ It next arises from an arched tendinous band that lies between the splitting of the pelvic fascia, passing from the pubis to the spine of the ischium, and also from that bony point; the fibres are divided into four portions — namely, prostatic, anal, prfecoccygeal, and coccyaeal • the first form a flat band, the anterior fibres of which are inserted into the dorsum of the prostatic capsule, while the posterior, longer, pass round the gland, and arc at- tached into the central tendinous point of the perineum- the anal fibres are divisible into an anterior and poste- nor set; the former pass downwards and inwards, sepa-

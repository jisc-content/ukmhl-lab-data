OS INNOMINATUM. 51 and commencing inferiorly, we first observe a deep groove between the anterior inferior spinous process and pubal eminence; through this pass out the ten- dons of the psoas and iliacus muscles, with the anterior crural nerve between them. As we ascend we next meet with a well-marked prominence, the anterior in- ferior spinous process; from this arise the internal head of the rectus femoris, and accessory ligament of the hip- joint. Still higher up we reach a depression or groove for the passage of the middle musculo-cutaneous nerve; and highest of all an obvious eminence, the anterior su- perior spinous process, to the lower part of which is at- tached the sartorius; to its outside the tensor vaginae femo- ris, and to its point Poupart's ligament. Proceeding from this backwards we come to the crest. This is curved presenting anteriorly a convexity outwards, posteriorly a convexity inwards; broad in front and behind; sharp in the centre, giving attachment by its outer and inner lips for its anterior three-fourths to the glutteus medius and iliacus internus; by its anterior two-thirds to the external oblique, by its whole extent to the internal oblique and transversalis; by its posterior fourth to the glutEBus maximus, latissimus, dorsi, erectors of the spine, and quadratus lumborum. The crest terminates pos- teriorly in a sharp point, the posterior superior spinous process, to which is attached the ilio-lumbar ligament. We now descend over a thin, sharp part of the bone for about an inch, till we reach the posterior inferior spine, which gives origin to the great sciatic ligament. Curv- ing now forwards, and again descending downwards and backwards, it becomes broad, rounded, and smooth, forming the upper and anterior part of the great sciatic ; notch, under which the gluteal artery, with its vein and 1 nerve, passes outwards, sometimes grooving the bone 1 throwing off in its course a large branch, which perfo- I rates the edge of the notch, near its posterior part, and t establishing a remarkable anastomosis in the substance (of the bone, with the ilio-lumbar, which pierces the wall of the iliac fossa.

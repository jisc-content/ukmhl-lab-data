SUBLINGUAL GLAND. 269 rnian duct, and deep process of the submaxillary; the ;gustatory and lingual nerves and ranine artery are also :external to it; the genio-hyoid lies along its lower bor- der and the frtenum linguse, and a slip of the sublin- ;gual gland, correspond to its upper edge. Action.—The anterior fibres may depress the tip of I the tongue into the sublingual space; the middle fibres I may draw down the centre of the organ, rendering it I concave transversely; the inferior fibres will retract the t tongue if the os hyoides is fixed, as in deglutition; they Lalso, by acting from the chin, will raise the hyoid bone, . and thus protrude the organ; this is evidenced in hemi- ] plegia, the muscle on the sound side, by elevating the 1 bone, protruding the tongue to the opposite or paralyzed ihalf of the body. On the outer side of this muscle is :seen a longitudinal muscular fasciculus, named— Inferior Lingualts, pale in colour, a longitudinal ! fasciculus, wide behind, narrow before, attached poste- 1 riorly to the os hyoides, and passing forwards to the : apex of the tongue. Relations.—Externally hyo-glossus, internally genio- 1 hyo-glossus, below with the ranine artery, branches of 1 the lingual and gustatory nerves, the filaments of the Hatter piercing its substance; above with the central I muscular nucleus of the tongue. Action.—To shorten and retract the tongue. Sublingual Gland.—The third representative of the ! salivary system, is situated immediately below the mu- • cous membrane of the mouth; in size it scarcely exceeds a filbert, although a difi'erent estimate might be formed of : its magnitude until fully isolated from the deep process of the submaxillary ; it is bounded above by the mucous membrane of the sublingual space, below by the mylo- hyoid, separating it from the body of the submaxil- lary ; anteriorly by a depression on the posterior sur- face of the symphisis menti; posteriorly by the root of the tongue; internally by the hyo-glossus and genio-hyo-glossus muscles, above the edge of which it sometimes passes to reach its fellow of the opposite side; externally by the deep process of the submaxil- lary gland; its capsule is weak, and the whole gland is very moveable; the ducts are numerous and divisible

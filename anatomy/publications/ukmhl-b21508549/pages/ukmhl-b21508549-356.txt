346 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. inent, the posterior to the carpal bones; it envelops the superficial and deep flexors, the median nerve and flexor poUicis; in raising the superficial flexor we have seen frequently trabeculse, passing apparently through the sac of the bursa uniting these muscles; it is shallow where it encloses the flexor of the thumb, but larger where it surrounds the common flexors; in bursal in- flammation in this situation the anatomical arrangement explains the peculiarity of configuration; the swelling being well marked above the wrist, less so in the hand, whilst a depression corresponding to the unyielding an- nular ligament divides the tumour into two unequal portions. The division of the annular ligament to reach the bursa when diseased has been advised (Syme). The muscles in the third layer are seen by dividing the flexor sublimis, and in doing so, avoid the median nerve, which is closely united to its posterior surface; the following are then exposed, three in number,— flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus. Flexor Djgitorum Profundus vel Perforans arises fleshy from the inner side of the coronoid process, and the three superior fourths of the anterior surface, and inner edge of the ulna, and by a few fibres from the radius below its tubercle, also from the inner two-thirds of the interosseous membrane; passing downwards, it forms four fleshy slips; to these succeed a corresponding number of tendons, which lie in contact, the three inner being united by areolar tissue, and sometimes tendinous bands, but that for the index finger is always distinct and free; they pass beneath the annular ligament, enve- loped in the carpal bursa, expand in the palm of the hand, giving attachment to the lumbricales, and enter the di- gital sheaths, passing through the superficial flexors, and terminate by being inserted into the ungual phalanges. Relations.—It is covered by the flexor sublimis, the median nerve and median branch of the ulnar artery, by the ulnar artery, which lies above, between it and the flexor sublimis, and below separates it from the flexor ulnaris; also by the annular ligament, the superficial arcli of arteries and nerves, and the digital sheaths; it lies on radius, ulna, pronator quadratus, interosseous

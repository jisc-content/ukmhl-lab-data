CUBA MATER. 613 I minates in the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. But it will be necessary to examine the fibrous walls of this space, as well as the parts connected with it, a little more in detail, in order to understand its formation, and we must, therefore, return to the anatomy of the tentorium. On tracing the concave edge of this pro- cess forwards it glides over the posterior to be inserted into the anterior clinoid process, presenting superiorly a strong elevated margin, which splits into two layers, one weak and thin, passing inwards beneath the pitui- tary body, assisting in the formation of the circular and sphenoidal sinuses; the second, stronger, continued out- wards to form the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. The convex margin of the same process dips inwards to be connected with the posterior clinoid process, pro- ducing a decussation of the edges, and leaving between them a triangular space on which rests the third nerve; but this process has not yet assumed its final arrange- ment, for at the side of the sphenoid bone it splits into two layers, one of which sinks between the internal carotid and the bone, and can be traced outwards beneath the Casserian ganglion; the second also passes outwards, forming the internal layer of the outer wall of the sinus, and separating the nerves occupying this situation from the venous membrane, as well as forming a partition between the fossette for the Casserian ganglion and the cavernous sinus. The venous membrane within this space is loosely attached, constituting anteriorly a cir- cular canal, and posteriorly becoming oval where it joms the petrosal, in the former situation receivino- the ophthalmic vein, the proper fibrous coat of that vÂ°essel being prolonged for some distance on the venous sinus- but m the latter position it is destitute of any covering except the dura mater. On laying the cavity open a number of fibrous bands are seen crossing in every di- rection, but most numerous posteriorly, with several small arterial branches running through them, pro- ducing an appearance something similar to the corpus cavernosum penis, the apparent use of this structure being to prevent regurgitation of the venous blood towards the eye. We will now direct our attention to the parts related to this sinus, these being,_the ophthal-

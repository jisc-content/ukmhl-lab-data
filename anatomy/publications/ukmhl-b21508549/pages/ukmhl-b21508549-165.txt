LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 155 Transverse Ligament.—This is strong and dense, f stretching across the spinal foramen in the atlas, to be ; attached by its extremities to two small tubercles, which i are situated on the inner side of its lateral masses; it is : grooved anteriorly where it lies in contact with and em- i braces the odontoid process of the axis, flattened poste- 1 riorly, where it is covered by the apparatus ligamentosus icoUi; from its inferior margin a strong fibrous process (descends, which is inserted sometimes into the back j part of the body of the axis, and sometimes into that (of the third cervical vertebra; from its upper another I ascends, but much weaker, which is implanted into the I edge of the foramen magnum. The circular canal ; formed by the bone in front and the ligament behind i is lined by a loose synovial sac, which appears to be 1 much too large for it; the superior border of the liga- I ment likewise forms a larger segment of a circle than I the inferior—an arrangement which, from theconstric- 1 tion of the odontoid process at its junction with the 1 body of the bone, has a tendency to keep the parts more i inseparably united. This articulation is compound,—arthrodial between • the oblique processes, and lateral ginglymus between the odontoid and body of the atlas. Its principal, and indeed only, motion is rotation, and this is by no means as extensive as we would on a cursory view be led to suppose, as in turning the face to either side the whole of the vertebral column assists in the motion, more par- ticularly the cervical region. OCCIPITO-AXOID ARTICULATION. There is no direct union between the occipital bone and axis, as the atlas intervenes and separates them; it is, therefore, merely syndesmoid. The means of con- nexion are three powerful ligaments,—the apparatus ligamentosus colli, and the check, or moderator, or odontoid. Apparatus Ligamentosus Colli—To expose this it will be necessary to have a skull with the calvarium and brain removed; an incision must now be made with

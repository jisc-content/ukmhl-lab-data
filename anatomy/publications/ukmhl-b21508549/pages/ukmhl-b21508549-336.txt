THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. 326 of loops or arched fasciculi, behind the psoas magnus, and in front of the quadratus lumborura; this consists principally of arched and transverse fibres, and is strong superiorly, where it forms the ligamentum arcuatum ejsternum. It gives attachment vrith the preceding, or middle layer, to the transversalis only, and is covered behind by the quadratus, and in front by the psoas, lumbar arteries, some branches of the lumbar plexus and last dorsal nerves, some fatty cellular tissue, and the ascending colon on the right side, in its lower two- thirds, with the kidney in its upper part; on the left, by the descending colon and kidney, as on the right side. The operation of Callisen, in order to reach the descend- ing colon in the lumbar region, consisted in making a vertical incision along the anterior edge of the quadra- tus lumborum; while that of Amussat differs in some respect, the incision being transverse, commencing about two inches above the crest of the ilium, and carried outwards from the anterior edge of the quadratus lum- borum to the centre of that bone. In either operation, it will be necessary to be acquainted with the probable situation of the outer edge of the quadratus; we have found this to lie at a distance of two inches and a half to two and three-quarters from the spines of the lum- bar vertebrse. It should be borne in mind, that the de- scending colon is often loose and floating below, although perfectly fixed in its two superior thirds; it follows, therefore, the higher that the incision is made, so much greater will be the facility with which the intestine is reached; but again, the kidney may lie so low down that a danger of wounding this organ may result from the attempt to open the colon above the inferior third; the parts cut through in the operation are,—integument, su- perficial fascia, latissimus dorsi, three layers of the lum- bar fascia, some fatty areolar tissue, and then the colon is exposed,—generally uncovered by the peritoneum. This period may be taken advantage of for the pur- pose of examining the proper costal muscles. In order to accomplish it perfectly, a vertical section should be made through the dorsal vertebra3 and sternum; but we would not, however, advise that course at present, as a sufficient idea of these muscles may be obtained by

34 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. behind it presents a quadrilateral surface for the attachment of the teres major, and in front of this a grooved elongated channel for the origin of the teres minor. A large foramen is always visible m the mfra- spinous fossa near its upper part, for the nutritious artery to enter; of its three margins, the superior is the shortest; it commences anteriorly at the root oi the coracoid process, where it is deeply notched and to the lips of this notch, anteriorly and posteriorly, is attached the transverse ligament, converting it into a foramen, through which the suprascapular nerve en- ters while the artery of the same name passes above the'ligament, perforating the omohyoid, which arises from it and the adjacent bone. The rest of the su- perior border is gently concave, terminating m the posterior superior angle, rounded, and mto which the levator anguli scapulee is inserted. The posterior ed^e is the longest, and is very convex; it gives at- tachment to the serratus magnus and the two rhom- boids, the lesser of the two last-named muscles being attached to the space corresponding to the root ol the spine, the greater from that point to its inferior angle. The inferior or axillary margin is thickest and ge- nerally deeply grooved; posteriorly it is embraced by the origin of the teres muscles and subscapularis, while anteriorly, immediately behind the glenoid cavity it affords attachment to the long head of the triceps. The spine is that process which commences posteriorly by a triangular surface of variable extent, covered with cartilale and a bursal membrane at its posterior bor- der over which the dorsal fibres of the trapezius glide; and, becoming gradually more prominent, termmates anteriorly in the expanded acromion process: i pre- sents two margins; a superior, regular and slightly concave which gives attachment to the trapezius; an inS convex posteriorly, concave in tl- centre and again convex anteriorly for the origin of ^he deUo d The acromion, which terminates it m front, but takes a different direction, being inclined -P-^f ^'/-^"^^^^^^ external margin to which the attachment of the de to d is still continued; an internal border, covered w h cartilage and cut off obliquely to articulate with the clavick; a pointed process anteriorly which can be

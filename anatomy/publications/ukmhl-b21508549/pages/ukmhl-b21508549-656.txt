Formation of the Brain—It is tisual to describe the brain as consisting of four sets of fibres, namely, diverg- ing, converging, commissural, and fibres of conjunction. Assuming the medulla oblongata as their primordial centre, we will now proceed to trace generally those fibres: first, in the cerebrum proper, and subsequently in the cerebellum; but should the student be desirous of following them in their course, it will be requisite to obtain a brain hardened in alcohol, or boiled in oil, and having removed the aiachnoid and pia mater, he may then proceed to unravel the cerebral fibres with a wooden scalpel, and one or two portions of hard wood, of which one should be made extremely fine, and the other forked at the extremity ; he should also have the requisite means for allowing a stream of water to play on the pre- paration. It is a very troublesome operation, and re- quires great patience and address for its accomplishment. The DiVERGTNa Fibees of the Cerebrum are continua- tions from the anterior and posterior pyramids, also the olivary bodies; they may be traced, generally, as enter- ing the pons varolii, and passing through the corpus rhomboideum (or the ganglion of the pons), they seem augmented in size and number; then, entering the crura cerebri, and coming in contact with the locus niger, which separates the olivary from the pyramidal fibres, they again appear increased, and enter the optic thala- mus and striated bodies, interweaving with their grey neurine; they then continue outwards to reach the grey substance which covers the hemispheres, or that yellow- ish line internal to the grey border, named the linea flava of Soemerring; here they are looped, turning on themselves to reach the middle line, and terminating m the commissures, which are,—the corpus callosum, fornix, anterior, middle, and posterior commissures, middle per- forated plate, &c. Thus the diverging fibres have their origins in the medulla oblongata, whilst their subse- quent reflections on themselves constitute the con- ""^dIverging Fibres of the Cerebellum.—The resti- form bodies, passing backwards and outwards, enter the

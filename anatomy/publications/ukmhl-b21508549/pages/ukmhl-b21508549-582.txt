572 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. mass of nutrition whicli it received in its foetal condi- tion. To understand this clearly it will, therefore, be necessary to give a brief sketch of the fcetal circulation, and the changes which it undergoes to assimilate it to the adult. FffiTAL Circulation During the period of intra- uterine life, when the respiratory function is in abey- ance, the oxydation of the blood must depend upon the agency of some other organ besides the lung, and this is known to be the placenta, an extensive structure which occupies generally the upper part of the uterus, not exactly coeval with the existence of the embryo, but appearing to be formed completely about three months after conception by the gradual concentration of the villosities of the chorion at one particular point. In it ramify the umbilical arteries of the foetus, carry- ing at that period venous blood, the capillaries in which they terminate being remarkable for their minute size and the tenuity of their coats. These are frequently brought into contact with the uterine vessels, which at this period approximate closely to the inner wall of the cavity, and are equally conspicuous for their tortuosity, extreme caliber, and delicacy of their tunics; and the mutual approximation of the maternal and foetal vessels, thus favoured by their particular construction, permits an exosmotic and endosmotic action to proceed, removing the effete production from the one, and imparting the vivifying principle to the other. Divested in this man- ner of its impurities, the blood is taken up by the ra- dicles of the umbilical vein, which converge, and ulti- mately coalesce for its formation, and is carried by this vessel through the umbilicus of the infant, which is at this period patulous, to the horizontal fissure of the liver, in which the vein passes backwards as far as the transverse. At this point it throws off three branches to its left lobe and a single one to the right; the latter being remarkable, from the fact of its becoming directly continuous with the porta, the circulation of which at this time is only imperfectly established, its right branches constituting the right umbilical, to supply the corresponding lobe. Reduced considerably in size by throwing off these offsets, the umbilical vein continues its

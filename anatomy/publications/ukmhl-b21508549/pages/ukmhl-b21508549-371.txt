ABDOMINAL REGION. 361 space also differs with age; in the infant it is exceed- ingly convex, because the cavity contains the bladder and Its appendages, suprarenal capsules, together with the liver, an organ of great size at this period; but •with the descent of the bladder, the gradual diminu- tion of the hver, the absorption of the suprarenal bodies,—the hypochondrias lose their convexity and assume a slight concavity, visible below the cartila-es of the ribs ; the remainder of the cavity being also less distended. But when middle and old age appear It becomes again tense and prominent, in consequence ot tatty depositions within the omentum and mesen- ' tery,_facts that account for the greater frequency of hernial protrusions in infancy and old a^^e The ABDOMEN is divided into regions or zones, each having Its peculiar organs; an acquaintance with these subdivisions and the corresponding contents is of g-reat importance in guiding the prognosis of the surgeon in wounds penetrating its cavity. Region of the Abdomen—TMs region is divided into three zones :-the epigastric, mesogastric, and hy- pogastric. In order to map out these surfaces, certain lines are drawn encircling the trunk; the first would strike the base of the ensiform cartilage in front, and the spine of the tenth dorsal vertebra posteriorly sig- nifying the junction of the chest and abdomen the second surrounds the abdomen on a level with the car- tilage of the ninth rib, constituting the epigastric zone- of theiha, circumscribes the mesogastric region, whilst below It exists the hypogastric; if a line be^now Zvn from the cartilage of the ninth rib of each side above o the corresponding ilio-pubal eminences below, th^ three regions named will be again subdivided into nine the superior presenting the right and left hypochondria on each side, and the epigastric or scrobiculus cordis m the centre The epigastric region is triangular, with the base below, the sides formed by the arch ^f the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, the ensiform canilagc' projecting in its centre which is called scrobiculus cor- dis; it contams the left lobe of the liver and the sto xnach; more posteriorly the aorta, c<.liac axis, and solar

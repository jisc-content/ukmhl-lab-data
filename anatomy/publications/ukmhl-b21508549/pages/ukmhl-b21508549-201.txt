191 METATARSAL ARTICULATION. and sligbtly with the external cuneiform; it has a dor- sal ligament, which is double, but no plantar. A nar- row but strong band of fibres springs from the outer edge of the third cuneiform, and is implanted into the corresponding outer margin of the fourth metatarsal bone. A second arises from the upper surface of the cuboid, and passes horizontally forwards, to be inserted into the head of the same bone. An expansion of the sheath of the peronseus longus serves as its plantar li- gament. 5. The fifth metatarsal articulates with the cuboid only. It has one oblique dorsal ligament, extending forwards and outwards from the upper surface of the cuboid to the head of the metatarsal bone; but it de- rives additional security from other sources. Thus, below it is strengthened by the sheath of the pero- naeus longus, and externally by the insertion of the peronseus brevis and outer process of the plantar aponeurosis, which is inserted into the spur of the me- tatarsal bone. Synovial Membrane.â€”These are three in number, divided between the five metatarsal bones. One, as we have already stated, is confined exclusively to the first; another to the second and third; and another to the fourth and fifth. UNION OF THE METATARSAL BONES WITH EACH OTHER. This is amphiarthrodial, and the bond of rmion is by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments. The dorsal are a series of fibres, passing from the upper surface of one bone to the corresponding surface of the other, forming, in fact, a continuous band from the inside to the outside of the foot. The plantar are precisely simi- lar, but much thicker and stronger. Their principal security, however, depends on the interosseous, which stretch between the adjacent sides of the several bones They are short, but endued with vast strength.

410 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. well understood. On the inferior aspect of the glans the skin forms a fold continuous posteriorly with the prepuce, and in front with the inferior angle of the ure- thral orifice; this receives the name of " frsenum-prsepu- tiale," its use appearing to be to connect the prepuce with the glans penis during erection of the organ, and also to curve the orifice downwards in order to direct the seminal fluid backwards towards the os uteri; beneath the skin is observed the dartoid tissue, similar to that of the scrotum, with which it is continuous below; it is lax and fine, like the subcutaneous areolar tissue; this latter is abundant in all parts of the organ, and par- ticularly so between the layers of the prepuce, its ex- treme laxity accounting for the facility with which serous infiltration occurs; but at the corona glandis, on the glans and frsenum, it is much more dense; and in the latter situation its character is distinctly fibrous, the fibrillse being of unequal diameters, and often twisted into coils, the yellow fibrous element predominating. This subcutaneous areolar tissue is thick, and often lamellated at the root of the penis, where it is continued from the pubis as the false suspensory ligament; but anterior to this, it ceases to form laminae, becoming weak and reticular, but never adipose, as on the abdomen. The fascias of the penis consist of a superficial and deep layer, the former being derived from Scarpa's fascia, the latter being the expansion of the true suspensory liga- ment. The superficial fascia passes from the abdomen beneath the false suspensory ligament, and invests the whole organ, but cannot be traced beyond the corona, nor does any of its margin appear to pass into the pre- puce; on its surface the following parts may be seen:— above, the dorsal cutaneous veins and arteries; late- rally,'cutaneous branches of the dorsal nerve; and in- teriorly, the long perineal and pudendal nerves. DoKSAL Cutaneous Artery.—This is commonly . known as the inferior external pudic, a branch of the femoral; it pierces the proper sheath of that vessel, crosses the pectineus muscle, then perforates the pubic portion of the fascia lata, and divides into a superior branch, which crosses the crus penis near the pubis, then turns forwards, and can often be traced to the prepuce 1

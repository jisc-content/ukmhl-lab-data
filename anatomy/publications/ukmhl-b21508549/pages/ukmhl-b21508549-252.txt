242 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM, consists of three portions, which should be examined successively. The first, superficial or anterior portion, arises thick and tendinous from the lower edge of the malar bone and its apophysary tubercle; also from the zygomatic arch of the temporal to within half-an-inch of the articulation; it continues tendinous for one inch and a half of its course, then becomes fleshy, and, passing downwards and backwards, is inserted into the external side of the ramus and angle of the jaw. To examine the second or posterior portion, it maybe exposed by rais- ing the last described, commencing at the posterior edge, and dividing the tendinous septa which attach it to the bone; it arises from the zygomatic arch of the temporal, as far back as the tubercle for the origin of the external 1 ateral ligament, the fleshy fibres then pass downwards and forwards, to be inserted tendinous into the ramus of the jaw, as far down as the angle. The third, or deep portion, may be called transverse, and can only be seen by re- moving the zygoma, and turning it outwards; it arises fleshy from the internal surface of the arch, passes for- wards and inwards, to be inserted into the outer side of the coronoid process of the lower jaw, adhering to the insertion of the temporal muscle. Relations.— It is covered by the parotid, Steno's duct, the transverse facial artery and veins, branches of the portio dura, platysma, and fascia, inferior fibres of the orbicularis palpebrarum and the zygomaticus major; a small part of the posterior portion is superfi- cial immediately in front of the articulation. It lies on the ramus of the jaw, the insertion of the temporal, masseteric nerve and artery, external pterygoid, fat, and buccinator. When a transverse section is made of the muscle, the tendinous origin is observed to be con- tinued through the fibres, forming septa and dividing it into compartments. Action.—This is an exceedingly poAverful muscle, in consequence of its fibres being at right angles to the lever on which it acts. As a whole, it raises the lower jaw; but if the anterior fibres act alone, they elevate and draw it forwards, while the posterior elevate and draw it backwards: thus the alternate actions of the

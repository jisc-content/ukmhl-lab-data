MUSCLES OF THE NECK. 263 parallel to tlie digastric; the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus crosses deeply behind the two carotids, in its course to the thyro-hyoid space; the spinal accessory is also seen in the posterior superior angle, between the sterno-mastoid and digastric, with the following branches of the external carotid arising within the space,—supe- rior thyroid, lingual, facial, occipital, posterior auris, muscular, and ascending pharyngeal arteries. The Posterior Superior Triangle is bounded below by the omo-hyoid, behind by the trapezius, and in front by the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid; it con- tains the cervical plexus, a number of lymphatic glands, forming a chain along the posterior edge of the sterno- mastoid (glandulae concatenatEe); also the spinal acces- sory nerve, which crosses obliquely towards the acromial edge of the trapezius and twigs of the cervicalis super- ficialis artery, with the transversalis colli. The student should defer the more particular examination of the several parts enumerated until the muscles of the suprahyoid region have been described. Digastric.—To see the origin of this muscle the parotid must be removed, the sterno-mastoid raised, and the splenius capitis drawn backwards. As its name im- plies, it consists of two bellies, united by a central tendon, taking an arched direction beneath the ramus of the jaw; it arises narrow from a deep pit or groove, internal to the mastoid process of the temporal bone, forms a fleshy belly that passes downwards, forwards, and inwards, about an inch and a half from its origin; it becomes tendinous, and pierces the stylo-hyoid mus- cle, then is connected to the cornu of the os hyoides by a dense fascial pulley, and reflected upwards, forwards, and inwards; is inserted into the digastric pit, at one side of the symphisis menti, below the mylo-hyoid. Relations.—It will be seen that the origin of this muscle is thin, wide, and tendinous, similar to its inser- tion, with the intervening tendon, representing a double cone united at the apices, the narrow portion contained in a pulley with a synovial lining. In order to produce further security, the cervical fascia is firmly stretched between the tendons, covering the space above the os hyoides; this is sometimes described as the supra-hyoid

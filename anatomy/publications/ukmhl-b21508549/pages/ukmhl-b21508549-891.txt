881 VENOUS SYSTEM. PELVIC AND ABDOMINAL VEINS. The External Iliac Vein commences atthetermina- nation of the femoral on the linea ilio-pectiuea, passes upwards and inwards, and at the shoulder of the sacrum unites with the internal to form the common iliac vein. Inferiorly these veins lie internal to their corresponding arteries; the left then passing behind the internal iliac artery to reach the left iliac vein, so that it remains internal, and a little posterior to its corresponding trunk, whilst the right, during its ascent, gets behind its artery; but in a preparation in our own possession it continues to lie internal, passing first behind the right internal iliac, and afterwards behind the bifurcation of the common iliac. The external iliac veins are sup- ported by the iliac fascia and psoa3 muscles, being co- vered by the peritoneiim, Abernethy's fascia, and are crossed by the vasa deferentia and the epigastric arteries. The branches opening into the trunk are, the deep epigastric, which terminate in the inner and anterior part of the vessel, and the internal circumflex ilii, which, crossing the external iliac artery, opens into the outer and anterior part of the vein; both these veins are double, but they usually unite prior to their termina- tion, and the latter sometimes continues double, when one branch passes before, and the other behind, the ex- ternal iliac artery. Internal Iliac Vein commences by the confluence of the glutasal, sciatic, pudic, obturator, and lateral sacral veins which correspond to the arterial branches, as well as by the eflPerent branches of the pelvic visceral plexuses, which consist of haemorrhoidal, vesical, and in the female, uterine and vaginal. H^kmorrhoidal Plexus surrounds the inferior third of the rectum, lying external to the muscular tunic, and supported by the fibrous tubule derived from the lateral vesical ligaments; they communicate in front with the vesical plexus, and behind with the middle sa- cral vein, which connects it with the Eachidian system, and lastly it communicates with the deep haemorrhoidal plexus, which lies beneath tho mucous layer, being best marked near the anus. From this plexus the blood

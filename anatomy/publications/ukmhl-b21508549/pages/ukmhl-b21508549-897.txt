887 VENOCS SYSTEM. hind the inner condyle of the femur, receiving, just below this point, a communicating branch from the anterior tibial vein, which is remarkable from the num- ber of its valves; also the internal inferior articular vein; it then passes forwards over the sartorius, vastus internus, adductors magnus and longus; and whilst lying over the latter it is joined by the internal and posterior cutaneous veins of the thigh, by which it is increased to double its original size, and arriving at a point about fourteen lines (we have seen it only six) below Pou- part's ligament, it curves a little outwards and back- wards, and, piercing the cribiform fascia and the saphenic opening, which sends a tubule on the vessel, it terminates in the internal and anterior part of the femoral vein; whilst into its curve, the convexity of which looks up- wards, the superficial epigastric, circumflex ilii, and pudic veins open. During its whole course the internal saphena lies in the substance of the superficial fascia, and the valves are from five to seven in number, but in one case we counted nine,—six in the femoral portion and three in the crural; several communications occur be- tween this vessel and the deep veins,—namely, below with the internal plantar and calcaneal; at the inner con- dyle ofthe tibia, with the anteriortibial; abovethis, with the internal articular; and lastly, with the femoral. As the vein lies over the space between the tendons of the gracilis and sartorius, it is separated from the internal saphenous nerve, which lies beneath it, by the aponeu- rosis of the latter muscle; but at the inner condyle ofthe tibia the nerve is at first anterior, then crosses the vein, lying posterior, and lastly, it becomes anterior again. External or Posterior Saphena commences at the external extremity of the tarsal arch, and passing upwards and backwards behind the external malleolus, It receives the external calcaneal vein, and, ascending on the posterior surface of the gastrocnemius, the crural : aponeurosis intervening, and arriving at the centre ' ol the poplitseal space, it pierces the fascia, and opens linto the posterior and external side ofthe popliteal ; vein, opposite the flexure of the knee-joint. This vein 1 is accompanied in its upper fourth by the tibialis com- 1 municans, and in the remainder of its course by the

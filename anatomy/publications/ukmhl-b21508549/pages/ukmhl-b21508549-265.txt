255 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. the latter to the following muscle, — plastysma my- hoides vel panniculus carnosus, a flat subcutaneous muscle, longer than broad, thin, and often scarcely per- ceptible below, thick and fleshy above; it arises from the fascia covering the deltoid and pectoral muscles, passes obliquely upAvards, forwards, and inwards, over the cla- vicle, to which it adheres, reaches the chin and ramus of the jaw; becoming attached to the latter, and at the chin decussating with its fellow, it is inserted into the muscles of the lower lip, angle of the mouth, and lower edge of the orbicularis palpebrarum, some fibres ascending upon the fascial covering of the parotid to the zygoma. Relations.—Subcutaneous, some of its fibres being mixed with the basement membrane of the skin; it lies on the superficial fascia, and the parts which are beneath that structure, with the external jugular vein, and the superficial branches of the cervical plexus. Actions.—To draw down the integument of the cheek, retract the angle of the mouth, and corrugate the skin of the neck; it is the analogue of the panniculus carno- sus of the lower animals; in the otter we have seen this muscle nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness; it acts in this animal as a depressor of the lower jaw, but whether it may have any effect in urging the lymph through the glands and vessels beneath it, is question- able. Before this muscle is removed the following parts are seen through its fibres:—external jugular vein, auricularis magnus, occipitalis minor, and superficialis colli nerves; also, inferiorly, the supraclavicular and acromial branches of the cervical plexus. The ex- ternal jugular, formed in the inferior lobe of the parotid, as before described, or by an arched branch, which con- nects it with the internal jugular, passes obliquely doAvnwards, backwards, and outwards, at first beneath the superficial cervical fascia, but crossing the sterno- mastoid, it becomes superficial to that structure, con- tinues its course to the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, pierces the fascia, is joined by the transversalis humeri and colli veins, and, becoming a little dilated, opens into the subclavian vein, corresponding to the third stage of the artery ; it forms an exception to

ABSORBENTS. 897 The Sacral Glands lie on the posterior and lateral part of the rectum, supported by the sacrum between the layers of the meso-rectum; we have seen them form- ing a continuous layer around the gut in cancer recti. The pelvic are the vesical, which lie at the posterior part of the bladder, and in the female are likewise the vaginal and uterine. The Lumbar Lymphatic Glands are very numerous, the central set lying on the common iliac arteries, as ' well as between them; they also surround the aorta and vena cava, whilst the lateral are found in the inter- transverse spaces of the vertebrse. Lymphatic Vessels of the Lower Extremity. These are divided into deep and superficial, the former being, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal. The anterior tibial lymphatics are two in number, one commencing on the outer side of the foot, the other on the dorsum; both unite and pass upwards beneath the anterior annular ligament in the same groove with the anterior tibial vessels, and, passing through the anterior tibial gland, it pierces the interosseous membrane to arrive at the poplitasal glands, while the posterior tibial set, receiving the peroneal, ascend in the course of the vessels to reach the same structures. The superficial lymphatics commence on the dorsum and sole of the foot by an intricate plexus; then ascend- ing, those in front over the superficial surface of the muscles of the leg, they cross obliquely the upper part of the tibia, to reach a point behind the internal con- dyle of the femur; then continuing in the direction of the sartorius, they open into the inferior superficial in- guinal glands; a few lymphatics also accompany the posterior saphenous vein, and terminate in the most superficial poplita2al gland. In the thigh the deep lym- phatics follow the course of the femoral vessels, passing through the deep glands in company with the super- ficial lymphatics, that become deep by entering the saphenic opening, where they reach the iliac glands. The superficial lymphatics of the penis and scrotum pass outwards, and open into the superior set of super- ficial inguinal glands; and those of the gluta3al region also curve forwards over the glutasus maximus, medius, 2 3

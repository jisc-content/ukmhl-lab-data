CARPO-METACARPAL ARTICULATION. 209 zium and trapezoid is completed by anterior and poste- rior ligaments, consisting of two slips before and be- hind, stretching from the bone above to the two below, the posterior being much the thinner and weaker. In addition to the ligaments just described as connecting the preceding bones, the cuneiform and unciform have an internal lateral, which is rounded and strong. Synovial Membrane.—This forms one large sac com- mon to all the articulations. carpo-metacarpal articulation. The first metacarpal bone, or that of the thumb, articulates with one bone only,—the trapezium,—the surfaces of both being alternately concave and convex, forming a joint by mutual reception; it has only one ligament,—a capsular, which is loose, very strong pos- teriorly, but weaker and thinner in all other directions; it consists merely of a series of fibres stretched between the contiguous margins of the bones composing the joint, and has a separate synovial membrane; its mo- tions are very extensive, having them all exceedingly well marked, except rotation. Second Metacarpal This articulates with three carpal bones,—the trapezium, the trapezoid, and the OS magnum; its ligaments are the dorsal and plantar; the first consists of three,—an external, from the trape- zium ; a middle, from the trapezoid; and an internal, from the os magnum; they are all inserted into the pos- terior surface of the metacarpal bone; the palmar is thin and weak, and extends from the trapezoid to the anterior face of the metacarpal bone. Third Metacarpal This is united to one carpal bone only,—the os magnum; it is connected by two dorsal and three palmar ligaments; the first arise from the os magnum and unciform, and pass forwards, con- verging towards each other, to be inserted into the pos- terior surface of the metacarpal bone; the palmar take their origin from the trapezium externally, the os mag- num in the centre, and the unciform internally,—con- verge, and are implanted into the anterior face of the metacarpal bone.

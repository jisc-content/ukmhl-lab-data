456 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. of the patella, and into the synovial membrane of the knee-joint. n n i, v SuBCRUREUS—Beneath the last; a smaU, fleshy slip; arises from the anterior surface of the inferior faith ot the femur, also from the vastus internus; passes down- wards and forwards, and is attached to the synovial membrane of the joint, which it draws out from beneath the patella during extension. j ^- j Relations.—It is covered by the rectus and vasti, and lies on the bone and synovial membrane. Action —These muscles, when taken conjointly, are named quadriceps extensor cruris; the rectus flexes the thigh on the pelvis, and extends the leg on the thigh; the vasti and crureus only extend the leg, having no attach- ment to the pelvis; it will be observed how the uniform expansion of these muscles tends to increase the secu- rity of the knee-joint, and avert the many injuries to which the articulation is liable, both on account of its exposed situation, as well as the extensive surface it presents. Over the patella a large bursa exists, and between the fascia and quadriceps a second, correspond- ing to the ligament that connects that bone to the tibia, these two synovial sacs communicate; a third is some- times found over the base of the tubercle of the tibia, also communicating with those above, nor it extra ordinary that such communications should occur when it is recollected that these sacs are only n^od^fied foim of areolar tissue. The rectus has a proper sheath but the vasti and crureus are contained in a common invest- ment. INTERNAL REGION OF THE THIGH. There are five muscles in this region,—gracilis, pecti- npus and the three adductors. ^ G^ACTUS-Long and flat, like a band, situated o^^^^^^ inner side of the thigh; it arises by an oblong tendon Zm the symphisis pubis, between the spme and the ascSiding ramus of the ischium; the muscle then be- c mes flfshy, with P-allel fibres, aiid cours^^^^ wards on the inner side of the ^l"Sj' "^J,^''^"^^^^ ferior fourth terminates in a round tendon that passes

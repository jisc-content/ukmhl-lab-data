343 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. Pronator Radii Teres vel Eotundus Round above, flat below, placed obliquely in the upper third of the fore- arm; it arises tendinous and fleshy from the lip of the humerus above the inner condyle, also from that point of bone, from the fascia, and a strong aponeurotic sep- tum, which separates it from the radial flexor; also by a fleshy and tendinous slip from the coronoid process of the ulna, internal to the brachialis anticus; the median nerve passes between those osseous attachments; the fibres pass downwards and outwards, form a flat tendon by which it is inserted into the outer and back part of the radius a little above the centre of that bone; the tendon is first formed on the anterior surface, and is about an inch in length; sometimes the superior half of the insertion is tendinous, the remainder fleshy. Relations.—It lies on the brachialis anticus, the an- terior ulnar recurrent, and ulnar arteries, on the flexor digitorum sublimis, median nerve, and ulnar slip of flexor pollicis longus; it is covered by the semilunar and general investing fascia, by the radial artery and nerve, and the supinator longus, with the extensor carpi radialis longior and brevier muscles; the inner margin corresponds to the flexor carpi radialis, the outer to a triangular space, here overlapping the biceps tendon, brachial artery, and median nerve; the ulnar slip se- parates the median nerve from the ulnar artery. Actions.—First to pronate and then flex the fore-arm; from the favourable angle of its insertion its power is equal to the combined action of the supinators. Flexor Carpi Radialis lies internal to the last; it arises tendinous from the internal condyle and the fascia, with its intermuscular septa; becomes fleshy and passes downwards and outwards; at the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the fore-arm it becomes ten- dinous, and descends beneath the annular ligament, cross- ing obliquely the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, en- ters a groove in the os trapezium, sometimes common to it and the scaphoid, in which it is bound down by a fibrous layer, the groove being lined by a distinct bursal membrane, then expanding, is inserted into the head of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, sometimes into third metacarpal, and more rarely into a projecting . point on the trapezium.

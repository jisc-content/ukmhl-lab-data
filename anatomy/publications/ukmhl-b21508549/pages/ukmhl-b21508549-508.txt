498 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. divisions of the tubes, but its surface still retains tlie ciliated epithelium peculiar to the respiratory mucous tissue. When the tubes reach about the fifteenth divi- sion, the cartilaginous element of their walls ceases to exist, the elastic membranous tissue being all that re- mains of the former structures; the tube still divides, and the resulting canals undergo further subdivision, until each terminates in a separate air-cell, these being distinct, and merely communicating with each other through the medium of the central tube, the whole con- stituting a ptilmonary lobule (Reisseissen). This view has the advantage of much simplicity, and resembles the structure of the ramified secreting glands, but still it scarcely seems consistent to believe, that where nature required to create an extensive free surface, by which the blood may come in contact with the atmosphere, but that a more certain means of accomplishing that object would have occurred; and such is the fact, if the inves- tigation of Mr. Eainey is entitled to respect; and from certain circumstances connected with the comparative anatomy of the lungs, and numerous examinations of pulmonary tissue prepared in a variety of ways, it ap- pears to us that Mr. Rainey has approached nearer to the truth in many respects, than any other investiga- tor of this complex portion of structural anatomy, lhat the epithelium is present even in the air-cells is beyond question, but it becomes flatter, the ciliffi being scarcely if at all perceptible, a dense membranous layer existing external to this in the ultimate tubes, but without any muscular covering. Numbers of small branches proceed from the surface of the central canal, each small ramifa- cation terminating in a minute cell, whilst from its sides columns of cells arranged eccentric to the tube appear to form its walls; these cells communicate, the most in- ternal with the tube, and each succeeding co umn witli that which lies external to it; each tube, with its satel- lite columns of air-cells, constituting a pulmonary lobule These cells are variously figured, some being hexagonal or angular, others oval or elongated in the axis of the tube. The subfibrous layer on the pleural surface of the lung principally consists of an f liver), wh ch sinks between the lobules, and then breaks

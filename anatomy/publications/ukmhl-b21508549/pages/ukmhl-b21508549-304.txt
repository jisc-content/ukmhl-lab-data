THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 294 be constantly observed that persons having an excess of development in this situation exhibit frequently a pe- culiar weakness of voice and high pitch of tone. The su- perior cornua are occasionally observed to be merely ar- ticulated with the ala,—a condition which we have seen in a subject aged thirty-five years,—but the infe- rior cornua are a growth or prolongation from the ala, and therefore they are not at any period moveable. Cricoid Cartilage.—Annular or oval in shape, the cavity which it circumscribes being greater antero-pos- teriorly than transversely; it is situated between the thyroid cartilage and the trachea, forming the most fixed portion of the larynx. The lower edge is horizon- tal, thin, and occasionally irregular, attached to the first tracheal ring by elastic tissue, mucous membrane, and muscular fibres at the posterior part; the upper margin is oblique from above and behind, downwards, and for- wards, so that the posterior surface is at least five times greater in vertical extent than the anterior; commenc- ing this edge in the middle line posteriorly, a small notch is seen, bounded by two tubercles on either side; this is covered by the transverse arytenoidei and mu- cous membrane; the tubercles on either side form the commencement of the articulating surface for the ary- tenoid cartilages. To these we have seen attached, in many subjects, longitudinal arytenoid muscles, and often an origin of the inferior constrictor; the articu- lating surface for the arytenoid cartilage is observed more° externally, convex, looking upwards, forwards, and outwards, its long axis being directed downwards, forwards, and outwards; anterior to this, the crico-ary- tenoideus lateralis muscle arises, and in front ^^c^' vated for about three-quarters of an inch in width, and aives attachment to the crico-thyroid ligament, and bounds inferiorly the crico-thyroid space. The circum- ference is covered anteriorly by the integument and fasciee, and a slip of the thyroid body, usually a little to one side of the middle line; external to this, the con- vex surface gives attachment to the crico-thyroid mus- cle; still farther posteriorly, on a prominent angle, an oval, planiform, articular facette, looking backwards and outwards, receives the inferior cornu of the thyroid car-

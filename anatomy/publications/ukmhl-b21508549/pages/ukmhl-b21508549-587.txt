Its enlargement in certain diseases of the liver would seem to prove that it is in- fluenced m some measure by the condition of that <rland while again its enormous increase of size in intermit- tent fever would tend to establish the fact that it is more or less concerned in equalizing the circulation ge- nerally. Under all these circumstances, it may be faiPly admitted, that its peculiar properties require further elucidation, and that any opinions which have hitherto been broached concerning it will scarcely bear the test ot a rigid scrutiny. PANCREAS. This viscus is placed transversely in the abdominal fZ7k ^' at the same time obliquely, so as to occupy the left hypochondriac region, the epigastric, and um- bilical. In figure it is triangular and flattened, and it . has been divided into a head, body, and tail; the colour i IS pmkish grey, and it appears to be divided on its sur- face into a series of irregular lobules faintly mapped out 1 by a number of wavy lines; its head, which is thick and â–  rounded, lies in contact with the concavity of the duo ' denum, but is separated in some measure from it by its .own duct, the ductus communis choledochus and pan- > creatico-duodenalis artery; its tail is much smaller, and - corresponds to the hollow of the spleen; its posterior 9, r

381 INGUINAL HERNIA. ring. We cannot exactly agree with the anatomical de- scription given of this part in the usual works on that subject: any definite figure which it may present being purely artificial, unnatural, and delusive, fashioned with the scalpel, rather with a view to accommodate nature to descriptive prolixity, than with the intention of de- scribing structures as they really exist in their totality. This opening appears as a vertical slit on the abdominal surface of the fascia transversalis, the external margin being strong and lunated, the internal not so well de- fined, but appearing much thicker than the former. The deeper part of the internal ring is fully half-an-inch dis- tant from the internal epigastric artery, and should be styled its abdominal aspect; the vas deferens and sper- matic vessels passing for about a quarter of an inch be- tween the layers of the fascia transversalis before they pierce the external sheet, which is prolonged on the cord to the scrotum, constituting the internal spoutlike fascia of the spermatic vessels. The peritoneum should now be examined, and its peculiarities noticed in the ab- domino-inguinal region; in this situation the surface is irregularly concave, constituting the inguinal pouches; these consist of internal and external on each side, be- ing always perfectly symmetrical on the right and left sides. The external pouch, triangular in figure, occupies the space between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the epigastric artery; and this, it is conceived, will predispose to the formation of the oblique form of inguinal hernia; the internal pouch, quadrilateral in its outline, is bounded internally by the urachus, and ex- ternally by the epigastric artery, but this is again sub- divided into an external smaller space, and an internal larger, by the obliterated hypogastric artery; the ex- ternal division is subject to extreme variety in size, and even as to existence, these alterations being dependent on the course of the hypogastric with relation to the epigastric artery; sometimes they are so close as to be m contact, and this is particularly the case in the fe- male, owing to the width of the bladder, which guides that vessel upwards, or again from a quarter to three- quarters of an inch may intervene between them; a pro- trusion through the external division constitutes the

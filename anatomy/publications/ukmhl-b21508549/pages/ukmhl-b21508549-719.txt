LUMBAR PLEXUS. 709 areknowiibythefollowingnames:—Superiororilio-scro- tal, middle or small musculo-cutaneous, inferior or exter- nal musculo-cutaneous, and internal or genito-crural Superior or Ilio-scrotal arises from the first lum- bar, and IS large as contrasted with the others. It passes downwards and outwards, perforating the psoas to lie beneath the kidney, and on the transversalis aponeu- rosis, which separates it from the quadratus lumborum anterior to the outer edge of which it reaches the crest ot the Ilium, and, here perforating the transversalis, it divides between it and the internal oblique into two branches,--an external or gluteeo-cutaneous, which per- forates tlie last-named muscle, and then escapes between the margins of the external oblique and the latissimus dorsi to divide into filaments, which ramify in the in- teguments over the glute.alregion,-and an internal or continued trunk which pursues its course between the transversalis and internal oblique, close to the crest of the ilium and beneath the internal circumflex ilii ar- lZVJ\i T'^'' ^^^P^"°^ 'P^^ons pro- cess of the Ilium where it divides into two branches-1 an abdominal and scrotal; the former, after communi- ca ing with the small musculo-cutaneous, runs inward still between the same muscles, till it reaches the rectus where some of Its filaments are distributed to tha musl cle and others to the skin over it. The latter or sc^otel winds downwards till it reaches the cord, and wi^h i eaves the external abdominal ring, and divides fnto two branches one of which is lost in the upper and back-part of the scrotum, while the other suppSs the integuments of the groin ''i^ppiies tne ^ slender' VtT^' ^^^^^^^^-C^TANEous.-Extremelj ^Slender.

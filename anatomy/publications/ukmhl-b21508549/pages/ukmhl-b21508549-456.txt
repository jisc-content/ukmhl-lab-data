446 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. Strengthen the posterior part of the capsular ligament. When this muscle does not accurately fill the superior part of the notch, it predisposes to sciatic hernia, oc- curring between its upper edge and the glutaeus mini- mus; Ind when a dislocation of the thigh-bone occurs, into the sciatic notch, the head of the femur lies on this muscle, below the gluteus medius and covered by the glutseus maximus. The student should now recur to the description of the pudic and sciatic arteries, and also to the external branches of the sacral plexus. Superior Gemellus.-A round muscular band; it arises from the external surface of the spine of the ischium, passes transversely outwards, and is m^^erted into the digital fossa of the great trochanter, below the pyriformisfand above the tendon of the obturator in- ternus, with which it is intimately connected.

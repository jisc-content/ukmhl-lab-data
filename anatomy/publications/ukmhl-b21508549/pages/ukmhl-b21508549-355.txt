345 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. •would then be split by the tendon; the bursa of the lat- ter passes beneath the nerve and artery, and sometimes wholly surrounds the former; in the two inferior thirds of the fore-arm this tendon serves as a guide to the ar- tery, but the nerve is always closest to that structure. Actions.—To flex the wrist, the fore-arm on the arm; also to adduct; the power of this muscle is greatly in- creased by the intervention of the pisiform bone, which augments the angle of its insertion; the power is also increased in proportion as the fore-arm is flexed. Flexor Digitorum Stjblimis vel Perforatus is seen bydividingthe superficial muscles that havebeen already described, and constitutes by itself the second layer. It arises tendinous from the inner condyle, inner and ante- rior part of the coronoid process, tendinous and fleshy from the radius between the insertion of the supinator brevis and flexor pollicis, also from the fascia and intermuscular septa; it forms a fleshy belly that shows a tendency to a subdivision into four slips; to these succeed four tendons arranged in pairs,—two anterior for the middle and ring fingers; tv<ro posterior, smaller and often with a fleshy interruption for the index and little finger; these pass beneath the annular ligament in company with the deep flexor, median nerve, and the flexor of the thumb in- volved in a common bursa; diverging from each other in the palm of the hand, at the base of the first pha- lanx, they enter the digital sheath with the deep flexor, and at the middle point of that bone each tendon divides to allow the deep to pass through the slips; then unite posterior to the latter, forming a concavity for their re- ception, and again separating, are inserted into the mar- gins of the second phalanx. Belations.—lt lies on the flexor profundus, ulnar ar- tery, median nerve, which is to its outer edge; on the flexor polhcis, bursa, and phalanges. It is covered by a superficial layer, a strong fascia, annular ligament the digital sheath, and tendons of the deep flexor at the point of insertion. The bursal apparatus in connexion with these tendons requires a distinct description; it com- mences half-an-inch above the annular ligament and extends for fully one inch into the palm of the hand- the anterior surface is connected to the annular liaa- q3 °

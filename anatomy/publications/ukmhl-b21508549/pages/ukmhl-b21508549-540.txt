530 CAVITY OF THE CHEST. nominata is seen ascending upwards, forwards, and to- wards the rigbt side, and appearing above the sterno- clavicnlar articulation, lying about half-an-inch from the surface. A little to the left side of the latter the left carotid ascends, also supported by the trachea, and still more to the left side the subclavian is observed ascending on a plane posterior and external to that vessel; between the carotid and arteria innomi- nata the trachea passes downwards and towards the rieht side lying behind the left vena mnommata and arch of the aorta. The right phrenic nerve enters the chest, passing between the subclavian vein and artery, but the pneumogastric lies between the right vena in- nominata and subclavian artery, crossing tliis^f ^el at right angles, but on the left side lying parallel, but an- terior to it Both phrenics lie at first external, then anterior, and finally internal to the internal mammary arterv, this latter vessel on both sides being covered by the cok-esponding ven^ innomiaat^ as they enter the chest. Now draw the left carotid towards the right side and in the groove between the oesophagus and trachea the left recurrent nerve is seen ascending, and a iTttle external to this the thoracic duct, lying on the i ophagus internal to the left subclavian artery. The SaAranches of the fy-Pf J^^^^/^^^^^^ stanced differently on the right and left side,â€”m tlie ormer crossing the subclavian and arteria innommata, andTn the latler, with the exception of the inferior, which passes behind that vessel (subclavian on lett side) rev pass in the groove between the left carotid and subclav an arteries! In a depression between the trans- verse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the leck of ?he first rib, and internal to the vertebra ar- terv the inferior cervical ganglion is wedged, whilst a thick cord descends from it into the chest, to communi- ca e wTth the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic; still more posteriorly the superior I'lt^^'^^^f .^^^^^^ of thHubclavian enters the cavity in front of the neck : tfirstiib, and behind this the doi.ojbi.chid^^^^^^^^^ passes upwards ana their origins, with the

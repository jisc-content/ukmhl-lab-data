NKRVOUS SYSTEM. 640 fifth and seventli pair of nerves; before, to the crura cerebri, middle perforated plate, and the origin of the third pair of nerves. The superficial surface consists of the transverse fibres derived from the crura cerebelli; whilst a deeper section displays the diverging fibres of the olivary and pyramidal bodies, passing through the central light grey substance of the pons (corpus rhom- boideum) in their course to the cerebral hemispheres; in the middle line a few of the transverse fibres dip in- wards so as to form a septum, dividing the pons into two symmetrical portions,â€”an appearance well exhi- bited in a transverse section of this part. Crura Cerebri lie immediately in front of the pons varolii, thick, round, and directed outwards and for- wards ; they connect the pons with the cerebral hemi- spheres, being small posteriorly, and much larger and flatter anteriorly ; internally they correspond to the middle perforated plate, with the origin of the third nerve; externally, to the inner edge of the middle lobe, choroid plexus, choroid artery, and the tractus opticus; inferiorly, to the posterior cerebral artery, posterior communicating, and the optic nerve; and superiorly to the optic thalami and third ventricle. On cutting into its centre a mass of grey matter appears (locus niger), which separates the fibres of the pyramidal from those of the olivary bodies, and where the crura emerge from the pons some annular fibres surround them, while at their cerebral extremity they run directly into the optic thalami and corpora striata. The Cerebellum stands in a ratio to the brain as one to seven, lying in the inferior occipital fossae, and be- neath the tentorium. It is somewhat heart-shaped, and divided into three lobes, two lateral, and the third in the centre, the superior surface being obliquely sloped from the middle line downwards and outwards, while the inferior, convex, corresponds to the occipital fossse. An horizontal sulcus surrounds the margin, separating tlie superior from the inferior surface, terminating m front in a wide excavation (incisura anterior), which re- ceives the medulla oblongata, and behind, in the fissure, which is occupied by a falx cerebelli (incisura posterior). On the upper surface the cerebellum presents a median

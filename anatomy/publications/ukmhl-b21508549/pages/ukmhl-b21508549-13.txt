THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 3 Stance (gelatine) which confers toughness, elasticity, and pliability, united with calcareous and earthy salts, the elements of durability and resistance. In the adult period these present a certain proportion in relation to each other, producing the greatest amount of density and strength; but these relations are subject to changes, depending principally on the period of life, totally inde- pendent of any diseased condition of the system. During infancy the animal matter preponderates, whilst in advanced life the salts are in excess. On this account elasticity is as remarkable a physical character of the former as brittleness and a consequent liability to fracture of the latter period. The following are the proportions at different periods of life, from Schre- ger:- CHILD. ADULT. OLD AGE. Animal matter, .... 47-20 20-18 12-2 Earthy matter, .... 48-48 74-84 84-1 Or it may be stated, in general terms, that in the child the earthy matter forms nearly one-half the weight of the bone, in the adult it is equal to four-fifths, and°in old age to seven-eighths (Todd and Bowman's Physiology).

When the fluid is removed and allowed to cool, it solidifies, forming a transparent jelly. This may again be liquefied by heat, and from a dilute solution the animal matter may be precipitated by tannic acid, as tannate of gelatine. The insoluble organic matter con- sists of the fibrine and albumen, yielded by the coats of the blood-vessels and any small remains of blood they may contain. The calcareous salts are removed by digestion in dilute hydrochloric or nitric acids, leaving B 2

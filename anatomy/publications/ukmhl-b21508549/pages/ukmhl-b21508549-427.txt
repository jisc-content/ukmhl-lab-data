BLADDER. 417 dinary plenitude its figure is ovoid, the base resting on and closely applied to the anterior face of the rectum: but when the organ is over-distended by accumulated contents, its abdominal portion expands much more than the the pelvic, and it is then larger above and bent forwards. In the foetus and infant the axis is ver- tical, but in the adult it is oblique, represented by a line passing from midway between the umbilicus and pubis to the base of the coccyx, depending in a great measure on the altered axis of the true pelvis. °This membranous reservoir is retained in situ by the pressure of the surrounding parts, and also by its ligaments, which are divided into true and false. The latter are five,—two lateral, two posterior, and one superior. The lateral are folds of peritoneum, which pass from the iliac fosste and levatores ani to the side of the blad- der, and contain in their anterior edge the vas deferens -, the posterior ligaments are also folds of the same mem- brane, triangular in figure, the apex below between the bladder and rectum; the base, which is lunated, looks upwards and forwards; the peritoneal recto-vesical cul de sac lies between the ligaments of opposite sides, and each contains between its layers the ureter anteriorly, and the obliterated hypogastric artery posteriorly' The superior is a single fold of peritoneum, with which three ligamentous cords are connected, namely, the urachus in the centre, and the obliterated hypogastric arteries on either side; it unites the bladder to the rectus abdominis. When these have been torn from their attachments, a fascial structure is still observed to afford fixity to the organ, forming the true liga- ments four in number,_two lateral and two anterior. In order to understand fully the formation of these li- gaments, it will be necessary to examine the fascia in detail. When the iliac fascia reaches the brim of the pelvis It adheres intimately to the bone, receiving the name of pelvic, which descends into the cavity of the true pelvis until it attains the margin of the levator am; here it splits into two layers—the external or ob- turator, which passes external to the levator ani, covers and adheres to the obturator internus, and is attached to the descending ramus of the pubis and ascending of T 3 ^

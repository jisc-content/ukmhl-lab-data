Inferiorly in the mesian line we observe a sulcus, across which the arachnoid membrane is stretched, and on re- moving this, the inferior vermiform process is exposed, transversely rugated like a silkworm, and is divided into four portions:—most anteriorly, the nodulus, a pointed lobule, projecting into the fourth ventricle; im- mediately behind this, a grey elongated mass, named the uvula; still more posteriorly, a small blunted elevation representing the pyramid; and lastly, at the most pos- terior part of the inferior sulcus, or valley of Haller, the commissura brevis exists. On each side of the uvula two semilunar, flat, greyish white plates pass from the side of that part to the lateral lobes of the cerebellum where they are overlapped by the tonsillitic lobules, each anterior margin being lunated and free, the semilunar tossette between it and the nodule being called the ni- dus hirundinis, or swallow's nest: this structure consti- tutes the inferior medullary velum, whilst the superior IS formed by the valve of Vieussens. The surface of the cerebellum is divided into lamina;, which are separated by sulci, having their concavities all directed forwards and inwards, and by their aggregation constituting lobules, those on the upper surface being two, namely, the ante- : nor superior, and the posterior inferior, the latter beins the larger of the two. On the lower aspect five lobules are present, namely,_the semilunar, which is near the 1 posterior and lateral margin, being therefore circumfer- ential; secondly, the slender or gracilis; thirdly the di- .gastric, which is bifid externally; fourthly, the amyg- daloid or tonsilhtic, projecting internally into the valley ot Haller, and producing that peculiar arrangement of parts similar to those at the posterior portion of the mouth, there being in the vallecula—tonsils situated la- terally, uvula in the centre, and the inferior medullary

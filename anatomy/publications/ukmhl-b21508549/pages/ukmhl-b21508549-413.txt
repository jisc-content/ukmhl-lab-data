PERINEUM. 403 internal and above the superficial sphincter. It appears to be merely a thickened portion of the annular fibres of the rectum, and its use is similar to the last; both, however, appertain to the mixed class of muscles. Let the fat and areolar tissue be carefully removed on each side of the rectum, and a deep cavity,â€”the ischio- rectal fossa, -vvill be exposed; triangular in shape, the apex above, the base inferiorly; bounded externally by the obturator fascia, obturator internus muscle, and tuber ischii; internally by the rectum and levator ani; anteriorly by the transversus perinei and posterior layer of the triangular ligament; and posteriorly by the great sacro-sciatic ligament, overlapped by the gluteus maximus; the base is formed by the integument and fascia, and the apex at the origin of the levator ani; from side to side it measures one inch in the antero- posterior direction, and in depth about two inches; it contains a quantity of fat, the external hemorrhoidal vessels and nerves, and in the oviter wall lies the pudic artery, only separated from the space by the obturator fascia. The object of the space is to allow of distention of the rectum, and also permit of facility in its several movements. The large quantity of fat, together with its low organization, predisposes to the extensive diflfu- sion of matter, and the mobility of one wall of the ab- scess, together with the unyielding nature of the opposite, favours the formation of fistula. External Hemorrhoidal Arteries are two in num- ber on each side, arising from the internal pudic, as it lies in the triangular space internal to the tuber ischii; they pierce the obturator fascia, the anterior sending branches forwards to the transversus perinei, and then reaching the rectum, they form a circle of anastomosing branches on its surface; the veins which accompany those arteries terminate in the pudic, and the nerves are also branches of the pudic trunk. Now remove the erector penis, accelerator urinse, and the transversus perinei; also the long perineal artery, with the crus penis of one side, and the triangular liga- ment will be exposed. Triangular Ligament, shaped as its name implies, occupies the space between the diverging rami of the

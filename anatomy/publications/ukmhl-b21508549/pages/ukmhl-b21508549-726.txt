NERVOUS SYSTEM. 716 ani, and obturator internus; that for the first, arising generally from the third, divides into two, and sinks into its anterior surface; that for the second, likewise consisting of two, derived from the fourth, one of which is distributed to the centre, and the other to the ante- rior part of the muscle; and that for the third, which usually springs from the first, and, passing out through the great sciatic notch, and crossing the spine, enters by the lesser sciatic notch, and dividing into three or four filaments, is distributed to the pelvic surface of the obturator internus. In addition to these, it likewise supplies special branches to the superior gemellus and quadratus femoris. The external branches of the plexus are the pudic, inferior glutseal, posterior cutaneous, and lesser and greater sciatic. Pudic Nerve.—Eatber a large branch, springing from the posterior part of the plexus, generally from the third or fourth; it leaves the pelvis through the great sciatic notch, and, crossing the spine of the ischium where it lies inferior to its artery, it again re-enters it through the lesser, and reaches a triangular groove, bounded externally by the tuber ischii and obturator internus; internally by the obturator fascia; and mfe- riorly by the falciform process of the great sciatic hga- ment; here it divides into two branches,—the dorsahs penis and perineal: the former ascends through the anterior part^of the ischio-rectal fossa, between the obtu- rator internus, which is external to it, and the levator ani, which is internal to it, and on reaching the symphisis pubis it passes directly forwards below the subpubic ligament and above the triangular; runs now along the dorsum of the penis in company with its artery, but external to it; reaches the corona glandis, and, .sinking deeply between it and the corpora cavernosa, divides into numerous filaments, which, perforating the spongy structure of the glans, can be traced to the papilla; on its surface. About the centre of the penis it throws ofi" a large cutaneous branch, which, after distributing several twigs to the integuments of its sides and dor- sum, continues its course forwards, and is finally lost in supplying the folds of the prepuce. The latter or perineal division is much larger than that just described.

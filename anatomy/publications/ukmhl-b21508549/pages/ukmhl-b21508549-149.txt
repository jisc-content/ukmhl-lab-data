THE ORBITS. 139 cave; we find in it three bones,—the os unguis ante- : riorly, the os planum of the ethmoid in the centre, and the side of the body of the sphenoid posteriorly. In the • external wall are two bones only,—the malar in front, : and the great wing of the sphenoid behind. If we now ' contrast the length of the four walls, we will find that they present the following differences:—the superior is ■ the longest, the external the shortest, while the slight ' differences which exist between the internal and infe- rior preponderates in favour of the latter. The deep ' excavated groove in the rim of the external wall is very remarkable, evidently placed there by nature for the purpose of extending the range of vision in that di- rection, a similar arrangement not being required inter- nally, as the eye of the opposite side can fulfil the func- tions of its fellow. We will next proceed to the examination of the : several foramina which are found in the orbit; and first, with respect to the optic. This is a large hole, long transversely on its cranial aspect, and from above down- • wards on its orbital, directed downwards, forwards, ; and outwards, situated a little internal and superior to : its apex—in the side of the body of the sphenoid, trans- : mitting two very important parts into its cavity,—the I optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery. On a plane I external and inferior to this is the sphenoidal fissure, or : foramen lacerum orbitale, irregularly triangular in shape, with the base turned backwards, inwards, and down- ■ wards; the apex upwards, forwards, and outwards; it : is formed by the lesser wing of the sphenoid above, the : greater below, the body internally, and the junction of the two wings with the frontal, externally. The fol- : lowing parts pass through it in order from above down- ■ wards:—first, the fourth; second, the frontal; third, ■ the superior division of the third; fourth, the lachrymal; fifth, the nasal; sixth, inferior division of the third; se- venth, the sixth; eighth, the ophthalmic vein, with a few branches of the sympathetic; ninth, lachrymal branch I of middle meningeal externally; tenth, the dura mater, to form the periosteum of the orbit, and one head of the external rectus. The sphenoidal fissure separates ; partially the superior from the external wall of the

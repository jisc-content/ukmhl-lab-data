404 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. ischium and pubis, about one inch and three-quarters in length; it presents for examination two surfaces, apex and base, with two margins; the latter are attached to the rami of the ischium and pubis, where they are continuous with the obturator fascia, and as- cending or falciform process of the great sciatic ligament; the apex superiorly divides into two layers: one passes upwards on the posterior surface of the subpubic liga- ment and symphisis to become continuous with the lower edge of the anterior true ligaments of the blad- der; the other is prolonged on the dorsal veins of the penis; the base is badly defined, but when dissected, exhibits a double arch on each side of the mesian line, the central slip being attached to the middle tendinous point of the perineum; to the anterior margin of the base the proper perineal fascia is united; the posterior margin passes backwards on the perineal aspect of the levator ani, and is there continuous with a thin expan- sion from the obturator fascia; some bands are also prolonged into the ischio-rectal fossge, to separate the fatty tissue in that region. One inch below the symphi- sis pubis the triangular ligament is pierced for the exit of the membranous portion of the urethra, and as it passes through it, a process from the posterior sur- face is prolonged backwards on the intrapelvic portion of the membranous division, continuing backwards on the under surface of the prostate gland to form a part of its capsule, and at its posterior edge becoming incor- porated with the recto-vesical fascia of Tyrrell; from the anterior surface a process passes forwards on the spongy portion and bulb of the urethra, which gives the canal a smooth and glistening aspect, when the ac- celerator urinas is removed. In addition to the urethral opening there are three arterial perforations on each side, one neural, and a single tubular opening at the apex for the dorsal vein of the penis. The arterial perfo- rations are from without inwards,—for the internal pudic, long perineal, and transverse perineal arteries,—while the pudic nerve divides into an inferior or bulbar, and a superior or dorsal nerve of the penis; the latter ascending between the levator ani and pelvic surface of the trian- gular ligament, and, about half-an-inch below the apex,

GLUTEAL REGION. 443 Relations.—It is covered superficially by the skin, fat, and fascia, and lies on the parts which are seen when it is raised; in structure it resembles the deltoid, being coarse and fasciculated on the surface; the supe- rior two-thirds of the fibres are connected to the bone, but the inferior are attached to the fascia, over the vastus externus. Of the four margins one is connected to the sa- crum ; a second anteriorly overlaps the gluteus medius; and a third, thick and round, forms inferiorly the fold of the nates; the fourth being aponeurotic and attached to the femur. This muscle is atrophied in morbus coxEe. Action.—To extend the thigh, and preserve the erect position of the body; it is, therefore, much better de- veloped in man than in the lower animals; it also sup- ports the posterior surface of the articulation. Now cut across this muscle and reflect it; remove the thin layer of fascia from the parts beneath, and the following will be brought into view, viz.:—glutseus me- dius, its anterior fourth, still covered by a strong fascia; at its lower margin the glutseal artery, superior glu- taeal nerve, with the vein of the same name, separate it from the pyriformis, as it runs outwards, emerg- ing from the great sciatic notch; below the pyriformis, the sciatic and pudic arteries and veins, the pudic, great and lesser sciatic nerves, and the inferior gluteal when arising from the sacral plexus, and not from the lesser sciatic; then superior gemellus, beneath it the tendon of the obturator internus, inferior gemellus, tendon of obturator externus, covered by the quadra- tus femoris; then the latter muscle, and beneath it the transverse fibres of the adductor magnus, these being separated by the terminal branch of the circumflex artery of the profunda; and when the thigh is inverted by the lesser trochanter, and the insertion of the psoas and iliacus muscles; the great sciatic ligament is also exposed, the tuber ischii and the origins of the ham- string muscles, the great trochanter, and the bursa which covers that point of bone. This bursa is large and multilocular, one surface adhering to the bone, the second to the deep aspect of the muscle; a second bursa, smaller than the last, is often found between the tuber ischii and the muscle; and a third between its tendon

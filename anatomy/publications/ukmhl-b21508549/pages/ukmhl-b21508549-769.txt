THE EAR. canal. This tube is a little more than one inch in length extending from the base of the tragus externally to'^the membranatympani internally, and its direction is not per- fectly horizontal, but directed at first slightly upwards and then forwards and inwards; it is also partially con- stricted inits centre. Its external half is composed of car- tilage, which IS constituted by the bending inwards of the tragus and concha, which are united inferiorly but su- periorly an interval exists between them, which is filled lip by dense fibrous tissue, other fissures hem<y also apparent, but they are variable in number as well as in extent (incisure Santorini); the internal half IS osseous and had no existence in fcetal life, itbeino- at that period a mere bony ring, over which the membrana tympani was tensely stretched, a groove being always apparent in the adult bone, indicating the extent of de- velopment of the osseous portion, which, from the obli- quity of the tympanic membrane, is always longer on its inferior than superior wall. The canal thus formed is Imed mternally by an involution of the integument which IS remarkable for its tenuity and vascularity; its orifice IS protected by numerous strong hairs, springing principally from the roots of the tragus and anti-tragus! while in the subcutaneous tissue, but confined to the carti aginous portion only, are several cerumenous glands for the production of the peculiar secretion con- nltl ^ , ' f loiiring matter, and a substance nearly analogous to bile, which is always poured out rr/h ^rf,^'""'^]' tegumentary surface; its use, as wel a^ that of the hairs, being to entangle any foreign body that might enter the canal, and thus act injuriously oJ the delicate organ of hearing. Some anatomists h^ve X 1 fibres can be detected n the tube, which by their contraction may produce short ening of it, but this fact requires con'liLat^.n Middle Ear or TyMPANTJM.--In order to examine this cavity, the student should have several tempo a! bones, prepared by immersion in dilute muriatic ac d which will render them sufficiently soft to be divS.^ with a strong knife.

BRANCHES OF CAROTID. 789 Sublingual.—This, which is always a large branch, is given off at the junction of the second and third : stages, passes inwards between the mylo-hyoid and ge- : nio-hyo-glossus; and at the sublingual gland throws I off numerous branches to supply that structure, while the continued trunk passes upwards and inwards, form- : ing an arch with its fellow of the opposite side, above the frtenum, and behind the symphisis, from which se- 'veral twigs are thrown off for the supply of the teeth. Remarks—The lingual artery is sometimes exceed- ; ingly large, and at the same time remarkable for its 1 tortuosity; it is also variable in its relations to the I middle constrictor, occasionally passing between its j slips of origin from the cornu and appendix of the os thyoides, and occasionally being superficial to both. In lits termination as ranine, its filaments are very nume- irous, slender, and long, supplying both the muscles and 1 mucous membrane. Anomalies—The lingual artery repeatedly arises by a common trunk with the facial, but very rarely with the thyroid. Facial Artery.—Arises a little above the linaual I from the inner side of the external carotid, and, pass- ung at first upwards and inwards, till it reaches the unner side of the angle of the jaw, then turning ho- mzontally forwards beneath its ramus for about an inch aabruptly turns upwards and outwards over its inferior imargm, and continues its very tortuous course as far rns the internal canthus of the eye. Hence it has been Idivided into two stages,_a cervical and facial, in which .\t may be separately examined. Relations of Cervical ^ta^/e.—Anteriorly, integument f{)latysma, fascia, lingual nerve, digastric and stylo-hyoid muscles, facial vein, and a small process of the submax- lillary gland; posteriorly, stylo-pharyngeus, stylo-glos- S3US, glosso-pharyngeal nerve, submaxillary gland and pposterior edge of mylo-hyoid muscle; externally Jtylo- nmaxillary ligament, and insertion of internal pterygoid • Hnd internally it embraces the submaxillary trknd' within its concavity. ° ' Facial Stage—Anteriorly, integument, platysma tfascia, some fibres of the triangularis oris, zygomatics^ f

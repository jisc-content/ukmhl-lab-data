MUSCLES OF THE FACE. 225 head, but thick on the eyebrow, again thin and fine on the eyelids, thicker over the masseter, particularly in the male, but becoming fine and delicate on the cheek. Over the superior and inferior labial region its struc- ture is dense in the male, in consequence of the num- ber of hair bulbs, but their absence in the female ac- counts for the extreme fineness usually observed, at least before the middle periods of life. Beneath the skin, a layer of soft adeps surrounds and connects the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the face. This is prin- cipally seen on the cheeks and superior and inferior labial regions, but on the forehead it is scarcely pre- sent, absent altogether in the lids, and nearly so on the dorsum of the nose. This must be all carefully re- moved before the deeper structures can be examined with advantage. The muscles of the face in many subjects are weak, pale, and indistinct, particularly so in the aged, so that in many cases it requires an experienced dissector to exhibit them. They have been divided into superficial, or the muscles of expression; and deep, or muscles of mastication,—the former consisting of thirteen pairs and a single muscle, the latter of five pairs, which are perfectly symmetrical.

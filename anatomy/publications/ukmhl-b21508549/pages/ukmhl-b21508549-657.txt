647 DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN. inferior part of the incisura anterior, diverge in their progress through the corpora rhomboidea, and terminate at the surface grey layer, and from this point the con- verging fibres turn inwards to form the middle crura cerebelli, the transverse fibres of the pons being their commissure. The superior peduncles connect the mid- dle lobe of the cerebellum to the tubercula quadrige- mina, the valve ofVieussens constituting the commissure between them (Gall), but with equal reason the vermi- form processes may be assumed to be the commissures of the inferior peduncles or restiform bodies, as they are not only continuous with their fibres, but likewise unit- ing the lateral and middle lobes by their transverse bands. The following tabular view from Dr. Carpen- ter's work will facilitate the student in understanding the preceding description:— SPINAL CORD.

Development of the several parts of the Brain Theme- ■ duUa oblongata appears about the third week of foetal life, and up to the third month it is not limited supe- riorly, but at the commencement of the fourth month the pons becomes evident, consisting of transverse fi- bres. The cerebellum appears immediately after the ; medulla, being at first a single vesicular mass, formed 1 by the coalition of the restiform bodies, and at the 1 twelfth week forming a circular band, about one-third of an inch in width, surrounding the upper part of the 1 medulla and the tubercula quadrigemina; but as yet 1 being deficient of laminae or fissures.

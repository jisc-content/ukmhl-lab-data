NERVOUS SYSTEM. 732 spread out on tlie aorta, forming around it a complicated plexus interspersed with numerous ganglia; it gives off several filaments to the plexuses derived from the solar as well as to the hypogastric, to which allusion will presently be made. Sacral Ganglia.—Always irregular as to number, varying from three to five; they lie along each side of the sacrum, over the anterior sacral foramina, and covered by peritoneum and loose areolar tissue; com- municating above with the last lumbar by a cord which is generally multiple, and below, those of opposite sides uniting in an arch, convex downward, on which a fu- siform dilatation is often present (ganglion impar). Its branches consist of external, internal, and anterior. _ External Branches.—Filaments of communication to the nerves of the sacral plexus. Internal Branches unite with each other on the front of the sacrum, forming a plexus around the middle sacral artery. Anterior Branches unite with those of the lumbar ganglia, with the mesenteric plexus, and with those of the vesical and hsemorrhoidal in the male, and with the uterine and vaginal in the female, the four last being from the sacral plexus,—the complicated network formed by all these constituting the hypogastric plexus, which lies on the sides of the bladder and rectum, trom which smaller plexuses are derived,—viz. the vesical, hajinor- rhoidal, uterine, and vaginal, for the supply of those organs. ORGANS OF special SENSE. The special senses are five in number, namely,— Touch, Sight, Hearing, Smelling, and Taste. The three former will be described in the present section with the skin, eye, and ear; but the two latter have been already examined with the Anatomy of the Nose, page 130, and with the Tongue, page 287. THE SKIN. The skin, or tegumentary covering of the body, is a compound of an epithelial surface layer, supported on a

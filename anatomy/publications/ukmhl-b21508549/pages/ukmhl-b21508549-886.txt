876 ARTERIES AND VEINS, the junction of its middle and inferior thirds, also re- ceiving branches from the larynx, trachea, and (Eso- phagus, and, passing downwards, backwards, and out- wards over the common carotid, it terminates in the internal jugular; we have frequently observed the absence of this branch. Occipital Vein commences by long and tortuous branches in the dense skin of the scalp; these coalescing form a trunk which is sometimes double, and which follows the course of the occipital artery, terminating in the internal, and rarely in the external jugular; as this trunk lies on the superior oblique it receives the mastoid vein, which maintains a communication with the lateral sinus. Phauyngeal Vein is formed by a superficial and deep plexus, the former lying between the muscles and their fascial envelope, whilst the latter are situated be- neath the mucous layer; they unite to form a trunk, which is exceedingly variable as to its mode of termi- nation, that point being sometimes the internal jugular, the facial, lingual, or thyroid trunks. The Diploic Veins are observed by rasping oli the external table of one of the flat cranial bones, and they consist merely of the lining membrane, surrounded by an osseous sheath of condensed diploe; they communi- cate with each other in the distinct bones at all periods of life but in the separate bones only when the sutures have become obliterated by age; they also communicate with the sinuses and external veins of the scalp, but their peculiarity seems to be in presenting elevated lips of the lining membrane similar to valves, these being absent in the diploic veins of the general osseous system. It is almost superfluous to state, that each cranial bone has its separate venous plexus, as frontal, parietal, (tc. Anterior Jugular Vein commences m the supra- hyoid region in a variety of modes,â€”as from the inferior labial, or submental, and even from the facial vein itsell; and lastly, by branches of communication with the deep or the external jugular; it descends in the substance of the deep cervical fascia, internal to the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid, and over the sterno-hyoid muscle, and then, reaching the upper margin of the sternum, it

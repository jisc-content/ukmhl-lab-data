THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 256 the general rule of the cervical veins, being destitute of valves, this having two, one at the point where it crosses the sterno-mastoid, and the second at its termi- nation, but these valves are quite incapable of prevent- ing regurgitation. AuRicuLARis Magnus This nerve, a branch of the second cervical, passes at first backwards to clear the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, pierces the fascia, winds upwards, forwards, and inwards, on that muscle, parallel, but behind the jugular vein, and supplies the integument over the parotid and ear. The SuPERFiciALis Colli consists generally of two branches, with a similar origin to the last; they pass backwards, pierce the fascia, then run forwards and inwards, one superficial, the other deeper, than the jugu- lar vein, and terminate in the integument on the side of the neck and supra-hyoid region. The Occipitalis Minor lies at the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, beneath the fascia, and on the sple- nius, aponeurotic portion of the sterno-mastoid, and lastly, on the occipito-frontalis, and terminates in the integument of the scalp; its origin is also similar to the former branches. The SupEA-CLAVicuLAR and Acromial branches are derived from the third and fourth cervical nerves, are flat, like ribbons, and lie in the structure of the super- ficial fascia, pass over the clavicle and acromion, to ter- minate in the integument. Fascia or Fibrous Investment consists of several laminse, which may be divided into the superficial, mid- dle, and deep, or prevertebral layers; amongst these there is a perfect continuity, but in order that the de- scription of its parts may be understood, an artificial division is adopted by anatomists. The Cervical Fascia commences from the ligamen- tum nuchee, and can be traced forwards between the superficial and second layer of muscles on the back of the neck; it then passes forwards, covering the posterior lateral triangle, and, arriving at the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, it splits into a superficial and deep layer, which enclose that muscle; the superficial passes upwards over the ramus of the jaw, to which it is at-

At this point it is also covered by the internal oblique and intercostal nerves, which run forwards to reach the sheath of the rectus; the ileo-scrotal and ileo-hypogas- tric nerves pierce its iliac origin; also the internal cir- cumflex ilii artery, which courses along the crest of the ilium, between this muscle and the internal oblique. It lies on the fascia transversalis and peritoneum, also on the cord. Action.—Similar to the last muscle. Rectus Abdominis.—The fibrous layer should be dissected from its surface; but this is difficult to accom- plish at the tendinous intersections, but can be removed with facility below; long, flat, and wide above, thick and round below; it arises from the upper part of the crest of the pubis by an oval tendon, sometimes bifid, the fleshy fibres commencing on its posterior aspect: it soon becomes fleshy, passes upwards and slightly out- wards, and is inserted by three bands, the internal, short and wide, into the side of the ensiform cartilage, the middle into the cartilage of the sixth, and the external, longer and narrower, into the cartilage of the fifth rib; this last is occasionally continued upwards to the great pectoral, uniting with its external fibres, and even may pass upwards to the anterior lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus. Relations.—It is covered by the anterior layer of the sheath and pyramidalis; it lies on the posterior layer of the sheath, fascia transversalis, epigastric artery, and abdominal branch of the internal mammary; also on the sixth and seventh internal intercostals. Action.—In consequence of the tendinous intersec- tions which have been before alluded to, the several divisions of the muscle act in separate sections, from above downwards, so as to force the contents of in- testines towards the outlet of the body. These mter- sections sometimes are not complete, the fibres on the posterior surface of the muscle being continuous from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis. This is certainly the exception, although undoubtedly they are not as evident on the deep as the superficial surface ot the

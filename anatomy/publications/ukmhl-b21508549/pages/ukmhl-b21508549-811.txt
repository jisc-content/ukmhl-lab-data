801 INTERNAL CAROTID. ramen lacerum posterius and the parts passing throiigh it, with lingual nerve. On entering the carotid canal, the artery pursues a very tortuous course, first ascend- ing for about a quarter of an inch, then turning hori- zontally forwards and inwards, then upwards and back- wards, and ultimately upwards and forwards, grooving the cartilage which fills up the anterior lacerated hole, where its third stage commences. Relations—Second Stage—On either side a large branch from the sympathetic, which, uniting by cross branches, form a plexus around it; externally and in- feriorly, bony portion of Eustachian tube; internally and superiorly, the cochlea; and superiorly, Casserian ganglion, separated from it by a thin plate of bone, which is frequently deficient in advanced life, the gang- lion lying on the vessel directly, with the intervention of a fine layer of dura mater. At the point of the pe- trous portion of the temporal bone the cranial stage commences, proceeding at first upwards and inwards, to reach the cavernous sinus, then arching forwards to the anterior clinoid process, from which it again bends upwards and backwards, to terminate in its cerebral branches. Relations—Third Stage.—Internally, side of the body of sphenoid, which it grooves, and pituitary gland; ex- ternally, sixth nerve and venous membrane; anteriorly, optic nerve and anterior clinoid process; and posteri- orly, posterior clinoid process. Remarks.—"YhQ internal carotid, from its complicated and apparently contradictory relations, is ahvays an ar- tery of great difficulty to the student; but he should, in the first place, recollect that at its origin it is quite superficial, being, in fact, equally so with the external carotid, and to the outer side of that vessel. It should also be borne in mind tliat some of its posterior rela- tions, as, for instance, the internal jugular vein, lino-ual and glosso-pharyngeal nerves, though they do lie behind it at the base of the cranium, afterwards change their position as they proceed to their several destinations. Nothing, in fact, but an intimate acquaintance with the several foramina in this region will remove the intri- cacies of this subject, as well as a familiarity with the 2 M 3

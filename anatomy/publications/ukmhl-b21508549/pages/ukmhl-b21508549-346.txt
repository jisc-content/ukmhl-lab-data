THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 336 teres major, latissimus dorsi, and long head of the tri- ceps; it also lies on the inner head of that muscle, near its humeral attachment; the external cutaneous nerve and the nutritious artery of the bone pierce its tendon, which lies behind the inner edge of the bra- chialis anticus. Action.—To raise the arm, adduct, and rotate out- wards. Brachialis Anticus.—^tuated beneath the biceps, fleshy above, triangular in shape, tendinous below; arises by two fleshy slips, which embrace the insertion of the deltoid, also from the condyloid ridges and the anterior surface of the bone, and the intermuscular septa; the middle fibres pass vertically, the external downwards and inwards, the internal downwards and outwards; they terminate in a tendon which commences on the outer side, broad and thin above, becoming thicker as it descends, and is inserted into an oblique ridge, passing inwards and downwards, commencing at the coronoid process of the ulna. Relations.—The external slip lies between the triceps and deltoid, covered by the external intermuscular septum, and is the longest; the internal between the coraco-brachialis and deltoid. It is covered by the biceps, a small portion being superficial externally, by the brachial and anastomotic artery and veins, ex- ternal cutaneous and median nerves, brachial fascia; it lies on the bone, the anterior ligament of the elbow- joint, to which it is attached by fleshy fibres, and on the coronoid process; the external edge corresponds to the supinator longus, and the extensor carpi radialis longior, separated from them by the musculo-spiral nerve and radial recurrent artery, with anterior branches of the musculo-spiral; the inner edge corresponds to the ulnar nerve, internal intermuscular septum, triceps, and pro- nator radii teres. Action.—1o flex the fore-arm directly; draw it for- wards; also to strengthen the anterior ligament of the elbow-joint; some of its fleshy fibres are attached to this ligament, which draw the synovial membrane out of the joint during flexion.

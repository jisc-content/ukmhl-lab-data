SPINAL CORD. g53 but they borrow others from sources more remote, in order to obviate any dangerous results that might ensue from the accidental lesion of any particular part of the nervous centre in a function so essential to exist- ence. In the examination of the anterior and posterior sur- faces of the cord, grooves or furrows are observed on both aspects, but they differ from each other in the fol- lowing particulars:—The anterior being broad but shallow, dippmg into its structure for about one-third of Its entire depth, and limited in its deeper part by a thm band of white neurine, stretching completely across It; the posterior, on the contrary, is much narrower scarcely visible at first, and requires the opposite sides ot the cord to be gently drawn apart before it become'^ apparent; it extends into the substance of the cord for nearly two-thirds, and its floor is formed by a delicate grey lamina extending across it. From this view it will be perceived that the spinal marrow consists truly of two cylinders, united by a thin commissure, white anteriorly and grey posteriorly, each cylinder bein^ composed essentially of an external envelope of white neurine, within whichis deposited agrey mass, semilunar in fagure, with their convex margins directed towards eacli other, the commissure of the same colour and con- sistence connecting them. This may be distinctly ob- served on making a transverse section of the cord lu ■■ addition to the median furrows just described, two ; ^'''^^^ ^^tero and postero lateral, but not equally well marked,_the latter I being the more deeply indented, while the former is the ■more curved, as it commences on the side above and terminates on the front below; these grooves are sepa- . rated from each other by the attachment of the ligamen- .tum denticulatum; and in a transverse section of the • cord It will be seen that the sharp posterior horn of the ■ grey semilunar mass reaches out as far as its correspond- ing furrow, while the anterior, which is rounded and t)lunt, terminates about two lines before it arrives at the anterior. These fissures give origin to the roots of the anterior and posterior spinal nerves, which we will unow proceed to examine.

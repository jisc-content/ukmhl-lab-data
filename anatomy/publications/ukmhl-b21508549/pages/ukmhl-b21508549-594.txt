CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 584 The Renal Artery, an extremely large branch of the abdominal aorta, before entering the hylus of the kidney generally breaks up into five or six divisions, vfhich, on penetrating the organ, pass outwards between the conical masses, sending oflF a few long, straight branches, which ramify between and run parallel to the ducts of which they are composed, while the principal trunk continues its course towards the external or cor- tical structure, on reaching which it divides into two distinct sets of branches, one being destined for the sup- ply of the gland, its effete blood being taken up by the corresponding capillary veins, while the other (the af- ferent vessel) pursues its course to the flask-like dilata- tion of the convoluted tube, the wall of which it perfo- rates, and, becoming dilated, forms a complicated plexus ■within its cavity (the Malpighian tuft). Its dilatation and plexiform arrangement within the expanded extre- mity of the duct naturally produces a stasis of its con- tained blood, a condition most favourable for the exu- dation of its more fluid contents; and this is further increased by the small size of the efferent vein, which emerges from the dilated tvibe by an orifice much more contracted than that by which the artery had entered, an arrangement calculated to maintain a state of con- gestion admirably adapted for the exosmosis of the se- rous portion of the blood,—or in other words, the wa- tery constituent of the urine, which is urged into the tube by the continued action of a series of cilise, which are constantly in motion and propelling it onwards. The efferent vein, which emerges from the pouch, removing the efete blood of the Malpighian tuft, has been compared by Mr. Bowman to the portal vein of the liver; it unites almost immediately with the capillary vein of the nutritive artery of the gland, and the common trunk constituted by their union forms frequent plexuses with the convoluted uriniferous tube of Ferrein; and these vessels (we allude to the duct and vein) holding fluids of such different degrees of density, transudation is the natural result from their mutual contact one with the other (Dutrochet), and by this means the more solid contents of the urine are eliminated from the blood 1 he fluid thus formed is conveyed downwards through the

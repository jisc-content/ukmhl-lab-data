362 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. plextis, pancreas, cava, and portse. The hypochondriac regions lie beneath the last true and five false ribs, bounded below by the lumbar regions; the right con- tains the liver and suprarenal capsule, hepatic flexure of colon, pylorus, and duodenum â€¢, also the upper part of the kidney, suprarenal capsule, vena porta, cava, and hepatic vessels; the left contains the spleen, the great extremity of the stomach, splenic vessels, and splenic flexure of the colon, upper part of the left kidney, and su- prarenal capsule, together with the tail of the pancreas. The mesogastric region is divided into the right and left lumbar on each side, and the umbilical in the centre; the right lumbar contains the ascending colon, the kidney, and renal vessels, and in fffital life the testicles; in the left lie the descending colon, kidney, and renal vessels, also the testicle in early life; the umbilical contains the transverse colon and mesocolon, inferior transverse portion of the duodenum, and root of the mesentery. The inferior region is likewise subdivided into the right and left iliacs on each side, the hypogastric occupying the centre; the right iliac contains the ctecum, vermi- form process, the termination of the ilium, and fre- quently the convolutions of the small intestines; in the left lie the sigmoid flexure of the colon, commencement of the rectum, the lower and left extremities of the epi- ploon, with some convolutions of the small intestines; the middle or hypogastric region contains the small in- testines, great omentum or epiploon, and in fcetal life and infancy the bladder. There havebeen also described three in addition, as right and left inguinal and pubic; these more properly belong to the pelvic region, but here it may be stated that the inguinal contain the spermatic cords, inguinal peritoneal pouches, and hypogastric and epigas- tric arteries; in the pubic lie the bladder with its appen- dages, and the urachus. Although we have described the several divisions of the abdomen in this position, pre- (leding the anatomy of the contained organs, we would in nowise desire the junior student to dwell on this de- scription until he previously becomes in some degree con- versant with the size, position, and attachments ot the viscera, as then only will he be able to ;ippreciate the practical utility of the regional study of the abdomen.

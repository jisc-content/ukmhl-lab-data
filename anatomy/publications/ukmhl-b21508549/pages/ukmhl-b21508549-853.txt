COMMON ILIACS. 843 as far as the_ coccyx, it divides into two branches, which anastomose m reversed arches with the lateral sacral. Mdations.—AnUriorlj, aorta, left common iliac vein meso-rectum, and rectum itself; posteriorly, sacrum and coccyx; laterally, sympathetic chain of nerves which separates it from the lateral sacral Remarks.—This artery in its descent throws off branches, which enter through the anterior sacral fora- mina, to emerge by the posterior to anastomose with tJie superficial gluteeal. Common lLiAcs._The origin of these arteries maybe stated, as the rule, as being situated at the left side of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra, and extending trom this point downwards and outwards, they termi- nate a little internal, but opposite, to the corresponding sacro-iliac synchondrosis, the left being generally a little shorter than the right. ^ Relations.—On the left side:—Anteriorly perito neum, sigmoid flexure, superior hemorrhoidal artery and ureter; posteriorly, side of body of last lumbar Verte- bra, connecting ligaments, sympathetic nerve and shoul- der of sacrum, obturator nerve and transverse branch of middle sacral artery; externally, psoas and spermatic arteries and veins; and internally, its own vein. Eight side:—Anteriorly, peritoneum, last coil of Ileum, and ureter; posteriorly, similar to those on left side, with, in addition, its own vein, that of the opno- site side, and commencement of inferior cava- exter- Bally, psoas and spermatic vessels; and internally mid- dle sacral artery. i?mrt.-It will be observed that the vein of the left side does not be behind, but internal to, its corre- sponding artery, while that of the right is slightly in- terna to i below, directly posterior to it in the middle and slightly external to it above; the lumbo-sacral nerve IS also posterior and internal to both vessels but If some distance from them. vtbseis, out at Anomalies.-They are sometimes altogether deficient the internal and external iliacs arising independentlv from the aorta; and their length is very variSp / ^ one to three inches: occasionaHy thl^ ^i^'^rii ^^o tT last lumbar artery. ^ ^ ^ to the 2 0 2

1 358 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the ulnar nerve and artery, and it lies on the internal interosseous and metacarpal bone. Action To adduct with reference to the axis of the hand, but the opposite with regard to the middle line. LuMBKicALES are four in number, situated on the middle palmar space; each arises fleshy from the radial side of the corresponding tendon of the flexor profun- dus ; the two external also from the anterior surface; they pass downwards, terminate in round tendons, which run through the osteo-fibrous canal, between the heads of the metacarpal bones, in company with, but pos- terior to, the digital vessels and nerves, and surrounded by a bursa; the tendon then becomes flattened, passmg obliquely backwards, to be inserted, broad and expanded, into the extensor tendons on the back of the first pha- lanx of each finger. Eelations.—Thej lie on and between the flexor ten- dons, behind the digital nerves and vessels, and m front of the interossei. , Action —To flex the first phalanx, also to keep the extensor tendons closely applied to the posterior aspect of the phalanges, acting in lieu of a sheath. _ Now throw forwards the flexor tendons with the superficial arteries and nerves, provided the latter have been fully examined; also the extensor tendons from the posterior aspect, preparatory to the dissection of the interossei, which are as yet covered by a strong aponeu- rosis, common to them and the deep palmar vessels. Deep Palmar ApoNEUROsis.-This is irregular in shape, sometimes triangular, or it may be oblong; it is attached behind to the anterior carpal ligaments, which it covers, their oblique fibres being visible through its semitransparent tissue, and the posterior layer of the carpal bursa, which is inseparable from it; passing for- wards, it adheres to the ridges of the metacarpal bones; Txternally separating the adductor polhcis from th external interosseous muscle; internally the adductor mhiTmi digiti, from the internal interosseous; anteriorly ™es to the heads of the -^taca^l-/^^^exor the'c"• tinuous with the deep half segment of ^^^^ A^^^^^^^^^^^ here it is exceedingly dense and thick; in the interval

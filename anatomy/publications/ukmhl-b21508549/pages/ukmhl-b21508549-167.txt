LIGAMENTS OF THE SPINE. 157 of them, the apparatus ligamentosus colli behind them, except at their insertion, where they are covered by dura mater. OCCIPITO-ATLANTOID ARTICULATION. In this joint the occipital bone and the atlas are in contact at two distinct points, and it possesses but one motion, which is that of opposition, for this reason it is termed condyle-arthrosis; it is a most important articu- lation, requiring great strength, and accordingly we find that it has numerous ligaments for its security; these consist of an anterior, which is double, a posterior, two lateral, and two capsular, with a very loose syno- vial membrane. Anterior Occipito-Atlantoid Ligament.â€”To ex- pose this the pharynx must be removed in the usual manner, but in doing so we must be careful to make the section accurately between the cephalo-pharyngeal aponeurosis and the recti muscles, so as to leave the latter attached to the basilar process; these may be now detached from the bone, and reflected downwards, the fat and areolar tissue removed, when the ligament will be brought into view, consisting, as has been already observed, of two distinct portions, an anterior and a posterior; the first of these is always well-marked, is rounded atid cord-like in its appearance, attached above tothebasilarprocess, from which it stretches downwards, to be inserted into the tubercle, on the front of the atlas; posteriorly it rests upon the flattened portion, with which it is intimately blended anteriorly; it is covered by the recti majores, while on each side it has the two lesser recti, as they converge to their insertion; the posterior portion is weaker than the last, but much broader, particularly below; it arises from the anterior lip of the foramen magnum, extending out on each side nearly as far as the condyles, and descends nearly ver- tically to be inserted into the upper edge of the ante- rior half-arch of the atlas; posteriorly it rests on the point of the odontoid process and check ligaments, which separate it from the apparatus ligamentosus colli, while anteriorly it is covered by the greater and lesser recti, and its own rounded portion.

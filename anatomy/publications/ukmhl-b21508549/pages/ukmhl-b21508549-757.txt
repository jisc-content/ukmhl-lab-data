747 THE EYE. arises from its being more overlapped by the sclerotic in the latter situation; it consists of five layers from superficial to deep,-namely, conjunctival, anterior elas- tic cornea, cornea proper, posterior elastic cornea, and membrane of the aqueous humour. The conjunctival layer adheres very mtimately to the elastic tissue lyin. beneath It, which here constitutes the basement mem^ brane, the only element of the conjunctiva which is truly prolonged over the cornea being the epithelium, lhat there is a continuity of the sclerotic and corneal conjunctiva is proved by the fact, that in reptiles which cas off the skin annually the whole conjunctiva desqua- mates at the same period, the animal bein<? blind for a certain time, and likewise, when the eye is subiected to maceration, the entire layer can be torn off. The disease named pterygium raises the sclerotic conjunctiva, and when tu ly formed impinges on the cornea elevatmo- its mucous layer also from the elastic. This latter, named the anterior elastic cornea, consists of a transparent lamina of elastic tissue, perfectly homogeneous in its nature, covering the superficial surface of the cornea propria, and sending filaments deeply into its structure as well as from the margins into the sclerotic, as deep as the_ ciliary ligament, its use being to preserve thl requisite sphericity of the anterior f^ce of the cornea Ihe cornea propria consists of a peculiar modification of the white fibrous tissue expanded into a membranous form and constituting laminae from sixty to seventvTn number, united to each by filaments of LimilaTstTuc ture, forming areolae, differing from those of the sc^e rotic in being tubular, and crossing each other at acute V communication between the n These tubules have membranous walls, perfectlv trans" parent, their cavities being merely damped ly ZiZe but never m the normal condition containin;^ fluid and by the action of acetic acid nuclei become eviden 'as in the fibrous tissues of other situations.

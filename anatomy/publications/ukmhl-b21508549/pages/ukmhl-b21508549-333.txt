MUSCLES OF THE BACK. 323 atloid ligament, and occipital bone, and is covered by the splenius and complexus, with the occipital artery. Action To draw the head backwards and to one side, but it cannot produce rotation. Between these muscles a triangular space is observed, bounded above by the superior oblique; below, by the in- ferior oblique, the base formed internally by the rectus major, the apex being situated at the transverse process of the atlas; crossing from below upward and inwards is the great occipital nerve, or posterior branch of the se- cond cervical; beneath this a quantity of fat occupies the depression, and when this is removed the vertebral ar- tery becomes visible with the sub-occipital nerve, which is anterior and inferior to the artery, or nearer to the bone; also a branch of communication between the ver- tebral and occipital arteries, and a venous communica- tion between the vessels of the same name. Eectus Capitis Lateralis.—Arises by short ten- dinous fibres from the upper edge of the transverse pro- cess of the atlas for about half-an-inch; its fibres pass upwards and outwards, being inserted tendinous and fleshy into the transverse process of the occipital bone or jugular ridge. Relations.—Anteriorly, jugular vein and spinal acces- sory nerve, which is sometimes behind that vessel; pos- teriorly, vertebral artery and superior oblique; exter- nally, occipital artery; and internally the suboccipital and ninth nerves, which separate it from the rectus capi- tis anticus minor. Action To bend the head on one side. Having thus terminated the description of the dorsal and cervical muscles, we would now strongly recom- mend, that the particular attention of the student should be directed to that space bounded behind by the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebras; above, by the last rib, and inferiorly by the crest of the ilium. It is pro- bable that the subject has only been dissected on one side, and if such has been the case, a vertical incision carried along the spines of the lumbar vertebrae, with a second forwards, corresponding to the lower margin of the last rib as far forward as its cartilaginous extre- mity, and a third in a similar direction, on the crest of

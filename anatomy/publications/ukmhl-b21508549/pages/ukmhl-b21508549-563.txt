553 LARGE INTESTINE. exactly similar, as the ilio-colic stands out at nearly a right angle from the wall of the gut (the horizontal), while the ilio-cascal is more oblique, bending upwards and towards the right side (the vertical); the free mar- gin of the former being slightly concave, while that of the latter is alittle convex. From the angles of theorifice, where they unite, strong bands of fibrous tissue pass off, covered, of course, by the mucous membrane (reti- nacula), and are gradually lost on the circumference of the caacum, but they do not appear to unite, the pos- terior being evidently the longest and densest. The use of these valves is to prevent regurgitation from the large into the small intestine, but they do not seem ac- curately competent to perform this office, as the gaseous and liquid constituents will undoubtedly return. It may be scarcely necessary to add, that the closure of the valves depends upon the distention of the colon and cascum, which by separating the angles has a tendency to approximate their edges. Large Intestine—This consists of the cajcum, colon, sigmoid flexure, and the rectum, and from the peculiar direction which it pursues, is found in the following regions:—It commences in the right iliac by a dilated pouch, the caecum, from which it passes upwards through the right lumbar, till it reaches the liver (the ascending colon); from this point it stretches across the umbilical, forming a variable curve, the concavity of which is directed downwards and forwards, as far as the spleen (transverse colon); from this it again descends through the left lumbar, as far as the left iliac fossa (descending colon), where it becomes very tortuous, as far as the sacro-iliac synchondrosis (sigmoid flexure), and in the remamder of its course it is found in the pelvis, and known by the name of rectum. It may be here gene- rally stated, that the largeintestine gradually diminishes in size from the cascum to the sigmoid flexure, but again gradually increases in circumference from the latter to the lower part of the rectum, the whole con- stituting, in fact, two pyramids, with the apices united in the left iliac regions. Cecum or Caput Colli.—This is of a triangular shape, with the base above continuous with the ascend- 2 a

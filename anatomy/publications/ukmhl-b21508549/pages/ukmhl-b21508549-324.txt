THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 314 on the complexus, splenii, levator anguli scapulae, rhom- boids, latissimus dorsi, and supraspinatus muscles; on the occipital artery and great occipital nerve, which pierce it in this region; on the spinal accessory nerve, which strikes its anterior edge above the clavicle; and here also on the transversalis humeri and colli arteries. Action. To raise the shoulder, to draw it backwards, to draw downwards and backwards the occipital bone; both acting, may forcibly throw back the head. Latissimus Dorsi.—Triangular in shape, base at the spine, apex at its insertion. It arises by short tendinous fibres from the spines of the six inferior dorsal and all the lumbar vertebrse, also from the spines of the sa- crum, from the posterior third of the crest of the ilium, and by triangular slips, which indigitate with similar origins of the external oblique from the three last ribs, near to their anterior extremities; the superior fibres pass horizontally; the middle and inferior, with difi"erent deforces of obliquity, outwards ; the muscle then be- comes contracted, but still preserves its flattened form, and glides over the inferior angle of the scapula, from which it sometimes derives an origin, and again may be separated by a bursa; it then lies on the posterior sur- face of the teres major, then twists round its inferior margin to reach its anterior surface, forming a flat ten- don which is inserted into the posterior edge of the bi- cipital groove, and by a continuation, into the bone, as far upwards as the lesser tuberosity, above and before the teres major, from which it is separated by a bursa. Eelations.—lt will be observed that this muscle is attached to the lumbar and sacral vertebm by an apo- neurotic expansion, narrow above, broad below, firmly adherent to the spines of the vertebrae and sacrum, and laterally to the posterior fifth of the crest of the ilium and above this continuous with the fleshy sheet of muscle. It is covered by skin and fascia, by the cuta- neous filaments of the posterior lumbar nerves, and by the trapezius; in the axilla, by the axillary artery, vem and brachial plexus; coraco-brachialis and biceps he on its tendon, and these separate it from the tendon of the gre t pectoral, but still they are connected by a dense aponeurosis, one layer of which smks into the bicipital

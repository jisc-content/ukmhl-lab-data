CEREBRAL NERVES, Qjl I Glasserian fissure, and then, running downwards, for- ' wards, and inwards, it unites with the gustatory nerve 1 from which it cannot be separated, and, following the . course of that nerve, terminates by forming the sub- I maxillary ganglion, some anatomists also tracing a branch tto the lingualis muscle. _ SuBMAXiLLART Ganslion—A small oval body, of a : pinkish grey colour, situated on the posterior edge of ithe hyo-glossus muscle; two filaments descend from the .gustatory to join its posterior angle; whilst again, two others, arising from the anterior angle, ascend to join rthe gustatory. Farther on, a number of sympathetic ttwigs conveyed to the gland by the facial artery like- uvise enter into its formation, and from it branches pass tto ramify on the coats of the ducts. We have seen a iifalament from the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior den- ttal also joining it in one instance. There is some doubt aas to whether the chorda tympani really enters the -ganglion as a branch of the superior maxillary, many :authorities being disposed to leave the Vidian with the : portio dura, and tracing a distinct branch of the latter in company with the gustatory, into the submaxillary :?Iand, to preside over the rhythmic motions of its ducts iind from that continuing to the lingualis muscle, con- ■3tituting Its motor nerve. The Orbital Branch enters the orbit throuo-h the fpheno-maxillary fissure, and passing upwards and for- wards, between the outer wall of that cavity and the pe- riosteum, divides into a temporal and malar branch: the ormer, escaping through the orbital plate of the malar oone passes through the temporal muscle and fascia ii^nd, becoming superficial, terminates in integument of ihe temporal region, communicating with the portio l^'J^'^'^T'T''''^'' serves; while the latter unites with the malar branch of the lachrymal, follow- ing Its course to the cheek. Superior Dental BRANCHEs.—These are two in iuumber, superior and inferior, arising from the nerve uust before it enters the infra-orbital canal, first sending ■ tew branches to the buccinator and fat in the vicinity- ■■'hey enter proper canals in the bone, and, passing for-

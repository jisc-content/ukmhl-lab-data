825 BRACHIAL ARTERY. mus dorsi; winding now upwards, into the infraspinous fossa, and lying close to the bone, it divides into two branches,—an anterior, to anastomose beneath the spine Avith the infraspinous of the suprascapular, and a pos- terior, which descends to communicate with the pos- terior scapular and continued trunk of the subscapular. Remarks.—The point of division of the subscapixlar into the two terminal branches just described is very variable, ranging from a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half, and although we have followed the general rule in making the posterior or circumflexus scapulae pass through the triangular interval, of which -we have given the boundaries in the preceding paragraph, still our experience would lead us to state that such is rarely if ever its true course, as the vessel pursues its course backwards close to the inferior costa of the sca- pula, to which it is united by a dense fibrous arch, which protects it from the pressure of the teres minor, above and not below which it is situated. Anomalies.—The subscapular may arise from the pos- terior circumflex, and occasionally from the long thoracic. Brachial Artery.—The direct continuat'ion of the axillary, commencing at the inferior margin of thelatis- simus dorsi and teres major, and passing downwards, forwards, and outAvards, terminates a little above the coronoid process of the ulna, by dividing into radial and ulnar. Relations—Anteriorly, inner margin of biceps, me- dian nerve, and semilunar fascia, which separates it from the median basilic vein and internal cutaneous nerve in the triangular hollow at the bend of the elboAv; pos- teriorly, long head of triceps, but separated from it by the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda, short head of the same muscle, coraco-brachialis, and bra- chialis anticus; internally, brachial aponeurosis, inter- nal cutaneous, and, lower down, median nerve, with ba- silic vein; and externally, coraco-brachialis above, and median nerve in the middle cellular interval between biceps and brachialis anticus; and iuferiorly, tendon of biceps. Remarks.—it will be observed that the median nerve holds three relations to the artery, being at first slin-htly 2 N 3 °

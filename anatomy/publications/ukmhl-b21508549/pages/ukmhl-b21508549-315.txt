305 MUSCLES OF THE NECK. ■.with the first rib, between the anterior and middle sca- i.leni, completing, in this situation, the upper boundary ^ of the thoracic wall, where it is pierced by the branches i.of the brachial plexus in their course to reach the axilla, I as well as the subclavian artery. On these several parts • tubular prolongations are sent, which adhere to and ; strengthen their structure, conferring a degree of resist- l ance calculated to avert the injurious effects of tension, I to which they are liable during extensive movements of Ithe upper extremities. Its physiological relation to the 1 lungs is also of much importance in protecting these (organs from the effects of atmospheric pressure, an ofEce I that, from its peculiar resisting nature, it is perfectly i adequate to sustain. Pathologically considered, the 1 utility of this fascia is tinquestionable; in the cervical 1 region preventing abscess consequent on caries of the ivertebrse becoming diffused amongst the lax areolar I tissue of the neck, whilst the costal portion opposes an (effectual obstacle to the passage of scrofulous collections (of matter into the thoracic cavity, and when the fre- I quency of glandular diseases in this region is remem- 1 bered, with their tendency to impinge on and compress (organs in their vicinity, the advantage resulting from a : resisting wall of fibrous tissue will be at once recognised. LoNGUs Colli.—Narrow and tendinous above, broader 1 and fleshy below; it arises from the sides of the bodies I of the three superior dorsal vertebras, from the stellate Uigament, head and neck of the first rib, also from the t transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth, the ! bodies and intervertebral substance of the same cervical ivertebrte; it ascends obliquely upwards and inwards in ttwo fasciculi,—an internal and external; the former i arising from the bodies, the latter from the transverse ] processes of the vertebrae, and is inserted tendinous into 1 the forepart of the bodies of the three superior cervical 1 vertebrEe. Relations—The deep surface rests on the spine, the i inner edge is separated from the opposite muscle by t the bodies of the vertebrse and the anterior vaginal li- : gament below; but superiorly they converge and con- ceal these parts. The external margin is separated from t the anterior scalenus by the vertebral artery and in-

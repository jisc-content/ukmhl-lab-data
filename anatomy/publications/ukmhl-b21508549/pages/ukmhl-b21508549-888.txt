ARTERIES AND VEINS. 878 stantly subjected were they placed on the palmar aspect. The digital veins consist of long branches running on the sides and posterior aspect of the fingers, and fre- quently communicating with each other by plexiform branches at the metacarpo-phalangeal sulci; those of the opposed surfaces unite, constituting trunks which, opening into an irregular arch, form the collateral branches of the dorsal venous arch, this giving off from its external and internal angles the cephalic and basilic veins respectively. p t, i i Cephalic Vein commences on the back of the band by a branch from the thumb, one from the index finger, and from the external extremity of the dorsal venous plexus-, it then winds forwards over the supinator longus tendon, and about the junction of the inferior and middle thirds of the fore-arm it receives a branch formed by radicles from the ball of the thumb; and also another from the median venous plexus which lies over the annular ligament; then ascending, it receives branches from the outer and back part of the fore-arm, and, reaching the bend of the elbow, it lies between the tendon of the biceps and the inner edge of the supinator longus, then passes upwards along the outer side ot the arm, at first between the biceps and triceps, then in a sulcus between the deltoid and pectoral, and arching downwards inferior to the clavicle, and over the lesser pectoral, it pierces the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, opening into the axillary vein, immediately prior to its termination receiving a branch from the external jugu- lar which passes over, sometimes under, the clavicle; this vein resembles the saphena in the lower extremity. Basilic Vein arises by a large branch from the in- ternal extremity of the dorsal venous arch, of which it appears the more direct efferent vessel (vena Salvatella), then winds forwards over the ulnar extensor, about the middle of the fore-arm being joined by the cutaneous ulnar vein, then ascending over the cutaneous aspect of the pronator radii teres, and running on the inner side of the arm, it pierces the brachial lascia, and ter- minates by being joined by the vena^ comites to consti- tute the common brachial vein. â€¢ j . Median Vein commences from a plexus situated over

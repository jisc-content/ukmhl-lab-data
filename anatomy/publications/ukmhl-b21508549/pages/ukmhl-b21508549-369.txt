MUSCLES OF THE HAND. 359 between the metacarpal bones it sends a process on the lumbricales tendons, which separates them from the interossei, and immediately posterior to this is pierced by the reinforcing branches of the deep palmar arch of arteries, then becoming continuous at the sides of the phalanges with the superficial palmar fascia. It follows that these represent a glove containing in the cavity the flexor tendons and the lumbricales, each with a sheath derived from the superficial surface of the deep layer, also the superficial palmar arteries and nerves, and carpal bursa; the digital sheaths represent the fingers, and the intervals between them transmit the lumbricales and digital vessels and nerves. Its use is to preserve the position of the interossei; and further, to avert dis- placement of the metacarpal bones; its density explains the fact that matter cannot escape between the inter- ossei when situated in the palm of the hand, which it might otherwise do in the interval between the two sets of these muscles; this we describe as a distinct structure, conceiving its surgical importance to be as great as the superficial layer. Separate now the anterior extremities of the meta- carpal bones by a slight cut, and tear them asunder; the interossei are four behind, and a similar number in front, the former being the dorsal, the latter the palmar; but in both situations, to include four, the adductor poUicis in front, with the abductor indicis behind, must be considered as interossei; these have been described with the muscles of the thumb in a former section. Posterior Interossei.—These are bicipital muscles, and arise between the metacarpal bones of the four outer fingers; they spring by one side from the poste- rior and outer edge of the external and all the internal surface of the inner metacarpal bone, pass forwards, terminate in a tendon at the metacarpo-pharyngeal articulation, and are inserted, the two outer into the radial side of the first phalanx of the index and middle fingers, and also into the extensor tendons on the dor- sal aspect; the two internal into the ulnar side of the middle and ring fingers and extensor tendons. Use.—Ho adduct the fingers to a supposed mesian line, corresponding to the middle finger.

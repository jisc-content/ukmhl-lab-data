I PERITONEUM. 535 right side, we may observe the descending layer of the transverse mesocolon sweeping over the bifurcation of the aorta, meeting with the rectum, which it completely envelops for its upper third,—the meso-rectum; but as it sinks into the pelvis it gradually abandons this viscus, covering in the sides and front only of its middle third, and ultimately the latter part alone, from which it is reflected on the under and back part of the bladder; leaving a deep depression between it and the rectum,— the recto-vesical poiich. Ascending now over the pos- terior surface of the bladder, it invests it for about one- third of its entire extent, till it arrives at its superior fundus. Here it meets with the urachus and obliterated hypogastric arteries, and, guided upwards by these along the anterior Avail of the abdomen, it gains the umbilicus, the point from which it was originally commenced. The peritoneum, which we have just described, forms ligaments for the liver, bladder, and uterus, which will be more properly described in the separate review of each of those viscera, and we will, therefore, for the present confine ourselves to the consideration of the several pro- cesses which it constitutes as it pursues its intricate course through the abdominal cavity. Gastro-hepatic or Lesser Omentum This essen- tially consists of a double fold, but separated from each other by the ductus communis choledochiis, vena portee, hepatic artery, with branches of the pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves. The formation of this" process is accounted for in the following manner. The layer of serous membrane reflected from the diaphragm, on the upper surface of the liver, around its anterior edge to Its under surface, is arrested in its further progress, on reachmg its transverse fissure, by the parts entering and leaving it. Inflected round them externally a large fold IS thrust in behind the stomach, covering in its posterior surface, and, descending, forms the posterior layer of the great omentum. Turning upwards now, it constitutes the anterior part of the transverse colon, which, on reaching the spine, ascends over the posterior wall of the abdomen as far as the liver, which it covers behind the transverse fissure, thus forming a continuous pouch or sac within the great sac of the peritoneum its

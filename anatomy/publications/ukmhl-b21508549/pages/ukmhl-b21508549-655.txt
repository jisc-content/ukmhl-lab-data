MEDULLA OBLONGATA. 645 curving backwards and outwards, as the inferior crura cerebelh, they enter the cerebellum, forming its diverg- ing fibres. The restiform bodies are bounded anteriorly by the respiratory tract, and as they diverge in their as- cent towards the nodus cerebri, the posterior pyramids with the calamus scriptorius, and the median fissure (posterior), become evident between them Posterior Pyramids.—Two small bands' of Avhite me- duUary substance on the posterior surface of the medulla separated from the restiform bodies by a superficial, and from each other by the posterior median sulcus: they are about one-eighth of an inch in width, and are formed by the posterior and a part of the lateral columns of the cord; the latter decussating like the fibres of the ante- rior pyramids. These bodies are then continued upwards passing through the pons, crura cerebri, and optic tha- lami, and from thence to the convolutions of the brain Calamus ScRiPTORius._The posterior surface of the medulla, which is concealed by the cerebellum, appears to open out or become everted, so that the central o-rey matter IS exposed; and as the posterior columns sepa- rate in their ascent, a triangular interval occurs between them, with Its apex inferiorly, which, from its resem- blance to a writing-pen, has been named the calamus : scnptorius. The shaft of the pen is formed by the me- nnw ''i 'r' '''^ f^'*" ^^''^ medullary lines passing upwards, forwards, and outwards, varying in numbef ^ and size, some terminating, after a short cLrse on the . mferior wall of the fourth ventricle, whilst the greater ! number are continuous with the origin of the^portio .mollis nerve. The point of the pen is formed Tt the -angle of separation of the posterior calamus, a mal fos! -sett^ being situated at this point, into which a biSt e can be passed for about a quarter of an inch, but no SnheT Sections of the Medulla.—K a tran^vp, ! ^^^t^er. made immediately below the pyr'amiTs Thrg~ter .rri'^^tr^ ^ts arrangement to that in thel nal third of the pyramids, the grey matter appears irre'u- •larly diffused through the two posterior thirds ofthp -segment; and lastly, a section opposite the centre of h^ -Wy bodies will display, in Addition to the cen^^^^^^^

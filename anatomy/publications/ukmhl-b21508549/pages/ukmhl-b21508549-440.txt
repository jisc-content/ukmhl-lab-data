430 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. the posterior reflection of the base of the ligament which lies below the levator ani, as that muscle separates the two portions of fascia from each other. Ihis por- tion of the canal is fixed and unalterable in its position, and with the exception of the inlet and outlet is the most contracted division of the urethra. It is peculiar in structure; from within outwards there is, first the mucous membrane, pale and fine, almost devoid of la- cuna and intimately adherent to the subjacent struc- ture, which is dense and fibrous, but dimimshmg m density and thickness towards the apex of the prostate; again, external to this, a spongy venous structure is rnoulded on its surface; and lastly, between the layers of the triangular ligament, a fibro-muscular ring, va- riously developed in difi-erent cases, whilst the intrapel- vic portion obtains as a substitute the posterior reflec- tion of the triangular ligament. Between the lower aspect and the rectum a triangular space ^^I'^^^l ^^' fore described, about an inch from the verge of the anus where Mr. Guthrie advises the urethra to be opened in impermeable stricture, an operation which in its facility displays the advantage of connecting anatomy with operative surgery.

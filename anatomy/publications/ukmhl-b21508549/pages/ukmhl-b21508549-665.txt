CEREBRAL NERVES. 655 will subsequently be traced in the description of the plexuses, but it may perhaps be necessary to observe here that the origin of the posterior nerves is much nearer the corresponding median furrow than the ante- rior, the former being also more intimately connected with the structure in front of its own proper fissure. In the earlier periods of intra-uterine life the spinal marrow consists of merely a thin, transparent, pulpy mass, extending the entire length of the spinal canal, and being relatively much larger than the brain; it af- terwards assumes a laminated appearance, which, bend- ing backwards on itself, forms a complete canal, which is continuous with the cavity of the fourth ventricle; but the dense pia mater pressing upon it about its cen- tre, from before backwards, causes the approximation of Its anterior and posterior walls, by which it is con- verted into two distinct tubules. This condition con- tmues to about the sixth month, when the canals be- come obliterated by new deposits, which are gradually added to their inclosing tissues; but still the parts have not as yet assumed a perfectly consolidated character, as the slightest inflation will again produce the re-appear- ance of those cavities. At this period of life the white raatter which invests the cord is extremely thin, and the posterior columns are remarkable for their greater degree of development, and firmer as contrasted with the anterior. It should be also recollected that in foetal life the cord extended the entire length of the canal- but in consequence of the rapid elongation of the cer- vical region it is carried upwards, the filum terminale remaining as the vestige of its sacral portion. The Cerebral Nerves consist of nine pairs, and are divided into motor, sensitive, compound, and nerves of special sense. Taking them in order from before back- wards, it will be found that the first pair are the olfac- tory; the second, optic; the third, motores oculorum; the fourth or trochleatores; the fifth or trifacial, or trige- mmi; the sixth or abducentes; the seventh, consisting o auditory and facial; the eighth, of the pneumo-astric glosso-pharyngeal, and the spinal accessory; and the ninth lingual or the hypo-glossal. Of these, the third tourth, one portion of the fifth, sixth, portio dura of

808 ARTERIES AND VEINS. scalenus; behind, by the posterior; and below, by the first rib, when it enters the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, where its relations are the following:—An- teriorly, integuments, platysma, external jugular vein, transversalis humeri artery, supraclavicular branches of cervical plexus, two layers of fascia, and a quantity of loose areolar tissue, with subclavian branch of brachial plexus; posteriorly, posterior scalenus and first nb; externally and superiorly, brachial plexus; and infe- riorly and anteriorly, its own vein. The left subclavian in its first stage is nearly vertical, and it has anterior to it the same parts as the right, with the addition of the formation of the left vena innomi- nata, lung, pleura, cartilage of first rib, and clavicle; pos- terior to it the longus colli, with which it is in immediate contact, and at its commencement, the thoracic duct, which is a little internal to it, and sympathetic nerve; externally, the left lung and pleura; internally, oesopha- gus, and internally and anteriorly, left carotid, pueumo- gastric, and phrenic nerves. In its second stage it is si- milar to the right, only that it is crossed by the thoracic duct, which winds over it on the edge of the scalenus to join the subclavian vein. Eemarks.—The difference in length between the two subclavian arteries is greater than what is generally supposed, and it has been found on accurate measure- ment that the left is somewhat longer than the com- pound trunk of the right and arteria innommata; the former likewise being much more deeply situated than the latter, the one being a little more than an inch from the surface at its origin, and the other half-an-mch. From the curved direction of those vessels, and the com- paratively straight course of their correspondmg veins, which always lie on a plain anterior and interior to them, they may be very aptly compared to arcs of a circle, constituted by the artery, to which the veins form the subtending chords. In their first stages both vessels are surrounded by a nervous loop from the sympathetic (annulus of Vieusseus). Anomalies.—It may arise separately from the arch, either from the right or left extremity of the transverse portion, or even from the descending. Ihere may be

244 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. following covering, the temporal fascia, zygoma, and masseter. To examine the deep relations, saw across the zygoma, and carefully dissect down the muscle from above; it will then be seen to lie on the bone, the deep temporal vessels and nerves, a deep layer of fascia, ex- ternal pterygoid, from which it is separated by the in- ternal maxillary artery; also on the buccinator, with the intervention of a large quantity of fat, that like- wise separates it from the pterygo-maxillary ligament. It may now be observed, that the greater portion of the fleshy fibres are situated on the internal side of the ten- don, where they are continued nearly to the upper third of the ramus of the jaw, but the external terminate above the coronoid process. A bursa is interposed be- tween the posterior fibres and the trochlea of the zygo- ma; the middle temporal artery and the temporal branch of the superior maxillary nerve piercing the fleshy fibres of the muscle. Action To elevate the lower jaw, by acting on the vertical ramus from behind, as on a bell-crank. It is thought that the anterior and posterior fibres will draw the bone in their respective directions, and that the posterior antagonize the external pterygoid and avert dislocation. We believe, however, that it can only act in its totality as an elevator in simple vertical move- ments,—a circumstance rendered more probable by its greater development in the carnivora. Its contractile energy must be subject to much variation, as it is often seen pale and weak, with a great predominance of the tendinous over the fleshy structure; but the thickness of the muscle cannot be estimated correctly from ex- ternal appearances,—for in those subjects where the temporal region, before dissection, presented a marked concavity, w"e have found the muscle above the average thickness, this appearing to depend on the depth ot the bony fossa rather than on the superficial structures. At this stage of the dissection, the brain should be removed for future examination; but the dura mater sinuses, and orbit, may now be dissected with much advant;ge, for which see Anatomy of the Nervous ^^The^PTERYGOiD Muscles are situated deep beneath

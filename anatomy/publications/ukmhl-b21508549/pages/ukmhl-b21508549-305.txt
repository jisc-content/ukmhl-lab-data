This cartilage is much denser and heavier than the thyroid; by its great height posteriorly it compensates for the deficiency of the thyroid in that direction; it forms the basis of the tube, and the most active of the laryngeal muscles are attached to it as their fixed point. Ossific changes oc- cur at a later period than in the thyroid, and are prin- cipally found in the situation of the origin of the crico- thyroid muscle; and in the median vertical ridges, pos- teriorly and laterally, the cavity is somewhat larger than the first ring of the trachea, so that it receives it in the quiescent state. In some rare instances the lower edge is fused with that ring, but a circular indentation always marks their division. Arytenoid Cartilages Two in number, of a tri- angular figure, the base below resting on the cricoid; the apex above surmounted by the cornicula; the base presents an oblique concavity, which articulates with the cricoid; the apex is curved backwards, sometimes united immoveably with the cornicula, or more fre- quently an articulation occurs between them. Of the three suri'aces, one is external; the second, internal; and the third, posterior and superior. The external edge looks forwards and outwards, and gives attachment to the crico-arytenoideus lateralis and mucous membrane, which here contains numerous glands, called arytenoid; this edge at the base is prolonged into a projecting cornu, passing backwards and outwards, into which the crico-arytenoideus posticus is inserted. The inner sur- face looks towards its fellow, and gives origin to the transverse arytenoid muscles. The anterior edge is feebly marked above, more apparent below; it gives at- tachment from above downwards to the aryteno-epiglot- tidean folds and muscles, superior vocal chord, thyro-

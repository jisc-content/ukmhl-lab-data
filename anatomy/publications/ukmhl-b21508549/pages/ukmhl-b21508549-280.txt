270 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. into three sets: four or five open on a fold at the in- ferior and lateral part of the tongue; three to seven on the sublingual space behind the inferior canine teeth; and five or six unite to form a single tube, which either iinites with or more frequently follows the course of the Whartonian duct, opening external to it on the mucous membrane of the sublingual space; the amount of the secretion of both glands is about two ounces in twenty- four hours; the nervous stipply is derived from the gustatory nerve, and the vascular from the sublingual branch of the lingual artery. The Styloid Muscles should now be examined, but in doing so avoid injuring the carotids or their branches; these muscles are three in number,—stylo-hyoid, glos- sus, and pharyngeus. Stylo-hyoid.—A narrow fleshy fasciculus, arises by a round tendon from the outer side of the styloid pro- cess, about its centre; this tendon winds at first back- wards and outwards, then turns forwards so as to surround two-thirds of the external carotid; it then becomes fleshy, is pierced by the tendon of the digastric, and continues its course to be inserted into the body of the OS hyoides, superficial to the hyo-glossus. Relations It lies on the styloid process, the external and internal carotids, jugular vein, pneumogastric and sympathetic nerves, partly on the digastric, lingual nerve and artery with the facial and the hyo-glossus; it is covered at its origin by the external carotid, facial vein, submaxillary gland, also at the os hyoides, by a few fibres of the mylo-hyoid. This muscle is very rarely absent; the stylo-hyoid branch of the portio dura supplies it. Action To draw the os hyoides, larynx, and pha- rynx upwards and backwards; it cannot act independent of the digastric. Stylo-glossus.—Arises tendinous from the anterior and internal part of the styloid process, from its centre to its point; also from the stylo-maxillary ligament; it passes obliquely forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the side of the tongue, external to the hyo-glossus, extending as far as the apex, there uniting with its fellow to form a loop.

392 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. nia when the canal connecting it with the abdomen is still pervious. A portion of intestine may then esca,pe and lie within its cavity, constituting congenital hernia; but if subsequent to birth, when the canal is being obliterated at the internal ring, by plastic lymph, a portion of intestine escapes, carrying the yielding exu- dation before it, as an expanded covering into the ca- vity of the tunic; this constitutes " infantile hernia" of Hey. Within the tunica vaginalis small cartilaginous bodies are frequently found, perfectly detached and free, but always in the vicinity of the epididymis, these being observed in cases without a trace of any struc- tural change. The Testicles are two in number, but as before mentioned, one may be retained in the abdomen, canal, or ring. Instances are mentioned where these organs exceeded the natural number, but any cases merely examined through the coverings of the scrotum are scarcely worthy of credit, as many circumstances con- duce to mistakes, as a portion of omentum in the vagi- nal tunic, or scrofulous and hydatid tumours m the gland. In a subject dissected last session, prior to opening the sac there was every reason to suspect a su- pernumerary organ, but it proved to be a very interest- ing anomaly,â€”the epididymis being placed on the ante- rior part of the testicle, the usual anterior edge being di- rected backwards. Each testicle is ovoid m figure, a little larger below, placed obliquely m the scrotum, diverging above, the posterior edge looking upwards and backwards, the anterior downwards and forwards; its vertical measurement from one and a half to two inches, from one inch to one and a half antero-poste- riorly, and from three-quarters to an inch transversely; these probably are a little in excess. The left testicle is always much inferior to the right, and Sir A. Cooper believes that this position facilitates their gliding move- ments in eluding pressure, and allowing the penis to proiect towards the left side, instead of directly ior- wards; it is also accounted for by the left spermatic vein opening into the renal, which again crosses the aorta, so that a resistance is afforded to the ascent of the venous blood from the left testicle, but the real cause

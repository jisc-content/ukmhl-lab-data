545 DUODENUM. or perpendicular. Of these the superior transverse is the shortest, being not more than two inches, passing obhquely from the pylorus upwards, backwards, and towards the right side, to terminate at the liver, which it slightly grooves a little external to the gall bladder. At this point the vertical commences; its course is nearly perpendicularly downwards as far as opposite the third lumbar vertebra, in length scarcely reaching three inches. The inferior transverse extends from the termination of the preceding, upwards, forwards, and towards the left side, crossing the spinal column opposite the second lum- bar where the jejunum commences, and is about four inches in extent. If we now proceed to examine the relations of each separately, we will find them to be very complicated. The superior transverse portion rests upon the right crus of the diaphragm and psoas muscle, the portal and caval veins, gastro-duodenalis artery, ductus communis choledochus, and sympathetic nerve; above, it has the right lobe of the liver, foramen of Winslow, and gall bladder, with the exudation from which it is always partially stained; in front, the hepatic flexure of colon and gastro-colic omentum; and below it, the upper edge of the pancreas and gastro-duodenalis, dividing into gastro-epiploica dextra and pancreatico-duodenalis ar- teries. The vertical portion rests in its descent on the kidney and cava, but the latter is rather internal to it; in front of it is the ascending portion of the colon, lying anterior and external to it; the pancreas is to its inner side, but is separated from it by its own as well as the common bile duct and pancreatico-duodenalis artery, and externally is the abdominal wall. Inferior trans- verse has behind it the quadratus lumborum, psoas, and right crus of the diaphragm, ureter, vena cava, sympa- thetic nerve, and aorta, from which it is separated by the left renal vein; anterior to it is the splitting of the transverse mesocolon, stomach, and superior mesenteric artery; above it, the pancreas; and below it, the attach- ment of the root of the mesentery. From the tortuosity of this portion of the gut it ne- cessarily follows that it must partially occupy several regions of the abdominal cavity, and we accordingly find It in the epigastric, right hypochondriac, lumbar, and I

MUSCLES OF THE LEG. 479 and, expanding a little, is inserted into the posterior and inferior part of the os calcis, constituting, with the ten- don of the soleus, the tendo Achillis. delations—The external head lies on the femur, the tendon of the poplitsus, and the prolongation of the sy- novial membrane connected with that tendon; also on the ligamentum posticum of Winslow, external inferior articular artery, some fibres of the plantaris, and the tibio- fibular articulation, with the outer head of the soleus; its outer edge corresponds to biceps tendon, from which it is separated by the peroneal nerve; the inner to the popli- teal space and its contents; the posterior surface is sub- fascial. The internal head, much longer, lies on the femur, on a large bursa which sometimes communicates with the joint, ligament of Winslow, internal inferior artery, and poplitseus; the outer edge corresponds to the popliteal space and its contents, the inner to the semitendinosus and semimembranosus tendons. More internally the posterior surface is subfascial; the fleshy belly is convex behind, and is covered by the skin, with two layers of fascia and the posterior saphenous vein and nerve. It lies on the solasus and plantaris; the outer edge corresponds to the peroneus longus and bre- vis, the inner to the internal saphenous vein and nerve. The tendo Achillis stands out prominently, and lies on the deep fascia; externally it is bordered by the poste- rior saphenous vein and nerve, and the inner edge serves as a guide to cutting down on the posterior tibial ar- tery in the inferior third of the leg. It is separated trom the os calcis above by a bursa, and is also covered posteriorly by fat, beneath which a bursa often exists. Ihe popliteal space separates the two heads superiorly _ Action.—Thisis the most powerful muscle in the body in consequence of its being inserted at right angles to the lever on which it acts; it flexes the knee-joint, and serves the purpose of an active ligament, by preventing the tibia slipping backwards; it also extends the ankle- joint, as m progression, when it represents a lever of the second order in action, the fulcrum being at the toes, the power at the insertion of the tendon, and the weight transmitted through the tibia to the astragalus

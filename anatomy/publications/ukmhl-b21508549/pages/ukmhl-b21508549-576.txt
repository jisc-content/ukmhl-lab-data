566 CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. it completely except its posterior border, the groove for the gall bladder, over which it is reflected, the great fissures, and the small spaces between the ligaments. The extensive surface of serous membrane which is thus afforded has naturally a tendency to facilitate those mo- tions to which the organ is subjected in the alternating movements of inspiration and expiration, which it must necessarily follow from its attachment to the diaphragm. The proper fibrous capsule was first described by Glis- son, who conceived it to be muscular, and it is best ob- served on those parts of the liver where the serous coat is deficient. It is thin, but strong, and cannot be de- tached for any extent from the hepatic structure, ow- ing to processes which are very freely sent into it at all points. On arriving at the transverse fissure, it forms complete tubules or sheaths around the several vessels and ducts as they enter at the same point, and is ulti- mately expended in constituting investing capsules for the small lobules of which the organ is composed, be- ing in this position very thin, but vascular, from the numerous filaments of the hepatic artery which ramify on its surface. Even in the human liver the lobules are large enough to be detected with the naked eye, but present a diff"erent aspect according as they are cut in the vertical or transverse direction, being in the former in- stance leaf-shaped, the margin not presenting, however, an uniform appearance, while in the latter they are poly- hedral, having sometimes four, five, or six angles. Each lobule is enclosed in a process of the capsule, which em- braces it completely, except at its base, where it is de- ficient, and where it rests on a small vein,â€”the sublobu- lar; they do not lie exactly in contact Avith each other, but narrow intervals are left between their contiguous margins (interlobular fissures), but when more than two are in juxtaposition, this interval is increased in size (in- terlobular space). A lobule consists of a series of gra- nular cells, interspersed with branches from the portal and hepatic veins, hepatic artery, and according to some the hepatic ducts; these must be now severally ex- amined.

798 ARTERIES AND VEINS. Spheno-palatine.—This, both from its size and di- rection, ought to be considered as the continuation ol the internal maxillary; it proceeds directly inwards through the spheno-palatine hole into the posterior part of the superior meatus, and divides into a network of branches which supplies the spongy bones, one or two long filaments always accompanying the nerve ot <.o- tunnius to the incisive fossa to anastomose with the posterior palatine. _ . , Infra-orbital.—Variableinsize;itpasses forwards crossing the spheno-maxillary fossa, through which i sends up numerous twigs, for the supply of the fa and muscles of the orbit, and before it emerges through the infra-orbital hole, it gives off filaments to the anterior part of the antrum. On the face it lies between the fevator anguli oris and outer head of the leva or labu superioris°ala.que nasi, and here divides into three sets of branches,-internal, middle, and external: the firs proceeding towards the nose and anastomos ng with the S the'second passmg upwards to the - e-or ^yf ^ and uniting with the proper palpebral, while the third runs outwfrds towards the malar bone, to communicate with the transverse facial. , -A^r-^A BemarJcs.-The internal maxillary - J-J^^-^f^/^^^^ one of the most difficult of the branches of the external carotid, this difficulty depending not only on its tor- uous bourse and nuLrous -Pf-^t^^^^;' likewise on an irregularity to which it ^ stantlv liable.

275 PHARYNX. strong in tliis situation. When this is removed the fibres are seen, but the several origins require for their exposition a more definite description of each. Inferior Constrictor.â€”The origin is exposed by- throwing up the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, and then removing the lateral lobe of the thyroid body; it is somewhat square, the upper and lower edges being oblique, the posterior straight, and the anterior irregu- lar ; it arises from an obliqu.eline on the ala of the thyroid cartilage, between the sterno-thyroid and crico-thyroidin front, and the insertion of the stylo-pharyngeus behind ; also from the inferior cornu of the same cartilage, and from a ridge on the cricoid, between the crico-thyroid and crico-arytenoideus posticus, sometimes from the first ring of the trachea or thyroid body, and more rarely by a slip from the superior and posterior edge of the cricoid cartilage, which, when it exists, is connected with the proper arytenoid muscles; from these points of origin the fibres pass upwards and backwards, and are inserted into a central tendinous raphe, extending from the cuneiform process to the oesophagus on the posterior surface of the pharynx; the lower margin embraces the oesophagus, and behind the cricoid origin, the inferior laryngeal nerve and the inferior laryngeal branch of the thyroid glide between it and the oesophagus; the upper margin overlaps the middle constrictor, and be- tween their origins are found the superior laryngeal nerve and artery, and the superior cornu of the thy- roid cartilage; in this space may likewise be observed the thyro-hyoid ligament and the insertion of the sty- lo-pharyngeus muscle. Now divide the inferior constric- tor in the middle line, reflecting it forwards towards the thyroid cartilage, when the peculiarity of its origin may be seen; this consists of three arches, the first extends from a tubercle in front of the superior cornu to a se- cond inferiorly, at the j unction of the posterior with the middle third of the ala of the thyroid; a tendinous band intervenes between them; it is next attached to the in- ferior cornu on the external surface, sometimes a little anterior to it, thus forming a second arch smaller than the former, beneath which the crico-thyroid muscle passes to its insertion; lastly, a third arch is formed be- tween the last attachment and the cricoid origin; the cri-

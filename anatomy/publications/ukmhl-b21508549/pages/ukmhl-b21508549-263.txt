253 PAROTID GLAND. nally and anteriorly by the stylo-maxillary ligament and styloid process; on raising it from its deep relations the external carotid is seen perforating the stylo-maxil- lary ligament, and then enters the gland. If the finger be now passed deep into the space, the internal carotid may be felt, also the styloid process; but although the glandular structure lies over the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, the eighth, ninth, and sympathe- tic nerves, it never can be in contact with them, as there does not exist any opening in the capsule, at any part of its deep surface, to allow the gland to reach the ves- sels above-mentioned. This portion contains generally three lymphatic glands, sometimes only one; these are subject to chronic enlargement, and coincident with that change a consequent absorption of the parotid structure. Let attention now be directed to the parts lying in the gland: on the surface is seen the auricu- laris magnus nerve, a branch of the cervical plexus, ascending on the fascia, and dividing into an auricular and facial branch, which are both tegumentary; descend- ing in front of the tragus, on the horizontal root of the zy- goma is seen the temporal vein, lying superficial and anterior to its corresponding artery,—this is formed above the zygomatic arch by the confluence of the an- terior middle and posterior temporal veins; it then re- ceives the transverse facial, and becomes the temporo- facial vein ; about half-an-inch below the condyle of the lower jaw it is joined by the internal maxillary vein, and then receives the name of temporo-maxillary; accompanying the external carotid in the gland, separated from that vessel, however, by the portio dura, at the angle of the jaw it receives the posterior auris, and sometimes the occipital, and then becomes external ju- gular in the inferior lobe of the gland. Now dissect deeply in front of the mastoid process, and the portio dura will be seen passing at first downwards, then turning forwards and upwards, deep behind, but super- ficial at its exit from the gland; between the gland and the stylo-mastoid foramen it gives off three small fila- ' ments,—posterior auricular to the ear, digastric branch to the muscle of that name, and stylo-hyoid branch, named from its destination to that muscle; it then

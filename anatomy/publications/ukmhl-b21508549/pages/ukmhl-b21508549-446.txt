436 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. by the junction of Burns's ligament with the pubic di- vision—the concavity being directed upwards, and the edge prolonged backwards on the saphena vein to be- conie continuous with the sheath of the femoral vessels; but when the vein is raised from its position, the han- dle of the scalpel can be passed between the saphenic opening and the sheathof the vessels for about two lines, showing that the reflection is exceedingly weak. Ihe pubic portion is thinner than the last, and lies on a plane posterior to it, attached to the rami ot the ischium and pubis, to the symphisis and linea ileo-pectmea, where it becomes continuous with the iliac fascia, correspond- in- to the falciform process; the external edge passes outwards beneath the femoral vessels, which should be removed to see it, and at the margin of the psoas splits into two layers, one of which passes m front of that muscle, and is continuous with the fascia iliaca, forming the posterior part of the sheath of the vessels; the pos- terior passes behind the psoas tendon, and is attached to the capsule of the hip-joint, covermg the bursa m that situation; at the saphenic opening it does not split but at that point, or fourteen lines below Poupart s liga- ment itToins the iliac division. The cribriform portion occupies the central position between the two former, covering the saphenic opening, in structure being weak cellular and f^tty, and continued upwards as Scarpa s Wr on the abdomen, the superficial surface being blended with the subcutaneous layer; the superficial branches of the femoral artery and short saphenous nerve ogether with the internal saphena vein, pierce ?n their course, and from this the name cribri orm is de- r ved It can easily be raised from the pubic portion but wben an attempt is made to detach it from the iliac division, a direct continuity is observed between hem a circumstance which did not escape the o^se ; ^^j^ the late Mr. Colles; any separation or definition ol the falciform process is therefore on y arbitrary In fat sub jects it is thick and loaded with adeps, but nj^l e t^ •and emaciated it partakes of the f ^° the iliac portion, being loosely attached to he skm but intimately to the sheath of the femoral vessels which lie beneath it.

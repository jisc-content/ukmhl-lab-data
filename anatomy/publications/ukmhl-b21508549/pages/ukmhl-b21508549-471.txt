461 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. Semimembranosus.—Tendinous and aponeurotic above and below, fleshy in the centre, lying beneath the last; it arises by a strong flat tendon, from the upper and outer part of the tuber ischii, deeper than the biceps and semitendinosus; the tendon then expands, becomino- aponeurotic, and on the inner oblique margin the fleshy fibres commence; a thick fleshy belly succeeds, which after a course of about five inches is attached to the outer margin of an aponeurotic tendon, that, contracting and becoming round, passes behind the inner condyle of the femur, and divides into three processes,—the an- terior, a continuation of the original tendon, curves for- wards, passing deeper than the sartorius and gracilis, and is inserted into a horizontal groove on the inner condyle of the femur; the second, a thick, flat lamina, arises from the posterior and external edge of the ten- don, passes upwards and outwards, beneath the semi- tendinosus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, popliteal artery, vein, and nerve, and is inserted into the internal side of the external condyle of the femur, sending a process over the posterior surface of that point to the sheath of the _ popliteus tendon; the third, a thin, but strong fascial layer, comes off from the lower curved edo-e of the tendon, and, descending on the surface of the popliteus muscle, is inserted into the oblique line of that name, becoming continuous with the deep fascia of the leg. Relations—It is covered'above by the glutseus maxi- mus, semitendinosus, and biceps; also by the fascia; it lies on the quadratus femoris, adductor magnus, and overlaps the inner head of the gastrocnemius; lastly on the tibia, a bursa intervening; the great sciatic nerve lies on its outer side, in its whole course. It has been remarked that the fascia is exceedingly strong, as it invests the posterior surface of the tendons of the semi- tendinosus and membranosus, or the two inner ham- strings; it also sends processes deep into the bone, to invest each in its distinct fibrous tubule; on the external side the outer hamstring or biceps tendon is similarly retamed by a fascial sheath; between the outer and inner hamstrings inferiorly, the upper half of the popli- teal space is situated, but superiorly they are merely

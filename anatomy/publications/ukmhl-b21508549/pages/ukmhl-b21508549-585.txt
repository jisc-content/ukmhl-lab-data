SPLEEN. 575 ordinary condition, except in cases of enlargement, to which it is very liable, when it may either press over to the right side or downwards. In its natural state it weighs from three to seven or eight ounces, and is simi- lar in figure to an ellipse divided longitudinally; it accordingly presents for examination an internal and external surface, and a circumference. The external surface is convex, and lies in contact with the cartilages of the four inferior ribs, from which, however, it is sepa- rated by the fleshy fibres of the diaphragm; the internal is concave, presenting nearly in the centre a deep de- pression, known as the hylus, through which the arte- ries enter for its supply; it is in relation with the great ' extremity of the stomach, splenic vessels, and vasa bre- via, gastro-splenic omentum, tail of pancreas, supra- ; renal capsule, and occasionally with the left lobe of the 1 liver; Its superior edge corresponds to the diaphracrm 1 Its posterior to the left kidney, its inferior to the ancrle ^ of the colon, and its anterior to the stomach. It is 1 kept in position by a layer of peritoneum from the dia- ;phragm, by another from the large end of the stomach (gastro-splenic omentum), as well as by its own arteries ;and the pressure of the adjacent parts. The spleen, like the liver, has only two coats, an ex- (ternal serous and an internal fibrous. The former in- vests It completely, except at the hylus, where it is ' deficient for the passage of the vessels for its supply conferring on it a smooth surface externally, which per- rmits It to glide with facility, and accommodate itself to • those changes of position to which it is so constantly liable from the condition of the stomach, whether dis- ttended or otherwise, to which it is connected. This •tunic IS closely adherent to the fibrous, from which, it can with difficulty be detached Fibrous Coat. This is thin, transparent, but strong, .and IS not only closely united to the peritoneal, but ■ likewise to the spleen itself, into which it sends innu- rmerable prolongations, which interlace with each other 1 in every possible manner, converting the entire organ iinto a series of cells, which appear to communicate with •each other only in certain proportions, and not com- ipletely. On arriving at the hylus it does not terminate

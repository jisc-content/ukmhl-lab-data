SMALL INTESTINE. 549 most dilatation which can be employed without rup- turing the intestine will never perfectly obliterate them; besides, their direction, which is transverse, is a strong argument against such a supposition. It would, therefore, appear more probable that their object is to retard the food in its passage, and by delaying its too rapid transit, to subject it to the action of the absor- bents, a more extended surface for which is admirably obtained by this beautiful arrangement. The mucous membrane in the upper part of the small intestine is much thicker and more vascular than in its lower, but in its whole course it is only loosely connected to the subjacent fibrous tunic by fine areolar tissue. Glands—In the superior transverse, as well as in the upper part of the vertical portion of the duodenum, a series of granular bodies may be observed, about the size of a small grain of shot, flattened out, of a pinkish grey colour, and situated in the submucous tissue, being very numerous at first, and closely impacted to- gether, but becoming more scattered as they descend They were first described by Brunner, and have since been called after the name of that anatomist. They appear to be identical in structure with the salivary glands, and they pour their secretion on the mucous membrane, each by a single duct, but with respect to the nature of the fluid which they elaborate, or its uses in the animal economy, nothing is distinctly known. Solitary Glands—These are found not only in'the small, but likewise in the large intestine, and they ap- pear to increase in number, according as they descend through the alimentary tube. They may be regarded as closed saccules, being about the size of a millet seed flattened out, oval in shape, in colour white, and con- taming when laid open a kind of fibrinous fluid inter- mixed with granular cells. It is a disputed point whe- ther they have any distinct orifice opening on the gut but the highest authorities argue that they have not' and entertain the opinion that the foramina or depres- sions visible occasionally on these surfaces and around their margins (crypts of Lieberkuhn), are caical, and do not communicate with the cavity of the vesicle It IS therefore supposed that the fluid, having accumulated

784 ARTERIES AND VEINS. one inch and a half, has the following thoracic rela- tions:—Anteriorly, first bone of sternum, origins ot sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, deep cervical tascia, remains of thymus gland and left vena innommata; pos- teriorly, trachea, esophagus, and thoracic duct; exter- nally, pneumogastric and phrenic nerves, and tormation of left vena innominata; externally and posteriorly, lelt subclavian; and internally, arteriainnominata with the triangular interval, containing trachea and inferior thy- roid veins. -, , i • Remarks.—^o\\i the carotids and subclavians on the left side, although longer in their course, are smaller in caliber than those on the right, a fact, according to Bi- chat, resulting from the more frequent use ot the latter side of the body. It should be borne m mmd that the carotids, although comparatively near to each other at their origin, gradually diverge as they ascend, so that a considerable interval exists between them at their ter- mination; the left is also nearer the mesian line, and is more closely related both to the oesophagus and its corresponding pneumogastric nerve. A f invests the artery, vein, and nerve, on both sides, but the two last are always in closer connexion with each other than the nerve to'the artery. We have in the general description stated the point where these arteries usually terminate, but it should be recollected that cases fre- quently occur where it may bifurcate either above or below the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, but it is a general rule that its division into external and mter- naf carotids is always nearer the angle of tl^e jaw inthe adult than in the very young or very old, the ob vious reason of the non-development of the angle at tho e periods of life.

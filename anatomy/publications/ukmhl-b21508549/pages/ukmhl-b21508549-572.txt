CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 562 This surface corresponds anteriorly and to the right side to the gall bladder, angle of duodenum and colon, suprarenal capsule and right kidney, gastro-hepatic omentum, with the parts separating its layers, hepatic artery, which embraces its Spigelian lobe, which, with the foramen of Winslow, divide it from the pancreas and anterior surface of stomach. The posterior margin is exceedingly thick, and intercepted by two depres- sions, the larger lying between the left and right lobes, deep and broad, corresponding to the vertebral column, aorta, and crura of the diaphragm; the smaller is occupied by the ascending cava, while in the remainder of its ex- tent it corresponds to the diaphragm. Its anterior mar- gin is thin, presenting the notch already alluded to for the insertion of the ligamentum teres; it is in relation with the cartilages of the ribs, but in motions of respi- ration usually descends below them for about half-an- inch; its right extremity is very thick, and corresponds to the five or six lower ribs and the indigitations of the transversalis with the diaphragm; its left is thin and sharp, being in contact with the great extremity of the stomach, and sometimes extending so far as to touch the spleen. The liver is retained in position by five ligaments, four of which are merely folds of the peritoneum, and the fifth is the obliterated remains of the umbilical vein. The last takes its origin from the fibrous tissue of the umbilical orifice, to which it is firmly adherent, and passing upwards, and to the right side, is inserted into the notch at the thin margin of the liver. Its use appears to be not so much to suspend the organ as to keep it closely fixed to the abdominal wall; and thus to relieve the stomach of the pressure to which it would be otherwise subjected. Falciform Ligament This is a double fold of peri- toneum, carried down from the abdominal wall to the upper surface of the liver, over which it is afterwards reflected. It is triangular in shape, presenting two margins,â€”an anterior, superior, and posterior inferior, a base and an apex. The anterior superior margin is convex, and attached to the right side of the linea alba; the posterior inferior is concave, and corresponds to the

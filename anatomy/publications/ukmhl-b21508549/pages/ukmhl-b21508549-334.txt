324 THE MUSCULAE SYSTEM. the ilium, to the same extent, will form the steps requi- site to examine the superposition of structures in the lumbar region, the study of which has become of some importance as a practical consideration in connexion with the operations of Callisen and Amussat, for creat- ing an artificial anus in cases of rectal obstruction, and certain classes of congenital malformation. When the in- tegument is raised, the superficial fascia is seen thick and strong behind, being attached in this situation to the lumbar spines; passing forwards, it diminishes in density and thickness, generally assuming the laminated condition peculiar to the abdomen in its structure; the last dorsal nerve and posterior branches of the four first lumbar are here observed to pass downwards and for- wards, to reach the skin of the buttock. When this layer is raised, the tendinous origin of the latissimus dorsi is exposed; this, for all practical purposes, constitutes the posterior layer of the lumbar aponeurosis; it is attached to all the lumbar spines, tubercles on the back of the sacrum, three inferior dorsal spines; and externally to the posterior spinous process of the ilium. If now the latissimus dorsi is divided perpendicularly, and the pos- terior portion reflected backwards, it will appear that the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi can be raised from the proper lumbar fascia to within an inch and a half of the vertebral spines, but behind that point, both the aponeurosis of the inferior serratus and the latissi- mus are inseparably united with the lumbar fascia, the three having a common attachment to the vertebrae; in fact, it seems as if the latissimus arose between the two fibrous layers to which we have alluded. It follows from this description that the posterior leaf of the aponeurosis is strongest where it binds down the erector spinae mus- cles, which in a perfectly developed subject stand out, forming a rounded longitudinal mass on each side of the vertebrse; it must, therefore, serve to retain them in their proper positions during violent contraction or those sudden movements to which the spine subserves; but at the outer margin of this mass the proper lumbar layer alone exists, covered by the fleshy part of the la- tissimus, and fixed by its attachment above to the pos- terior surface of the last rib external to its angle, and

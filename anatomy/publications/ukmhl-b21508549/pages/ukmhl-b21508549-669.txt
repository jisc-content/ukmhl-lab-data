CEREBRAL NERVES. 659 tory and seventh pair. We may here remark that a perfect decussation of the nervous filaments occurs in the chiasma of fishes. Third Pair, or Motores Oculorum White and round, arise from the inner edge of the crus cerebri where it emerges from the pons, but this origin is merely apparent, as the filaments may be traced into the locus niger. It then passes a little backwards and downwards, lying between the anterior cerebellar and posterior ce- rebral arteries, winding round three-fourths of the lat- ter, then passing upwards, forwards, and outwards, in- ternal to the posterior communicating artery, through the fine areolar tissue of the middle subarachnoid space, it lies between the attachment of the convex and con- cave margins of the tentorium, and enters the outer wall of the cavernous sinus, lying above the fourth in the two posterior thirds of that space, but anteriorly that nerve winds round its outer margin to become superior to It. The third nerve now becomes flattened and di- vides into a superior and inferior division, both of which enter the orbit by the sphenoidal fissure, between the two heads of the external rectus; the superior division, the smaller, as it enters the fissure has above it the frontal nerve, and one head of the external rectus, and immediately beneath it the nasal, from which it receives a communicating branch; passing forwards and inwards^ over the nasal and optic nerves, it divides into two branches,—the superior, or the larger, winds round the inner margin of the superior rectus, near its back part and lying on the superior surface of that muscle for a short distance, where it is flattened, sinks into the deep aspect of the levator palpebraj superioris, in which the filaments of the nerve may be traced to the palpebral attachment; while the second, or inferior of the two enters and supplies the ocular surface of the superior rectus muscle. The inferior division of the third nerve entering the foramen lacerum orbitale, between the two heads of the external rectus, lies below the superior aivision and the nasal, and above the sixth nerve, then passing forwards, and lying inferior and external to the optic nerve, it divides into three branches,_external middle, and internal: the first, which is the largest' >

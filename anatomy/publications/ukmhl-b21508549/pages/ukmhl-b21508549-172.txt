THE ANATOMY OF THE JOINTS. 162 back part of the sternum, where it corresponds to the anterior mediastinum and the parts contained in it. SACRO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATION. The union of the spinal column with the sacrum is closely analogous to that of the vertebrse with each other, but is remarkable for the great vertical depth in front of the intervertebral disc, and its shallowness be- hind contributing in a great measure to the production of the prominence which is so observable in front. In addition, however, to the ligaments which it has in common with the spine, it likewise possesses another peculiar to it,'—the sacro-vertebral, a strong fasciculus of fibres, which extends from the transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra, and is inserted into the back part of the base of the sacrum, where it becomes blended with the sacro-iliac ligaments. It is extremely hard to dissect, from the manner in which the ten- dinous origins of the erectors of the spine are blended with it. SACRO-COCCYGEAL ARTICULATION. This is an arthrodial joint in early life, although at a later period it becomes a synarthrosis, the two bones composing it being united by ossific deposit. Its mode of connexion consists of an anterior and posterior liga- ment, and a thin disc of fibro-cartilage. Anterior Sacro-coccygeal Ligament This usu- ally consists of two distinct bands, with a slight inter- val between them, stretching from the anterior surface of the sacrum to the front of the coccyx. To expose it, the rectum must be removed, some loose areolar tis- sue, and coccygeal ganglion of sympathetic. Generally speaking, it is always comparatively weak. Posterior Sacro-coccygeal.—This stretches from the last tubercles on the lower edge of the sacrum to similar processes on the upper part of the coccyx. It is rather stronger than the anterior, and completes the spinal canal below. The glutajus maximus covers and takes an origin from it.

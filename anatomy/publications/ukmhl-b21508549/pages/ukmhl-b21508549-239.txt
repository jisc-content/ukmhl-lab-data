The structures forming the lids, from superficial to deep, are, the skin, areolar tissue, orbicularis, tarsal car- tilage, palpebral ligaments, expansion of the levator palpebra3, and conjunctiva,—the levator being absent in the lower lid; the skin is fine, thin, and smooth, but not very sensitive, transversely rugated both on the upper and lower lids; internally and externally it pre- sents a sulcus parallel with the chiasma; at the margins it becomes continuous with the conjunctiva,—a transi- tion almost imperceptible; the areolar tissue beneath the skin is lax and reticular, permitting with facility the occurrence of serous efi'usion, but at the margins it is dense, so that the skin is very adherent in this situa- tion, but in no single point does it ever present the cha- racter of a fascial covering, accounting in some degree for the separation of the muscular fibres before alluded to. The muscular layer has already been fully described, and on removing it, the palpebral ligaments and tarsal cartilages are seen on the same plane; the fibro-carti- lages, called tarsal, are two, one for each lid,—that for the upper being much the larger and best marked; it is semilunar in figure, presenting two surfaces, two edges, and two cornua; the superficial aspect is covered by the orbicularis and is convex; the deep or concave surface corresponding to the globe of the eye is lined by the conjunctiva and the expansion of the levator palpebrse superioris. A number of vertical but irregular grooves mark the situations of the Meibomian glands; the superior margin is thin, and receives the attachment of the levator palpebras and palpebral ligament; the inferior or ciliary edge is thick, and bevilled in such a direction that when the lids are closed, a triangular canal results, two of its sides being formed by the car- tilages, and the base by the globe of the eye; it has been asserted that this only occurs after death, when the globe has collapsed, but observation proves this I

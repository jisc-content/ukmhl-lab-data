874 ARTERIES AND VEINS. backwards, sometimes double, above Steno's duct, ter- minates in the temporal vein above the internal maxil- lary. Thus, as far as the junction of the internal max- illary, the vein receives the name of temporo-facial, and as far as the entrance of the posterior auris,—the tem- poro-maxillary, this trunk being superficial in the pa- rotid above, but becoming deep inferiorly, where it joins the external jugular, in its course separating the portio dura from the external carotid artery. The posterior auris commences by auricular and stylo-mastoid branches, and, passing backwards in the parotid, opens into the external jugular. Internal Jugular Vein commences in the foramen lacerum posterius, at the termination of the lateral si- nus, and, descending on the outer side of the internal and common carotid arteries, unites at the sterno-cla- vicular articulation with the subclavian, to form the vena innominata. Whilst in the foramen lacerum, it presents an enlargement (gulf of the jugular), here re- ceiving the inferior petrosal sinus; opposite the cornu of the°os hyoides a second dilatation occurs where the following veins join the trunk:—Facial, lingual, occi- pital, ascending pharyngeal, and the superior thyroid; whilst below this transverse branches from the thyroid body, as well as communicating twigs from the anterior jugular, join it in its descent, and at the point of termi- nation a large oblong dilatation occurs, Avhich is occa- sionally twice the size of the original trunk. It lies in its course downwards on the rectus capitis anticus ma- jor and longus colli, and is closely attached to the ca- rotid above, the pneumogastric nerve intervening, but inferiorly diverging from the artery, more so ou the ri-ht than on the left side, forming the outer boundary ofa triangular space, through which the vagus passes in its course to the thorax. . Facial Vein commences on the frontal region, and descending by the side of the root of the nose is umted to its fellow by a transverse branch, then, passing down- wards and backwards, is joined by the nasal and sub- frontal branches, being here called the angular vein; next receiving branches from the eyelids, it runs obliquely downwards and backwards beneath the zygomatic mus-

THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 86 still more irregular where it unites with the posterior part of the body of the sphenoid, from which it is al- ways most difficult to detach it,—this is the clivus basis cranii; superiorly, it is concave from side to side, slop- ing downwards and backwards to the foramen magnum, and supporting the medulla oblongata, sixth pair of nerves, and basilar artery. As we proceed backwards from the upper surface of the basilar process, we ob- serve on the edges of the foramen magnum, correspond- ing to the condyles inferiorly, an oblong, elevated pro- cess of bone, forming the upper wall of the anterior condyloid hole. Behind and external to this is a, short but deep groove for the lateral sinus, before it joins the internal jugular vein. The anterior surface of the bone is concave, and divided into four compartments by two lines, which intersect each other at a right angle about the centre, forming an elevation which corresponds to the torcular Herophili internally, and the occipital pro- tuberance externally. The two superior chambers are triangular in shape, and lodge the posterior lobes of the cerebriim; the two inferior are irregularly quadri- lateral, to support the hemispheres of the cerebellum. The vertical ridge which divides them stretches from the foramen magnum below to the pointed process above, where it becomes continuous with the sagittal suture between the parietal bones; inferiorly, it is ele- vated and well marked, giving attachment to the falx cerebelli; superiorly, much more depressed where the falx cerebri is connected to it. The transverse ridge is double, with a groove dividing them; this is of unequal depth on either side, corresponding to the great lateral sinuses,—the conduits which convey the blood from the torcular Herophili to the internal jugular vein, and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli. If we now examine the circumference of the bone, we will find it to be deeply serrated above, for articulation with the parietal, several deep indentations occasionally occur- r'mcr for the reception of the ossa triquetra. It is here also comparatively thin; but below, where it umtes with the temporal, it becomes thicker and less spicu- lated anterior to the short groove for the termination of the lateral sinus; the margin becomes smooth and

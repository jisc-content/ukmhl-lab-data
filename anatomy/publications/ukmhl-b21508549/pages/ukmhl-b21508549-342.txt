THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 332 Use.â€”To rotate inwards; to secure the capsule in- ternally ; it is generally ruptured in dislocation into the axilla, and on its subsequent state of repair depends the future recurrence of the dislocation (Sir A. Cooper). DISSECTION OF THE ARM. Throw down the integument from the back and front of the arm, but at the bend of the elbow be careful to avoid injuring the superficial veins, Avhich are imbedded in the structure of the superficial fascia. These should now.be examined; but it must not be supposed that any individual description will be in all cases applicable to them, as they are subject to frequent variety. The Cephalic Vein is the most external; it com- mences on the back of the hand by a branch from the thumb, one from the index finger and the external ex- tremity of the dorsal venous plexus; it then winds for- wards over the supinator longus tendon, and about the junction of the inferior and middle thirds of thefore-arm, sometimes lower, it receives a branch formed by radi- cles from the ball of the thumb, and also a branch from the median venous plexus, that lies over the annular ligament. During its ascent, it receives cutaneous branches from the outer and back part of the fore-arm; lies at the bend of the elbow, between the tendon of the biceps and supinator longus, then between biceps and triceps, its further ascent being between the deltoid and great pectoral; then turns downwards and pierces the costo-coraco-clavicular ligament, and terminates in the axillary vein. The Basilic arises by a large branch from the in- ternal extremity of the dorsal arch, of which it appears to be the more direct efferent vessel; it then ascends along the posterior surface of the ulnar extensor, then turns forward at the inferior third of the fore-arm, and joins the vein of the fifth finger (vena Salvatella), that commences in the lower and posterior part of that finger; it passes upwards in front of the styloid process of the ulna, and joins the posterior branch. The trunk thus formed passes upwards over the pronator teres, and at the junction of the middle and superior thirds of the arm is

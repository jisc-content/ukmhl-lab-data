CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN. 550 to a certain amount, presses on its anterior wall until a fissure results, through which it escapes, when the breach is again repaired for the production of a fresh secretion, the nature of which is not clearly under- stood, but is conceived to be an elimination from the blood of something noxious and deleterious, which na- ture is anxious to remove from the system by this pro- cess (Carpenter). Aggregate Glandsâ€”These are known as the glands of Peyer, who was the first anatomist who described them accurately. They are found in masses of variable size and of an oval shape, on the anterior or convex wall of the intestine, being scarcely if ever to he ob- served in the duodenum, thinly scattered in the jejumim, but comparatively numerous in the ilium, the last of these being found on the ilio-ca3cal valve. They are evidently nothing more than an aggregation of the soli- tary glands, but much smaller, each being surrounded by its zone of csecal depressions, and occasionally pre- senting one also in their centre. It may, therefore, be safely argued that their function, whatever that may be, is similar to the solitary, and this appears to derive confirmation from the analogous nature of the contained fluid. In typhoid fevers and phthisis these glands be- come the receptacles of a specific deposit, which pro- duces their subsequent ulceration; whUst in remittent fevers the glands of Brunner become much more appa- rent, in consequence of their increase in size. Follicles of Liebbrkuhn are found throughout the Avhole extent of the intestinal canal, and consist of a series of small tubules, extending by their ca^cal extre- mity as far as the submucous tissue, while their free is marked by a small aperture opening on the mucous surface They are very closely packed together, and covered by conoidal epithelium, which extends also into the cavity of the tubule. From them is poured out the succus intestinalis, for the purpose of preservmg the proper moisture of the gut, while the crypts of Lie- berkuhn, depressions formed by the involution of the mucous membrane, accomplish apparent y a similar obiect. In periods of inflammation the follicles become very manifest, as they are then filled by a quantity of

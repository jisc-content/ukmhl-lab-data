78 THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. leg being represented by the os calcis; the two ante- rior externally by the base of the little toe, internally, by that of the great. Between these the bones form three remarkable arches, that on the inside being much the longest, strongest, and most curved, because on it the principal weight of the foot is thrown when in pro- gression. The deep excavation which here naturally exists in almost all individuals is commonly known as the hollow of the foot. The external arch wants the convexity of the last; it is much shorter, weaker, and in some presents almost a plane surface—such being termed flat-footed. The transverse arch extends be- tween the balls of the great and little toe; it is the shortest of the three, but extremely elastic and move- able, readily adapting itself to the inequalities which it may meet with, and again resuming its original shape where these cease to exist. It can readily be imagined what a tendency those arches must possess in breaking those shocks to which we are daily so liable, and of which we are scarcely sensible, unless in an un- conscious moment, when the foot, unprepared for such an occurrence, slips suddenly from an elevation into a depression; the shock striking the os calcis only, and not the arches, is propagated upwards along the limb, losing, no doubt, much of its intensity at each jomt and angle of curvature, but still is severe enough to cause some unpleasant feelings in the highest part of the framework of the human skeleton. We will avoid men- tioning here the peculiar cushions which nature has placed beneath the feet of the tripod, or the powerful apparatus by which these are maintained m position, as these will appear more properly in a different part of the work. -n ^ If we now look to the dorsum of the foot, we will ob- serve that it is likewise arched, the convexity varying essentially in different individuals, in some being consi- derable, in others presenting little or no elevation, but it is always higher on the inside than on the outside. It terminates above in the articulation with the bones of the leg, behind which it is again prolonged into that peculiar process, the calx—the arm of the lever, which, acted on by the powerful muscles attached to it, raises

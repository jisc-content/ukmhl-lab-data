476 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. serted into the metatarsal bone of the fifth toe. In con- sequence of the intimate connexion of the two muscles, the relations may be examined in conjunction. Relations.—It is covered by the fascia of the leg, and lies on the interosseous ligament and fibula; the exter- nal edge corresponds to the peronseus longus and mus- culo-cutaneous nerve; inferiorly to the external malleo- lus, which separates it from the peronseus breyis; inter- nally to the tibialis anticus and anterior tibial artery and nerve, and below to the extensor pollicis proprius; on the dorsum of the foot it lies on the short extensor, and is contained in a proper fibrous sheath; in the su- perior part of the leg a thin septum separates it from the tibialis anticus, and a much stronger lamina from the peronaeus longus, the sheath being completed posteriorly by the interosseous membrane; the superior part of the muscle is pierced by the anterior tibial nerve. Action.—To extend the toes, and flex the ankle-joint. The muscles on the external side of the leg are two in number,—peronasus longus and brevis. Peron^us Longus lies on the outer side of the leg, fleshy above, tendinous below; it arises fleshy from the head of the fibula, outer side of the tibia, from the up- per third of the outer angle of the fibula, by tendmous lamina which separate the anterior and posterior mus- cles of the leg; it then passes downwards, and m the lower half of its course the fleshy fibres surrotmd the tendon, which runs downwards, outwards, and back- wards, so as to reach the posterior surface of the exter- nal malleolus, where it is received into a shallow groove with the peroneus brevis, but separated from the bone by a bursa and a layer of stratiform cartilage, and pre- served in position by a fibrous sheath; it then passes downwards and forwards, crossing the middle slip of the external lateral ligament; grooves the side of the os cal- cis, and bends at first downwards, then mwards and forwards, grooving the cuboid bone inferiorly, and is inserted directly into the base of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, also into the second, and by a ten- dinous slip into the external sesamoid at tiie base oj the first phalanx, and occasionally into the external cuneiform.

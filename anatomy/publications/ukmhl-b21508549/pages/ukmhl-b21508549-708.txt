698 NERVOUS SYSTEM. terior margin of which it can be traced as far nearly as its origin. The ultimate division of the plexus takes place as it lies on the tendon of the subscapularis, and they have generally been classed into branches that are external, internal, and posterior to the axillary artery; the first consisting of the external cutaneous and outer head ot the median; the second, of the internal cutaneous, in- ner head of the median, ulno-cutaneous, and ulnar; and the third, of the circumflex and musculo-spiral. We will now proceed to examine them individually. External Cutaneous.â€”This is likeAvise known as the musculo-cutaneous or perforans Casserii, and, after the internal, is the smallest branch of the plexus; it arises in common with the outer head of the median, descends obliquely downwards and outwards over the neck of the humerus and anterior circumflex artery, perforates or sometimes passes under the coraco-bra- chialis, then lies between the biceps in front and the brachialis anticus behind, where it occasionally com- municates by a delicate filament with the median; about two inches above the elbow-joint it escapes from be- neath the outer edge of the former muscle, and, becommg subcutaneous, divides into two branches,-an anterior and posterior: the former running downwards along the front and radial side of the fore-arm beneath the median cephalic vein and in the layers of the superficial fascia, and can be traced as low down as the thenar emmence; in its course along the fore-arm it thro^vs off numerous filaments to the integuments, and at the carpus com- municates with the radial, afterwards distributing slen- der branches to the skin of the thuinb, with others which accompany the radial artery, and are bst on the synovial membrane of the radio-carpal articulation; the latter or posterior division winds to the back-part ot he Tore a?m, descends nearly vertically, likewise in- vested in the superficial fascia, supplying the integu- ments n its course, and can be traced only as far as the l ack part of the carpus. The humeral distribution of he external cutaneous nerve is muscular, which seem to prove that it should be considered merely as an offset of Ihe median; it supplies very freely the coraco-bra- chialis, biceps, and brachialis anticus.

363 MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. R 2 The Superficial Muscles of the Abdomen consist of five pair,—namely, external oblique, internal oblique, transversalis abdominis, rectus, and pyramidalis. Make an incision from the ensiform cartilage to the pubis, and from the middle line to the anterior superior spinous process ; then reflect the flaps. Superficial Fascia—This subcutaneous layer is continuous with the similar structure of the regions in the vicinity; thin above; strong and laminated in- feriorly, containing a variable quantity of fat; white pale bands are seen traversing its structure; these are believed to have many characters in common with the unstriped muscle, but it is probable that they are simply fibrous tissue condensed into fesciculi; on its surface and within it may be seen cutaneous nerves, arteries, and veins, with a few lymphatic glands; inferiorly it passes over Poupart's ligament, to which it is connected through the medium of Scarpa's fascia; at the pubis the laminar arrangement is well marked, where it passes on the penis to form the false suspensory liga- ment; m the female it is loaded with firm adeps, and forms the mons veneris; externally it passes downwards on the cord m the male to the scrotum, where it deo-e- nerates into areolar tissue; the superficial vessels and glands are placed between the lamina, but by minute and careful dissection so many as five layers may be formed of the superficial fascia; the greater the deposit ot iat, the less visible become the fibrous bands ap- pearing under such circumstances weak and indistinct Let the nerves and vessels be next examined. Two sets ol cutaneous nerves are seen, the lateral being branches trom the six inferior intercostal, which pierce the ex- ternal oblique or escape between its indigitations, then divide into a posterior and anterior branch, the for- mer _ being reflected backwards over the latissimus dorsi, the latter passing forwards as far as the middle line, and terminating in the skin. The anterior cuta neous pierce the anterior part of the sheath of the rec- tus, and form a plexiform interlacement on the linea alba; they are the terminating branches of the intercos tal trunks. The posterior cutaneous, derived from the iiio-scrotal and last dorsal, have been already noticed

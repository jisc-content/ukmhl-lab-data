BRANCHES OF FEMORAL. 859 Relations.—Anteriorly, at first slightly overlapped by the femoral artery, then by merely integumeijit, super- ficial and deep fascia, then by the edge of the rectus and sartorius, then by femoral artery again, but sepa- rated from it by its own,—the femoral, and external circumflex ilii veins, with the obdurator saphenous nerve and insertion of the adductor longus; poste- riorly in succession from above downwards, tendons of psoas and iliacus, crureus, edge of vastus inter- nus, insertions of pectineus, and adductors brevis and magnus. Anomalies are only those of origin, as it may arise in common with the femoral, from the external iliac; or, if from the femoral, it may spring from this ves- sel, either one, two, three, or four inches below Pou- part's ligament; but cases are very rare, indeed, in which it even approximates to the last-mentioned point. Collateral Branches of PEOFimDA.—External and internal circumflex ilii, and three perforating arteries. External Circumflex Always a large branch, arising from the profunda immediately after its origin from the femoral; it passes outwards between the branches of the anterior crural nerve, over the tendons of the psoas, iliacus, and crureus, and under the sartorius, rec- tus, and divides into three branches,—ascending, mid- dle, and descending. Ascending Branch passes upwards and outwards in a fusiform space, filled with loose areolar tissue, bounded in front by the sartorius; externally by the tensor va- gina femoris; behind by the edge of the gluteus me- diiis and great trochanter, and internally, by the iliacus internus; at the anterior inferior spine it anastomoses with the profunda of the glutseal. Middle Branch In direction the continuation of the external circumflex; it insinuates itself first between the crureus and vastus externus, then between the lat- ter muscle and the bone, the back part of which latter it ultimately reaches, piercing the attachments of the glutaaus maximus and adductor magnus, anastomosing with a similar branch of the internal circumflex ilii. Descending Branch runs at first downwards and in-

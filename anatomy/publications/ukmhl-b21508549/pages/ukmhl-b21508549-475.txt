MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 465 racic duct, and on the left, vena azygos minor; the ten- dinous arrangement of the outlet of the canal averts injurious compression of the vessel, and the size of the canal superiorly obviates a similar consequence. Caval Opening.—To examine it effectually, the liver should be removed; its shape is quadrilateral, bounded on the abdominal aspect by four tendinous fascictili, and on the thoracic surface the figure is somewhat oval; as the vessel passes through this fibrous ring, the anterior edge is prolonged on the abdominal surface as far as the liver, where it becomes continuous with the capsule of Glisson; the posterior margin passes upwards on the thoracic portion as far as the right auricle, whilst the lateral margins ascend for some distance on the vein, and then terminate abruptly. This opening is on a level with the tenth dorsal vertebra, formed in the structure where the middle and the right leaves of the central ten- don unite, and through it pass the vena cava inferior, and a few filaments of the phrenic nerve. In many diving animals the caval opening is perfectly muscular, such being the structure in the otter, but although it presents all the characters of a sphincter, there is this peculiarity,—that an aponeurotic expansion is prolonged from the muscular opening, which invests the intraperi- cardial portion of the inferior cava; and in such in- stances the latter vessel, together with the hepatic veins, exhibit a normal dilatation within the abdomen. This dilatation does not appear to be, however, dependent on the muscularity of the orifice; as it equally exists ill the bird tribe with aquatic habits, as the northern diver, although the diaphragm is merely rudimentary. (Esophageal Opening.—Situated on a level with the ninth dorsal vertebra, elliptical in shape, and placed behind the left leaf of the central tendon, ante- rior and to the left side of the aortic opening. Its structure is muscular, formed by the decussating fasci- culi of the crura; but sometimes the anterior edge is tendinous, and occasionally a thin slip passes on the surface of the oesophagus downwards to the stomach: through it pass the oesophagus, pneumogastric nerves, and the ascending branch of the coronaria ventriculi artery. Occasionally we have seen this opening fully

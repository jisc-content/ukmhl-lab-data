MUSCLES OF THE ABDOMEN. 375 testicle had not descended (Cooper). Curling has seen the cremaster ascending to be attached to the testicle in the abdomen; but this subject will be recurred to hereafter. Action.—The internal oblique compresses the abdo- minal viscera, assists in the expulsion of urine and fffices; also rotates the body to its own side and bends it forwards. The cremaster raises the testicle, and urges the semen in its course through the vas deferens; its action in producing the vermicular motions of the gland during the venereal orgasm is very doubtful. Transversalis Abdominis Similar in figure to the last-described muscle. It arises tendinous from the lumbar fascia, from all the crest of the ilium in front of the attachment of the ilio-lumbar ligament, by trian- gular aponeurotic slips from the inner surface of the cartilages of the last two ribs, and by fleshy bands from the five next in succession,—the latter indigita- ting with the origins of the diaphragm; the fibres pass forwards, the inferior curving downwards, and termi- nate in an aponeurosis sooner than the internal oblique. It is united at the linea semilunaris with the tendon of the oblique, and is inserted into the ensiform carti- lage, linea alba, pubis, and linea ileo-pectinea. Mr, Guthrie describes the cord as passing through a ring in this muscle, which may be thus expressed: That the fibres arising from Poupart's ligament take their origin beneath the cord, passing at first upwards and outwards, then curving downwards and inwards to reach the conjoined tendons; in fact, describing an ellip- tical aperture with an inferior concave pillar and a su- perior, straight: this arrangement, however, is not al- ways present; but certainly it does exist in the majo- rity of subjects, although not equally well marked in all _ EelaUve Anatomij—With respect to the lumbar fas- cia,—the three leaves of this structure have been fully described in the Anatomy of the Lumbar Eegion. The inferior margin is arched like the internal oblique, but lies somewhat higher up, being at first anterior to the cord, then arching over it, the conjoined tendons form- ing a posterior relation for it at their insertions; supe- riorly it is stretched between the cartilage of the sixth

CERVICAL PLEXUS. 693 and under the tendon of the omo-hyoid, with the descen- dens noni of the hypo-glossal, to form the omo-hyoidean plexus, which is flattened and triangular in shape; from it proceed numerous filaments for the supply of the omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and sterno-hyoid, some of which proceed upwards in their structure, as far as the OS hyoides, Avhile others can be traced downwards nearly as far as their origin from the ribs; they are like- wise remarkable in being distributed to the deep and not the superficial surface of these muscles. Muscular Branches consist of branches to the an- terior recti, levator anguli, scapulae, trapezius, and rhomboidei, which need no special description, but the phrenic, destined for one of the most important muscles in the function of respiration, will require its course and distribution to be examined with greater accui-acy. The Phrenic Nerve, properly speaking, takes its direct origin from the fourth, but it also receives a large reinforcing branch from the third, and occasionally another from the fifth, which unites with it almost im- mediately after it is formed, but where this is absent it will be found that the twig to the subclavius from the brachial plexus is always extremely large, and that It throws off" to the phrenic the anastomotic branch, which passes downwards and inwards, to join it at a very acute angle, between the subclavian vein and cartilage of the first rib, and in front of the internal mammary artery. The nerve thus formed descends at first on the posterior edge of the scalenus anticus, but near the aperture of the thorax it has passed to its anterior bor- der; It is closely bound to the muscle by the deep cer- vical fascia, presenting a decidedly flattened appearance, and is crossed at a right angle by the transversalis colli and humeri arteries, while the cervicalis ascendens runs upwards, parallel but internal to it; passing now over the subclavian artery, at the junction of its first and second stages, beneath the subclavian vein, and between the thyroid axis, which is internal to it, and the edge of the scalenus, which is external to it, it enters the cavity of the thorax, lying at first to the outer side of the internal mammary artery, and then

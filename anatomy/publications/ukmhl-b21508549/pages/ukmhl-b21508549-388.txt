THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 378 the contents from either of the three great cavities of the body, namely, the head, chest, or abdomen. In the latter instance, the escapement may occur of either in- testine (enterocele), or omentum (epiplocele), or it may consist of both (entero-epiplocele). In the normal con- dition of the parietes a reciprocal interchange of pres- sure subsists between the containing parts and those contained; but when the pressure from without, as in violent muscular efforts, or the pressure from within, depending on augmented volume of the viscera, becomes inordinate, the weakest portions of the walls yield to the impulse, either suddenly or gradually permitting portions of the contents to escape from within the na- tural limits of the cavity. These weaker points are usually found in the situation where openings occur for the transmission of parts either into or out of the ca- vity,â€”usually, we say, because wounds, congenital de- ficiencies, or relaxations, frequently render the waUs less capable of resisting protrusions than the sites of foetal openings. In the inguinal region a superficial and deep opening are present for the passage of the elements of the spermatic cord; but nature in the fashioning has exhibited an exquisite perfection, by placing an oblique canal between the two rings, so that the greater the amount of pressure, provided it does not exceed certain limits, the more security is afforded against pro- trusion by the approximation of the opposite walls of the intervening canal. If a line is drawn from a point three inches below the umbilicus to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, and Poupart's ligament be adopted as the inferior boundary, such will be the space or inguinal region connected with the surgical ana- tomy of this important accident. The integument of the inguinal region is fine and moveable on the subjacent fascia, but somewhat more ad- herent to the line of Poupart's ligament. On raising this structure the superficial fascia is seen, more or less apo- neurotic, and containing a variable quantity of adipose tissue, glands, and superficial vessels; beneath it Scarpa's fascia constitutes the third layer, subjacent to the last; the external oblique tendon, with Camper's fascia, re- presents the fourth, and the internal oblique, with the

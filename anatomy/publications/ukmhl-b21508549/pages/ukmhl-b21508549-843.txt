833 PALMAR ARCHES. from the interosseous trunk; it descends in company with the median nerve, and terminates by anastomosing with the same as the preceding. Anterior CARPAL.—Very small, arising, as its name implies, opposite the carpus, and, passing outwards, com- municates with a similar branch from the radial beneath the flexor tendons. Posterior Carpal comes off nearly opposite to the last, winds outwards on the back of the carpus, and un- der the extensor tendons, and anastomoses with the posterior carpal of the radial. Eamus Superficialis is one of the terminal divisions of the ulnar, arising immediately below the annular liga- ment; it passes at flrst downwards, and then winds out- wards, and terminates by anastomosing with the super- ficialis volfe, in order to form the superficial palmar arch. _ Eamus Profunda is the second terminal branch; it sinks between the abductor and flexor minimi dir^iti, crosses over the bases of the metacarpal bones and'^in- terossei muscles, to communicate with the profunda of the radial, and thus form the deep palmar arch. PALMAR Arches are two in number,—superficial and deep; the former, as we have already observed, is formed by the ramus superficialis of the ulnar, which gives it its greatest supply of blood, and the superfi- cialis volffi of the radial, or where this is absent, by the radialis indicis. The convexity of the arch thus consti- tuted is directed downwards and slightly inwards, point- ing to the interval between the little and ring fingers and it corresponds very nearly to the transverse cleft which IS visible in the palm of every individual. -SetewTzs.—Anteriorly, integument, palmar fascia and a variable quantity of granular fat; posteriorly' flexor tendons, with the digital branches of the median nerve, the flattened expansion of which lies superior to it, or within its curve. CoLLATEUAL BRANCHES—From its convexity, only four in number, rarely five, where the radialis indicis is absent; they are called digital; of these the most inter- nal is the smallest, and, passing downwards and inwards runs along the ulnar side of the little finger, as far as Its last phalanx; the second is larger, and descends to

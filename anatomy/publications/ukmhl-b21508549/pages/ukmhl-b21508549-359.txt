349 MUSCLES OF THE FORE-ARM. it is separated from superficial to deep, by the cephalic vein, external cutaneous and musculo-spiral nerves, ra- dial recurrent, with anterior branches of the musculo- spiral artery; below this it lies on the brachialis, exten- sor carpi radialis longior and brevior, fiexor pollicis, pro- nator teres, and radial artery; the dorsal branch of the radial nerve lies beneath the tendon; the insertion is between the flexor pollicis and the extensor ossis me- tacarpi. In the arm, it has behind it, the external in- termuscular septum and posterior branches of the mus- culo-spiral artery, and triceps: its origin above is sepa- rated from the deltoid by the musculo-spiral nerve, and one head of the brachialis anticus; in the arm sometimes the belly is extremely thin, being flattened by its pres- sure against the brachialis, but in the fore-arm, when this pressure is removed, then it is flattened from before backwards; the inner edge of the belly serves as a guide to cutting down on the brachial artery, at the bend of the elbow, whilst the tendon acts as a similar guide to the radial artery in the fore-arm. Action.—To supinate the hand, when it has been pro- nated, afterwards to flex the fore-arm; its power is greatly augmented by the length of the acting arm of the lever to which it is attached. Reflect this° muscle and expose the— ' Extensor Carpi Radialis Longior.—Arises from a rough triangular space, about one inch and a half in length, into which the external condyloid ridge expands below, also from a tendon common to it and the short extensor, as well as from the external intermuscular septum; it then forms a fleshy belly, which terminates in a tendon above the middle of the fore-arm; after de- scending to the inferior third of the radius, it turns slightly backwards, passes beneath the posterior annu- lar ligament in a groove behind the styloid process, and is inserted flat into the head of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. Relations.—It lies on the humerus, on the extensor carpi radialis brevior, and wrist-joint. It is covered by the supinator longus, crossed obliquely by the extensor ossis metacarpi, and primi internodii pollicis, the radial artery, and the extensor secundi internodii pollicis.

398 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. to the anus, and a second backwards to the coccyx; also a transverse one from that orifice to the tubera ischii, and unite them by a circular cut around the anal orifice. Now let the four flaps be reflected outwards, and exa- mine the subcutaneous layer, superficial sphincters, and subcutaneous nerves and vessels. The subcutaneous layer is continuous above with the superficial fascia of the scrotum; laterally with that of the thighs, and pos- teriorly it merges in the fatty areolar tissue of the ischio-rectal fossa; it is extremely fatty in the child, and also at the middle periods of life, but in the adult it is dense, and frequently exhibits aponeurotic fasciculi; but as the fat predominates the aponeurotic structure disappears. When this is cautiously raised, a second fascia is seen; this should be named projjer perineal fas- cia; it is dense, of a bluish white colour, stronger than the superficial, but yet semitransparent, attached late- rally to the rami of the ischium and pubis, continuous above and before with Scarpa's fascia on the scrotum, and posteriorly it bends upwards behind the transverse perinei muscles, and is united with the anterior edge of the base of the triangular ligament; from its deep surface two septa pass upwards to be attached to the perineal face of the triangular ligament, thus dividing the anterior pe- rineum into three compartments, the central, contaming the urethra and acceleratores urinse, the lateral inclosing the crura and erectores penis. In consequence of these relations, urine extravasated in the perineum cannot be- come difi'used either laterally or posteriorly, but follows the course of Scarpa's fascia upwards on the scrotum, and so by the cord is conducted to the abdomen,â€”the vertical septa preventing its contact with the crura, and producing the central funnel-shaped tumour so indica- tive of this accident. On raising the fascia the superfi- cial vessels and nerves are exposed : the former con- sist of the transverse perineal artery, a branch of the internal pudic, sometimes it comes ofi" from the long perineal artery; it winds round the transversus pen- nei muscle to its cutaneous surface, runs inwards, and divides into anterior, posterior, and communicatmg branches: the former pass forwards to the accelerator uringe and bulb; the latter backwards to the verge ot

692 NERVOUS SYSTEM. ter, piercing a small portion of the parotid gland, and communicating with the portio dura, emerges on the mastoid process, beneath theretrahens aurem, and is dis- tributed to the integument of the corresponding surface of the concha, having given off a small twig to the oc- cipitalis minor. It supplies, however, no muscle. SuPERFiciALis CoLLT.—This arises, in common with the preceding, from the loop of the second and third nerve; passes at first backwards, and then winds for- wards around the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid; crosses this muscle at a right-angle, beneath the exter- nal jugular vein, and, piercing first the cervical fascia, and then the platysma, divides into two branches,—a superior and inferior: the former dips at first down- wards, and then, arching upwards, divides into a number of fine filaments, which are distributed to the skin, as high as the os hyoides, while the latter take an upward direction, and dividing in the same manner, supply the integuments of the suprahyoid region, anastomosing with twigs of the portio dura. We may here observe that the two branches just described may arise dis- tinctly from the plexus and run an independent course; we have likewise seen an instance in which the superior was extremely large, and where it united directly with the cervical division of the facial, which was remarkably small, both distributing filaments from the common trunk thus formed. SurRA-ACROMiALand Supra-clavicular Branches.— These arise from the third and fourth nerves; proceed downwards over the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, imbedded in the superficial fascia, some passing outwards over the external extremity of the clavicle, where they are distributed to the skin over the anterior aspect of the deltoid (acromial), and others winding for- wards and inwards, over the centre of that bone, to supply the integuments over the greater pectoral, a tew of them extending as far as the sternum. Deep Branches.—These maybe divided into commu- nicating and muscular. The former, or communicans nom, is a small twig, sometimes double; it arises Iroin the loop of the second and third, and, passing downwards and in- wards, over the internal j ugular vein, unites on that vessel,

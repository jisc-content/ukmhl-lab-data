At a period ranging from the twenty- Tst to the twenty-fourfh year, ossification is completed, and any further increase of length precluded. To prove this fact, Hunter introduced two pellets into the already ossified shaft of the tibia of a young pig, ac- curately Measuring the distance incl^^^^ h^then allowed sSfficient time to elapse, in order that a decided growth might take place, when he examined the bone and was unable to discover any appreciable ncrease as to distance between the pellets.

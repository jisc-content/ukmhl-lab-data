THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 428 otherwise its rupture may lead to the erroneous con- clusion of its absence in some cases; it is always present in man, and indeed in the whole class of mammalia. VESicuLiE Skminales.â€”These are symmetrical organs, of an ovoid figure, situated diverging at the base of the bladder; each vesicle is bounded internally by the vas deferens; externally by the lateral true ligaments; pos- teriorly and externally the ureter and cul de sac of the peritoneum; anteriorly by the prostate; inferiorly by the rectum; and above by the inferior fundus of the bladder and trigone; their colour is grey, and they are also lobulated, in length being about two and a half inches; in width half-an-inch, and in depth, a quarter of an inch. They vary in size, being small in the child and in old age, large in the adult. The left is some- what smaller than the right, and the surface is invested by a dense fibrous layer, formed by the splitting of the recto-vesical fascia, which also includes the vas deferens in the same capsule; they are likewise moveable on the rectum and bladder, being connected to the latter by a yellowish, fine, areolar tissue. A section of the vesicle exhibits a cellular structure, with a dense connecting fibrous bed, but if the body is subjected to maceration, so as to destroy this tissue, it can be unravelled into a tube about nine inches in length, with dense tunics, re- sembling the vas deferens. The anterior extremity is narrow and prolonged into a duct, which joins the vas deferens to form the ductus communis ejaculatorius, and in this situation the vas deferens is flattened and sometimes lobulated; the common ejaculatory duct is from half to three-quarters of an inch in length; it enters a notch in the base of the prostate, losing the dense deferential tunic at this point; passes upwards and forwards above the junction of the lateral lobes, and below the middle, opens on the seminal papilla of the verumontanum in the prostatic portion of the urethra; the oblique passage of the duct through the prostate, and for so great a distance, obviates the tendency ot the expulsion of the semen during micturition, a co- lumn of urine always pressing on the thin and unre- sisting duct during that act, which precludes any trans- mission by those canals.

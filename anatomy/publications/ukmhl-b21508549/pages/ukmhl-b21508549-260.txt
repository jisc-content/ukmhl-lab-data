250 THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. confining the gland to its anatomical region, but also sending septa into its structure, connecting and like- wise isolating its lobules, attached superiorly to the zy- goma, posteriorly to the mastoid process, cartilage of the ear, and tendinous anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle; anteriorly it dips beneath the edge of the gland, separating it from the masseter, passing deep to be connected with the following; when the external jugular vein is raised with its superficial covering, the deep cervical fascia will be seen attached to the styloid process and internal side of the ramus, together with the angle of the lower jaw, forming the stylo-maxillary ligament, ascending to be attached to the vaginal pro- cess above, and continuous with the internal lateral ligament anteriorly; thus the parotid is enclosed in a fibrous pouch with a well-marked outline that precludes the escape of purulent depots in several directions; for- wards the diffusion is prevented by the dipping in of the superficial layer beneath the gland, backwards by the continuity of the two layers at the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, below by the pouch formed by the separation of the superficial cervical fascia from the stylo-maxillary ligament, and above the intimate junc- tion of the fascia to the zygoma, precludes the possibi- lity of escape in that direction; it consequently seeks the nearest and least resisting outlet, escaping through the fissure of Santorini in the cartilaginous meatus of the external ear; in this capsule there exist certain openings, by which parts enter and leave the gland, that will more properly come under consideration with the deeper structures. The parotid is somewhat square on its superficial surface, often with a caudate prolon- gation inferiorly, and a similar expansion superiorly in the vicinity of the duct. The following are its bounda- ries:â€”superiorly by the zygoma, inferiorly by a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the sterno-mastoid muscle, one inch, sometimes more, below its insertion; posteriorly by the cartilage of the ear, themastoid process, sterno-mastoid, and digastric muscles; anteriorly by the ramus of the jaw, masseter muscle, of which it overlaps the posterior third; from the superior anterior angle of the gland arises Steno's duct; this is about the size of a goose-

THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 226 Orbicularis Palpebrarum, commonly described as a sphincter muscle, consists of an upper and lower seg- ment, which, taken conjointly, represent an ellipse, with a tendinous interruption internally. It arises from the upper and lower margins of the tendo oculi, from the internal angular process of the os frontis, and nasal process of the superior maxillary bone; the fibres pass in semicurves outwards, meeting at the external can- thus; the inferior segment has likewise an origin by short fibres from the orbital edge of the superior maxil- lary and malar bones. Structure and Relations.—It is divided into three portions,—the orbital, palpebral, and ciliary, forming concentric curves from without inwards. The orbital fibres are thick, strong, and red, like other animal muscles; the palpebral are thin, pale, and weak, with the physical aspect of the organic sheets of muscular fibre; the ciliary constitute a thin fasciculus at the margin of either lid, decussating at their commissures; these are also pale, very much resembling the tissue of the longitudinal bands of the large intestine. Its rela- tions will now be considered. Above, it lies on the corrugator supercilii, supra-orbital nerve, and artery bone, superior palpebral ligament, and tarsal cartilage; and also on the superior tarsal arch of nerves and arte- ries ; inferiorly, it lies on the bone, the outer head of the levator labii superioris alajque nasi, which sepa- rates it from the infra-orbital nerve and artery, on the origin of the great zygomatic and subcutaneous malse nerve, inferior palpebral ligament, tarsal cartilage, tar- sal branch of the superior maxillary nerve, and palpe- bral artery; internally, on the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, tendo oculi, lachrymal sac, supra and infratrochlear nerves, frontal and nasal branches of ophthalmic, and corresponds by its inner margin to the pyramidalis nasi, and outer head of the levator labii superioris alosque nasi ; externally, it lies on the temporal fascia and malar bone, and also on the orbital branch of the superior maxillary nerve, as it pierces the temporal fascia. In addition, the superior marain of the muscle is united to the occipito-frontalis; the lower part receives the highest fibres of the platys-

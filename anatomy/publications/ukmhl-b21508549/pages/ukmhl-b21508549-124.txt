THE OSSEOUS SYSTEM. 114 can scarcely be said to exist at all, but with succeeding years it gradually becomes more developed, so as to ap- proach at the adult period to a right angle; with de- clining life it again diminishes, and as the teeth decay and fall, it gradually becomes more obtuse, assuming in old age, with its imbecility, the characteristic features of childhood. We will examine it as it appears in the adult; at this period it is quadrilateral in shape, pre- senting two surfaces, an internal and external, and four margins, an anterior, a posterior, inferior, and superior; the external surface is generally flat, but rough in order to afford firmer attachment to the masseter muscle, the anterior portion of which is inserted into the lower part in front of its angle, while the aponeurotic fibres of its posterior part, gliding beneath the other, are firmly implanted into the upper part of the ramus, as high as the sigmoid notch; the internal surface is very irregular; the angle and the parts adjacent are elevated, and rough for the insertion of the internal pterygoid and stylo- maxillary ligament; above, and a little anterior to this is the large dental foramen, leading obliquely down- wards and forwards into the canal of the same name, for the transmission of the dental vessels and nerves for the supply of the teeth; the orifice of this canal is bounded superiorly and internally by a sharp process, the spur, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the jaw; above and posteriorly the bone is concave and smooth, where the internal maxillary glides over it in order to reach the pterygoid space, while more anteriorly it is elevated, and rough for the attachment of the buccino-pharyngeal aponeurosis. We have already stated that the alveolar process posteriorly is prolonged as a groove, forming the anterior edge of the coronoid pro- cess ; this groove inferiorly gives attachment to the bucci- nator muscle, while above it afi'ords insertion to the ante- rior fibres of the temporal; the posterior edge is rounded, slightly concave, and is imbedded in the parotid gland; the superior presents two remarkable processes, the coro- noid anteriorly, andcondyloid posteriorly; these are sepa- rated by a depression, concave and nearly semicircular, its margins exceedingly sharpâ€”the sigmoid notch, which gives passage to the masseteric nerve and artery, for

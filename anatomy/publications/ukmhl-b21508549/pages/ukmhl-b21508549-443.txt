The staff is now withdrawn, and the blades of the lithotome protruded, the instrument being previously reversed, so as to present its concavity downwards, and withdrawn in a direction downwards and forwards in the axis of the original wound, making a flap of the lower part of the prostate; the finger is then to be introduced into the bladder to direct the for- ceps to the stone.

The superficial fascia in this region is strong externally, loaded with fat in the infant and female, but firm and frequently strengthened by aponeurotic bands in the male adult; it likewise consists of two lamina of un- equal density, separated by lymphatic glands, the three superficial branches of the femoral artery, with their corresponding veins,—namely, external pudic, external circumflex ilii, and superficial epigastric; these have been described with the superficial investments of the abdomen; the short saphenous nerve or branch of the u

NERVOUS SYSTEM, 620 of the organ processes, which are seven in number,— namely, the choroid plexuses of the lateral, third and fourth ventricles, and the velum iuterpositum. By its superficial surface it is connected loosely to the arach- noid, many intervals existing between them; for in- stance,—at the subarachnoid spaces corresponding to the involutions at the inferior cornu of the lateral ven- tricles ; and lastly, at the sulcus for the olfactory nerves, while the deep surface is connected to the cortical struc- ture of the brain by vessels which tear the cineritious substance when the membrane is forcibly removed. The pia mater represents the nutritious membrane of the brain, being similar to the neurilemma of the nerves, and is likewise of utility in allowing the vessels to break up to an extreme degree of tenuity prior to their entrance into the yielding medullary matter,—in this way tending to diminish the impulse of the circulating system, which might either injure or exercise too sti- mulating an effect otherwise on the organ, its function being similar to the retes of Galen and Hovius in that respect. THE BRAIN. Many different modes are adopted for the examina- tion of this central organ of the nervous system, each having its peculiar utility, either in reference to the display of the formation of the organ or to the relative position of the several bodies which compose it. In pro- secuting the former inquiry, the organ may be dissected from below upwards, and in the latter from above down- wards; but as the student cannot pursue with advan- tage the whole investigation on a single brain, we prefer the mode by which he" becomes at first conversant with the number, size, position, and relations of the indivi- dual parts of which it is composed, prior to his pro- ceeding with the more complicated examination ot its anatomy, as implied by its development and those phy- siological relations which the several parts bear to each other. Tiie brain is divided into cerebrum, cerebellum, ana medulla oblongata,—the first being the great brain, the second the lesser, and the third the primordial portion

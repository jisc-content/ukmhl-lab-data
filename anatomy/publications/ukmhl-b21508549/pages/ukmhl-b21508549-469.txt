459 MUSCLES OF THE THIGH. ciculi, passing downwards and outwards, the external inserted by a broad aponeurosis into the line leadino- from the great trochanter to the linea aspera, into the whole length of that line, and into its continuation to the internal condyle; the internal fibres are more verti- cal, and are collected into a thick, round edge, that can be felt beneath the skin on the inner side of the thi'i'h, are then received into the upper and expanded part of a round tendon, that descends to be inserted into a well- marked elevation on the internal condyle of the femur, above the origin of the internal lateral ligament. Relations—Posteriorly it is covered by the hamstring muscles and the great sciatic nerve, also by the gluteus maximus above; anteriorly by the obturator externus, posterior division of the obturator nerve, adductor brevis, longus, pectineus, femoral artery, vein, and saphenous nerve; internally it corresponds to the fascia, sartorius, and gracilis; externally, to the bone; while the superior edge corresponds to the quadratus femoris, obturator ex- ternus tendon, and termination of the internal circumflex of the profunda; the superior fibres are often separated by large intervals, and are thick and strong, and the internal and external portions are separated by the femoral artery, vein, and saphenous nerve. Near the femoral linear attachments four apertures exist, for the passage of the perforating arteries, andinferiorly alarge tendinous opening for the femoral vessels. Action.—To adduct the thigh, and flex it. The Hamstring Muscles are three in number, biceps flexor cruris, semitendinosus, and semimembra- nosus, and are seen by turning the thigh on its anterior surface. Biceps Flexor Cruris consists of two heads, a long and short; the former arises by a strong tendon from the superior and external part of the tuber ischii, from Avhich it is separated by a bursa; this tendon passes downwards, becoming thicker, connected internally to the tendon of the semitendinosus, and giving origin to the fleshy fibres of the muscle by its posterior surface; it then forms a fusiform belly, that descends outwards and a little forwards; two inches above the flexure of the knee-joint it ends in a broad tendon, which receives the X 2

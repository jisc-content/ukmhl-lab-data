PERITONEUM. 537 2 A 3 several branches of arteries derived from the epiploic and superior mesenteric. It forms the bond of union between the stomach and colon, suspending the arch of the latter, and maintaining it in its normal position. Teansverse Mesocolon This is merely the con- tinuation backwards and upwards of the two re- llected layers of the great omentum, which, after em- bracing the arch of the colon, pass backwards from it to the spinal column, suspending that portion of the great intestine. We have already remarked how the two layers are again separated at the spine by the in- ferior transverse portion of the duodenum, the one as- cending and binding down the several parts in connexion with the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity, and con- stituting the posterior boundary of the great cul de sac of the peritoneum which is thrust in through the fora- men of Winslow,—the ascending layer of the transverse mesocolon; the other proceeding downwards to form the sevei-al processes which we will presently describe, the descending layer of the transverse mesocolon. Mesentery—This is one of the most important in- flections of the whole serous sac, as it contributes in a great degree to maintaining the small intestines in their normal position. It is attached to the left side of the second lumbar vertebra, from which it passes downwards and to the right iliac fossa, where it becomes continuous with the serous membrane of that region. From the oblique line which it thus forms, it is reflected downwards at first, so as to cover the anterior surface of the whole of the small intestine, passes beneath its inferior border, and again passing behind it unites with the layer iii front, thus enveloping their whole circumference except superiorly and posteriorly, where a narrow portion is left uncovered, corresponding to the entrance of the ves- sels for their supply. The mesentery extends from the commencement of the jejunum to the termination of the ilium; the two layers of which it is composed beinrr separated by numerous branches derived from the su- perior mesenteric artery, glands, and lacteals, in their course to the receptaculum chyli. Lumbar Mesocolons.—These are lateral processes de- rived from the last mentioned, which are thrown over

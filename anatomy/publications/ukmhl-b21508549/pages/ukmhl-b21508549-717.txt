707 DORSAL NERVES. the thorax and mammary gland; to which it distributes several cutaneous twigs. Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Dorsal be- long to the intercostal spaces of the false ribs; they like- wise, after proceeding for some distance, divide into a continuous trunk and'a perforating branch, the first continuing its course as far as the curved cartilages of those ribs, and then, perforating the indigitations of the diaphragm, pass between the external and internal oblique muscles as far as the outer edge of the rectus, where they throw olF cutaneous branches for the sup- ply of the anterior part of the abdominal wall,—the nerve, now greatly diminished in size, pierces the sheath of the rectus, and, reaching its posterior surface, freely supplies it, some of its filaments passing through it to ramify in the integuments over the linea alba. Return- ing now to their perforating branches, we will find that they pierce the external layer of intercostals on the same line as those already described, and then, escaping through the external oblique, are distributed to the in- teguments on the lateral parts of the abdomen. Twelfth, or Last Dorsal—This, as contrasted with those already described, is a large branch emerging be- tween the last rib and the first lumbar vertebra, and running obliquely downwards along the inferior mar- gin of the former, and then piercing the transversalis aponeurosis, divides into two branches, one internal, which can be traced between the internal oblique and transversalis as far as the sheath of the rectus, where it throws ofi" a few cutaneous filaments, and then perfo- rates it to supply the inclosed muscle; the other, external and much larger, which descends obliquely outwards, enveloped in a process of the transversalis aponeu- rosis, under the ligamentum arcuatum falsum, and on the quadratus lumborum,—reaches the crest of the ilium a little anterior to its centre, pierces the internal and external oblique, and divides into a number of cu- taneous twigs, which ramify in the integuments and fat of the glutaeal region. The last intercostal always gives off a branch of communication to the lumbar plexus; but the situation in which it may be found is exceed- ingly variable, and it is always remarkably small. We

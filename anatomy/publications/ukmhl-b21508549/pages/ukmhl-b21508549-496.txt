486 THE JTOSCULAR SYSTEM- ing prolonged over the surface of the flexor brevis mi- nimi digiti to the base of the first phalanx, to which it is attached; the external margin is continuous with the dorsal fascia, while the internal ascends in conjunction with the middle portion to form a septum separating the external from the middle set of muscles. Internal Division of the Plantar Fascia arises from the internal annular ligament, passes forwards, and, reaching the first phalanx of the great toe, receives a shp from the middle division, and is inserted into sides ot that articulation by a slip on each margin, the internal edge being attached to the inner side of the tarsus, whi e the outer sends upwards a process which with the middle portion forms the internal intermuscular septum, i his fascia not only binds down the plantar muscles, but it also preserves the arch of the foot, which it strengthens durin<- progression. The muscles of the plantar region are numerous, and may be divided into four layers : in the first there are three muscles:—abductor poilicis, flexor digitorum brevis, and the abductor minimi digiti. Abductor PoLLicis.-Fleshy and broad behmd ten- dinous in front. It arises from the interna tubercle on the OS calcis, and from the internal annular ligament fascia, and intermuscular septum, passes forwards and inwards, and is inserted into the inner side of the base ot the first phalanx of the great toe. Relations—It is covered by the fascia and lies on the long flexor tendons, posterior tibial ^^^^f nerves, which separate its two heads; also on the flexor poilicis brevis and tibialis anticus tendon. Action.—To flex the great toe. Flexor Digitoru^i Brevis.—Triangular, arises nar- row and tendinous from the internal tubercle of the os calcis, internal annular lig'^^^f' f^^^^^'.^^^.T^road cular septum; it passes forwards, becommg flat^^^j-oad, and fleshy, then divides into four ^^lV%'Y^l'^i;^Zv responding number of tendons are attached; these enter he' fibrou's sheaths with the long Aexor tendons,^a^^^ after being split by the latter, are inserted into the middle phalanges of the four outer toes.

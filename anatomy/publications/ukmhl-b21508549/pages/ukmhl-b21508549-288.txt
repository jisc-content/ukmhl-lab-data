THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM. 278 In addition to these there are some accessory slips that are only present in some cases; the first arising from the hamular process and internal pterygoid plate, passing downwards over the tendon of the tensor palati, expand, and are attached to the mucous surface of the superior constrictor; this is often connected to the soft palate, and contained in its mucous fold (Albinus); the name of pterygo-pharyngeus has been applied to it. A fleshy band arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone between the levator palati and the pharyngeal aponeurosis, with which it is blended; this sometimes expands and invests the Eustachian tube, and is then continued as far as the palato-pharyngeus, which may have induced Winslow to consider it as a distinct mus- cle, under the name of salpingo-pharyngeiis, on account of its attachment to the Eustachian tube, but the term petro-pharyngeus appears more applicable. A small fasci- culus, more like ligament than muscle, arises from the spine of the sphenoid bone, internal to the internal lateral ligament of the lower jaw, and external to the Eustachian tube, over which it arches downwards, to be attached to the pharynx (Riolauus). In the majority of cases this is merely a process of that ligament, forming an arch be- neath the Eustachian tube, becoming continuous with the pharyngeal aponeurosis; it is named spheno-pharyn- geus. An occipito-pharyngeus has also been described, arising from the cuneiform process, and descending to be inserted with its fellow of the opposite side into the middle line; this has no existence, but sometimes a few fibres of the rectus capitis anticus major are attached to the pharynx, which may have been confounded with a distinct muscle. The pharynx is supplied by the ascending pharyngeal, palatine, superior, and inferior thyroid arteries, also by branches from the internal ca- rotid and lingual; the pharyngeal plexus of nerves is destined for it solely, as well as branches from the su- perior and inferior laryngeal and glosso-pharyngeal. Action. It will beobserved, that thebag of thepharynx is attached to fixed points, lying at its superior part, that serve to keep its walls apart. At the highest limit it is stretched between the pterygoid plates; beneath this, between the rami of the jaw, and again, below the latter,

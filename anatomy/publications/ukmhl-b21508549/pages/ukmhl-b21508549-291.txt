281 VELUM PENDULUM PALATI. Velum Pendulum Palati.—Composed of a double fold of mucous membrane, a distinct fibrous, or aponeu- rotic layer, with the expanded attachments of five pair of muscles, presents a quadrilateral outline, with the uvula projecting from the lower margin; the anterior superior border is attached to the posterior edge of the palate plates of the palate bones, continuous in this po- sition with the mucous membrane of the mouth and nose; the posterior inferior margin presents a double curve or arch, with tlie projecting uvula forming the centre; the nasal surface is convex and looks upwards and backwards; the oral, concave, looks downwards and forwards; the edges laterally are attached to the superior constrictor. Now dissect off the mucous membrane from the nasal surface, and also from the inner aspect of the pharynx, and thus will be brought into view three pair of muscles, namely, levator, tensor palati, and motor uvulse. Levator Palatl—Roimd, thick, and fleshy above, broad and expanded below; it arises by a short tendon from the petrous portion of the temporal bone in front of the carotid foramen; also from the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube on its posterior surface; it passes at first downwards and forwards, then expanding, turns inwards, and is inserted into the dorsum of the soft pa- late, extending from the posterior to the anterior edge of that membrane; some of its fibres terminating in the palatine aponeurosis, others crossing the middle line to become continuous Avith those on the opposite side; these latter are short and often tendinous in structure. Relations.—Externally with the tensor palati and su- perior constrictor, also the Eustachian tube; internally with the mucous membrane: its horizontal portion is covered by the motor uvulse, and lies on the palato-pha- ryngeus. Action.—To raise the soft palate. Tensor vel Circumflexus Palati—Fleshy above, tendinous below; it arises from the fossa navicularis at the root of the internal pterygoid plate, from the base of the spine of the sphenoid, and anterior surface of the Eustachian tube. It forms a thin, fleshy fasciculus, flat- tened from side to side, descends along the internal

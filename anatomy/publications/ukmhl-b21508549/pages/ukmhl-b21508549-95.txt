THE OCCIPITAL BONE. 85 on reaching the foramen magnum, bifurcates into two processes, which surround its edges and meet again in front. The hole thus formed is one of great importance, —oval in shape from before backwards, apparently- larger on its internal than external aspect; it gives passage to the medulla oblongata and its membranes to the vertebral and spinal arteries, and to the spinal acces- sory nerve. As we pass along its margins on its inferior surface we meet with the condyles, situated anterior to the transverse axis of the hole, of an oval shape, converg- ing anteriorly, covered with cartilage, looking down- wards, forwards, and outwards, to articulate with the ob- lique processes of the atlas; on their internal surface is a small tubercle, for the insertion of the cheek or mode- rator ligaments; externally they become continuous, ■with a process somewhat elevated, and extending directly outwards,—the jugular or transverse, which gives at- tachment to the rectus capitis lateralis, and forms the posterior boundary of the jugular or posterior lacerated foramen. Immediately above the root of the condyle are two foramina,—one, anteriorly large, directed for- wards and outwards—the anterior condyloid, through which is transmitted the lingual or ninth nerve, and the small occipito-meningeal artery; the other much smaller, directed backwards and outwards, sometimes altogether absent,—the posterior condyloid, for a small vein which communicates with the lateral sinus inter- nally, and the vertebral vein externally. The basilar process, which lies in front of the foramen magnum, is thick and quadrilateral in shape ; it is convex and rough on its inferior surface, giving attachment to the following parts from behind forwards :—most poste- riorly, and to the lip of the opening, the apparatus liga- mentosus colli; secondly, to the broad and cord-like por- tions of the occipito-atloid ligament; thirdly, to the rectus capitus anticus minor; fourthly, to the rectus major; fifthly, to the middle; and sixthly, to the supe- rior constrictors of the pharynx;—and lastly, towards its anterior part, it is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx. The sides of the basilar process are rough superiorly, to articulate with the edge of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; anteriorly, it is

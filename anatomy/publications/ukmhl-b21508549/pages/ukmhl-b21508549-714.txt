704 NERVOUS STSTEM. around the radius and under the tendon of the supina- tor longus; and, reaching the back of the fore-arm, it becomes subcutaneous a little above the annular liga- ment, and now receives the name of dorsalis manu; it here divides into two branches,—an external and inter- nal; the former, whicb is very small, running down- wards and outwards along the external side of the thumb to supply the integuments of this part; while the latter, subdividing into two,—one of which proceeds to the cleft between the thumb and index finger, and the other between the index and middle,—again divides each into two for the supply of the opposed sides of the digits of those spaces, the most internal generally communi- cating with the dorsal of the xxlnar. The other terminal branch of the musculo-spiral, or posterior interosseous, is larger than that already described. It passes back- wards and downwards, perforating the supinator brevis, and lying close to the neck of the radius, but to its outer side; and on reaching the back of the fore-arm divides into two sets of branches,—a superficial and deep: the former by numerous filaments supplying the muscles of the same name, while the latter, having dis- tributed its twigs to the deeper set, continues its course downwards, but very much reduced in size, passes through the fourth groove of the radius, and under the tendon of the extensor communis, to be distributed oy gangliform filaments to the structures composing the carpus. „i Humeral Branches of the Musculo-spiral—Ihese consist of, firstly, an internal cutaneous, usually double, arising very high up, which, after proceeding vertically downwards for a short distance, perforates the fascia, and becoming subcutaneous, continues its course, sup- plying the integuments of the inner and back-part of the arm as far as the olecranon process; secondly, se- veral muscular branches fur the triceps, with one ex- tremely long for the anconeus; and thirdly, the spiral cutaneous, rather a large branch, which comes off frorn the nerve as it lies to the outside of the humerus; it perforates the external head of the triceps, then the fascia, and, continuing its course downwards and back- wards is distributed to the integument of the outer

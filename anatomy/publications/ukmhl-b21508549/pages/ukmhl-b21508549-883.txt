873 VENOUS SYSTEM. neck it receives the following:—One branch of the fa- cial, lateral cutaneous veins of the neck, transversalis colli and humeri, and a small branch of communication from the cephalic, passing over and sometimes under the clavicle. This vein possesses two valves,—one as it crosses the sterno-mastoid, and the second where it ter- minates, and in this latter situation a dilatation occurs, always augmented in cases where obstructive disease of the heart or lungs is present; these valves are, however, merely rudimentary. We have seen this vein totally absent, dnd in one case double. The external jugular is occasionally selected for phlebotomy, an operation which should be performed in the following manner:— Rotate the head to the opposite side, and place the thumb of the left hand on the vein near the posterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, and then introduce the lancet in a direction upwards and backwards, or contrary to the fibres of the platysma myhoides, the pressure being continued until the wound is closed: first, to prevent the descent of the venous blood, and secondly, to avert the entrance of air and its passage towards the heart, a danger which is much exaggerated. Temporal Vein, or Temporo-facial, commences by superficial, deep, and middle branches. The superficial is formed by the temporo-frontal and temporo-occipital plexuses, which, uniting, produce a trunk, that, passing downwards over the horizontal root of the zygoma, is joined by the transverse facial vein. Middle Temporal commences by the confluence of the palpebral and orbital veins, and passing backwards, at first between the two layers of the temporal aponeu- rosis, becomes then deeper, being situated between the fascia and muscle where it runs downwards and back- wards, and, piercing the fascia from within outwards, opens into the temporal trunk anterior to the meatus auditorius externus; the deep branch, which may be called the internal maxillary, commences by the fol- lowing:—Venas comites of the middle meningeal artery, inferior dental, deep masseteric, pterygoid, and temporal, and, running backwards, joins the temporal, but pre- vious to this receiving the transverse facial,—a small vein commencing by tlie masseteric plexus and passing

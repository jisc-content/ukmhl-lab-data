670 NERVOUS SYSTEM. Cloquet's ganglion is exposed by sawing a wedge-shaped piece from the symphisis of the superior maxillary bones, and when this is done, a fusiform mass is seen, occupy- ing the foramen incisivum, its principal bulk being com- posed of dense periosteum, on the removal of which some fatty areolar tissue appears, and on unravelling this web, a communication is observed between the naso- palatine and the palatine nerves. We also have some- times observed a slight enlargement with a grey tinge at the point of union, but by no means constantly.^ This ganglion is described as being large in the graminivbra, and especially in the horse, in which it receives a branch from the olfactory. Cruveilhier describes the naso- palatine nerve as passing through the bone to that por- tion of the palate behind the incisor teeth; and believes, with Arnold, that Cloquet's ganglion has no existence, but we think the opinion only errs in being too general. Vidian Nerve pursues an exceedingly long course, being first without the cranium, then within that cavity, also in the tympanum or middle ear; and lastly, with- out the cranial cavity again. It arises from the poste- rior part of Meckel's ganglion, and passes outwards and backwards through the pterygoid canal, then pierces the cartilage which closes the foramen lacerum anterius in basi cranii, between the Eustachian tube and the carotid artery,â€”here dividing into an inferior or carotid branch, and a superior or cranial, the former being the larger of the two, and passing upwards in the carotid canal, anastomosing with the sixth, small petrosal, and sympathetic branches, to form the carotid plexus; while the latter, or the great petrosal branch, passes backwards in a groove, on the upper surface of the petrous por- tion of the temporal bone, invested by dura mater, and accompanied in its course by a branch of the middle meningeal artery, ancl enters the hiatus Fallopu, which leads into the aqueduct of the same name, in which it passes downwards, backwards, and outwards, commu- nicating with the intumescentia gangliforrais of the por- tio dura, which it again leaves, and enters the posterior wall of the tympanum, running downwards between the long crus of the incus and the manubrium of the mal- leus, and escapes through an aperture internal to the

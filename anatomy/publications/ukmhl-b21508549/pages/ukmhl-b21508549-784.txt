774 ARTERIES AND VEINS. Stance of parts and organs, and, gradually coalescing, form trunks by which the venous blood is poured into the heart; their coats being much thinner than m the arteries, and when empty they collapse; however, after death their-cavities are usually found distended. Ihe elements of the venous tunics are similar to the arterial, but not developed to a like degree; thus, externally a thin areolo-fibrous tunic corresponds to the same coat of the arteries, internal to which is a fibrous layer, con- sisting of an external circular set of fibres, extremely weak, supported on a longitudinal fibrous tumc, and be- tween these, unstriped muscular filaments are situated; while again, more internally there is a fenestrated layer supporting the epithelium on its deep surface. The veins are provided with valves, most numerous m the deep set, but totally deficient in those of the neck sinuses, abdominal veins, vena azygos, and iliacs as well as in the cav^, but the external jugular ^orms ^^ e^ ception to the absence of valves m the cervical veins, it po'ssessing two, but very faintly marked. In the ar^e vessels three valves are opposed to each f ter, wh^^^^^^^^ the smaller there are but two, and again m the smallest they are absent altogether. A venous valve is formed by Replication of the serous lining, contammg between its layers a process of the fibrous venous wall each valve presenting a convex edge which is attached to the Inner surface of the vein, and a concave margin, free^ look ng towards the heart, whilst the vessel imme- diately above it exhibits a slight dilatation.
